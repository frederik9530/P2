      "bodyText": "The foreign affairs department had no idea Julie Bishop was taking a job with one of Australia\u2019s biggest foreign aid contractors until it was publicly announced, internal documents show. Documents obtained by the Guardian through freedom-of-information laws suggest the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was blindsided by a July announcement from Palladium, a multinational aid contractor, that Bishop was joining its board. Bishop, the former foreign affairs minister, had only left parliament months earlier, and the appointment prompted Labor to allege a breach of ministerial standards. Inside the department, Bishop\u2019s appointment prompted a flurry of urgent emails between senior officials. One unnamed official asked Dfat deputy secretary Clare Walsh to organise an \u201curgent\u201d briefing on the announcement for question time, seemingly aware of the likelihood for controversy. \u201cGiven DFAT association with palladium [sic] through the aid program, would it be possible to get an urgent [question time brief] on the Bishop board press and any other angles that might run on this?\u201d the unnamed official asked Walsh. Subsequent documents reveal that Dfat was not aware of Bishop\u2019s plans to take the job prior to Palladium\u2019s announcement. Talking points prepared soon after the announcement advised that, if asked, the department should say that it had no knowledge of Bishop\u2019s appointment before it was announced. The talking points also advise the government to say there was no noticeable increase to Palladium\u2019s share of Australia\u2019s foreign aid program under Bishop\u2019s watch. They also advised the government to say that Bishop would not give Palladium any advantage in bidding for future work, and that she did not have direct influence on procurement in her former role as minister. Bishop has consistently denied any suggestion she breached ministerial standards, saying she knows her obligations and will comply with them fully. The current federal ministerial standards require that ministers do not lobby, advocate for or have business meetings with government, parliamentarians or the defence force on \u201cany matters on which they have had official dealings\u201d in the past 18 months. The standards also say that ministers should not use information they have obtained in office for private gain. The controversy involving Bishop and Christopher Pyne, a former defence minister who went to work for consulting giant EY, prompted a Senate inquiry that held hearings earlier this month. Palladium has been a huge recipient of work through Australia\u2019s foreign aid program. In 2016/17 alone, about one-quarter of Australia\u2019s aid program was outsourced to private firms.

As the main spokesman for the Pacific Small Island Developing States at the 2009 UN climate conference in Copenhagen he proposed amending the draft climate treaty to require countries to limit warming to 1.5C, a proposal that was rejected.

      "bodyText": "It is the final night of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu and the Fijian prime minister is explaining how to drink kava. \u201cYou clap first,\u201d says Frank Bainimarama, as the smooth wooden bowl is passed around the circle. \u201cThen you have to gulp in one go; then you clap again \u2013 one, two, three.\u201d As with so many things in the region, there is a metaphor involving the sea. \u201cTsunami is the full bowl,\u201d he says, explaining the different levels to which the small bowl is filled from the large tanoa, or kava bowl, in the middle of the circle. \u201cThen full tide, low tide.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a social drink,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can sit for hours and drink this stuff and tell stories about nothing.\u201d Among the stories the prime minister tells over the next three hours as each person gulps down a dozen bowls of kava \u2013 about his fear of flying, his views on Trump, why he seized power in the infamous coup that saw him become Fiji\u2019s leader \u2013 there is one theme he returns to over and over: the climate crisis. Though the Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world\u2019s population, the climate crisis is already having a devastating impact on the region. The ocean, which has been the source of much of the region\u2019s food and resources, is now the site of impending catastrophe. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs and warming that leads to more frequent and more severe cyclones all threaten the region. As the crisis has hit the Pacific, leaders have emerged. Despite the tiny populations of their countries, they have had an outsized influence on the global climate fight. As the world\u2019s leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly and climate summit, we speak to three Pacific leaders who have been on the frontline of the climate crisis and are taking the fight to New York. Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji The fight against the climate crisis has been the great second act of Frank Bainimarama\u2019s prime ministership. After his role in the 2006 coup, which saw the Fijian commodore seize power and then refuse to call elections for eight years (Fiji has since held two, both of which Bainimarama has won), Bainimarama was ostracised by the international community. But in recent years, he has emerged as a leader in the global climate fight, becoming the president of COP23 in 2017, the UN\u2019s leading climate change body, and the only Pacific leader to have held the title. \u201cI and my officials come from a little tiny island and we had to go onstage and fight these big emitters,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be standing up on stage telling the big emitters: \u2018Come down off your high horse and do what needs to be done to fight this\u2019.\u201d But Bainimarama says it was important to have a Pacific leader in the role. \u201cBy then we knew what climate change was doing, especially to Pacific Island nations,\u201d says Bainimarama. \u201cWhen we took up the presidency, our fight was really the fight of the Pacific and the vulnerable islands, low-lying islands.\u201d While Fiji, which is one of the most populous and more economically-developed countries in the Pacific, is not considered among the most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis \u2013 that dubious honour goes to Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands \u2013 it is still feeling the effects. \u201cEverywhere I go in Fiji there are only two things people want, especially on the coastline. One is a seawall, the other is a hurricane shelter,\u201d says Bainimarama. In 2016, Fiji was devastated by Cyclone Winston which killed 44 people and inflicted damage equal to one third of the country\u2019s GDP. Under Bainimarama\u2019s leadership, Fiji has offered refuge to the entire populations of Tuvalu and Kiribati in the event that the countries become uninhabitable due to the climate crisis. He is also willing to take the fight to much bigger powers, frequently making headlines and causing diplomatic tensions for his blunt assessments of the behaviour of wealthy countries unwilling to curb emissions (including neighbouring Australia). At this year\u2019s climate summit and General Assembly in New York he will be demanding countries take immediate action to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures and calling upon developed countries to mobilise at least $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. \u201cOur fight will never stop,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<p>National parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty have not done enough to protect nature or welcome diverse visitors, and extra government funding must help drive radical change, according to a review.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-parks-review-launched\">independent review</a>, commissioned by the former environment secretary Michael Gove, praises the work of England\u2019s 44 \u201cnational landscapes\u201d, including the Lake District and Dartmoor, but calls for a new focus to stop declines in nature and welcome working-class and black and minority ethnic visitors.</p> <p>The review, led by the writer Julian Glover, calls for parks, which cover nearly a quarter of England, to have a clear national mission to reverse environmental decline, assisted by 1,000 new rangers. It says every schoolchild should be given the chance to visit the parks and spend a night under the stars.</p> <p>\u201cNational parks and AONBs have done their best to protect nature but it\u2019s not been good enough,\u201d said Glover. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/22/ukmiss-almost-all-2020-nature-targets-official-report-admits\">Nature is in crisis</a> in our protected landscapes just as it\u2019s in crisis outside them. We\u2019re not blaming national parks and AONBs but we want to give them to the tools to do more, and recover declining nature.\u201d</p> <p>Glover said the national parks were created after the second world war to serve the whole country and have proved \u201cimmensely popular\u201d, managing natural beauty well, particularly when receiving just \u00a348m annual government funding between them.

      "bodyText": "National parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty have not done enough to protect nature or welcome diverse visitors, and extra government funding must help drive radical change, according to a review. The independent review, commissioned by the former environment secretary Michael Gove, praises the work of England\u2019s 44 \u201cnational landscapes\u201d, including the Lake District and Dartmoor, but calls for a new focus to stop declines in nature and welcome working-class and black and minority ethnic visitors. The review, led by the writer Julian Glover, calls for parks, which cover nearly a quarter of England, to have a clear national mission to reverse environmental decline, assisted by 1,000 new rangers. It says every schoolchild should be given the chance to visit the parks and spend a night under the stars. \u201cNational parks and AONBs have done their best to protect nature but it\u2019s not been good enough,\u201d said Glover. \u201cNature is in crisis in our protected landscapes just as it\u2019s in crisis outside them. We\u2019re not blaming national parks and AONBs but we want to give them to the tools to do more, and recover declining nature.\u201d Glover said the national parks were created after the second world war to serve the whole country and have proved \u201cimmensely popular\u201d, managing natural beauty well, particularly when receiving just \u00a348m annual government funding between them. National parks generate more than \u00a320bn for the rural economy, and support 75,000 jobs. He added: \u201cBut our country has changed and we need to change the way we run our landscapes to keep pace with that. One thing is to make sure everyone feels welcome in those landscapes and the other is to make sure the way they are run reflects the country as a whole.\u201d The review calls for the boards of national parks to better represent modern Britain \u2013 more than 99% of board members are white \u2013 and for a new programme to increase ethnic minority visits and ensure that minority groups see the parks as places for them. Although more than 66% of people live within half an hour of a national park or AONB and they receive 94 million visitors each year, Glover said too many people don\u2019t know what they are for. The review calls for a new national park in the Chilterns and a new \u201cnational forest\u201d covering areas such as Sherwood Forest, to help increase woodland to fight the climate crisis. It wants long-term programmes to increase black and minority ethnic visitors, better information to guide visitors, affordable homes within the parks, and consideration of expanding open access rights \u2013 the right to roam \u2013 in the landscapes. Other ideas in the review include improved transport to help widen access, bike racks for buses as occurs in Switzerland, and electric bikes and charging points for electric vehicles. There are currently almost no electric vehicle charging points in some vast national parks. The environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, welcomed the \u201cspirit of ambition\u201d and said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which commissioned the review, would \u201ccarefully consider\u201d its recommendations.

No protests were authorised in China, the world\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another. \u201cChinese youth have their own methods,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.\u201d There was action, however, in Taiwan, where dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks. In Thailand, hundreds of young people demonstrated outside the environment ministry in Bangkok and dropped to the ground feigning death. \u201cWe are the future and we deserve better,\u201d said 12-year-old Ralyn \u2018Lilly\u2019 Satidtanasarn \u2013 who has been dubbed \u201cThailand\u2019s Greta\u201d for her campaign against plastic bag use in a country where each person uses 3,000 throwaway bags a year. In India\u2019s capital Delhi, where the suffocating air pollution was the target of the demonstration, Rishika Singh, 18, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the poorest who suffer the most. The rich are better off \u2013 they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort.\u201d An armoured personnel carrier was deployed in the Afghan capital, Kabul, to protect about 100 young people as they marched, led by a group of young women carrying a banner emblazoned with \u201cFridays for Future\u201d. Fardeen Barakzai, one of the organisers and head of the local climate activist group, Oxygen, said: \u201dWe want to do our part. We as the youth of our country know the problem of climate change.\u201d Africa In Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi some young protesters wore hats and outfits made from plastic bottles to highlight the dangers of plastic waste, a major threat to people living in the developing world. Strikes took place in several Nigerian cities, including Lagos, which is often beset by formidable quantities of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU. \u201cLeaders should listen to what the climate scientists are saying. No leader should forfeit the future of younger generation,\u201d said Oladosu Adenike, an activist in the Fridays4Future campaign in Nigeria. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a way out of this,\u201d said Natalie Kapsosideris, 16. \u201cThe future looks really dismal at this point. There\u2019s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us \u2026 and it\u2019s all because they want to make money.\u201d Europe Demonstrations took place in most European countries, with huge crowds in Warsaw, Poland and more than 1.4 million people taking action across Germany. In Berlin, demonstrators blocked roads and protested outside the German chancellery. In response, Angela Merkel announced a \u20ac50bn package of new measures to curb carbon emissions and review progress towards reaching its climate goals by 2030. Merkel said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Thunberg\u2019s motto \u201cunite behind the science\u201d. \u201cThe chances are very good, they have grown, that we will reach our climate goals this time,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cIf we should realise we\u2019re not on track, then we will correct this.\u201d In Brussels one rather poetic placard read: \u201cRespect existence or Expect resistance!\u201d Thousands took to the streets in Dublin. Luke Corkery, a university student, said in a tweet: \u201cBlown away \u2026 This is a movement led by young people across the globe. We\u2019re not just looking for an excuse for a day off school or college; we\u2019re standing up for the future of our planet.\u201d Americas The global protest culminated in New York which was anticipating one of the largest climate strikes. Education chiefs in the city gave every one of the 1.1 million children in its schools permission to attend the climate strike and hear Thunberg speak at a rally at the United Nations headquarters. \u201cGreta! Greta! Greta!\u201d the crowd chanted as she took to the stage. The 16-year-old directed her speech to the students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?\u201d She sparked laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and \u201ctell us they really, really admire what we do\u201d yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. \u201cWe demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?\u201d It was estimated that more than 250,000 people turned out for the protests in New York, with thousands more demonstrating in Boston, Miami and San Francisco. In Mexico City, protesters chanted \u201cSe ve, se siente, la tierra est\u00e1 caliente\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.\u201d In Brazil, where recent fires in the Amazon have drawn attention to the climate emergency, students attended protests in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and the capital Bras\u00edlia. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2019. In an earlier version the words of Aman Sharma were incorrectly attributed to , a climate activist who tweeted a video interview with Sharma.",

Friday\u2019s program in Washington ran like clockwork while everybody had a script. But once we\u2019d cleared the pomp and circumstance of the ceremonial welcome for Scott Morrison on the South Lawn of the White House, once the Australian press pack tumbled out of the sparkling autumn sunshine into the Oval Office \u2013 we discovered Trump in an expansive mood. The leader of the free world kicked off proceedings by announcing the administration was now imposing sanctions on Iran, targeting the national bank, in response to Tehran\u2019s alleged involvement in drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities last weekend. As could have been predicted, these were the biggest sanctions anyone had ever seen. \u201cThe highest sanctions ever imposed on a country,\u201d Trump purred. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done it to this level.\u201d The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, then appeared in the corner of the room, just in case we\u2019d failed to be sufficiently awed by the scale of the undertaking. \u201cThis is very big,\u201d Mnuchin duly reported, and departed. The president then volunteered he intended to have a quiet word to Scott Morrison over the course of their meetings on Friday, Washington time, about potential military options in Iran, and whether Australia might be persuaded to join a new coalition of the willing. \u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing that later,\u201d Trump said.

He then settled his face into an expression he clearly regarded as Delphic. Before we could process the information that Australia might be off to war in Iran, things spiralled. The unheralded military action could be \u2013 wait for it \u2013 nuclear. Trump noted America had renovated the arsenal and acquired new nuclear capability, and the rest of the military was \u201call brand new\u201d. \u201cWe all hope, and Scott hopes, we all pray that we never have to use nuclear,\u201d Trump intoned. It was unclear precisely what Scott\u2019s hopes were just in that moment. I\u2019d hazard a guess the prime minister\u2019s most fervent aspiration was his host would stop talking. Preferably five minutes ago. It could have been my imagination, but it is possible Jenny Morrison\u2019s eyebrows touched her hairline at the precise moment Trump said the word nuclear. With vexed options now tumbling out of Trump\u2019s mouth at a clip, it did seem prudent to check in with the prime minister at this point. What was his position on Australia joining military action in Iran? Morrison soothed.

But of course there was a plot twist. \u201cI think the strong person\u2019s approach, and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint,\u201d Trump said. But the strange out-loud dialogue between bellicose Trump and restrained Trump, a dual personality embodied in a presidency, persisted. \u201cMuch easier to do it the other way. It\u2019s much easier. And Iran knows if they misbehave they are on borrowed time,\u201d the president said. There was another plot twist before day was done.

Following a ceremonial welcome for Morrison on Friday Washington time attended by more than 4,000 guests, Trump praised Morrison\u2019s personal fortitude, describing him as \u201ca man of real, real strength, and a great guy\u201d. The American president signalled he would raise with Morrison a possible military contribution in Iran beyond the current freedom of navigation commitment in the Strait of Hormuz, but later in the day indicated he had not, in fact, raised the issue during a bilateral meeting at the White House. The Australian prime minister made a point of praising the president\u2019s restraint in relation to Iran to date and made no commitment beyond saying the government would consider any request from the administration on its merits. Asked for his view on China, Trump told reporters \u201cwell, obviously, China is a threat to the world in a sense, because they\u2019re building a military faster than anybody, and, frankly, they\u2019re using US money\u201d.

We lost an opportunity to make a big statement at Bournemouth.\u201d Silva refused to elaborate on why he perceives Everton to be judged to a more critical standard than other clubs. When it was put to him that the club\u2019s heavy spending under the major shareholder Moshiri was a factor, he replied: \u201cYes, but let me know if the other clubs don\u2019t have owners as well and don\u2019t spend big money. I know the reason but it is not for me to say it. \u201cIt is up to us to block this out. In our dressing room and inside our club we have to close off from this. \u201cWe give 100% commitment to our shirt, to our club and we are demanding of ourselves. We know our target and what we are fighting for. We have to show personality and everything else we have to block out like ice men and not give it a chance to come into our dressing room.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Larger companies will be obliged to introduce policies for women experiencing the menopause, such as flexible working hours and better awareness for managers, under a Labour policy to be announced at the party\u2019s annual conference. The plan, to be outlined by Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, in a speech to the conference in Brighton, will apply to all firms with more than 250 staff, and is intended to help tackle stigma attached to the menopause. Requirements would include ensuring flexible working, for example allowing different working hours if women\u2019s sleep becomes disrupted during the menopause, or catering for absences due to changing health conditions. Other ideas would be allowing breaks as needed, or rescheduling events such as presentations to fit around potential symptoms, and giving time for medical appointments. This would be set around a wider requirement for employers to recognise that the menopause is not an illness, and thus women needing time off because of it should not be penalised by punitive absence policies. Other changes would mean training managers about how the menopause can affect women, and what assistance they might need, as well as workplace facilities such as access to ventilation facilities and cold water. Managers should also be trained to look for signs of women experiencing difficulties at work because of the menopause, and be able to offer help or point them to outside sources, Labour said. Arguing for the changes, the party noted research showing that 30% of menopausal women said they had taken sick leave due to absence, but that many felt they could not tell their manager why. The same study found that 60% of working women aged 45 to 55 who were experiencing the menopause said it had had a negative impact on them. Butler said: \u201cThis bold policy will support women experiencing the symptoms of menopause in the workplace.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with our report on a fine match at St Mary\u2019s. Night! Nathan Ake speaks \u201cIt feels great. It was a very tough game, but the fans are buzzing and we\u2019re buzzing. The last result against Everton helped our confidence, and you could see that in the first half-hour. We had to fight in the second half, but it\u2019s great to be third in the league.\u201d That\u2019s it! A famous win for Bournemouth, who move to third in the Premier League. They\u2019re an inspiration to almost every club in the land. They had to work so hard in the second half, when Southampton put them under constant pressure, but they stayed firm and Callum Wilson finished the job. Callum Wilson walked the ball into the net after a hideous mix-up between Bednarek and Gunn. They left a bouncing ball to each other on the edge of the D, and Wilson nipped in to seal an historic victory! Bournemouth have won away to Southampton for the first time in their history! 90+3 min Ramsdale makes a good save, plunging to his left to palm away a long-range strike from Boufal. Moments earlier Ake made a vital block from Ings\u2019 shot. 90+3 min Another Bournemouth change: Andrew Surman replaces the impressive Josh King. 90+2 min Bournemouth have a free-kick on the edge of their own area. Ramsdale is not in a hurry to take it. 90 min Lewis Cook plays a fine pass to King, who moves into the area but hits a tame shot that is easily held by Gunn. Four added minutes. 89 min Ward-Prowse\u2019s corner comes to nothing. 88 min Before the corner is taken, Southampton make another change: Nathan Redmond is replaced by Stuart Armstrong. 88 min Ings\u2019 snapshot on the turn is deflected behind for another corner. He\u2019s been very lively since coming on. 87 min Lerma plays the ball straight out of play. Bournemouth, who were so controlled in the first half, are hanging on desperately. 86 min Ward-Prowse chests the ball down neatly to Ings, whose stinging shot from 23 yards is blocked. 85 min Billing cracks the free-kick just wide from 35 yards. That was a fine effort, which curled wickedly, although Gunn almost certainly had it covered. 85 min Bournemouth get a bit of respite by winning a corner and then a free-kick 35 yards from goal. 82 min Another chance for Southampton! Ings\u2019 superb cutback finds Ward-Prowse, whose deflected shot is smuggled away by Ramsdale. That leads to a melee on the six-yard line before Steve Cook welts it clear. 81 min Southampton have had seven shots in the second half, Bournemouth none. 80 min Romeu is booked for a foul on King. 79 min King marauds towards the Southampton area again, and this time Cedric wins the ball off him with a fine challenge just outside the penalty box. 77 min A substitution apiece. Lewis Cook replaces Dominic Solanke for Bournemouth, which suggests a switch to 4-3-3; Danny Ings comes on for Che Adams for Southampton. 77 min Boufal\u2019s imaginative curler from the left edge of the area beats Ramsdale and bounces just wide of the far post. That was a lovely effort. 74 min Cedric\u2019s excellent cross finds its way to Redmond beyond the far post. He takes it down on the chest and hammers a shot that hits the outstretched leg of Stacey and goes behind for a corner. That would have gone in at the near post, because Ramsdale was flat-footed. 72 min It\u2019s all Southampton, as it has been for most of the second half. For all their pressure, however, Ramsdale hasn\u2019t had any difficult saves to make. 70 min \u201cI rather liked VAR in the World Cup, if only because it completely got rid of real nastiness behind the ref,\u201d says Joe Harvey. \u201cHowever, while I hardly think the penalty not given was a clear and obvious error, it seems like they are too conservative overturning calls so far this year. I worry that referees will shade towards not giving penalties in the hope that VAR will give them, and the VAR official will not give them out of respect to the on-field referee. I will say I have yet to see something that appears to be an obvious red card either given or overturned by VAR this year.\u201d 69 min A long-range strike from Boufal is beaten away by the flying Ramsdale, a dramatic but ultimately comfortable save. 68 min Replays suggest that Rico slapped Cedric, but the VAR official decided it wasn\u2019t a red-card offence. Whatever, I\u2019m beyond caring, it\u2019s a complete shambles. 67 min Rico and Cedric have a lively exchange of views after a challenge near the touchline. Nothing to see here. 65 min Stacey is booked for a foul on Bertrand. Southampton\u2019s pressure has been relentless since half-time. 64 min \u201cIt\u2019s a shame Southampton sold Matt Targett,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cHe could have given Angus Gunn something to aim at. I\u2019m here all week.\u201d 63 min Bournemouth make their first change. Ryan Fraser, who apparently wasn\u2019t fit enough to start, replaces the goalscorer Harry Wilson. 61 min This is pulsating stuff! Southampton almost equalise through Ward-Prowse, who steers a shot just over the bar from 20 yards after a lovely dragback on the run from Adams. 60 min: No penalty! Bournemouth will be fuming about that if they don\u2019t win. For what it\u2019s worth - nothing - I think it was a foul on King, but I\u2019m not sure it was a clear and obvious error from the referee. It\u2019s a bit of a mess. 59 min There\u2019s a VAR check on the penalty appeal. This might be given. 59 min King bursts into the area and goes over after a clumsy challenge from Cedric. Chris Kavanagh says no penalty. I\u2019d like to see that again. 57 min Redmond stands up a cross beyond the far post towards Bertrand. He heads it down into the six-yard box, where Ramsdale rushes from his line to grab the ball. This is superb entertaininment. 56 min Redmond shifts the ball away from Billings, 20 yards from goal, and thrashes a rising drive just over the bar with his left foot. It\u2019s all Southampton at the moment. 55 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cIs that Ryan \u2018Plastic\u2019 Bertrand?\u201d It is now! 54 min Adams had probably overrun the ball when Cook fouled him, but I\u2019m not sure that matters. Meanwhile, Harry Wilson is booked for a foul on Boufal. Ward-Prowse scores emphatically, rifling a penalty high to his right. Ramsdale went the wrong way. VAR check: penalty given! Yes, I think that\u2019s the right decision. Adams was just inside the area when he stabbed the ball away from Cook, who sent him flying. 52 min It looked a bit soft but Chris Kavanagh has given it. 49 min A fine move from Southampton. Boufal swings a pass across the field to Cedric, now playing on the right. He steers a cross at ankle height towards Ward-Prowse, whose first-time volley on the run goes just over the bar. 46 min Peep peep! Southampton begin the second half. They\u2019ve made a half-time change, with Ryan Bertrand replacing Kevin Danso. \u201cThe Saints have looked decent in attack,\u201d says Mary Waltz, \u201cbut as soon as they lose the ball the Cherries cut through their midfield and back line without any resistance.\u201d Yes, they\u2019ve been repeatedly exposed on the counter-attack. Bournemouth have been excellent, though; really precise in their passing and movement. Philip Billing and Harry Wilson are terrific signings. Some half-time reading Peep peep! Bournemouth are 45 minutes away from a first ever victory away to Southampton. They\u2019ve been cool and clinical amid the maelstrom and would be even further ahead but for that pesky VAR rightly disallowing Josh King\u2019s goal. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 43 min Billing is down, holding his face, after a collision at a Southampton corner. He took Redmond\u2019s shoulder in the face, though it wasn\u2019t deliberate. Unlike this. 42 min Redmond, who has been Southampton\u2019s liveliest attacker, hits a fierce, wobbling shot from 25 yards that is punched behind for a corner by Ramsdale. It was a comfortable enough save. 39 min Eddie Howe is such a brilliant manager. I hope he\u2019s the next England manager, whenever Gareth Southgate hangs up his waistcoat. 38 min Bournemouth break agian, with King\u2019s shot deflecting behind for a corner. Their purpose and precision on the counter-attack have been superb. 37 min: Ramsdale makes a vital save from Hojbjerg! Redmond\u2019s cutback ricocheted around the box before falling to Hojbjerg in the six-yard box. He hit the ball first time, but Ramsdale made himself big to smother the shot. That was a lovely team goal. Rico fizzed a pass out to Callum Wilson on the left. He played in the underlapping Billing and charged into the area for the return. Billing pulled the ball back towards Wilson, Callum I think, but Harry Wilson got in front of him and Vestegaard to clip a precise first-time shot into the far corner. Excellent finish. Bournemouth go 2-0 up for the second time! 34 min Nothing comes of it. 33 min This is a very open game. Southampton are having most of the ball, but Bournemouth look dangerous on the counter-attack. Rico\u2019s corner from the right is punched behind by Gunn for another corner, this time on the left... 29 min Redmond plays a crisp pass across the line of the penalty area to Hojbjerg, whose shot is blocked by Stacey. He could, probably should have played a reverse pass to the overlapping Cedric, who would have been through on the left of the area. 28 min Ward-Prowse slashes over the bar from 22 yards. 26 min That\u2019s when VAR works perfectly, because it\u2019s an objective judgement. Yes, it\u2019s been disallowed. It was a beautiful finish from King, swept into the far corner from Solanke\u2019s pass. But replays showed he was just offside. Hang on, this may be VARed. Bournemouth go two up with a superb goal! 22 min \u201cEvening Rob!\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cYou know what football lacks? Great nicknames. How on earth has Kevin Danso not been re-named as Tiny, or Ryan \u2018House of\u2019 Fraser? The one I really want is Harry \u2018Prime Minister\u2019 Wilson. (Yeah, it\u2019s been a long week.) Don\u2019t forget the old favourites \u2013 \u2018One Size\u2019 Fitz Hall and Kiki \u2018Chris\u2019 Musampa. 21 min Southampton are playing at a furious pace, even by their standards. 20 min Lerma is booked for taking Hojbjerg out off the ball. 19 min Boufal surges down the inside-left channel, away from Billing, only to mishit a tame shot through to Ramsdale. He looks lively, though, as he did in Southampton\u2019s last home fixture against Manchester United. 16 min King leads a Bournemouth break, haring down the left before crossing low towards Callum Wilson. Vestegaard makes an important interception. 15 min Replays show there was a slight push on Danso, who was challenging the goalscorer Ake, by Callum Wilson. It might have been a foul, but I don\u2019t think it crossed the VAR threshold. 14 min \u201cOn that goal,\u201d says Mary Waltz, \u201cSouthampton looked like they were watching a movie rather than playing a match.\u201d 13 min Southampton look thoroughly affronted at going behind. Boufal plays a one-two with Adams and hits a sudden shot from 25 yards that is blocked by Cook. Bournemouth take the lead! It was a simple goal: Rico\u2019s inswinging corner from the right, and an emphatic downward header from Ake on the six-yard line. 9 min Southampton, as is their wont, are giving Bournemouth no time whatsoever on the ball. But Stacey combines neatly with Harry Wilson to win the first corner. 6 min Cedric\u2019s speculative cutback is screwed wide of the far post by Ward-Prowse, arriving late in the box. It was a tricky chance as it bounced just in front of him, and he couldn\u2019t steer it on target. 5 min It\u2019s been a frantic start, as you\u2019d expect. Nothing to report as yet. 2 min Southampton\u2019s full-backs have swapped, with Danso on the right and Cedric on the left. I suppose that\u2019s because of Bournemouth\u2019s inverted wide players. 1 min Peep peep! Bournemouth get the match under way. They are in their dark blue away strip; Southampton are wearing red and white. The players emerge from the tunnel to flashing lights and dramatic music. There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere. The winner tonight, if there is one, will move to third in the table for the next 17 hours or so. Pre-match reading Southampton (4-2-2-2) Gunn; Danso, Bednarek, Vestegaard, Cedric; Romeu, Hojbjerg; Ward-Prowse, Boufal; Adams, Redmond.

The New Forest derby, as this is apparently known, is a bit of a newfangled rivalry. The two teams met only twice between 1960 and 2010, when they lived in different worlds, and overall this is only their 30th match. Bournemouth, in fact, have never won away to Southampton \u2013 not at St Mary\u2019s, not at the Dell, not even when they were called Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic. The last eight meetings between these sides have occurred in the Premier League, though; and with Portsmouth still recovering from their big crash a decade ago, these two are fighting for supremacy on the south coast. Bournemouth won that unofficial title in the last two seasons by finishing above Southampton. They are above Southampton now, too, albeit only on goals scores. Both teams have started the season pretty well and sit in the top half of the table. These are two really likeable sides, with ambitious managers who play progressive football and want to achieve something more meaningful than simply preserving the status quo. The brilliant Eddie Howe has made all kinds of history at Bournemouth; tonight, there\u2019s a chance to make some more. Kick off is at 8pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>The wait is over for Bournemouth. Finally, at the 16th time of asking, they tasted victory on Southampton soil and climbed to the dizzy heights of third place in the table in the process. The south coast bragging rights are theirs and Bournemouth\u2019s travelling supporters were able to indulge in a little schadenfreude at the end too, after a calamitous defensive mix-up handed Callum Wilson the easiest goal he will ever score.</p> <p>It was a strange game in many ways, with Southampton enjoying 65% possession and registering 25 shots to Bournemouth\u2019s six, yet the only statistic that matters is the scoreline. Bournemouth also had a goal ruled out for offside after VAR intervened and a strong penalty appeal turned down despite the decision being reviewed. Technology was not on their side here but it did not need to be on a night when Southampton were such obliging opponents.</p> <p>Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side were undone by a routine set-piece when Nathan Ak\u00e9 headed home almost unchallenged, and that poor concession set the tone for a flat first-half performance. Bournemouth, in contrast, looked dangerous whenever they counterattacked in that period and it says much for their character that they responded so well to seeing a superb goal for Joshua King chalked off. \u201cThat probably was the defining moment, how we would react to that setback,\u201d Eddie Howe, Bournemouth\u2019s manager, said.</p> <p>The goal that Harry Wilson scored 10 minutes later came at the end of a lovely move that prised open Southampton\u2019s right flank, and from that moment on it was hard to see a way back for the home team. James Ward-Prowse gave them some hope with a second-half penalty and there was plenty of pressure thereafter, yet the glaring absence of a cutting edge up front \u2013 Danny Ings and Che Adams have scored only once between them this season \u2013 raises major questions about where the goals will come from in this team.</p> <p>Bournemouth have no such concerns and there were wild scenes at the end as they celebrated a landmark victory. \u201cAt last,\u201d said Howe, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice feeling. Thankfully next time we come back that [sequence of games without a win] won\u2019t be the topic of conversation. It was a really nice moment for us all to enjoy together. When you consider how far this club has come in recent years and how bleak the outlook was at times, to think that we would win here in the Premier League \u2013 that\u2019s something that at one stage we would never have thought possible. So it\u2019s a nice moment to acknowledge that.\u201d</p> <p>The game was only 10 minutes old when Ak\u00e9 put Bournemouth ahead. Diego Rico delivered an inswinging corner and Ak\u00e9 was able to get a free run at the ball. Kevin Danso was the nearest player to Ak\u00e9 when the Dutchman made contact but powerless to prevent him from heading powerfully past Angus Gunn.</p> <p>Everyone in the stadium thought it was 2-0 when King expertly curled the ball into the far corner after running on to Dominic Solanke\u2019s threaded pass, but VAR correctly identified that the Norwegian had strayed just offside. If that was a warning for Southampton, it went unheeded. Philip Billing\u2019s break from deep implored King to release him in the inside-left channel, and it was a lovely cutback from the central midfielder that picked out the run of Harry Wilson. Darting across Jannik Vestergaard, the Welshman scored his third Bournemouth goal with an incisive first-time finish. \u201cHe\u2019s got that knack of popping up with big goals,\u201d added Howe.</p> <p>Hasenh\u00fcttl changed things around both tactically and in terms of personnel, and was rewarded with a goal early in the second half, when Ward-Prowse emphatically converted from the spot after Steve Cook had clumsily brought down Adams. Bournemouth were then denied a penalty when Chris Kavanagh, the referee, waved away their appeals and VAR decided against overturning that decision.</p> <p>It made for an anxious finale for Bournemouth until a total breakdown in communication between Gunn and Jan Bednarek gave Callum Wilson the chance to roll the ball into the net in front of the jubilant visiting supporters. \u201cThey were very clinical and we weren\u2019t,\u201d lamented Hasenh\u00fcttl.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/sep/20/southampton-v-bournemouth-premier-league-live\">Southampton 1-3 Bournemouth: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>",

The south coast bragging rights are theirs and Bournemouth\u2019s travelling supporters were able to indulge in a little schadenfreude at the end too, after a calamitous defensive mix-up handed Callum Wilson the easiest goal he will ever score. It was a strange game in many ways, with Southampton enjoying 65% possession and registering 25 shots to Bournemouth\u2019s six, yet the only statistic that matters is the scoreline. Bournemouth also had a goal ruled out for offside after VAR intervened and a strong penalty appeal turned down despite the decision being reviewed. Technology was not on their side here but it did not need to be on a night when Southampton were such obliging opponents. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side were undone by a routine set-piece when Nathan Ak\u00e9 headed home almost unchallenged, and that poor concession set the tone for a flat first-half performance. Bournemouth, in contrast, looked dangerous whenever they counterattacked in that period and it says much for their character that they responded so well to seeing a superb goal for Joshua King chalked off. \u201cThat probably was the defining moment, how we would react to that setback,\u201d Eddie Howe, Bournemouth\u2019s manager, said. The goal that Harry Wilson scored 10 minutes later came at the end of a lovely move that prised open Southampton\u2019s right flank, and from that moment on it was hard to see a way back for the home team. James Ward-Prowse gave them some hope with a second-half penalty and there was plenty of pressure thereafter, yet the glaring absence of a cutting edge up front \u2013 Danny Ings and Che Adams have scored only once between them this season \u2013 raises major questions about where the goals will come from in this team. Bournemouth have no such concerns and there were wild scenes at the end as they celebrated a landmark victory. \u201cAt last,\u201d said Howe, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice feeling. Thankfully next time we come back that [sequence of games without a win] won\u2019t be the topic of conversation. It was a really nice moment for us all to enjoy together. When you consider how far this club has come in recent years and how bleak the outlook was at times, to think that we would win here in the Premier League \u2013 that\u2019s something that at one stage we would never have thought possible. So it\u2019s a nice moment to acknowledge that.\u201d The game was only 10 minutes old when Ak\u00e9 put Bournemouth ahead. Diego Rico delivered an inswinging corner and Ak\u00e9 was able to get a free run at the ball. Kevin Danso was the nearest player to Ak\u00e9 when the Dutchman made contact but powerless to prevent him from heading powerfully past Angus Gunn. Everyone in the stadium thought it was 2-0 when King expertly curled the ball into the far corner after running on to Dominic Solanke\u2019s threaded pass, but VAR correctly identified that the Norwegian had strayed just offside. If that was a warning for Southampton, it went unheeded. Philip Billing\u2019s break from deep implored King to release him in the inside-left channel, and it was a lovely cutback from the central midfielder that picked out the run of Harry Wilson. Darting across Jannik Vestergaard, the Welshman scored his third Bournemouth goal with an incisive first-time finish. \u201cHe\u2019s got that knack of popping up with big goals,\u201d added Howe. Hasenh\u00fcttl changed things around both tactically and in terms of personnel, and was rewarded with a goal early in the second half, when Ward-Prowse emphatically converted from the spot after Steve Cook had clumsily brought down Adams. Bournemouth were then denied a penalty when Chris Kavanagh, the referee, waved away their appeals and VAR decided against overturning that decision. It made for an anxious finale for Bournemouth until a total breakdown in communication between Gunn and Jan Bednarek gave Callum Wilson the chance to roll the ball into the net in front of the jubilant visiting supporters. \u201cThey were very clinical and we weren\u2019t,\u201d lamented Hasenh\u00fcttl.",

Jones begins his fourth World Cup campaign and his first with England against Tonga on Sunday and by his own admission he is a bundle of nerves. Excited too. And as shown by the tears that welled in his eyes, evidently proud at the ride he and his squad are about to embark on.</p> \n<p>This was not particularly like Jones, not when facing the press anyway. Temuera Morrison, the actor who plays Jones in the recently released film that retells Japan\u2019s miraculous victory over South Africa four years ago, has talked about perfecting the Australian\u2019s \u201cstink eye\u201d \u2013 the infamous stare that more often than not precedes a tongue-lashing. That is the sort of thing we have come to expect from England\u2019s head coach. But not on Friday. Asked what coaching England in Japan makes him feel, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, mate. It\u2019s a great honour to coach England ... and I just want to make sure I do my best.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/eddie-jones-cash-in-sponsorship-england-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Eddie Jones\u2019s popularity in Japan proves rewarding for England coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here was a glimpse of vulnerability from a coach for whom words such as driven, relentless and ruthless have become synonymous. \u201cI think World Cups are always emotional,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou get to do something that is pretty special. To coach a nation and to be responsible for a nation at a World Cup, where you know it\u2019s not just rugby fans watching. Families watch World Cups, that\u2019s the difference. It becomes an event for the country, rather than an event for rugby followers. It becomes an event for this country here. To be involved in that is a real honour. I\u2019m massively nervous and I\u2019m massively excited. If I didn\u2019t have that feeling, I\u2019d be a little bit worried.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t know. The one thing we don\u2019t control is the results of games. We control the preparation for the games and every coach \u2013 all 20 coaches out here \u2013 is having this conversation now. They all think they\u2019ve done a great job preparing their team, but we don\u2019t know, do we?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82609e12-8858-448a-816d-500f034cda19\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England: </b>E Daly, A Watson, M Tuilagi, O Farrell (captain), J May; G Ford, B Youngs; J Marler, J George, K Sinckler, C Lawes, M Itoje, T Curry, S Underhill, B Vunipola. <b>Reserves:</b> L Cowan-Dickie, E Genge, D Cole, G Kruis, L Ludlam, W Heinz, H Slade, J Joseph.</p>\n    <p><b>Tonga:</b> D Halaifonua, A Pakalani, S Piutau (captain), C Vuna, V Lolohea, K Morath, S Takulua; S \u2018Fisiihoi , S Sakalia, B Tameifuna, S Lousi, H Fifita, S Kalamafoni, Z Kapeli, M Vaipulu. <b>Reserves:</b> S Maile, L Talakai, M Fia, D Faleafa, N Manu, L Fukofuka, J Faiva, N Tu\u2019itavake.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jones went on to explain the sense of anticipation surrounding England\u2019s first match in Japan. After three months of meticulous planning England are now ready to take the field, or as Jones puts it: \u201cThe World Cup is like a rollercoaster. We are at the top of the ride now, we are looking down \u2013 everyone\u2019s nervous, everyone\u2019s excited. You get down the first slope, you are not sure if you are going to throw up or hang on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps the nervousness explains why Jones has named his strongest side available. He has publicly toyed with the idea that he may field a blend of senior players with some of the youngsters in his squad but he has instead gone all guns blazing. George Ford and Owen Farrell are paired at 10 and 12, with Manu Tuilagi outside them and Tom Curry dovetails with Sam Underhill in the back row.</p> \n<p>Both of those combinations were first tried in last month\u2019s record win over Ireland and, in total, 13 of the 15 who played that day have been selected with Courtney Lawes preferred over George Kruis for his athleticism and Anthony Watson coming on to the wing for Joe Cokanasiga, who has been hampered by a knee injury of late.</p> \n<p>On paper it looks like a team designed to go around Tonga rather than through them, but Jones added: \u201cWe want to take them on. We are England and we want to take them on up front so no one will come out of there guessing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tonga meanwhile, have named a side featuring seven England-based players. They are also coached by Toutai Kefu, who played under Jones for Australia in the early 2000s. \u201cWhen we are ferocious and direct that\u2019s when we play our best football,\u201d said Kefu. \u201cFor us to be at our best we need to play ferociously for a lot of the match. It is a massive challenge for us but we have got nothing to lose and we are going to throw everything at it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fef03be-90e4-4479-a966-6b06ac24f770\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Fixtures, tables and results</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/20/top-try-and-points-scorers-for-the-2019-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Top try and points scorers</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-stadium-guide\">Stadium guide</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-guide-to-the-referees\">Referee guide</a><br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Our latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute+sport/rugby-union\">minute-by-minute live reports</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\">Sign up to The Breakdown</a>, our free rugby union email newsletter</p>\n    <p><b>Team guides</b><br>Pool A: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-ireland-team-guide\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-japan-team-guide\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-russia-team-guide\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-samoa-team-guide\">Samoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-scotland-team-guide\">Scotland</a><br>Pool B: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-canada-team-guide\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-italy-team-guide\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-namibia-team-guide\">Namibia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-new-zealand-team-guide\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">South Africa</a><br>Pool C: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-argentina-team-guide\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">England</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-france-team-guide\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-team-guide\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-usa-team-guide\">USA</a><br>Pool D: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-team-guide\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fiji-team-guide\">Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-georgia-team-guide\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-uruguay-team-guide\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-wales-team-guide\">Wales</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It could be argued that England starting both of their fly-halves and openside flankers is unnecessary but to start the campaign Jones is leaving nothing to chance. \u201cGoing into your first game, you never know what it is going to be like,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone has prepared to win the World Cup.

Temuera Morrison, the actor who plays Jones in the recently released film that retells Japan\u2019s miraculous victory over South Africa four years ago, has talked about perfecting the Australian\u2019s \u201cstink eye\u201d \u2013 the infamous stare that more often than not precedes a tongue-lashing. That is the sort of thing we have come to expect from England\u2019s head coach. But not on Friday. Asked what coaching England in Japan makes him feel, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, mate. It\u2019s a great honour to coach England ... and I just want to make sure I do my best.\u201d Here was a glimpse of vulnerability from a coach for whom words such as driven, relentless and ruthless have become synonymous. \u201cI think World Cups are always emotional,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou get to do something that is pretty special. To coach a nation and to be responsible for a nation at a World Cup, where you know it\u2019s not just rugby fans watching. Families watch World Cups, that\u2019s the difference. It becomes an event for the country, rather than an event for rugby followers. It becomes an event for this country here. To be involved in that is a real honour. I\u2019m massively nervous and I\u2019m massively excited. If I didn\u2019t have that feeling, I\u2019d be a little bit worried. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know. The one thing we don\u2019t control is the results of games. We control the preparation for the games and every coach \u2013 all 20 coaches out here \u2013 is having this conversation now. They all think they\u2019ve done a great job preparing their team, but we don\u2019t know, do we?\u201d Jones went on to explain the sense of anticipation surrounding England\u2019s first match in Japan. After three months of meticulous planning England are now ready to take the field, or as Jones puts it: \u201cThe World Cup is like a rollercoaster. We are at the top of the ride now, we are looking down \u2013 everyone\u2019s nervous, everyone\u2019s excited. You get down the first slope, you are not sure if you are going to throw up or hang on.\u201d Perhaps the nervousness explains why Jones has named his strongest side available. He has publicly toyed with the idea that he may field a blend of senior players with some of the youngsters in his squad but he has instead gone all guns blazing. George Ford and Owen Farrell are paired at 10 and 12, with Manu Tuilagi outside them and Tom Curry dovetails with Sam Underhill in the back row. Both of those combinations were first tried in last month\u2019s record win over Ireland and, in total, 13 of the 15 who played that day have been selected with Courtney Lawes preferred over George Kruis for his athleticism and Anthony Watson coming on to the wing for Joe Cokanasiga, who has been hampered by a knee injury of late. On paper it looks like a team designed to go around Tonga rather than through them, but Jones added: \u201cWe want to take them on. We are England and we want to take them on up front so no one will come out of there guessing.\u201d Tonga meanwhile, have named a side featuring seven England-based players. They are also coached by Toutai Kefu, who played under Jones for Australia in the early 2000s. \u201cWhen we are ferocious and direct that\u2019s when we play our best football,\u201d said Kefu. \u201cFor us to be at our best we need to play ferociously for a lot of the match. It is a massive challenge for us but we have got nothing to lose and we are going to throw everything at it.\u201d It could be argued that England starting both of their fly-halves and openside flankers is unnecessary but to start the campaign Jones is leaving nothing to chance. \u201cGoing into your first game, you never know what it is going to be like,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone has prepared to win the World Cup. Everyone thinks they are prepared for it. Within the group, you are going to have players with varying degrees of adaptability and adjustment, and you have to try to help them get through it. You\u2019ve got to adapt to that and the players have equipped themselves to ride the rollercoaster because there\u2019s going to be some turns, there\u2019s going to be some accidents, there\u2019s going to be some fun. We want to enjoy all of those things that come along and the team\u2019s equipped to handle it.\u201d And Jones\u2019s message for the thousands of supporters who will fill the stadium? \u201cHang on to your seat. They\u2019re going to join us on the rollercoaster.\u201d",

Some victims were sexually assaulted while unconscious, the filing suggested.</p> <p>One victim said he had fallen asleep on Buck\u2019s couch and had been drugged while he was asleep, forcing him to go to the hospital the next day, where staff confirmed he had ingested a \u201ctar-like substance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBuck told Victim 5 that it was not gratifying for him if Victim 5 did not ingest methamphetamine,\u201d the complaint said.</p> <p>Another victim said he learned about Buck when he was homeless and living in a park, and said he was nicknamed \u201cDoctor Kevorkian\u201d, a reference to the pathologist known for helping terminally ill patients die. This victim said it was part of Buck\u2019s \u201crole-playing and fantasy to inject people with methamphetamine\u201d and that although the victim had never injected meth before, \u201cBuck assured him that it would be fine\u201d.</p> <p>Buck allegedly ignored this victim\u2019s agreement to only do a small dose and \u201cemptied an entire syringe in him\u201d.

That victim eventually escaped.</p> <p>In another case, Buck gave the victim what the victim thought was vodka, but he fell asleep after consuming it, the complaint said.

      "bodyText": "Ed Buck, the Los Angeles political activist accused of preying on gay black men and forcibly injecting them with fatal doses of drugs, had at least 10 victims, would drug them while they were unconscious and was known locally as \u201cDoctor Kevorkian\u201d, according to new court records. The wealthy Democratic donor, 65, was arrested this week and charged with running a drug den more than two years after 26-year-old Gemmel Moore fatally overdosed in Buck\u2019s West Hollywood home. On Thursday, federal prosecutors charged him with administering methamphetamine to a victim who died and released new details about how he targeted men struggling with homelessness and addiction. Black LGBT activists in California have been advocating for years for Buck to be brought to justice and have accused police of ignoring their concerns and allowing the politically connected activist to continue hurting people. Buck\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comment. Buck, whose arrest came after a third man overdosed in his home this month, would offer to pay his victims for sex, force them to do drugs, inject them directly, give them tranquilizers without telling them and take photos of them, the complaint said. Some victims were sexually assaulted while unconscious, the filing suggested. One victim said he had fallen asleep on Buck\u2019s couch and had been drugged while he was asleep, forcing him to go to the hospital the next day, where staff confirmed he had ingested a \u201ctar-like substance\u201d. \u201cBuck told Victim 5 that it was not gratifying for him if Victim 5 did not ingest methamphetamine,\u201d the complaint said. Another victim said he learned about Buck when he was homeless and living in a park, and said he was nicknamed \u201cDoctor Kevorkian\u201d, a reference to the pathologist known for helping terminally ill patients die. This victim said it was part of Buck\u2019s \u201crole-playing and fantasy to inject people with methamphetamine\u201d and that although the victim had never injected meth before, \u201cBuck assured him that it would be fine\u201d. Buck allegedly ignored this victim\u2019s agreement to only do a small dose and \u201cemptied an entire syringe in him\u201d. Another time Buck injected this person, he immediately lost consciousness and awoke to discover his anus bleeding and a third man filming him, the complaint said. Another victim said Buck injected him with a tranquilizer, making him \u201cunable to move\u201d, adding that when Buck later wanted the victim to leave his home, Buck \u201cbecame frustrated and obtained a power saw from a closet, turned it on, and approached [the] Victim with it\u201d. That victim eventually escaped. In another case, Buck gave the victim what the victim thought was vodka, but he fell asleep after consuming it, the complaint said. This victim said he woke up to Buck injecting him with a syringe and panicked because he did not use meth, but could not move when he tried to get up. He also felt \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d in his anus and when he tried to remove metal clips fastened to his nipples, Buck \u201claughed\u201d. This behavior continued after a second victim died in his home in January of 2019, authorities said. The most recent victim, who overdosed but survived, told authorities that Buck solicited him for sex and distributed meth to him \u201cnearly every day during an approximately one-month period\u201d. The shocking details published in federal court filings did not come as a surprise to local activists, who said they had conducted their own investigation and interviews and connected the victims to the authorities since police were failing to take the threat Buck posed seriously. \u201cHe has been allowed to do all of these things all of this time,\u201d said Nana Gyamfi, a civil rights lawyer representing Moore\u2019s family, adding that she wanted to see the Los Angeles county district attorney, Jackie Lacey, file murder charges. \u201cI knew that this day was going to come and we were going to get justice for my son,\u201d Moore\u2019s mother, LaTisha Nixon, said in a statement late Thursday night, adding that all she ever wanted was for the Lacey to \u201cdo her job\u201d. The family of Timothy Dean, the other man who died in Buck\u2019s home, said in a statement Friday that local law enforcement \u201cfailed our brother and Gemmel Moore in every possible way\u201d, adding: \u201cThe evidence was there long ago before now.

      "bodyText": "Labour has been plunged into a fresh civil war on the eve of its annual conference, as allies of Jeremy Corbyn launched a bid to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post of deputy leader. Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum, tabled a last-minute motion at the party\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) on Friday night calling for Watson\u2019s job to be scrapped. A Momentum source said: \u201cNo one person is more important than beating Boris Johnson, ending austerity and tackling the climate emergency. We just can\u2019t afford to go into an election with a deputy leader set on wrecking Labour\u2019s chances. \u201cLabour members overwhelmingly want a deputy leadership election, but our outdated rulebook won\u2019t let it happen. You need 20% of Labour MPs to trigger an election, and they just won\u2019t let the members have a fair and open election.\u201d The chair of the NEC ruled Lansman\u2019s motion out of order, but he then sought to have that decision overturned. Lansman won the subsequent vote 17-10; but that fell just short of the two-thirds majority necessary to challenge the chair\u2019s authority. However, the Guardian understands NEC members agreed to return to the issue at Saturday\u2019s meeting. If the policy is agreed, it would be recommended to Labour members as a change to party rules, which would then have to be approved by conference. Neither Watson nor Corbyn were present at the meeting. A senior Labour source said: \u201cTom had given his apologies to the NEC as he had to look after his children. \u201cUsually when you disagree within parties on issues like taking a remain stance on Brexit, you have a debate. Seems that in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party they\u2019d rather abolish you than debate with you.\u201d A spokesperson for Corbyn declined to comment. Watson, the MP for West Bromwich East, was elected to the post of deputy leader in 2015. Never an enthusiastic Corbyn supporter, he has increasingly irked the leadership in recent months. He formed an internal Labour caucus called the Future Britain Group, in the wake of the defections of a string of MPs, including Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, calling for the voices of social democrats to be heard more loudly in the party. And most recently he has made a series of off-message interventions in the Brexit debate, including most recently giving a speech calling for Labour to support a referendum before a general election. Some Labour MPs expressed alarm about the surprise move to oust the deputy leader. Jess Phillips warned of what she called \u201ca desperate attempt to control and expel anyone who has an independent thought\u201d. Ilford North MP Wes Streeting tweeted: Corbyn allies believe Watson is using the issue of Brexit to drive a wedge between the Labour leader and the party\u2019s overwhelmingly pro-remain activists. In his speech earlier this month, Watson said his party must \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d \u2013 something Corbyn has reiterated in recent days he believes is the wrong approach. As well as irritating the leadership, Watson has had a long-running feud with Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, Labour\u2019s biggest donor. The pair were once close friends, but have clashed over Corbyn\u2019s leadership and Brexit. In May, as Watson became increasingly vocal about the party\u2019s Brexit policy, McCluskey said: \u201cTom Watson\u2019s already out, surprise surprise, trying to take on the role of Prince Machiavelli, but I\u2019ve got news for Tom. Machiavelli was effective. He\u2019s a poor imitation of that. If he\u2019s trying to turn Labour members against Corbyn and in his favour, then he\u2019s going to lose disastrously. \u201cAnd there will be others in the coming days who try and do the same.

The NEC discussed a bid to create a second, female deputy leader role at last year\u2019s conference, but it was withdrawn at the last minute after Watson himself welcomed the move. Friday\u2019s move to oust Watson, which several senior Labour sources suggested would not have been taken without Corbyn\u2019s tacit backing, follows the abolition of Labour Students, the group some party left-wingers have long regarded as a hotbed of centrists.",

The car is at the Toyota dealer and they have no ETA [estimated time of arrival] on when the part will be available to fit. They have three other cars with the same problem.\u201d Another driver said their insurance company had told them it could be three months to source a replacement, while one said a garage in Yeovil had been unable to tell them when it would be available. In many instances thieves have operated in broad daylight, with some instances caught on camera. Ironically, the increase in cost of the metals has been driven by their use in catalytic converters, with the automotive industry accounting for about 85% of demand for rhodium and palladium. James Clark, senior press relations manager at Toyota UK, said such thefts were not limited to the company\u2019s products, but added: \u201cThe recent rise in the value of such parts for recycling has meant that police forces have seen a very significant rise in these offences in the last few months. \u201cThis sudden rise is one we could not have envisaged set against many years of low incidents of theft. This has impacted our ability to source enough of the parts we need in some cases, for which we sincerely apologise; but we are taking urgent action to address this with our suppliers.\u2019 He said the company had posted guidance online for customers and sought to contact them, in some cases through dealers. It has also introduced a \u201ccatloc\u201d device, to help defer theft, at a reduced price, sought to minimise the cost of replacement and its French supplier has increased production.",

Monetary policy is far less effective at stimulating the economy than it was pre-GFC. The two decades before the GFC saw sustained economic growth, increased living standards and relative economic stability, producing an environment in which households increased consumption and took on more debt.</p> <p>Since the GFC, high levels of household debt, particularly for housing, combined with stagnant wage growth and a <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/why-we-re-feeling-poor-prices-for-schools-health-and-other-needs-up-about-200pc-in-20-years-20190722-p529in.html\">disproportionate increase</a> in the cost of non-discretionary spending \u2013 far in excess of either CPI or wage growth \u2013 has crushed consumer confidence, meaning that even with interest rates at record lows, people are less willing to take on debt or reduce saving; they are focused on paying down existing debt and meeting the increased costs of living. Therefore, repeated interest rate cuts by the RBA are being met with a very muted response from consumers.</p> <p>Monetary policy is meant to stabilise immediate economic settings; what we are seeing now is long-term, structural weakness in the economy, which has been exacerbated by the contractionary force of fiscal policies over more than five years. Stagnant wage growth is due to a deliberate reduction in bargaining power for workers, the government\u2019s policies to restrict wage growth in the public sector, a lack of investment in infrastructure and moribund industry policy settings. That the government is pursuing a surplus in this environment is counter-productive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6a64fc7e2bbdf783c28aadaac6ed486beb9ffefc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a64fc7e2bbdf783c28aadaac6ed486beb9ffefc/0_0_250_240/250.jpg\" alt=\"Brendan Coates\" width=\"250\" height=\"240\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendan Coates</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Coates</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Brendan Coates is program director for household finances at the Grattan Institute.</em></p> <p><strong>Brendan</strong>: I agree with Stephen that the RBA should continue to be held responsible for hitting its inflation target, and it has been <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ZacGross/the-high-cost-of-low-inflation-88cb449b4687\">failing to do so</a> for an extended period. After all, the US unemployment rate has a three in front of it. Ours has a five in front of it, and is rising. The difference between 3% and 5% unemployment is hundreds of thousands of people who are not in work, slowing economic growth and hurting the budget balance. The RBA\u2019s monetary policy choices account for a significant share of that difference. Our unemployment rate is higher than it could or should be because monetary policy has been too tight.</p> <p>But there are reasons to think that as the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy rate inches closer and closer to zero, the benefit from further cuts gets smaller and the cost gets larger (although the evidence is not as <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2017/borio-hofmann.html\">clear</a> as we\u2019d like it to be).

Has the RBA lost credibility? Should the target be lowered?</strong></p> <p><strong>Brendan</strong>: The big problem here is expectations: if the Reserve Bank repeatedly misses the target, and also publicly claims (as Lowe <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-05-21.html\">has</a>) that monetary policy isn\u2019t going to work, then you entrench expectations for low inflation (and even deflation). And while there are not that many rate cuts left in the arsenal, there are other tools the Reserve Bank can use. In particular, there\u2019s certainly plenty of scope to use so-called unconventional monetary policy to stoke inflation and ensure the RBA hits its inflation target, ultimately boosting economic growth and lowering unemployment below 5%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By choosing to undershoot the inflation target, the RBA has damaged the credibility not just of the target, but monetary policy itself</p> <footer> <cite>Stephen Kirchner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lowering the target would be a big mistake: a lower inflation target, such as 1-2% (rather than the 2-3% band we have currently) would suggest we should soon be <em>raising</em> interest rates, slowing the economy down even further from where we are today. After all, the RBA\u2019s preferred measure of inflation is currently running at 1.6%. The central question in the monetary policy debate <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/alternatives-to-the-feds-2-percent-inflation-target/\">abroad</a> is whether the inflation target should be lifted, rather than lowered.

Unemployment rates in comparable OECD nations have been well below Australia\u2019s for well over two years, without causing break-outs in wages or inflation.</p> <p>Both Brendan and Stephen are right to point out that the tightness in monetary policy over the last three years is, in part, due to the emphasis on financial stability in the mandate agreed with the treasurer after the 2016 election. I agree that recent comments from the treasurer that the mandate will be revised to reinstate the primacy of the inflation target are encouraging; it\u2019s critical that the new agreement be settled ASAP.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not a lack of ammunition that\u2019s holding the RBA back, but an unwillingness to use that ammunition</p> <footer> <cite>Brendan Coates</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the RBA has <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/monetary-policy/rba-board-minutes/2019/2019-08-06.html\">flirted</a> with the use of unconventional monetary policy to stimulate growth, it remains reluctant to do so, in line with its historical reliance on interest rates alone. The RBA could certainly be less conservative in its approach to monetary policy.</p> <p>I don\u2019t agree that the RBA\u2019s failure to hit its inflation target has damaged its credibility; most observers recognise the challenges presented by a global downturn in wage growth and historically low inflation.

It can also be deployed in ways that enhance the productive potential of the economy. But this contribution is independent of demand management.</p> <p>With a floating exchange rate and an independent inflation-targeting central bank, fiscal policy is irrelevant to demand management. A fiscal expansion would only lead to capital inflows, an appreciation of the exchange rate and crowding-out of net exports. Moreover, if the RBA were doing its job and inflation were target-consistent, it would have to offset anything the government might do with fiscal policy that moved inflation away from target.</p> <p>The treasurer should not try to do Lowe\u2019s job for him.</p> <p><strong>Brendan</strong>: As Stephen notes, there\u2019s good evidence that monetary policy is still effective, even if it\u2019s perhaps a little less effective than otherwise as we approach the zero lower bound. It\u2019s not a lack of ammunition that\u2019s holding the RBA back, but an unwillingness to use that ammunition to achieve that part of the bank\u2019s mandate.</p> <p>But I disagree with Stephen that fiscal policy should <em>never</em> be used for demand management, or that it can\u2019t be effective, especially if the economic outlook becomes particularly dire. David Gruen, then deputy secretary at the Treasury (and formerly with the RBA) <a href=\"https://treasury.gov.au/speech/the-return-of-fiscal-policy\">made the case for short-term fiscal stimulus</a> as demand management in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that the government is making the Reserve Bank\u2019s job harder. If we have to choose between going down the route of unconventional monetary policy, or shifting fiscal policy a little, it\u2019s not clear to me why we\u2019d just want to rely solely on the former and not at all on the latter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f384213513dd49ad63a95bbe03938f721de1537\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f384213513dd49ad63a95bbe03938f721de1537/0_277_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House under construction\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Building social housing would be an effective stimulus with a solid policy rationale, argues Brendan Coates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Miller/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the big pitfall with fiscal policy is timing. Whereas the case to act quickly was unambiguous during the global financial crisis, it\u2019s quite a bit harder today. Most indicators are pointing to a slowing economy, and some are looking pretty bleak, but none clearly signal we\u2019re at crisis levels yet. So it\u2019s more a case of the government standing ready to act with fiscal stimulus, if it needs to.</p> <p>Lowe\u2019s calls for infrastructure spending are problematic: good quality infrastructure projects take time to plan and deliver, which means any infrastructure stimulus typically arrives too late to help, as it did after the early 1990s recession. The best fiscal stimulus policies are temporary, fast to roll out and involve \u201cno regrets\u201d \u2013 in other words, spending with a solid policy rationale, as I\u2019ve argued <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/news/the-treasurer-should-be-planning-economic-stimulus-now/\">here</a>. If the government needs to act, it would be better to focus on building social housing, which would provide effective and targeted support to the construction sector when the <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/property/2019/08/05/rent-increases-undersupply-population-growth/\">pipeline</a> is at risk of drying up, while addressing an important social <a href=\"https://blog.grattan.edu.au/2019/06/who-is-homeless-in-australia/\">problem</a>, and boost Newstart, which is clearly too low today.</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> There is a clear case for more expansionary fiscal policy now, if not yesterday. Like Brendan, I disagree that fiscal policy shouldn\u2019t be used to stimulate demand; there are strong precedents, both here and internationally, for short-term fiscal stimulus to stoke demand during economic downturns, and we are certainly seeing a downturn in Australia today.</p> <p>While Brendan is correct to say that the conventional indicators of a recession are not present in the Australian economy, there is merit to the argument that those indicators are no longer fit for purpose given the structural changes to the labour market, including the rate of underutilisation, the consistent reduction in the share of profits going to labour and the lack of business investment since the GFC. While I agree that we need urgently to boost our stocks of social housing, a government program to do so would take even longer than bringing forward already agreed infrastructure projects, as it would necessarily involve Coag agreement and the procurement of land.</p> <p>Rather, the government should legislate four quick measures to inject funds into low- and middle-income households:</p> <ol> <li><p>Immediately increase the rate of Newstart by at least $75 per week;</p></li> <li><p>Bring forward stage two of the tax cuts legislated in July;</p></li> <li><p>Legislate to reverse the cuts to penalty rates across all awards;</p></li> <li><p>Abolish the cap on APS salaries and provide pay rises of at least 3% to federal employees.</p></li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58b57746eb57421ef74cf430956e9943e719e6f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58b57746eb57421ef74cf430956e9943e719e6f6/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"$50 Australian notes being printed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some economists have suggested people\u2019s QE, or quantitive easing where money is credited straight into bank accounts to help meet inflation goals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RBA/PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Greg: The talk, on the back of NAB\u2019s advice this week, has quickly shifted to a cash rate falling to around 0.25% and even the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/what-is-quantitative-easing\">quantitative easing</a> \u2013 something the RBA has said in responses to <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Economics/RBAReview2018/Documents\">questions </a></strong><strong> \u201cis unlikely\u201d</strong><strong>.

Monetary policy begins to work straightaway, not least via a lower exchange rate, which is the Australian economy\u2019s most important shock absorber.</p> <p>The RBA should transition to QE as soon as the level of the cash rate becomes a constraint on its ability to meet its mandate. We are not there yet, but very close. Since inflation is below target, the RBA has little to lose by acting quickly and decisively.

This would work, but perhaps too well. It would break down the institutional separation between monetary and fiscal policy. Once that divide is breached, it will be very hard to put back together.</p> <p><strong>Emma</strong>: For reasons outlined in my response to question one, I don\u2019t believe further cuts to interest rates will be sufficient to stoke demand. Having said that, if the RBA did elect to engage in QE, then I am in that camp that prefers a \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what Stephen means by it \u201cworking too well\u201d, or why that would be a problem. A stimulus provided directly to households rather than through financial markets is what\u2019s needed now. Effectively, a people\u2019s QE would be faster and more effective, as it could target low and middle-income earners, put cash directly into the pockets of people likely to spend it immediately, thereby lifting the retail sector, and overcome the obvious reluctance of households to take on more debt.</p> <p>But the obvious riposte to that is that this kind of stimulus is best delivered by government as a package of fiscal measures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/wealth-inequality-reasons-richest-global-gap\">Wealth inequality is soaring \u2013 here are the 10 reasons why it\u2019s happening | Dominic Frisby</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Brendan</strong>: The RBA\u2019s responses to the House economics committee suggesting QE and other unconventional monetary is \u201cunlikely\u201d to be needed jar with an increasingly weak Australian economy, of which the NAB survey is simply the latest sign.

Given that evidence, with the RBA following the approach of the US Fed and others in buying up government and other bonds (adjusted to Australian markets, as Stephen outlined), there\u2019s little reason to go with something more dramatic such as a \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d option.</p> <p><strong>Greg: How do you think the RBA measures up to other central banks when it comes to transparency and accountability?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stephen:</strong> The RBA dramatically improved its transparency under Glenn Stevens. A more important issue is how effectively it uses its transparency mechanisms. The effective stance of monetary policy is determined more by interest rate expectations than the actual cash rate. The RBA is often reluctant to signal an explicit policy bias, which means it is underutilising the expectations channel.</p> <p>Accountability is a bigger issue. The RBA is internationally anomalous in not separating the governance of the bank and the setting of monetary policy, placing the board in the position of overseeing itself on monetary policy. In the US, monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, which is separate from the Fed board, although has overlapping membership.</p> <p>As I argue in this <a href=\"http://www.institutional-economics.com/images/uploads/ANewErafortheRBA.pdf\">article</a>, the RBA has all but conceded that the external board members are conflicted in their role as setters of monetary policy. This is why the contributions of individual board members are suppressed in the minutes.</p> <p>The board should not set monetary policy. This function should be given to a monetary policy committee made up of RBA executives and external academic appointees with expertise in monetary policy. The governor\u2019s performance-based remuneration should also be tied to inflation outcomes by the board.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/10/turmoil-stock-markets-10-years-cheap-money-ends\">Test of nerve for markets as 10 years of cheap money come to an end</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Emma:</strong> As Stephen notes, the RBA has significantly improved its transparency and accountability since the changes <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/monetary-policy/framework/stmt-conduct-mp-4-06122007.html\">announced</a> in December 2007, and it is now on par with the central banks of comparable OECD nations such as Canada and the US, and the European Union. Notably, the decision of then-governor Glenn Stevens to immediately release the minutes of the RBA\u2019s monthly board meetings brought it into line with best practice by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear to me what a press conference after the monthly release of the board minutes would add to the information already available to the media and the public through current arrangements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is still much more the Reserve Bank could do to improve transparency and accountability</p> <footer> <cite>Brendan Coates</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am sceptical of accountability measures that would tie the governor\u2019s reappointment or remuneration to the achievement of specific outcomes, whether enforced by the board or the treasurer.</p> <p>We should be wary of introducing more prescriptive measures that may undermine the perceived or actual independence of the RBA, which remains one of our most trusted public bodies at a time of declining confidence in the institutions of democracy both here and internationally.</p> <p><strong>Brendan</strong>: While there\u2019s been some progress, there is still much more the Reserve Bank could do to improve transparency and accountability. It lags well behind the approaches adopted by central banks abroad in several important dimensions. For example, the governor of the US Federal Reserve holds a <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20190130.pdf\">press conference</a> after each monetary policy committee meeting. The treasurer could even consider an arrangement like the British government has with the Bank of England: when inflation figures are released that are outside the target range, the governor must write a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/boe-asked-to-explain-inflation-target-misses-sooner-in-letters\">public letter</a> to the parliament that acknowledges this and explains the reasons for this deviation.</p> <p>I agree with Stephen that the lack of external expertise on the RBA board is a problem: you only have to look at the <a href=\"https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/committees/commrep/eea5d0b8-72e9-4b5e-acf8-52ed46888ced/toc_pdf/Standing%20Committee%20on%20Economics_2019_08_09_7100_Official.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22committees/commrep/eea5d0b8-72e9-4b5e-acf8-52ed46888ced/0000%22\">grilling</a> that Lowe received from federal Labor MP (and Harvard-trained PhD economist) Andrew Leigh at the House economics committee hearing recently for systemically missing the inflation target to see what a robust and informed discussion could bring to the table. It\u2019s hard to imagine RBA board members without that degree of expertise being able to push back on the RBA staff view. But like Emma, I don\u2019t agree with Stephen that remuneration should be tied to inflation outcomes set by the board.</p>",

There are two policy arms of the economy \u2013 fiscal and monetary. The government controls the fiscal side through spending and taxes; the Reserve Bank controls the monetary side. The RBA has already cut the cash rate twice this year, to a record low of 1%. But with inflation growth still below the 2%-3% target the question is whether the bank is doing enough, or whether the government needs to do more. We asked three experts on the economy \u2013 Stephen Kirchner from the United States Studies Centre, Brendan Coates from the Grattan Institute, and Emma Dawson from Per Capita \u2013 to discuss these questions. Greg: Is the RBA right to call for greater fiscal intervention by the government, and are we at a point where monetary policy is less powerful than it was in the past? Dr Stephen Kirchner is director of the trade and investment program at the United States Studies Centre, University of Sydney. Stephen: Governor [Philip] Lowe would be on stronger ground asking for help from other arms of policy if the RBA was pulling its own weight, but it is not. The persistent undershooting of the inflation target is a deliberate policy choice the RBA has made that has left the unemployment rate around 0.7 percentage points higher than it should be, even on its own estimates. The case Lowe has made for spending on infrastructure and other policies to enhance productivity is independent of the economic cycle and would be no less important in a boom than in an emerging downturn. He is conflating long-term structural policy measures with short-term demand management. Lowe is trying to shirk responsibility and deflect blame for underperforming his mandate. Chris Kent recently showed monetary policy transmission is as powerful as ever. The point of having a floating exchange rate and an inflation-targeting central bank is that fiscal policy does not have to worry about short-term demand management. Emma Dawson is the executive director of Per Capita. Emma: Yes, and yes. Monetary policy is far less effective at stimulating the economy than it was pre-GFC. The two decades before the GFC saw sustained economic growth, increased living standards and relative economic stability, producing an environment in which households increased consumption and took on more debt. Since the GFC, high levels of household debt, particularly for housing, combined with stagnant wage growth and a disproportionate increase in the cost of non-discretionary spending \u2013 far in excess of either CPI or wage growth \u2013 has crushed consumer confidence, meaning that even with interest rates at record lows, people are less willing to take on debt or reduce saving; they are focused on paying down existing debt and meeting the increased costs of living. Therefore, repeated interest rate cuts by the RBA are being met with a very muted response from consumers. Monetary policy is meant to stabilise immediate economic settings; what we are seeing now is long-term, structural weakness in the economy, which has been exacerbated by the contractionary force of fiscal policies over more than five years. Stagnant wage growth is due to a deliberate reduction in bargaining power for workers, the government\u2019s policies to restrict wage growth in the public sector, a lack of investment in infrastructure and moribund industry policy settings. That the government is pursuing a surplus in this environment is counter-productive. Brendan Coates is program director for household finances at the Grattan Institute. Brendan: I agree with Stephen that the RBA should continue to be held responsible for hitting its inflation target, and it has been failing to do so for an extended period. After all, the US unemployment rate has a three in front of it. Ours has a five in front of it, and is rising. The difference between 3% and 5% unemployment is hundreds of thousands of people who are not in work, slowing economic growth and hurting the budget balance. The RBA\u2019s monetary policy choices account for a significant share of that difference. Our unemployment rate is higher than it could or should be because monetary policy has been too tight. But there are reasons to think that as the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy rate inches closer and closer to zero, the benefit from further cuts gets smaller and the cost gets larger (although the evidence is not as clear as we\u2019d like it to be). Now is not a time for fiscal and monetary policy to be pulling in different directions. Greg: What are the consequences of the Reserve Bank missing its inflation target? Has the RBA lost credibility? Should the target be lowered? Brendan: The big problem here is expectations: if the Reserve Bank repeatedly misses the target, and also publicly claims (as Lowe has) that monetary policy isn\u2019t going to work, then you entrench expectations for low inflation (and even deflation). And while there are not that many rate cuts left in the arsenal, there are other tools the Reserve Bank can use. In particular, there\u2019s certainly plenty of scope to use so-called unconventional monetary policy to stoke inflation and ensure the RBA hits its inflation target, ultimately boosting economic growth and lowering unemployment below 5%. Lowering the target would be a big mistake: a lower inflation target, such as 1-2% (rather than the 2-3% band we have currently) would suggest we should soon be raising interest rates, slowing the economy down even further from where we are today. After all, the RBA\u2019s preferred measure of inflation is currently running at 1.6%. The central question in the monetary policy debate abroad is whether the inflation target should be lifted, rather than lowered. Instead there is a clear need to strengthen the focus on the RBA hitting its current inflation target. If the bank wants to achieve two objectives, it needs two policy instruments. Fortunately, it has them: monetary policy for inflation, and macro-prudential policy in concert with Australian Prudential and Regulatory Authority (Apra) for financial stability. Recent comments from the treasurer signalling that the mandate to the RBA will be revised to \u201cstrengthen that target to ensure that we continue to see inflation where the Reserve Bank and the government want it to be\u201d are a promising sign. Stephen: By choosing to undershoot the inflation target, the RBA has damaged the credibility not just of the target, but monetary policy itself. Some commentators have suggested the target needs to be revised lower. But moving the goal posts would fail to hold the RBA accountable for delivering on its mandate. The actual target range is less important than having the RBA deliver the inflation outcomes people expect. As Brendan notes, the debate in the US has been almost exclusively about raising the target, even though the Fed has also undershot its 2% goal. Inflation expectations implied by the Australian bond market have collapsed. Financial markets no longer believe the RBA is committed to the inflation target. There are three things Josh Frydenberg can do: Reinstate the Labor party\u2019s 2010 agreement that subordinated the financial stability objective to the inflation target; Have Lowe front a press conference after each CPI release to explain the outcome and underscore the RBA\u2019s ownership of inflation; Make Lowe\u2019s reappointment conditional on inflation averaging between 2-3% over the remainder of his term. Emma: I agree that monetary policy has been too tight and that this is partly responsible for our relatively high unemployment rate; when the RBA itself has clearly stated that the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is really closer to 4%, the RBA\u2019s tardiness in cutting interest rates is difficult to understand. Unemployment rates in comparable OECD nations have been well below Australia\u2019s for well over two years, without causing break-outs in wages or inflation. Both Brendan and Stephen are right to point out that the tightness in monetary policy over the last three years is, in part, due to the emphasis on financial stability in the mandate agreed with the treasurer after the 2016 election. I agree that recent comments from the treasurer that the mandate will be revised to reinstate the primacy of the inflation target are encouraging; it\u2019s critical that the new agreement be settled ASAP. While the RBA has flirted with the use of unconventional monetary policy to stimulate growth, it remains reluctant to do so, in line with its historical reliance on interest rates alone. The RBA could certainly be less conservative in its approach to monetary policy. I don\u2019t agree that the RBA\u2019s failure to hit its inflation target has damaged its credibility; most observers recognise the challenges presented by a global downturn in wage growth and historically low inflation. The critical issue is for monetary and fiscal policy to pull in the same direction. What responsibility should the government take for the reduced growth in demand and the undershooting of the inflation target? Is this a sign that fiscal policy should become more expansionary? Stephen: Fiscal policy is a powerful tool for creating incentives (or disincentives!) to work, save and invest. It can also be deployed in ways that enhance the productive potential of the economy. But this contribution is independent of demand management. With a floating exchange rate and an independent inflation-targeting central bank, fiscal policy is irrelevant to demand management. A fiscal expansion would only lead to capital inflows, an appreciation of the exchange rate and crowding-out of net exports. Moreover, if the RBA were doing its job and inflation were target-consistent, it would have to offset anything the government might do with fiscal policy that moved inflation away from target. The treasurer should not try to do Lowe\u2019s job for him. Brendan: As Stephen notes, there\u2019s good evidence that monetary policy is still effective, even if it\u2019s perhaps a little less effective than otherwise as we approach the zero lower bound. It\u2019s not a lack of ammunition that\u2019s holding the RBA back, but an unwillingness to use that ammunition to achieve that part of the bank\u2019s mandate. But I disagree with Stephen that fiscal policy should never be used for demand management, or that it can\u2019t be effective, especially if the economic outlook becomes particularly dire. David Gruen, then deputy secretary at the Treasury (and formerly with the RBA) made the case for short-term fiscal stimulus as demand management in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It\u2019s clear that the government is making the Reserve Bank\u2019s job harder. If we have to choose between going down the route of unconventional monetary policy, or shifting fiscal policy a little, it\u2019s not clear to me why we\u2019d just want to rely solely on the former and not at all on the latter. But the big pitfall with fiscal policy is timing. Whereas the case to act quickly was unambiguous during the global financial crisis, it\u2019s quite a bit harder today. Most indicators are pointing to a slowing economy, and some are looking pretty bleak, but none clearly signal we\u2019re at crisis levels yet. So it\u2019s more a case of the government standing ready to act with fiscal stimulus, if it needs to. Lowe\u2019s calls for infrastructure spending are problematic: good quality infrastructure projects take time to plan and deliver, which means any infrastructure stimulus typically arrives too late to help, as it did after the early 1990s recession. The best fiscal stimulus policies are temporary, fast to roll out and involve \u201cno regrets\u201d \u2013 in other words, spending with a solid policy rationale, as I\u2019ve argued here. If the government needs to act, it would be better to focus on building social housing, which would provide effective and targeted support to the construction sector when the pipeline is at risk of drying up, while addressing an important social problem, and boost Newstart, which is clearly too low today. Emma: There is a clear case for more expansionary fiscal policy now, if not yesterday. Like Brendan, I disagree that fiscal policy shouldn\u2019t be used to stimulate demand; there are strong precedents, both here and internationally, for short-term fiscal stimulus to stoke demand during economic downturns, and we are certainly seeing a downturn in Australia today. While Brendan is correct to say that the conventional indicators of a recession are not present in the Australian economy, there is merit to the argument that those indicators are no longer fit for purpose given the structural changes to the labour market, including the rate of underutilisation, the consistent reduction in the share of profits going to labour and the lack of business investment since the GFC. While I agree that we need urgently to boost our stocks of social housing, a government program to do so would take even longer than bringing forward already agreed infrastructure projects, as it would necessarily involve Coag agreement and the procurement of land. Rather, the government should legislate four quick measures to inject funds into low- and middle-income households: Immediately increase the rate of Newstart by at least $75 per week; Bring forward stage two of the tax cuts legislated in July; Legislate to reverse the cuts to penalty rates across all awards; Abolish the cap on APS salaries and provide pay rises of at least 3% to federal employees. Greg: The talk, on the back of NAB\u2019s advice this week, has quickly shifted to a cash rate falling to around 0.25% and even the use of quantitative easing \u2013 something the RBA has said in responses to questions \u201cis unlikely\u201d. Do you share the bank\u2019s confidence that further cuts to the cash rate alone will do the job? What are your thoughts on the more unorthodox monetary policy measures such as QE? Stephen: Lowering the cash rate is the most effective way to respond to the emerging global downturn. Monetary policy begins to work straightaway, not least via a lower exchange rate, which is the Australian economy\u2019s most important shock absorber. The RBA should transition to QE as soon as the level of the cash rate becomes a constraint on its ability to meet its mandate. We are not there yet, but very close. Since inflation is below target, the RBA has little to lose by acting quickly and decisively. Unlike fiscal policy, changes in monetary policy can also be unwound very quickly. The RBA should purchase debt securities to lower interest rates across the yield curve, as well as credit spreads and the exchange rate. More targeted measures could also be used to address points of friction in the transmission to retail lending rates. Some have suggested so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s QE,\u201d where the central bank directly finances fiscal transfers to households. This would work, but perhaps too well. It would break down the institutional separation between monetary and fiscal policy. Once that divide is breached, it will be very hard to put back together. Emma: For reasons outlined in my response to question one, I don\u2019t believe further cuts to interest rates will be sufficient to stoke demand. Having said that, if the RBA did elect to engage in QE, then I am in that camp that prefers a \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what Stephen means by it \u201cworking too well\u201d, or why that would be a problem. A stimulus provided directly to households rather than through financial markets is what\u2019s needed now. Effectively, a people\u2019s QE would be faster and more effective, as it could target low and middle-income earners, put cash directly into the pockets of people likely to spend it immediately, thereby lifting the retail sector, and overcome the obvious reluctance of households to take on more debt. But the obvious riposte to that is that this kind of stimulus is best delivered by government as a package of fiscal measures. Brendan: The RBA\u2019s responses to the House economics committee suggesting QE and other unconventional monetary is \u201cunlikely\u201d to be needed jar with an increasingly weak Australian economy, of which the NAB survey is simply the latest sign. There\u2019s a good probability that more stimulus will be needed than the remaining interest rate cuts available and the RBA should stand ready to use unconventional monetary policy if required. Various estimates suggest QE in the United States lowered long-term interest rates by about 150 basis points. Given that evidence, with the RBA following the approach of the US Fed and others in buying up government and other bonds (adjusted to Australian markets, as Stephen outlined), there\u2019s little reason to go with something more dramatic such as a \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d option. Greg: How do you think the RBA measures up to other central banks when it comes to transparency and accountability? Stephen: The RBA dramatically improved its transparency under Glenn Stevens. A more important issue is how effectively it uses its transparency mechanisms. The effective stance of monetary policy is determined more by interest rate expectations than the actual cash rate. The RBA is often reluctant to signal an explicit policy bias, which means it is underutilising the expectations channel. Accountability is a bigger issue. The RBA is internationally anomalous in not separating the governance of the bank and the setting of monetary policy, placing the board in the position of overseeing itself on monetary policy. In the US, monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, which is separate from the Fed board, although has overlapping membership. As I argue in this article, the RBA has all but conceded that the external board members are conflicted in their role as setters of monetary policy. This is why the contributions of individual board members are suppressed in the minutes. The board should not set monetary policy. This function should be given to a monetary policy committee made up of RBA executives and external academic appointees with expertise in monetary policy. The governor\u2019s performance-based remuneration should also be tied to inflation outcomes by the board. Emma: As Stephen notes, the RBA has significantly improved its transparency and accountability since the changes announced in December 2007, and it is now on par with the central banks of comparable OECD nations such as Canada and the US, and the European Union. Notably, the decision of then-governor Glenn Stevens to immediately release the minutes of the RBA\u2019s monthly board meetings brought it into line with best practice by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. It\u2019s unclear to me what a press conference after the monthly release of the board minutes would add to the information already available to the media and the public through current arrangements. I am sceptical of accountability measures that would tie the governor\u2019s reappointment or remuneration to the achievement of specific outcomes, whether enforced by the board or the treasurer. We should be wary of introducing more prescriptive measures that may undermine the perceived or actual independence of the RBA, which remains one of our most trusted public bodies at a time of declining confidence in the institutions of democracy both here and internationally. Brendan: While there\u2019s been some progress, there is still much more the Reserve Bank could do to improve transparency and accountability. It lags well behind the approaches adopted by central banks abroad in several important dimensions. For example, the governor of the US Federal Reserve holds a press conference after each monetary policy committee meeting. The treasurer could even consider an arrangement like the British government has with the Bank of England: when inflation figures are released that are outside the target range, the governor must write a public letter to the parliament that acknowledges this and explains the reasons for this deviation. I agree with Stephen that the lack of external expertise on the RBA board is a problem: you only have to look at the grilling that Lowe received from federal Labor MP (and Harvard-trained PhD economist) Andrew Leigh at the House economics committee hearing recently for systemically missing the inflation target to see what a robust and informed discussion could bring to the table. It\u2019s hard to imagine RBA board members without that degree of expertise being able to push back on the RBA staff view. But like Emma, I don\u2019t agree with Stephen that remuneration should be tied to inflation outcomes set by the board.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has urged the joint standing committee on electoral matters to investigate whether the digital behemoths are having a negative impact on Australian democracy after Facebook refused to take down fake news about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d circulating during the May election. The ALP has used its post-election submission to the committee \u2013 which investigates the conduct of the contest after every federal election \u2013 to call for an examination of whether Australian elections are vulnerable to influence by \u201cmalinformation\u201d \u2013 a term invoked by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in its landmark digital platforms review. \u201cThe ALP encourages JSCEM to conduct a thorough examination of the impact that digital platforms are having on our democracy, and to pay particular regard to the proposition that Australian elections are vulnerable to influence by malinformation \u2013 defined by the ACCC as information deliberately spread by bad faith actors to inflict harm on a person, social group, organisation or country, particularly where this interferes with democratic processes,\u201d the submission seen by Guardian Australia says. Labor notes that the committee observed in its final report to the last federal parliament that the spread of disinformation online was increasingly influencing democratic processes throughout the world. That report highlighted examples like the 2016 US presidential election and the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. \u201cThe committee also noted that two connected threats to Australian democracy have been amplified by the economic and social transformation that digital platforms have enabled \u2013 first, hostile strategic actors have a greater ability to sow division in society by weaponising controversial or misleading information; and, second, the self-selection of news has contributed to the rise of echo chambers and filter bubbles in which misinformation spreads online, unchallenged,\u201d Labor\u2019s submission says. Guardian Australia revealed as part of an investigation into the death tax misinformation that the Labor campaign pressed Facebook repeatedly to deal with the false claims shared on the platform during the federal election, and escalated their complaints in the final week. But the social media giant declined to play censor. Simon Milner, the Singapore-based vice-president of the social media giant in the Asia-Pacific, told Labor after the election in correspondence seen by Guardian Australia: \u201cWe do not agree that it is our role to remove content that one side of a political debate considers to be false.\u201d Milner confirmed in the same correspondence that Facebook\u2019s independent fact-checking procedures had determined the death tax material was actually false, not just considered by Labor to be false. The Facebook executive said once the claims were found to be false on 30 April, \u201cwe demoted the original posts and thousands of similar posts\u201d. Posts were demoted in Facebook\u2019s News Feed but not removed from the platform. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In an interview with Guardian Australia in August, the ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, blasted Facebook\u2019s practices, and said the social media giant should have removed the bogus death tax claims given its own independent fact-checking processes had found the material to be false. Sims said Facebook had the capability to deal with the proliferation of fake news on the platform, but the social media behemoth is instead \u201cpalming off responsibility\u201d to protect its bottom line. The industry body representing Google, Facebook and Twitter has already rejected the ACCC\u2019s proposal for an industry code of conduct to fight fake news, warning that the recommendation would turn Australia\u2019s media regulator into the truth police. Labor does not claim the death tax misinformation cost it the federal election, but it believes the false claims did influence some voters. The opposition is also using the JSCEM inquiry to renew calls for Australia\u2019s donation disclosure threshold to be reduced from its current levelof $14,000 to $1,000, and for the introduction of real time disclosure. Labor has also flagged support for caps on expenditure that would apply to political parties and third-party campaigners. An analysis seen by Guardian Australia in mid-August indicates Clive Palmer outspent McDonald\u2019s, Toyota and Coles spruiking his United Australia party in the year leading up to the federal election, and spent more than $8m on saturation advertising in the final week of the contest \u2013 an unprecedented cash splash in an Australian election. In addition to the points on expenditure and disinformation, Labor\u2019s submission also raises concerns about below average enrolment rates in four of the five commonwealth electoral divisions where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples make up more than 10% of the population according to the 2016 census \u2013 Lingiari, Durack, Kennedy and Leichhardt. \u201cEnrolment rates below 80% in Lingiari and Durack are a particular concern,\u201d it says. Labor also references legal challenges alleging that the Liberals engaged in illegal conduct in breach of section 329 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Section 329 prohibits the publication or distribution of any matter or thing that is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote.

He says the challenge of the term will be to try and keep moving forward and to build a constituency for change. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue in the next decade to have the wars we\u2019ve had in the last decade. The last decade was supposed to be the critical decade. I don\u2019t know what beyond critical is. \u201cIf we get to 2030 with the level of inertia we\u2019ve had over the last decade, then we have profoundly let down our children and grandchildren\u201d.",

I talked and wrote to several journalists, but my time was short, and I was having lots of anxiety attacks.</p> <p>\u201cSo many journalists sent me messages on Twitter wanting to write about this story, but they just wanted to write about what happened to Sahar. They could just do a Google search to see what happened to her. But it\u2019s really important to write about what was the reason behind what she did. It wasn\u2019t a simple thing.\u201d</p> <p>The Open Stadiums movement, which describes itself on Twitter as \u201cA movement of Iranian Women seeking to end discrimination &amp; let women attend stadiums,\u201d has been active for almost 15 years.</p> <p>It began as a small group of female football fans protesting outside Azadi Stadium during a 2005 World Cup qualification match between Iran and Bahrain. Today, it has transformed into a movement for women\u2019s rights in Iran more generally, and become a lightning rod for critical discussions on how football\u2019s governing bodies act on human rights abuses.</p> <p>\u201c[The year] 2005 was the start of women claiming this right as a woman\u2019s right. For us, it was difficult in several aspects because some other feminists were so against us; they were saying things like \u2018in Iran we have much more important issues for women\u2019s rights and this is nothing compared to them\u2019,\u201d Open Stadiums said.</p> <p>\u201cI think one of the things we tried to show to them is it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right to access any public places, and we achieved this because now it is a top priority of women\u2019s demand for their rights in Iran.\u201d</p> <p>Before social media became popular, Open Stadiums wrote letters to Fifa and the AFC, demanding action be taken on Iran\u2019s violation of human rights. They wrote to domestic and international news outlets, trying to get somebody to listen, but were largely met with silence.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the world\u2019s media began to take notice. Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter was coming to Iran, accompanied by executive committee member, Moya Dodd, to meet with the country\u2019s officials.</p> <p>\u201cMoya was one of the first supporters of our stadium campaign,\u201d Open Stadiums said.</p> <p>\u201cEverywhere she went, she talked about this problem. At the time, none of the human rights organisations was following our problem. But when Moya talked about it, Human Rights Watch came and supported us. Lots of other human rights organisations and lots of other journalists around the world came. Basically, she connected us to the world of football a lot more.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted them to know on their official visit that half of this nation wanted to watch football, but they are banned from stadiums. And it happened Sepp Blatter, in his meeting with officials in Iran, he mentioned it. That was a big deal at the time.\u201d</p> <p>But Blatter\u2019s pleas were not heeded by Iran\u2019s authorities. And despite changes in leadership in both Iran and Fifa over the next few years, little progress was made towards lifting the stadium ban. That\u2019s when Open Stadiums took to Twitter.</p> <p>\u201c[Twitter] is really important. On one hand, lots of Iranian young people are on Twitter. But on the other hand, unfortunately because of language barriers, so many things happen in Iran but few people around the world get to know what\u2019s happening. That was my reason to write 90 per cent in English and share the news of what\u2019s happening around this campaign,\u201d Open Stadiums said.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I can say maybe 90 per cent of women know about this ban, and even if they don\u2019t like football, they want such a barrier [removed] from women in this society.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Open Stadiums accompanied several other activists overseas to attend the World Cup in Russia, banners and placards in tow. Whenever the Iranian men\u2019s national team played a game, Open Stadiums was there, forcing the world to take notice.</p> <p>The death of Blue Girl earlier this month once again catapulted Open Stadiums into the spotlight.</p> <p>In the days following her death, the @openStadiums account was flooded with online support from individuals, clubs and organisations expressing sadness and outrage at the tragedy. A tweet from Khodayari\u2019s beloved Esteghlal FC (after whose blue and white colours she is nicknamed), went viral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona/status/1171788631641661441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FC Barcelona is very sorry to hear about the death of Sahar Khodayari, may she rest in peace.

These folks believe as an article of faith that the family court is biased in favour of women, and they are looking for a champion to restore the natural order of things. Now why would you raise those expectations? Why open Pandora\u2019s box? Fiddling with the family court system is not a clear vote winner for the Coalition. For every angry and despairing dad, there\u2019s an angry, and, in some cases, frightened and despairing mum. They all vote, at least last time I looked. Why, if you were Morrison, would you put yourself in a position where you either have to give Hanson what she wants as a consequence of this taxpayer-funded indulgence to assist One Nation\u2019s two-decades-long courtship of the aggrieved, or decline to give her what she wants, and in the process hand her a stick to beat you with? Given the Liberals and Nationals tear themselves apart on social questions with only a minimum of encouragement \u2013 cue the abortion shitshow in New South Wales \u2013 has Morrison somehow missed the risk that this particular line of inquiry could also be a lightning rod inside his own partyroom? Does he think that doesn\u2019t matter because he can keep a lid on it? I really don\u2019t get it. Honestly, I don\u2019t. It looks boneheaded and, whatever you think of Morrison and his politics, dumb as a bag of hammers isn\u2019t the first phrase I\u2019d normally reach for.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi-led forces have launched airstrikes north of the Yemen port city of Hodeidah, claiming they were targeting Houthi rebels\u2019 capacity to mount remote-controlled assaults on shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels, battling Saudi support for the UN-recognised Yemen government for the past five years, claimed the airstrikes on four sites were in violation of the ceasefire agreement signed in December 2018 in Stockholm. A Houthi military spokesman described the assault as a serious escalation and a reprisal for the Houthi-claimed assault on Saudi oil installations last weekend. Defending the attacks, the Saudi coalition spokesman, Turki Al-Malik, said: \u201cThe coalition\u2019s naval forces detected an attempt by the terrorist Houthi militia backed by Iran to carry out an imminent act of aggression and terrorism in the southern Red Sea using an unmanned, rigged boat ... launched from Hodeidah province.\u201d The Saudi attacks were seen by the Houthis as an attempted show of strength in response to the last Saturday\u2019s devastating assault on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities, a strike that exposed the vulnerability of the Saudi oilfields to terrorism. The Houthis continue to claim responsibility for the attack on the facilities which temporarily knocked out half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production capacity, and raised deep questions about Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to press ahead with its IPO sale. Videos showing cars queuing for petrol in Saudi Arabia were posted on social media. Both Riyadh and Washington are continuing to point the finger directly at Iran, with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, describing the attack as an act of war by Tehran. Four UN weapons experts have arrived in Saudi Arabia, at the invitation of the government, to examine the weapons used in the assault on the two sites at Abqaiq and Khurais. Two of the experts have previous knowledge of the weapons used in the four-year Yemen civil war. The Saudi government also took representatives from international media to Abqaiq and Khurais to show the extraordinary scale of the damage and assure that the sites would be back to full production capacity within a month or two. Riyadh told reporters that the assaults, a mixture of cruise missiles and drones, came from the direction of Iran and the weaponry deployed is not in the possession of the Houthis. Saudi Arabia has not identified the precise point from which the attack was launched, but unnamed US intelligence sources claim it was southern Iran, and the attack was undertaken with the knowledge of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said such such claims are false and designed to distract attention from Saudi breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen. The focus of the dispute is likely to move next week to New York where Zarif is expected to meet European foreign ministers, including the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, at the UN general assembly. The chances of a direct meeting between the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and Donald Trump is ruled out by Iran, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is likely to try to act as a mediator between the two sides since he will hold bilateral meetings with both men.

      "body": "<p>If the success of an event like Friday\u2019s school strike can be measured, it is in the extent to which it changes the climate of opinion. Individuals, unions and other organisations that took part in the strike must play their part in reducing emissions. But when it comes to limiting global heating, governments have far more levers than anyone else. Global cooperation by politicians is essential to tackling the climate emergency. Since states are the world\u2019s most powerful organisations, many of the solutions will inevitably be national.</p> <p>In terms of their current and historic carbon emissions, and efforts to reduce them, there are huge differences between countries. There is no one-size-fits-all model of decarbonisation. In the UK, like everywhere else, progress is nowhere near fast enough. Carbon dioxide emissions have been falling for six years, and are at their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/28/greenhouse-gas-emissions-uk-fell-3-per-cent-in-2018-official-figures\" title=\"\">lowest level</a> since the reign of Queen Victoria. A law passed in June commits the government to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law\" title=\"\">reduce them to net zero</a> by 2050, with any residual greenhouse gas pollution offset by emissions-reduction schemes.</p> <p>But the energy policies pursued by Theresa May\u2019s and David Cameron\u2019s governments were more harmful than beneficial, with the deeply unpopular fracking industry propped up, and the astronomically expensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/hinkley-point-c-rising-costs-long-delays-power-station\" title=\"\">Hinkley Point C nuclear power station</a> pushed through, while the wind and solar industries were attacked through the removal of subsidies \u2013 even though Conservative voters, like everyone else, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/30/tories-urge-lifting-off-onshore-windfarm-ban\" title=\"\">prefer wind energy to fracking</a> by a huge margin. The official body that advises the UK government on climate change has warned that we are <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-uk-emissions-2019-progress-report-to-parliament/#key-findings\" title=\"\">on course to miss the targets</a> set out in the carbon budgets covering the years 2023-32, with just seven out of 24 indicators showing progress in 2018.</p> <p>In fact, the headline figure of a 44% fall in emissions below the 1990 baseline conceals multiple failures, with almost all the advances of recent years due to decarbonisation of the energy supply and phase-out of coal. Home insulation is one area where there has been little improvement. Farming is another. But since transport overtook energy to become the single <a href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-5357349/Transport-polluting-sector-greenhouse-gas-emissions-drop-5.html\" title=\"\">biggest source of domestic emissions</a> in 2016 \u2013 making up 33% of the total, higher than in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport_en\" title=\"\">much of the EU</a>, where closer to 25% is typical \u2013 it is arguably here that policymakers and others should most urgently focus attention.</p> <p>Motor vehicles, which are responsible for around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/uk-road-transport-emissions-up-since-1990-despite-efficiency-drive\" title=\"\">a fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions</a>, are by far the worst offender. The solution to the problem they present is relatively simple, but that does not make it easy.

      "bodyText": "If the success of an event like Friday\u2019s school strike can be measured, it is in the extent to which it changes the climate of opinion. Individuals, unions and other organisations that took part in the strike must play their part in reducing emissions. But when it comes to limiting global heating, governments have far more levers than anyone else. Global cooperation by politicians is essential to tackling the climate emergency. Since states are the world\u2019s most powerful organisations, many of the solutions will inevitably be national. In terms of their current and historic carbon emissions, and efforts to reduce them, there are huge differences between countries. There is no one-size-fits-all model of decarbonisation. In the UK, like everywhere else, progress is nowhere near fast enough. Carbon dioxide emissions have been falling for six years, and are at their lowest level since the reign of Queen Victoria. A law passed in June commits the government to reduce them to net zero by 2050, with any residual greenhouse gas pollution offset by emissions-reduction schemes. But the energy policies pursued by Theresa May\u2019s and David Cameron\u2019s governments were more harmful than beneficial, with the deeply unpopular fracking industry propped up, and the astronomically expensive Hinkley Point C nuclear power station pushed through, while the wind and solar industries were attacked through the removal of subsidies \u2013 even though Conservative voters, like everyone else, prefer wind energy to fracking by a huge margin. The official body that advises the UK government on climate change has warned that we are on course to miss the targets set out in the carbon budgets covering the years 2023-32, with just seven out of 24 indicators showing progress in 2018. In fact, the headline figure of a 44% fall in emissions below the 1990 baseline conceals multiple failures, with almost all the advances of recent years due to decarbonisation of the energy supply and phase-out of coal. Home insulation is one area where there has been little improvement. Farming is another. But since transport overtook energy to become the single biggest source of domestic emissions in 2016 \u2013 making up 33% of the total, higher than in much of the EU, where closer to 25% is typical \u2013 it is arguably here that policymakers and others should most urgently focus attention. Motor vehicles, which are responsible for around a fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions, are by far the worst offender. The solution to the problem they present is relatively simple, but that does not make it easy. Bringing forward a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2040 to 2035 or sooner, imposing strict regulations on heavy goods vehicles, and investing in electric car manufacturing and infrastructure, would please some people. So would increasing spending on public transport, reducing traffic in cities using congestion charging, and promoting walking and cycling with schemes such as car-free days. London will have its first such event on Sunday, four years after Paris. Such policies reduce the harm associated with air pollution, and make urban environments quieter and safer. But since many people enjoy driving and feel entitled to use their cars, they are also politically challenging. The same goes for any attempt to reduce air travel. But with figures this week showing that aviation emissions are rising much faster than expected, and that the UK, with a 4% global share, is behind only the US and China, reduce it we must. People should be encouraged to think about their transport decisions. But climate action must never be reduced to individual choices, and the onus is on politicians of all parties, starting with government ministers, to be brave. Momentum following this week\u2019s demonstrations must not give way to drift. Big steps to reduce transport emissions would be one good way to keep moving.",

From then a conspicuous lack of communication and common sense \u2013 not to mention emotional intelligence and education \u2013 allowed him to continue running his former under-23s fiefdom at Newcastle\u2019s outwardly modern academy base in a 1980s time warp.</p> <p>This \u201cLife on Mars\u201d type disconnect may explain that, while the FA commission punished him for \u201cthree obviously racist remarks\u201d they were satisfied he was \u201cnot racist in the sense of being ill-disposed to a person on grounds of their race or ethnicity\u201d.</p> <p>Those who know Beardsley well believe part of his mindset was stuck back in 1979 and a formative experience under the late Bob Stokoe at Carlisle United. He then was 18 and had broken into the professional game after a stint sweeping floors for \u00a390 a week at a Tyneside factory. Stokoe ruled by crude, military style, discipline and, in an era when football training grounds were often brutal places where senior players delighted in seizing on any perceived weaknesses among teammates, the young newcomer was bullied mercilessly, both physically and mentally.</p> <p>Teetotal in a hard-drinking habitat and, with that unfashionable pudding bowl haircut instantly setting him apart as a strangely old-fashioned teenager, Beardsley received what was euphemistically known as the \u201cfull treatment\u201d.</p> <p>If the experience toughened him to the point where he was able to impose his once fragile talent to often stunning, bewitchingly shimmying effect at Newcastle, Liverpool and Everton, it also moulded a frequently insensitive coach of the future.</p> <p>While many young Newcastle footballers would emerge from his school of hard knocks believing that passive-aggressive brand of sometimes scathing, scornful \u201ctough love\u201d \u2013 cutting put-downs and sometimes cruel humour rather than conventional shouting and swearing \u2013 was the making of them, others floundered in its unforgiving face.</p> <p>Thirteen years ago Roeder wanted to implement a very different coaching philosophy and, after he confronted Beardsley over their divergence of opinions, the parting of ways proved no surprise.</p> <p>After all, warning bells had first sounded at St James\u2019 Park in 2003 when, despite Beardsley being cleared of bullying academy players by a Premier League inquiry, disquiet lingered in certain quarters.</p> <p>Damningly, it was still there when, in January last year, complaints of racism saw him first suspended, then removed, from his post. This time the allegations were more specific \u2013 and damaging \u2013 but it seemed that his allegedly careless, hurtful, offensive use of language was symptomatic of a wider problem stemming from an era when the term \u201cwoke\u201d was still to be coined, football was a \u201cman\u2019s game\u201d and mental health a taboo subject.</p> <p>If the written submissions defending Beardsley\u2019s character supplied to the FA by colleagues \u2013 some black \u2013 including John Barnes, Andrew Cole, Les Ferdinand and Kevin Keegan emphasise that this was a complex, nuanced case, there can be little doubt that Beardsley struggled to adapt to changing times.</p> <p>Ashley had believed Beardsley\u2019s enduring fame would serve as a magnet, attracting the best youngsters to Newcastle, but the local hero turned out to not so much have clay feet as a wooden-headed mindset. It contained a self-destructive resistance to spheres such as psychology and emotional intelligence which have helped a host of coaches, Sam Allardyce and Gareth Southgate included, refine their modus operandi.</p> <p>By turning a blind eye to Beardsley\u2019s increasingly square-peg-in-round-hole persona, Newcastle\u2019s hierarchy exacerbated the problem. Exposure to more coaching courses might have helped but, remarkably, he did not complete his Uefa A licence until 2018.</p> <p>Given that his future employment prospects in football look extremely slim, it is likely to be of little use to a man who has morphed from local Tyneside icon to someone people point at in the street for all the wrong reasons.</p>",

Yet such concerns had seemingly evaporated by the time of Beardsley\u2019s reinstatement as a junior coach by Newcastle\u2019s owner Mike Ashley in 2009. From then a conspicuous lack of communication and common sense \u2013 not to mention emotional intelligence and education \u2013 allowed him to continue running his former under-23s fiefdom at Newcastle\u2019s outwardly modern academy base in a 1980s time warp. This \u201cLife on Mars\u201d type disconnect may explain that, while the FA commission punished him for \u201cthree obviously racist remarks\u201d they were satisfied he was \u201cnot racist in the sense of being ill-disposed to a person on grounds of their race or ethnicity\u201d. Those who know Beardsley well believe part of his mindset was stuck back in 1979 and a formative experience under the late Bob Stokoe at Carlisle United. He then was 18 and had broken into the professional game after a stint sweeping floors for \u00a390 a week at a Tyneside factory. Stokoe ruled by crude, military style, discipline and, in an era when football training grounds were often brutal places where senior players delighted in seizing on any perceived weaknesses among teammates, the young newcomer was bullied mercilessly, both physically and mentally. Teetotal in a hard-drinking habitat and, with that unfashionable pudding bowl haircut instantly setting him apart as a strangely old-fashioned teenager, Beardsley received what was euphemistically known as the \u201cfull treatment\u201d. If the experience toughened him to the point where he was able to impose his once fragile talent to often stunning, bewitchingly shimmying effect at Newcastle, Liverpool and Everton, it also moulded a frequently insensitive coach of the future. While many young Newcastle footballers would emerge from his school of hard knocks believing that passive-aggressive brand of sometimes scathing, scornful \u201ctough love\u201d \u2013 cutting put-downs and sometimes cruel humour rather than conventional shouting and swearing \u2013 was the making of them, others floundered in its unforgiving face. Thirteen years ago Roeder wanted to implement a very different coaching philosophy and, after he confronted Beardsley over their divergence of opinions, the parting of ways proved no surprise. After all, warning bells had first sounded at St James\u2019 Park in 2003 when, despite Beardsley being cleared of bullying academy players by a Premier League inquiry, disquiet lingered in certain quarters. Damningly, it was still there when, in January last year, complaints of racism saw him first suspended, then removed, from his post. This time the allegations were more specific \u2013 and damaging \u2013 but it seemed that his allegedly careless, hurtful, offensive use of language was symptomatic of a wider problem stemming from an era when the term \u201cwoke\u201d was still to be coined, football was a \u201cman\u2019s game\u201d and mental health a taboo subject. If the written submissions defending Beardsley\u2019s character supplied to the FA by colleagues \u2013 some black \u2013 including John Barnes, Andrew Cole, Les Ferdinand and Kevin Keegan emphasise that this was a complex, nuanced case, there can be little doubt that Beardsley struggled to adapt to changing times. Ashley had believed Beardsley\u2019s enduring fame would serve as a magnet, attracting the best youngsters to Newcastle, but the local hero turned out to not so much have clay feet as a wooden-headed mindset. It contained a self-destructive resistance to spheres such as psychology and emotional intelligence which have helped a host of coaches, Sam Allardyce and Gareth Southgate included, refine their modus operandi. By turning a blind eye to Beardsley\u2019s increasingly square-peg-in-round-hole persona, Newcastle\u2019s hierarchy exacerbated the problem. Exposure to more coaching courses might have helped but, remarkably, he did not complete his Uefa A licence until 2018. Given that his future employment prospects in football look extremely slim, it is likely to be of little use to a man who has morphed from local Tyneside icon to someone people point at in the street for all the wrong reasons.",

The assessments amount to an aggregate net liability across these periods of \u00a3902m covering tax, interest and penalties.\u201d A BAT spokesman said: \u201cBritish American Tobacco fully complies with all applicable tax legislation in each of the 200 markets where we operate around the world and we conduct all transactions that occur between BAT group companies using the internationally recognised arm\u2019s length principle. These transactions are fully in line with what independent parties would have paid, thus ensuring that the right amount of tax is paid. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the Dutch tax authorities assessment and as such, we are appealing this claim.\u201d While the vast majority of BAT\u2019s \u00a324.5bn of annual revenues come from traditional cigarettes, it is currently trying to rebrand itself around new products such as vaping. Last week the group announced plans to cut 2,300 jobs by 2020 in readiness for a shift towards non-tobacco products, a day after Donald Trump said he was considering a ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 September 2019 to remove a reference to BAT as the maker of Camel cigarettes. To clarify: BAT only owns the Camel brand in the US.",

They went away to Tottenham and won. They were competitive at Liverpool before a couple of errors made the scoreline go away (from them) a little bit. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNewcastle away is a difficult game, just like all the games we have played, but we will just focus on what we need to do well to get a positive result. We know we are going to have to play well and be lucky, that type of stuff, but we will try.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Potter will have full-back Martin Montoya available again following illness. \u201cThe boys are open-minded to being flexible and adaptable and they all want to take that challenge on,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWe lost three players after the international break, as an example, and you have to be able to adapt and do something different to before - those that needed to went out and demonstrated that.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T10:57:05.837Z\">at 11.57am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d84ac5b8f08f30dc5bbf079\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T10:39:45.651Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>You\u2019ll be wanting a weekend quiz won\u2019t you.

Chelsea, who also lost on penalties to Liverpool in the Uefa Super Cup final, have made an inconsistent start under Lampard, who has won only two of his first seven matches in charge. But Klopp believes the new Chelsea manager is developing an exciting young side that reminds him of his early work with Dortmund. </p> \n  <p>The Liverpool manager said: \u201cThey had a couple of problems but they sorted them well. It\u2019s a really exciting team. It reminds me a little bit of my team at Dortmund years back. They were really young and people always spoke about that but they only played because they were that good. </p> \n  <p>\u201cChelsea brought in Pulisic in the summer. I don\u2019t know about the money but it was \u00a350m-60m. All the players around him now have the same value. Tammy Abraham is a \u00a360m player, Mason Mount for sure is 60m, maybe more. Hudson-Odoi was already that. Jorginho is still young, Kante looks like he could play for the next 20 years, Kovacic, Barkley, then the experienced guys around them, Pedro, Willian, Giroud. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf there was one club in the world where a transfer ban didn\u2019t hit that bad it was probably Chelsea because of their transfer policy in the last few years with these high quality players out on loan. Abraham didn\u2019t learn where the goal is at Chelsea, he found it in different places. They are just a good team, they have all my respect. They are a proper contender for everything.

He wants to improve, wants to be better.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Talking of forwards, Anthony Martial is expected to miss the trip to West Ham on Sunday along with Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw. United could also be without Dan James, who missed the match against Astana with a knock sustained in the victory against Leicester. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cHe\u2019s not trained the last few days. Hopefully, but not sure. We\u2019ll have a recovery day with everyone and we\u2019ll see on Saturday.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Solskj\u00e6r said the likes of Axel Tuanzebe and Fred could also figure in the line-up on Sunday, as is 17-year-old Mason Greenwood after his display against Astana. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to keep players who perform well out of the team,\u201d the manager said. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d84996c8f08f30dc5bbef8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T09:19:39.334Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Newcastle news now, and Andy Carroll, no less, could be in for a second Toon debut when Brighton visit on Saturday.

Injury-wise, he tells us that Naby Keita\u2019s back in training today, but Alisson is not ready yet, though he is \u201cmaking good progress\u201d. Divock Origi\u2019s not ruled out.</p> \n  <p>As for converns around Virgil van Dijk\u2019s fitness, the manager replies: \u201cWe have four world class centre-halves and they can play together, so that can be enough.\u201d As for the man behind them, Adrian, Klopp hails his progress since his Southampton blunder. \u201cThe Southampton thing was exceptional but human beings make mistakes. He was only maybe two or three weeks here when we played Southampton and they know each other much better now and hopefully it can stay like this. It couldn\u2019t be the case in the first few games. </p> \n  <p>It\u2019s pointed out that Liverpool haven\u2019t won at Stamford Bridge since September 2016, and have a poor recent away record against the top six \u2013 why? \u201cBecause they\u2019re really good, that could be one reason. It\u2019s not good news but I don\u2019t feel it [the pressure]. We go there to get a result, you cannot go to Chelsea and guarantee you win a game, they\u2019re too good for that. We are much more successful winning all the other games. We\u2019ve had some unlucky moments and caught good performances from the opponents, but obviously there\u2019s a job to do.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked to assess Frank Lampard\u2019s record so far, he says, \u201cHe\u2019s done really well but it\u2019s not my job to talk about other managers. What I can say is they play exciting football, they\u2019ve played last two games in a different system in a busy period, so that\u2019s interesting, they\u2019re an exciting football team, young but good. It\u2019s not a surprise that he\u2019s done well. I said it last year and was not just being polite, it\u2019s the truth. He did an outstanding job at Derby so I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s doing a really good job at Chelsea.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one club in the world a transfer ban didn\u2019t hit that bad it\u2019s Chelsea because of their transfer policy of the last few years with a lot high quality players out on loan.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T09:17:27.258Z\">at 10.17am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8492618f08f30dc5bbef57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T08:51:19.311Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Some news nuggets </strong>you may have missed: Callum Hudson-Odoi has signed a new five-year deal at Chelsea, whose transfer ban seems to have made them realise the breadth of their young talent:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/19/callum-hudson-odoi-signs-new-chelsea-contract-to-2024\">Callum Hudson-Odoi commits to Chelsea with new five-year contract</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And Sheffield United\u2019s new owner Prince Abdullah has defended/explained the Bin Laden family\u2019s interest in investing in the club:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/19/sheffield-united-prince-abdullah-business-with-bin-ladens\">Sheffield United\u2019s Prince Abdullah defends Bin Ladens over club links</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And some random rumours, courtesy of Scott Murray:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/20/football-transfer-rumours-james-maddison-to-manchester-united\">Football transfer rumours: James Maddison to Manchester United?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d839c768f08f30dc5bbe88b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T08:48:01.814Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Morning everyone</strong>.

The second coming of Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores does at least appear to have made them more sprightly, if the draw against Arsenal is anything to go by. Elsewhere, Chris Wilder takes his marauding Sheffield United centre-backs to Everton and Newcastle take on a Brighton side who\u2019ve not won since eviscerating Watford on the opening day.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not too busy a morning on the press conference front, but J\u00fcrgen Klopp is due up soon.

      "bodyText": "And finally, I\u2019ll leave you with a piece from Barney Ronay about Eden Hazard and Real Madrid. Thanks for reading everyone. Quiz answer. So, just who was that well-known ref in the 90s indie band Powersleep? Answer: Jon Moss. He takes charge of Arsenal v Aston Villa this weekend. Fun fact: The drummer is Andy McVeigh, aka Burley Banksy, aka the guy who paints communication boxes in and around Elland Road. And the \u2018Bez\u2019 figure with his top off? That\u2019s a bloke called Duncan Jacques, who was recently awarded a CBE for outstanding services to education in often deprived areas in and around Leeds. Back down to Merseyside for this one. Up north now to Newcastle. It\u2019s a one-hour drive from the Etihad to Turf Moor in current traffic. Let\u2019s go there. And now to the champions... Let\u2019s whizz through some match previews - each containing likely line-ups, ref details, stats and odds. Our journey begins in the east midlands. Andre Gomes - middle name \u2018Tavares\u2019 - is a notable absentee at Goodison Park this weekend. Everton must be missing an angel due to the elegant midfielder\u2019s rib injury which also kept him out of last weekend\u2019s defeat at Bournemouth. The hosts are also without thigh-injury victim Jean-Philippe Gbamin. Visitors Sheffield United will lack some cutting edge due to Billy Sharp serving a ban for his straight red card in the home defeat to Southampton. Mo Besic is ineligible against his parent club. Tottenham have a bizarrely poor away record in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side have failed to win any of their last eight top-flight road trips, losing six of them. A trip to Leicester on Saturday isn\u2019t the easiest of tasks and yet Spurs have won four of their six games at the King Power Stadium. Stats eh. Mauricio Pochettino rotated in midweek so Serge Aurier and Danny Rose are set to return to the starting XI while Son Heung-min should also be on from the start after only playing the final 17 minutes away to Olympiakos. For Leicester, full-back Ben Chilwell missed training on Thursday but should be ready for Saturday\u2019s 12.30pm kick-off. Farke news. Norwich are fast becoming everyone\u2019s favourite second team this season but their German boss, Daniel Farke, is plonking his feet firmly auf dem boden despite the thrilling win over Manchester City last weekend. \u201cI wasn\u2019t carried away by the Man City win. Perhaps the reaction was a bit too much, but it is always a big topic when a team wins against them,\u201d said Farke. \u201cWe are still unbelievably modest, we always have to prove ourselves again and again. We have beaten one of the best teams in the world, but all the teams have different approaches. \u201cWe got back to proper, focused work (at training) and are hoping for a good result at Burnley. Man City was good for the confidence and mood, but Burnley will be completely different.\u201d And what does he expect from Sean Dyche\u2019s side? \u201cThey are quite a physical side and are dangerous in crossing situations, are sharp enough to win second balls, so we have to be awake at defending crosses. \u201cWe are totally different to Burnley in how we play, but when you stick together and have spirit, commitment and togetherness, like they have, then you can be successful, so they can be a role model for us. \u201cWe will try to get off the mark with our first away win as quickly as possible, but I don\u2019t expect it to be easy tomorrow.\u201d Farke has Patrick Roberts available again after the on-loan winger was not eligible to face parent club Manchester City. Elsewhere, midfielder Moritz Leitner has shaken off a calf injury and defender Grant Hanley looks to be over a pesky groin problem. In further Carrow Road news, Norwich sporting director Stuart Webber has signed a new three-year contract until the summer of 2022. No exciting news in Roy Hodgson\u2019s press conference. After making a mockery of their status of away-day giantkillers by going 4-0 down in the first half at Spurs last week, Crystal Palace will hope to become the latest side to cash in against a Wolves side which has already played 150 games this season. Midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate has been passed fit for Sunday\u2019s Selhurst Park match after being taken off at Spurs with an ankle problem while, looking ahead, Connor Wickham is due to return to training at the start of next week following his own ankle problem. Diogo Jota is set to return for second-bottom Wolves after Patrick Cutrone played in Thursday\u2019s 1-0 Group K loss at home to Braga. Jota has netted three goals in Europe this season but is yet to get off the mark in the Premier League. Ready for The Fiver? All sorts to surf through here including a lovely tale about Jock Stein. Some Liverpool team news for their game at Chelsea. Not an awful lot to report with the defence and front three picking themselves, leaving Jurgen Klopp to decide which of his midfielders to rotate in or out. Alisson Becker is now doing individual sessions with goalkeeping coach John Achterberg while Naby Keita is back in training too although neither are in contention. Divock Origi\u2019s ankle is set to keep him out so Rhian Brewster will offer back-up from the bench although the young striker is being earmarked for his full debut in next week\u2019s Carabao Cup tie at MK Dons. Man City team news. Pep Guardiola has confirmed that Fernandinho will continue in central defence at home to Watford. Apart from that, City\u2019s players came through unscathed form Wednesday\u2019s trip to Ukraine and midfielder Phil Foden should be available to be ignored again following a stomach virus. In the battle between City\u2019s season points and Premier League minutes played by Foden it\u2019s currently all square at 10 apiece. For Watford, Isaac Success looks set to be out for a month due to a thigh injury. Defender Craig Cathcart will return to training next week after suffering with the same affliction while Troy Deeney is still doing those hard yards in the gym after undergoing knee surgery last month. Barry on bogey teams. Yes, our very own Barry Glendenning has been investigating this most irrational of fears. Or is it? You are the ref. A guess from reader, Peter Oh, as to the identify of the mystery indie-band ref (see picture below at 14:56). \u201cMike Dean?\u201d Nope. Peter adds: \u201cI suppose it\u2019s better for Kante to be in and around than out and about.\u201d Dean Smith talks chess. Not part of Alan\u2019s pitch to Tony Hayers but a line from the Aston Villa manager\u2019s press conference. Villa travel to Arsenal on Sunday and Smith expects a tactical battle having had an extra insight into the workings of Gunners boss Unai Emery. \u201cHe has a wealth of experience at the top level and it\u2019ll be another chess match this weekend,\u201d said Smith, who may take advice from celebrity Villa fan Nigel Short. Damn, I meant Nigel Kennedy. Why have I fused those two in my head? ** \u201cI did my Pro Licence and went to do a study visit at Valencia when he was there. We played a pre-season friendly against Arsenal when I was at Brentford and then we drew them in the League Cup last year (losing 3-1). We\u2019ve had some good games against him already.\u201d ** Nigel Short once played Sol Campbell at chess. In and around. Robbie from Shetland has been in and around his keyboard area to send us the following e-mail on today\u2019s earlier posts (14:02 and 14:13): \u201cOK, I\u2019ll try and give Frank plausible deniability on the in and around us thing (see . Maybe he meant that it was nice to have Kante back in, and also it was nice to have him around. Us...\u201d Manuel Pellegrini steps up to the plate now. And he\u2019s given us a \u201cinsert you own joke here\u201d opportunity by declaring that he wants West Ham to play \u201cexactly the same way\u201d as Manchester United. The two meet at the London Stadium on Sunday and Pellegrini says: \u201cI think we are in a good moment so if we need to play against these big teams now we must demonstrate that we are able to play exactly the same way they do. \u201cWe know that we have a very strong team in front of us, now we have a good test against United and we will try to beat them and it\u2019s the only way to try to arrive in the first six positions of the table, demonstrating every game that you are able to do it.\u201d West Ham, who have the same number of points - eight from five games - as their Mancunian rivals, are still without defender Winston Reid while Manuel Lanzini will be assessed on Saturday for what is described as a \u201csmall problem\u201d by the PA. Time for a quiz question... The singer/guitarist in this 1990s indie band is refereeing a Premier League fixture this weekend. Name him! It\u2019s the big talking point of the Premier League weekend - who will get bragging rights when Burnley\u2019s Erik Pieters goes head to head with Norwich goalkeeper and best friend Tim Krul? As we all recall, Pieters once scored against Kruhl to give Stoke a 1-0 win at Newcastle. \u201cI am going to mention my goal against him when he was at Newcastle,\u201d said Pieters with a devilish glint in his eye during Friday\u2019s press conference. \u201cWe are really close, we met each other when we were 17 and ever since we have kept in contact and stayed close.\u201d So there you have it. In terms of team news, Johann Berg Gudmundsson could be back for the hosts following a calf injury. It\u2019s also Sean Dyche\u2019s 313th Burnley game - great new for fans of manager-based palindromes as well as taking him past Stan Ternant and up to fourth place on the Clarets\u2019 all-time list. Time for some Pep Guardiola press conf goss. The Manchester City boss has given an update on when centre-back John Stones will return: \u201cHopefully in one month, or a bit more, he will be back.\u201d Stones\u2019 absence has added to the longer-term loss of Aymeric Laporte, meaning City played Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho as a makeshift centre-half alongside Nicolas Otamendi in their Champions League tie away to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. That said, it went pretty well as City kept a clean sheet and won 3-0. Pep also says he expects Saturday\u2019s opponents, Watford, to present a stronger challenge than they did in the FA Cup final when City hammered them 6-0. \u201cNow it\u2019s totally different,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the season and they have changed their manager. I saw their game against Arsenal and - wow - the second half was incredible, the way they played.\u201d Where did this \u201cin and around\u201d usage come from? Increasingly heard in football terms when referring to a striker being \u201cin and around the box\u201d. But now Frank Lampard has expanded it to a player being \u201cin and around\u201d the team. Perhaps he\u2019s just a fan of the Small Faces? \u201cYes you have always been here Feeling deep inside A feeling that I could not see Or touch, or try to hide My love is in and around you I bless the day that I found you So listen up baby.\u201d Some Chelsea team news. And it could be of the positive variety with Frank Lampard giving an update on one of his young stars, Mason Mount. The midfielder suffered an ankle injury after a late challenge from Francis Coquelin in the Champions League defeat against Valencia on Tuesday but Lampard isn\u2019t ruling him out of Sunday\u2019s showdown with leaders Liverpool. \u201cHe\u2019s got a chance,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cWe all saw the image of the tackle which made it look really bad but we are trying to get him moving today. We\u2019ll make a call before the game.\u201d Talking of midfielders and ankle injuries, N\u2019Golo Kante looks to have shaken off one of his own after returning to training. \u201cIt\u2019s a boost with N\u2019Golo, we all know the importance of him to the team. The only question is how fit he is. We have to manage him but it\u2019s great to have him back in and around us.\u201d In and around us? \u201cIn football and life, everything is possible,\u201d says Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores. And coming from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with Arsenal last week surely proves the endless possibilities of the universe. Flores, who is back for a second spell at Vicarage Road, may have to look in a mirror and repeat that mantra plenty of times ahead of Saturday\u2019s games as his side travel to the Etihad. And, as the stats gods of Opta tell us: Manchester City have won their last 11 meetings with Watford in all competitions, scoring at least twice in each game (38 goals in total). \u201cFor us when we are preparing a match in the week, we are not thinking about how tough it is or not. Every single match (in the Premier League) is very tough,\u201d said Flores, whose Watford side prop up the table with a grand tally of just two points from five games. \u201cWe are preparing the match thinking about our possibilities and how we can do things and how we can try to manage. We are always positive. My priority basically is to try to find some style for us. We want to try and establish some order, some organisation and this is what I want.\u201d Because professionalism is... It\u2019s the Phil Jagielka derby at Goodison on Saturday. The England defender made 350 appearances for Everton and returns there with Sheffield United, the place where he launched his career. The Blades are currently 15th with five points from five games and two-club man Jagielka sees plenty of encouraging signs. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve not got massive household names who have played a lot of Premier League football and we didn\u2019t spend a tremendous amount of money in the summer, people have knocked us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in among the squad and the staff the belief has always been there and I think, when you\u2019ve done what these lads have done over the last few years, you can\u2019t do that without great determination and self-belief.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to lose confidence in this division because you do play against some fantastic players week in, week out. But as it stands, as you can tell from the previous couple of years, the momentum is still there and that\u2019s key for us at the moment.\u201d Meanwhile, Sheffield United\u2019s new owner, Prince Abdullah bin Musaad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, has been keen to offer his support to boss Chris Wilder in the wake of the acrimonious high court battle to wrest full control from Kevin McCabe \u2013 previously the holder of a 50% stake. He stressed: \u201cWe are blessed to have him. The results and the way we play our beautiful football speaks for itself. I have good harmony with Chris.\u201d Interesting to note that Prince Abdullah made his wealth from paper production. And he\u2019s not the first. Look at Jeff Lamp, 42 years old, got his own Porsche. That\u2019s from paper. Thanks Tom and good afternoon. I\u2019ll kick off with some Leicester news and words from the boss/guru himself, Brendan Rodgers. No less than eight of his side who featured in the 1-0 loss at Old Trafford last weekend were 23 or under and Rodgers says, as a group, they\u2019re still learning. \u201cFor us the ambition is important and there is real excitement going forward. We have a group of exciting young talent that need educating and we must give them confidence and belief to achieve,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a strong culture here of learning and wanting to do better. We have very talented young players and also a great group of experienced pros to complement that. \u201cAll of them have the hunger to improve and when you mix all that together then ambition will hopefully help you to progress. We are trying to form an identity here and we know we must improve - and we will over time. \u201cBut we know we haven\u2019t fully got to our top level yet and we\u2019re still in a good place - fifth in league and still in a cup and showing some good qualities with lots still to improve on.\u201d Plenty of squares crossed off there in \u2018Brendan Bingo\u2019. Right, I\u2019m handing over now and putting you in the capable hands of David Tindall. We\u2019ve got Pep Guardiola and Manuel Pellegrini media conferences, among other things, to come, as well as squadsheets for the weekend\u2019s big games. Bye. Paul Wilson chews over Liverpool and Manchester City\u2019s title prospects and says that though questions are suddenly being asked about Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, you\u2019d be daft to say it\u2019s already Liverpool\u2019s to lose: Embarrassing goals dept: here\u2019s a Qatari goalkeeper making the worst possible start to a match Welcome back. Some Arsenal chat from teenage sensation Bukayo Saka, who has cited the influence of assistant coach Freddie Ljungberg after the teenager hit his first senior Arsenal goal in Thursday\u2019s Europa League win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Nick Ames has more of the reaction from that here: Right, along with my colleagues, I\u2019m off on climate strike for the next half-hour. To steal a not-yet-trademarked big football club\u2019s slogan, this means more. Brighton\u2019s manager, Graham Potter, has been chin-wagging about the long trip to Newcastle tomorrow evening. He says his team must be flexible as they look to shackle the \u201cdifferent option\u201d of the fit-again Newcastle striker Andy Carroll, reports PA Media. Steve Bruce feels the former Liverpool player offers his team an \u201cold-fashioned centre-forward\u201d with which to target the opposition defence. Potter accepts keeping Carroll quiet will be a tough task, but is also aware that his players have to keep guard against a frontline that caused Tottenham so many problems a few weeks ago. \u201cI would imagine it is a big boost having someone of his quality,\u201d Potter said when asked on the prospect of facing a fully-fit Carroll on Saturday evening. \u201cIt is a different option, there is not too many like for like players as Andy Carroll around. \u201cI have been impressed with how their front three have combined anyway and played. They went away to Tottenham and won. They were competitive at Liverpool before a couple of errors made the scoreline go away (from them) a little bit. \u201cNewcastle away is a difficult game, just like all the games we have played, but we will just focus on what we need to do well to get a positive result. We know we are going to have to play well and be lucky, that type of stuff, but we will try.\u201d Potter will have full-back Martin Montoya available again following illness. \u201cThe boys are open-minded to being flexible and adaptable and they all want to take that challenge on,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWe lost three players after the international break, as an example, and you have to be able to adapt and do something different to before - those that needed to went out and demonstrated that.\u201d You\u2019ll be wanting a weekend quiz won\u2019t you. Well here you are: A Liverpool presser report: Jurgen Klopp has compared Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea to his early Borussia Dortmund team and said Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Callum Hudson-Odoi are already \u00a360m players. Liverpool travel to Stamford Bridge on Sunday when both teams will be looking to respond to midweek Champions League defeats. Chelsea, who also lost on penalties to Liverpool in the Uefa Super Cup final, have made an inconsistent start under Lampard, who has won only two of his first seven matches in charge. But Klopp believes the new Chelsea manager is developing an exciting young side that reminds him of his early work with Dortmund. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cThey had a couple of problems but they sorted them well. It\u2019s a really exciting team. It reminds me a little bit of my team at Dortmund years back. They were really young and people always spoke about that but they only played because they were that good. \u201cChelsea brought in Pulisic in the summer. I don\u2019t know about the money but it was \u00a350m-60m. All the players around him now have the same value. Tammy Abraham is a \u00a360m player, Mason Mount for sure is 60m, maybe more. Hudson-Odoi was already that. Jorginho is still young, Kante looks like he could play for the next 20 years, Kovacic, Barkley, then the experienced guys around them, Pedro, Willian, Giroud. \u201cIf there was one club in the world where a transfer ban didn\u2019t hit that bad it was probably Chelsea because of their transfer policy in the last few years with these high quality players out on loan. Abraham didn\u2019t learn where the goal is at Chelsea, he found it in different places. They are just a good team, they have all my respect. They are a proper contender for everything. Now we play there and we want to get something.\u201d Here\u2019s David Hytner with that Tottenham loan refinance story in full: Some financial crisis news: the BBC is reporting that Southend United have been hit with a winding-up petition by HMRC. It\u2019s their second this year. The new petition is due to be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice on 16 October. Southend have made a terrible start to their League One campaign, currently lie second from bottom above the even-more-afflicted Bolton, and are managerless after Kevin Bond quit earlier this month. Southampton v Bournemouth chat: Saints manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, is feeling pretty chipper about his side. \u201cYou can feel that these players are believing in what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he says, \u201cIt\u2019ll be a tough and tactically demanding game against Bouremouth but an interesting one for the players and the crowd. It can be a very open game but hope we get the right result Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe adds: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for back to back wins in the Premier League, which is a very difficult thing to do, but there should be a good atmosphere, the rivalry [between Bournemouth and Southampton] is gaining in everybody\u2019s focus the more games we have, and the more rivalry will become more intense.\u201d One of the Southampton players in an upbeat mood this season so far is Jan Bednarek, whom our own Ben Fisher met earlier in the week. Catch up with what he said here: Some Spurs news: Daniel Levy has announced that the club will be refinancing their new-stadium loans but insisted that he will continue to run Tottenham on the relatively frugal business plan that has characterised his chairmanship. The full story on that from our man David Hytner will be up shortly. As for the team, Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking before tomorrow lunchtime\u2019s match at Leicester, and he thinks it\u2019s too early to tell how the season\u2019s going to pan out. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to talk about contenders and what will happen in the future. Still all the teams are finding their best,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only play five games in the Premier League. Until you play between 10 and 15 games, it\u2019s difficult to see what will happen and the real contenders, teams who are going to be serious contenders. It is still so early.\u201d \u201cLeicester is a very good team with a lot of unbelievable players. After winning the Premier League they rebuild their squad and are doing fantastic with a great manager like Brendan Rodgers, who I know very well. They are doing a fantastic job.\u201d Reflecting on the 2-2 draw at Olympiakos, and the criticism levelled at Christian Eriksen\u2019s performance in particular, Pochettino admitted: \u201cThe collective performance wasn\u2019t the best from us. I am happy with the commitment of Christian, he ran a lot and was very committed with the team, the effort but I think I am not concerned about him.\u201d Some reading for you\u2019se: Ben Fisher surveys the top-flight\u2019s subs\u2019 benches and training grounds for this piece on the Premier League\u2019s forgotten men. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has aired some thoughts, in the aftermath of that narrow Man Utd win over Astana. Including that he\u2019s not that stressed by Marcus Rashford\u2019s recent lack of goals because the forward has demonstrated hunger and determination to improve. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the chances,,of course he could have had three [against Astana]. The keeper made a few fantastic saves. I don\u2019t worry about that, no. We\u2019re working every single day in training with Marcus. He wants to improve, wants to be better.\u201d Talking of forwards, Anthony Martial is expected to miss the trip to West Ham on Sunday along with Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw. United could also be without Dan James, who missed the match against Astana with a knock sustained in the victory against Leicester. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cHe\u2019s not trained the last few days. Hopefully, but not sure. We\u2019ll have a recovery day with everyone and we\u2019ll see on Saturday.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said the likes of Axel Tuanzebe and Fred could also figure in the line-up on Sunday, as is 17-year-old Mason Greenwood after his display against Astana. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to keep players who perform well out of the team,\u201d the manager said. Newcastle news now, and Andy Carroll, no less, could be in for a second Toon debut when Brighton visit on Saturday. Here\u2019s this from PA Media: Andy Carroll could make a second debut for Newcastle against Brighton on Saturday evening after finally shaking off an ankle injury. The 30-year-old last played for former club West Ham in February, and later underwent surgery to address a long-standing problem, but has trained all week with the Magpies, who he joined at the end of the summer transfer window, and is ready to resume his carer. Head coach Steve Bruce said: \u201cAs long as he comes through today OK - touch wood, he\u2019ll come through today OK - but yes, he will be involved, which is good news for all of us. \u201cAt the top end of the pitch, him and Allan Saint-Maximin as well, we have been a little bit short - and Dwight Gayle is another one - so we have had limited options up top, but certainly the return of Andy and Allan give us something which obviously can only benefit us.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp speaks! The Liverpool manager is up before the media, ahead of Sunday\u2019s trip to Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea (TM). Injury-wise, he tells us that Naby Keita\u2019s back in training today, but Alisson is not ready yet, though he is \u201cmaking good progress\u201d. Divock Origi\u2019s not ruled out. As for converns around Virgil van Dijk\u2019s fitness, the manager replies: \u201cWe have four world class centre-halves and they can play together, so that can be enough.\u201d As for the man behind them, Adrian, Klopp hails his progress since his Southampton blunder. \u201cThe Southampton thing was exceptional but human beings make mistakes. He was only maybe two or three weeks here when we played Southampton and they know each other much better now and hopefully it can stay like this. It couldn\u2019t be the case in the first few games. It\u2019s pointed out that Liverpool haven\u2019t won at Stamford Bridge since September 2016, and have a poor recent away record against the top six \u2013 why? \u201cBecause they\u2019re really good, that could be one reason. It\u2019s not good news but I don\u2019t feel it [the pressure]. We go there to get a result, you cannot go to Chelsea and guarantee you win a game, they\u2019re too good for that. We are much more successful winning all the other games. We\u2019ve had some unlucky moments and caught good performances from the opponents, but obviously there\u2019s a job to do.\u201d Asked to assess Frank Lampard\u2019s record so far, he says, \u201cHe\u2019s done really well but it\u2019s not my job to talk about other managers. What I can say is they play exciting football, they\u2019ve played last two games in a different system in a busy period, so that\u2019s interesting, they\u2019re an exciting football team, young but good. It\u2019s not a surprise that he\u2019s done well. I said it last year and was not just being polite, it\u2019s the truth. He did an outstanding job at Derby so I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s doing a really good job at Chelsea. \u201cIf there\u2019s one club in the world a transfer ban didn\u2019t hit that bad it\u2019s Chelsea because of their transfer policy of the last few years with a lot high quality players out on loan.\u201d Some news nuggets you may have missed: Callum Hudson-Odoi has signed a new five-year deal at Chelsea, whose transfer ban seems to have made them realise the breadth of their young talent: And Sheffield United\u2019s new owner Prince Abdullah has defended/explained the Bin Laden family\u2019s interest in investing in the club: And some random rumours, courtesy of Scott Murray: Morning everyone. It\u2019s been a busy old week and we\u2019re back in the cycle of Premier League teams being in action pretty much every day. No sooner have we digested last night\u2019s European action \u2013 featuring relief for Manchester United, satisfaction for Rangers and Celtic, worry for Wolves and an upswing in the Arsenal rollercoaster \u2013 than we\u2019re pitched into the weekend\u2019s Premier League action. Starting tonight at St Mary\u2019s, where Southampton host Bournemouth in what should be an agreeable mid-table south coast tussle, Saints seeking their first home win of the season and Bournemouth looking to build on a deserved win over Everton last Sunday. Tomorrow\u2019s programme gives Leicester another chance to test their top-six credentials against a Spurs side who looked a bit ragged in Greece on Wednesday, while Norwich visit Burnley full of the joys of autumn after turning over Manchester City, who host Watford in what the visitors will hope won\u2019t be a repeat of the 6-0 Cup final non-event in May. The second coming of Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores does at least appear to have made them more sprightly, if the draw against Arsenal is anything to go by. Elsewhere, Chris Wilder takes his marauding Sheffield United centre-backs to Everton and Newcastle take on a Brighton side who\u2019ve not won since eviscerating Watford on the opening day. It\u2019s not too busy a morning on the press conference front, but J\u00fcrgen Klopp is due up soon. We\u2019ll have team news and more about the above games and others as the day progresses. So stick around.",

It is now for the trustees to consider our guidance and how they manage their obligations in the best interests of their charity.</p> <p>\u201cMore generally, charities hold important positions of trust in society so it is vital that any relationships with non-charitable organisations are clear to those the charity is set up to help.</p> <p>\u201cThe public rightly expect charities to be driven only by their charitable mission and purpose in everything they do. New guidance from the commission makes clear that trustees should work to defend and promote their independence from non-charitable organisations at all times.\u201d</p> <p>Ucas said its board had met to discuss the commission\u2019s message as well as the complaints from Lewis and students about the mailings.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing discussion, we will work with Future Finance to ensure further messages from Ucas Media include clear information on all the funding options available to students, stressing that a government-funded loan should always been the first port of call as well as signal the likely interest rates and terms within the email,\u201d Ucas said in response to Lewis.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important that everyone has access to high-quality information and advice on all aspects of finance relating to higher education, and we will look to strengthen the information and advice we provide through our website, emails and across social media.\u201d</p> <p>Ucas has previously defended its commercial marketing by saying the communications from Ucas Media were only sent to students who opted in to receive them.</p> <p>But Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, said he was unhappy with Ucas\u2019s response, and called for it to bar advertising by commercial lenders.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fundamental error by Ucas. With its privileged position and being seen as an official body communicating with students, Ucas should be whiter than white,\u201d Lewis said.</p> <p>\u201cThe charity has to remember that it is there to help admissions for students, and the fundraising from its commercial arm must be a distant, secondary consideration. But this response shows that it isn\u2019t a secondary consideration.</p> <p>\u201cI again call on Ucas to drop adverts for commercial lenders. Its reputation and brand among students make people feel that it is some form of official communication. The argument that it\u2019s opt-in only, when dealing with impressionable young people, that\u2019s simply not enough of a protection.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis argued that because it held unique access to data on students, Ucas needed to be especially careful on who it allowed access to its services.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to say Ucas can\u2019t use advertising at all. But those advertisements must be things that the charity, not the commercial arm, would be happy to recommend to students if it wasn\u2019t being paid,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn an era where universities are facing real criticism over dealing with the mental health issues for students, I think it is totally inappropriate for an official university body to be promoting commercial debt that risks exacerbating the stress and mental health of their students.\u201d said Lewis, who chairs the <a href=\"https://www.moneyandmentalhealth.org/\">Money and Mental Health Policy Institute</a>.</p> <p>Eva Crossan Jory, the National Union of Students\u2019 vice-president for student welfare, said Ucas should review its operations to benefit students, with increasing numbers of students now using unsecured loans.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of this debt can often act as a trigger for mental or physical problems, and often has a knock-on effect on attainment and employment outcomes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Ucas said it wanted to meet Lewis \u201cto discuss how we can collectively further support the interests of students\u201d, but Lewis said he did not want Ucas to set the agenda.</p> <p>\u201cThe first point for me will be discussing that it needs to drop these types of advertising,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cUltimately, the only thing to suggest would be that you treat all information from Ucas with a pinch of salt. It would be a sad state of affairs to have to say that.\u201d</p> <p>Future Finance said it always advises applicants to check they had made full use of the government support available to them before considering taking out a loan.

      "bodyText": "The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service has been rebuked by the Charity Commission over its role in the marketing of private loans to students and school-leavers, with the regulator warning that Ucas needs to rein in its commercial arm. The commission\u2019s intervention followed direct mail and email marketing sent to students last month by Ucas Media \u2013 Ucas\u2019s commercial subsidiary \u2013 advertising Future Finance, a company offering private loans targeted at students. After a complaint by Martin Lewis, the consumer finance expert, the commission sent guidance to Ucas\u2019s board, warning of the need to maintain its independence from its non-charitable subsidiary. A spokesperson for the commission said: \u201cWe\u2019ve contacted Ucas to remind them of their obligations towards their charity. It is now for the trustees to consider our guidance and how they manage their obligations in the best interests of their charity. \u201cMore generally, charities hold important positions of trust in society so it is vital that any relationships with non-charitable organisations are clear to those the charity is set up to help. \u201cThe public rightly expect charities to be driven only by their charitable mission and purpose in everything they do. New guidance from the commission makes clear that trustees should work to defend and promote their independence from non-charitable organisations at all times.\u201d Ucas said its board had met to discuss the commission\u2019s message as well as the complaints from Lewis and students about the mailings. \u201cFollowing discussion, we will work with Future Finance to ensure further messages from Ucas Media include clear information on all the funding options available to students, stressing that a government-funded loan should always been the first port of call as well as signal the likely interest rates and terms within the email,\u201d Ucas said in response to Lewis. \u201cIt is important that everyone has access to high-quality information and advice on all aspects of finance relating to higher education, and we will look to strengthen the information and advice we provide through our website, emails and across social media.\u201d Ucas has previously defended its commercial marketing by saying the communications from Ucas Media were only sent to students who opted in to receive them. But Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, said he was unhappy with Ucas\u2019s response, and called for it to bar advertising by commercial lenders. \u201cThis is a fundamental error by Ucas. With its privileged position and being seen as an official body communicating with students, Ucas should be whiter than white,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe charity has to remember that it is there to help admissions for students, and the fundraising from its commercial arm must be a distant, secondary consideration. But this response shows that it isn\u2019t a secondary consideration. \u201cI again call on Ucas to drop adverts for commercial lenders. Its reputation and brand among students make people feel that it is some form of official communication. The argument that it\u2019s opt-in only, when dealing with impressionable young people, that\u2019s simply not enough of a protection.\u201d Lewis argued that because it held unique access to data on students, Ucas needed to be especially careful on who it allowed access to its services. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say Ucas can\u2019t use advertising at all. But those advertisements must be things that the charity, not the commercial arm, would be happy to recommend to students if it wasn\u2019t being paid,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an era where universities are facing real criticism over dealing with the mental health issues for students, I think it is totally inappropriate for an official university body to be promoting commercial debt that risks exacerbating the stress and mental health of their students.\u201d said Lewis, who chairs the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. Eva Crossan Jory, the National Union of Students\u2019 vice-president for student welfare, said Ucas should review its operations to benefit students, with increasing numbers of students now using unsecured loans. \u201cThe impact of this debt can often act as a trigger for mental or physical problems, and often has a knock-on effect on attainment and employment outcomes,\u201d she said. Ucas said it wanted to meet Lewis \u201cto discuss how we can collectively further support the interests of students\u201d, but Lewis said he did not want Ucas to set the agenda. \u201cThe first point for me will be discussing that it needs to drop these types of advertising,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cUltimately, the only thing to suggest would be that you treat all information from Ucas with a pinch of salt. It would be a sad state of affairs to have to say that.\u201d Future Finance said it always advises applicants to check they had made full use of the government support available to them before considering taking out a loan. Olga Dolchenko, the company\u2019s chief executive, said it never encouraged students to borrow more than they could afford. Ucas is governed by trustees dominated by university vice-chancellors. Its income is largely derived from \u00a324 application fees paid each year by hundreds of thousands of prospective undergraduates seeking places at UK higher education institutions, and fees from universities for acceptances. Ucas Media, the commercial subsidiary, donates its profits to the parent charity. \u201cWe don\u2019t receive any direct financial support from the government, so our commercial activities help us deliver our charitable objectives, whilst keeping costs down for students and education providers,\u201d Ucas states. In 2018 Ucas received \u00a327m in fees, including nearly \u00a314m from applicants. Ucas Media reported income of \u00a319m, of which profits of \u00a34.3m was paid out to Ucas via gift aid.

      "bodyText": "From the small sun-drenched Inner Hebridean island of Iona to the packed streets of central London, parents and grandparents, children and trade unionists have stepped out of their Friday routines to tell their political leaders time is running out to tackle the climate crisis. Organisers said it was the biggest-ever environmental protest the UK had seen, with 300,000-350,000 taking part, including more than 100,000 people in London and tens of thousands more in towns and cities from Edinburgh to Bristol, Leeds to Brighton, Bedford to Cambridge. There were more than 200 demonstrations across the UK. Jake Woodier, who campaigns for the Student Climate Network, which co-organised the event, said it marked a turning point in the fight to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cMillions of people across the globe, and hundreds of thousands across the UK, have sent a clear message about the need for urgent climate action,\u201d he said from the protest in central London. \u201cThe people have spoken and said enough is enough ... We need an ambitious Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis head on and deliver a world that works for everyone.\u201d In London, young people \u2013 who have been protesting in growing numbers on Fridays this year \u2013 were joined by trade unionists, politicians, and two generations of antecedents. Mariana Clayton, 41, was with her two-year-old daughter, Albe, in Parliament Square. She said: \u201cI am so fearful for the future. I feel totally powerless \u2013 but here, together we have a chance to get our voice heard and force action.\u201d Emma Beresford, 14, was with her younger brother, Archie, and their mother, Anna. She said: \u201cI went on the march for a people\u2019s vote for Brexit but climate change is an even more urgent and pressing issue than anything else.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn and Green MP Caroline Lucas addressed the crowd in London, with the Labour leader promising a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d \u2013 a version of the Green New Deal \u2013 to tackle the climate crisis and create hundreds of thousands of well paid unionised jobs. However, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, struck a different note earlier in the day when he said the cause \u2013 which he said he supported \u2013 did not warrant missing school. That advice was ignored by hundreds of thousands of people across the UK. In Edinburgh, a huge crowd marched from the Meadows, down the Royal Mile to the Scottish parliament. They were clapped and cheered by onlookers, saluted by a bagpiper and entertained by a percussion drummer and jazz bands. Chants of \u201cHey hey, ho ho, climate change has got to go!\u201d filled the streets of the Scottish capital along with tens of thousands of people, bearing banners that were both funny and dark: \u201c33.2C in Scotland. Time to panic!\u201d, \u201cSea levels are rising. So are we!\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019ll die of old age. I\u2019ll die of climate change.\u201d Ruby, 10, and Dougie, seven, have been ahead of the shift in public opinion. They were inspired by Greta Thunberg to start striking outside the Scottish parliament on a cold day in January. \u201cThere was only me and my brother there and the police. The next week there was one more, and eventually loads of people, and now there is this,\u201d Ruby said, gesturing to the vast procession that stretched back as far as the eye could see. \u201cI\u2019m happy and proud.\u201d Her younger brother said the demonstration was \u201cabsolutely amazing\u201d. The seven-year-old was among those due to give a speech outside the Scottish legislature. His message to politicians was straightforward: \u201cThey are trying their hardest but they need to try lots harder.\u201d In Manchester the square outside the city\u2019s grand central library was taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and demanding change. The city\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the protest when he gave a speech pledging that \u201cfracking is the past, it is not the future\u201d \u2013 but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next. The local schoolgirl gave a rousing speech that took aim at politicians for their \u201clies\u201d, before turning directly to Burnham. She said: \u201cLies, when you don\u2019t count the airport in the emission figures! Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution-related deaths in Manchester just last year \u2013 but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats.\u201d Elsewhere, in Birmingham demonstrators staged a die-in outside the BBC offices in the city to protest at what they said was inadequate coverage of the climate crisis. Similar actions were staged at an Oxford University open day for prospective students and by 3,000 Cambridge residents in King\u2019s Parade in the city. One of those taking part in the Oxford protest, Ell Ludlow, said: \u201cWe are doing this because we feel like a world leading university should lead on climate. Oxford is not doing that at the moment and so we want them to act now.\u201d In Iona, a few dozen members of the island community supported local children from the primary school in a climate strike \u201cin the centre of the island, near the jetty\u201d. Sarah Macdonald, an island resident and member of the Oran Creative Crafts cooperative, said: \u201cIn our small island community, we see shorelines eroding and changing; the gales that hit our exposed wee island are growing more frequent. \u201cMost importantly, we see that the island\u2019s children care deeply about this issue. We have to support them, speak out with them for their future. And we have to do it now.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Labour should consider voting for a Boris Johnson Brexit deal in exchange for the promise of a referendum, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has told the Guardian.</p> <p>As anti-Brexit activists prepare to make their voices heard at Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton this weekend, Thornberry suggested her party could allow a deal to pass through parliament \u2013 if they could thereby secure a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s something we would have to consider.

All the Tory media seem to be interested in is the Irish backstop, but there\u2019s a whole range of other stuff we wouldn\u2019t touch with a bargepole,\u201d the shadow chancellor told the Daily Mirror.</p> <p>Thornberry\u2019s intervention came as senior Corbyn loyalists try to head off a confrontation over Brexit in Brighton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/18/labour-heading-for-brexit-strategy-showdown-in-brighton\">Labour heading for Brexit strategy showdown in Brighton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who was among those encouraging the Labour leader to embrace the idea of a referendum earlier this year, said his current position was now one all party members should be able to support.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there is an element, in Westminster, of people pursuing a remain argument because they want to undermine Jeremy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the thing is, whatever Jeremy does is not enough.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point they were all saying, \u2018Jeremy\u2019s got to come out for a people\u2019s vote.\u2019 Well Jeremy\u2019s come out for a people\u2019s vote. He\u2019s saying \u2013 and he\u2019s very clear on this \u2013 it\u2019s got to go back to the people. But all these people who were calling for a people\u2019s vote, they\u2019re not saying, \u2018Oh that\u2019s good.\u2019 They\u2019ve got some other impossibilist demand.\u201d</p> <p>She urged activists to focus instead on other issues in Brighton, including tackling the climate crisis and liberalising immigration policy, which she believes is more of a motivating factor for many younger voters than Brexit.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Brexit policy has shifted significantly in a series of stages since last year\u2019s party conference passed a motion saying a referendum must be among the options \u201con the table\u201d.</p> <p>More than 90 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions this year, with the majority demanding a remain position.</p> <p>Their views will be hammered out into one or more \u201ccomposite motions\u201d, to be debated on Monday, and the party\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) could also table its own Brexit policy statement.</p> <p>Some anti-Brexit Labour activists are wary of sparking a direct conflict with the party leadership. But Thornberry warned that unless it took a clear stance, Labour risked losing voters on both sides of the Brexit divide.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of Labour voters are remain voters. And in so-called leave seats, 40% of people will have voted remain. And they will be Labour voters. That\u2019s what the polling shows. And if we lose those, we lose those seats.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI think that a lot of the leave voters are already extremely ambivalent about the Labour party. What we don\u2019t want to do is lose people on both sides.</p> <p>\u201cIt is like, if you walk in the middle of the road and a car\u2019s coming towards you, you have to decide which side you\u2019re going to jump.\u201d</p> <p>Thornberry is backed by remain-supporting shadow cabinet members, including Tom Watson, in entertaining the idea of supporting a Johnson deal on condition it is put to the public.</p> <p>A similar plan was proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson as Theresa May tried to win MPs\u2019 backing for her Brexit deal \u2013 and its proponents believe they could potentially win a majority, with the support of the 21 former Conservatives expelled by Johnson.</p> <p>Watson said: \u201cEmily is right to try to find an understanding with others that allows the people to decide on whether a government deal is credible. We should all be looking for solutions to end years of parliamentary deadlock.\u201d</p> <p>However, other shadow cabinet members remain deeply sceptical. Abbott said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it\u2019s got a referendum attached. That\u2019s why I was against Kyle-Wilson.</p> <p>\u201cEither it\u2019s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market \u2013 or it\u2019s not. The referendum is not an end in itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don\u2019t support it,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Unlike Thornberry, Abbott also believes it would be legitimate for Corbyn to take a back seat during a future referendum.</p> <p>\u201cIf Jeremy is going to be a prime minister for the whole country, it is difficult for him to take a position which is contrary to 17 million voters,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Thornberry was scathing about Johnson, whom she shadowed during his time as foreign secretary \u2013 the one cabinet role he held before becoming prime minister in July.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any grasp of detail so the way to beat him was to be a girly swot,\u201d she said, pointedly using the same phrase Johnson applied to his predecessor David Cameron, in a leaked memo.</p> <p>She said such language, together with Johnson\u2019s taunting of Corbyn as a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d, was indicative of the prime minister\u2019s attitude to women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/20/fresh-brexit-talks-row-uk-eu-proposals-secret\">Talks \u2018going backwards\u2019 as UK asks EU to keep its proposals secret</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s deeply ingrained, the way that he talks about women. I think he has a contempt for women,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She believes Johnson\u2019s tough-guy rhetoric, including comparing himself to the Incredible Hulk, will not endear him to female voters.</p> <p>\u201cI think they see him as a buffoon and somebody who doesn\u2019t understand people, but also doesn\u2019t care about the things that lots of women care about,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think women want to be governed by the Hulk. They don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>And she argued that Johnson \u2013 with the aid of his key adviser, Dominic Cummings \u2013 was deliberately styling himself as a political \u201cstrongman\u201d in the mould of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>\u201cWe have all these strong men in politics \u2013 whether it\u2019s Brazil, or the Philippines, or Trump, or Putin. They\u2019re all big men: it\u2019s let\u2019s look up to them, don\u2019t be afraid, they\u2019re looking after things. It\u2019s so fundamentally anti-democratic.

We\u2019ll implement the manifesto. If any of those minor parties refuse to support us we\u2019ll go back to the people.\u201d</p>",

He\u2019s saying \u2013 and he\u2019s very clear on this \u2013 it\u2019s got to go back to the people. But all these people who were calling for a people\u2019s vote, they\u2019re not saying, \u2018Oh that\u2019s good.\u2019 They\u2019ve got some other impossibilist demand.\u201d She urged activists to focus instead on other issues in Brighton, including tackling the climate crisis and liberalising immigration policy, which she believes is more of a motivating factor for many younger voters than Brexit. Labour\u2019s Brexit policy has shifted significantly in a series of stages since last year\u2019s party conference passed a motion saying a referendum must be among the options \u201con the table\u201d. More than 90 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions this year, with the majority demanding a remain position. Their views will be hammered out into one or more \u201ccomposite motions\u201d, to be debated on Monday, and the party\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) could also table its own Brexit policy statement. Some anti-Brexit Labour activists are wary of sparking a direct conflict with the party leadership. But Thornberry warned that unless it took a clear stance, Labour risked losing voters on both sides of the Brexit divide. \u201cThe vast majority of Labour voters are remain voters. And in so-called leave seats, 40% of people will have voted remain. And they will be Labour voters. That\u2019s what the polling shows. And if we lose those, we lose those seats.\u201d She added: \u201cI think that a lot of the leave voters are already extremely ambivalent about the Labour party. What we don\u2019t want to do is lose people on both sides. \u201cIt is like, if you walk in the middle of the road and a car\u2019s coming towards you, you have to decide which side you\u2019re going to jump.\u201d Thornberry is backed by remain-supporting shadow cabinet members, including Tom Watson, in entertaining the idea of supporting a Johnson deal on condition it is put to the public. A similar plan was proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson as Theresa May tried to win MPs\u2019 backing for her Brexit deal \u2013 and its proponents believe they could potentially win a majority, with the support of the 21 former Conservatives expelled by Johnson. Watson said: \u201cEmily is right to try to find an understanding with others that allows the people to decide on whether a government deal is credible. We should all be looking for solutions to end years of parliamentary deadlock.\u201d However, other shadow cabinet members remain deeply sceptical. Abbott said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it\u2019s got a referendum attached. That\u2019s why I was against Kyle-Wilson. \u201cEither it\u2019s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market \u2013 or it\u2019s not. The referendum is not an end in itself.\u201d \u201cKyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don\u2019t support it,\u201d she added. Unlike Thornberry, Abbott also believes it would be legitimate for Corbyn to take a back seat during a future referendum. \u201cIf Jeremy is going to be a prime minister for the whole country, it is difficult for him to take a position which is contrary to 17 million voters,\u201d she said. Thornberry was scathing about Johnson, whom she shadowed during his time as foreign secretary \u2013 the one cabinet role he held before becoming prime minister in July. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any grasp of detail so the way to beat him was to be a girly swot,\u201d she said, pointedly using the same phrase Johnson applied to his predecessor David Cameron, in a leaked memo. She said such language, together with Johnson\u2019s taunting of Corbyn as a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d, was indicative of the prime minister\u2019s attitude to women. \u201cI think it\u2019s deeply ingrained, the way that he talks about women. I think he has a contempt for women,\u201d she said. She believes Johnson\u2019s tough-guy rhetoric, including comparing himself to the Incredible Hulk, will not endear him to female voters. \u201cI think they see him as a buffoon and somebody who doesn\u2019t understand people, but also doesn\u2019t care about the things that lots of women care about,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think women want to be governed by the Hulk. They don\u2019t.\u201d And she argued that Johnson \u2013 with the aid of his key adviser, Dominic Cummings \u2013 was deliberately styling himself as a political \u201cstrongman\u201d in the mould of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe have all these strong men in politics \u2013 whether it\u2019s Brazil, or the Philippines, or Trump, or Putin. They\u2019re all big men: it\u2019s let\u2019s look up to them, don\u2019t be afraid, they\u2019re looking after things. It\u2019s so fundamentally anti-democratic. And Boris seems to be modelling himself on that.\u201d In his Mirror interview, McDonnell also said that should Labour succeed in defeating Johnson in an election but fail to win a parliamentary majority it would not enter a coalition. \u201cWe\u2019ll not do it with any of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go in, we\u2019ll get a majority government, if we don\u2019t get a majority government we\u2019ll go in as a minority party government. We\u2019ll implement the manifesto. If any of those minor parties refuse to support us we\u2019ll go back to the people.\u201d",

Of course you\u2019re probably not a professional studio designer, and you almost certainly won\u2019t spend more than a few seconds on the task, so you might have accepted a few lazy cliches and tired stereotypes. I\u2019m wagering there was a lot of cherry blossom involved, a bonsai tree or two, perhaps some paper lanterns and a view of Mount Fuji. Well that image in your head is the ITV World Cup studio. They gave the Great Wave a wide berth and shirked the sushi, but otherwise it\u2019s all there.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/20/japan-overcome-dogged-russia-win-opening-rugby-world-cup-match\">Japan open Rugby World Cup by overcoming dogged Russia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But if ITV has played safe with the studio, its choice of theme music has come way out of left field. Unlike, say, in 2007, when it simply used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by a supergroup featuring Katherine Jenkins, Bryn Terfel, Lesley Garrett and others) or in 2011, when they used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Hayley Westenra) or for that matter in 2015, when they used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Paloma Faith), this time they shunned the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Kiyoe Yoshioka) in favour of their own specially-commissioned accompaniment (a version of World in Union by Emeli Sand\u00e9).

This dojo is, he explains, \u201cour demonstration area, where we\u2019re going to be illustrating some of the important points of the game, especially for those of you who aren\u2019t regular rugby-watchers\u201d. Jonny Wilkinson, Sam Warburton and Brian O\u2019Driscoll proceed to put on an extremely complicated exposition on the art of tackling and the rules that govern it. \u201cIt\u2019s all about understanding what a wrap actually entails,\u201d concludes O\u2019Driscoll. \u201cYou must wrap with your tackling shoulder.\u201d Those who aren\u2019t regular rugby-watchers, and for whom a wrap more commonly entails a visit to the sandwich aisle in Tesco, are unlikely to be significantly wiser.</p> \n<p>The opening ceremony is not a classic of the genre. Since the invention of miraculous enormous pitch-covering floor-screens it has become too easy to avoid the complex retellings of the history of sport through the medium of folk dancing which were once a staple of such occasions in favour of simply showing some video, which is diverting enough but not really in the spirit. Still, commentator Miles Harrison gets to deliver a few classic lines \u2013 \u201cA rugby ball becomes a seed of light spreading around the world\u201d \u2013 so our time was not totally wasted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ed70b45d515e10c18d4593c1afc8071ea57346c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ed70b45d515e10c18d4593c1afc8071ea57346c/0_0_1935_1093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rugby World Cup dojo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"565\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The art of tackling was demonstrated in a hidden annexe to the main studio modelled on a dojo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV Sport</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ceremony concludes when an area of miracle floor-screen, having already transformed into Mount Fuji, splits open to reveal Richie McCaw waving the Webb Ellis Cup. A few minutes later ITV returns to the stadium for a chat with the former Wales international Shane Williams. \u201cYou can hear behind us now,\u201d he says, gesturing to the crowd, \u201cthe rugby hasn\u2019t even kicked off, the opening ceremony hasn\u2019t kicked off, and they\u2019re already having a party.\u201d It may have been expedient to pre-record this segment, and convenient not to mention they had done so, but they could at least have used some of the time that bought them to insist Williams find something less confusing to say.</p> \n<p>Williams is exposed again with the game barely five minutes old, as he describes Will Tupou completely failing to catch the ball and thus allowing Russia to snaffle an early try. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who\u2019s under this,\u201d he expert-analyses, \u201cbut he gets nowhere near it, does he?\u201d That slight mis-step apart, the game \u2013 unlike Tupou\u2019s catch \u2013 is largely well handled. The hosts run out easy and popular victors, and attention instantly turns to Saturday and the mouth-watering meeting of South Africa and New Zealand.</p> \n<p>In ITV\u2019s closing moments Bryan Habana, the former Springbok wing, is asked for his thoughts on that game. \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure we get the traffic in early because there might be quite a few cars going to that stadium,\u201d he says. That is literally all Habana has to say on perhaps the tie of the pool stage. And so ends ITV\u2019s first test of the tournament, a few hours with no car crashes but perhaps just the occasional snarl-up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Close your eyes and design, in the realm of your imagination, a Japan-themed TV studio. Come back whenever you\u2019re ready. Of course you\u2019re probably not a professional studio designer, and you almost certainly won\u2019t spend more than a few seconds on the task, so you might have accepted a few lazy cliches and tired stereotypes. I\u2019m wagering there was a lot of cherry blossom involved, a bonsai tree or two, perhaps some paper lanterns and a view of Mount Fuji. Well that image in your head is the ITV World Cup studio. They gave the Great Wave a wide berth and shirked the sushi, but otherwise it\u2019s all there. But if ITV has played safe with the studio, its choice of theme music has come way out of left field. Unlike, say, in 2007, when it simply used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by a supergroup featuring Katherine Jenkins, Bryn Terfel, Lesley Garrett and others) or in 2011, when they used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Hayley Westenra) or for that matter in 2015, when they used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Paloma Faith), this time they shunned the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Kiyoe Yoshioka) in favour of their own specially-commissioned accompaniment (a version of World in Union by Emeli Sand\u00e9). This is revolutionary, in its way. Another surprise follows halfway through the opening programme, when presenter Mark Pougatch reveals a hitherto hidden annexe to the main studio. This dojo is, he explains, \u201cour demonstration area, where we\u2019re going to be illustrating some of the important points of the game, especially for those of you who aren\u2019t regular rugby-watchers\u201d. Jonny Wilkinson, Sam Warburton and Brian O\u2019Driscoll proceed to put on an extremely complicated exposition on the art of tackling and the rules that govern it. \u201cIt\u2019s all about understanding what a wrap actually entails,\u201d concludes O\u2019Driscoll. \u201cYou must wrap with your tackling shoulder.\u201d Those who aren\u2019t regular rugby-watchers, and for whom a wrap more commonly entails a visit to the sandwich aisle in Tesco, are unlikely to be significantly wiser. The opening ceremony is not a classic of the genre. Since the invention of miraculous enormous pitch-covering floor-screens it has become too easy to avoid the complex retellings of the history of sport through the medium of folk dancing which were once a staple of such occasions in favour of simply showing some video, which is diverting enough but not really in the spirit. Still, commentator Miles Harrison gets to deliver a few classic lines \u2013 \u201cA rugby ball becomes a seed of light spreading around the world\u201d \u2013 so our time was not totally wasted. The ceremony concludes when an area of miracle floor-screen, having already transformed into Mount Fuji, splits open to reveal Richie McCaw waving the Webb Ellis Cup. A few minutes later ITV returns to the stadium for a chat with the former Wales international Shane Williams. \u201cYou can hear behind us now,\u201d he says, gesturing to the crowd, \u201cthe rugby hasn\u2019t even kicked off, the opening ceremony hasn\u2019t kicked off, and they\u2019re already having a party.\u201d It may have been expedient to pre-record this segment, and convenient not to mention they had done so, but they could at least have used some of the time that bought them to insist Williams find something less confusing to say. Williams is exposed again with the game barely five minutes old, as he describes Will Tupou completely failing to catch the ball and thus allowing Russia to snaffle an early try. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who\u2019s under this,\u201d he expert-analyses, \u201cbut he gets nowhere near it, does he?\u201d That slight mis-step apart, the game \u2013 unlike Tupou\u2019s catch \u2013 is largely well handled. The hosts run out easy and popular victors, and attention instantly turns to Saturday and the mouth-watering meeting of South Africa and New Zealand. In ITV\u2019s closing moments Bryan Habana, the former Springbok wing, is asked for his thoughts on that game. \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure we get the traffic in early because there might be quite a few cars going to that stadium,\u201d he says. That is literally all Habana has to say on perhaps the tie of the pool stage. And so ends ITV\u2019s first test of the tournament, a few hours with no car crashes but perhaps just the occasional snarl-up.",

John-Lee Osborne, 27, bombarded the woman with more than 4,000 messages over a three-month period from four fake characters he had created. Through the fake characters Osborne convinced the woman that if she did not have sex with him, he would be kidnapped, beaten, raped and imprisoned. Osborne claimed he was also being forced into sex with the woman \u2013 a stranger \u2013 against his will, insisting that they were being filmed and listened to by would-be kidnappers. The former trainee sapper with the Royal Engineers was convicted of 15 charges of raping the woman following a trial at Bristol crown court. Judge Mark Horton jailed Osborne for 18 years and ordered him to serve a further five years on licence for the \u201cruthless\u201d offences. \u201cThis case represents a very disturbing development in the use of social media,\u201d the judge told Osborne, of Aust, near Bristol. \u201cYou used and developed applications and services available to you through the internet, social media and dark web to orchestrate what effectively became a weapon in your hands to establish and achieve the emotional and physical control of your victim.

My best tip is to get the table in the corner \u2013 you get dual-aspect views that way.

It\u2019s all plot and no insight. The one pleasure I took in it was the glorious precision of Aunt Lydia\u2019s voice. As for the rest of it: this seemed to be the work of a novelist overly impressed with her own cleverness, and so very lacking in heart.

      "body": "<p>An artificial dune of nearly 2m cubic metres of sand has been created on the Norfolk coast in an innovative approach to slowing coastal erosion.</p> <p>In the \u00a320m sandscaping scheme, enough sand to fill one and a half Wembley stadiums has been dredged from existing North Sea seabed extraction sites off Great Yarmouth and ferried to the rapidly eroding coastline beside the large gas terminal at Bacton.</p> <p>Nearly four miles (6km) of coastline has been replenished with new sand, deposited up to seven metres deep in places in an irregular form so the wind can create dunes to buffer the soft sandy cliffs. Although the sand is expected to erode and move with storms and currents, the project\u2019s engineers say it will buy 15 to 20 more years for a coastline where seaside communities are predicted to have to move inland later this century because of rising seas caused by the climate crisis.</p> <p>Villages to the south of Bacton have blamed increased erosion on the concrete sea defences around the gas terminal. These have prevented the natural movement of sediment from sandy cliffs drifting southwards to replenish neighbouring beaches.</p> <p>The new mobile defences are calculated to work with the longshore drift which will carry the sand southwards where it will protect other coastal villages that are increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis.</p> <p>It is the first scheme of its kind outside the Netherlands where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/19/floods-dutch-britain-netherlands-climatechange\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/19/floods-dutch-britain-netherlands-climatechange\">Zandmotor</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/19/floods-dutch-britain-netherlands-climatechange\"> project</a> used 10 times as much sand to protect a half-mile stretch of coastline in south Holland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762010f3f665c33f1cdd510182fbd5ab03b95ace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/762010f3f665c33f1cdd510182fbd5ab03b95ace/0_263_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A digger on the Norfolk coast moving sand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sand is deposited up to seven metres in places so the wind can create natural dunes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Taylor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dutch engineering company that designed the project has identified up to 20 coastal locations where sandscaping could be used, including Lincolnshire and the shingle coast at Aldeburgh in Suffolk.

      "bodyText": "An artificial dune of nearly 2m cubic metres of sand has been created on the Norfolk coast in an innovative approach to slowing coastal erosion. In the \u00a320m sandscaping scheme, enough sand to fill one and a half Wembley stadiums has been dredged from existing North Sea seabed extraction sites off Great Yarmouth and ferried to the rapidly eroding coastline beside the large gas terminal at Bacton. Nearly four miles (6km) of coastline has been replenished with new sand, deposited up to seven metres deep in places in an irregular form so the wind can create dunes to buffer the soft sandy cliffs. Although the sand is expected to erode and move with storms and currents, the project\u2019s engineers say it will buy 15 to 20 more years for a coastline where seaside communities are predicted to have to move inland later this century because of rising seas caused by the climate crisis. Villages to the south of Bacton have blamed increased erosion on the concrete sea defences around the gas terminal. These have prevented the natural movement of sediment from sandy cliffs drifting southwards to replenish neighbouring beaches. The new mobile defences are calculated to work with the longshore drift which will carry the sand southwards where it will protect other coastal villages that are increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis. It is the first scheme of its kind outside the Netherlands where the Zandmotor project used 10 times as much sand to protect a half-mile stretch of coastline in south Holland. The Dutch engineering company that designed the project has identified up to 20 coastal locations where sandscaping could be used, including Lincolnshire and the shingle coast at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. The company is currently discussing with Cornwall county council a potential sandscaping solution in Penzance where coastal erosion threatens the railway line. Jaap Flikweert, the coastal management adviser for Royal HaskoningDHV, said the Norfolk project was \u201ca little nephew of Zandmotor\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s less radical and it looks like a big, slightly more curvy beach nourishment scheme \u2026 it sticks out less from the shoreline but this is the best concept for the clients,\u201d he said. Local people at Walcott in Norfolk \u2013 where the 2013 storms wrecked homes \u2013 welcomed the scheme but pointed to the loss of 1 metre of sand from the lower part of the beach since it was placed there in August. \u201cA lot of it seems to have disappeared already,\u201d said Ken Crowe. \u201cI hope it does what it set out to do. Time will tell.\u201d \u201cPeople say the beach used to be like this 60 years ago,\u201d said Cathy Kerby. \u201cIt\u2019s improved the beach for everyone \u2026 we trust the experts know what they are doing and it will work.\u201d According to Flikweert, some sand will be moved by the tides and currents and will disappear on to offshore sand banks in the winter but is expected to return in the summer. \u201cThat\u2019s the dynamic of the beach. Of course it looks worrying, especially for local people, but that\u2019s how it works.\u201d The Zandmotor scheme in south Holland has surpassed initial expectations. The natural sea defence was expected to last for 20 years but a recent analysis suggested it could last twice as long. The Bacton project caused controversy in the spring when netting placed on the cliffs prevented returning sand martins from nesting in their regular holes. However, according to Natural England which monitored the sand martins, the birds dug new nest holes nearby and enjoyed a successful nesting season with as many birds as before. The new sand is also expected to provide habitat for shore-nesting birds such as ringed plover. Two-thirds of the \u00a320m British scheme has been funded by the owners of Bacton gas terminal \u2013 including Shell \u2013 with \u00a35m from the Environment Agency and additional funding from councils. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: \u201cThe climate crisis requires innovation and collaboration between countries, organisations, sectors and communities. The Bacton to Walcott scheme is a model for other climate resilience projects, protecting key national infrastructure while also delivering added coastal protection to the local villages.\u201d The Bacton gas terminal brings ashore 20% of the UK\u2019s gas needs and is designated critical national infrastructure.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s going for it? One thousand feet up in the clouds (OK, drizzle), with barely a street not at a 45-degree angle, Buxton is a town built like a fitness class. Work that body. It\u2019s been a spot encouraging the restitution of health for centuries. The Romans spotted the Jacuzzi-warm water bubbling out of the hills, awfully good for settling the tum; but it was the Georgians who turned Buxton into the Bath-of-the-north, with columns, crescents, domes and, if they\u2019d been invented then, neoclassical hot tubs, too. After a few years in the doldrums, today\u2019s hankering for wellbeing and hen-do spa parties has put a spring back in its step (no pun intended). It remains a place thoroughly good for mind, body and soul, with its elegant streetscape and refined arts scene. There are enough trees and countryside for a forest bath, and enough spas and sou\u2019westerlies for a more watery soak. The result being that Buxtonians are as chilled and zen as a Buddhist monk, as trim and hench as Joe Wicks, with the lungs of a Nepalese Sherpa, the skin of a newborn babe and digestion as regular as a Swiss train. Right? The case against Rainy. And when it\u2019s not rainy, cloudy. And when it\u2019s not cloudy, misty. And when it\u2019s not misty... you get the picture. Well connected?

The row was sparked by a British demand that the EU\u2019s negotiating team treat a long-awaited cache of documents outlining the UK\u2019s latest ideas as \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s government property\u201d. Whitehall told the European commission team that the three \u201cconfidential\u201d papers should not be distributed to Brexit delegates representing the EU\u2019s 27 other member states. Sources in Brussels said that in response the point was made forcefully to the British negotiating team that all proposals would need to be made available for the EU\u2019s capitals to analyse for talks to progress. With just six weeks to go until 31 October when the UK is due to leave the EU, there is despair in Brussels at the state of the talks, with the latest ideas seen as \u201cmore of the same\u201d from Downing Street.

Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport. \u201cCities are changing fast \u2013 and so are solutions for mobility,\u201d says Jaanaki Momaya, general manager at Lime UK, the UK operation of the US-based dockless travel startup. \u201cMore than 75% of the European population now live in cities, and as populations grow, more people are embracing the sharing economy.\u201d Since Lime launched in June 2017, more than 15 million people have signed up to use 100% carbon-free, affordable and easily accessible electric bikes and scooters through this app. With more than 65m rides globally, Lime has eliminated more than 20m miles of car travel and more than 8,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. Smart technology has been key to its growth in more than 25 countries and across five continents. By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.

All can be booked through Trainline\u2019s app or website.</p> <h2><strong>1. The Iron Road to the Isles</strong></h2> <p><strong>Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort William<br></strong>If you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.</p> <p><strong>Getting to Glasgow:</strong><em> you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).</em></p> <p><strong>Typical journey time:</strong><em> Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1356cbaf154631fdc399475dfd674d6c6a35d19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1356cbaf154631fdc399475dfd674d6c6a35d19f/0_0_3006_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruined castle in the Rhineland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruined castle in the Rhineland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pavlemarjanovic/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A ruined castle in the Rhineland</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>2. The Italian Riviera</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)<br></strong>Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.</p> <p><strong>Getting to Nice:</strong> <em>take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du Nord/Paris Gare de Lyon.</em></p> <p><strong>Typical journey time:</strong> <em>6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia and/or Genova.</em></p> <h2><strong>3. Over the Alps in Austria</strong></h2> <p><strong>Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering Pass<br></strong>This trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.</p> <p><strong>To get to Vienna:</strong><em> take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.</em></p> <p><strong>Typical journey time:</strong><em> Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6cc5b38528d90b389d7befa781e1d317ee9c14f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc5b38528d90b389d7befa781e1d317ee9c14f3/0_0_2127_1409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ribblehead ViaductRibbleshead Viaduct Train line countryside\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yorkshire\u2019s Ribblehead viaduct.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary T Naughton/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Ribblehead viaduct</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>4. The Yorkshire Highlands</strong></h2> <p><strong>Leeds to Carlisle via Settle<br></strong>It has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.</p> <p><strong>Getting to Leeds: </strong><em>there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.</em></p> <p><strong>Typical journey time: </strong><em>Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.</em></p> <h2><strong>5. Castles of the Rhine, Germany</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel-smarter/2019/sep/20/planes-trains-and-automobiles-which-is-the-most-sustainable-way-to-travel\">Planes, trains and automobiles \u2013 which is the most sustainable way to travel?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Cologne to Mainz<br></strong>Fancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge \u2013 only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains \u2013 so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don\u2019t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles \u2013 whether real, mock or ruined \u2013 and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.</p> <p><strong>To get to Cologne:</strong><em> take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.</em></p> <p><strong>Typical journey time:</strong><em> Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.</em></p> <p><em>Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Ticket to ride<br></strong>It is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

The Iron Road to the Isles Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort William If you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides. Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain). Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct. A ruined castle in the Rhineland 2. The Italian Riviera Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy) Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre. Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du Nord/Paris Gare de Lyon. Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia and/or Genova. 3. Over the Alps in Austria Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering Pass This trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey. To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt. Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct. The Ribblehead viaduct 4. The Yorkshire Highlands Leeds to Carlisle via Settle It has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed. Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London. Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct. 5. Castles of the Rhine, Germany Cologne to Mainz Fancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge \u2013 only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains \u2013 so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don\u2019t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles \u2013 whether real, mock or ruined \u2013 and pretty villages with half-timbered houses. To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels. Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes. Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose. Ticket to ride It is easy to book the train for your next adventure. With Trainline, you instantly get prices, times and tickets for journeys in and across 45 countries. World Car-Free Day is on 22 September, so get booking.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING THIS WEEK</strong></h2> <p>In the queue waiting on the Enough\u2019s Enough, You\u2019ve All Had Your Fun But This Is Getting Beyond A Joke Now rank, there are quite a few big clubs ahead of Manchester United. Nasty Leeds, for example, who have been out of the top division for 15 years. Or Nottingham Forest, two-time European champions who haven\u2019t seen the sunny uplands since the turn of the millennium. Or Newcastle United, without a domestic trophy since the Harold Macmillan years. Or seventies European powerhouses Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, who have just lost 4-0 at home in Big Vase to a team called RZ Pellets, named after a company that produces industrial quantities of pellets, though not as many as Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach did on Thursday night by the looks of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/19/manchester-united-astana-europa-league-match-report\">Mason Greenwood\u2019s first Manchester United goal earns win over Astana</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, United\u2019s woes have been well documented, so that must count for something. Right? And great news! Because it appears the biggest behemoth in English football is finally rising from its slumber after a whopping 849 days without a major trophy. Admittedly this time last week, everyone was sharpening the knives for poor old Ole, who would have been under some serious pressure had Leicester done a number on them at Old Trafford, at least that\u2019s what everyone was blethering on about. But after a shaky 1-0 win, followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/19/manchester-united-astana-europa-league-match-report\">another uncertain 1-0 victory</a> over Astana, the mood music is markedly less funereal. Not least because 17-year-old prodigy Mason Greenwood became the club\u2019s youngest ever scorer in Europe, no small feat given United haven\u2019t been too shabby in promoting their kids in the past. He\u2019s ahead of Marcus Rashford and George Best, for goodness sake. Georgie Best!</p> <p>Greenwood\u2019s strike has of course caused the folk in United\u2019s boardroom to completely lose the run of themselves, and they\u2019ve already slapped a bumper new contract on the table for the young man. It\u2019s another example of the club\u2019s considered approach to business, long admired ever since the calm negotiations to land Marouane Fellani, all the way through to the ice-cool haggling over Harry Maguire, and everything in between. To be fair, Greenwood is extremely highly rated by his manager, who knows a thing or two about scoring goals, so a pay hike looks like money well spent and a no-brainer for the club. In any case, Ed Woodward can\u2019t faff about over details, he\u2019s got to start making enquiries about James Maddison and Europe\u2019s newest scoring sensation Erling Braut Haaland, a player modelled by Ole at Molde no less.

Sure enough he was there, couldn\u2019t have been more friendly and signed a personalised message to the boys.

      "bodyText": "THE WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING THIS WEEK In the queue waiting on the Enough\u2019s Enough, You\u2019ve All Had Your Fun But This Is Getting Beyond A Joke Now rank, there are quite a few big clubs ahead of Manchester United. Nasty Leeds, for example, who have been out of the top division for 15 years. Or Nottingham Forest, two-time European champions who haven\u2019t seen the sunny uplands since the turn of the millennium. Or Newcastle United, without a domestic trophy since the Harold Macmillan years. Or seventies European powerhouses Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, who have just lost 4-0 at home in Big Vase to a team called RZ Pellets, named after a company that produces industrial quantities of pellets, though not as many as Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach did on Thursday night by the looks of it. Still, United\u2019s woes have been well documented, so that must count for something. Right? And great news! Because it appears the biggest behemoth in English football is finally rising from its slumber after a whopping 849 days without a major trophy. Admittedly this time last week, everyone was sharpening the knives for poor old Ole, who would have been under some serious pressure had Leicester done a number on them at Old Trafford, at least that\u2019s what everyone was blethering on about. But after a shaky 1-0 win, followed by another uncertain 1-0 victory over Astana, the mood music is markedly less funereal. Not least because 17-year-old prodigy Mason Greenwood became the club\u2019s youngest ever scorer in Europe, no small feat given United haven\u2019t been too shabby in promoting their kids in the past. He\u2019s ahead of Marcus Rashford and George Best, for goodness sake. Georgie Best! Greenwood\u2019s strike has of course caused the folk in United\u2019s boardroom to completely lose the run of themselves, and they\u2019ve already slapped a bumper new contract on the table for the young man. It\u2019s another example of the club\u2019s considered approach to business, long admired ever since the calm negotiations to land Marouane Fellani, all the way through to the ice-cool haggling over Harry Maguire, and everything in between. To be fair, Greenwood is extremely highly rated by his manager, who knows a thing or two about scoring goals, so a pay hike looks like money well spent and a no-brainer for the club. In any case, Ed Woodward can\u2019t faff about over details, he\u2019s got to start making enquiries about James Maddison and Europe\u2019s newest scoring sensation Erling Braut Haaland, a player modelled by Ole at Molde no less. Oh dear, Ed\u2019s going to get over-excited, isn\u2019t he. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE! Join Rob Smyth from 8pm for hot MBM coverage of Southampton 0-0 Bournemouth. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI signed just in time. But I arrived here with the thought that if I sign, I could go back to get my stuff I needed. But the gaffer really wanted me to stay for the first game. I had no boots, so I did two training sessions and the first game with somebody else\u2019s. I don\u2019t even know whose they were\u201d \u2013 Dennis Praet on being pitched straight into action at Leicester as he gets his chat on with Stuart James. FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe Fiver passing judgment on the sartorial choices of style icon Zinedine Zidane (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) strikes me as quite rich. Admittedly, the skinniest of trousers have not the same homely appeal as Tin-stained joggers, but if the aim is to score points with Big Paper\u2019s fashion department, Weird Uncle Fiver may be holding his breath for some time\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman. \u201cRe: contacting managers (Fiver letters passim). Years ago when I was a love-struck teenager, the nephews of the girl I was dating were massive Queen\u2019s Celtic fans. Knowing where Jock Stein lived (I told you it was years ago), I thought I would get bonus points if I got his autograph. Boldly, I knocked on his door, which was answered by his wife, only to be told he was away doing managerial things, but if I called at the same time the following day, he would be available. Sure enough he was there, couldn\u2019t have been more friendly and signed a personalised message to the boys. He was such a pleasant person, nothing was too much trouble and he even took it well when he asked if I wanted an autograph and I told him I was a Pope\u2019s O\u2019Rangers fan\u201d \u2013 Grahame Wilkinson. \u201cReece Neale\u2019s tumbleweed (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) definitely had a hairy panic on, talking of which \u2026 the tumbleweed to end all tumbleweed\u201d \u2013 Peter Fosse. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Grahame Wilkinson. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS World players\u2019 union Fifpro says it is time to stop matches being played in extreme heat, urging Fifa to set a temperature limit before postponing them. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to give employees this kind of bad environment because they cannot perform to their optimal level and this is also not fair on the spectators who want to see the players at their best,\u201d said medical officer Vincent Gouttebarge. Big Dan Levy may be getting Spurs to refinance \u00a3637m of their stadium\u2019s debt, but he isn\u2019t about to go wild in the aisles any time soon. \u201cWe could have easily spent more money on players,\u201d he cheered. \u201cWho knows if that would have bought us more success or not. The right approach is to build from the bottom up. There is no quick fix to becoming a much more significant global club.\u201d After Arsenal won another game which was low on jeopardy, albeit impressively at Eintracht Frankfurt, Bukayo Saka has been talking up coach Freddie Ljungberg. \u201cHe was teaching me some tactics but I can\u2019t quite remember what he was saying because he does give me a lot of information,\u201d tooted Saka. \u201cHe\u2019s been a big part in my progress.\u201d Spanish football suits have wasted little time in Ansu Fati going big with Barcelona to dish him out a passport. And Newcastle boss Bernard Cribbins is planning to unleash Andy Carroll against Brighton on Saturday. \u201cCertainly of his type, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been anybody better in the last eight, 10 years when he\u2019s been playing,\u201d he honked. \u201cA fit Andy Carroll is going to be huge going forward, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? Someone else getting their chat on: it\u2019s QPR\u2019s Mark Warburton with Ewan Murray. Watford haven\u2019t beaten Manchester City since Thatcher\u2019s reign. Barry Glendenning chews on that and the existence of bogey teams in general. This weekend\u2019s Premier League action: 10 things to look out for.

Sundar Pichai said the clean energy deal will include 18 separate agreements to supply Google with electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. The search engine\u2019s green energy portfolio will grow by 40%, giving the company access to an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean electricity \u2013 the equivalent capacity of a million solar rooftops, the company said. Google has become the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity by matching the huge energy demand of its global operations and data centres with the electricity generated by renewable energy projects.

      "body": "<h2>The beginning</h2> <p><strong>Aaron Sorkin (creator and writer) </strong>I dreamed up the show at a time when you didn\u2019t talk about politics and religion at the dinner table and you definitely didn\u2019t do it on TV. We talked about both in the first 10 minutes. I didn\u2019t think there was going to be a second episode.</p> <p><strong>John Wells (executive producer) </strong>Not many people thought it was the right time for a political drama. It was around the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/monica-lewinsky\">the Monica Lewinsky scandal</a>. I think the scandal ended up being very useful, because we could remind the audience of what kind of integrity should be expected of our leaders. </p> <p><strong>Richard Schiff (communications director Toby Ziegler) </strong>When I auditioned, I saw Allison Janney sitting there. I thought: \u201cOh my God, if they cast her, these guys know what they\u2019re doing. But they\u2019ll never be smart enough to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d543da874c1df2a17883b73dd768cdb9c1d48f60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d543da874c1df2a17883b73dd768cdb9c1d48f60/0_193_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The cast were like my family\u2019 \u2026 Allison Janney as CJ.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The cast were like my family\u2019 \u2026 Allison Janney as CJ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Feld/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/26/television\">Allison Janney</a> (press secretary CJ Cregg) </strong>I kept seeing Richard at my callbacks. Neither of us thought we\u2019d get the roles. I wasn\u2019t even sure I was ever going to do television. So to then get the part was mind-blowing. These people almost became more my family than my family.</p> <p><strong>Wells </strong>We were already picking a difficult subject. Then NBC started worrying that the cast weren\u2019t attractive enough. Would viewers want to see these people? It is useful in those conversations to have a movie star like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rob-lowe\">Rob Lowe</a> [deputy comms director Sam Seaborn] on board.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/27/features.weekend\">Stockard Channing</a> (First Lady Abbey Bartlet)</strong> I was about to go on a five-day hiking trip in a remote part of Canada when I got the call offering me a part. I had to get straight on a plane to Los Angeles. So I arrived there in full hiking gear and boots. It was 95 degrees and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, other than I had to wear an evening gown, which scared the crap out of me.</p> <p><strong>Wells</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/18/martin-sheen-interview-apocalypse-now\">Martin Sheen</a> was only partially interested to begin with. We told him Jed Bartlet would only be in six episodes. Then, after the pilot, everybody wanted Martin in every episode.</p> <p><strong>Channing</strong> I had never met Martin before. When I arrived for the first shoot, he was outside this mansion in white tie having a cigarette break with 500 extras all dressed up. Just before our first take, I said: \u201cHi, so how long have we been married?\u201d He said: \u201cOh, I think 25, 30 years.\u201d Then they said: \u201cAction!\u201d After take one, he said: \u201cAnd we have a grandchild!\u201d \u201cA grandchild?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you mean we have a grandchild?\u201d And they called \u201cAction!\u201d The days were like that.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/22/lily-tomlin-grandma-interview-sexism-ageism-isis\">Lily Tomlin</a> (executive assistant Deborah Fiderer)</strong> Martin is a darling man. Before every scene, he would take off his real wedding ring, bless it and put it in a drawer.</p> <h2>Racist mail</h2> <p><strong>Dul\u00e9 Hill (the president\u2019s personal aide, Charlie Young)</strong> I only had a month and a half of rent money left when I got the job. The NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) had had an issue with the whole cast on the show being white. Thankfully, they spoke up, thankfully the entire team understood, and thankfully they made some changes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1f9bcfc4641e4a0b84e9b51cf7f28775cdf4163\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1f9bcfc4641e4a0b84e9b51cf7f28775cdf4163/225_209_2725_1635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Controversy \u2026 the affair between Zoey and Charlie prompted outraged mail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Controversy \u2026 the affair between Zoey and Charlie prompted hate mail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Haston/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sorkin</strong> After an episode in the first season where Zoey Bartlet (the president\u2019s daughter, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/elisabeth-moss\">Elisabeth Moss</a>) kissed Charlie, I got a letter from an outraged woman that read: \u201cLincoln only meant to free them \u2013 he didn\u2019t mean to glorify them.\u201d I went back and forth about whether to show it to Dul\u00e9. It felt wrong not to, so I took the letter to his trailer. He taped it on the wall. It was the first of many.</p> <p><strong>Hill</strong> I can vividly recall Aaron reading those letters out loud at read-throughs. It was like Zoey was the real president\u2019s daughter. The idea that people could respond that way really shocked me.</p> <p><strong>Sorkin</strong> I already knew there would be an assassination attempt at the end of the first season, but the hate mail gave me an idea: they weren\u2019t shooting at Bartlet \u2013 they were shooting at Charlie.</p> <h2>The 9/11 quandary</h2> <p><strong>Channing</strong> I was on the set early on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\">9/11</a>. I was in the makeup trailer and they had the TV on when the Washington stuff happened. Everyone was sent home. Everyone was hysterical.</p> <p><strong>Sorkin</strong> The next day, I asked NBC to postpone our season three premiere indefinitely. Josh and Donna flirting, CJ fretting over her role in the cover-up of the president\u2019s multiple sclerosis, Bartlet\u2019s re-election campaign \u2013 it would all seem such small potatoes if it wasn\u2019t set against the same backdrop the rest of us were living through. The network wasn\u2019t able to, so I wrote the standalone episode <a href=\"https://westwing.fandom.com/wiki/Isaac_and_Ishmael\">Isaac and Ishmael</a>. We didn\u2019t mention 9/11 or Bin Laden, but there was a sense something terrible had happened. Looking back, I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.

My losing it usually had to do with Martin flubbing a line. The president\u2019s first scene \u2013 where he comes in and says, \u2018I am the Lord our God\u2019 \u2013 was this grand, beautiful entrance. He walked round the room, then tells the Christian right to get their fat asses out of his White House. He has a clown side: between every take, he would go to the catering table and stuff his face with chicken. There\u2019d be people trying to do his touch-ups and both his cheeks were full and he had grease all over his mouth. I\u2019d have to run to the next room to let out the laughter.</p> <p><strong>Janney</strong> Once Richard started laughing, it was trouble. Sometimes, on Air Force One, I would say, \u201cCome on, it\u2019s always a smooth ride. Let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s bumpy!\u201d So Richard and I would act like there was turbulence, which would set us off.</p> <p><strong>Schiff </strong>On Friday nights, we\u2019d all get giddy. One Friday, it was Allison\u2019s birthday and all of her friends came to the trailer. She showed off her lip-syncing talent and we all got involved with air guitars and air drums. Aaron came over at two in the morning to listen. That\u2019s how CJ ended up lip-syncing to The Jackal in one episode.</p> <p><strong>Whitford </strong>When we were doing the Christmas episode in the second year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/28/yo-yo-ma-bach-big-bird-and-me\">Yo-Yo Ma</a> walked into a room full of hundreds of extras and wanted us to hold and touch and play his $6m cello. In between takes, he started improvising and Dul\u00e9 \u2013 who is one of the best tap-dancers in the world \u2013 started tapping along.</p> <h2>Prince Andrew pops by</h2> <p><strong>Sorkin</strong> The most surreal moment involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-andrew\">Prince Andrew</a>. He was in LA and he\u2019d requested a tour of our set, so the British consulate set it up. In one part of the West Wing, the walls are decorated with framed photos of the president with world leaders and heads of state \u2013 the president with the pope etc. I was leading Prince Andrew down one of our hallways when I saw that he\u2019d stopped and was staring at a picture he couldn\u2019t figure out. It was Martin Sheen as President Bartlet engaged in a conversation with the prince\u2019s mother, the Queen. I got to tell him what Photoshop is.</p> <h2>Sorkin\u2019s departure</h2> <p><strong>Sorkin</strong> West Wing scripts weren\u2019t finished \u2013 they were confiscated. Tommy Schlamme (executive producer) would come into my office and say: \u201cPencils down.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Schiff </strong>I wanted Toby to be someone who didn\u2019t speak unless he had to.

He\u2019s had a bad rap for that \u2013 and I think it\u2019s unfair. <a href=\"https://westwing.fandom.com/wiki/The_Women_of_Qumar\">The Women of Qumar</a> was a key episode. I loved it any time CJ spoke truth to power or dressed down a four-star general. I long to be like that in real life.</p> <p><strong>Schiff</strong> Towards the end of his tenure, Aaron was late with scripts. Sometimes we wouldn\u2019t be able to shoot. And that\u2019s expensive. The pressure of becoming a factory is tough.</p> <p><strong>Malina</strong> When I learned Aaron was leaving, my jaw was on the floor. It was such a bomb. I remember Richard\u2019s voice breaking.</p> <p><strong>Whitford</strong> I cried like a baby.</p> <p><strong>Janney</strong> It felt like our parents were telling us they no longer wanted to be our parents.</p> <p><strong>Wells</strong> I didn\u2019t want Aaron to go but he was exhausted. Taking over was daunting. I called him and said: \u201cWhat was going to happen next? Because I have to write the second part of this two-parter after Zoey got kidnapped.\u201d He said: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6c705ba68837c2301a4e9a02a00b238e3fe8da7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6c705ba68837c2301a4e9a02a00b238e3fe8da7/0_117_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Spencer, centre, with Martin Sheen and Lily Tomlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The show died with him \u2026 John Spencer, centre, with Martin Sheen and Lily Tomlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitch Haddad/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Patriotism reclaimed</h2> <p><strong>Sorkin</strong> In popular culture, our leaders, by and large, are portrayed as either Machiavellian or dolts. I wanted our characters to be competent and committed, like the doctors and nurses on hospital shows and the detectives on crime shows. I wanted the show to be romantic and idealistic, but also quietly subversive. For an hour every week, I wanted to reclaim the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Schiff </strong>The first time we got invited to the correspondents\u2019 dinner in Washington DC, it was like Elvis had come back to Memphis! We were surrounded by hundreds of reporters, congressmen, senators and ambassadors who couldn\u2019t get enough of us. I missed a private meeting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\">President Clinton</a> because I couldn\u2019t get through the crowd.</p> <p><strong>Janney</strong> People would say \u201cMr President!

You admire Abigail Bartlet.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Hill </strong>They gave us a real motorcade in DC one time. For me and most of the cast, it was really exciting. Martin didn\u2019t like it at all. He thought we needed to never forget we were actors. </p> <p><strong>Tomlin</strong> In the last episode, when Matt Santos (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/21/barackobama.uselections2008\">Jimmy Smits</a>) is about to take over as president, I cried. </p> <p><strong>Wells</strong> Our political consultants all said a \u201cminority president\u201d was much more likely to be elected before a woman was.

      "bodyText": "The beginning Aaron Sorkin (creator and writer) I dreamed up the show at a time when you didn\u2019t talk about politics and religion at the dinner table and you definitely didn\u2019t do it on TV. We talked about both in the first 10 minutes. I didn\u2019t think there was going to be a second episode. John Wells (executive producer) Not many people thought it was the right time for a political drama. It was around the time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. I think the scandal ended up being very useful, because we could remind the audience of what kind of integrity should be expected of our leaders. Richard Schiff (communications director Toby Ziegler) When I auditioned, I saw Allison Janney sitting there. I thought: \u201cOh my God, if they cast her, these guys know what they\u2019re doing. But they\u2019ll never be smart enough to.\u201d Allison Janney (press secretary CJ Cregg) I kept seeing Richard at my callbacks. Neither of us thought we\u2019d get the roles. I wasn\u2019t even sure I was ever going to do television. So to then get the part was mind-blowing. These people almost became more my family than my family. Wells We were already picking a difficult subject. Then NBC started worrying that the cast weren\u2019t attractive enough. Would viewers want to see these people? It is useful in those conversations to have a movie star like Rob Lowe [deputy comms director Sam Seaborn] on board. Stockard Channing (First Lady Abbey Bartlet) I was about to go on a five-day hiking trip in a remote part of Canada when I got the call offering me a part. I had to get straight on a plane to Los Angeles. So I arrived there in full hiking gear and boots. It was 95 degrees and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, other than I had to wear an evening gown, which scared the crap out of me. Wells Martin Sheen was only partially interested to begin with. We told him Jed Bartlet would only be in six episodes. Then, after the pilot, everybody wanted Martin in every episode. Channing I had never met Martin before. When I arrived for the first shoot, he was outside this mansion in white tie having a cigarette break with 500 extras all dressed up. Just before our first take, I said: \u201cHi, so how long have we been married?\u201d He said: \u201cOh, I think 25, 30 years.\u201d Then they said: \u201cAction!\u201d After take one, he said: \u201cAnd we have a grandchild!\u201d \u201cA grandchild?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you mean we have a grandchild?\u201d And they called \u201cAction!\u201d The days were like that. Lily Tomlin (executive assistant Deborah Fiderer) Martin is a darling man. Before every scene, he would take off his real wedding ring, bless it and put it in a drawer. Racist mail Dul\u00e9 Hill (the president\u2019s personal aide, Charlie Young) I only had a month and a half of rent money left when I got the job. The NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) had had an issue with the whole cast on the show being white. Thankfully, they spoke up, thankfully the entire team understood, and thankfully they made some changes. Sorkin After an episode in the first season where Zoey Bartlet (the president\u2019s daughter, played by Elisabeth Moss) kissed Charlie, I got a letter from an outraged woman that read: \u201cLincoln only meant to free them \u2013 he didn\u2019t mean to glorify them.\u201d I went back and forth about whether to show it to Dul\u00e9. It felt wrong not to, so I took the letter to his trailer. He taped it on the wall. It was the first of many. Hill I can vividly recall Aaron reading those letters out loud at read-throughs. It was like Zoey was the real president\u2019s daughter. The idea that people could respond that way really shocked me. Sorkin I already knew there would be an assassination attempt at the end of the first season, but the hate mail gave me an idea: they weren\u2019t shooting at Bartlet \u2013 they were shooting at Charlie. The 9/11 quandary Channing I was on the set early on 9/11. I was in the makeup trailer and they had the TV on when the Washington stuff happened. Everyone was sent home. Everyone was hysterical. Sorkin The next day, I asked NBC to postpone our season three premiere indefinitely. Josh and Donna flirting, CJ fretting over her role in the cover-up of the president\u2019s multiple sclerosis, Bartlet\u2019s re-election campaign \u2013 it would all seem such small potatoes if it wasn\u2019t set against the same backdrop the rest of us were living through. The network wasn\u2019t able to, so I wrote the standalone episode Isaac and Ishmael. We didn\u2019t mention 9/11 or Bin Laden, but there was a sense something terrible had happened. Looking back, I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. Eighteen years on, I still don\u2019t have any better ideas. Joshua Malina (Will Bailey, various positions) It\u2019s a bold piece of television that addressed a national tragedy in a matter of weeks. And a lot of adults today say: \u201cI was young when it came out and it explained a lot to me.\u201d Channing After 9/11, security was tightened up at the studio. There were metal detectors to scan under the cars. Pranks and parties Sorkin Brad Whitford (deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman) and Dul\u00e9 enjoyed a practical joke, but when Joshua Malina joined, all bets were off. Hill Joshua once put a whole bunch of West Wing memorabilia in the trunk of Brad\u2019s car, then security stopped him on the way out. Malina It was low-level humour: leaving a piece of fish hidden in Allison\u2019s trailer, an onion here and there, tweaking the Post-its Brad would put up in his trailer to say: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the camera actually takes off weight.\u201d Schiff I was the worst offender of the giggle fit.

The train is crossing a bridge over the Thames at Maidenhead while people watch from the riverbank below, but it might be soaring to the stars as it pushes the limit of human speed. When Turner was born, in 1775, it took several days to cross the country. This painting registers his awe at the new age he has lived to see, when human beings can attain dizzying speeds of 30 miles an hour. \u2022 National Gallery, London Image of the week A hole in the Blenheim Palace floor where Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s \u00a35m solid-gold toilet stood before it was stolen in the early hours of Saturday.

However, the medicines are available privately and there have been at least 100 prescriptions, which cost up to \u00a34,000 a month. A watchdog ruled last month there was not yet enough evidence to prove medical cannabis can help those with severe epilepsy, and there have been calls for observational trials to help establish its widely reported benefits. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, said forcing families with sick children into a financially crippling situation was \u201cappalling\u201d. \u201cThe government needs to work with the NHS to find a way to get these children this life-transforming medicine not in weeks and months, but immediately.\u201d A DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cGovernment is urgently working with the health system, industry and researchers to improve the evidence base to provide clinicians with further support and guidance on prescribing where clinically appropriate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There hasn\u2019t been much reprieve for Thomas Cook shares, as customers, staff and shareholders worry about the company\u2019s future. The airline\u2019s share price is still down -19% at 3.62p The British Airlines Pilots Association union called for the government to intervene and stop banks from pulling support for Thomas Cook In non-airline news: The pound is trading lower after hitting two month highs against the US dollar overnight on Brexit deal hopes. They were buoyed European Commission president Jean-Claude Junker signalled a deal was still possible, but soon deflated Sterling is down -0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1317 and -0.4% versus the dollar at $1.2471 Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed it appointed Alison Rose as its new chief executive, becoming the first major UK bank to install a female boss at the head of the firm Brexit secretary Steve Barclay met with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator in Brussels, but moved no closer to securing a withdrawal deal as far as we can tell Have a great weekend. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. Shares in budget airlines Ryanair and easyJet are trading higher amid jitters over Thomas Cook\u2019s future: Ryanair shares are up +2.3% at \u20ac10.16 Easyjet shares are up +3.1% at \u00a310.60 Customers worried about their travel plans with Thomas Cook should check whether they booked directly with the firm and if they used a credit card. It could mean they\u2019re protected under the UK\u2019s Consumer Credit Act, if Thomas Cook does run into trouble. Alastair Douglas, chief executive of TotallyMoney explains: Providing the purchase was above \u00a3100 \u2014 and you used a credit card to book directly with Thomas Cook and not through a third-party booking site \u2014 you should be able to get your money back under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. Using a credit card responsibly and not spending beyond your means offers you a bit more protection, which can prove invaluable in situations such as this. The trouble is, many customers aren\u2019t sure what they\u2019re entitled to under Section 75. Lack of knowledge of these situations often leaves consumers out of pocket, thinking there\u2019s nothing to be done, when really that\u2019s not the case. If in doubt, the best thing to do is speak with your credit card provider. You might be surprised at what you could get back. However, those who booked though a third party \u2013 including online marketplaces or travel agents \u2013 won\u2019t be protected under the same rules. Wall Street has opened for trading, with major indices starting in positive territory: Dow is up up +0.15% S&amp;P 500 is up +0.16% Nasdaq is up +0.06% If the market was hoping for some progress out of Brexit secretary Steve Barclay\u2019s meeting in Brussels, there will surely be some disappointment. The comments coming out of the meeting suggest there was no further movement towards a deal. Barclay said: He believes a deal is possible with the EU A no-deal would be disruptive for both sides, no one wants to see a no-deal There is a common purpose in Dublin, London and Brussels to see a deal over the line They are getting into the detail of the talks, and that another technical meeting will be held next week Prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to meet the EU Council president Donald Tusk at the UN next week The pound was bolstered overnight following comments from European Commission president Jean-Claude Junker, who insisted that we can indeed have a Brexit withdrawal deal and that he wasn\u2019t tied to the backstop. But that sentiment could only buoy the pound, which hit a two-month high of $1.2576, for so long. Now the pound has drifted lower by around -0.36% to 1.2483 against the US dollar. Against the euro, sterling is at \u20ac1.1317. In other airline news, British Airways is offering customers the chance to rebook flights through the airline after a pilots strike scheduled for next week was cancelled. Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent Gwyn Topham has the details: British Airways will operate more than half its normal flight schedule next Friday after a strike by pilots was called off. Although BA had stopped selling tickets for 27 September and started cancelling bookings, it will merge some services and operate more than 400 flights on the day. It is also offering to rebook thousands of cancelled passengers. The airline emailed passengers on 12 September to confirm cancellations, just before a 14-day notice period when it would have been liable for additional compensation payments under EU regulation. A BA spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are offering all customers whose flights were cancelled due to next week\u2019s planned industrial action the option to rebook on to a British Airways flight, with a schedule of services to our daily destinations on 26, 27 and 28 September.\u201d You can read the full story here: Alex Brignall, a travel and leisure analyst at City equities broker Redburn, says the banks\u2019 demand for an extra \u00a3200m cushion could mean they\u2019re seeking a speedier resolution to Thomas Cook\u2019s financial woes \u2013 either through a rescue deal or another route: It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time. The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress. There are suggestions that banks withdrew their support for the Thomas Cook rescue deal after one of the non-lender partners in the deal did the same. Sky News correspondent Paul Kelso has tweeted a few details: We\u2019ve got a new story running on Thomas Cook, outlining the repercussions of the company\u2019s potential collapse, which could reportedly happen as early as this weekend. As Sean Farrell explains, the company\u2019s failure could put 20,000 jobs at risk, including about 9,000 in the UK. The Civil Aviation Authority, the government-backed regulator, would be forced to pick up the estimated \u00a3600m cost of bringing the 150,000 people home. The Department for Transport and the CAA have made preparations to bring stranded Thomas Cook passengers back to the UK, a plan known as Operation Matterhorn. You can read the full story here: The Department for Exiting the European Union is giving away few details on the meeting between Brexit secretary Steve Barclay and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier today. The Secretary of State will be meeting Michel Barnier this morning in Brussels. They are expected to take stock following the technical discussions between the PM\u2019s Europe Sherpa David Frost and Task Force 50. (Task Force 50 being the group responsible for coordinating the European Commission\u2019s work related to Brexit negotiations.) Thomas Cook shares, which are at a record low, have plunged 92% in the last year. That\u2019s a hefty slide. Graham Spooner, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: Although it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to investors in the group, the company reacted this morning to heightened media speculation by stating possible financial rescue could result in shareholders \u2018being diluted, with significant risk of no recovery\u2019. He adds: Investors are gambling on a bailout and there has been active two-way trading in the group, at least know the downside. Perhaps more consideration should be with those holidaymakers who have their bucket and spade packed or are already abroad and who now will fear the worse. The next few days could see the demise of a famous name and innovator in bringing travel to the masses. Customers are starting to worry about their flights with Thomas Cook, with some tweeting to the company about upcoming trips. But its customer service account is trying to assure consumers that its rescue package, if secured, will put the company on stronger footing. Not sure if that\u2019s the response travellers were looking for: Some pretty strong words from the British Airline Pilots Association union, which is insisting that prime minister Boris Johnson blocks UK banks from pulling the plug on Thomas Cook: It is appalling that banks that owe their very existence to handouts from the British taxpayer, show no allegiance to a great British company, Thomas Cook, when it needs help. This puts 9,000 good quality UK jobs needlessly at risk and puts an iconic British brand in jeopardy. The government has a say in this, owning one of the key banks and still with huge influence over the other. RBS and Lloyd\u2019s should be told by the Prime Minister to support Thomas Cook. If Thomas Cook goes into administration it will cost the taxpayer as much to repatriate holidaymakers as it would cost to save Thomas Cook; the Government sat on the sidelines wringing its hands when Monarch Airlines was let down by its financiers, this time Government needs to get a grip and do its bit to save Thomas Cook. Thomas Cook shares have fallen nearly 19% to trade at 3.63p this morning. There are worries that the company is on the brink, as it races to raise another \u00a3200m to help it stay afloat. It has been close to finalising a \u00a3900m rescue package, but lenders including RBS and Lloyds have now demanded the airline raise another \u00a3200m to ensure it can continue trading through the winter when customer bookings tend to slump. Thomas Cook has to secure the funding by next Friday. The company issued a statement this morning, confirming that discussions are underway over the final terms of the rescue package with shareholders, including its largest investor Chinese conglomerate Fosun. Market trading is underway in Europe, with most major bourses falling into the red: FTSE 100 is down -0.1% France\u2019s CAC 40 -0.1% Germany\u2019s DAX is down -0.1% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is a bright spot up 0.1% Royal Bank of Scotland has finally confirmed that the appointment of Alison Rose as its new boss, making her the first woman to run one of the UK\u2019s major banks. The announcement was so widely-expected that it would have been more of a shock if she hadn\u2019t been given the job. (To put this into context, rumours about the fact Rose was preparing to replace outgoing boss Ross McEwan have been circulating for more than a year.) The 49-year-old will take up her post on November 1 and will be paid a base salary of \u00a31.1m \u2013 which is \u00a3100,000 more than McEwan. RBS says this reflects the fact that McEwan\u2019s salary had not increased since 2013. But her pension pay has been set at 10% of salary, which is in line with the rest of the workforce as guided by the UK Corporate Governance Code. It means Rose will avoid the criticism lobbed at McEwan, who was granted pension pay worth 35% of his \u00a31m salary. It\u2019s worth noting that the pound is also up against the euro at \u20ac1.13. RBC\u2019s chief currency strategist Adam Cole says the probability of a no-deal Brexit has fallen to around 19% following Juncker\u2019s comments: GBP is this morning retesting highs made late in the North American session on the back of EU Commission President Junker\u2019s comment that \u201cI think we can have a deal\u201d and that he was ready to remove the current Irish backstop if the UK came up with an alternative way of guaranteeing no hard border that is just as robust. Cole adds: While this is a marked softening of the EU\u2019s line of the last few months, constructing an alternative in the 41 days that remain will be extremely challenging. Brexit Secretary Barclay meets with Barnier in Brussels today. With the UK bookies, the probability of no deal exit this year drifted slightly lower to 19% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After some dismal news from the OECD about the trajectory of UK growth yesterday afternoon, the pound got a bit of a boost on hopes of a Brexit deal overnight. Against the US dollar, sterling is now sitting at $1.2576 \u2013 its highest since mid-July. That\u2019s thanks to comments made by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. In an interview with Sky News, he insisted that \u201cwe can have a deal\u201d on Brexit and that he was doing everything he could to get there. Juncker also assured he did not have \u201can erotic relation\u201d to the Irish backstop. (Good to know?) Eyes now turn to Britain\u2019s Brexit minister Steve Barclay, who is set to meet with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels today. In corporate news, RBS has confirmed its worst-kept secret and appointed Alison Rose as its first female chief executive. It will also make her the first woman to run one of Britain\u2019s major high street banks. And after the the steady stream of data and central bank decisions earlier this week, the economic agenda is slim. Consider it a well-earned break.",

      "bodyText": "The government and the aviation watchdog are drawing up plans for the biggest ever UK peacetime repatriation if Thomas Cook collapses, with 150,000 British customers currently on holidays overseas with the travel company. Thomas Cook is holding last-minute talks to stave off a bankruptcy that could happen as soon as this weekend unless it secures \u00a3200m in extra funding. The Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) have made initial preparations to bring stranded passengers back to the UK, under a plan known as Operation Matterhorn. Britain\u2019s oldest package holiday company has held emergency talks to sell its Nordic airline and tour operating divisions in an attempt to raise money. Trade unions called on the government to step in, whether directly or by putting pressure on lenders that include state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland. On Friday night, a source dismissed reports that Thomas Cook was close to giving up hope of a private sector rescue deal. Sky News reported that the scenarios on the table had been scrapped and the final hope may be a government bailout. However, it cited a Whitehall source that said the chances of that happening were remote. The collapse of Thomas Cook would put 20,000 jobs at risk, including about 9,000 in the UK. The CAA could be forced to pick up some of the cost of covering the flights home of 150,000 UK customers abroad. Thomas Cook destinations range from mainland Europe to the Caribbean, the US and the Middle East. In a stock exchange announcement on Friday, the company said it was in talks with its banks, bondholders and biggest shareholder. The \u00a3200m would be designed to see it through the winter on top of a \u00a3900m rescue deal close to being finalised. \u201cDiscussions include a recent request for a seasonal standby facility of \u00a3200m, on top of the previously announced \u00a3900m injection of new capital,\u201d Thomas Cook said. \u201cThe recapitalisation is expected to result in existing shareholders\u2019 interests being significantly diluted, with significant risk of no recovery. The company will provide further updates in due course.\u201d The company\u2019s shares fell 21% to a new low of 3.5p. A year ago, the shares were worth 75p. Thomas Cook\u2019s banks, led by RBS, Barclays and Lloyds, have made a last-minute demand for it to raise new funds. The company is in talks with China\u2019s Fosun International, its biggest shareholder, which had already agreed to supply \u00a3450m in return for a majority stake in Thomas Cook\u2019s tour-operating business and a stake in its airline. The TSSA union, which has members in the branches and offices of Thomas Cook, called on the government to intervene to save \u201cjobs and an iconic brand\u201d. Thomas Cook was founded 178 years ago in 1841. The UK\u2019s pilots\u2019 union called on the government to push RBS and Lloyds, both bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis, to support the company. \u201cIt is appalling that banks that owe their very existence to handouts from the British taxpayer show no allegiance to a great British company,\u201d said Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association. \u201cThe government has a say in this, owning one of the key banks and still with huge influence over the other. RBS and Lloyds should be told by the prime minister to support Thomas Cook.\u201d Thomas Cook has been brought low by a debt burden of \u00a31.7bn, competition from online rivals and one-off factors such as Brexit uncertainty, all of which have weighed on Thomas Cook\u2019s recovery after a near-collapse in 2011. High prices of jet fuel and hotels have also pushed up costs, while the heatwave in summer last year convinced potential customers to stay at home, with a further effect on earnings. The previous biggest UK peacetime repatriation was in 2017 when Monarch Airlines collapsed. The CAA had to organise flights home for 110,000 customers on specially chartered planes. Following the demise of Monarch, the government promised to act on airline insolvency rules to ensure taxpayers would not in future pick up the bill to get home. A review was published earlier this year recommending an additional 50p levy per airline passenger. The government promised to \u201cswiftly introduce the reforms needed to secure the right balance between strong consumer protection and the interests of taxpayers\u201d, but as yet no action has been taken. Thomas Cook package holidaymakers would be protected by the Atol (Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence) scheme, meaning their holiday accommodation as well as return flights are effectively guaranteed if they are abroad at the time of a collapse. Future bookings are also protected. The total cost of holidaymakers guarantees to be paid by the Atol scheme underwritten by the CAA is an estimated \u00a3600m. The CAA\u2019s Air Travel Trust fund, the primary source for meeting Atol obligations for failed companies, is currently worth \u00a3170m, with insurance worth another \u00a3400m. About half of Thomas Cook customers have only booked flights only and may not come under Atol protection, but the Monarch precedent suggests the government would assume responsibility for bringing them home. That bill could far exceed the \u00a360m spent on the Monarch rescue operation, with many passengers currently on holiday in the Caribbean and the US. The CAA said: \u201cWe are in regular contact with all large Atol holders and constantly monitor company performance. We do not comment on the financial situation of the individual businesses we regulate.\u201d Around 600,000 customers in total are abroad with Thomas Cook \u2013 which has significant operations in mainland Europe \u2013 including around 300,000 Germans and tens of thousands of Scandinavians.",

It is the first time Netflix has detailed its spend on making and licensing British-made shows \u2013 which include The Crown, Black Mirror and Sex Education. Speaking at the Royal Television Society conference on Friday, Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive, said the UK had the second-biggest production budget after the US. And he hinted that the company would seek to fight off competition from rivals Apple, Amazon and Disney by offering \u201cgolden handcuff\u201d deals to top-tier creative talent. When asked by the Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark if Netflix was pursuing Phoebe Waller-Bridge for an exclusive talent deal, Hastings said he did not know. However, when asked if the company was seeking such deals with other talent, Hastings said: \u201cYou could say that, but I couldn\u2019t possibly comment.\u201d Netflix is thought to be arranging an exclusive tie-up with Charlie Brooker, the writer behind Black Mirror and Bandersnatch, and to be in negotiations for a deal with Peter Morgan, the creator of The Crown. The company, which expects to spend about $15bn globally making and licensing TV shows and films this year, will increase its budget and productions still further to fight the challenge of the launch of a swathe of well-funded new rivals. In October, it will take over all of Shepperton Studios, home to films ranging from Alien to Mary Poppins, as part of a 10-year deal to guarantee the space it needs to pump out its ever-increasing number of productions without delay. Disney, which is due to launch its global streaming service, Disney+, recently struck a similar deal with Shepperton\u2019s parent Pinewood Studios, home to the James Bond and Star Wars franchises. Competition is heating up in the streaming wars as new entrants attempt to break the global duopoly of Netflix and Amazon. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have amassed 240 million subscribers worldwide, with almost 20 million in the UK. Apple TV+ will launch on 1 November, with star attractions including Jennifer Aniston in her first TV series since Friends, a comedy drama called The Morning Show with fellow A-listers Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.

Soldiers forced the organisation to stop its work in the region on 18 September. The army says Action Against Hunger has been supplying terrorists with food and drugs and declared the agency, which has carried out humanitarian and development work for 40 years, \u201cpersona non grata\u201d. A spokesperson said the army had \u201cobserved with utter disappointment and concern the notorious activities of some non-governmental organisations working in the north-east\u201d. \u201cThe subversive \u2026 actions of the NGO Action Against Hunger persisted despite several warnings to desist from aiding and abetting terrorists and their atrocities,\u201d added the spokesperson. Action Against Hunger has called on the Nigerian authorities to allow its work in the region to continue. The organisation said it received \u201cno prior notice or explanation for this action\u201d and had been forced to stop assistance to \u201cmillions of people in Maiduguri, Monguno and Damasak with immediate effect\u201d, affecting \u201cthe most vulnerable people in the region\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Recently surfaced photos of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in brownface while at an \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party in 2001 are disturbing on a number of levels. First, if you\u2019ll allow me to point out the obvious, Trudeau is the only person in makeup! The other partygoers who are pictured are barely costumed, yet Trudeau looks like he just walked out of an old Tintin comic book as the stereotypical Arab villain.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t end there. The makeup that Trudeau is wearing in the photos is not limited to his face but is liberally applied across his breastbone and completely covers his hands. Imagine how much thought and action (and make up!) must have gone into planning and painting young Justin Trudeau brown.</p> <p>Third, Justin Trudeau wasn\u2019t young! He was 29-years-old at the time of this party. Like the rest of us mortals (his image in the US notwithstanding), Trudeau is bound to the rules of space and time, which means that, when this party was thrown, Trudeau was not acting in some minstrel show in the American south in 1901. On the contrary, he was 29 years-old, in Vancouver, and living in the year 2001. By 2001, minstrelsy was already recognized as socially unacceptable behavior.</p> <p>Fourth, Justin Trudeau seems to have a blackface/brownface problem, with earlier examples now coming to light. The now world-famous and debonair Canadian politician has, on at least two occasions, been recorded in blackface, surely disappointing legions of his fans across the globe. Just think about it. While so people in the US seem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/26/melania-trump-trudeau-photo-memes-g7\">ready</a> to believe that Melania or Ivanka (or both) are ready to ditch Trump and hitch a universal-health-care ride to Trudeau-land due to the young leader\u2019s good looks and suave manners, Trudeau seems to want to play out some deep-level desire to leave his whiteness behind and become\u2026an Arab.</p> <p>Justin Trudeau wants to be me.</p> <p>I\u2019m joking, of course, to make a point. I doubt Trudeau wants to be an Arab man or a black man or an Indian man, though he has dressed up as all three. But what such racial pantomimes do is exaggerate the distance between white people and non-white people for the amusement of the dominant culture. Nothing underlines whiteness more than a white person temporarily and exaggeratedly leaving whiteness behind and acting like a person of some other race.</p> <p>Why? Because racial pantomimes are not really about costumes or humor but are about power, the power to degrade the people of another race, the power to ridicule the manners of another ethnicity, and the power to make racism look like it\u2019s all just good fun.</p> <p>Nor is this kind of racism limited to the politicians in Canada. I grew up in Canada (I hold both American and Canadian citizenship) and what I see in these photos feels personal. I remember very clearly the bullying and taunts that the few non-white kids, myself included, routinely faced in school. As a Muslim kid, I was forced to leave my elementary school classroom and wait in the hall while the Lord\u2019s Prayer was read aloud over the school speakers. As a brown kid, I was constantly told by other kids that I was dirty because my knees and elbows were a darker color than the rest of my skin. In my high-school gym\u2019s locker room, I was regularly ridiculed and beaten because I was a \u201cPaki,\u201d and any brown kid in Canada when I was growing up was pejoratively called a \u201cPaki.\u201d My feeble response at the time was to tell my attackers: \u201cI\u2019m not from Pakistan.\u201d That would sometimes elicit a pause. Then a chuckle. Then the beating would continue.</p> <p>Now, it\u2019s true that things have improved in Canada since I was growing up in the 1970s and 80s, but it\u2019s also true that Canadians still aren\u2019t all that good at confronting their own racisms. This is partly because the American behemoth to the south had for a long time convinced many Canadians that racism was limited to the anti-black bigotry of the American variety. Today, many Americans (and a few Canadians) still believe the myth of a non-racist Canada. But Canadian racism is real, and it\u2019s still as pernicious, systemic and psychologically damaging as any other. Indigenous communities in particular are still forced to battle Canadian racism in the most profound ways conceivable. And until there is a real movement to confront and eliminate it in all of its varieties, racism will live on in Canada and these incidents and injustices will keep occurring.</p> <p>The immediate question in front of us is what Canadians should do today. Trudeau and his Liberal Party are now in the final weeks of a re-election campaign, and the main challenger, the Conservative Party, headed by Andrew Scheer, is already exploiting the scandal. Scheer has called Trudeau \u201cnot fit\u201d to be prime minister. But just days earlier, Scheer was <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/8xw8eb/andrew-scheer-had-a-very-bad-weekend\">excusing</a> the rampant and excessive racism and homophobia found among members of his own party. And while the Liberals have disappointed indigenous communities on several fronts since assuming power, the Conservatives haven\u2019t even offered an indigenous policy or strategy.</p> <p>Which leads us to the clear answer. Justin Trudeau\u2019s racist pantomimes are reprehensible. But let\u2019s make sure that what we are examining is not only Trudeau but also Canada and its racism. Otherwise, the solutions we come up with will be not even skin deep but simply made-up.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

Yet the older I get and the more I understand how the world works, as the sheer scale of its nastiness reveals itself, the more I\u2019m drawn to the absurd and the harmless. I still love turgid books and big ideas, but there is something nourishing in seeing people enjoy themselves, carefree. I am still yet to sing, but I have now cheered on many friends in a karaoke booth as they belt out songs from Frozen, and whooped for the dancers, pranksters and fools readily available on my phone. After all, I\u2019m finally mature enough to enjoy them.",

He dreamed of becoming a reporter but was too appreciated as an illustrator to get a real chance of writing. He spent his free time researching the rightwing networks of Sweden, often working with his life partner Eva Gabrielsson.

Hey, maybe I should write a book on this.\u201d</p> <p>We know that a year after the murder, in January 1987, he delivered a 30-page memo to the police about an alleged \u201cmiddle-man\u201d called Bertil Wedin. Larsson had obtained much of his information from one of Gable\u2019s sources close to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6\" title=\"\">MI</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6\" title=\"\">6</a>. Wedin was a former military officer, officially working in London writing journalism for the Swedish business community in the early 1980s, whofrequented the Conservative Monday Club and had close links to many powerful Tory party members. Unofficially, Wedin was allegedly providing information to several foreign security services, including the South African Bureau for State Security, Sweden\u2019s S\u00e4po and the CIA. In 1982, the London offices of the liberation organisations the African National Congress and the South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation<strong> </strong>were broken into, with documents stolen and handed over to the South African secret service (but only after MI5 were allowed to make copies, the BBC revealed in 2014). <a href=\"https://books.google.se/books?id=uXiyy74NQnoC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=burglaries+peter+casselton+1982+london&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wjUho7lLcj&amp;sig=ACfU3U1rmiYAl-mZ-06KPYPhzfqtv0X5sQ&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=burglaries%20peter%20casselton%201982%20london&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Wedin was cleared of the burglary</a>, while two other people were sentenced to jail. Three months before the assassination of Palme, <a href=\"https://www.svd.se/bertil-wedin-i-am-not-the-murderer\" title=\"\">Wedin</a> had moved to northern Cyprus, an infamous haven for anybody who wanted to avoid being extradited. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The assassination is one of most unbelievable and amazing cases of homicide I have ever had the unpleasant job of covering</p> <footer> <cite>Stieg Larsson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Swedish police took Larsson seriously and in May 1987 newspapers reported that their main theory was that the South African security service had instigated the assassination with the support of Swedish rightwingers. (The South Africans wanted to get rid of one of the fiercest opponents of apartheid and stop him from exposing dirty weapons deals. Swedish rightwingers wanted to stop Palme from \u201cselling out\u201d Sweden to the Soviet Union. Or so went the hypothesis.) But when a new head of investigation was appointed in February 1988, he decided that any theory involving more than one perpetrator would be put on hold indefinitely. His motives were unclear, but there was a need to calm the waters following a number of wild conspiracy theories, including one that a group of gay men had taken control of the investigation and led it in the wrong direction.</p> <p>In December of that year, Christer Pettersson, a drug addict, was arrested and charged with the murder. It would have been a comfortable solution for all parties \u2013 except Pettersson \u2013 but he was freed by the court of appeal in November 1989. In the eyes of the police, politicians and most of the media, he remained guilty for decades to come. The police even coined a new expression for the case. It had achieved \u201cpolice closure\u201d. Pettersson made the most of it. He gave interviews with semi confessions for money and was paid \u00a35,000 for nude photos in Swedish Hustler.</p> <p>All these years later, the case still rumbles on. In 2016, Sweden\u2019s PM Stefan L\u00f6fven told the press that he still believed Pettersson was guilty. But last year, a new prosecutor with the unfortunate name Krister Petersson stated officially that it was not Christer Pettersson who killed Olof Palme. The case remains open.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b556e93da7f8196d707cde2fba8788f95ba27a91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b556e93da7f8196d707cde2fba8788f95ba27a91/228_0_1636_2044/800.jpg\" alt=\"Christer Pettersson was charged with the murder of Olof Palme in 1988 but cleared by the court of appeal a year later\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christer Pettersson was charged with the murder of Palme in 1988 but cleared by the court of appeal a year later</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Larsson never got the chance, but I have tried to write the book he would have written on the murder. A week before <em>The Man Who Played With Fire</em> was published in Sweden, the police requested I hand the book over. A couple of days later, officers from the Palme investigation questioned a new suspect and searched his safe deposit box. Police on the case have confirmed they are working on a number of leads from the book, including one that could be taken from the plot of a novel: on 2 March 1986, two days after the assassination, a group of young men passed the steps of the narrow street Jutas Backe, a few hundred metres from the scene of the murder in the direction of the killer\u2019s escape route that Larsson plotted on his map. One of the group noticed a walkie-talkie next to some railings and picked it up. At the time, their focus was more on beer and rock music than on the Palme murder so instead of taking the device to the police they gave it away as a birthday present.</p> <p>When I heard this story from a friend two years ago, I failed to track down the walkie-talkie. Recently, I tried again. A series of phone calls later, one of the group was on his way to Stockholm. With him came the walkie-talkie and soon I was holding a Danita Beta III that was probably used in connection with the murder. The time and location of its discovery corroborate the escape route described by Larsson in his letter to Gerry Gable, and also his theory that it was a conspiracy. So who held the other walkie-talkie, and where are they now? The current head of the investigation, Hans Melander, tells me that the police are pursuing this line of inquiry.</p> <p>In the last year I have met the police many times. It is clear that their work is moving in the right direction, but very slowly. After 33 years the police are still trying to meet the suspected middleman, Bertil Wedin, in Cyprus. He denies any role in the murder. Information about South African involvement continues to come in, but a visit to South Africa has yet to happen. To the outside world they maintain that they are making progress, but to handle such a large murder investigation with just four officers, who are also dealing with other cases, must feel hopeless. The Palme murder is the worst crime ever perpetrated against democratic society in Sweden. Yet the investigation has not received more manpower.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/16/olof-palme-sweden-prime-minister-unsolved-murder-new-evidence\">Who killed the prime minister? The unsolved murder that still haunts Sweden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite this, I\u2019m convinced that the last pieces of the puzzle can be put together. Larsson laid out all the important pieces back in 1987. But the Swedish judicial system is in crisis. The rape accusation against Julian Assange, the wrongful conviction of Thomas Quick for the murders of eight people, and this summer\u2019s assault case involving the rapper A$AP Rocky, over which Donald Trump put pressure on our prime minister, are just a few of the incidents that have put the Swedish legal system in the spotlight internationally. I believe that this time the initiative will come from abroad. <em>The Man Who Played With Fire</em> is being published in more than 50 countries, and when people read how the Swedish judicial system has failed, tough questions are bound to be put to the decision-makers: why did the innocent Pettersson remain under suspicion for three decades? Was Larsson on to something when he wrote about the involvement of Swedish rightwing extremists with connections to S\u00e4po? Why haven\u2019t adequate resources been allocated? </p> <p>One thing is clear: without Larsson\u2019s world-famous novels, nobody would have looked for his forgotten archive. His theory on the Palme murder would have remained forgotten and this new opportunity to solve the murder wouldn\u2019t be here. </p> <p><em>\u2022 The Man Who Played With Fire: Stieg Larsson\u2019s Lost Files and the Hunt for an Assassin by Jan Stocklassa will be published by Amazon Crossing on 1 October.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2019 to comply with Guardian style guidance on Cyprus.</p>",

Larsson\u2019s fascination was already clear in the letter he wrote to Gable 20 days after the murder: \u201cDear Gerry,\u201d it began, \u201cThe assassination of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme is, to be perfectly honest, one of most unbelievable and amazing cases of homicide I have ever had the unpleasant job of covering ... Hey, maybe I should write a book on this.\u201d We know that a year after the murder, in January 1987, he delivered a 30-page memo to the police about an alleged \u201cmiddle-man\u201d called Bertil Wedin. Larsson had obtained much of his information from one of Gable\u2019s sources close to MI6. Wedin was a former military officer, officially working in London writing journalism for the Swedish business community in the early 1980s, whofrequented the Conservative Monday Club and had close links to many powerful Tory party members. Unofficially, Wedin was allegedly providing information to several foreign security services, including the South African Bureau for State Security, Sweden\u2019s S\u00e4po and the CIA. In 1982, the London offices of the liberation organisations the African National Congress and the South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation were broken into, with documents stolen and handed over to the South African secret service (but only after MI5 were allowed to make copies, the BBC revealed in 2014). Wedin was cleared of the burglary, while two other people were sentenced to jail. Three months before the assassination of Palme, Wedin had moved to northern Cyprus, an infamous haven for anybody who wanted to avoid being extradited. The Swedish police took Larsson seriously and in May 1987 newspapers reported that their main theory was that the South African security service had instigated the assassination with the support of Swedish rightwingers. (The South Africans wanted to get rid of one of the fiercest opponents of apartheid and stop him from exposing dirty weapons deals. Swedish rightwingers wanted to stop Palme from \u201cselling out\u201d Sweden to the Soviet Union. Or so went the hypothesis.) But when a new head of investigation was appointed in February 1988, he decided that any theory involving more than one perpetrator would be put on hold indefinitely. His motives were unclear, but there was a need to calm the waters following a number of wild conspiracy theories, including one that a group of gay men had taken control of the investigation and led it in the wrong direction. In December of that year, Christer Pettersson, a drug addict, was arrested and charged with the murder. It would have been a comfortable solution for all parties \u2013 except Pettersson \u2013 but he was freed by the court of appeal in November 1989. In the eyes of the police, politicians and most of the media, he remained guilty for decades to come. The police even coined a new expression for the case. It had achieved \u201cpolice closure\u201d. Pettersson made the most of it. He gave interviews with semi confessions for money and was paid \u00a35,000 for nude photos in Swedish Hustler. All these years later, the case still rumbles on. In 2016, Sweden\u2019s PM Stefan L\u00f6fven told the press that he still believed Pettersson was guilty. But last year, a new prosecutor with the unfortunate name Krister Petersson stated officially that it was not Christer Pettersson who killed Olof Palme. The case remains open. Larsson never got the chance, but I have tried to write the book he would have written on the murder. A week before The Man Who Played With Fire was published in Sweden, the police requested I hand the book over. A couple of days later, officers from the Palme investigation questioned a new suspect and searched his safe deposit box. Police on the case have confirmed they are working on a number of leads from the book, including one that could be taken from the plot of a novel: on 2 March 1986, two days after the assassination, a group of young men passed the steps of the narrow street Jutas Backe, a few hundred metres from the scene of the murder in the direction of the killer\u2019s escape route that Larsson plotted on his map. One of the group noticed a walkie-talkie next to some railings and picked it up. At the time, their focus was more on beer and rock music than on the Palme murder so instead of taking the device to the police they gave it away as a birthday present. When I heard this story from a friend two years ago, I failed to track down the walkie-talkie. Recently, I tried again. A series of phone calls later, one of the group was on his way to Stockholm. With him came the walkie-talkie and soon I was holding a Danita Beta III that was probably used in connection with the murder. The time and location of its discovery corroborate the escape route described by Larsson in his letter to Gerry Gable, and also his theory that it was a conspiracy. So who held the other walkie-talkie, and where are they now? The current head of the investigation, Hans Melander, tells me that the police are pursuing this line of inquiry. In the last year I have met the police many times. It is clear that their work is moving in the right direction, but very slowly. After 33 years the police are still trying to meet the suspected middleman, Bertil Wedin, in Cyprus. He denies any role in the murder. Information about South African involvement continues to come in, but a visit to South Africa has yet to happen. To the outside world they maintain that they are making progress, but to handle such a large murder investigation with just four officers, who are also dealing with other cases, must feel hopeless. The Palme murder is the worst crime ever perpetrated against democratic society in Sweden. Yet the investigation has not received more manpower. Despite this, I\u2019m convinced that the last pieces of the puzzle can be put together. Larsson laid out all the important pieces back in 1987. But the Swedish judicial system is in crisis. The rape accusation against Julian Assange, the wrongful conviction of Thomas Quick for the murders of eight people, and this summer\u2019s assault case involving the rapper A$AP Rocky, over which Donald Trump put pressure on our prime minister, are just a few of the incidents that have put the Swedish legal system in the spotlight internationally. I believe that this time the initiative will come from abroad. The Man Who Played With Fire is being published in more than 50 countries, and when people read how the Swedish judicial system has failed, tough questions are bound to be put to the decision-makers: why did the innocent Pettersson remain under suspicion for three decades? Was Larsson on to something when he wrote about the involvement of Swedish rightwing extremists with connections to S\u00e4po? Why haven\u2019t adequate resources been allocated? One thing is clear: without Larsson\u2019s world-famous novels, nobody would have looked for his forgotten archive. His theory on the Palme murder would have remained forgotten and this new opportunity to solve the murder wouldn\u2019t be here. \u2022 The Man Who Played With Fire: Stieg Larsson\u2019s Lost Files and the Hunt for an Assassin by Jan Stocklassa will be published by Amazon Crossing on 1 October. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2019 to comply with Guardian style guidance on Cyprus.",

And that means ros\u00e9s \u2013 or rosados \u2013 with a little more heft. These are wines you can drink with the last of the season\u2019s barbecues or with a salad that includes cooked vegetables and grains, rather than crunchy, young veg. Deep, fruity ros\u00e9s also work well with spicy food, which is, after all, a year-round pleasure. (Never tried an Indian takeaway with a fruity ros\u00e9? You should give it a go.)

Particularly seeing as we may not be able to get hold of any after 31 October. (Actually, that\u2019s unlikely, I must admit: retailers have been stockpiling for months. It\u2019s after Christmas that we\u2019ll feel the pinch if we crash out of Europe without a deal, but more of that anon.)

And their production is simply a question of the winemaker leaving the juice in contact with the skins for a little bit longer, or picking the grapes when they\u2019re a bit riper. And while you wouldn\u2019t have touched a ros\u00e9 aged in oak or concrete back in the heady days of spring, consider it now. But serve it a little bit warmer than you would a lighter ros\u00e9, much as you would (I hope) serve a white burgundy less chilled than a pinot grigio in order to allow its more complex flavours to shine through. You can get half-bottles of the fabulous Domaine Tempier Bandol Ros\u00e9 (13%) for \u00a314.95 from Lea &amp; Sandeman (or for \u00a313.95 a bottle if you feel like splashing out and buying it by the case) to test the theory out.

Thousands. Every time I wheeled my bike out of my parents\u2019 garage I turned right and I was on the worlds circuit.\u201d</p> <p>It can surely be no coincidence that the joint race organisers, Welcome to Yorkshire, the tourism body for God\u2019s own county, routed the women\u2019s course right by her parents\u2019 house in Otley.

Instead of sitting on the sofa mainlining biscuits like other women past their due date, she was out in her Lycra, a bump jutting out above her cross bar, with her husband, Philip, then still riding for Team Sky.</p> <p>\u201cFunnily enough, that last bike ride included the finishing circuit for the worlds in Harrogate. I remember thinking it was pretty surreal that I was aiming to be racing up the final climb in a year\u2019s time and my life was about to change completely,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking back, I had zero idea just how much it was about to change.\u201d</p> <p>The plan, post birth, was for the couple to both carry on racing professionally. \u201cBefore you\u2019re parents you think: \u2018Ah, it\u2019ll be all right, what\u2019s the big deal?

I breastfed her as well for the first six months, so I was going out training for three hours, coming home and feeding her and going out again.\u201d</p> <p>So few professional bike racers return after having a baby that information on how to do it safely was limited. Dame Sarah Storey, the Paralympic cyclist who won two world titles 10 months after giving birth to her second child in 2018, was a key source of advice. \u201cShe breast fed until her kids were about two, and I was keen to understand from her how I was going to manage the feeds,\u201d says Deignan, who is one of only two mothers on the UCI world pro tour circuit.</p> <p>The other is Marta Bastianelli, the Italian ranked fifth in the world, who gave birth in 2014. But perhaps her fiercest rival in Yorkshire next week will be the Dutch rider Marianne Vos, multiple world champion in three cycling disciplines, who has had an incredible year coming back from injury. Deignan might be the Yorkshire favourite but the bookies\u2019 money will be on Vos, or <a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/netherlands-confirms-strong-teams-yorkshire-world-championships-437087\" title=\"\">fellow Dutchwomen</a> Annemiek van Vleuten or the reigning champion, her old Boels Dolmans teammate Anna van der Breggen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being a full-time mum would be the hardest job in the world, without a doubt.

Whereas this is a completely different ball game. I am going in with an opportunity to win if I have my best legs on the day.\u201d</p> <p>Not being the favourite means she will race differently from last time: \u201cI won\u2019t be the one attacking and making the race. I will be holding my cards close to my chest and very much playing a tactical race, which is not what I am used to. But I am really excited about it. I think it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d</p> <p>These days, riding her bike is a welcome break from the sometimes monotonous drudgery of parenting, she says: \u201cFor me, being a full-time mum would be the hardest job in the world, without a doubt. If you\u2019re doing it properly, if you\u2019re all in and being the best mum in the world 24 hours a day without getting that break when it\u2019s just about you and your own focus, well, those women have my utmost respect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"169c9dd4b35c8a5e3729fb2840843f9a945e68fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169c9dd4b35c8a5e3729fb2840843f9a945e68fa/0_224_4650_2791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie Deignan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie Deignan, in action at the Women\u2019s Tour this year, has dismissed talk of imminent retirement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Becoming a mother has changed her perspective: \u201cCycling is less important than it\u2019s ever been but I\u2019m more motivated than I\u2019ve ever been.

      "bodyText": "When her rivals line up in Bradford next Saturday for the UCI world road race, Lizzie Deignan can be confident that none know the course like she does. Every lump in the road, every tricky corner, every narrow bridge: she\u2019s navigated them all, countless times. \u201cI\u2019ve ridden the route so many times just by accident, before it was even announced as the women\u2019s road race,\u201d she said this week. \u201cHundreds. Thousands. Every time I wheeled my bike out of my parents\u2019 garage I turned right and I was on the worlds circuit.\u201d It can surely be no coincidence that the joint race organisers, Welcome to Yorkshire, the tourism body for God\u2019s own county, routed the women\u2019s course right by her parents\u2019 house in Otley. If it weren\u2019t for a big hedge, Carol and John Armitstead would be able sit in their back garden and watch their youngest daughter whizz past up the hill to Farnley with the rest of the peloton as she attempts to win her second rainbow jersey. \u201cAs soon as it was announced, I thought: I have to do that race,\u201d she said. There was just was just one small problem, albeit a nice one: she got pregnant last year and in September welcomed to the world her first daughter, Orla. Three days before she gave birth, her determination to become world champion again on home turf was undimmed. Instead of sitting on the sofa mainlining biscuits like other women past their due date, she was out in her Lycra, a bump jutting out above her cross bar, with her husband, Philip, then still riding for Team Sky. \u201cFunnily enough, that last bike ride included the finishing circuit for the worlds in Harrogate. I remember thinking it was pretty surreal that I was aiming to be racing up the final climb in a year\u2019s time and my life was about to change completely,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking back, I had zero idea just how much it was about to change.\u201d The plan, post birth, was for the couple to both carry on racing professionally. \u201cBefore you\u2019re parents you think: \u2018Ah, it\u2019ll be all right, what\u2019s the big deal? She\u2019ll fit in somewhere,\u2019\u201d laughs Deignan. It didn\u2019t take many sleepless nights before Philip decided to retire at the end of the 2018 season when his Sky contract ended. He is now Orla\u2019s primary carer and his wife is endlessly grateful: \u201cWe decided it was better that he focus on looking after Orla and supporting me in what would be a very difficult two years. I\u2019m so glad he has because it has made all the difference to our family.\u201d There were plenty of times on maternity leave when Deignan doubted her ability to return to racing, though she saddled up again the minute she got the all-clear from her doctor, six weeks post-delivery: \u201cIt\u2019s just so overwhelming in those first few months when you are absolutely exhausted and she wasn\u2019t sleeping. I breastfed her as well for the first six months, so I was going out training for three hours, coming home and feeding her and going out again.\u201d So few professional bike racers return after having a baby that information on how to do it safely was limited. Dame Sarah Storey, the Paralympic cyclist who won two world titles 10 months after giving birth to her second child in 2018, was a key source of advice. \u201cShe breast fed until her kids were about two, and I was keen to understand from her how I was going to manage the feeds,\u201d says Deignan, who is one of only two mothers on the UCI world pro tour circuit. The other is Marta Bastianelli, the Italian ranked fifth in the world, who gave birth in 2014. But perhaps her fiercest rival in Yorkshire next week will be the Dutch rider Marianne Vos, multiple world champion in three cycling disciplines, who has had an incredible year coming back from injury. Deignan might be the Yorkshire favourite but the bookies\u2019 money will be on Vos, or fellow Dutchwomen Annemiek van Vleuten or the reigning champion, her old Boels Dolmans teammate Anna van der Breggen. She knows everyone in Otley will be expecting her to win but has told herself that she\u2019s got nothing to lose. \u201cI\u2019ve already won a world title when I went in as the out-and-out favourite [in 2015] and I delivered as the favourite. Whereas this is a completely different ball game. I am going in with an opportunity to win if I have my best legs on the day.\u201d Not being the favourite means she will race differently from last time: \u201cI won\u2019t be the one attacking and making the race. I will be holding my cards close to my chest and very much playing a tactical race, which is not what I am used to. But I am really excited about it. I think it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d These days, riding her bike is a welcome break from the sometimes monotonous drudgery of parenting, she says: \u201cFor me, being a full-time mum would be the hardest job in the world, without a doubt. If you\u2019re doing it properly, if you\u2019re all in and being the best mum in the world 24 hours a day without getting that break when it\u2019s just about you and your own focus, well, those women have my utmost respect.\u201d Becoming a mother has changed her perspective: \u201cCycling is less important than it\u2019s ever been but I\u2019m more motivated than I\u2019ve ever been. I go out and I love riding my bike now. I have a perspective now having taken a year away from professional sport just how lucky I am to do it as a job.\u201d She doesn\u2019t think she has changed much but is overall much happier, following a stressful few years which nearly saw her banned from competing in the Olympics after she missed three drugs tests. \u201cFor me,being happy means I\u2019m a better bike rider.\u201d Deignan, now 30, was surprised to read a recent report that she would retire after the Tokyo Olympics next year. \u201cI was quite shocked by that headline. My immediate goals are the world championships and then the Olympic Games and I haven\u2019t thought about my goals after that. What will determine my retirement are so many unknown things, so it\u2019s far too soon to announce my retirement.\u201d Lizzie Deignan is an ambassador for the cycle insurance provider Cycleplan.

But if randy hubby and resisting wife feels cliched, Ranganathan fashions it into vivacious comedy, with an eye-catching scene involving \u2019er-indoors abandoned at dinner, Romesh between the sheets, and a blindfolded son singing Isn\u2019t She Lovely next door.</p> <p>All this flamboyant self-satire cheerfully offsets the cynicism \u2013 which in any case Ranganathan pointedly pulls back from at the end of each routine. It\u2019s just for fun, he tells us, all this grumpiness about his kids, or his defeatism about the climate crisis, which we\u2019re all too selfish to meaningfully combat. These disclaimers, alongside heartfelt sections on LGBT teaching in schools, Ranganathan\u2019s ethical diet (cue tart roleplay of the condescension to which vegans are exposed at dinner parties), or one about the stigma attached to dads kissing their children, all advertise the fundamentally decent chap displacing his misanthropy safely into comedy.</p> <p>Occasionally, he treads water.

Both of those sides are being asked to peak in their first match of the World Cup, then simmer for a few weeks and try to hit those heights again. Mentally that is a really tough ask. It\u2019s not hard to peak for game one because you\u2019ve been in camp for three months but you\u2019ll get to the quarter-finals after \u201cfallow weeks\u201d for matches they are expected to win comfortably and have to do so again.</p> \n<p>For England though, it is perfect.

In Ireland\u2019s first warm-up match against Italy over the summer, they chose to play out of their 22 from every ball they received from the restart. They were effectively practising new ways of doing things. Ordinarily, every time someone kicks long to Ireland they set up a ruck and Conor Murray box-kicks, either out on the halfway line or contestable for his runners. But against Italy they did not do it once because it was a live opportunity to try new things. England are not going to do that against Argentina or France but in the first two matches I would not be surprised if they do.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fef03be-90e4-4479-a966-6b06ac24f770\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Fixtures, tables and results</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/20/top-try-and-points-scorers-for-the-2019-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Top try and points scorers</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-stadium-guide\">Stadium guide</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-guide-to-the-referees\">Referee guide</a><br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Our latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute+sport/rugby-union\">minute-by-minute live reports</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\">Sign up to The Breakdown</a>, our free rugby union email newsletter</p>\n    <p><b>Team guides</b><br>Pool A: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-ireland-team-guide\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-japan-team-guide\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-russia-team-guide\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-samoa-team-guide\">Samoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-scotland-team-guide\">Scotland</a><br>Pool B: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-canada-team-guide\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-italy-team-guide\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-namibia-team-guide\">Namibia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-new-zealand-team-guide\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">South Africa</a><br>Pool C: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-argentina-team-guide\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">England</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-france-team-guide\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-team-guide\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-usa-team-guide\">USA</a><br>Pool D: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-team-guide\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fiji-team-guide\">Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-georgia-team-guide\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-uruguay-team-guide\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-wales-team-guide\">Wales</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Before they can focus too much on that however, the first 20 minutes will be vital.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>The final day of the last home cricket Test match is always tinged with melancholy. Even when England win a game to draw the series. It\u2019s the end of summer, the nights drawing in and a long slog through to spring. But the weekend had another layer of sadness as about 70 of us gathered in a beautiful Wiltshire garden to celebrate the life of an old friend who died of cancer in the summer. In May he was merely complaining of back pain; two months later he was dead. He was only 64. Ali had a variety of seemingly incompatible careers \u2013 there can\u2019t be many accountants who also made shoes for dozens of films including the Harry Potter series and Gladiator \u2013 but at heart he was basically an old hippie who was never happier than when driving around in his old VW camper van with his dog and friends in tow. So as well as some touching speeches, there was plenty of Grateful Dead and a spine-tingling live version of Gram Parsons\u2019 A Song for You performed by one of his closest friends, Rod. I knew him primarily as a lifelong supporter of the Hemingford Hermits, one of the world\u2019s worst cricket teams, for whom I played for about 25 years before my knee gave out. My performances were so mediocre it took the rest of the team five years to notice that I had actually retired. Ali never batted, never bowled and never fielded, making him the very best of us. Something that was recognised by him twice winning the award for Hermit of the Year. The second time posthumously. As we left to go back to London, our dog was so overjoyed to see the people who had looked after him while we were on holiday that he tried to get into their car. It was a day marked by loss.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s hard not to enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/jo-swinson-urges-lib-dems-to-fight-populists-for-heart-and-soul-of-britain-brexit\">Lib Dem party conference</a>. Bournemouth in the mid-September sun, when most holidaymakers have long since vacated the beach, is hard to beat and there is none of the ring of steel security that surrounds both the Labour and Conservative dos. There is no queueing up to have your pass checked by three separate security guards, followed by a 20-minute wait in a demilitarised zone as you and your bags are put through an airport scanner. Rather you just turn up at the front door, wait for 30 seconds at most while someone does a quick hand search of your bag, and you\u2019re in. You actually feel as if everyone is pleased you have made the effort to come rather than a problem to be managed. Much of the conference itself seemed to be focused on the thrill of the new. New leader, new opinion polls putting the party neck and neck with Labour, new Brexit policy and a half dozen new MPs. Sam Gymiah, Sarah Wollaston, Luciana Berger, Chuka Umunna, Angela Smith and Philip Lee were all given a hero\u2019s welcome and every event at which they spoke was packed. It did make me feel a bit sorry, though, for those Lib Dem MPs who had been with the party during the dog days when no one took much notice of them and were now rather taken for granted. Just about the only place where they were guaranteed a presence was in the merchandise stall. Here Tim Farron, Tom Brake and Wera Hobhouse took pride of place on the coffee mugs and fridge magnets as there hadn\u2019t been time to order in any with the defectors\u2019 faces on them. There were also several Lib Dems whom neither I, nor the woman running the stall, could identify. O tempora, o mores.</p> <h2><br><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Piers Morgan would no doubt tell me I need to man up and stop being such a snowflake, but Brexit is definitely doing nothing for my mental health. I feel depressed and my anxiety levels are sky high. I wake up in the morning with a sense of dread \u2013 it often takes a huge effort just to get out of bed \u2013 and I feel out of control most of the day. It becomes increasingly hard to be funny about things that aren\u2019t really funny and yet I wouldn\u2019t swap my job for the world. Satire at least gives me some release. But other things don\u2019t as much as they used to. There was a time when I was going through depressive episodes that football would give me a sense of purpose when little else did. The Spurs fixture list was imprinted in my brain. Now, not so much. Today I even forgot that Tottenham were playing their first Champions League match in Greece against Olympiacos until 10 minutes after kick-off. That\u2019s never happened before. I still go to all home games and quite a few aways \u2013 some things will never change \u2013 but I do feel slightly disconnected from the team. Part of the problem is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/30/new-spurs-stadium-review-tottenham-hotspur-lets-call-it-a-home-win\">new stadium</a>. I\u2019ve tried to love it, to embrace the increased capacity and the better facilities but I can\u2019t help missing the old White Hart Lane. Even the rancid toilets. Watching football at the new ground reminds me of going to a baseball game in the US, where people wander in and out of their seats during play. It has become more of a tourist destination than a place of communion. Every game there are different people sitting next to me and I yearn for the faces I used to see week in, week out. Even the bloke who used to annoy everyone by yelling \u201cCONCEN-TRATE\u201d throughout the game. Words I thought I would never write.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Three days at the upreme court following \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/judges-urged-to-back-mps-recall-if-they-rule-against-prorogation\">with a great deal of help from Owen Bowcott</a>, the Guardian\u2019s superb legal affairs editor \u2013 the appeals against the different rulings by the English and Scottish courts on the legality of the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament has been an intense but also uplifting experience. A sense that some people really did still care about the rule of law. It also gave me a new hero in the form of Lord Pannick \u2013 a total failure for nominative determinism \u2013 who was acting for Gina Miller against the government. Here was a man totally in command of both his brief and surroundings who could make complex arguments in plain English and cut through bullshit with ease. I could listen to him speak all day and if ever I found myself on the wrong side of the law, he\u2019s the man I would want on my side. Though I dare say I could probably only afford to pay for 20 seconds of his time, so I would have to pray my case was simple. I did wonder, though, quite whether his opposite numbers in court always feel quite as warm towards him as I \u2013 and, it seemed, many of the judges \u2013 did. Because however good you are, you are almost bound to look a bit crap in comparison. I\u2019m sure that on his day, Lord Keen, who was acting for the government, is a first-rate lawyer. But up against Pannick, he visibly crumbled and became almost incoherent. There again, Keen was having to make the tricky case that Boris Johnson was intrinsically trustworthy. Even Pannick might have struggled with that.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>I am full of wonder for the achievement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/17/cancer-survivor-sarah-thomas-first-person-swim-channel-four-times-non-stop\">Sarah Thomas</a> in swimming across the Channel four times without a break. Not just for her physical endurance \u2013 few swimmers can even manage a single crossing \u2013 but for her mental strength. The sheer pain and boredom involved in going through the same repetitive motion with no real change of scenery for well over two days is almost unimaginable. I\u2019ve always been a hopeless swimmer and I\u2019ve been far too scared to ride a bike out on the roads after the mother of one of my daughter\u2019s best friends was knocked off and killed by a lorry, so ever since I had my knee replaced with a lump of metal I\u2019ve had to rely on the non-load-bearing cross trainer in the gym for exercise.

      "bodyText": "Monday The final day of the last home cricket Test match is always tinged with melancholy. Even when England win a game to draw the series. It\u2019s the end of summer, the nights drawing in and a long slog through to spring. But the weekend had another layer of sadness as about 70 of us gathered in a beautiful Wiltshire garden to celebrate the life of an old friend who died of cancer in the summer. In May he was merely complaining of back pain; two months later he was dead. He was only 64. Ali had a variety of seemingly incompatible careers \u2013 there can\u2019t be many accountants who also made shoes for dozens of films including the Harry Potter series and Gladiator \u2013 but at heart he was basically an old hippie who was never happier than when driving around in his old VW camper van with his dog and friends in tow. So as well as some touching speeches, there was plenty of Grateful Dead and a spine-tingling live version of Gram Parsons\u2019 A Song for You performed by one of his closest friends, Rod. I knew him primarily as a lifelong supporter of the Hemingford Hermits, one of the world\u2019s worst cricket teams, for whom I played for about 25 years before my knee gave out. My performances were so mediocre it took the rest of the team five years to notice that I had actually retired. Ali never batted, never bowled and never fielded, making him the very best of us. Something that was recognised by him twice winning the award for Hermit of the Year. The second time posthumously. As we left to go back to London, our dog was so overjoyed to see the people who had looked after him while we were on holiday that he tried to get into their car. It was a day marked by loss. Tuesday It\u2019s hard not to enjoy the Lib Dem party conference. Bournemouth in the mid-September sun, when most holidaymakers have long since vacated the beach, is hard to beat and there is none of the ring of steel security that surrounds both the Labour and Conservative dos. There is no queueing up to have your pass checked by three separate security guards, followed by a 20-minute wait in a demilitarised zone as you and your bags are put through an airport scanner. Rather you just turn up at the front door, wait for 30 seconds at most while someone does a quick hand search of your bag, and you\u2019re in. You actually feel as if everyone is pleased you have made the effort to come rather than a problem to be managed. Much of the conference itself seemed to be focused on the thrill of the new. New leader, new opinion polls putting the party neck and neck with Labour, new Brexit policy and a half dozen new MPs. Sam Gymiah, Sarah Wollaston, Luciana Berger, Chuka Umunna, Angela Smith and Philip Lee were all given a hero\u2019s welcome and every event at which they spoke was packed. It did make me feel a bit sorry, though, for those Lib Dem MPs who had been with the party during the dog days when no one took much notice of them and were now rather taken for granted. Just about the only place where they were guaranteed a presence was in the merchandise stall. Here Tim Farron, Tom Brake and Wera Hobhouse took pride of place on the coffee mugs and fridge magnets as there hadn\u2019t been time to order in any with the defectors\u2019 faces on them. There were also several Lib Dems whom neither I, nor the woman running the stall, could identify. O tempora, o mores. Wednesday Piers Morgan would no doubt tell me I need to man up and stop being such a snowflake, but Brexit is definitely doing nothing for my mental health. I feel depressed and my anxiety levels are sky high. I wake up in the morning with a sense of dread \u2013 it often takes a huge effort just to get out of bed \u2013 and I feel out of control most of the day. It becomes increasingly hard to be funny about things that aren\u2019t really funny and yet I wouldn\u2019t swap my job for the world. Satire at least gives me some release. But other things don\u2019t as much as they used to. There was a time when I was going through depressive episodes that football would give me a sense of purpose when little else did. The Spurs fixture list was imprinted in my brain. Now, not so much. Today I even forgot that Tottenham were playing their first Champions League match in Greece against Olympiacos until 10 minutes after kick-off. That\u2019s never happened before. I still go to all home games and quite a few aways \u2013 some things will never change \u2013 but I do feel slightly disconnected from the team. Part of the problem is the new stadium. I\u2019ve tried to love it, to embrace the increased capacity and the better facilities but I can\u2019t help missing the old White Hart Lane. Even the rancid toilets. Watching football at the new ground reminds me of going to a baseball game in the US, where people wander in and out of their seats during play. It has become more of a tourist destination than a place of communion. Every game there are different people sitting next to me and I yearn for the faces I used to see week in, week out. Even the bloke who used to annoy everyone by yelling \u201cCONCEN-TRATE\u201d throughout the game. Words I thought I would never write. Thursday Three days at the upreme court following \u2013 with a great deal of help from Owen Bowcott, the Guardian\u2019s superb legal affairs editor \u2013 the appeals against the different rulings by the English and Scottish courts on the legality of the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament has been an intense but also uplifting experience. A sense that some people really did still care about the rule of law. It also gave me a new hero in the form of Lord Pannick \u2013 a total failure for nominative determinism \u2013 who was acting for Gina Miller against the government. Here was a man totally in command of both his brief and surroundings who could make complex arguments in plain English and cut through bullshit with ease. I could listen to him speak all day and if ever I found myself on the wrong side of the law, he\u2019s the man I would want on my side. Though I dare say I could probably only afford to pay for 20 seconds of his time, so I would have to pray my case was simple. I did wonder, though, quite whether his opposite numbers in court always feel quite as warm towards him as I \u2013 and, it seemed, many of the judges \u2013 did. Because however good you are, you are almost bound to look a bit crap in comparison. I\u2019m sure that on his day, Lord Keen, who was acting for the government, is a first-rate lawyer. But up against Pannick, he visibly crumbled and became almost incoherent. There again, Keen was having to make the tricky case that Boris Johnson was intrinsically trustworthy. Even Pannick might have struggled with that. Friday I am full of wonder for the achievement of Sarah Thomas in swimming across the Channel four times without a break. Not just for her physical endurance \u2013 few swimmers can even manage a single crossing \u2013 but for her mental strength. The sheer pain and boredom involved in going through the same repetitive motion with no real change of scenery for well over two days is almost unimaginable. I\u2019ve always been a hopeless swimmer and I\u2019ve been far too scared to ride a bike out on the roads after the mother of one of my daughter\u2019s best friends was knocked off and killed by a lorry, so ever since I had my knee replaced with a lump of metal I\u2019ve had to rely on the non-load-bearing cross trainer in the gym for exercise. I try to go at least three times a week \u2013 more frequently when on holiday \u2013 not just to keep me fit but to displace stress. I have to get my endorphin fix somehow these days. After turning up the resistance to level 15, all I\u2019m capable of focusing on after 20 minutes or so is the sheer exertion required to keep going. The longest I\u2019ve ever kept it up for was an hour and 45 minutes and it wasn\u2019t fatigue \u2013 even though I was knackered \u2013 that made me stop. It was the boredom. And I at least had the distraction of a TV to watch in the gym. Thomas just had the grey waves and the lights of her safety boat for company. Whatever she\u2019s got, I want some of it.

In court this week, a woman known as Jane Doe 1 described how the humiliation led to her abandoning her career in law and drove her to two suicide attempts. After details of the women were published on WikiPorn, with social media and in-depth personal information, a campaign of anonymous harassment began that included the films being sent to their friends and family. Since 19 August the San Diego superior court has been hearing evidence from the women, Jane Doe 1 and 21 others.

The women dispute that the contracts were signed fairly and in proper understanding of what would happen to the films they made. They had replied to ads on Craigslist asking for \u201cbeautiful college-type preppy girls\u201d aged 18 to 22 and interested in modelling. The plaintiffs claimed that after applying for modelling work on Craigslist, they received phone calls from women who have been described as a key part of the business \u2013 \u201creference women\u201d who pitched the idea of making porn and allegedly assured them that it would never go online. The plaintiffs alleged the recruiters laid out a false trail of information about distribution, which lawyers said was part of a deliberately dishonest business model. The defendants allegedly told the women that they were an Australian company and the videos would only be sold on DVD outside the US.

The women said that the agreed pay was then reduced based on this ranking. Even though they were underage, they were given alcohol \u2013 enough, Jane Doe 1 said, to get her drunk. In his opening statement, lawyer Edward Chapin told the court: \u201cHaving flown across the country, alone in a hotel room with at least two men who controlled their return flight, [the young women] felt they had no choice but to accept the lower figure.\u201d Giving evidence earlier, Jane Doe 15 said: \u201cIf I had known that they were posting it on the internet, that my name would be attached to it, that it would be [distributed] in the United States, if I had known that it was more than 30 minutes of filming \u2013 if I had known any of that, just any one of those, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d A month or two after filming, the videos went up online, not just on GirlsDoPorn but on many other hugely popular porn sites.

So severe was the impact of the films that she told the court she has had plastic surgery to try to create a new, unrecognisable face. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten cheek fillers to try and change the structure of my face and microbladed my eyebrows to try and change my appearance,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>Chinese journalists will soon be required to pass a test grading their understanding of Xi Jinping Thought, the socialist teachings espoused by the country\u2019s leader.</p> <p>A notice from China\u2019s media regulator has been sent to more than a dozen state-owned news organisations in Beijing over the last month. It instructs employees to prepare to take an exam on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/15/chinas-most-popular-app-brings-xi-jinping-to-your-pocket\">\u201cstudy Xi\u201d propaganda app</a><em>, </em>launched earlier this year, in order to have their press credential renewed.</p> <p>Most believe the regulation will soon apply to Chinese reporters across the country. Journalists from three media organisations, two of which were outside Beijing, told the Guardian their publications had also received informal notices to register on the app.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the top down to the bottom, I don\u2019t think anyone will be able to escape it,\u201d said one reporter from a broadcaster in the eastern Shandong province who said he was not authorised to speak on the topic.</p> <p>The on-site, closed-book exam, to be administered by news organisations in early October, will be divided into five parts, including two on Xi Jinping\u2019s teachings on socialism for the new era and Xi\u2019s \u201cimportant thoughts on propaganda\u201d, <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9DBZuJvGE-wDlGn1GcD65w\">according to Media Reform</a>, a self-published news account on WeChat.</p> <p>News of the test, first <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3028152/journalists-chinese-state-media-be-tested-loyalty-president-xi\">reported by the South China Morning Post</a> and the research programme <a href=\"http://chinamediaproject.org/2019/08/29/news-control-in-the-palm-of-your-hand/\">China Media Project</a>, comes as Chinese media face increasing restrictions. China is considered one of the least free countries to operate as a journalist, ranked 177 out of 180 in 2019 by Reporters Without Borders, above Eritrea and North Korea.</p> <p>While Chinese journalists face jail time and self-censorship is common, journalists especially from independent publications often push the envelope, investigating cases of local or corporate corruption. To get a press credential, journalists have previously been tested on their understanding of \u201cMarxist journalistic ideals.\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, it doesn\u2019t mean that much,\u201d the journalist from Shandong said. \u201cStill, it\u2019s a move to restrict public debate.\u201d</p> <p>Authorities have stepped up their regulation of Chinese media and the internet, which already limits access to foreign websites, including news sites.

      "bodyText": "Chinese journalists will soon be required to pass a test grading their understanding of Xi Jinping Thought, the socialist teachings espoused by the country\u2019s leader. A notice from China\u2019s media regulator has been sent to more than a dozen state-owned news organisations in Beijing over the last month. It instructs employees to prepare to take an exam on the \u201cstudy Xi\u201d propaganda app, launched earlier this year, in order to have their press credential renewed. Most believe the regulation will soon apply to Chinese reporters across the country. Journalists from three media organisations, two of which were outside Beijing, told the Guardian their publications had also received informal notices to register on the app. \u201cFrom the top down to the bottom, I don\u2019t think anyone will be able to escape it,\u201d said one reporter from a broadcaster in the eastern Shandong province who said he was not authorised to speak on the topic. The on-site, closed-book exam, to be administered by news organisations in early October, will be divided into five parts, including two on Xi Jinping\u2019s teachings on socialism for the new era and Xi\u2019s \u201cimportant thoughts on propaganda\u201d, according to Media Reform, a self-published news account on WeChat. News of the test, first reported by the South China Morning Post and the research programme China Media Project, comes as Chinese media face increasing restrictions. China is considered one of the least free countries to operate as a journalist, ranked 177 out of 180 in 2019 by Reporters Without Borders, above Eritrea and North Korea. While Chinese journalists face jail time and self-censorship is common, journalists especially from independent publications often push the envelope, investigating cases of local or corporate corruption. To get a press credential, journalists have previously been tested on their understanding of \u201cMarxist journalistic ideals.\u201d. \u201cTo be honest, it doesn\u2019t mean that much,\u201d the journalist from Shandong said. \u201cStill, it\u2019s a move to restrict public debate.\u201d Authorities have stepped up their regulation of Chinese media and the internet, which already limits access to foreign websites, including news sites. In July, a draft regulation under China\u2019s social credit system proposed punishing citizens for publishing information that \u201cviolates social morality\u201d or causes \u201cadverse social impacts\u201d. Xi has demanded loyalty from Chinese journalists before. In 2016, he told staff at three state-run news outlets in Beijing that they were \u201cthe propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name\u201d. According to Media Reform, the exam for journalists is not expected to be difficult. The notice sent to reporters from their editors said news organisations should establish study groups and begin preparing for the test. Sample questions will soon be uploaded to the app, according to the news website Sohu.com. The test will only be able to be retaken once. Journalists said they were not sure whether they would need to take it every time they renewed their press cards, done every five or six years. While some journalists said they resented the new rule, others were less critical. \u201cChinese society needs to strengthen political study and correctly lead public opinion,\u201d said a reporter with a paper in the south-western province of Guizhou, who asked not to be named. \u201cWestern media may be able to report on anything they want, but they also still pay attention to the ideology of their countries,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Everything was a bit last minute when Dennis Praet completed his \u00a318m transfer from Sampdoria to Leicester City last month. The Belgium international did his homework on his new club on the Sampdoria team bus and when he turned up at Leicester to sign a week or so later it was without the tools of his trade.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a really close call because it was deadline day,\u201d Praet says. \u201cI arrived at the training ground but there were some small issues with the contract and I think it was only one hour before the deadline that everything was figured out, so I signed just in time. But I arrived here with the thought that if I sign, I could go back to get my stuff I needed. But the gaffer really wanted me to stay for the first game. I had no boots, so I did two training sessions and the first game with somebody else\u2019s. I don\u2019t even know whose they were.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/20/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Praet smiles as he looks back on that rather chaotic start. At one stage Brendan Rodgers, Leicester\u2019s manager, thought Praet was ignoring him. \u201cHe sent me a text message the day before I came but it was on my Belgium number that I didn\u2019t have with me, so I saw it three days after I signed,\u201d says Praet, shaking his head. \u201cHe thought I didn\u2019t reply to him. He said: \u2018I sent you messages!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other lines of communication were already open at Leicester. Youri Tielemans, who had joined from Monaco earlier in the summer, was a former teammate at Anderlecht as well as being part of the Belgium squad, and Praet was soon on the phone to his countryman once he had satisfied himself that Leicester\u2019s style of play complemented his own.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard about the interest from Leicester in me, it was important for me to see how they played because I didn\u2019t know exactly. At that moment I was on the coach with Sampdoria, we were driving to a friendly game and I watched the second half of Leicester v Atalanta,\u201d says Praet, smiling at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cI know Atalanta from Italy \u2013 they\u2019re a really good team. But I was really surprised by the way Leicester were playing \u2013 with a really high press, really nice football, a lot of chances. At that moment I was sold. Of course after that, when it was really getting serious, I spoke with Youri about: \u2018How is the gaffer? How is the training centre? How are the players?\u2019 And he was so positive.\u201d</p> <p>Although the intensity of the Premier League has taken Praet a little by surprise \u2013 his debut at Chelsea was more like a basketball match when he came off the bench \u2013 he has no doubt he has made the right move and also believes Leicester can achieve something special this season. \u201cWe must be a team that tries to get into that top six,\u201d he says before Saturday\u2019s fixture at Tottenham, \u201cand I think we have the players to do it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c1e4a7aee2cde59abd087fea15b7a0ceb941b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c1e4a7aee2cde59abd087fea15b7a0ceb941b0/0_0_3392_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Praet went to school 70km from home to be part of Genk\u2019s academy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Praet went to school 70km from home to be part of Genk\u2019s academy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of a golden generation of Belgium players and gifted with a racket too (he was ranked the seventh-best tennis player in the country in his age-group at the age of nine), Praet has been linked with Premier League clubs since he was a schoolboy.

      "bodyText": "Everything was a bit last minute when Dennis Praet completed his \u00a318m transfer from Sampdoria to Leicester City last month. The Belgium international did his homework on his new club on the Sampdoria team bus and when he turned up at Leicester to sign a week or so later it was without the tools of his trade. \u201cIt was a really close call because it was deadline day,\u201d Praet says. \u201cI arrived at the training ground but there were some small issues with the contract and I think it was only one hour before the deadline that everything was figured out, so I signed just in time. But I arrived here with the thought that if I sign, I could go back to get my stuff I needed. But the gaffer really wanted me to stay for the first game. I had no boots, so I did two training sessions and the first game with somebody else\u2019s. I don\u2019t even know whose they were.\u201d Praet smiles as he looks back on that rather chaotic start. At one stage Brendan Rodgers, Leicester\u2019s manager, thought Praet was ignoring him. \u201cHe sent me a text message the day before I came but it was on my Belgium number that I didn\u2019t have with me, so I saw it three days after I signed,\u201d says Praet, shaking his head. \u201cHe thought I didn\u2019t reply to him. He said: \u2018I sent you messages!\u2019\u201d Other lines of communication were already open at Leicester. Youri Tielemans, who had joined from Monaco earlier in the summer, was a former teammate at Anderlecht as well as being part of the Belgium squad, and Praet was soon on the phone to his countryman once he had satisfied himself that Leicester\u2019s style of play complemented his own. \u201cWhen I heard about the interest from Leicester in me, it was important for me to see how they played because I didn\u2019t know exactly. At that moment I was on the coach with Sampdoria, we were driving to a friendly game and I watched the second half of Leicester v Atalanta,\u201d says Praet, smiling at the thought. \u201cI know Atalanta from Italy \u2013 they\u2019re a really good team. But I was really surprised by the way Leicester were playing \u2013 with a really high press, really nice football, a lot of chances. At that moment I was sold. Of course after that, when it was really getting serious, I spoke with Youri about: \u2018How is the gaffer? How is the training centre? How are the players?\u2019 And he was so positive.\u201d Although the intensity of the Premier League has taken Praet a little by surprise \u2013 his debut at Chelsea was more like a basketball match when he came off the bench \u2013 he has no doubt he has made the right move and also believes Leicester can achieve something special this season. \u201cWe must be a team that tries to get into that top six,\u201d he says before Saturday\u2019s fixture at Tottenham, \u201cand I think we have the players to do it.\u201d Part of a golden generation of Belgium players and gifted with a racket too (he was ranked the seventh-best tennis player in the country in his age-group at the age of nine), Praet has been linked with Premier League clubs since he was a schoolboy. He was shown around Arsenal\u2019s training ground as a 15-year-old by Liam Brady, when Praet was coming off the same conveyer belt in Genk that produced Kevin De Bruyne, Divock Origi and Thibaut Courtois. \u201cI had three or four really good options,\u201d Praet says. \u201cWe went to visit Arsenal, Lille, Ajax and Anderlecht.

All her novels are about survival. As Aunt Lydia reflects: \u201cWhat good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principles and then be crushed flat like a sock emptied of its foot? ... Better to hurl rocks than to have them hurled at you.\u201d Or as Atwood puts it: \u201cWe are ordinary as long as it is easy to be ordinary.\u201d She quotes a Polish resistance fighter from the second world war who once told her: \u2018\u201cPray that you will never have the occasion to be a hero.\u2019 You don\u2019t run into a burning building and rescue somebody unless there\u2019s a burning building \u2026 Similarly, you don\u2019t run away from a burning building and ignore everything, unless there\u2019s a burning building.\u201d</p> <p>But the main reason for not returning sooner to the world she had created was because, before now, it no longer seemed relevant. \u201cFor a long time we were going away from Gilead and then we turned around and started going back towards Gilead, so it did seem pertinent.\u201d <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em>, which Atwood began writing in West Berlin in 1984, was her response to those who wanted to reverse the freedoms gained by women in the 70s, to put the butterflies back in the box. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t have the power to make that happen.\u201d Now they do.</p> <p>The novel\u2019s status as a feminist classic has perhaps overshadowed another of its most prescient warnings \u2013 the catalyst for Gilead was environmental catastrophe. In <em>The Testaments</em> Aunt Lydia catalogues the natural disasters that ravaged \u201cher vanished country\u201d, before continuing. \u201cPeople became frightened. Then they became angry. The absence of viable remedies. The search for someone to blame. You don\u2019t believe the sky is falling in until a chunk of it falls on you.\u201d</p> <p>If the novel deals less explicitly with the crisis than we might have expected, her point is the same: the burden will fall hardest on women and children. \u201cIt always does, because women and children are weaker \u2013 let\u2019s take their stuff,\u201d she says. But, as Atwood points out, she \u201cdid climate apocalypse quite thoroughly\u201d in the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/28/maddaddam-margaret-atwood-review\" title=\"\">MaddAddam</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/28/maddaddam-margaret-atwood-review\" title=\"\"> trilogy</a>. \u201cMaybe not thoroughly enough,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think it is actually going to be worse.\u201d But she is not without hope, and if she was younger she would \u201cabsolutely be doing Extinction Rebellion\u201d. She was the first writer to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/27/margaret-atwood-scribbler-moon-future-library-norway-katie-paterson\" title=\"\"> donate a manuscript to the Future Library</a>, in which stories remain unread for 100 years, when they will be printed on paper from a newly planted forest in Norway.</p> <p>At an event last summer, a member of the audience asked Atwood for one word to sum up the times we are living in. \u201cVital,\u201d she fired back. \u201cThis is a hinge moment, in many different ways,\u201d she says now. \u201cLet\u2019s call it the casket moment,\u201d an allusion to the three caskets in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>. \u201cOne of those puzzles in which you need to open the right door.

Further up the river, Westminster is shutting down for five weeks. Ever since Boris Johnson raised the prospect of proroguing parliament, people have been sharing a quote from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, published 35 years ago, just as they did in the US following the election of Donald Trump in 2016: \u201cThat was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn\u2019t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed at home at night, watching television.\u201d \u201cIt is another predictable mess that people have got drawn into because a big honking pack of lies was told about it,\u201d Atwood says of Brexit.

Better to hurl rocks than to have them hurled at you.\u201d Or as Atwood puts it: \u201cWe are ordinary as long as it is easy to be ordinary.\u201d She quotes a Polish resistance fighter from the second world war who once told her: \u2018\u201cPray that you will never have the occasion to be a hero.\u2019 You don\u2019t run into a burning building and rescue somebody unless there\u2019s a burning building \u2026 Similarly, you don\u2019t run away from a burning building and ignore everything, unless there\u2019s a burning building.\u201d But the main reason for not returning sooner to the world she had created was because, before now, it no longer seemed relevant. \u201cFor a long time we were going away from Gilead and then we turned around and started going back towards Gilead, so it did seem pertinent.\u201d The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which Atwood began writing in West Berlin in 1984, was her response to those who wanted to reverse the freedoms gained by women in the 70s, to put the butterflies back in the box. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t have the power to make that happen.\u201d Now they do. The novel\u2019s status as a feminist classic has perhaps overshadowed another of its most prescient warnings \u2013 the catalyst for Gilead was environmental catastrophe. In The Testaments Aunt Lydia catalogues the natural disasters that ravaged \u201cher vanished country\u201d, before continuing. \u201cPeople became frightened. Then they became angry. The absence of viable remedies. The search for someone to blame. You don\u2019t believe the sky is falling in until a chunk of it falls on you.\u201d If the novel deals less explicitly with the crisis than we might have expected, her point is the same: the burden will fall hardest on women and children. \u201cIt always does, because women and children are weaker \u2013 let\u2019s take their stuff,\u201d she says. But, as Atwood points out, she \u201cdid climate apocalypse quite thoroughly\u201d in the MaddAddam trilogy. \u201cMaybe not thoroughly enough,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think it is actually going to be worse.\u201d But she is not without hope, and if she was younger she would \u201cabsolutely be doing Extinction Rebellion\u201d. She was the first writer to donate a manuscript to the Future Library, in which stories remain unread for 100 years, when they will be printed on paper from a newly planted forest in Norway. At an event last summer, a member of the audience asked Atwood for one word to sum up the times we are living in. \u201cVital,\u201d she fired back. \u201cThis is a hinge moment, in many different ways,\u201d she says now. \u201cLet\u2019s call it the casket moment,\u201d an allusion to the three caskets in The Merchant of Venice. \u201cOne of those puzzles in which you need to open the right door. So, \u2018All right human race, which door are you going to open?\u2019\u201d One of Atwood\u2019s central axioms is that nothing can be included in her fiction that hadn\u2019t happened somewhere in the world. As Atwood has reminded us: she didn\u2019t make this stuff up, the human race did. \u201cIf I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real,\u201d she wrote in a recent introduction to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. And this is \u201cabsolutely\u201d the case for The Testaments: shadows of Weinstein and Epstein, Isis and the Trump administration can all be found in its murky waters. It is impossible to read the scenes set in a female detention camp without thinking of the US-Mexico border. Is Atwood firing a warning or reflecting what is already happening? \u201cBoth. But warnings aren\u2019t effective if they are just preaching. Enactments are of interest because then people think \u2018What would I do?\u2019 Whereas if someone is going \u2018Don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d she says, wagging her finger. \u201cYou think \u2018Oh shut up!\u2019\u201d This is the sixth time Atwood has been shortlisted for the Booker prize. \u201cThere are upsides and downsides\u201d to winning, she says. If you win everyone says you shouldn\u2019t have won the Booker. And if you don\u2019t win, in Canada anyway, they say \u2018Atwood fails to win Booker\u2019.\u201d And then there is the Nobel. \u201cOh purlease \u2026\u201d She is already at work on a collection of poetry, often her way of working up to a novel. And she hasn\u2019t ruled out a further instalment: \u201cNever say never to anything.\u201d \u201cOnly dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive\u201d: so Aunt Lydia opens The Testaments. Is there an Atwood statue? \u201cThere\u2019s a head,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWe used to call it the horrible head.\u201d The plaster cast is in her cellar, the original, made in the 70s, at McMaster University. \u201cI don\u2019t look like that,\u201d she told the sculptor, who replied. \u201cBut you will \u2026\u201d \u201cPeople bang on about your legacy,\u201d she says, impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m not that interested because I\u2019m not going to be here. I\u2019m not going to be around haunting my legacy. Unless I do an Aunt Lydia and bury little manuscripts in libraries.\u201d Well, there\u2019s already that story buried away in the Future Library.

      "bodyText": "So long as it\u2019s made from ripe tomatoes, I think sugo is fine without sugar, but my partner disagrees. What do you think? Peter, Zollikon, Switzerland September is the month when British outdoor-grown tomatoes are at their peak, not to mention cheapest, so hit the market, fill your boots and channel your inner nonna by making vats of this classic pasta sauce. As for Peter\u2019s domestic dispute, the simple answer is: it obviously all depends on the quality of the tomatoes, though, as with all cooking, your own tastes play a pivotal role, too, says Rachel Roddy, Feast\u2019s Italian correspondent. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this idea that adding sugar is wrong or even an issue came from,\u201d she says with a shake of the head. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve seen so many cooks add a pinch of sugar in much the same way as you\u2019d adjust the taste with salt.\u201d Essentially, the less ripe your tomatoes, the more likely they\u2019ll be to need a little something to help them along. Not only that, Roddy adds, but \u201cplenty of tomatoes are really quite acidic, so will only benefit from a bit of added sugar\u201d. Even the great and the good of the food world can\u2019t reach a consensus on the matter. Claudia Roden opts for \u201ca teaspoon of sugar, or to taste\u201d, for every kilo of fresh tomatoes (or 800g of tinned), whereas Anna del Conte adds the same amount to sugo made with tinned, but omits it \u201cin the summer when good fresh tomatoes are on the market\u201d; Alastair Little adds just \u201ca little sugar\u201d to his sugo by default, and Giorgio Locatelli only \u201cif needed\u201d. The queen of Italian food writing, Ada Boni, however, makes no mention of sugar at all, a path followed a quarter-century later by Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray in their 1990s River Cafe books. That restaurant\u2019s current head chef, Joe Trivelli, is on-message, too. \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t do it,\u201d he says, though he accepts that may have something to do with being fortunate enough to work only with impeccable produce. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the tomatoes,\u201d he says. \u201cGood ones will be sweet enough as they are. Everyone used to put tomato puree in tomato sauce \u2013 well, my mum did, anyway \u2013 and that\u2019s also pretty pointless; all it does is add an artificial, sweet taste.\u201d Mind you, Trivelli says, certain brands of tinned tomatoes come swimming in juice of questionable origin, so in some circumstances sugar is kind of forgivable. \u201cAfter all, when I was a student, we were taught always to add a touch of sugar, but I\u2019d forgotten about it until now \u2013 it hasn\u2019t crossed my mind to do so in years.\u201d That said, officially the best sugo recipe in the whole world ever (don\u2019t all @ me at once, please: it\u2019s just a statement of fact), namely \u201ctomato sauce III\u201d in Marcella Hazan\u2019s 1976 Classic Italian Cookbook, includes a quarter-teaspoon of granulated sugar per kilo of ripe plum tomatoes. To make it, wash and halve the toms, then simmer in a covered pot for 10 minutes. Pass the now slightly slumped fruit through a food mill back into the pot, add 110g butter, a peeled and halved onion, a touch of salt and the sugar, and leave to burble and reduce gently, lid off, for 45 minutes. Pick out the onion, adjust the sauce for salt, then toss through cooked pasta or gnocchi. You\u2019ll never view pasta al pomodoro the same again, promise \u2013 as Hazan so modestly put it, this sauce is \u201cunsurpassed\u201d, and who am I to disagree? \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Knight confirms Mosley will return in the sixth season and goes on to say that he has as good as cast an actor in the role of Diana Mitford, second wife to the leader of the British Union of Fascists, the party Mosley founded in 1932. While the Peaky Blinders are roughly based on a real-life gang and their enemies \u2013 former adversaries Billy Kimber and Darby Sabini did exist \u2013 the plot has played fast and loose with facts. With Mosley, the most well-known character depicted, Knight says his storyline will be more historically accurate. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is take history, and the specific things history notices, then write around the things that aren\u2019t so known,\u201d he says. \u201cSo Mosley was having an affair with his wife\u2019s sister and stepmother, but history doesn\u2019t count that, that isn\u2019t what we know him for. But who the hell does that? He was charismatic and magnetic, which made his message seductive and enabled him to draw people in. I want to make people see that evil is seductive and that we need to be careful. \u201cThe rise of fascism, racism, national socialism and populism ... it\u2019s happening now,\u201d continues Knight. \u201cI looked at Mosley\u2019s speeches, and one of them began \u2018Do not believe false news.\u2019 He was telling people that the media was lying to them, that foreigners were taking things away from them. It\u2019s my good fortune \u2013 but the world\u2019s bad fortune \u2013 that these things are happening again and I can write about them. I just hope people realise that nine years after Mosley started making these speeches there was a world war. Let\u2019s not do it again.\u201d Knight is speaking at the the Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival and standing about 50 feet from the first reported crime by a Peaky Blinder \u2013 an assault in March 1890, years before the events depicted in the show. On the street below, there are thousands of fans dressed in period attire in tribute to their favourite characters. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream.\u201d A huge draw across the Midlands, there are fans from all over the UK, from France and Belgium. Earlier in the day, Knight met one fan who had travelled from Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole world we\u2019ve created, it\u2019s more than just clothes and a good soundtrack,\u201d he says. \u201cI do lots of projects in film and TV. You have some that are lucky, and some that are unlucky. Peaky is the luckiest project I\u2019ve ever been involved with. Every time we leap forward a couple of years, we hit a period of history that has such resonance. None more so than the current series. I don\u2019t plan these things that far ahead, it just happens.\u201d",

His daughter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/five-things-we-learned-from-david-cameron-memoir-boris-johnson-michael-gove-referendum\">Nancy</a> is on the line. She wants to know if he will be free to come and see her awarded a school prize. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, darling,\u201d he assures her. \u201cI\u2019ve almost finished all these hideous interviews.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the past week, and for the first time in more than three years, Cameron has barely been off the airwaves or out of the media. The hideous interviews have come thick and fast. Some of the headlines they have made have been calculated, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/david-cameron-accuses-boris-johnson-and-michael-gove-of-behaving-appallingly-over-brexit\">settling of scores with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove</a> over Brexit. Others have been inadvertent, like the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/david-cameron-sought-intervention-from-queen-on-scottish-independence\">Cameron lobbied for the Queen</a> to \u201craise an eyebrow\u201d about the Scottish independence campaign during the referendum in 2014.</p> \n<p>At his launch party on Tuesday, the former prime minister joked that there were two hardback bestsellers being published this month. \u201cOne\u2019s a book about a riven society and a dangerous dictatorship,\u201d he told guests. \u201cAnd the other\u2019s by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/17/handmaids-sales-margaret-atwoods-the-testaments-is-immediate-hit\">Margaret Atwood</a>.\u201d His own book, it is clear from our interview, has a wider purpose. Three years after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union\">premiership collapsed</a> in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cameron is trying to regain the right to be heard, above all on Brexit and on the referendum that swept him from office.</p> \n<p>\u201cI totally understand that there will be some people I will never convince, who will say you should never have had it,\u201d Cameron says of the 2016 vote. He knows that millions of remain voters blame him viscerally for everything that has happened since then and probably always will. \u201cBut I think there are a lot of people who can also see that there was a growing inevitability about having a referendum and, yes, there was a problem in the Tory party, but the relationship with the EU was a far bigger one. Britain\u2019s position was becoming more tenuous, and we had to fix it. I hope that I can convince people that it was an honest and thought through attempt to deal with the issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is the nub of the case that weaves its way right through the 700 pages of Cameron\u2019s memoir and through much of what he has said in interviews this week. The UK\u2019s relationship with the EU was always both necessary and contingent, he argues. Until now, every prime minister for the last 40 years has simultaneously wanted a seat at the top table and a special deal for Britain. Every one of them, even Tony Blair, felt they had to fight off moves to political union. \u201cThese weren\u2019t pretend ghouls and ghosts,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cThey were real.\u201d It\u2019s a useful reminder that Cameron, so often dismissed as an insouciant optimist, is at heart a very practical politician.</p> \n<p>He is insistent that British ambivalence has origins that long predate the migration crisis or the rise of Nigel Farage. Cameron traces the roots back to Margaret Thatcher\u2019s support for the EU single market in the 1980s. \u201cThe single market was both the best thing and the worst thing for Conservatives. We created it. But then we didn\u2019t like the legislation that was needed to make it work.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EU is a law-based organisation that doesn\u2019t like exceptions,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe differing speeds issue had to be addressed, especially with the eurozone.\u201d Cameron thinks the balancing act would have had to continue even if remain had won in 2016. He quotes the downbeat assessment of an anonymous official (surely the Bank of England deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe) telling him \u201cit would have kept us in the EU for another 10 years\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy biggest regret\u201d, he says, is that he let expectations about his 2015-16 renegotiation get too high. \u201cI should have made it clear that some of the things my colleagues were arguing for were not available \u2013 picking and choosing which laws to obey, radical cuts in the budget, some sort of country club membership. These things are not possible.\u201d He thinks there was more substance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/02/eu-deal-key-points-what-cameron-wanted-and-what-he-got\">renegotiation deal he brought back from Brussels</a> in February 2016 than is now acknowledged. The concessions he achieved were \u201ca big deal for the EU. They hated it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some of that defiant confidence drains away when Cameron talks about the referendum process itself. He thought \u201ca lot\u201d about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. \u201cI agonise about that one.\u201d He thought the Electoral Commission \u201cgot it wrong\u201d by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. \u201cWe lost the vote so it\u2019s worth asking the question.\u201d He is scathing about Labour\u2019s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cThey were awol.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cameron\u2019s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. \u201cI\u2019m a remainer,\u201d he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold \u2013 and now unravel \u2013 since he walked away in July 2016.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eda986a8b387e14d28dd3be8e0cf4afe8b4609a1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eda986a8b387e14d28dd3be8e0cf4afe8b4609a1/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson, at the time he was Mayor of London, with Cameron in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron with Boris Johnson, then Mayor of London, in 2012.<br></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He says supportive things about Theresa May. \u201cShe was definitely a moderniser.\u201d But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that \u201cshe got a deal\u201d. He \u201cshares her frustration\u201d that it was then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/29/brexit-as-parliament-votes-again-what-happens-next\">voted down</a> by \u201cthe people who most wanted Brexit\u201d. But, crucially, he says that \u201cpicking one of the existing models, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/efta-countries-wary-of-commons-interest-in-norway-brexit-option\">Norway-style model</a>, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.\u201d</p> \n<p>And he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. \u201cIf you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>And, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron\u2019s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. \u201cI think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum. We\u2019re running out of ways to get unstuck what is stuck.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the first choice is to deliver the first referendum with a deal. But I\u2019m not keen at all on no deal. That would be a big risk for the country. But if we get stuck, it [a second referendum] should be an option and it shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. I think we\u2019re better off in, trying to fight for Britain\u2019s interests rather than trying to form a partnership which I think we could make work but which isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7f1e29b6-b970-4383-9dff-10544ded2213\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Cameron\u2019s memoir ranges wide across many issues. He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition\u2019s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that \u201csome of the early speeches were a bit \u2018Hello birds. Hello trees.\u2019\u201d he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into \u201ca modern compassionate Conservative party\u201d. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears.</p> \n<p>In the end, though, everything in Cameron\u2019s story always comes back to Brexit. \u201cIt is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it\u2019s so massive,\u201d he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing. But I was wrestling with a genuine problem. The trouble was I lost.\u201d </p>",

He thought \u201ca lot\u201d about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. \u201cI agonise about that one.\u201d He thought the Electoral Commission \u201cgot it wrong\u201d by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. \u201cWe lost the vote so it\u2019s worth asking the question.\u201d He is scathing about Labour\u2019s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cThey were awol.\u201d Cameron\u2019s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. \u201cI\u2019m a remainer,\u201d he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold \u2013 and now unravel \u2013 since he walked away in July 2016. He says supportive things about Theresa May. \u201cShe was definitely a moderniser.\u201d But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that \u201cshe got a deal\u201d. He \u201cshares her frustration\u201d that it was then voted down by \u201cthe people who most wanted Brexit\u201d. But, crucially, he says that \u201cpicking one of the existing models, a Norway-style model, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.\u201d And he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. \u201cIf you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.\u201d And, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron\u2019s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. \u201cI think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum. We\u2019re running out of ways to get unstuck what is stuck. \u201cI think the first choice is to deliver the first referendum with a deal. But I\u2019m not keen at all on no deal. That would be a big risk for the country. But if we get stuck, it [a second referendum] should be an option and it shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. I think we\u2019re better off in, trying to fight for Britain\u2019s interests rather than trying to form a partnership which I think we could make work but which isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d Cameron\u2019s memoir ranges wide across many issues. He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition\u2019s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that \u201csome of the early speeches were a bit \u2018Hello birds. Hello trees.\u2019\u201d he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into \u201ca modern compassionate Conservative party\u201d. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears. In the end, though, everything in Cameron\u2019s story always comes back to Brexit. \u201cIt is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it\u2019s so massive,\u201d he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing. But I was wrestling with a genuine problem. The trouble was I lost.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Humans have kept cats and dogs as pets for centuries, from deified kitties basking in the ancient Egyptian sun, to wolves nipping at the scraps of early man\u2019s hunting spoils. Until relatively recently, our pets were much more separate from us \u2013 particularly dogs, which weren\u2019t seen as companion animals in the eyes of most families until the 19th century. Now, they are bonafide members of the family. Cats have become more indoor-dwelling too, and owners have altered their environments with scratching posts and litter trays in response.</p> <p>With pet ownership on the rise, cats and dogs are becoming more closely intertwined with our lives. The amount we spend on our pets has gone up too, with the average <a href=\"https://www.bark.com/blog/do-you-have-a-pampered-pooch-uk-dog-owners-spend-57bn-on-their-pets-every-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\">British household spending more than \u00a33,000 on their dogs each year.</a></p> <p>There are more things to buy for our pets than ever: designer harnesses, organic dog food, pet cameras, automatic feeders and bedding that looks more comfortable than our own. As our lives get busier, the industry creates more ways to keep pets busy and happy in our absence.</p> <p>\u201cWe humanise our pets more than we used to, from buying them dog beer, to dog-friendly birthday cupcakes, Easter eggs and advent calendars,\u201d says Dr Karlien Heyrman, head of pets at Pets at Home. \u201cPets have become much more part of the family, and as people\u2019s lifestyles have changed, how we care for our pets has changed,\u201d she says. Having pets boosts our <a href=\"https://www.vets4pets.com/siteassets/vet-report/vet-report-2019-v5.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">oxytocin</a>, which lowers feelings of <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/dont-delay/201002/living-alone-can-canine-companionship-help-beat-loneliness\" rel=\"nofollow\">loneliness</a> and boosts our joy, so, of course, we want to spoil them.</p> <p>According to Heyrman, we use technology to look after our pets more than ever. She cites <a href=\"https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/cat/cat/cat-flaps/sureflap-microchip-cat-flap-connect-and-hub-bundle\" rel=\"nofollow\">microchip-operated</a> cat flaps and feeders, <a href=\"https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/petpat-pitpat-2---dog-activity-monitor\" rel=\"nofollow\">activity trackers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/petcube-bites-wi-fi-pet-monitor-camera-with-treat-dispenser\" rel=\"nofollow\">cameras</a> as just a few examples, and believes that the market will continue to grow. \u201cI expect a lot of advancements in this area, both to give pet owners more information about their pet and to give the vets looking after the pets more information about their health,\u201d she says. According to <a href=\"https://www.alvexo.com/blog/tech/billion-pound-uk-pet-tech-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alvexo</a>, pet tech options are becoming more affordable, which their experts believe will make the trend even more mainstream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"468a9e0dd9e44e8586f11ca2eb8af14cef7baa87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/468a9e0dd9e44e8586f11ca2eb8af14cef7baa87/0_33_1069_1336/800.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Sinclair has three rescue cats: Peanut, Lloyd and Schnoo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Sinclair has three rescue cats: Peanut, Lloyd and Schnoo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"acb3f542b78846f9e1e9f08629f0ea061e6920d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb3f542b78846f9e1e9f08629f0ea061e6920d2/0_74_1069_1336/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cat\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As our lives get busier, the industry creates more ways to keep pets busy and happy in our absence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"40bd2d3e262d4cc69e96fb6411d99ae2b095dd42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40bd2d3e262d4cc69e96fb6411d99ae2b095dd42/0_99_1069_1336/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sinclair treats her kitties to cat toys, scratching posts, and anything they could possibly want.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sinclair treats her kitties to cat toys, scratching posts, and anything they could possibly want.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"021d6fde1375bd4d39b42434fe924aebbb9f38e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/021d6fde1375bd4d39b42434fe924aebbb9f38e1/0_203_1167_1458/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cat\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Sinclair: \u2018I love them an embarrassing amount.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Emma Sinclair shares a \u201cheavily tech-enabled home\u201d with her three cats</p></li> </ul> <p>One owner who\u2019s ahead of the pet tech trend is Emma Sinclair, a tech entrepreneur who has three rescue cats: Peanut, Lloyd and Schnoo. She has a \u201cheavily tech-enabled home\u201d, which includes feeding machines with cameras, to ensure the cats are being fed and to keep an eye on them when humans aren\u2019t around. Additionally, the cats have an automated litter box and a water machine that keeps their drinks fresh. Sinclair says that as she and her partner lead busy lives, the clever technology ensures her cats are always well looked after: \u201cTechnology of any sort is there for certain reasons: to automate mindless, tedious tasks and to make life easier, so our time can be spent on more important things. We can ensure that they are well fed, their water is cool and clean and their litter area is fresh and inviting at all times.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e3fc38203a5d374eb3ecbb390522ac684ec26968\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3fc38203a5d374eb3ecbb390522ac684ec26968/0_21_1167_1458/800.jpg\" alt=\"190909 GuardianLab PetCats EmmaSinclair Shot 03 053\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeding machines with cameras ensure your cats are being fed when you\u2019re not there.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may sound like bells and whistles, but Sinclair insists the gear is worth it. \u201c[The cats] enhance my life, and I love them an embarrassing amount. They can wake me up in the middle of the night for attention and destroy my lovely sofa, yet I still love them,\u201d she says. As well as tech, Sinclair treats her kitties to cat toys, scratching posts, comfortable baskets, and anything they could possibly want.</p> <p>Dogs have benefited from the pet tech revolution too, and Jeanette McNeish, who has two dogs, relies on gadgetry to support their mental health. Her dogs get anxious and hyperactive, so she subscribes to a service that provides TV and music for pets. \u201cIt really helps with [my dog] Bowie\u2019s anxiety, especially when we leave the house and he gets separation anxiety. So we find that we\u2019re not as worried when we leave him alone. Plus it\u2019s really funny to watch them watching TV,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cthe sheep and virtual dog walks\u201d are their favourite programmes.</p> <p>She also uses <a href=\"https://petcube.com/en-gb/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Petcube</a>, a small cube-shaped camera with Alexa built in to interact with them, watch them, and dispense treats while she\u2019s not around.</p> <p>While our pets rely on us to keep them calm and happy, many of us find that we rely on them for the same reasons. Cats and dogs are proven to be beneficial for people with depression, ADHD, anxiety, and <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/p/pets-and-mental-health\" rel=\"nofollow\">autism</a>, partly because of the sense of purpose and responsibility they give us. Billie can attest to that. She adopted her cat after a long-term relationship broke down, and found that the decision \u201csaved her\u201d. \u201cI suffered a huge mental breakdown, couldn\u2019t leave my flat for months\u201d, she says, adding that on days she felt she couldn\u2019t get out of bed, the incentive to care for her cat gave her a reason to get up. \u201cShe cuddles me to sleep each night, she\u2019s waiting on the stairs for me every day when I get home. She\u2019s incredible company, I don\u2019t know where I would be without her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c257667e15925ea56164bdd6e4722738eb88da75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c257667e15925ea56164bdd6e4722738eb88da75/0_225_1069_1136/941.jpg\" alt=\"Punk Rock Milo, a corgi owned by Elena de Soto, has almost 13,000 followers on Instagram\" width=\"941\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Punk Rock Milo, a corgi owned by Elena de Soto, has almost 13,000 followers on Instagram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @punkrockmilo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Punk Rock Milo, a corgi owned by Elena de Soto, has almost 13,000 followers on Instagram</p></li> </ul> <p>While lifestyles have changed, what remains the same is that humans find cats and dogs irresistibly cute.

De Soto works at a gig venue, and after realising her dog was a hit with bands, started posting photos of them posing with Milo online. \u201cWhen fans are hanging out at the venue during his walk break or when I\u2019m leaving they\u2019re petting him and taking photos of him. We\u2019ve been invited to concerts and events at other venues and festivals. When bands advance their shows, they ask for Milo to be at the venue for photo opportunities,\u201d says de Soto. She adds that she\u2019s careful not to stress Milo out, which is important to remember \u2013 you should never get a dog just to post on social media, and you should never push them to do things that they can\u2019t handle. De Soto says that she and Milo have tons of fun together.</p> <p>In 2019, pet lives seem to be as complex and individual as human ones.

      "bodyText": "Humans have kept cats and dogs as pets for centuries, from deified kitties basking in the ancient Egyptian sun, to wolves nipping at the scraps of early man\u2019s hunting spoils. Until relatively recently, our pets were much more separate from us \u2013 particularly dogs, which weren\u2019t seen as companion animals in the eyes of most families until the 19th century. Now, they are bonafide members of the family. Cats have become more indoor-dwelling too, and owners have altered their environments with scratching posts and litter trays in response. With pet ownership on the rise, cats and dogs are becoming more closely intertwined with our lives. The amount we spend on our pets has gone up too, with the average British household spending more than \u00a33,000 on their dogs each year. There are more things to buy for our pets than ever: designer harnesses, organic dog food, pet cameras, automatic feeders and bedding that looks more comfortable than our own. As our lives get busier, the industry creates more ways to keep pets busy and happy in our absence. \u201cWe humanise our pets more than we used to, from buying them dog beer, to dog-friendly birthday cupcakes, Easter eggs and advent calendars,\u201d says Dr Karlien Heyrman, head of pets at Pets at Home. \u201cPets have become much more part of the family, and as people\u2019s lifestyles have changed, how we care for our pets has changed,\u201d she says. Having pets boosts our oxytocin, which lowers feelings of loneliness and boosts our joy, so, of course, we want to spoil them. According to Heyrman, we use technology to look after our pets more than ever. She cites microchip-operated cat flaps and feeders, activity trackers and cameras as just a few examples, and believes that the market will continue to grow. \u201cI expect a lot of advancements in this area, both to give pet owners more information about their pet and to give the vets looking after the pets more information about their health,\u201d she says. According to Alvexo, pet tech options are becoming more affordable, which their experts believe will make the trend even more mainstream. Emma Sinclair shares a \u201cheavily tech-enabled home\u201d with her three cats One owner who\u2019s ahead of the pet tech trend is Emma Sinclair, a tech entrepreneur who has three rescue cats: Peanut, Lloyd and Schnoo. She has a \u201cheavily tech-enabled home\u201d, which includes feeding machines with cameras, to ensure the cats are being fed and to keep an eye on them when humans aren\u2019t around. Additionally, the cats have an automated litter box and a water machine that keeps their drinks fresh. Sinclair says that as she and her partner lead busy lives, the clever technology ensures her cats are always well looked after: \u201cTechnology of any sort is there for certain reasons: to automate mindless, tedious tasks and to make life easier, so our time can be spent on more important things. We can ensure that they are well fed, their water is cool and clean and their litter area is fresh and inviting at all times.\u201d It may sound like bells and whistles, but Sinclair insists the gear is worth it. \u201c[The cats] enhance my life, and I love them an embarrassing amount. They can wake me up in the middle of the night for attention and destroy my lovely sofa, yet I still love them,\u201d she says. As well as tech, Sinclair treats her kitties to cat toys, scratching posts, comfortable baskets, and anything they could possibly want. Dogs have benefited from the pet tech revolution too, and Jeanette McNeish, who has two dogs, relies on gadgetry to support their mental health. Her dogs get anxious and hyperactive, so she subscribes to a service that provides TV and music for pets. \u201cIt really helps with [my dog] Bowie\u2019s anxiety, especially when we leave the house and he gets separation anxiety. So we find that we\u2019re not as worried when we leave him alone. Plus it\u2019s really funny to watch them watching TV,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cthe sheep and virtual dog walks\u201d are their favourite programmes. She also uses Petcube, a small cube-shaped camera with Alexa built in to interact with them, watch them, and dispense treats while she\u2019s not around. While our pets rely on us to keep them calm and happy, many of us find that we rely on them for the same reasons. Cats and dogs are proven to be beneficial for people with depression, ADHD, anxiety, and autism, partly because of the sense of purpose and responsibility they give us. Billie can attest to that. She adopted her cat after a long-term relationship broke down, and found that the decision \u201csaved her\u201d. \u201cI suffered a huge mental breakdown, couldn\u2019t leave my flat for months\u201d, she says, adding that on days she felt she couldn\u2019t get out of bed, the incentive to care for her cat gave her a reason to get up. \u201cShe cuddles me to sleep each night, she\u2019s waiting on the stairs for me every day when I get home. She\u2019s incredible company, I don\u2019t know where I would be without her.\u201d Punk Rock Milo, a corgi owned by Elena de Soto, has almost 13,000 followers on Instagram While lifestyles have changed, what remains the same is that humans find cats and dogs irresistibly cute. In 2019, we\u2019ve turned that \u201cawww\u201d factor into social media power, and it\u2019s common to find cats and dogs with more Instagram followers than political leaders and celebrities.

Lap-dancing clubs in the UK are legally required to reapply for their licence, and the city\u2019s Spearmint Rhino has been successful in doing so every year since it opened in 2003. But this year, what is usually a routine procedure became a lightning rod for highly charged debates around sex work and feminism.</p> <p>Over the past 12 months, the Spearmint Rhino has been the target of a coalition of feminist groups who have campaigned against its licence being renewed, on the grounds that strip clubs sexually objectify women and act as a prostitution grooming ground for vulnerable young women. </p> <p>Last February, the group <a href=\"https://notbuyingit.org.uk/background/\" title=\"\">Not Buying It</a> paid men to go into Spearmint Rhinos in London and Sheffield, buy lap dances and film naked women without their consent. This footage was then presented to Sheffield council by the Women\u2019s Equality party as proof of multiple breaches of the club\u2019s code of conduct. The council\u2019s licensing committee subsequently launched an inquiry and found that six dancers had sexually touched themselves, each other and/or the customers. But despite these breaches, Sheffield council agreed to renew Spearmint Rhino\u2019s licence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/10/blowin-up-documentary-sex-workers-court\">'I see myself in them': the documentary that humanizes sex workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tactics employed by the club\u2019s opponents are well established and \u2013 unlike in this case \u2013 usually successful. Campaigns to revoke the licences of strip clubs on the grounds that they exploit women and attract sexually depraved men are nothing new. One of the earliest campaigns was led by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice which was established in 1873, and targeted burlesque theatres, calling them the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3704140?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" title=\"\">habitats of sex crazed perverts</a>\u201d. Anti-vice activists would sneak into the clubs and report the \u201cdisorderly\u201d and \u201clewd\u201d acts they saw on stage to the licensing committee, demanding the venue\u2019s licence be revoked.</p> <p> They finally succeeded in their mission in 1942, when the licences of the last three burlesque clubs in Manhattan were revoked.</p> <p>The tactics employed by the society and groups such as Not Buying It are virtually identical. But what has changed in the intervening 77 years is that the sex workers at the centre of these debates are finally being allowed to speak for themselves.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, Sheffield council\u2019s licensing committee voted to renew the licence of the Spearmint Rhino lap-dancing club until next April. Lap-dancing clubs in the UK are legally required to reapply for their licence, and the city\u2019s Spearmint Rhino has been successful in doing so every year since it opened in 2003. But this year, what is usually a routine procedure became a lightning rod for highly charged debates around sex work and feminism. Over the past 12 months, the Spearmint Rhino has been the target of a coalition of feminist groups who have campaigned against its licence being renewed, on the grounds that strip clubs sexually objectify women and act as a prostitution grooming ground for vulnerable young women. Last February, the group Not Buying It paid men to go into Spearmint Rhinos in London and Sheffield, buy lap dances and film naked women without their consent. This footage was then presented to Sheffield council by the Women\u2019s Equality party as proof of multiple breaches of the club\u2019s code of conduct. The council\u2019s licensing committee subsequently launched an inquiry and found that six dancers had sexually touched themselves, each other and/or the customers. But despite these breaches, Sheffield council agreed to renew Spearmint Rhino\u2019s licence. The tactics employed by the club\u2019s opponents are well established and \u2013 unlike in this case \u2013 usually successful. Campaigns to revoke the licences of strip clubs on the grounds that they exploit women and attract sexually depraved men are nothing new. One of the earliest campaigns was led by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice which was established in 1873, and targeted burlesque theatres, calling them the \u201chabitats of sex crazed perverts\u201d. Anti-vice activists would sneak into the clubs and report the \u201cdisorderly\u201d and \u201clewd\u201d acts they saw on stage to the licensing committee, demanding the venue\u2019s licence be revoked. They finally succeeded in their mission in 1942, when the licences of the last three burlesque clubs in Manhattan were revoked. The tactics employed by the society and groups such as Not Buying It are virtually identical. But what has changed in the intervening 77 years is that the sex workers at the centre of these debates are finally being allowed to speak for themselves. And to the surprise of many feminist groups, it turns out that they do not want saving. Nor do they seem particularly grateful to their would-be saviours for campaigning on their behalf to do them out of a job. In fact, they appear to be downright angry about have-a-go rescue missions that involve secretly filming them naked, then outing them to members of local licensing committees. There\u2019s nothing new about the rescue dynamic. Sympathy for the plight of the \u201cfallen woman\u201d, and a need to save her, was endemic in Victorian newspapers. Hundreds of charitable organisations were established throughout the 19th century to rescue and reform such women. The voice of the sex worker is noticeably absent in much of this historical debate, but on the rare occasion it is heard, it frequently offered a very different perspective, as it does today. In a series of letters written to the Times in 1858, an anonymous sex worker, referring to herself as \u201cAnother Unfortunate\u201d, challenges the widespread assumption that all sex workers are an \u201cabandoned sisterhood\u201d. The tone of Another Unfortunate is defiant, proud and attacks the paternalistic moralising of the groups who wish to save her. \u201cYou railers for the Society for the Suppression of Vice, you the pious, the moral, the respectable, as you call yourselves, who stand on your smooth and pleasant side of the great gulf you have dug and keep between yourselves and the dregs, why don\u2019t you bridge it over, or fill it up, and by some humane and generous process absorb us into your leavened mass, until we become interpenetrated with goodness like yourselves?\u201d she wrote. The letter caused something of an embarrassment for Charles Dickens who was the patron of Urania Cottage, a home for fallen women. Dickens had not read the article in full and wrote to the newspaper\u2019s editor to ask for the name of the author \u201cwith the view of doing good to someone\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Politician The first fruits of Ryan Murphy\u2019s $300m production deal with Netflix come to light with this black comedy on the sociopathically ambitious Payton Hobart (Ben Platt) and his dream to become the next US president. Each season follows a different election race, starting with a backstabbing-filled fight for high-school student body president. From Friday, Netflix Transparent: Musicale Finale With the show\u2019s lead Jeffrey Tambor fired amid sexual harassment claims, creator Jill Soloway ends Transparent with a daringly inventive musical extravaganza. A joyously moving end for the forward-thinking show. From Friday, Amazon Prime Video Tories at War A compelling deep dive into how the Conservatives have unravelled at the seams during Brexit. Featuring contributions from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage, it is an absorbing yet often frustrating look at the figures who lie behind the headlines. Sunday, 10pm, Channel 4 Stath Lets Flats It\u2019s time for the annual Haringey Letting Awards and estate agent Stath \u2013 writer and creator Jamie Demetriou \u2013 is in pole position for most improved agency, following a slick local ad campaign. At least he thinks so, until sister Sophie steals the show in this cringe-fuelled, gag-packed finale to the show\u2019s second season. Monday, 10pm, Channel 4 Live: The Circle The reality show for amateur catfishers returns for a second series, presented by Emma Willis. In this launch show, the first eight players enter the apartment block where they\u2019ll be hoping to live for the next eight weeks, competing with each other through The Circle \u2013 a social media site where players fight for likes and try to avoid getting \u201cblocked\u201d. Phones at the ready as viewers can get involved, too. Tuesday, 9pm, Channel 4 The $50 Million Art Swindle It was one of the largest art heists ever committed and fraudster Michel Cohen seemed to have gotten away with it. Vanessa Engle\u2019s doc \u2013 Cohen\u2019s first recorded appearance since 2003 \u2013 questions his guilt, greed and authenticity. Monday, 9pm, BBC Two Passenger List An impressive cast leads this new mystery series on a plane which goes missing between London and New York. Kaitlin (Kelly Marie Tran) plays a student searching for the truth, as her twin brother was a passenger on the flight. Broadway star Patti LuPone and Merlin\u2019s Colin Morgan also star in a slow-building, suspenseful audio thriller. Podcast Joan Armatrading: Me, Myself, I Hit-machine singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading defies her reclusive reputation to candidly discuss her childhood, career and success in a compelling one-off documentary. She reflects poignantly on the racism and misogyny of the music industry and the process of her genre-defying lyrical craft. Friday, 9pm, BBC Four The Seventh Seal Ingmar Bergman\u2019s haunting 1956 masterpiece is set in a dark age of war and plague, where Max von Sydow\u2019s knight challenges the grim reaper (pallid Bengt Ekerot) to a life-or-death game of chess. A morality play composed with matchless imagery, it was a pioneer of arthouse cinema \u2013 and was brilliantly parodied in Bill &amp; Ted\u2019s Bogus Journey.

      "body": "<p>Akinola Davies travels light. Really light. \u201cMy friends joke about it because whenever I travel I literally take a bag, like a backpack, even if I\u2019m going for a week or two,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really liberating. It kind of enables the mind to focus on being present.\u201d</p> <p>That focus is important because Davies, 35, is a renaissance man. Born in London and raised in Nigeria, he\u2019s a tastemaker with an uncanny ability to harness community and predict the zeitgeist.</p> <p>His work as a film-maker, photographer and DJ touches on multiple facets of culture, including fashion, music and fine art, regularly provoking conversations about social and political issues. He has made a film for Kenzo, celebrating his Nigerian heritage and the country\u2019s youth, and has directed a documentary series for the BBC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10d5163bb08e60fddcf2ad26a131b6b066796993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10d5163bb08e60fddcf2ad26a131b6b066796993/0_0_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Akinola Davies.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Akinola Davies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan WIlton/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year, his film Boot/Leg became the subject of a solo exhibition at Art Basel in Switzerland, and his first US solo exhibition opened in Washington DC in April.

      "bodyText": "Akinola Davies travels light. Really light. \u201cMy friends joke about it because whenever I travel I literally take a bag, like a backpack, even if I\u2019m going for a week or two,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really liberating. It kind of enables the mind to focus on being present.\u201d That focus is important because Davies, 35, is a renaissance man. Born in London and raised in Nigeria, he\u2019s a tastemaker with an uncanny ability to harness community and predict the zeitgeist. His work as a film-maker, photographer and DJ touches on multiple facets of culture, including fashion, music and fine art, regularly provoking conversations about social and political issues. He has made a film for Kenzo, celebrating his Nigerian heritage and the country\u2019s youth, and has directed a documentary series for the BBC. Last year, his film Boot/Leg became the subject of a solo exhibition at Art Basel in Switzerland, and his first US solo exhibition opened in Washington DC in April. Now he\u2019s got a couple of \u201clong form\u201d projects in the pipeline, but doesn\u2019t want to jinx them by discussing them prematurely. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in trying to see how my work, or the way I look at things, would be interpreted in a different field,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s clamouring for video at the moment, but there\u2019s always been a symbiotic relationship with fashion and music and theatre and dance and performance.\u201d While some creatives use fashion as a means of expression, Davies expects his clothes to work as hard as he does, hence the lean approach to packing.

      "body": "<p>Staff at Amnesty International are to vote on whether to strike over a dispute about redundancies.</p> <p>The trade union Unite will ballot its 300 members at the human rights organisation next week.</p> <p>In June, Amnesty announced it was planning to cut 146 posts, which would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/06/amnesty-international-to-make-almost-100-staff-redundant\">result in 93 job losses</a>, after admitting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/27/amnesty-international-staff-braced-for-redundancies\">\u00a317m hole</a> in its budget to the end of 2020.</p> <p>A number of voluntary redundancies and a recruitment freeze since 2018 have reduced the number of job losses to 20, said the organisation, adding that it was confident cuts could be reduced further through redeployment. </p> <p>The news follows a difficult period at the organisation. An independent report in February this year described its workplace as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/amnesty-international-has-toxic-working-culture-report-finds\">\u201ctoxic\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Amnesty said the union\u2019s course of action was disappointing.</p> <p>Unite believes the proposed cuts will \u201cgreatly reduce\u201d the charity\u2019s ability to deliver critical human rights work, and will result in the loss of expertise.</p> <p>The union said it had no option but to ballot its members, given management\u2019s refusal to consider using donations to keep people in work, rather than using them to boost reserves. The organisation has 755 staff.</p> <p>Alan Scott, Unite\u2019s regional co-ordinating officer, said: \u201cUnite has exhausted all the available dispute resolution options open to it, including meetings at the conciliation service Acas.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, Amnesty\u2019s management has refused to countenance reducing the amount of money being pumped into reserves in order to save jobs, and therefore members felt they had no option but to ballot for industrial action.</p> <p>\u201cAmnesty\u2019s management can still have the opportunity to prevent industrial action by tabling proposals that redundancies will be avoided by using a fraction of its reserves.\u201d</p> <p>Unite said the redundancies were a direct result of overspending by the senior management team.</p> <p>A spokesman for Amnesty said: \u201cIt is disappointing that Unite has decided to ballot its members employed by Amnesty International for industrial action. However, we fully recognise and support Amnesty International employees\u2019 right to strike.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very grateful to everyone who has engaged constructively with the consultation and enabled us to reduce the number of redundancies. Nonetheless, this provides little solace to those at risk of losing their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWe deeply regret that these redundancies have been made necessary due to harsh financial realities and the need to put the secretariat on to a more stable footing for the future. This is a painful and difficult decision, and we will do everything in our power to support impacted staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/06/amnesty-international-to-make-almost-100-staff-redundant\">Amnesty International to make almost 100 staff redundant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRegrettably, we do not have the option to further reduce the level of reserve as it is at the absolute minimum to ensure the fiscal future of the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>One insider at Amnesty said the threatened redundancies were the \u201cfinal straw\u201d for many staff at the organisation, who feel they have been treated badly.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had damning wellbeing reports one after another.

      "bodyText": "Staff at Amnesty International are to vote on whether to strike over a dispute about redundancies. The trade union Unite will ballot its 300 members at the human rights organisation next week. In June, Amnesty announced it was planning to cut 146 posts, which would result in 93 job losses, after admitting a \u00a317m hole in its budget to the end of 2020. A number of voluntary redundancies and a recruitment freeze since 2018 have reduced the number of job losses to 20, said the organisation, adding that it was confident cuts could be reduced further through redeployment. The news follows a difficult period at the organisation. An independent report in February this year described its workplace as \u201ctoxic\u201d. Amnesty said the union\u2019s course of action was disappointing. Unite believes the proposed cuts will \u201cgreatly reduce\u201d the charity\u2019s ability to deliver critical human rights work, and will result in the loss of expertise. The union said it had no option but to ballot its members, given management\u2019s refusal to consider using donations to keep people in work, rather than using them to boost reserves. The organisation has 755 staff. Alan Scott, Unite\u2019s regional co-ordinating officer, said: \u201cUnite has exhausted all the available dispute resolution options open to it, including meetings at the conciliation service Acas. \u201cUnfortunately, Amnesty\u2019s management has refused to countenance reducing the amount of money being pumped into reserves in order to save jobs, and therefore members felt they had no option but to ballot for industrial action. \u201cAmnesty\u2019s management can still have the opportunity to prevent industrial action by tabling proposals that redundancies will be avoided by using a fraction of its reserves.\u201d Unite said the redundancies were a direct result of overspending by the senior management team. A spokesman for Amnesty said: \u201cIt is disappointing that Unite has decided to ballot its members employed by Amnesty International for industrial action. However, we fully recognise and support Amnesty International employees\u2019 right to strike. \u201cWe are very grateful to everyone who has engaged constructively with the consultation and enabled us to reduce the number of redundancies. Nonetheless, this provides little solace to those at risk of losing their jobs. \u201cWe deeply regret that these redundancies have been made necessary due to harsh financial realities and the need to put the secretariat on to a more stable footing for the future. This is a painful and difficult decision, and we will do everything in our power to support impacted staff. \u201cRegrettably, we do not have the option to further reduce the level of reserve as it is at the absolute minimum to ensure the fiscal future of the organisation.\u201d One insider at Amnesty said the threatened redundancies were the \u201cfinal straw\u201d for many staff at the organisation, who feel they have been treated badly. \u201cWe\u2019ve had damning wellbeing reports one after another. But the way they are conducting the consultation, we feel no lessons have been learned,\u201d another source said. The crisis at Amnesty emerged last year when Ga\u00ebtan Mootoo, 65, a senior researcher, killed himself at his Paris office, leaving a note blaming work pressures and a lack of support from management. His death was followed by several reviews. One, conducted by James Laddie QC, found that \u201ca serious failure of management\u201d had contributed to Mootoo\u2019s death. A subsequent independent review of workplace culture found a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d at the organisation after a restructuring process.",

Greta Thunberg and school students lead worldwide protest Students and adults across America are joining a worldwide day of protest over the climate crisis on Friday, with strikes planned at more than 1,000 schools and workplaces in the US, the country\u2019s largest ever mass climate demonstration. The global movement\u2019s young figurehead, Greta Thunberg, will speak at a march in New York. The Guardian\u2019s view: her message is simple and unignorable. In case you\u2019re still not convinced, here is the climate crisis explained in 10 charts \u2013 and here\u2019s how you can get involved. Global health. The climate crisis is the biggest threat to global health over the next quarter-century, and governments are failing to prepare, according to a survey of the top medics who make up the membership of Britain\u2019s Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Waterfront woes. New York City is taking action to protect the Lower Manhattan waterfront from the looming impact of climate change. But low-income residents who live by the water in other boroughs will have to fend for themselves, as Emily Nonko reports.

Whistleblower rumours focus on Ukraine amid Giuliani claims A whistleblower complaint submitted by a US intelligence official, who was unusually troubled by a promise Donald Trump had made to a foreign leader in a phone call, was connected to Ukraine, according to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times. The foreign leader in question has not been identified, but the complaint was reportedly filed weeks before Trump spoke to the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Digging for dirt. Speaking to CNN on Thursday, the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, admitted asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice-president and 2020 presidential hopeful, Joe Biden, whose son once had a role in a Ukrainian gas company. Iran rhetoric. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has dialled down the administration\u2019s aggressive rhetoric in the wake of the recent attack on a Saudi oil facility, saying Washington wants a \u201cpeaceful resolution\u201d with Iran, whom it blames for the attack. Trudeau \u2018can\u2019t recall\u2019 how many times he wore blackface Justin Trudeau has admitted he is \u201cwary of being definitive\u201d about the number of times he donned blackface as a young man, as the Canadian prime minister fights for his political life following the emergence of three separate, historical images of him wearing the racist makeup.

Political future. The blackface images have shattered Trudeau\u2019s carefully curated image as a progressive leader, but the controversy may not shift the election needle as much as Canada\u2019s Conservatives hope, as Leyland Cecco reports from Toronto. Cheat sheet Two people have died and at least 1,000 needed rescuing after the remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda brought an estimated 40in of rain to parts of Texas in less than 72 hours, making it the seventh-wettest tropical cyclone in US history. The Los Angeles political activist and Democratic donor Ed Buck had at least 10 victims and preyed on gay, black homeless men, forcibly injecting them with fatal doses of drugs, according to court records released after his arrest this week. A study suggests the mystery illness known as Havana syndrome, which afflicted US and Canadian diplomats in Cuba between 2016 and 2018, may have been caused by mosquito fumigation \u2013 and not, as the Trump administration claimed, by \u201csonic attacks\u201d. Grassroots progressive organisers in partnership with the Guardian will on Saturday host their first \u201cpeople\u2019s forum\u201d in Iowa, featuring Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and several other Democratic 2020 candidates \u2013 though not the frontrunner, Joe Biden.

With an almost unmatched capacity to adapt, mosquitoes have spread to virtually every corner of the globe, carrying the diseases that make them humankind\u2019s deadliest predator by far. We might soon be able to eradicate all 110 trillion of them. Timothy Winegard asks whether we should. How my father gained \u2013 and then lost \u2013 unlimited free air travel In 1987, Caroline Rothstein\u2019s father became one of only a few dozen people to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass, letting him fly first-class anywhere in the world on American Airlines for the rest of his life.

Microsoft has already voluntarily imposed limits on how and to whom it sells the technology, he says, and he encourages other firms to do the same. \u201cWe\u2019re not willing to allow our facial recognition services to be used for mass surveillance \u2026 so if we thought that the US government or that [US immigration agency] Ice was going to deploy facial recognition for mass surveillance, we would object to that and I don\u2019t think we would do it.</p> <p>\u201cIf an agency in any government wants to deploy facial recognition in a manner that we believe will result in unfair bias and discrimination, that\u2019s something that we won\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>The conversation around the technology has advanced rapidly, even in the gap between Smith finishing the manuscript and the book hitting shelves. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an issue evolve as quickly as facial recognition has,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s a lot of food for thought in that. I say that in part because we feel it deeply ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was just 13 months ago where we published a blogpost where we said: \u2018This is technology that is going to need to be regulated.\u2019 The reaction in Silicon Valley was like: \u2018What is wrong with you people at Microsoft, why are you doing this?\u2019 And then look at where we are now: we just saw the city of San Francisco, next door to Silicon Valley, ban public sector use of facial recognition.\u201d</p> <p>But, although Smith calls for regulation generally, he argues against an all-out ban. \u201cThe first question one should ask is why, why is this happening? It is a technology that can be deployed in, literally, an Orwellian fashion. But I think whenever you want to ban a technology, you also have to ask, well, what are the potentials for it to do good as well? And so then the question is how do you strike the balance? I don\u2019t think that you strike that balance by banning all use. You strike that balance by banning the harmful use.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I respect the people who call for a moratorium, because implicit, or maybe explicit, in the word moratorium is the notion that this will not last forever. I worry about moratoriums nonetheless, just because it can make it more difficult to learn how to use the technology well if you can\u2019t put the technology to use. But I respect that point of view.\u201d</p> <p>A month after Smith spoke to the Guardian, 76 protesters <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/14/us/anti-ice-protesters-arrested/index.html\">were arrested picketing the Manhattan Microsoft store</a> with signs reading \u201cNo Business With Ice\u201d, as part of the Close The Camps movement which demands an end to detention centres for migrants. The protest organisers told CNN that \u201cit is our responsibility to hold US corporations accountable \u2026 in the racist torture and trauma that is being inflicted. We have the power to end this cruelty.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, Smith describes Microsoft\u2019s contract with Ice as a surprise to many in the company.

Nor, thank goodness, was Microsoft working on any projects to separate children from their families at the border.\u201d</p> <p>Smith says he distinguishes the sale of technology such as facial recognition from the more mundane productivity software that Microsoft does supply to Ice, and to other controversial state actors around the world.</p> <p>\u201cOne must assume responsibility for how your products are used in specific, well-defined, clearcut and relatively narrow ways. I think it\u2019s a different situation to try to deny access to all technology because you disagree with what people are doing in their lives or with their businesses, or as a government.

She walks down the garden, pointing out neighbour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/24/don-letts-windrush-stirred-up-some-deep-emotions-i-walked-down-the-street-practically-crying\" title=\"\">Don Letts</a>\u2019 studio over the hedge, next to the bunker-like studio where she recorded both her albums.

As well as staples Depeche Mode, house and techno, she studied Kate Bush, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. \u201cI was like: \u2018Why are these good songs? Let\u2019s try and write songs like these.\u2019 It took a year and a half to really get that down.\u201d</p> <p>Barnes had already waited to start her solo career, so another 18 months was negligible. She went to the Brit school, first for theatre, then music, and chafed against the mainstream pop curriculum; she was more interested in the music she was discovering from India and Africa. She felt lost after completing her studies. Then she had a revelation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/sep/01/africa-express-glastonbury-video-2007\" title=\"\">at Glastonbury 2007</a> after stumbling upon the five-hour live debut of Damon Albarn\u2019s Africa Express. \u201cTinariwen, never heard of them before,\u201d she recalls. \u201cDamon, Amadou and Mariam, Toumani Diabat\u00e9, the Somalian rapper K\u2019naan.\u201d She stayed for the whole thing. \u201cIt changed my life.\u201d</p> <p>It prompted her to study ethnomusicology at Soas University of London, her studies running alongside her burgeoning career as a session drummer for the likes of the producer Kwes and later Kate Tempest. If the Brit school had been good for anything, it was centring her in south London\u2019s music scene at a fertile moment. Barnes recalls one early <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/\" title=\"\">Boiler Room</a> session that could be her generation\u2019s equivalent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/14/sex-pistols-lesser-free-hall\" title=\"\">Sex Pistols playing the Lesser Free Trade Hall</a>. \u201cKwes was DJing.

Domino caught on and signed her in late 2014. Suddenly she had a deal and was out on tour while coping with the breakdown of her parents\u2019 marriage. \u201cI felt like everything was spiralling a bit out of control,\u201d says Barnes. She was drinking too much. \u201cAs a drummer, I was always known as a wildcard but that was part of my charm. I was always on time and reliable, then liked to be wild and party a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Binge-drinking went hand-in-hand with binge-eating. \u201cI had put on so much weight,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that being overweight is worrying, but for somebody who had never been overweight, I was quite worried, my mum was quite worried.\u201d After one particularly toxic bender, her friends staged an intervention. Barnes decided to \u201cbe sober for as long as I could do it for, just to change my view of alcohol\u201d.</p> <p>She did not drink for two years \u2013 the whole time she was making Seeking Thrills \u2013 and rarely does now. But she still went clubbing, marvelling at the sights in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/berghain-club-bouncer-sven-marquardt-memoirs-berlin?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">Berghain</a>, Berlin while sober. \u201cThat\u2019s what worked so well for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I was extreme about giving up alcohol, but not about giving up that whole side of my life.\u201d She got healthy \u2013 going vegan, doing yoga and having early nights \u2013 and figured out what made her happy. She realised that being a session drummer was all about serving other people: \u201cMaking sure the artist was OK, not causing any trouble. Seven years of that made me not really care about myself. Then suddenly, putting out my own music, it was like: \u2018Oh my God, hang on \u2013 how am I supposed to <em>be</em> in this?\u2019 I had to really work on it.\u201d</p> <p>There is a clear difference in clarity between Barnes\u2019s albums. The debut cleaved closely to her Soas studies, the pan-global samples and tentative lyrics recalling a defanged MIA. She is bolder on Seeking Thrills, the music more distinctive and rallying. You could see Barnes had come into her own from her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p07d9pjs/glastonbury-georgia-live-at-glastonbury\" title=\"\">superb one-woman set</a> at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. When she wasn\u2019t battering her striking Simmons electronic kit (she was inspired by vintage footage of Depeche Mode and Sly and Robbie playing them), she was jumping off the drum riser to literally bounce with glee, drumsticks crossed overhead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozLaujDy7jE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ozLaujDy7jE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Georgia: Never Let You Go \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She says the Prodigy influenced her performance style. \u201cI remember Keith Flint saying he didn\u2019t wanna think about what he was having for tea while he was on stage, he wanted to work!\u201d She laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do. I want people to come out going: \u2018She\u2019s doing it all herself? That\u2019s mad!\u2019 The audience get on your side if you\u2019re showing them that much work.\u201d</p> <p>Her ethos is panning out. Twelve years after Africa Express changed her life at Glastonbury, Barnes was invited to be part of its latest album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/14/africa-express-egoli-review-johannesburg-damon-albarn\" title=\"\">Egoli</a> (\u201cmy proudest moment\u201d). She is helping the Black Madonna produce her debut album, and working with the Flaming Lips\u2019 Wayne Coyne, a close friend she met at a festival. Plus Seeking Thrills is not even out for four months. Quiet year, then. \u201cFuckin\u2019 \u2019ell!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI know. It\u2019s mad, innit.\u201d</p> <p>The kiwi tree emits another sulphuric waft. \u201cI\u2019ve got a real connection to this record,\u201d she says, reflectively. \u201cI feel like it really means a lot because they were transformative years. I\u2019ve enjoyed every single moment of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Never Let You Go is out now on Domino. The album Seeking Thrills is released on 10 January.</p>",

I was always on time and reliable, then liked to be wild and party a lot.\u201d Binge-drinking went hand-in-hand with binge-eating. \u201cI had put on so much weight,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that being overweight is worrying, but for somebody who had never been overweight, I was quite worried, my mum was quite worried.\u201d After one particularly toxic bender, her friends staged an intervention. Barnes decided to \u201cbe sober for as long as I could do it for, just to change my view of alcohol\u201d. She did not drink for two years \u2013 the whole time she was making Seeking Thrills \u2013 and rarely does now. But she still went clubbing, marvelling at the sights in Berghain, Berlin while sober. \u201cThat\u2019s what worked so well for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I was extreme about giving up alcohol, but not about giving up that whole side of my life.\u201d She got healthy \u2013 going vegan, doing yoga and having early nights \u2013 and figured out what made her happy. She realised that being a session drummer was all about serving other people: \u201cMaking sure the artist was OK, not causing any trouble. Seven years of that made me not really care about myself. Then suddenly, putting out my own music, it was like: \u2018Oh my God, hang on \u2013 how am I supposed to be in this?\u2019 I had to really work on it.\u201d There is a clear difference in clarity between Barnes\u2019s albums. The debut cleaved closely to her Soas studies, the pan-global samples and tentative lyrics recalling a defanged MIA. She is bolder on Seeking Thrills, the music more distinctive and rallying. You could see Barnes had come into her own from her superb one-woman set at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. When she wasn\u2019t battering her striking Simmons electronic kit (she was inspired by vintage footage of Depeche Mode and Sly and Robbie playing them), she was jumping off the drum riser to literally bounce with glee, drumsticks crossed overhead. She says the Prodigy influenced her performance style. \u201cI remember Keith Flint saying he didn\u2019t wanna think about what he was having for tea while he was on stage, he wanted to work!\u201d She laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do. I want people to come out going: \u2018She\u2019s doing it all herself? That\u2019s mad!\u2019 The audience get on your side if you\u2019re showing them that much work.\u201d Her ethos is panning out. Twelve years after Africa Express changed her life at Glastonbury, Barnes was invited to be part of its latest album, Egoli (\u201cmy proudest moment\u201d). She is helping the Black Madonna produce her debut album, and working with the Flaming Lips\u2019 Wayne Coyne, a close friend she met at a festival. Plus Seeking Thrills is not even out for four months. Quiet year, then. \u201cFuckin\u2019 \u2019ell!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI know. It\u2019s mad, innit.\u201d The kiwi tree emits another sulphuric waft. \u201cI\u2019ve got a real connection to this record,\u201d she says, reflectively. \u201cI feel like it really means a lot because they were transformative years. I\u2019ve enjoyed every single moment of it.\u201d \u2022 Never Let You Go is out now on Domino. The album Seeking Thrills is released on 10 January.",

The union said pilots were seeking recognition of sacrifices they had made for BA during years when the company was making a loss, given BA was recording profits of more than \u00a32bn a year. Meanwhile, UK pilots at Ryanair have called off five days of strikes scheduled over the next nine days \u2013 on 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 September \u2013 after failing to affect operations in three days of walkouts this week. Balpa said it was \u201ctaking the moral high ground\u201d in ending the strikes, although it said relations were \u201cacrimonious\u201d. The union said: \u201cInstead of engaging in negotiations Ryanair has reverted to type, electing to punish pilots by withdrawing their travel benefits.\u201d It did not rule out setting new strike dates if talks did not take place.",

The BBC was passed details of a number of incidents by an anonymous Twitter user, and it highlighted more than 20 new cases to the Conservative party after independently verifying them. Incidents were said to have ranged from individuals \u201cliking\u201d Islamophobic pictures or statements on one or two occasions, to people who said they were Tory members regularly posting anti-Muslim content. The government minister Kwasi Kwarteng said on Friday that action had been taken when the members were suspended, but he did not directly respond to a question on whether he thought an independent inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservative party was necessary. \u201cI think the party has enough structure and discipline and focus to try to deal with this problem in the first instance,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cObviously this is something that is ongoing. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly when we will be able to announce what structures we have in order to expel or maintain the suspension of these members, but there is no doubt that we took very summary action when we found out last night what had been going on.\u201d Announcements of the suspensions came as the former Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim said that senior Conservative party members, including a serving minister, had made Islamophobic remarks about him. \u201cI have experienced conversations taking place with Islamophobic content directly about me, being conducted by very senior members of the Conservative party \u2013 in fact parliamentarians, one of whom is in fact a serving minister at this moment in time,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cUltimately, this is about values and if we allow Islamophobia, or any other form of discrimination, to go unchecked, what we are doing actually is undermining our own values.\u201d Karim did not reveal the name of the minister in question but said he would provide it to the Conservative party if it wanted to investigate the alleged incident. In May, the Muslim Council of Britain urged the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservative party after it was reported it was dealing with more than 100 alleged cases, including a host of previously unreported ones. \u201cWe are not surprised by the latest revelations,\u201d said Harun Khan, the secretary general of the MCB. \u201cThey are a manifestation of institutional Islamophobia within the Conservative party, and corroborate the polling done demonstrating the scale of the issue. \u201cAn independent and specific inquiry into Islamophobia specifically is long overdue.

      "bodyText": "Protesters took to the streets of more than 250 towns and cities across Spain on Friday night to declare a \u201cfeminist emergency\u201d after a series of high-profile rape cases and a summer in which 19 women were murdered by current or former partners. Organisers urged participants to \u201cturn the night purple\u201d \u2013 the colour of the feminist movement \u2013 to raise the alarm and protest against apathy, indifference and a lack of attention from politicians and the media. By 8pm, people were massing for demonstrations in cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, Tarragona, Salamanca, Seville and Alicante. So far this year, 42 women have been murdered in domestic violence attacks and 32 children left motherless. Since the government began recording such murders in 2003, 1,017 women have been killed by their current or former partners. The demonstrations come three years after the notorious gang-rape of a woman at the running of the bulls festival in Pamplona and amid the trial of seven men accused of raping a 14-year-old girl in Catalonia. \u201cThis has been a summer dominated by barbarity, murders, rapes, assault, paedophilia and gang attacks,\u201d said the protests\u2019 organisers, Feminist Emergency. \u201cThe gender-based violence of the summer has led to the worst figures in more than a decade. We can\u2019t let another school or parliamentary term begin as if nothing has happened. To do so would be to tolerate the intolerable \u2026 This is an emergency.\u201d The organisers called on people to assemble with candles, lanterns, torches and mobile phones to let \u201cfeminism fill the night\u201d. Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, socialist party leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, tweeted his support for Friday\u2019s protests. \u201cTonight will be purple,\u201d he said. \u201cThe streets of our country will fill with light against sexist violence because Spanish society\u2019s commitment is firm: when it comes to violence against women, not a single step backwards.\u201d The Pamplona attack \u2013 known as the \u201cwolf pack\u201d case after the name the rapists gave themselves \u2013 shocked Spain and provoked a fierce debate over the country\u2019s sexual offences legislation. There were furious protests around the country after the judges presiding over the original trial cleared the five of gang-rape and convicted them only of the lesser charge of sexual abuse. In June, Spain\u2019s supreme court overturned the regional court\u2019s verdict, ruled that the men had committed rape, and raised their sentences from nine to 15 years each. Parallels have been drawn between that case and the trial of the six men who are alleged to have raped a 14-year-old girl in the Catalan town of Manresa. While prosecutors had initially argued the defendants should face charges of sexual assault rather than rape because the girl was drunk, under the influence of drugs and did not fight back, they upgraded the charges to rape on Monday. Despite the outcry and anger provoked by such cases, Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party has called for the repeal of domestic violence laws and attacked \u201cpsychopathic feminazis\u201d. On Thursday, the party boycotted the minute\u2019s silence that Madrid city council had called to mark the murder of the latest victim of domestic violence, Adaliz Villagra. Villagra, 31, was stabbed to death in front of her two children in the capital on Tuesday. Vox\u2019s decision to boycott the event and instead turn up with a sign reading \u201cViolence has no gender\u201d prompted a public row between Madrid\u2019s conservative mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, and Javier Ortega Smith, Vox\u2019s general secretary.",

      "bodyText": "Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, has ordered his government to postpone the ratification of a deeply controversial criminal code that would outlaw living together outside marriage, extramarital sex and insulting the president. The apparent climbdown came in a surprise address at the state palace on Friday afternoon, and follows an outpouring of anger and criticism about the draconian draft laws. \u201cI have ordered the law and human rights minister to convey this decision to parliament, to delay the confirmation of the criminal code bill,\u201d the president, better known as Jokowi, told a televised news conference. He said he had decided the bill needed further review after taking into account input from various groups who objected to parts of it. The Indonesian parliament has spent decades revising its colonial-era criminal code, creating a 628-article draft bill that it was due to be put to a vote on Tuesday. More than 300,000 people had signed a petition calling for Jokowi to step in and stop the bill from being passed. The draft penal code applied to everyone in Indonesia, including foreigners, although it was not clear how it would be enforced in holiday hotspots such as Bali. Australia updated its travel advice to warn its citizens of the possible changes. Activists said it would usher in sweeping changes to Indonesian law that would be disastrous for women, religious and sexual minorities in particular, as well as for press freedom. \u201cThis is a moment he will be remembered for,\u201d the petition\u2019s author and women\u2019s rights activist Tunggal Pawestri said before Jokowi\u2019s statement on Friday. \u201cWhat legacy does Jokowi want to have? As a president who is remembered for including a dictatorial and anti-human rights agenda in the penal code? If he really cares about his image as a president of the people then he needs to follow the voice of the people.\u201d Among the provisions in the draft code are articles that would outlaw de-facto relationships and extramarital sex, which activists fear would in effect criminalise same-sex relations. Insulting the president would become a criminal offence punishable by three and a half years in prison. Using the hashtag #semuabisakena, meaning \u201cthis effects everyone\u201d, the petition highlights problematic articles, including those that would also criminalise buskers, beggars and sex workers. The petition also notes an article in the proposed code that refers to \u201cliving law\u201d, which Human Rights Watch says could be interpreted to legitimise hundreds of discriminatory sharia bylaws already in place at the local level. \u201cThis petition has attracted the attention of a lot of people who have realised, this is the situation that we will have if this bill is passed,\u201d said Pawestri. Pawestri first started the petition in January 2018 to focus on how the draft penal code \u2013 which has been decades in the making \u2013 would negatively affect women and LGBT people, but in recent months it has morphed into a more broad critique, garnering more than 440,000 signatures. The bill exposed the fault line between liberals and an increasingly socially conservative society in the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation. Rights groups said the proposals underscored a growing shift towards fundamentalism in a country long hailed for its religious tolerance. Indonesia\u2019s Aceh province already imposes Islamic law, and whipping is a common punishment for a range of offences including gambling, drinking alcohol, and having gay or pre-marital sex. The proposals call for a wider interpretation of Indonesia\u2019s blasphemy law, under which members of religious minority groups, including Christians and Buddhists, have been prosecuted in the past. Civil society groups said they submitted comprehensive recommendations and revisions to the draft code that were largely ignored. On Thursday, hundreds protested outside the parliament, rejecting not only the draft penal code, but also a controversial law passed this week on an anti-corruption commission, which is widely expected to weaken the body\u2019s investigative powers. The parliament \u2013 the source of more than 20 corruption suspects in recent years \u2013 has been derided for passing that law in secrecy and in record time. Critics also pointed out that the draft penal code halves the sentence of those convicted of corruption or those \u201cunlawfully enriching themselves\u201d from four to two years.",

      "bodyText": "The Daily Mail found a child at the climate strike who said they just wanted the day off school and Alan Jones quoted Joseph Goebbels. Those were just some of the more bizarre takes on the climate strike from sections of the media on Friday. Hundreds of thousands of people rallied across Australia in what were overwhelmingly peaceful events but on Sydney\u2019s most popular breakfast program Jones interviewed climate sceptics and claimed school children were being brainwashed by adults with a political agenda. \u201cThis sort of stuff is frightening young people,\u201d Jones told his audience. \u201cYoung people are going to be concerned, they believe their teachers, they actually think that they\u2019re at school and what they\u2019re being told is true. \u201cThe notion of using children in all of this is scandalous and the politics of climate change has become poisonous.\u201d When an elderly caller suggested the children\u2019s minds were being manipulated just like those of the Hitler Youth in Germany decades ago, Jones was in furious agreement. \u201cI will remind our listeners that [Hitler\u2019s] minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, also said it would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and the psychological understanding of the people concerned that a square is in fact a circle. \u201cThey are mere words and words can be moulded until they clothe ideas in disguise. This is what\u2019s going on here isn\u2019t it? Immensely disturbing I have to say. Immensely disturbing.\u201d Jones interviewed climate denier Christopher Monckton, who claimed the science was falling apart. \u201cThere\u2019s a very large political element in this climate storyline but the science is collapsing in all directions,\u201d he said. Nine\u2019s Melbourne bureau had a questionable angle on the strikes, which provoked some serious mocking after the reporter tweeted the angle as \u201cbreaking\u201d news. The Daily Mail has to be congratulated for allegedly finding children at the rally who said they did not care about climate change and they just wanted to go to Subway. The headline was dramatic: \u201cSchool children admit that they don\u2019t CARE about climate change and just want the day off \u2013 as violence erupts during mass protests\u201d. \u201cAs the sea of people made their way to the event at midday on Friday, some school students on scooters could be seen heading in the opposite direction \u2013 appearing disinterested in the event,\u201d the reporter said. But if you drilled down the story there was a single quote, from an unidentified child: \u201cI just wanted the day off school.\u201d A Sky News reporter covering the climate strike in Sydney said she was insulted by a protester after revealing who she worked for. While the Daily Telegraph\u2019s news coverage on the website was straight, the editor, Ben English, made his position clear in an email to readers, saying the paper had \u201cconsistently condemned so-called climate strikes as wastes of valuable school time\u201d. \u201cTo make up for lost classroom hours, perhaps those schools could set weekend assignments on the subjects of climate, coal and responsible governance,\u201d English said. \u201cAll of those themes were addressed in many protest signs, so the children will obviously have a handy head start on their research. \u201cStudents could be invited to answer some of the most complicated questions involving these topics. Questions such as: Where is the proposed Adani mine? (Hint: not the Barrier Reef.)\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Link\u2019s Awakening has always been a curio in the grand history of the Zelda franchise. The first Zelda game for a portable console, it was missing a number of series mainstays \u2013 no triforce, no ganon \u2026 heck, no Zelda \u2013 and took glee in replacing them with bizarre twists, like the plethora of cameos from other Nintendo games or the ability to steal items from a shopkeeper (incurring the penalty of having your saved game renamed THIEF).</p> <p>So it\u2019s delightful to see the game getting a remake after being repeatedly overlooked for re-releases in favour of its more conventional cousins such as Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time. And it is the sort of remake that sets the standard for what we should expect: every single thing fans love about the original game is here, except rather than a four-colour GameBoy screen, it\u2019s beautifully rendered in 3D with another 25 years of Easter eggs added for those dedicated enough to find them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d4fc8d898b73a5ba2b02ab1d230e729a29e507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d4fc8d898b73a5ba2b02ab1d230e729a29e507/132_0_2341_1406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Link\u2019s Awakening sees Link washed up on shore of the mysterious Koholint Island and tasked with gathering eight magical musical instruments to awaken the Wind Fish and return home. It\u2019s the 2D Zelda formula at its purest: enter dungeon, find item that unlocks path to next dungeon, rinse, repeat. There\u2019s no Link to the Past-style twist here: simply fitting the game as it is on an old GameBoy cartridge was feat enough.</p> <p>That means the game, in particular the overworld, is a masterpiece of efficient design, packing as many secrets as possible into any given screen. Which is good, because you\u2019ll be back-tracking a lot, even once you unlock the fast-travel system a few hours in; it\u2019s nice to notice, as you trek a path for the fifth time, that now you can pick up that boulder and see what\u2019s underneath it.</p> <p>There are a few more fast-travel points than in the first game \u2013 and more secret seashells to collect, and more heart pieces, and a whole figurine-collecting subgame that is completely ignorable \u2013 but by and large, this really is the same game. If, like me, you played Links Awakening until the cartridge broke, you\u2019ll probably be able to navigate on hazy memories alone.</p> <p>But the problem with being such a faithful recreation of a 26-year-old game is, well, it\u2019s still a 26-year-old game. And occasionally it shows. For instance, sometimes the doors will lock in a dungeon and you need to defeat all the enemies to get them to unlock. That\u2019s fine, until you hit some bosses who need bombs to defeat. Bombs you may not have, and which you can\u2019t get in the now-locked room. Time for either a deliberate death or a hard reset!</p> <p>Some enemies can only be hurt with your spin attack. There is no way of telling which ones these are, short of remembering to try your spin attack in the middle of hectic boss fights \u2013 at the same time as trying the magic dust, and the bombs, and boomerang and arrows and fire rod and everything else \u2013 because this era of Zelda really likes you using the right weapon on the right thing.</p> <p>Some frustrations have been softened. The extra buttons on the Switch mean that now your sword, shield, power bracelet and Pegasus boots are always equipped once you have them, limiting the endless item-swapping of the GameBoy version (although reducing some previously complex fights to triviality).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZROB4TnYH_I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZROB4TnYH_I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Other new introductions have fared less well. Worst is Damp\u00e9, a new character who lets you piece together new dungeons from rooms you\u2019ve previously encountered. Supposedly a mini Zelda Maker, a prototypical twin to Super Mario Maker, it ends up as a horrible grindy mess. You know the solutions to all the puzzles and can\u2019t do anything more interesting, so end up simply finding the minimal new creation required to fulfil each of Damp\u00e9\u2019s challenges, then ambling through the same 10 rooms you use each time, to get a few extra quarter hearts and secret seashells.</p> <p>Link\u2019s Awakening is a fantastic remake of a game that was fantastic in 1993. Fans must decide for themselves if those two things combine to make it a fantastic game in 2019 \u2013 particularly when the glorious Cadence of Hyrule is also on the Switch to scratch the itch you may have for 2D Zelda \u2013 and at a third of the price.</p>",

Which is good, because you\u2019ll be back-tracking a lot, even once you unlock the fast-travel system a few hours in; it\u2019s nice to notice, as you trek a path for the fifth time, that now you can pick up that boulder and see what\u2019s underneath it. There are a few more fast-travel points than in the first game \u2013 and more secret seashells to collect, and more heart pieces, and a whole figurine-collecting subgame that is completely ignorable \u2013 but by and large, this really is the same game. If, like me, you played Links Awakening until the cartridge broke, you\u2019ll probably be able to navigate on hazy memories alone. But the problem with being such a faithful recreation of a 26-year-old game is, well, it\u2019s still a 26-year-old game. And occasionally it shows. For instance, sometimes the doors will lock in a dungeon and you need to defeat all the enemies to get them to unlock. That\u2019s fine, until you hit some bosses who need bombs to defeat. Bombs you may not have, and which you can\u2019t get in the now-locked room. Time for either a deliberate death or a hard reset! Some enemies can only be hurt with your spin attack. There is no way of telling which ones these are, short of remembering to try your spin attack in the middle of hectic boss fights \u2013 at the same time as trying the magic dust, and the bombs, and boomerang and arrows and fire rod and everything else \u2013 because this era of Zelda really likes you using the right weapon on the right thing. Some frustrations have been softened. The extra buttons on the Switch mean that now your sword, shield, power bracelet and Pegasus boots are always equipped once you have them, limiting the endless item-swapping of the GameBoy version (although reducing some previously complex fights to triviality). Other new introductions have fared less well. Worst is Damp\u00e9, a new character who lets you piece together new dungeons from rooms you\u2019ve previously encountered. Supposedly a mini Zelda Maker, a prototypical twin to Super Mario Maker, it ends up as a horrible grindy mess. You know the solutions to all the puzzles and can\u2019t do anything more interesting, so end up simply finding the minimal new creation required to fulfil each of Damp\u00e9\u2019s challenges, then ambling through the same 10 rooms you use each time, to get a few extra quarter hearts and secret seashells. Link\u2019s Awakening is a fantastic remake of a game that was fantastic in 1993. Fans must decide for themselves if those two things combine to make it a fantastic game in 2019 \u2013 particularly when the glorious Cadence of Hyrule is also on the Switch to scratch the itch you may have for 2D Zelda \u2013 and at a third of the price.",

      "body": "<h2><br>Joe Hart, Burnley</h2> <p>Seventy-five England caps are not to be sniffed at but the former Manchester City goalkeeper\u2019s fall has been pretty extraordinary. It is three years since Iceland humiliated England at Euro 2016 and Hart, having failed to repair his reputation at Torino or West Ham, has not started a Premier League game since Boxing Day, a 5-1 home defeat by Everton, which compounded a miserable defensive record: he kept three clean sheets and conceded 41 goals in 19 top-flight matches last season. Not even the departure of Tom Heaton has soothed things for Hart, 32, with Nick Pope restored as Sean Dyche\u2019s No 1 and the arrival of Bailey Peacock-Farrell meaning he is not guaranteed to be second-choice. His sole appearance this season came in a cup defeat by Sunderland, and it proved nightmarish: Sunderland scored from three of their four shots on target and Hart\u2019s only save led to a goal.</p> <h2><strong>Cuco Martina, Everton</strong></h2> <p>The Cura\u00e7ao defender, ordered to train away from the first team by Marco Silva more than a year ago, has not featured for Everton since defeat at Burnley in March 2018. Ronald Koeman, who signed him for Everton and earlier for Southampton, heralded Martina\u2019s versatility but that trait appears to have hindered the 29-year-old, who was relegated to the Under-23s this season. The full-back, a free transfer two years ago, is out of contract next summer. Spent last season on loan at Stoke and then Feyenoord.</p> <h2><strong>Winston Reid, West Ham United</strong></h2> <p>But for Mark Noble, the New Zealand defender would be the longest-serving player at the club. The scorer of the last goal at Upton Park, Reid is something of a cult hero but West Ham supporters have not seen him in first-team action since March 2018 owing to injury. Reid returned in pre-season after twice undergoing knee surgery but continues to build his fitness behind the scenes. The club are reluctant to rush Reid, who signed a new six-and-a-half year contract to stave off interest in 2015, given his injury history and in the meantime they can call on Angelo Ogbonna, Issa Diop and Fabian Balbuena.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d281ae90060876c2de16071001f4c7e01960b4a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d281ae90060876c2de16071001f4c7e01960b4a9/0_0_4170_2866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winston Reid in action for West Ham in a pre-season friendly.

The 27-year-old was at the centre of calamitous defensive displays last season \u2013 gifting Crystal Palace three goals springs to mind \u2013 and was booed by supporters throughout pre-season. Mustafi has two years on the contract he signed on arrival from Valencia for \u00a335m in 2016, when the World Cup winner was trumpeted as a solution to Arsenal\u2019s meek surrender.</p> <h2><strong>Marcos Rojo, Manchester United</strong></h2> <p>Not so long ago Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said the Argentinian was playing the best football of his career. Now, he\u2019s making up the numbers, with the 29-year-old, signed by Louis van Gaal, sticking around this summer to provide cover for the injured Luke Shaw. Rojo got his first United appearance of the season in a much-changed Europa League side on Thursday. Everton held an interest in Rojo over the summer but injury put paid to the defender\u2019s hopes of following Chris Smalling out of the door, despite Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r acknowledging he is overstocked at centre-half. Rojo has made 63 league starts since arriving from Sporting Lisbon five years ago but only seven in the past 18 months and was left out of Argentina\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica squad.</p> <h2><strong>Victor Wanyama, Tottenham Hotspur</strong></h2> <p>No player has felt the force of Tanguy Ndombele\u2019s club-record \u00a353.8m move more than the Kenya midfielder. Wanyama has been sidelined after playing a bit-part role last season, during which he made four top-flight starts. No longer a key cog \u2013 he missed two Premier League games as Tottenham finished runners-up to Chelsea two years ago \u2013he was given the green light to join Club Brugge in a \u00a310m deal this summer but failed to agree personal terms. When Ndombele was ruled out against Arsenal this month he failed to make the bench with Harry Winks and the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp among those ahead of him in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s thinking.</p> <h2><strong>Jairo Riedewald, Crystal Palace</strong></h2> <p>League Two Colchester are the only first-team opposition the Dutchman has faced this season, with the midfielder, who was playing in the Europa League final for Ajax two years ago, otherwise having to make do with run-outs for the Under-23s. Riedewald\u2019s career was given lift-off by Frank de Boer as a teenager but upon being reunited at Selhurst Park things did not go to plan for either party. De Boer was sacked after 77 days and Riedewald has filled in at centre-back and left-back and not started a Premier League game since February 2018. Ray Lewington, the Palace assistant manager, has acknowledged Riedewald faces something of an impossible job to dislodge captain Luka Milivojevic from the starting lineup, and James McArthur, James McCarthy and Chiekhou Kouyate are also preferred midfield options.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc4e7440a5d38f7b1386d7bdbe9edad653c91730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc4e7440a5d38f7b1386d7bdbe9edad653c91730/486_278_3960_2809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jairo Riedewald controls the ball against Colchester in the Carabao Cup, his one first-team game this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jairo Riedewald controls the ball against Colchester in the Carabao Cup, his one first-team game this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Marco van Ginkel, Chelsea</strong></h2> <p>To put the midfielder\u2019s Chelsea career into some perspective, his last appearance came at Swindon, six years ago, when the manager was Mourinho, Fernando Torres was up front and Samuel Eto\u2019o on the bench. Oh, and Mark Schwarzer was in goal. The 26-year-old was an \u00a38m signing from Vitesse Arnhem but has spent precious little time at Stamford Bridge. Van Ginkel, who has made four first-team Chelsea appearances, was loaned to Milan in 2014-15, Stoke the following season and then PSV Eindhoven, where he impressed, scoring 14 goals in 28 games in 2017-18 before sustaining a serious knee injury. Van Ginkel is continuing his rehabilitation and building fitness following surgery last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Oumar Niasse, Everton</strong></h2> <p>A \u00a313.5m signing from Lokomotiv Moscow three years ago, the striker is in the final 12 months of his contract and the only surprise is that he has lasted this long. Things turned acrimonious six months after he signed.

Niasse featured this pre-season before being phased out and last started a league game in May 2018. A fruitless loan at Cardiff did little to resuscitate his career and the arrival of Moise Kean has pushed him further away from Everton\u2019s first team.</p> <h2><strong>Henri Saivet, Newcastle United</strong></h2> <p>From Demba Ba and Georginio Wijnaldum to Gabriel Obertan and Emmanuel Rivi\u00e8re, the former chief scout Graham Carr had a mixed record at Newcastle. Saivet, 28, is another arrival with Carr\u2019s fingerprints but the former Bordeaux midfielder has proved a lesser-spotted figure since joining three years ago, having spent the majority of time on loan at Saint-\u00c9tienne, Sivasspor and Bursaspor. Saivet\u2019s last Newcastle outing came at West Ham two years ago, when he scored his only goal for the club, but he remains a influential figure for Senegal, playing five of their six matches, including the final, at the Africa Cup of Nations this summer.</p>",

This was followed by weekly lunchtime sex (at my apartment in London). Soon afterwards, my partner and I decided to live together, and her lover began to visit our place once or twice a week. The challenge, for me, was to recognise that the chemistry she had with him was no threat to her love for me. I could not ask her to forgo such enjoyment (he is 20 years younger than me, 15 years younger than her, so there is a huge difference in the pleasure she gets from each of us). I recognised that the problem was mine, not hers. We interact comfortably and they feel unselfconscious about showing their mutual attraction in my presence. I enjoy seeing their foreplay or hearing them having noisy sex in the spare room \u2013 not as a matter of eroticism, simply two people having a good time. She would not want me to have the same, and so I remain happily monogamous. Through honesty, openness and trust, we have found the formula for a perfect model relationship. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?

Texas Ranger Darren Matthews, who was introduced in 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/21/bluebird-bluebird-by-attica-locke-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bluebird, Bluebird</em></a>, is in many ways a classic noir protagonist. His own mother is blackmailing him; he\u2019s in constant danger of \u201cfalling off the cliff of his own morality\u201d; his marriage and sobriety are teetering on the same edge. But in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/15/attica-locke-when-trump-was-elected-overnight-my-book-changed\" title=\"\">Locke\u2019s brand of noir</a>, Matthews also happens to be a black cop for whom black lives matter, grappling with the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election and marvelling daily \u201cwith befuddled anger at what a handful of scared white people could do to a nation\u201d. In a subplot carried over from <em>Bluebird, Bluebird</em>, he has landed himself in hot water after covering for an elderly black man suspected of murdering a racist petty criminal in the course of running him off his land because \u201chis own read of history told him a black man should have the right to his own fear. Otherwise, he would forever be dying because of someone else\u2019s.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"56e1b17baafc8bfd072c3bd1e1f7c71647131648\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56e1b17baafc8bfd072c3bd1e1f7c71647131648/1447_1380_2026_2437/831.jpg\" alt=\"Attica Locke.\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attica Locke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Tuffs/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Levi King, the nine-year-old son of an Aryan Brotherhood captain, vanishes on Caddo Lake in east Texas, the investigation brings Matthews to an enclave in Marion County named Hopetown, settled in the 19th century by a group of slaves who swam to freedom and still occupied by their descendants more than a century later: \u201cpart of a larger historical story of what black freedom looks like\u201d. A band of squatters linked to the Brotherhood and led by Levi\u2019s stepfather, Gil Adamson, have set up a ramshackle trailer park on its borders, and clashes between the rightful residents and these neo-Nazi interlopers with whom they are forced to live cheek by jowl have resulted in an uneasy standoff.</p> <p>A seam of southern gothic runs through the novel: the swampy moss-wreathed lake that seems to have swallowed a boy whole, his mother\u2019s febrile grief, the fading antebellum glory of the hotel where Matthews is put up by the local police force, allegedly haunted by a slave mistress who died by her own hands. But it\u2019s men such as Adamson who are the real nightmare. When Matthews arrives at his home he refuses to allow him inside, unable to see past the black man to his badge: \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit \u2019bout the star on his chest.\u201d He\u2019s the kind of person whose toxic nostalgia has led him to flank his front door with racist figurines waving Confederate flags, and of whom Locke writes: \u201cThe country seemed to grow them in secret like a nasty fungal disease that spread in the dark places you don\u2019t ever dare look.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The plot thickens when it\u2019s revealed that the last person to see Levi was a cantankerous black man named Leroy Page</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The action shifts between Hopetown and nearby Jefferson, where we encounter the quietly slapping water of the bayou as well as a thick, insidious bog of racism, and where the missing boy\u2019s wealthy grandmother presides over the town behind a facade of gentility. Citing examples of black people she has welcomed into her home, she can get no further than her maid and her driver. The requisite plot thickener is supplied when it\u2019s revealed that the last person to see Levi was a cantankerous black man named Leroy Page, Hopetown\u2019s oldest resident, who periodically rustles up gun-toting horseback patrols as a kind of vigilante response to the encroaching threats. When the investigation inevitably narrows in on Page, the needle on Matthews\u2019s wavering moral compass swings even more wildly, as he reckons with his own \u201cblind spots when it came to black folks\u201d, and his instinct to give Page the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p><em>Heaven, My Home</em> is a propulsive and compelling novel, worthy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/11/walter-mosley-donald-trump-lazy-spoilt-guy\" title=\"\">comparisons to Walter Mosley</a>. The story whips along towards a resolution so neat and tidy that it skates very close to cliche, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/03/attica-locke-esi-edugyan-interview\" title=\"\">Locke\u2019s exploration</a> of Matthews\u2019s predicament digs deep into the tension between \u201cthe impulse to police crimes against black life and to protect black life from police\u201d. It is buttressed by passages of gorgeous lyricism, with loving, elegiac evocations of Texas set alongside extended meditations on displacement, reconciliation and forgiveness, and on what \u201chome\u201d means in a place where it\u2019s an idea you can\u2019t \u201cexactly touch\u201d. In some scenes there\u2019s an old African American spiritual playing in the background, an anthem of resistance from which the novel takes its name: \u201cI make heaven my home, I shall not be moved.\u201d Locke suggests that being black in America has meant a constant, disorienting search for terra firma, fighting to claim some piece of the \u201cfields and prairies that we once tilled until our backs broke and bled\u201d, and that this feeling has returned with terrible urgency, or perhaps that it never left.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/04/the-confessions-of-frannie-langton-by-sara-collins-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sara Collins\u2019s The Confessions of Frannie Langton</em></a><em> is published by </em><em>Penguin</em><em>.Heaven, My Home is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a314.99). </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/heaven-my-home-9781781257692.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.</em></a><em> Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315, online orders only.

      "bodyText": "Heaven, My Home is the second instalment in Attica Locke\u2019s Highway 59 series, hard-boiled crime novels in which the crime doubles as the mechanism by which the state of race relations in the US is laid bare. Texas Ranger Darren Matthews, who was introduced in 2018\u2019s Bluebird, Bluebird, is in many ways a classic noir protagonist. His own mother is blackmailing him; he\u2019s in constant danger of \u201cfalling off the cliff of his own morality\u201d; his marriage and sobriety are teetering on the same edge. But in Locke\u2019s brand of noir, Matthews also happens to be a black cop for whom black lives matter, grappling with the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election and marvelling daily \u201cwith befuddled anger at what a handful of scared white people could do to a nation\u201d. In a subplot carried over from Bluebird, Bluebird, he has landed himself in hot water after covering for an elderly black man suspected of murdering a racist petty criminal in the course of running him off his land because \u201chis own read of history told him a black man should have the right to his own fear. Otherwise, he would forever be dying because of someone else\u2019s.\u201d When Levi King, the nine-year-old son of an Aryan Brotherhood captain, vanishes on Caddo Lake in east Texas, the investigation brings Matthews to an enclave in Marion County named Hopetown, settled in the 19th century by a group of slaves who swam to freedom and still occupied by their descendants more than a century later: \u201cpart of a larger historical story of what black freedom looks like\u201d. A band of squatters linked to the Brotherhood and led by Levi\u2019s stepfather, Gil Adamson, have set up a ramshackle trailer park on its borders, and clashes between the rightful residents and these neo-Nazi interlopers with whom they are forced to live cheek by jowl have resulted in an uneasy standoff. A seam of southern gothic runs through the novel: the swampy moss-wreathed lake that seems to have swallowed a boy whole, his mother\u2019s febrile grief, the fading antebellum glory of the hotel where Matthews is put up by the local police force, allegedly haunted by a slave mistress who died by her own hands. But it\u2019s men such as Adamson who are the real nightmare. When Matthews arrives at his home he refuses to allow him inside, unable to see past the black man to his badge: \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit \u2019bout the star on his chest.\u201d He\u2019s the kind of person whose toxic nostalgia has led him to flank his front door with racist figurines waving Confederate flags, and of whom Locke writes: \u201cThe country seemed to grow them in secret like a nasty fungal disease that spread in the dark places you don\u2019t ever dare look.\u201d The action shifts between Hopetown and nearby Jefferson, where we encounter the quietly slapping water of the bayou as well as a thick, insidious bog of racism, and where the missing boy\u2019s wealthy grandmother presides over the town behind a facade of gentility. Citing examples of black people she has welcomed into her home, she can get no further than her maid and her driver. The requisite plot thickener is supplied when it\u2019s revealed that the last person to see Levi was a cantankerous black man named Leroy Page, Hopetown\u2019s oldest resident, who periodically rustles up gun-toting horseback patrols as a kind of vigilante response to the encroaching threats. When the investigation inevitably narrows in on Page, the needle on Matthews\u2019s wavering moral compass swings even more wildly, as he reckons with his own \u201cblind spots when it came to black folks\u201d, and his instinct to give Page the benefit of the doubt. Heaven, My Home is a propulsive and compelling novel, worthy of comparisons to Walter Mosley. The story whips along towards a resolution so neat and tidy that it skates very close to cliche, but Locke\u2019s exploration of Matthews\u2019s predicament digs deep into the tension between \u201cthe impulse to police crimes against black life and to protect black life from police\u201d. It is buttressed by passages of gorgeous lyricism, with loving, elegiac evocations of Texas set alongside extended meditations on displacement, reconciliation and forgiveness, and on what \u201chome\u201d means in a place where it\u2019s an idea you can\u2019t \u201cexactly touch\u201d. In some scenes there\u2019s an old African American spiritual playing in the background, an anthem of resistance from which the novel takes its name: \u201cI make heaven my home, I shall not be moved.\u201d Locke suggests that being black in America has meant a constant, disorienting search for terra firma, fighting to claim some piece of the \u201cfields and prairies that we once tilled until our backs broke and bled\u201d, and that this feeling has returned with terrible urgency, or perhaps that it never left. \u2022 Sara Collins\u2019s The Confessions of Frannie Langton is published by Penguin.Heaven, My Home is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>Kaillie Humphries brought glory to Canada time and again on the world stage, winning a gold medal in the two-woman bobsleigh at the Vancouver Olympics and becoming the first woman ever to successfully defend her title in Sochi four years later. She has challenged gender norms in sport by being one of the first few women to compete in mixed gender racing, then in 2016 drove an all-woman team against men in international competition.</p> <p>Technically speaking, Humphries is badass, and Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton has adored her. The true north has only started to utter it\u2019s polite disdain since last week when Humphries announced that she wanted to leave the national federation because she had endured verbal and mental abuse from head coach Todd Hays. Humphries declared her intention to switch federations and compete under the American flag moving forward. \u201cI need to be the best athlete I can be and go where it\u2019s safe and where I have an opportunity to continue my career\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/bobsleigh/kaillie-humphries-bobsleigh-canada-harassment-todd-hays-1.5283064\">said in an interview</a> with CBC Sports. \u201cAnd unfortunately, that is not with Bobsleigh Canada anymore.\u201d</p> <p>There are those who have taken her disclosure of abuse as a personal insult to this country, and that is extremely dangerous. It is important to not conflate patriotism with the needs of an athlete. This is not about how loyal of a Canadian Humphries is. This is about her wellness as a person. Did we forget that she\u2019s human?</p> <p>Now I am the first person to enjoy a friendly rivalry with my neighbors to the south. There is no one that cheers louder for the Canadian women\u2019s hockey team than I \u2013 particularly against the United States. But in an instance where an athlete is in danger of emotional trauma, any loyalty I have to Canada is quickly put aside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/17/safesport-rise-sex-abuse-misconduct-claims\">Sexual abuse and misconduct claims in US Olympic sports rise by 55% in 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bobsleigh Canada has not been an advocate or supportive of Humphries, despite what\u2019s by all appearances been a mutually beneficial relationship. According to the national governing body an investigation remains \u201congoing\u201d. I have worked in sports journalism for a long time and know that such \u201cinvestigations\u201d are contaminated by bureaucracy and the politics of power. It is important to note that two American athletes had previously reported to SafeSport, an independent entity that investigates alleged abuse in sports, that Hays physically, verbally and mentally abused them while he was a coach with the USA program.</p> <p>Needless to say, the Humphries situation has created a lot of frigidity in an already frosty area.</p> <p>But if an athlete loses faith in the very organization that is supposed to advocate for them, and at the very place where their alleged abuser thrives, how can they focus on training and optimizing themselves for the physical and mental rigors of elite competition? It is mind-blowingly unjust.</p> <p>Humphries decided to sue the national governing body to force her release, but a judge in Alberta <a href=\"https://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/teammates-welcome-back-kaillie-humphries-shes-team-player/\">denied her request</a>, citing insufficient proof of abuse. The tragic irony is that emotional and verbal abuse is notoriously difficult to prove. Once again we see that a legal system does nothing to help survivors. In response to the ruling, Humphries has declared that she <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/5920200/olympic-athlete-kaillie-humphries-bobsleigh-canada-skeleton/\">will not compete</a> for Canada if the organization continues under the current management.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear about this: athletes do not owe Canada anything. It is an honor for <em>us</em> to showcase <em>them</em>, and although they often talk about the happiness of competing internationally with a maple leaf on their chests, the reality is that we give them very little in return other than a tear-jerking commercial from Procter &amp; Gamble or a carefully crafted montage during a mega-event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2ef6dc36d848097e4b33790f9307ecda16b0bbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2ef6dc36d848097e4b33790f9307ecda16b0bbe/0_124_4716_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaillie Humphries, left, and Heather Moyse successfully defended their gold medals in the two-woman bobsleigh at the Sochi Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women athletes are typically under-funded and lack financial support for training. Many work full-time jobs or live with family to minimize costs.</p> <p>While programs like <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/sports/canadas-olympic-growth-puts-strain-on-own-the-podium-funding/\">Own the Podium</a> have helped athletes more, it puts added pressure on for medal production and winning. Canada boasts some of the most talented women\u2019s hockey players in the world but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep a professional league afloat in this country. A damn shame. We do not give our women athletes enough support by any metric.</p> <p>So the least we can do is safeguard their well-being. The Canadian rowing legend and my personal shero, <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/silken-laumann-empowers-canadians-to-walk-the-talk-when-it-comes-to-mental-health-with-project-unsinkable-855286009.html\">Silken Laumann</a>, has been very public with her struggles with mental health and surviving emotional turmoil. (Full disclosure: I have written for Laumann\u2019s project and shared <a href=\"https://weareunsinkable.com/lady-army/\">my own struggles</a> with my mental health.) The toll on athletes is grave and can feel unsurmountable.

      "bodyText": "Kaillie Humphries brought glory to Canada time and again on the world stage, winning a gold medal in the two-woman bobsleigh at the Vancouver Olympics and becoming the first woman ever to successfully defend her title in Sochi four years later. She has challenged gender norms in sport by being one of the first few women to compete in mixed gender racing, then in 2016 drove an all-woman team against men in international competition. Technically speaking, Humphries is badass, and Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton has adored her. The true north has only started to utter it\u2019s polite disdain since last week when Humphries announced that she wanted to leave the national federation because she had endured verbal and mental abuse from head coach Todd Hays. Humphries declared her intention to switch federations and compete under the American flag moving forward. \u201cI need to be the best athlete I can be and go where it\u2019s safe and where I have an opportunity to continue my career\u201d she said in an interview with CBC Sports. \u201cAnd unfortunately, that is not with Bobsleigh Canada anymore.\u201d There are those who have taken her disclosure of abuse as a personal insult to this country, and that is extremely dangerous. It is important to not conflate patriotism with the needs of an athlete. This is not about how loyal of a Canadian Humphries is. This is about her wellness as a person. Did we forget that she\u2019s human? Now I am the first person to enjoy a friendly rivalry with my neighbors to the south. There is no one that cheers louder for the Canadian women\u2019s hockey team than I \u2013 particularly against the United States. But in an instance where an athlete is in danger of emotional trauma, any loyalty I have to Canada is quickly put aside. Bobsleigh Canada has not been an advocate or supportive of Humphries, despite what\u2019s by all appearances been a mutually beneficial relationship. According to the national governing body an investigation remains \u201congoing\u201d. I have worked in sports journalism for a long time and know that such \u201cinvestigations\u201d are contaminated by bureaucracy and the politics of power. It is important to note that two American athletes had previously reported to SafeSport, an independent entity that investigates alleged abuse in sports, that Hays physically, verbally and mentally abused them while he was a coach with the USA program. Needless to say, the Humphries situation has created a lot of frigidity in an already frosty area. But if an athlete loses faith in the very organization that is supposed to advocate for them, and at the very place where their alleged abuser thrives, how can they focus on training and optimizing themselves for the physical and mental rigors of elite competition? It is mind-blowingly unjust. Humphries decided to sue the national governing body to force her release, but a judge in Alberta denied her request, citing insufficient proof of abuse. The tragic irony is that emotional and verbal abuse is notoriously difficult to prove. Once again we see that a legal system does nothing to help survivors. In response to the ruling, Humphries has declared that she will not compete for Canada if the organization continues under the current management. Let\u2019s be clear about this: athletes do not owe Canada anything. It is an honor for us to showcase them, and although they often talk about the happiness of competing internationally with a maple leaf on their chests, the reality is that we give them very little in return other than a tear-jerking commercial from Procter &amp; Gamble or a carefully crafted montage during a mega-event. Women athletes are typically under-funded and lack financial support for training. Many work full-time jobs or live with family to minimize costs. While programs like Own the Podium have helped athletes more, it puts added pressure on for medal production and winning. Canada boasts some of the most talented women\u2019s hockey players in the world but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep a professional league afloat in this country. A damn shame. We do not give our women athletes enough support by any metric. So the least we can do is safeguard their well-being. The Canadian rowing legend and my personal shero, Silken Laumann, has been very public with her struggles with mental health and surviving emotional turmoil. (Full disclosure: I have written for Laumann\u2019s project and shared my own struggles with my mental health.) The toll on athletes is grave and can feel unsurmountable. Having to fight against your national governing body cannot be good for a dedicated and passionate athlete. The effects of a coach abusing an athlete is all too often disregarded in sports, only more so when the dynamic involves an abusive male coach and a woman athlete. Athletes are expected to be strong and endure the training with a \u201ctough mentality\u201d. Without proper support, that athlete is reduced to a high-performance machine whose feelings and emotional needs are put aside. Humphries needs support. I was elated when I saw her and her bobsleigh partner Heather Moyse bear the Canadian flag in the closing ceremony at the Sochi Olympics after they won a second consecutive gold medal. But that pride and ownership over Humphries is unrealistic and unjust. She needs to heal and she needs to grow as an athlete. She cannot do this in Canada under the current circumstances. Is her only option to quit? By denying Humphries a chance to grow and heal, or even mediate the situation, Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton has proven that what they really care about: power and control. And I will most certainly not raise a glass of maple syrup to that.",

Now, thanks to the soul-infused R&amp;B of 2018\u2019s First Signs of Me EP, a show-stopping debut on Later ... (while still unsigned) and her recent London anthem, London, she is being touted as one to watch in 2020.<br><em><a href=\"https://scala.co.uk/events/hamzaa/\">The Scala, N1, Thursday 26 September</a></em></p> <h2>Madeon</h2> <p>When Hugo Pierre Leclercq, AKA Madeon, was 17 he chucked a mash-up of 39 different songs online and thought nothing more of it. The song, christened Pop Culture, went viral, he was signed to Columbia and went on to produce songs for Lady Gaga. Eight years later, after some time away, he is back with more densely packed dance music, with a new album, Good Faith, due soon.<br><em><a href=\"https://heaven-live.co.uk/event/madeon/\">Heaven, WC2, Wednesday 25 September</a></em></p> <h2>Hannah Diamond</h2> <p>With PC Music acolyte and Photoshop fan Hannah Diamond\u2019s delayed debut album, Reflections, apparently still due for release at some point this year, expect a handful of new songs to creep into this one-off show\u2019s setlist. Perhaps the album has been delayed by Diamond\u2019s recent focus on photography, shooting the likes of Offset, Olly Alexander and occasional collaborator Charli XCX.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.seetickets.com/event/hannah-diamond/soup-kitchen/1422721\">Soup Kitchen, Manchester, Saturday 21 September</a></em></p> <h2>Joe, Dru Hill, 112</h2> <p>This trip down R&amp;B memory lane was originally meant to feature Brandy but, according the Eventim Apollo\u2019s website, \u201cdue to no reason given\u201d she\u2019ll no longer be joining Sisq\u00f3 et al. Still, in her place there\u2019s Bad Boy Records\u2019 \u201cvocal harmony group\u201d 112 alongside the smooth croon of Joe and a whole host of Dru Hill bangers and slow jams to make it feel like 1996 all over again.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.seetickets.com/tour/joe-112-and-dru-hill\">Eventim Apollo, W6, Fri; touring to Sunday 29 September</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Vijay Iyer</h2> <p>London\u2019s venerable Wigmore Hall could hardly have found a better composer in residence to reflect contemporary music\u2019s diversity than Vijay Iyer, the US jazz and straight composer, piano improviser, and world-musical genre-hopper. These two gigs find Iyer exploring long-running partnerships with acclaimed New York pianist Craig Taborn, and poet and electronicist Mike Ladd.<br><em><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/artistic-series/vijay-iyer-residency-musicality\">Wigmore Hall, W1, Sunday 22 September</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fd0ab7ba75969ff15c0d78fb9b3c24d49a27526\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fd0ab7ba75969ff15c0d78fb9b3c24d49a27526/0_211_2049_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerald Barry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Booked up\u2026 Gerald Barry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Betson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Intelligence Park</h2> <p>Gerald Barry has now composed six stage works but his operatic journey began in 1990 with The Intelligence Park. A tale of love between an opera composer and a castrato set in Dublin in 1753, it is a freewheeling mix of styles and historical references, with much of the music based upon chorales by Bach. Music Theatre Wales\u2019s revival is directed and designed by Nigel Lowery, whose quirky vision might well match Barry\u2019s anarchic imagination, and stars Michel de Souza and Patrick Terry.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-intelligence-park-by-music-theatre-wales\">Royal Opera House: Linbury Theatre, WC2 Wednesday 25 September to Friday 4 October; touring to Monday 4 November</a></em></p> <h2>Bittersweet Metropolis</h2> <p>Any series devoted to the music of the Weimar republic must explore the cabaret that flourished in Germany in the 1920s, and the second half of the Philharmonia\u2019s Weimar series begins with an evening devoted to the images, words and music that came out of that explosion of artistic energy. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts, as he does the more conventional final pair of concerts, featuring music by Hindemith, Berg, Weill and Busoni.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.philharmonia.co.uk/concerts/series/82/weimar_berlin_bittersweet_metropolis?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ad&amp;utm_content=velo-weimar_wave_2_season_19-20-80km_london-UK-competitor_interest-google_search-custom_affinity-image-image1_copy1&amp;utm_campaign=velo-weimar_wave_2_season_19-20-80km_london-UK-competitor_interest-google_search-custom_affinity&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgK78697c5AIVw9DeCh2PfwJXEAAYASAAEgJ2jPD_BwE\">Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Monday 23 September; Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Thursday 26 &amp; Sunday 29 September</a></em></p> <h2>Carmen</h2> <p>Welsh National Opera\u2019s first season under its new general director Aidan Lang opens with a new staging of one of the staples of any company\u2019s repertory. Jo Davies directs what is promised as an updating of Bizet\u2019s masterpiece, set in Central America in the 1970s. In the initial cast, Virginie Verrez takes the title role, with Dimitri Pittas as Don Jos\u00e9 and Phillip Rhodes as Escamillo.<br><em><a href=\"https://wno.org.uk/whats-on/carmen-bizet\">Wales Millennium Centre: Donald Gordon Theatre, Cardiff, Sat 21 September to Thursday 10 October; touring to Thursday 7 May</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a807ef4149b7c571c1b49a2f2042f07e921d2b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a807ef4149b7c571c1b49a2f2042f07e921d2b4/0_0_3278_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steel to Rust - Meltdown, 2016, Otobong Nkanga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steel to Rust - Meltdown, 2016, by Otobong Nkanga</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Otobong Nkanga</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Otobong Nkanga</h2> <p>Maps of the spaces between us and the hidden forces that connect us \u2013 desire and fear, money and power \u2013 give the work of this Nigeria-born, Belgium-based artist a cosmic mystery. She uses tapestry as well as painting and video to weave her lyrical images of the threads of human community and the world economy.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-st-ives/exhibition/otobong-nkanga\">Tate St Ives Saturday 21 September to Sunday 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>Antony Gormley</h2> <p>One of Britain\u2019s most popular artists brings his mixture of spectacle and simplicity to London in what is sure to be a hit show. In recent years, Gormley has branched out in all directions \u2013 from hotel design to mass participation \u2013 but the expressionless casts of the human figure that are his trademark remain his most convincing images.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/antony-gormley\">Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Saturday 21 September to Tuesday 3 December</a></em></p> <h2>Mark Leckey</h2> <p>A full-sized replica of a Merseyside motorway bridge that hung over the artist\u2019s childhood is the centrepiece of this journey through memory, myth and pop culture. A radio drama about kids, changelings and Leckey\u2019s own early years will haunt this grandiose and brutal setting. At his best this artist is a hallucinatory archaeologist of contemporary life. At his worst he\u2019s like a loud but vacant music festival where nothing adds up to much.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/mark-leckey\">Tate Britain, SW1, Tuesday 24 September to Sunday 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>The Art of Innovation</h2> <p>Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg\u2019s painting Coalbrookdale By Night is a masterpiece of Romantic art yet belongs to the Science Museum. Why? Because art and technology were as entwined in the Industrial Revolution as they are today. This blockbuster explores two centuries of art and science and also includes futurist sculptures, installations inspired by contemporary physics, and what may be the art of AI.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/art-innovation-enlightenment-dark-matter\">Science Museum, SW7, Wednesday 25 September to Sunday 26 January</a></em></p> <h2>Anna Maria Maiolino</h2> <p>Bizarre organic effusions made of mud sprout from the imagination of this artist, born in Italy in the last years of Mussolini, who moved to Brazil when she was 18 only to live under a similarly brutal regime. Maiolino is a dissident artist whose subversion ranges from sensual sketches of fantastic worlds to films that defied the military. A masterclass in the art of resistance.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/anna-maria-maiolino/\">Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Wednesday 25 September to Sunday 12 January</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f2c701480b781a90438dfb787d40c51675d783d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f2c701480b781a90438dfb787d40c51675d783d/0_275_5802_3481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hair today\u2026 Grace Molony and Paksie Vernon in The Watsons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hair today\u2026 Grace Molony and Paksie Vernon in The Watsons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Watsons</h2> <p>Laura Wade\u2019s adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s unfinished novel was the big hit of last year\u2019s Chichester festival. It is, however, no scissors-and-paste job but, in Samuel West\u2019s production, a brilliantly witty examination of who actually owns a story: is it the author or the characters themselves?

Could it be that the play has suddenly acquired a dangerous topicality? Here, John Simm becomes the murderous thane with Dervla Kirwan as his dagger-wielding wife. Paul Miller, who is doing great things at Richmond\u2019s Orange Tree and who directed Simm\u2019s Hamlet in Sheffield, is in charge of proceedings.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/macbeth\">Chichester Festival Theatre, Saturday 21 September to Saturday 26 October</a></em></p> <h2>Assassins</h2> <p>Even by Stephen Sondheim\u2019s standards, this was a daring show: \u201can anti-musical about anti-heroes,\u201d as the New York Times put it, exploring nine actual, or would-be, presidential assassins. In fact, the show, with a book by John Weidman, says a lot about the American dream and evokes the rich sound of the nation\u2019s music. It is directed by Bill Buckhurst, who did a superb Sweet Charity at Nottingham Playhouse, where this production heads after.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.watermill.org.uk/assassins\">West Berkshire Playhouse: The Watermill, Newbury, Thursday 26 September to Saturday 26 October</a></em></p> <h2>The Wolf of Wall Street</h2> <p>Jordan Belfort\u2019s memoir about his life as a stock market millionaire and federal convict has already been turned into a Martin Scorsese movie.

(while still unsigned) and her recent London anthem, London, she is being touted as one to watch in 2020. The Scala, N1, Thursday 26 September Madeon When Hugo Pierre Leclercq, AKA Madeon, was 17 he chucked a mash-up of 39 different songs online and thought nothing more of it. The song, christened Pop Culture, went viral, he was signed to Columbia and went on to produce songs for Lady Gaga. Eight years later, after some time away, he is back with more densely packed dance music, with a new album, Good Faith, due soon. Heaven, WC2, Wednesday 25 September Hannah Diamond With PC Music acolyte and Photoshop fan Hannah Diamond\u2019s delayed debut album, Reflections, apparently still due for release at some point this year, expect a handful of new songs to creep into this one-off show\u2019s setlist. Perhaps the album has been delayed by Diamond\u2019s recent focus on photography, shooting the likes of Offset, Olly Alexander and occasional collaborator Charli XCX. Soup Kitchen, Manchester, Saturday 21 September Joe, Dru Hill, 112 This trip down R&amp;B memory lane was originally meant to feature Brandy but, according the Eventim Apollo\u2019s website, \u201cdue to no reason given\u201d she\u2019ll no longer be joining Sisq\u00f3 et al. Still, in her place there\u2019s Bad Boy Records\u2019 \u201cvocal harmony group\u201d 112 alongside the smooth croon of Joe and a whole host of Dru Hill bangers and slow jams to make it feel like 1996 all over again. Eventim Apollo, W6, Fri; touring to Sunday 29 September MC Vijay Iyer London\u2019s venerable Wigmore Hall could hardly have found a better composer in residence to reflect contemporary music\u2019s diversity than Vijay Iyer, the US jazz and straight composer, piano improviser, and world-musical genre-hopper. These two gigs find Iyer exploring long-running partnerships with acclaimed New York pianist Craig Taborn, and poet and electronicist Mike Ladd. Wigmore Hall, W1, Sunday 22 September JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts The Intelligence Park Gerald Barry has now composed six stage works but his operatic journey began in 1990 with The Intelligence Park. A tale of love between an opera composer and a castrato set in Dublin in 1753, it is a freewheeling mix of styles and historical references, with much of the music based upon chorales by Bach. Music Theatre Wales\u2019s revival is directed and designed by Nigel Lowery, whose quirky vision might well match Barry\u2019s anarchic imagination, and stars Michel de Souza and Patrick Terry. Royal Opera House: Linbury Theatre, WC2 Wednesday 25 September to Friday 4 October; touring to Monday 4 November Bittersweet Metropolis Any series devoted to the music of the Weimar republic must explore the cabaret that flourished in Germany in the 1920s, and the second half of the Philharmonia\u2019s Weimar series begins with an evening devoted to the images, words and music that came out of that explosion of artistic energy. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts, as he does the more conventional final pair of concerts, featuring music by Hindemith, Berg, Weill and Busoni. Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Monday 23 September; Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Thursday 26 &amp; Sunday 29 September Carmen Welsh National Opera\u2019s first season under its new general director Aidan Lang opens with a new staging of one of the staples of any company\u2019s repertory. Jo Davies directs what is promised as an updating of Bizet\u2019s masterpiece, set in Central America in the 1970s. In the initial cast, Virginie Verrez takes the title role, with Dimitri Pittas as Don Jos\u00e9 and Phillip Rhodes as Escamillo. Wales Millennium Centre: Donald Gordon Theatre, Cardiff, Sat 21 September to Thursday 10 October; touring to Thursday 7 May Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Otobong Nkanga Maps of the spaces between us and the hidden forces that connect us \u2013 desire and fear, money and power \u2013 give the work of this Nigeria-born, Belgium-based artist a cosmic mystery. She uses tapestry as well as painting and video to weave her lyrical images of the threads of human community and the world economy. Tate St Ives Saturday 21 September to Sunday 5 January Antony Gormley One of Britain\u2019s most popular artists brings his mixture of spectacle and simplicity to London in what is sure to be a hit show. In recent years, Gormley has branched out in all directions \u2013 from hotel design to mass participation \u2013 but the expressionless casts of the human figure that are his trademark remain his most convincing images. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Saturday 21 September to Tuesday 3 December Mark Leckey A full-sized replica of a Merseyside motorway bridge that hung over the artist\u2019s childhood is the centrepiece of this journey through memory, myth and pop culture. A radio drama about kids, changelings and Leckey\u2019s own early years will haunt this grandiose and brutal setting. At his best this artist is a hallucinatory archaeologist of contemporary life. At his worst he\u2019s like a loud but vacant music festival where nothing adds up to much. Tate Britain, SW1, Tuesday 24 September to Sunday 5 January The Art of Innovation Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg\u2019s painting Coalbrookdale By Night is a masterpiece of Romantic art yet belongs to the Science Museum. Why? Because art and technology were as entwined in the Industrial Revolution as they are today. This blockbuster explores two centuries of art and science and also includes futurist sculptures, installations inspired by contemporary physics, and what may be the art of AI. Science Museum, SW7, Wednesday 25 September to Sunday 26 January Anna Maria Maiolino Bizarre organic effusions made of mud sprout from the imagination of this artist, born in Italy in the last years of Mussolini, who moved to Brazil when she was 18 only to live under a similarly brutal regime. Maiolino is a dissident artist whose subversion ranges from sensual sketches of fantastic worlds to films that defied the military. A masterclass in the art of resistance. Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Wednesday 25 September to Sunday 12 January JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows The Watsons Laura Wade\u2019s adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s unfinished novel was the big hit of last year\u2019s Chichester festival. It is, however, no scissors-and-paste job but, in Samuel West\u2019s production, a brilliantly witty examination of who actually owns a story: is it the author or the characters themselves? Expect to be constantly surprised by Wade\u2019s ceaseless invention. The Menier Chocolate Factory, SE1 to Saturday 16 November \u2018Master Harold\u2019 \u2026 and the Boys Lucian Msamati and Hammed Animashaun star in Athol Fugard\u2019s terrific play about the close relationship between a Port Elizabeth schoolboy and two of his parents\u2019 black employees in training for a dance championship. But this is 1950s South Africa where even friendship is circumscribed by the cruel laws of apartheid. National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, Saturday 21 September to Tuesday 17 December Macbeth There must be a reason why Shakespeare\u2019s study of the perils of vaulting ambition is everywhere this autumn. Could it be that the play has suddenly acquired a dangerous topicality? Here, John Simm becomes the murderous thane with Dervla Kirwan as his dagger-wielding wife. Paul Miller, who is doing great things at Richmond\u2019s Orange Tree and who directed Simm\u2019s Hamlet in Sheffield, is in charge of proceedings. Chichester Festival Theatre, Saturday 21 September to Saturday 26 October Assassins Even by Stephen Sondheim\u2019s standards, this was a daring show: \u201can anti-musical about anti-heroes,\u201d as the New York Times put it, exploring nine actual, or would-be, presidential assassins. In fact, the show, with a book by John Weidman, says a lot about the American dream and evokes the rich sound of the nation\u2019s music. It is directed by Bill Buckhurst, who did a superb Sweet Charity at Nottingham Playhouse, where this production heads after. West Berkshire Playhouse: The Watermill, Newbury, Thursday 26 September to Saturday 26 October The Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort\u2019s memoir about his life as a stock market millionaire and federal convict has already been turned into a Martin Scorsese movie. Now it becomes an immersive theatre experience taking place over four floors of a London office block. Coming from the team that created a similarly immersive version of The Great Gatsby, it should be a memorably involving event. Stratton Oakmont, EC2, to Sunday 19 January MB Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Boy Blue: Redd East London hip-hop company Boy Blue moved up to the next level with its last outing, the acclaimed Blak Whyte Gray, so expectations are high for Redd. It is not a continuation of the misspelled colour theme but from the Gaelic word that means to put things in order, in this case about finding peace after trauma. Barbican Theatre, EC2 Thursday 26 September to Saturday 5 October Gary Clarke Company: Wasteland The sequel to Clarke\u2019s Coal, which looked at the miners\u2019 strike in his home town of Grimethorpe, Wasteland asks what happened next in the post-industrial north and finds an unexpected answer in the rise of rave culture. Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne, Wednesday 25 &amp; Thursday 26 September; touring to Wednesday 4 March Rosie Kay Dance Company: Fantasia What would the most joyful, beautiful, pleasurable dance you could make look like? Rosie Kay attempts to go some way to answering that in a work informed by neuroscientific research into audience aesthetics. Birmingham Hippodrome, Wednesday 25 &amp; Thursday 26 September; touring to Thursday 21 November LW",

He later recalled his thoughts as he ejected and contemplated his impending capture: \u201cFive years down there, at least. I\u2019m leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus.\u201d We all react differently, and unpredictably, in moments of great peril: in this case Stockdale was drawn back to an inspirational philosophy class he had taken three years earlier, and to a period when he was obsessively reading a relatively little-known ancient Greek philosopher.</p> <p>Epictetus himself was a former slave who taught Stoic philosophy in the late first and early second centuries, first in Rome and then in northern Greece. Along with the Roman writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/27/seneca-fat-cat-philosopher-emily-wilson-a-life\" title=\"\">Seneca</a> and (the emperor) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/28/marcus-aurelius\" title=\"\">Marcus Aurelius</a>, he left us the longest surviving treatises on Stoicism, an ancient Greek philosophical doctrine that originated in the third century BCE. The Stoics (who originally gathered in the <em>stoa</em> or colonnade in the Athenian agora) offered a comprehensive theory of existence, covering physics, language, psychology, theology, sense perception and much more; but the doctrine was at its base an art of good living. We should concern ourselves only with what we can control (what is <em>eph\u2019h\u0113min</em>, \u201cup to us\u201d), and leave the rest; we must pursue only things of real value such as enhancing collective happiness, not \u201cthings of indifference\u201d such as wealth and the respect of our peers; we must allow ourselves to be guided by reason, and not dominated by the passions, which lessen our self-control. These were the lessons that Stockdale repeated to himself through what turned out to be seven and a half years of often brutal captivity. \u201cYou may fetter my leg,\u201d Epictetus had written, \u201cbut not even Zeus himself can overpower my will.\u201d</p> <p>In turning to Stoicism, Stockdale was ahead of his time.

Ancient Stoicism was much more broad-ranging, complex, and indeed weird, than Sellars lets on. You won\u2019t read anything here about the theory of language based on cognitive impressions or the idea that the universe goes through periodic cycles of conflagration and renewal. Sellars skirts the Stoics\u2019 belief in a designer deity, arguing that \u2018God\u2019 is simply a way of thinking about nature and the animate interconnectedness of the universe (and comparing James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia hypothesis). But this underplays the role of providence: ancient Stoics and Stoic-influenced writers often speak about their god as supremely rational and ordering the events of the world for the best.

But Sellars doesn\u2019t give us the full story. What Musonius actually thought was that women and men are differently equipped by nature. Learning philosophy does not make women equal to men; it just makes them better at the tasks to which they\u2019re suited (spinning, weaving, childrearing). Some of Sellars\u2019s paraphrases of ancient ideas, moreover, may accurately reflect ancient beliefs, but sit rather awkwardly in a 21st-century ethical context: for example, \u201cnone of us has chosen our \u2026 gender\u201d; \u201ca healthy relationship is one based on natural desires for companionship and procreation\u201d.</p> <p>But what is striking is not that ancient and modern thought sometimes misalign: it\u2019s that, in spite of that misalignment, Stoicism retains so much appeal for modern readers. The reasons for this popularity are several. There is certainly an extent to which Stoicism responds to modern \u201cself-help\u201d culture. There is also a kind of lurking machismo to its heroisation of endurance and suffering. Most of all, however, it is that maligned, embattled, but nonetheless tenacious idea of rationality that keeps drawing the readers. Few today would agree that reason alone could ever be sovereign in human decision-making, to the exclusion of emotions, group dynamics, the unconscious, the body, and instincts honed by evolutionary adaptation. But it is reason alone that can help us change, develop and take control of our lives; and the Stoic message that we must do all we can to nurture this powerful but brittle gift is timeless and ever-necessary.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lessons in Stoicism: What Ancient Philosophers Teach Us about How to Live is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a39.99) .

And as the civil rights attorney who helped establish the Rooney Rule \u2013 which requires NFL teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations jobs \u2013 he understood the deeper significance of the moment for a league that long has excluded African Americans from its most important and celebrated on-field position.</p> <p>\u201cKyler Murray showed maturity beyond his years,\u201d Mehri said. \u201cThey had no running game. The stadium is so loud. It was 100% on him. And he carved up the defense.</p> <p>\u201cThen you look at Lamar Jackson. His field awareness was so impressive. He can sense the pass rush and escape. He places the ball with nice touch. He\u2019s showing the complete game.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to overcome 100 years \u2013 literally 100 years! \u2013 of stereotyping of black quarterbacks. And they demolished all of them in that one game.\u201d</p> <p>As the NFL celebrates its centennial season, the league is experiencing a changing of its quarterback guard. Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/andrew-luck-retires-indianapolis-colts-quarterback\">retired</a>. Eli Manning has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/17/eli-manning-benched-new-york-giants\">benched</a>. Ben Roethlisberger is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/17/drew-brees-ben-roethlisberger-injuries-nfl-playoffs\">out for the season</a>, and faces an uncertain future.</p> <p>Health permitting, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Phillip Rivers continue to truck along \u2013 but each is far closer to the end of their careers than the beginning.</p> <p>All of those players are white. Meanwhile, the NFL\u2019s most promising and accomplished young signal-callers are predominantly black: not just Jackson and Murray, but also Dallas\u2019 Dak Prescott (26 years old), Houston\u2019s Deshaun Watson (24), and Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes (24).</p> <p>And that\u2019s not all. As Jason Reid of <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/a-look-at-black-quarterbacks-dominating-the-nfl/\">The Undefeated has noted</a>, 2019 marks the first year in which the league\u2019s reigning MVP (Mahomes), No 1 overall pick (Murray), highest-paid player (Seattle\u2019s Russell Wilson), and a former MVP (Carolina\u2019s Cam Newton) are all African American quarterbacks.</p> <p>Small wonder, then, that Reid\u2019s website has declared this <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/tag/year-of-the-black-qb/\">\u201cthe year of the black QB\u201d</a>. Yet that same excellence raises a question: given that <a href=\"https://qz.com/1287915/the-nfls-racial-makeup-explains-much-of-its-national-anthem-problems/\">roughly 70%</a> of NFL players are African American, why has it taken so long for the league\u2019s marquee position to begin to follow suit?</p> <p>The answer lies in a lengthy history of overt discrimination and subtle bias \u2013 and a determined, multi-generational effort by black athletes to overcome both.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you get from there to here?\u201d Mehri says. \u201cYou build a wall of integration. Bit by bit. Brick by brick.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Separate and unequal</strong></h2> <p>The NFL\u2019s story began with a standout African American quarterback: Fritz Pollard, a chemistry major and All-American at Brown University, led the Akron Pros to the league\u2019s inaugural championship in 1920.</p> <p>In 1933, however, the NFL secretly decided to ban black players \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/a-history-of-segregation-in-the-nfl/248625/\">reportedly at the behest</a> of former Washington owner George Preston Marshall, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/sports/football/50-years-ago-redskins-were-last-nfl-team-to-integrate.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">committed segregationist</a> who in a 1942 interview argued that if African Americans were allowed to play, \u201cwhite players, especially those from the South, would go to extremes to physically disable them\u201d.</p> <p>The ban mirrored the status of black Americans at the time: separate, unequal and living in a de facto apartheid state via Jim Crow in the South and a patchwork of exclusionary laws and customs everywhere else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"951ec3347f77cb01106f72ca8752e08667ce02eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/951ec3347f77cb01106f72ca8752e08667ce02eb/0_0_3000_2303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denver Post ArchivesDEC 14 1968, DEC 15 1968 Denver Broncos (Action) Denver quarterback Marlin Briscoe is unaware that a battle is occurring behind him in the first quarter Saturday.

In the early part of the 20th century, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and sports sociologist, whites assumed that African-Americans lacked the physical stamina and emotional courage to excel at contact sports like boxing and football.</p> <p>After Jack Johnson became the first African American heavyweight champion in 1908 \u2013 and then defeated \u201cgreat white hope\u201d James J Jeffries in a 1910 bout that triggered white race riots across the country \u2013 that assumption morphed.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the Negro Leagues in baseball, and similar kinds of [segregated black] teams in football and basketball,\u201d Coakley said. \u201cSo what happened over time is that the racial ideology changed.</p> <p>\u201cWhites accepted that blacks were physically evolved, but decided that they were intellectually un-evolved \u2013 that they were actually lower on the ladder of evolution than white people, and somehow closer to our animal ancestors. And that\u2019s the ideology, the cultural context, that prevailed when the major sports in the US were desegregated.\u201d</p> <p>Though the NFL lifted the ban in 1946, opportunities for African American quarterbacks were almost nonexistent. George Taliaferro became the league\u2019s second ever black quarterback in 1950, and even made three Pro Bowls \u2013 but only as a rusher and receiver who never completed more than 16 passes in a season.</p> <p>The league\u2019s third black quarterback, Willie Thrower, was given even less of a chance to make a mark. In 1953, the Chicago Bears inserted him for a single drive against the San Francisco 49ers \u2013 and after Thrower completed three of eight passes to put his team in the red zone, replaced him with white starter George Blanda.</p> <p>In sportswriter William C Rhoden\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Third-Mile-Vick-Triumphs-Quarterback/dp/1933060115\">Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumph of the Black Quarterback</a><em>, </em>Thrower\u2019s son, Melvin, recalled that his parents owned a bar called \u201cThe Touchdown Lounge\u201d, with a picture of his father on the wall.</p> <p>\u201cOn the bottom, it said: THE FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL, 1953,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cPeople told him to take it down. \u2018You\u2019re lying,\u2019 they said. \u2018You\u2019re lying. That ain\u2019t you.

A<a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/implicit-bias-and-the-nfl-draft/\"> 2004 study of football scouting publications</a> found that white athletes were more likely to be praised for mental abilities, while blacks received physical compliments. A <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2017-08-racial-stereotypes-perception-nfl-quarterbacks.html\">pair of 2017 studies</a> found that white <em>and</em> black college students were more likely to describe pro quarterbacks in stereotypical ways than not, and that whites in general assigned stereotypes to black signal-callers but not to white ones.</p> <p>In 2009, an economics professor examined NFL data from the previous decade and concluded that black quarterbacks were <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1527002515609659%0A\">roughly two times more likely</a> to be benched than their white peers when controlling for factors including injury, age, experience, and performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91aa64cf2be5a4c883aaab7712e1b76255c848bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91aa64cf2be5a4c883aaab7712e1b76255c848bf/0_0_3000_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Mahomes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes threw for 50 touchdowns, 5,097 yards and had a 113.8 QB rating last year, becoming the youngest player to win the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player award since Dan Marino in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirk Irwin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/apr/27/nfl-draft-african-american-quarterback-deshone-kizer\">a Guardian analysis of the previous seven league drafts</a> showed that the average pick for a black quarterback was 70th overall as opposed to 53rd for a white quarterback \u2013 even though those same black quarterbacks had a career passer rating slightly above 90.0, higher than the average rating for their white counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes a couple of generations to change the legacy of racial ideology,\u201d Coakley said. \u201cIt\u2019s dying a slow death.

      "bodyText": "From his seat at M&amp;T Bank Stadium during last weekend\u2019s NFL game between the Baltimore Ravens and Arizona Cardinals, Cyrus Mehri knew he was witnessing something special. In a matchup of the youngest African American starting quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era, 22-year-old Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, the top pick in this year\u2019s draft, threw for 349 yards in only his second professional contest. Not to be outdone, second-year Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, also 22, became the only player in regular-season league history to throw for at least 270 yards and rush for at least 120 yards, leading Baltimore to a 23-17 victory. As a fan, Mehri was thrilled. And as the civil rights attorney who helped establish the Rooney Rule \u2013 which requires NFL teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations jobs \u2013 he understood the deeper significance of the moment for a league that long has excluded African Americans from its most important and celebrated on-field position. \u201cKyler Murray showed maturity beyond his years,\u201d Mehri said. \u201cThey had no running game. The stadium is so loud. It was 100% on him. And he carved up the defense. \u201cThen you look at Lamar Jackson. His field awareness was so impressive. He can sense the pass rush and escape. He places the ball with nice touch. He\u2019s showing the complete game. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to overcome 100 years \u2013 literally 100 years! \u2013 of stereotyping of black quarterbacks. And they demolished all of them in that one game.\u201d As the NFL celebrates its centennial season, the league is experiencing a changing of its quarterback guard. Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck are retired. Eli Manning has been benched. Ben Roethlisberger is out for the season, and faces an uncertain future. Health permitting, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Phillip Rivers continue to truck along \u2013 but each is far closer to the end of their careers than the beginning. All of those players are white. Meanwhile, the NFL\u2019s most promising and accomplished young signal-callers are predominantly black: not just Jackson and Murray, but also Dallas\u2019 Dak Prescott (26 years old), Houston\u2019s Deshaun Watson (24), and Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes (24). And that\u2019s not all. As Jason Reid of The Undefeated has noted, 2019 marks the first year in which the league\u2019s reigning MVP (Mahomes), No 1 overall pick (Murray), highest-paid player (Seattle\u2019s Russell Wilson), and a former MVP (Carolina\u2019s Cam Newton) are all African American quarterbacks. Small wonder, then, that Reid\u2019s website has declared this \u201cthe year of the black QB\u201d. Yet that same excellence raises a question: given that roughly 70% of NFL players are African American, why has it taken so long for the league\u2019s marquee position to begin to follow suit? The answer lies in a lengthy history of overt discrimination and subtle bias \u2013 and a determined, multi-generational effort by black athletes to overcome both. \u201cHow do you get from there to here?\u201d Mehri says. \u201cYou build a wall of integration. Bit by bit. Brick by brick.\u201d Separate and unequal The NFL\u2019s story began with a standout African American quarterback: Fritz Pollard, a chemistry major and All-American at Brown University, led the Akron Pros to the league\u2019s inaugural championship in 1920. In 1933, however, the NFL secretly decided to ban black players \u2013 reportedly at the behest of former Washington owner George Preston Marshall, a committed segregationist who in a 1942 interview argued that if African Americans were allowed to play, \u201cwhite players, especially those from the South, would go to extremes to physically disable them\u201d. The ban mirrored the status of black Americans at the time: separate, unequal and living in a de facto apartheid state via Jim Crow in the South and a patchwork of exclusionary laws and customs everywhere else. The ban also was rooted in the widespread, racist beliefs about black inferiority that underpinned segregation. In the early part of the 20th century, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and sports sociologist, whites assumed that African-Americans lacked the physical stamina and emotional courage to excel at contact sports like boxing and football. After Jack Johnson became the first African American heavyweight champion in 1908 \u2013 and then defeated \u201cgreat white hope\u201d James J Jeffries in a 1910 bout that triggered white race riots across the country \u2013 that assumption morphed. \u201cYou had the Negro Leagues in baseball, and similar kinds of [segregated black] teams in football and basketball,\u201d Coakley said. \u201cSo what happened over time is that the racial ideology changed. \u201cWhites accepted that blacks were physically evolved, but decided that they were intellectually un-evolved \u2013 that they were actually lower on the ladder of evolution than white people, and somehow closer to our animal ancestors. And that\u2019s the ideology, the cultural context, that prevailed when the major sports in the US were desegregated.\u201d Though the NFL lifted the ban in 1946, opportunities for African American quarterbacks were almost nonexistent. George Taliaferro became the league\u2019s second ever black quarterback in 1950, and even made three Pro Bowls \u2013 but only as a rusher and receiver who never completed more than 16 passes in a season. The league\u2019s third black quarterback, Willie Thrower, was given even less of a chance to make a mark. In 1953, the Chicago Bears inserted him for a single drive against the San Francisco 49ers \u2013 and after Thrower completed three of eight passes to put his team in the red zone, replaced him with white starter George Blanda. In sportswriter William C Rhoden\u2019s book Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumph of the Black Quarterback, Thrower\u2019s son, Melvin, recalled that his parents owned a bar called \u201cThe Touchdown Lounge\u201d, with a picture of his father on the wall. \u201cOn the bottom, it said: THE FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL, 1953,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cPeople told him to take it down. \u2018You\u2019re lying,\u2019 they said. \u2018You\u2019re lying. That ain\u2019t you. Take it down.\u2019\u201d Stacked deck As football and American society continued to desegregate in the 1960s and 70s, the sport was rife with what sociologists call \u201cracial stacking\u201d \u2013 a sorting process in which individuals are funneled into certain positions based on stereotypes. From Pop Warner to the NFL, the down-the-middle positions of center, inside linebacker and quarterback were considered to be \u201cthinking\u201d spots. As such, they were seen as too cerebral for African American athletes, who additionally were thought to lack the leadership and grit to lead other players and perform under duress. Of course, this was balderdash. Sandy Stephens quarterbacked the University of Minnesota to a national championship in 1960, and many other black signal-callers at the game\u2019s lower levels proved perfectly capable when called upon; meanwhile, plenty of white quarterbacks tossed interceptions, made boneheaded mistakes and otherwise labored in utter mediocrity. Nevertheless, stacking had a pernicious, two-pronged effect: drastically reducing the pool of African American college quarterbacks who conceivably could be signed by a NFL team, and making it almost impossible for one of them to get a fair shake in the league. Ken Shropshire, who competed with and against African American quarterbacks in a predominantly black high school league in Los Angeles, experienced stacking for the first time while playing for Stanford University in the 1970s. Black teammates James Lofton and Tony Hill both had been prep signal-callers. Both were converted to wide receivers in college. \u201cI learned that was a regular thing,\u201d said Shropshire, the CEO of the Global Sport Institute at Arizona State University and author of the book In Black and White: Race and Sports in America. \u201cIronically, we had a contest in practice for who on the team could throw the ball the longest. James Lofton would win every year.\u201d When Denver drafted Marlin Briscoe in 1968, the Broncos told Omaha University\u2019s star quarterback that they wanted him to play defensive back. Briscoe had other ideas. Nicknamed \u201cthe Magician,\u201d he insisted that he wouldn\u2019t sign unless the Broncos allowed him to participate in a three-day quarterback tryout at the start of training camp. \u201cThey thought I was crazy,\u201d said Briscoe, who grew up idolizing Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. \u201cIt was unheard of to see a black man play QB in the pros. But all I wanted to do was showcase my skills.\u201d The tryout, Briscoe said, went as he expected. Seven other quarterbacks, all of them white, got to make 10 throws during drills. Briscoe always went last, and got \u201cmaybe seven or eight\u201d. At the end of camp, Denver named Briscoe a starter \u2013 at cornerback. But after starting quarterback Steve Tensi was injured and backup Joe DiVito struggled during the Broncos\u2019 home opener, coach Lou Saban put Briscoe in under center. Briscoe completed his first pass for 22 yards. He later drove Denver 80 yards, scored on a 12-yard run, and nearly led the Broncos to a comeback win. A week later, he became the first black starting quarterback in pro football\u2019s modern era \u2013 and ultimately finished the season as the runner-up for AFL rookie of the year, compiling five starts, 1,589 passing yards, 308 rushing yards and 14 touchdown passes. The following summer, Briscoe went back to Omaha to take college courses. His phone rang. \u201cDenver was having quarterback meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cHere I am, the starting QB at the end of the season, and I didn\u2019t even get an invitation to the competition.\u201d Briscoe flew to Denver. He discovered his services under center were no longer needed. \u201cI never did get an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I understood what was going on.\u201d He ended up in Buffalo, where he played receiver and was named All-Pro before winning two Super Bowls catching passes for the Miami Dolphins. Briscoe never played quarterback in the NFL again. But he had broken an important barrier. \u201cWhen I got to Denver, it was always thought that you\u2019d have a fan backlash, a player backlash, that whites wouldn\u2019t root or play for a black quarterback,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, that was a myth. \u201cMy offensive line, they were all from the south. Not only had they never played for a black QB, but prior to the pros, they had never played with black players. And the first thing out of their mouths was, \u2018don\u2019t let \u2018em touch the Magician.\u2019 \u201cFor them to embrace me, for the fans to embrace me, that was validating. And I knew that I had to succeed. If I didn\u2019t prove that I could do it, then how long would it take for another black quarterback to get a chance?\u201d Forward progress Other trailblazers followed. James \u201cShack\u201d Harris \u2013 Briscoe\u2019s roommate and mentee in Buffalo \u2013 became the first African American quarterback to start a NFL season opener, start and win a playoff game, play in the Pro Bowl and be selected Pro Bowl MVP. In 1978, Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to be selected in the NFL draft\u2019s first round. Nine years later, he made history again by starting and winning the Super Bowl with Washington. Meanwhile, Warren Moon \u2013 who went undrafted after wining a Rose Bowl with the University of Washington \u2013 won five straight championships in Canada before signing with the Houston Oilers and embarking on a prolific 17-year NFL career that made him the first black quarterback inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Like Briscoe, the African American signal-callers who came after in the 1970s and 80s couldn\u2019t be merely average. They had be exceptional. They were given less time to develop than their white peers, and less leeway to make mistakes. They also had to fight against a racialized conception of how a pro quarterback was supposed to play. Tall, statuesque pocket passers were the gold standard. Shorter, more mobile ones were seen as fragile and unreliable. Coming out of college football, white quarterbacks tended to fit in the former category, black quarterbacks the latter. According to former NFL player and sports historian Mike Oriard, it\u2019s no coincidence that the 6ft 4in, 235lb Williams wasn\u2019t considered much of a running threat \u2013 or that Williams\u2019 college coach, Grambling State legend Eddie Robinson, told Harris not to run the 40-yard dash for league scouts, the better to avoid a positional switch. \u201cThe rise of black quarterbacks created the idea of the white quarterback,\u201d said Oriard, an emeritus professor and dean at Oregon State University. \u201cBefore the stereotype emerged that black QBs were athletic, there were no distinctive characteristics associated with white quarterbacks.\u201d By winning NFL games with their arms and their legs, Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick helped change attitudes toward black quarterbacks with fleet feet. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, white signal-callers who could run and scramble, like Fran Tarkenton and Steve Young, were seldom disparaged as merely \u201cathletic.\u201d) Concurrently, the evolution of the pro game turned a perceived liability into a strength. As passing became paramount and pass rushers faster and more punishing, quarterbacks who could escape the pocket, make throws on the move and turn surefire sacks into gains became increasingly valuable. At the college level, black quarterbacks have become much more commonplace: since 2010, at least one African American signal-caller has started in the national championship game. Mehri believes that has produced a trickle-up effect in the NFL, as social science research indicates that companies are nearly 200 times more likely to hire a minority candidate if the finalist pool for a job includes more than one minority. Of the league\u2019s 90 quarterbacks currently active or on injured reserve, 19 (21 percent) are black \u2013 which means African Americans remain underrepresented at the position. Nevertheless, Shropshire believes that the gap is closing, and that the league is as close to being an on-field meritocracy as it has ever been. \u201cFor those of us who follow this closely, the moment you sort of know is when you can no longer name all of the black quarterbacks in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happened for me a couple of years ago.\u201d Brick by brick Some bias still lingers. A 2004 study of football scouting publications found that white athletes were more likely to be praised for mental abilities, while blacks received physical compliments. A pair of 2017 studies found that white and black college students were more likely to describe pro quarterbacks in stereotypical ways than not, and that whites in general assigned stereotypes to black signal-callers but not to white ones. In 2009, an economics professor examined NFL data from the previous decade and concluded that black quarterbacks were roughly two times more likely to be benched than their white peers when controlling for factors including injury, age, experience, and performance. Two years ago, a Guardian analysis of the previous seven league drafts showed that the average pick for a black quarterback was 70th overall as opposed to 53rd for a white quarterback \u2013 even though those same black quarterbacks had a career passer rating slightly above 90.0, higher than the average rating for their white counterparts. \u201cIt takes a couple of generations to change the legacy of racial ideology,\u201d Coakley said. \u201cIt\u2019s dying a slow death. And we may be at a point where it is grasping to its last breaths.\u201d Tell that to Baltimore\u2019s Jackson. Prior to the draft, veteran NFL executive Bill Polian suggested that the youngest-ever Heisman trophy winner would be better off playing receiver in the pros, while others raised concerns about Jackson\u2019s ability to read defenses. In response, Jackson declined to run the 40-yard dash for scouts. He opened this season by throwing five touchdown passes in a 59-10 victory over Miami, then told reporters, \u201cnot bad for a running back.\u201d After out-dueling Murray, he had Ravens coach John Harbaugh deliver a more pointed message, one more brick in a wall of integration: not bad for a quarterback. \u201cTo see how these kids have evolved from the era I played in and dispelled the myth that a black man could not think and throw and lead at that level, it\u2019s just gratifying,\u201d Briscoe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far. And it\u2019s a long time coming.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A doctor and labour activist in Zimbabwe whose reported abduction led to widespread protests by medical staff has been found, disoriented and in pain but alive. Peter Magombeyi, the acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA), disappeared at about 10pm (2100 BST) local time on Saturday. The union leader sent a short message to colleagues saying he believed he was being kidnapped before all communications ceased. Magombeyi, who is leading a nationwide doctors\u2019 strike to force President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government to raise wages for medical staff, had previously received warnings, which he believed came from security services, to stop his activism. The exact circumstances of his release are unclear, with Magombeyi unable to give interviewers coherent details of what happened to him. He was found in Nyabira, about 18 miles (30km) from the capital, Harare. Interviewed by a reporter from Voice of America, Magombeyi sounded confused. He said he had no obvious physical injuries, but some pain. He told VOA he remembered \u201cbeing in a basement of some sort, being electrocuted at some point\u201d. Hundreds of Zimbabwean doctors protested in central Harare during the week over the disappearance of Magombeyi. The ZHDA represents mainly junior doctors at public hospitals. Doctors are among millions of public employees in Zimbabwe who have suffered from soaring inflation and a shortage of currency and basic commodities. The health sector faces a severe lack of medicine and funds. Dozens of pro-democracy campaigners, trade unionists and opposition officials have been abducted by suspected state security services since contested elections last year. Most have been released after several hours, though many have been badly beaten, stripped, threatened or otherwise mistreated. Government ministers and senior officials suggested the apparent abduction of Magombeyi had been carried out by a \u201cthird force\u201d to destabilise the country. Nick Mangwana, the information secretary, described Magombeyi as a \u201cliar\u201d after his release. Allegations that unidentified third parties were undermining authorities were a staple under Robert Mugabe, the previous president, who died this month in a clinic in Singapore. Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced to resign after a military takeover in November 2017. He was succeeded by Mnangagwa, who promised to bring foreign investment to avert a deepening economic crisis, reform government and rehabilitate the former British colony\u2019s international image. Zimbabwe is crippled by massive debts incurred during Mugabe\u2019s rule and needs a multibillion-dollar bailout to prevent economic collapse. However, continuing repression and a lack of tangible political reform means there is little chance of international institutions offering major aid packages.",

      "bodyText": "Over the last 20 years, Cornwall\u2019s Red River Dialect have been twisting together folk-rock, Americana and spiritualism. Ringleader and songwriter David Morris is the son of an Anglican priest, brought up near Tintagel; he\u2019s now an active Buddhist, having recently emerged from a nine-month retreat. His band\u2019s last two albums \u2013 2015\u2019s Tender Gold and Gentle Blue and 2018\u2019s Broken Stay Open Sky \u2013 played like moving responses to the sudden death of his father. Their fifth (and second on the lovingly curated North Carolina independent label, Paradise of Bachelors) appears as a wide-eyed, curious creature, willingly alert to the world. Nowhere better is this articulated than on Red River, an ornately produced track full of shivering strings that traces the roots of the band\u2019s name (a Canadian creole language combining English, Orkney Scots, Scottish Gaelic, Cree and Ojibwe). As it explores and criticises colonialism \u2013 \u201cI take the name\u201d, Morris sings \u2013 his voice sways between lushness and anxiety, the lyric simultaneously seducing and disquieting. Fans of Will Oldham will find succour in Morris\u2019 quivering, occasionally out-of-tune croon, which works best in the contemplations of Salvation (\u201cSalvation has a hold / On the mind that is not bold\u201d), and when the lyrics suggest faltering on Slow Rush (\u201clooking for shortcuts, hopping the lakes\u201d). Although it sounds and feels transatlantic, British inspirations flood this record, from its Mabinogion-referencing artwork to its recording in rural Carmarthenshire. A meditation on Wales\u2019 highest peak, Snowdon, is momentous, if a shade over-earnest, Joan Shelley\u2019s backing vocals giving welcome lightness (her recent album Like the River Loves the Sea is a slow-burning beauty). Two White Carp also feels thick with the mud of a familiar river, but the spaciousness in the arrangements of Piano and Blue Sparks, allowing in silence like Talk Talk did in their later songs, lets the spirituality of the songs filter in. Also out this month Yet another Alasdair Roberts album, and a profoundly moving one. The Fiery Margin (Drag City) explores Europe through the story of a Nazi prisoner, contemporary politics and peace, medieval mystics on False Flesh, and the death of a child on the shattering A Keen. Welsh-born duo Peiriant\u2019s self-titled LP (NAWR Records) sculpts startling instrumentals from the bones of folk music, guitar delays and deep drones.

The plot, and it\u2019s excessively generous of me to call it that, sees Galifianakis in hot water after almost drowning guest Matthew McConaughey in cold water during an on-set accident which also destroys the show\u2019s lo-fi set. His hateful boss Will Ferrell soon arrives with an intimidating proposal: to save himself he must film 10 new episodes in two weeks while on the road, ending up in LA to deliver the tapes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjljgkCQv5c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OjljgkCQv5c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What follows is as scrappy as one would expect, a thinly drawn road trip caper sandwiching all-too-brief clips of celebrities deflecting cruel verbal jabs. It\u2019s predictably in these moments that the film proves funniest with a long list of stars lining up for some wonderfully unrestrained attacks. Highlights include an assault on Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s unusual looks (\u201cthe type of face that masturbates all day wearing a helmet\u201d), Jon Hamm\u2019s comedy Tag (\u201cone of the most iconic pieces of mediocrity ever created\u201d), Paul Rudd\u2019s career (\u201cWhich do you prefer: being in Marvel movies or being in stuff that nobody\u2019s ever heard of?\u201d) and Matthew McConaughey\u2019s recent career choices (\u201cAll right, all right, all right \u2026 sorry I was just reading the box office returns for your last three movies\u201d). As evidenced by his utter lack of vanity throughout his work to date, Galifianakis is also the subject of numerous putdowns (a colleague refers to him as an \u201cabsolute piece of shit garbage rat loser\u201d while Ferrell calls him \u201cso dumb and so fat\u201d).</p> <p>Given the current sorry state of feature-length comedy, there are enough laughs here to automatically make it funnier than most of its bigger, and more ambitious, big-screen counterparts.

      "bodyText": "There are saving graces scattered throughout Zach Galifianakis\u2019s featherweight extension of his amateur talkshow Between Two Ferns, a ramshackle full-length excuse to watch him be mean to squirming in-on-the-joke A-listers. But perhaps the film\u2019s overwhelming ace is an overarching awareness of just how pointless it really is, made with the same disposability with which it should be consumed. Tasked with transporting Funny Or Die\u2019s often hysterically funny webseries into a Netflix movie, writer-director and Two Ferns co-creator Scott Aukerman has aimed low and mostly, kind of, succeeded. The plot, and it\u2019s excessively generous of me to call it that, sees Galifianakis in hot water after almost drowning guest Matthew McConaughey in cold water during an on-set accident which also destroys the show\u2019s lo-fi set. His hateful boss Will Ferrell soon arrives with an intimidating proposal: to save himself he must film 10 new episodes in two weeks while on the road, ending up in LA to deliver the tapes. What follows is as scrappy as one would expect, a thinly drawn road trip caper sandwiching all-too-brief clips of celebrities deflecting cruel verbal jabs. It\u2019s predictably in these moments that the film proves funniest with a long list of stars lining up for some wonderfully unrestrained attacks. Highlights include an assault on Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s unusual looks (\u201cthe type of face that masturbates all day wearing a helmet\u201d), Jon Hamm\u2019s comedy Tag (\u201cone of the most iconic pieces of mediocrity ever created\u201d), Paul Rudd\u2019s career (\u201cWhich do you prefer: being in Marvel movies or being in stuff that nobody\u2019s ever heard of?\u201d) and Matthew McConaughey\u2019s recent career choices (\u201cAll right, all right, all right \u2026 sorry I was just reading the box office returns for your last three movies\u201d). As evidenced by his utter lack of vanity throughout his work to date, Galifianakis is also the subject of numerous putdowns (a colleague refers to him as an \u201cabsolute piece of shit garbage rat loser\u201d while Ferrell calls him \u201cso dumb and so fat\u201d). Given the current sorry state of feature-length comedy, there are enough laughs here to automatically make it funnier than most of its bigger, and more ambitious, big-screen counterparts. But as hilarious as it might be when it\u2019s focused on ridiculing the rich and famous, it\u2019s equally forgettable when trained on its barebones narrative. There are brief moments of inspired silliness outside of the interview format, like Orange is the New Black\u2019s Lauren Lapkus airing her confusion over what a chicken strip is or a surprise cameo from Chrissy Teigen who reveals that her origins story is essentially the plot of The Box, but it\u2019s mostly filler. There\u2019s also just too much of it in comparison to the talkshow segments, which are all frustratingly short. Movies based on TV shows are often criticised for feeling like a stitched together bumper edition of episodes but in this instance, I\u2019d have been happy for that to be the case, sandwiched between two ferns rather than aimlessly out on the road.

However, such fears prove unfounded: franchise returnees will find Borderlands 3 reassuringly familiar.

Most notably, the chance to choose between four distinct types of Vault Hunters: Moze, the tank, Amara, the siren with tasty melee skills, FL4K, who takes trained beasts into combat, and Zane, who employees technology such as a hovering turret or a hologram of himself. The only problem is that you have to choose between them at the start of the game, and there\u2019s no way of switching once you\u2019re underway.

The Selma director\u2019s acclaimed drama about the Central Park Five boasts 11 nominations but faces off in one of the toughest categories of the night, for limited series, against ratings hit Chernobyl. \u201cThe international reception to Chernobyl took many industry insiders by surprise,\u201d nominated star Jared Harris said. \u201cMy hope is that its impact emboldens programmers to keep taking risks to not only delight, but also challenge their audiences.\u201d After a mixed reception for last year\u2019s hosts, Saturday Night Live duo Colin Jost and Michael Che, this year has followed on from many awards shows in the past year by going host-less. Producer Don Mischer has claimed the decision will allow the show, airing this year on Fox, to be \u201ca little more unpredictable\u201d. Presenters this year include Angela Bassett, Gwyneth Paltrow, Naomi Watts, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Viola Davis, Ben Stiller and the cast of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. \u201cIf you have a host and an opening, that\u2019s 15 or 20 minutes you can\u2018t have to salute the shows,\u201d Fox Entertainment\u2019s chief executive, Dan Collier, said. \u201cThis is a pretty unique year for some of America\u2019s favorite shows going away.\u201d The night is set to include on-stage cast reunions for both Game of Thrones and Veep. In recent years, the red carpet has been enlivened with political fashion statements and on Sunday, many stars are reported to be showing their support for the Memphis-based non-profit St Jude children\u2019s research hospital. Hollywood costume designer Arianne Phillips has created a gold pin which has been distributes to stars in attendance. Last year\u2019s biggest winners were Game of Thrones and the Amazon comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. The year also brought the ceremony\u2019s lowest ratings to date, down 11% from 2017.",

      "bodyText": "A palm-fringed ridge rises above the plains of Alagoas in north-east Brazil. Just a few replica thatched huts and a wall of wooden stakes now stand at its summit, but this was once the capital of the Quilombo dos Palmares \u2013 a sprawling, powerful nation of Africans who escaped slavery, and their descendants who held out here in the forest for 100 years. Its population was at least 11,000 \u2013 at the time, more than that of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 across dozens of villages with elected leaders and a hybrid language and culture. Palmares allied with indigenous peoples, traded for gunpowder, launched guerrilla raids on coastal sugar plantations to free other captives, and withstood more than 20 assaults before falling to Portuguese cannons in 1695. \u201cHundreds threw themselves to their deaths rather than surrender,\u201d said local guide Thais \u201cDandara\u201d Thaty at the historical site in Serra da Barriga. In her telling, those killed included Dandara \u2013 her adoptive namesake \u2013 captain of a band of warrior women, whose husband Zumbi is similarly shrouded in myth as a fearless Palmarian commander. About 5 million enslaved Africans were brought across the Atlantic to Brazil between 1501 and 1888. Many escaped, forming quilombos, or free communities. Three centuries later, the remarkable saga of Palmares is being seized on once more as a symbol of resistance against Brazil\u2019s rightwing president and the country\u2019s pervasive racism towards its black and mixed-race majority. A pair of new television and Netflix documentaries, screened in late 2018 and this June, have examined the legacy of Palmares. In March, the victorious carnival parade of Mangueira samba school highlighted Dandara among a lineup of overlooked black and indigenous heroes. Later that month, Brazil\u2019s senate voted to inscribe Dandara in the Book of Heroes in the Pantheon of the Fatherland, a soaring, modernist cenotaph in Bras\u00edlia. Angola Janga, a graphic novel charting the rise and fall of Palmares, has won a string of awards. \u201cMany people want an alternative view, to try to escape the one-sided, one-dimensional vision of our history imposed by the Portuguese and Brazilian elite,\u201d said author Marcelo D\u2019Salete, whose painstakingly researched book, including maps and timelines alongside striking monochrome illustrations, has been widely used in classrooms. \u201cQuilombos in general are very big right now,\u201d said Ana Carolina Louren\u00e7o, a sociologist and adviser to one recent documentary on Palmares. Young Afro-Brazilians have even coined a verb, she added \u2013 to quilombar \u2013 meaning to meet up to debate politics or simply celebrate black music, culture and identity. This renewed prominence coincides with a sharp rightward turn in Brazilian politics. Jair Bolsonaro has denied that Portuguese slavers set foot in Africa, and vilified the roughly 3,000 quilombos dotted across Brazil today \u2013 poor and marginalised Afro-Brazilian communities, often descended from fugitive slaves \u2013 branding their residents \u201cnot even fit for procreation\u201d. The president has sought to erode the landholding rights of quilombo communities in favour, critics argue, of the powerful agribusiness sector. Police killings, mainly of Afro-Brazilians, in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo have also risen sharply in 2019 with Bolsonaro\u2019s encouragement. Earlier this month, footage of supermarket security guards whipping a bound and gagged black teenager for allegedly shoplifting, prompted reflections on the lasting legacy of slavery. For centuries, writers portrayed Palmarians merely \u201cas runaway blacks and outlaws who rebelled against the crown\u201d, said the Alagoas historian Geraldo de Majella. It was only in the mid-20th century that historians began to reconstruct its story via Portuguese archives, often in Marxist terms. Meanwhile, \u201cblack militant movements took up the flag of Palmares as a movement of national liberation,\u201d De Majella explained. The largest guerrilla group during the 1964-85 military dictatorship \u2013 the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard \u2013 counted former president Dilma Rousseff among its members. Lula, the former president, simultaneously bolstered recognition of Palmares and the legal rights of present-day quilombos. 20 November \u2013 the date the Palmarian leader was killed \u2013 was officially adopted as the National Day of Zumbi and Black Consciousness in 2003. In the same year, public schools were legally required to teach Afro-Brazilian history.\ufeff But limited archaeological evidence and the absence of Palmarian sources has encouraged freewheeling interpretations. Today, perhaps drawing on the historical presence of advanced metalworking at the site, some compare Palmares with Wakanda, the hi-tech, Afrofuturist utopia of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther. But the inclusion of Dandara \u2013 whose first written mention occurs in a 1962 novel \u2013 in the Pantheon divided opinion. \u201cI absolutely defend creative freedom in the way people look at our history,\u201d said D\u2019Salete. \u201cBut we need to take care to differentiate between fact and fiction.\u201d Fernando Holiday, an Afro-Brazilian YouTuber and conservative activist, has noted that Palmarian society had monarchical elements and also kept captives. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint leftist and black leaders, but today we\u2019re commemorating a farce,\u201d Holiday said in a video. \u201cZumbi wasn\u2019t a hero of abolition.\u201d But Palmares and other examples of revolt and resistance, D\u2019Salete argued, \u201care important as other ways of understanding our history \u2026 so people can imagine and build another kind of society that is very different to one just based on violence and oppression\u201d. That legacy of violence is apparent in Tiningu, a remote quilombo in Par\u00e1 state. The community has battled to receive legal recognition, threatened by the ranchers and landowners who have cut down much of the surrounding rainforest. One resident was murdered by a rival soybean farmer on the eve of Bolsonaro\u2019s election. Here, Palmares is not merely history but a source of hope. \u201cZumbi was the beginning of everything,\u201d said local teacher Joanice Mata de Oliveira, whose school is daubed with the names of African nations. \u201cHe was the one who began our fight.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau is scrambling to halt further damage to his re-election campaign after a string of racist images from his past put Canada\u2019s image-conscious prime minister at the centre of yet another scandal. Less than five weeks before the federal election on 21 October, the Liberal leader\u2019s campaign was rocked when images emerged of Trudeau wearing blackface makeup. On Thursday, new video emerged of a third instance of Trudeau in blackface \u2013 just hours after he had apologized for wearing what he described as \u201cracist\u201d makeup to a costume party in 2001. The latest images came in a short, undated video clip published by Global News in which, Trudeau \u2013 his face, arms and legs painted black \u2013 waves at the camera and sticks his tongue out. The opposition Conservative party \u2013 currently neck-and-neck with Trudeau\u2019s Liberals \u2013 confirmed it had sent the video to Global News earlier in the week. Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup. \u201cI am wary of being definitive about this because of the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,\u201d he told reporters in Winnipeg. A spokesman for the prime minister said he had spent the morning calling Liberal candidates and community leaders to fully apologize for what he did \u201cknowing how racist and hurtful this type of thing was\u201d. The scandal erupted late on Wednesday, when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin \u2013 complete with dark skin makeup and a turban \u2013 at a 2001 function at a private school where he was then working as a 29-year-old teacher. Trudeau immediately apologized, and acknowledged that he had previously blacked up at a high school talent show, when he had sung Day-O, the traditional Jamaican song. \u201cI apologise profoundly,\u201d Trudeau told reporters aboard his campaign plane. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself. I\u2019m disappointed in myself,\u201d he said. Opposition politicians reacted swiftly, saying the decades-old images called into question Trudeau\u2019s judgment, his commitment to diversity \u2013 and his fitness to lead the country. \u201cHow do you look someone in the eye that has mocked the lived reality that I have lived \u2013 but, more importantly, what a lot of Canadians have lived,\u201d said Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party. The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s main opponent \u2013 said he was \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d and claimed the prime minister had \u201clied\u201d in his apology to Canadians. But Scheer has also faced calls in recent weeks to eject members from within his own party for racist or homophobic statements. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions \u2013 a standard he appeared unprepared to offer to Trudeau. The Green party leader, Elizabeth May, said she was \u201cdeeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau\u201d, saying the prime minister must commit to learning better social justice leadership at \u201call levels of government\u201d. Greg Fergus, a Liberal MP in Quebec and member of the federal Black Caucus, said he was \u201chopeful\u201d the incident could help spur \u201cnuanced\u201d conversations about systemic racism in Canada. \u201cI think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for diversity,\u201d Fergus said. \u201cWhat Justin Trudeau did was wrong. He has apologized. I know it is not representative of the man he is,\u201d Mitzie Hunter, a black member of Ontario\u2019s Liberal party, tweeted. \u201cThis is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.\u201d Others, were less forgiving of the prime minister\u2019s previous actions. \u201cThe privilege continues. There is no excuse for this. Apology is a first step. You should be aware of the history of #blackface and racism in this country and others. Apparently #diversityisourstrength? Deeply disappointed,\u201d tweeted former colleague Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who left the Liberal party in March 2019. After his landslide electoral victory in 2015, Trudeau was praised for his apparent commitment to diversity and inclusion, as well as polices which appeared to offer an explicit rebuke to those of Donald Trump: he quickly named a young and ethnically diverse cabinet and initially welcome large numbers of Syrian refugees. But he is fighting for his second parliamentary majority against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal: earlier this year Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law when he allegedly pressured his attorney general to halt the criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal is effectively locked in a dead heat with rival Conservatives in terms of the popular vote, but they hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament. It remains unclear how the images will affect the prime minister, whose political career has benefited as much from his carefully curated public persona as from his policies. When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn\u2019t entertain \u201chypotheticals\u201d and that each incident would be viewed on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d. Asked why he should stay on as leader, Trudeau responded: \u201cI\u2019m asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did.\u201d",

Social media forums such as LIHKG, a Reddit-like website, and encrypted apps such as Telegram have played a critical role in organising the leaderless protest movement but are now being used to share names, photos, phone numbers, ages and the occupation of individuals on both sides of the protest line. Supporters of the Hong Kong government have sought to identify masked protesters at demonstrations, while protesters themselves also appear to have taken part, sharing private information about police officers and their families across Telegram. One of the latest leaks this week saw a Chinese-language website with a Russian domain post information about journalists at local newspaper Apple Daily. It also has dozens of entries on protesters and other activists, similar to several pro-government telegram channels. Chris Yeung, chair of the Hong Kong Journalist Association, said the doxxing of journalists was an attack on press freedom and appeared to be part of a \u201cconcerted and apparently orchestrated campaign to undermine reporting of the protests in Hong Kong and to intimidate reporters\u201d. The leak, however, represents just a small proportion of doxxing cases, which have skyrocketed in the past three months. Hong Kong\u2019s privacy commission said it had received 1,376 complaints and 126 enquiries between 14 June and 18 September regarding personal information being leaked online, according to Stephen Kai-yi Wong, privacy commissioner for personal data. While journalists have become a high-profile target, about 40% of cases involve police officers while the rest concern government officials, community leaders, the families of police officers, and other citizens, Wong said.

The privacy commission has referred nearly 1,000 cases for criminal investigation and consideration for prosecution. Eight people were arrested in July for doxxing police officers, according to Hong Kong Free Press. Choy said doxxing of police began after officers stopped wearing badge numbers on their uniforms when they attended protests \u2013 leading protesters to attempt to identify officers independently as police tactics and arrests began to escalate. Telegram channels like Dadfindboy, with more than 136,000 subscribers, continue to share social media photos of Hong Kong police officers with other identifying information. Hong Kong police were criticised this week by Amnesty International for its excessive use of force at protests and during the arrest of anti-government protesters.",

In the world of late-night, Singh stands out: she\u2019s the first queer woman of color to host a network late-night show (Singh, the daughter of Indian immigrants to Canada, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lilly/status/1099837949951111168?lang=en\">came out publicly</a> as bisexual earlier this year), and the first YouTuber to land a network hosting gig.</p> <p>At 30, she\u2019s the youngest host on a late-night show on one of America\u2019s major networks, and the only woman (Samantha Bee\u2019s Full Frontal airs on cable channel TBS).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NppK_T_J8qc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NppK_T_J8qc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In other words, if anyone on late-night is going to rap about offering equal paid parental leave to staff, hiring a racially diverse team that\u2019s over 50% women (\u201cThis is the new standard \u2013 take notes, Hollywood!\u201d) and being interested in Sansa Stark and her brother, it\u2019s Singh, with the promise to \u201cthrow some melanin up in your late night\u201d.</p> <p>Although it airs late late-night at 1.35am, A Little Laterepresents an inflection point in entertainment: the ascent of a woman of color and the child of immigrants fluent in internet-speak to a platform notoriously resistant to change; and YouTube\u2019s arrival into one of network television\u2019s most hallowed and entrenched grounds. It\u2019s been a long time coming: at this point, YouTube celebrity can be more encompassing and global than traditional Hollywood celebrity, and Singh\u2019s popularity is undeniable. Since she first started posting videos, as a confused postgraduate living with her parents in suburban Ontario, Singh has cultivated a following of 15 million people, written a bestselling book (<a href=\"http://www.lillysinghbook.com/\">How </a><a href=\"http://www.lillysinghbook.com/\">to Be </a><a href=\"http://www.lillysinghbook.com/\">a Bawse</a>) interviewed Michelle Obama, and collaborated with her idol, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.</p> <p>Though YouTube celebrities often exist outside the traditional spheres of fame \u2013 not on magazine covers or in Hollywood films (\u201cYou may not know who I am, but I assure you that your kids do,\u201d Singh said in her NBC primetime special) \u2013 network late-night has increasingly relied on the site for relevance. As ratings have fallen, despite the \u201cTrump bump\u201d, hosts have moved toward moments built for viral potential \u2013 celebrity games, carpool karaoke or explosive political monologues that could blow up online. In 2019, YouTube and late-night TV feed a mutually beneficial loop; 7% of content on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18642833/youtube-trending-coffee-break-pewdiepie-late-night-sports-highlights\">the site\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d page</a> is dedicated to late-night, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18642833/youtube-trending-coffee-break-pewdiepie-late-night-sports-highlights\">a study on 18 months of data</a> cited by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20847627/lilly-singh-late-night-youtube-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers-nbc\">the Verge</a>, and the best videos from Fallon or Colbert can generate a couple of million views apiece.</p> <p>That positions Singh to capitalize on a younger, more online audience than those tuned into, say, Stephen Colbert. Already in her first week, Singh <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ocEw0wLwyM\">has indicated</a> that she\u2019s less concerned with finding viewers after 1am than reaching a global audience online. So far, her show has mostly stuck to what drew her an audience in the first place: self-deprecating, self-loving positive vibes, sketches and monologues playing on her ability to whip on and off dramatic facial expressions, genuinely earnest interviews, talk that steers clear of bait-y politics (\u201cI ain\u2019t talking bout Donald unless his last name is Glover,\u201d she rapped) while also speaking frankly from her perspective of a bisexual woman of color.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhKTcuk5Izc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yhKTcuk5Izc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In her first week, Singh has acknowledged that the narrative of difference is itself already a box. \u201cThe media has mentioned that I\u2019m a bisexual woman of color so much that I feel like I could just change my name,\u201d she joked in her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhKTcuk5Izc\">opening monologue.</a> And though she has avoided the circus of American politics, her first episodes have leaned unabashedly into the politics of her presence, speaking with a millennial frankness about race that comes straight from her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0Y6U08Fcn0\">\u201csay really ratchet things\u201d </a>days on YouTube.</p> <p>So far, there\u2019s been a segment on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ghi3z1uIU&amp;list=PLR5MZmqR0DQ0zUfpkhWBYaXaWjxBXGXcB&amp;index=3\">\u201cWhite Noise Machine</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ghi3z1uIU&amp;list=PLR5MZmqR0DQ0zUfpkhWBYaXaWjxBXGXcB&amp;index=3\">\u201d</a>, a gift delivered by the Office star Rainn Wilson that plays background noise such as Birkenstocks skirting the floor, craft beer being poured into a pre-chilled, imported stein, and brunch at a farm-to-table restaurant in Brooklyn. A biting digital short called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgMbYF00tNI\">\u201cWage Gap Workout\u201d</a> posits 80s-style grin-and-bear-it aerobics as the cure to entrenched workplace sexism. (What can you do about sexual harassment? \u201cAbsolutely nothing. Use a hashtag!\u201d)</p> <p>Singh\u2019s overall mood, though, is one of positive trailblazing, consistent with her internet persona. Guests so far have included Mindy Kaling and Tracee Ellis-Ross, who chat breezily through issues of racism in beauty products, dog videos, new motherhood and working the cellphone self-timer, often in the same bit.</p> <p>It\u2019s too soon to tell, of course, whether Singh\u2019s bridge between network late-night and playing the YouTube game will hold. She\u2019s aware of the stakes; no woman has ever made it past a single season of hosting a network late-night show. Michelle Wolf <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/28/michelle-wolf-the-break-netflix-late-night-comedy\">promised the same</a> political wariness for her Netflix show The Break, which was also cancelled after one season. One promising sign: on Thursday, NBC appointed a woman, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/09/nbc-katie-hockmeyer-head-late-night-programming-evp-1202738995/\">Katie Hockmeyer</a>, to oversee all of its late-night talkshows.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZuE0iqAN70\">Singh told PBS</a> the number of people chipping at the ceiling for so many years is \u201ca lot to think about\u201d. But \u201cregardless of what the outcome is, if I\u2019m being super candid with you, it\u2019s kind of not going to matter because it\u2019s going to help continue to pave that path. And that\u2019s what my priority is.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In March 2019, Lilly Singh, one of YouTube\u2019s biggest stars, appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon for a surprise announcement. \u201cYa girl,\u201d she said looking straight at the audience and emphasizing every word, \u201cis getting her own NBC late-night show!\u201d A Little Late With Lilly Singh would be, she said, \u201ckind of like my YouTube channel\u201d \u2013 the one with 15 million subscribers \u2013 \u201cbut, you know, now I have more than three staff members.\u201d Fallon\u2019s only advice for her was to \u201cjust be you\u201d. Six months later, Singh\u2019s show has arrived with \u201cya girl\u201d fully formed, one whose \u201cjust be you\u201d mantra differentiates her from Fallon or fellow NBC host Seth Meyers \u2013 or, for that matter, any other host on network television. \u201cHello my name is Lilly, and I ain\u2019t a white man / My skin\u2019s got some color and it ain\u2019t a spray tan,\u201d she rapped in the first segment of her premiere, a sketch in which she overturns an all-white and male writers\u2019 room while wearing a colorfully striped suit. In the world of late-night, Singh stands out: she\u2019s the first queer woman of color to host a network late-night show (Singh, the daughter of Indian immigrants to Canada, came out publicly as bisexual earlier this year), and the first YouTuber to land a network hosting gig. At 30, she\u2019s the youngest host on a late-night show on one of America\u2019s major networks, and the only woman (Samantha Bee\u2019s Full Frontal airs on cable channel TBS). In other words, if anyone on late-night is going to rap about offering equal paid parental leave to staff, hiring a racially diverse team that\u2019s over 50% women (\u201cThis is the new standard \u2013 take notes, Hollywood!\u201d) and being interested in Sansa Stark and her brother, it\u2019s Singh, with the promise to \u201cthrow some melanin up in your late night\u201d. Although it airs late late-night at 1.35am, A Little Laterepresents an inflection point in entertainment: the ascent of a woman of color and the child of immigrants fluent in internet-speak to a platform notoriously resistant to change; and YouTube\u2019s arrival into one of network television\u2019s most hallowed and entrenched grounds. It\u2019s been a long time coming: at this point, YouTube celebrity can be more encompassing and global than traditional Hollywood celebrity, and Singh\u2019s popularity is undeniable. Since she first started posting videos, as a confused postgraduate living with her parents in suburban Ontario, Singh has cultivated a following of 15 million people, written a bestselling book (How to Be a Bawse) interviewed Michelle Obama, and collaborated with her idol, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. Though YouTube celebrities often exist outside the traditional spheres of fame \u2013 not on magazine covers or in Hollywood films (\u201cYou may not know who I am, but I assure you that your kids do,\u201d Singh said in her NBC primetime special) \u2013 network late-night has increasingly relied on the site for relevance. As ratings have fallen, despite the \u201cTrump bump\u201d, hosts have moved toward moments built for viral potential \u2013 celebrity games, carpool karaoke or explosive political monologues that could blow up online. In 2019, YouTube and late-night TV feed a mutually beneficial loop; 7% of content on the site\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d page is dedicated to late-night, according to a study on 18 months of data cited by the Verge, and the best videos from Fallon or Colbert can generate a couple of million views apiece. That positions Singh to capitalize on a younger, more online audience than those tuned into, say, Stephen Colbert. Already in her first week, Singh has indicated that she\u2019s less concerned with finding viewers after 1am than reaching a global audience online. So far, her show has mostly stuck to what drew her an audience in the first place: self-deprecating, self-loving positive vibes, sketches and monologues playing on her ability to whip on and off dramatic facial expressions, genuinely earnest interviews, talk that steers clear of bait-y politics (\u201cI ain\u2019t talking bout Donald unless his last name is Glover,\u201d she rapped) while also speaking frankly from her perspective of a bisexual woman of color. In her first week, Singh has acknowledged that the narrative of difference is itself already a box. \u201cThe media has mentioned that I\u2019m a bisexual woman of color so much that I feel like I could just change my name,\u201d she joked in her opening monologue. And though she has avoided the circus of American politics, her first episodes have leaned unabashedly into the politics of her presence, speaking with a millennial frankness about race that comes straight from her \u201csay really ratchet things\u201d days on YouTube. So far, there\u2019s been a segment on the \u201cWhite Noise Machine\u201d, a gift delivered by the Office star Rainn Wilson that plays background noise such as Birkenstocks skirting the floor, craft beer being poured into a pre-chilled, imported stein, and brunch at a farm-to-table restaurant in Brooklyn. A biting digital short called \u201cWage Gap Workout\u201d posits 80s-style grin-and-bear-it aerobics as the cure to entrenched workplace sexism. (What can you do about sexual harassment? \u201cAbsolutely nothing. Use a hashtag!\u201d) Singh\u2019s overall mood, though, is one of positive trailblazing, consistent with her internet persona. Guests so far have included Mindy Kaling and Tracee Ellis-Ross, who chat breezily through issues of racism in beauty products, dog videos, new motherhood and working the cellphone self-timer, often in the same bit. It\u2019s too soon to tell, of course, whether Singh\u2019s bridge between network late-night and playing the YouTube game will hold. She\u2019s aware of the stakes; no woman has ever made it past a single season of hosting a network late-night show. Michelle Wolf promised the same political wariness for her Netflix show The Break, which was also cancelled after one season. One promising sign: on Thursday, NBC appointed a woman, Katie Hockmeyer, to oversee all of its late-night talkshows. Singh told PBS the number of people chipping at the ceiling for so many years is \u201ca lot to think about\u201d. But \u201cregardless of what the outcome is, if I\u2019m being super candid with you, it\u2019s kind of not going to matter because it\u2019s going to help continue to pave that path. And that\u2019s what my priority is.\u201d",

Before working at the Ministry of Agriculture he was at a regional directorate with a job promoting Normandy cheeses. Heritage industry, with its uneasy mix of artisanal and marketing cultures, its shady connection to nationalism, has been a fertile subject for Houellebecq in the past (it provides the inspired ending of <em>The Map and the Territory</em>) and it gets him going here, too. He understands bureaucracy, and has a gift for building high-stakes drama out of seemingly mind-numbing topics such as milk quotas and EU pasteurisation rules.</p> <p>At one point during his Normandy phase, Labrouste looks up an old college friend, Aymeric d\u2019Harcourt-Olonde, the scion of an ancient family, who is attempting to farm Normandy cattle on his ancestral lands using traditional methods. At this first reunion d\u2019Harcourt-Olonde is just about managing \u2013 kept afloat by protectionist milk quotas and (guiltily) selling off slices of land to Chinese buyers. But 15 years later the two men come together again, and this time d\u2019Harcourt-Olonde\u2019s dreams are falling apart. The quotas have been cut, the hand-milked herd is losing money, the chateau is crumbling around him, his wife is divorcing him, and he himself is sinking into squalor and bitterness, scraping by on the income from some shoddy bungalows while passing his time drinking, listening to 70s rock (you know things are bad when a man turns to Deep Purple for solace), and broodily polishing his guns.</p> <p>By this point the narrative has casually accumulated a number of other rural lives, all afflicted by the forces of free trade in one way or another, and as the two men reconverge, each with his different but complementary misery, an unexpectedly gripping story begins to crystallise. Suddenly the book\u2019s seemingly haphazard elements begin working together: the sexual and political impotence, the helpless yearning for the past, the degraded (and downgraded) masculinity, the aggrieved, incel-eye view of things, the foggy coastal landscape with its scavenger humans and seabirds, the sinister new interest in firearms, all coalescing into a vision of life among a portion of humanity who have found themselves \u2013 often to their indignant amazement \u2013 stuck on the wrong side in the zero sum game of globalised commerce. There is a horribly troubling scene of transactional paedophilia involving a visitor in one of the bungalows. I wish I could dismiss it as just another piece of cheap authorial vice-signalling, but the nastiness feels for once necessary: an integral part of the blighted reality <em>Serotonin</em> seeks to articulate.</p> <p>Houellebecq has been credited with foreseeing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\" title=\"\">gilets jaunes</a> movement with this novel, especially in the dramatic scenes of armed confrontation that bring this middle section to its unnerving climax. Deservedly so, I think, if only for his conjuring of the blackly pessimistic psychology that distinguishes these kinds of revolt from other, more high-minded uprisings. Does this redeem the crassness of those earlier scenes? Not really: crass is crass, even if it turns out to be strategic. And instead of sensibly ending on its high note, the book meanders on through a set of ridiculous plot twists in Labrouste\u2019s personal life, petering out on a note of morbid self-pity.</p> <p>And yet there it is. The agony and rage of the demoted, the discarded, the \u201cdeplorable\u201d (a segment of them, if not the whole basket), laid bare.

      "bodyText": "Taiwan has lost its second diplomatic ally in less than a week after the Pacific nation of Kiribati moved to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish foreign relations with China. The decision comes after the Solomon Islands announced it was breaking away from Taiwan on Monday, and means that in just a week the number of Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic allies has dropped from 17 to 15. Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister Joseph Wu announced on Friday that the country was cutting diplomatic ties with Kiribati and immediately closing its embassy in the country. In a statement, he said Taiwan \u201crejects and strongly condemns\u201d Kiribati for disregarding the long-standing relationship and aid provided by Taiwan and accused Kiribati\u2019s president Taneti Mamau of entertaining \u201chighly unrealistic expectations regarding China\u201d and requesting \u201cmassive financial assistance from Taiwan to purchase commercial airplanes\u201d, which Taiwan did not feel was consistent with its aid policy. Taiwan made the announcement before the Kiribati government formally announced its decision to cut ties with Taiwan in a pre-emptive move, as it did ahead of the Solomon Islands announcing their switch. The move will be a \u201csignificant blow\u201d to Taiwan, says Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute\u2019s Pacific Islands Program. Self-ruled Taiwan has lost seven allies since 2016 since the election of president, Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China. \u201cAnother one bites the dust in the Pacific,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a good week for Taiwan, losing two of your remaining 17 diplomatic allies in one week, and two with the largest populations in the Pacific.\u201d Taiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still views the island as its territory and has vowed to bring it under central control. Taiwan is self-ruled, but China considers it a wayward province and will not have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a state. Over the decades, dozens of countries, including the US and most western nations, have switched recognition to Beijing, leaving just a handful of countries loyal to Taiwan, largely in Latin America and the Pacific. The south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where, until this week, formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances. Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas), a country of 115,000 people in the south Pacific, was the largest of Taiwan\u2019s Pacific allies in terms of population after the Solomon Islands, a country of about 600,000 people, cut ties with the country earlier this week. Kiribati\u2019s decision leaves Taiwan with four remaining Pacific allies: Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau and Marshall Islands as well as allies in the Caribbean and Latin America. China\u2019s concerted attempt to peel allies away from Taipei could be seen putting pressure on Tsai, who is pro-Taiwanese sovereignty, ahead of the upcoming election in Taiwan in January. After the Solomon Islands cut ties with Taiwan, the US said it would consider cutting aid to the Solomon Islands in retribution. Gloria Steele, acting assistant administrator of USAID\u2019s Asia bureau, told a House budget hearing: \u201cWe are reassessing our assistance to the Solomon Islands at this point.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s interesting this is the hill the US has decided to die on in the Pacific,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cFor one, it\u2019s a pretty hypocritical position for them to be taking, considering they don\u2019t recognise Taiwan, they recognise China.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The two sides have starkly different visions of what the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol need to guarantee.</p> \n<p>The EU wants an arrangement that will secure frictionless trade on the island of Ireland to maintain the status quo, while the UK has sketched out a plan in which some checks on goods would be necessary, albeit facilitated by technology.</p> \n<p>Barclay described the EU approach as \u201cpurist\u201d in seeking \u201cto have no impact on the island of Ireland economy or north-south trade\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis could only be achieved through never leaving parts of the single market and customs union, for any checks would fall foul of an alternative that involves no checks at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a false test.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK is proposing Northern Ireland stays under EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/ireland-says-pms-agri-food-idea-not-enough-to-replace-backstop\">rules for agri-food </a>but that there would otherwise be two regulatory zones on the island of Ireland.</p> \n<p>Barclay said the appropriate time for fleshing out how technology and facilitated customs systems would work to ensure peace and the smooth running of the all-Ireland economy was during the standstill transition period up to the end of 2020, after the UK had formally left the EU.</p> \n<p>Barclay, who has not held talks in Brussels since July, said the EU needed to recognise the \u201cpolitical reality in the UK\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe alternative to the backstop is not necessary until the end of the implementation period, which is December 2020.</p> \n<p>\u201cIndeed this will be shaped by the future relationship, which is still to be determined. In short, why risk crystallising an undesirable result this November when both sides can work together until December 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Irish backstop proposed by the EU would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory until a future trade deal was negotiated that would avoid the need for border checks.</p> \n<p>Barclay said: \u201cThe EU risks continuing to insist on a test that the UK cannot meet and that the UK parliament has rejected three times.\u201d</p> \n<p>He insisted despite the Benn bill, which instructs the prime minister to seek and agree an extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU beyond 31 October if a deal is not agreed, that this was \u201cnot an option for this government\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Brexit secretary said the government would abide by the law but that \u201cwe will look at it closely and test exactly where we are\u201d.</p> \n<p> </p>",

Barclay described the EU approach as \u201cpurist\u201d in seeking \u201cto have no impact on the island of Ireland economy or north-south trade\u201d. \u201cThis could only be achieved through never leaving parts of the single market and customs union, for any checks would fall foul of an alternative that involves no checks at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a false test.\u201d The UK is proposing Northern Ireland stays under EU rules for agri-food but that there would otherwise be two regulatory zones on the island of Ireland. Barclay said the appropriate time for fleshing out how technology and facilitated customs systems would work to ensure peace and the smooth running of the all-Ireland economy was during the standstill transition period up to the end of 2020, after the UK had formally left the EU. Barclay, who has not held talks in Brussels since July, said the EU needed to recognise the \u201cpolitical reality in the UK\u201d. He said: \u201cThe alternative to the backstop is not necessary until the end of the implementation period, which is December 2020. \u201cIndeed this will be shaped by the future relationship, which is still to be determined. In short, why risk crystallising an undesirable result this November when both sides can work together until December 2020.\u201d The Irish backstop proposed by the EU would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory until a future trade deal was negotiated that would avoid the need for border checks. Barclay said: \u201cThe EU risks continuing to insist on a test that the UK cannot meet and that the UK parliament has rejected three times.\u201d He insisted despite the Benn bill, which instructs the prime minister to seek and agree an extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU beyond 31 October if a deal is not agreed, that this was \u201cnot an option for this government\u201d. The Brexit secretary said the government would abide by the law but that \u201cwe will look at it closely and test exactly where we are\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Looking back, the late 20th century looks like an enviably straightforward place to live. There\u2019s probably a touch of rose-tinted hindsight here, I suppose (imagine having to get around using only paper maps, and eating iceberg lettuce in every salad) but at least you knew where you were.</p> <p>Work, for instance. Work had a fixed geographical location and a time window. Work was desks and staplers and telephones and fountain pens. You had to spend all your time sitting still at the desk, so that the people at your work knew you were at work, and so that other people in their other workplaces could phone you, on the phone that didn\u2019t move from your desk. And so you knew what to wear. A pencil skirt and court shoes were perfect when your longest journey was walking to the kettle point and back. There was little pressure to \u201crefresh your work look\u201d when your office surroundings, from colleagues to pot plants, remained largely the same from year to year.</p> <p>If we are confused and discombobulated about what to wear to work in 2019, it is because we don\u2019t really know what work is supposed to look like any more. Freelancing, remote working, technology and office culture has fundamentally changed the way work looks and feels. Work is paper-free hotdesking and laptops in cafes and lunch al desko. Work is emails on your phone at bedtime and video meetings. It is office politics choreographed through social media rather than the watercooler. A pencil skirt does not work for walking meetings, nor is it your friend if you have to gather in \u201cbreak-out areas\u201d with low-level seating.</p> <p>And yet our iconography of workwear for women remains rooted in the 80s and 90s. It is Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street, and Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. It is stuck in the era when Tina Brown first ruled New York and Ally McBeal was an up-and-coming Boston lawyer. It is trouser suits and shoulder pads and handbags built to house a Filofax. None of which is appropriate any more, but we have nothing with which to replace it. The last major storyline in the narrative of what we wear to work was Dress Down Friday, which felt like progress, but was essentially just a shrug of tacit admission that no one has a clue what to put on any more.</p> <p>In many workplaces these days, anything goes. Which, of course, is the hardest dress code of them all, because it doesn\u2019t <em>actually</em> mean that anything goes, \u2013 it means a minefield of unspoken rules to be navigated. If you wear, say, a brightly coloured trouser suit instead of institutionalised black, will people think you have a creative and original mind, or will they think you are a fundamentally unserious person? Because those judgments matter, whether you like it or not. If you wear trainers with your trouser suit will your colleagues admire your fashion sense, or wonder if you forgot to change your shoes in the ladies? And so on and so forth. When you are standing in front of your wardrobe in the morning with the clock ticking down on the departure board in your head and these questions running through your mind, anything goes is not helpful at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"008dea0f7dddbb1924a5efeddec289a098e72093\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/008dea0f7dddbb1924a5efeddec289a098e72093/20_35_2530_1519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That was then (from left): Melanie Griffith in Working Girl; Calista Flockhart as Ally McBeal; journalist Tina Brown, 1993; Margaret Thatcher, 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That was then (from left): Melanie Griffith in Working Girl; Calista Flockhart as Ally McBeal; journalist Tina Brown, 1993; Margaret Thatcher, 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar; Rex/Shutterstock; Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So I\u2019m not here to tell you that you should wear whatever you feel comfortable in, because (a) it\u2019s not true and (b) it\u2019s not useful. We don\u2019t need rules, but we do need a plan. Right? Let\u2019s go to work.</p> <h2><strong>Stand tall in flat shoes</strong><br></h2> <p>High heels at work are a bit toxic these days, no? It goes without saying that no woman should be forced by her employer to wear high heels if she doesn\u2019t want to, and that it is utterly ludicrous that we are still having this debate; but here we are. Two years ago, the British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/21/high-heels-row-work-government-response-cop-out-nicola-thorp\" title=\"\">government rejected calls to outlaw mandatory high-heel policy</a>. Japan, where a heel policy is commonplace, is the latest battleground, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/06/japan-women-high-heels-workplace-kutoo-campaign\" title=\"\">with a vocal #KuToo campaign</a> \u2013 a pun on kutsu, meaning shoe, kutsuu, meaning pain, and #MeToo. Once you recognise how high heels have been weaponised against women in the workplace it\u2019s harder to see them in a purely benign light, as fun and empowering. I\u2019ve worn high heels for decades and I don\u2019t find them painful; but these days I wear flats most of the time, because heels can look a bit out of touch.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 you\u2019re not going to like this, but it\u2019s true \u2013 knee-length hemlines rarely work with flat shoes, and nor do floor-scraping trousers. Those silhouettes were built on a mannequin in heels. There are exceptions, obviously. If you are Stella Tennant you can wear a knee-length kilt and a brogue and look amazing, but on most of us norms it is not an elegant silhouette. Flat shoes work best with midi-length skirts, or with trousers that end at the ankle bone or a bit higher.</p> <p>A flat shoe shouldn\u2019t make you look unsophisticated, or as if you haven\u2019t made an effort. So instead of plain ballet pumps, go for loafers, or flat Mary Janes, or flat pumps with a narrow front V which gives them a little more gravitas. Trainers need to be spotless (most can be machine washed, on cold). Black tights with flat black shoes can look a bit school uniform, so if it\u2019s only your ankle showing, get some trainer-liner socks and show a few inches of skin instead.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t forget to breathe</strong><br></h2> <p>Many women equate dressing smartly with wearing tight-fitting clothes. Give a woman an intimidating meeting or presentation to dress for and her default will often be to vacuum-pack herself into a tight dress or suit. I suppose there are issues here about what women are valued for, stirred into a primal instinct of what to wear in order to hold an audience\u2019s attention. Anyway, I think it\u2019s worth recognising as a pitfall: if what you are wearing is so tight that the only male equivalent is midlife crisis cycling gear, then consider a rethink.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is something about a defined, clear silhouette that projects a crispness and clarity that feels right at work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am not suggesting we waft around the office in kaftans. (I love kaftans with a passion and plan to spend my entire dotage in them; but they are not workwear.) There is certainly something about a defined, clear silhouette that projects a crispness and clarity that feels right at work \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t have to be a newsreader-esque hourglass dress. I am very into the trouser shape I\u2019m calling a Mom-trouser: high-waisted, with a buttoned waistband and wide or tapered (but not sausage tight) legs. This works really well with a shirt or blouse tucked in. A loose or pleated midi skirt becomes very purposeful-looking if you wear it with a structured blazer.</p> <h2><strong>Make print and colour your friends</strong><br></h2> <p>You can be taken seriously without being a joyless automaton. Looking too officey is very ageing, when younger people in the workplace tend to dress more casually. And anyway, we spend a lot of time working, and what you wear is one way to alter the mood of your day. Print and colour are your friends. This time of year, before we get mired in the practicalities of freezing temperatures and wet pavements, is a good time to bring some fun to what you wear. Now, while our getting-dressed time slot still happens in daylight in a civilised fashion, before darkness descends and we are groping inside wardrobes in the pitch black, is the moment to experiment. When you look at outfits in fashion shoots and ad campaigns, don\u2019t look at the price in the credits; stare at the outfit and think about what you\u2019ve already got in your wardrobe that has a similar vibe. It might be the same silhouette in a different print, or vice versa \u2013 but if you get an idea, then try it out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Florals on black backgrounds are to autumn what leopard-print skirts are to summer, which is, everywhere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are lots of ways you can add fun to what you wear to work. Colour is fun. Leopard print is possibly a bit too fun for some workplaces, but stripes are great. Florals can be very work-friendly on black backgrounds, and florals on black backgrounds are to autumn what leopard-print skirts are to summer, in the modern fashion calendar, which is, everywhere. Jumpsuits and boilersuits put a spring in your step, mentally as well as physically \u2013 something about the mobility of a jumpsuit makes it seem like an upbeat thing to wear.</p> <h2><strong>Pick your trends with care</strong><br></h2> <p>Not all fashion is created equal, when it comes to workwear. Fashion this autumn, for instance, includes many trends, some of which are well suited to wearing to the office (70s bourgeois is a slam dunk, being both smart and slick but also fashiony), and others which are perhaps less so. Feathers, for instance.

      "bodyText": "Looking back, the late 20th century looks like an enviably straightforward place to live. There\u2019s probably a touch of rose-tinted hindsight here, I suppose (imagine having to get around using only paper maps, and eating iceberg lettuce in every salad) but at least you knew where you were. Work, for instance. Work had a fixed geographical location and a time window. Work was desks and staplers and telephones and fountain pens. You had to spend all your time sitting still at the desk, so that the people at your work knew you were at work, and so that other people in their other workplaces could phone you, on the phone that didn\u2019t move from your desk. And so you knew what to wear. A pencil skirt and court shoes were perfect when your longest journey was walking to the kettle point and back. There was little pressure to \u201crefresh your work look\u201d when your office surroundings, from colleagues to pot plants, remained largely the same from year to year. If we are confused and discombobulated about what to wear to work in 2019, it is because we don\u2019t really know what work is supposed to look like any more. Freelancing, remote working, technology and office culture has fundamentally changed the way work looks and feels. Work is paper-free hotdesking and laptops in cafes and lunch al desko. Work is emails on your phone at bedtime and video meetings. It is office politics choreographed through social media rather than the watercooler. A pencil skirt does not work for walking meetings, nor is it your friend if you have to gather in \u201cbreak-out areas\u201d with low-level seating. And yet our iconography of workwear for women remains rooted in the 80s and 90s. It is Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street, and Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. It is stuck in the era when Tina Brown first ruled New York and Ally McBeal was an up-and-coming Boston lawyer. It is trouser suits and shoulder pads and handbags built to house a Filofax. None of which is appropriate any more, but we have nothing with which to replace it. The last major storyline in the narrative of what we wear to work was Dress Down Friday, which felt like progress, but was essentially just a shrug of tacit admission that no one has a clue what to put on any more. In many workplaces these days, anything goes. Which, of course, is the hardest dress code of them all, because it doesn\u2019t actually mean that anything goes, \u2013 it means a minefield of unspoken rules to be navigated. If you wear, say, a brightly coloured trouser suit instead of institutionalised black, will people think you have a creative and original mind, or will they think you are a fundamentally unserious person? Because those judgments matter, whether you like it or not. If you wear trainers with your trouser suit will your colleagues admire your fashion sense, or wonder if you forgot to change your shoes in the ladies? And so on and so forth. When you are standing in front of your wardrobe in the morning with the clock ticking down on the departure board in your head and these questions running through your mind, anything goes is not helpful at all. So I\u2019m not here to tell you that you should wear whatever you feel comfortable in, because (a) it\u2019s not true and (b) it\u2019s not useful. We don\u2019t need rules, but we do need a plan. Right? Let\u2019s go to work. Stand tall in flat shoes High heels at work are a bit toxic these days, no? It goes without saying that no woman should be forced by her employer to wear high heels if she doesn\u2019t want to, and that it is utterly ludicrous that we are still having this debate; but here we are. Two years ago, the British government rejected calls to outlaw mandatory high-heel policy. Japan, where a heel policy is commonplace, is the latest battleground, with a vocal #KuToo campaign \u2013 a pun on kutsu, meaning shoe, kutsuu, meaning pain, and #MeToo. Once you recognise how high heels have been weaponised against women in the workplace it\u2019s harder to see them in a purely benign light, as fun and empowering. I\u2019ve worn high heels for decades and I don\u2019t find them painful; but these days I wear flats most of the time, because heels can look a bit out of touch. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 you\u2019re not going to like this, but it\u2019s true \u2013 knee-length hemlines rarely work with flat shoes, and nor do floor-scraping trousers. Those silhouettes were built on a mannequin in heels. There are exceptions, obviously. If you are Stella Tennant you can wear a knee-length kilt and a brogue and look amazing, but on most of us norms it is not an elegant silhouette. Flat shoes work best with midi-length skirts, or with trousers that end at the ankle bone or a bit higher. A flat shoe shouldn\u2019t make you look unsophisticated, or as if you haven\u2019t made an effort. So instead of plain ballet pumps, go for loafers, or flat Mary Janes, or flat pumps with a narrow front V which gives them a little more gravitas. Trainers need to be spotless (most can be machine washed, on cold). Black tights with flat black shoes can look a bit school uniform, so if it\u2019s only your ankle showing, get some trainer-liner socks and show a few inches of skin instead. Don\u2019t forget to breathe Many women equate dressing smartly with wearing tight-fitting clothes. Give a woman an intimidating meeting or presentation to dress for and her default will often be to vacuum-pack herself into a tight dress or suit. I suppose there are issues here about what women are valued for, stirred into a primal instinct of what to wear in order to hold an audience\u2019s attention. Anyway, I think it\u2019s worth recognising as a pitfall: if what you are wearing is so tight that the only male equivalent is midlife crisis cycling gear, then consider a rethink. I am not suggesting we waft around the office in kaftans. (I love kaftans with a passion and plan to spend my entire dotage in them; but they are not workwear.) There is certainly something about a defined, clear silhouette that projects a crispness and clarity that feels right at work \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t have to be a newsreader-esque hourglass dress. I am very into the trouser shape I\u2019m calling a Mom-trouser: high-waisted, with a buttoned waistband and wide or tapered (but not sausage tight) legs. This works really well with a shirt or blouse tucked in. A loose or pleated midi skirt becomes very purposeful-looking if you wear it with a structured blazer. Make print and colour your friends You can be taken seriously without being a joyless automaton. Looking too officey is very ageing, when younger people in the workplace tend to dress more casually. And anyway, we spend a lot of time working, and what you wear is one way to alter the mood of your day. Print and colour are your friends. This time of year, before we get mired in the practicalities of freezing temperatures and wet pavements, is a good time to bring some fun to what you wear. Now, while our getting-dressed time slot still happens in daylight in a civilised fashion, before darkness descends and we are groping inside wardrobes in the pitch black, is the moment to experiment. When you look at outfits in fashion shoots and ad campaigns, don\u2019t look at the price in the credits; stare at the outfit and think about what you\u2019ve already got in your wardrobe that has a similar vibe. It might be the same silhouette in a different print, or vice versa \u2013 but if you get an idea, then try it out. There are lots of ways you can add fun to what you wear to work. Colour is fun. Leopard print is possibly a bit too fun for some workplaces, but stripes are great. Florals can be very work-friendly on black backgrounds, and florals on black backgrounds are to autumn what leopard-print skirts are to summer, in the modern fashion calendar, which is, everywhere. Jumpsuits and boilersuits put a spring in your step, mentally as well as physically \u2013 something about the mobility of a jumpsuit makes it seem like an upbeat thing to wear. Pick your trends with care Not all fashion is created equal, when it comes to workwear. Fashion this autumn, for instance, includes many trends, some of which are well suited to wearing to the office (70s bourgeois is a slam dunk, being both smart and slick but also fashiony), and others which are perhaps less so. Feathers, for instance. Bucket hats. \u201cUgly sister\u201d shoulders. Microbags. Trends that will work this season include shirtdresses: try them over knee-length or ankle-length boots, or layered over a polo neck, if they feel too summery otherwise. Also, try a blazer with a belt over the top; I am very much feeling this as an intermediary level before the time comes to wear an actual coat. Make an entrance, make an exit I\u2019m talking about your coat, and your tote bag. The image in your head of what you wear to work is the clothes you are wearing once you have taken off your coat and hung it up along with the bag with your snacks, your gym clothes, the returns parcel you\u2019ve got to drop off at lunchtime.

Its index comparing work-life balance in different cities found Tokyo residents worked an average of 42 hours a week and had the earliest start time of all cities at 8:57am. But despite being notorious for long working hours, cities in Japan have relatively low productivity levels. According to the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_LV\">latest OECD data</a> on productivity, which is calculated by dividing GDP per capita by the number of hours worked, Japan is the least productive country in the G7; the US is roughly 59% more productive.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an <a href=\"https://www.ubs.com/microsites/prices-earnings/en/explore/?category=Earnings&amp;indicator=Earnings_Working%20hours%20and%20vacation%20days%20(average)_Work%20per%20year%20(hours)&amp;split=false\">annual report by the Swiss bank UBS</a> looking at the number of hours worked in different cities found Mumbai, India\u2019s largest city, to be the world\u2019s hardest-working city, clocking up the longest average working hours of 3,315 per year per worker. At the other end of the scale was Lagos, where the average worker clocked up 609 hours per year.

According to the UBS study, Mexico City is the world\u2019s third-hardest working city, with the average worker clocking up 2,622 hours per year. However, Mexico is the least productive of 38 countries listed in data from OECD \u2014 managing $18.8 (\u00a315) in GDP for every hour worked. Ireland, the most productive, creates $84 in GDP for every hour. And with an annual average of 1,856 hours, workers in Ireland\u2019s capital, Dublin, work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts in Mexico City.</p> <p>But despite evidence to suggest working less hours can have a positive impact on productivity levels, overwork continues to plague many cities. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development surveyed 5,136 people as part of its <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/uk-working-lives-2019-v1_tcm18-58585.pdf\">2019 UK Working Lives Study</a>, and found that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/work-life-balance-overtime-hours-stress-pressure-mental-health-a8954996.html\">one in four workers overwork by at least 10 hours per week</a>. The study also revealed that one in three workers say they have too much work to complete in their job and one in five do not have the time to do their job in their allocated hours.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers are often resistant to the overwhelming evidence that long working hours do not equate to good performance,\u201d says Prof Gail Kinman, an occupational health psychologist from the University of Bedfordshire. \u201cIn fact, the opposite is true. The longer people work, the poorer their performance will be, resulting in poor concentration and memory, compromised problem-solving and creativity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe4cf252adf6a9426dab074f4684eca3646d59d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe4cf252adf6a9426dab074f4684eca3646d59d/0_76_5456_3273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stressed businessman at the office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Studies have shown that longer working hours do not necessarily equal good performance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tero Vesalainen/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kinman also warns that chronic, long working hours can have a major impact on mental and physical health because people\u2019s resources are drained and not adequately replenished by rest.</p> <p>With job opportunities a common pull factor for people moving to urban areas, the problem of overwork can be particularly acute in cities.

But despite evidence to suggest working less hours can have a positive impact on productivity levels, overwork continues to plague many cities. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development surveyed 5,136 people as part of its 2019 UK Working Lives Study, and found that one in four workers overwork by at least 10 hours per week. The study also revealed that one in three workers say they have too much work to complete in their job and one in five do not have the time to do their job in their allocated hours. \u201cEmployers are often resistant to the overwhelming evidence that long working hours do not equate to good performance,\u201d says Prof Gail Kinman, an occupational health psychologist from the University of Bedfordshire. \u201cIn fact, the opposite is true. The longer people work, the poorer their performance will be, resulting in poor concentration and memory, compromised problem-solving and creativity.\u201d Kinman also warns that chronic, long working hours can have a major impact on mental and physical health because people\u2019s resources are drained and not adequately replenished by rest. With job opportunities a common pull factor for people moving to urban areas, the problem of overwork can be particularly acute in cities. How can a better work-life balance be established? According to the Kisi study, Singapore has the highest percentage of people working more than 48 hours a week. \u201cSingapore is overall thought to be a very liveable city, but the analysis showed that citizens have one of the highest stress scores,\u201d says Bernhard Mehl, the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cAfter publishing this study we\u2019ve had cities calling us to understand what they can do better, and it\u2019s really about comparing yourself to the average to see where your deficits are that could drive a change-focused agenda.\u201d In the case of Singapore, Mehl suggests that \u201coffering more programmes around mental health and shaping the conversation around stress relief might be a good idea\u201d. In more broad terms, Kinman says it is critical to set boundaries. \u201cSwitching off from work (physically and mentally) is essential to ensure mental and physical health and a happy and fulfilling personal life,\u201d she says. \u201cPlan holidays and short breaks through the year in advance; use mindfulness to help you switch off; practice self-compassion and prioritise self-care.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

I don\u2019t want that to be taken away by climate change.\u201d Students in Boston will also be excused school, with a crowd of 10,000 expected to assemble. \u201cWe are excited to disrupt business as usual, to demand a Green New Deal,\u201d Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old organizer in Boston, in reference to the resolution put forward by progressive Democrats to enact a second world war-style economic mobilization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A parallel protest will take part in New York, highlighting the impact of the climate crisis on people of colour and to mark the second anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico. In Seattle, more than 1,500 Amazon employees will strike over the company\u2019s climate policies. The strikes have been backed by several cities. \u201cWhen your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm,\u201d read a joint statement by the mayors of New York, Paris and Los Angeles. \u201cYoung people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity, are doing just that.\u201d The sprawling strikes represent a remarkable escalation of Thunberg\u2019s decision last year to start skipping school on Fridays to protest against inaction by the Swedish government over the climate crisis. A global movement has since grown from the 16-year-old\u2019s stand, and young people have expressed outrage that their generation is being left a world with increasingly punishing heatwaves, storms, flooding and societal unrest. Thunberg, who has abjured plane travel, arrived in New York on a solar-powered racing yacht last month and has since become a focal point for the climate movement, appearing on talkshows and in Congress to excoriate its members. She has also met Barack Obama, who called her \u201cone of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates\u201d. Her US sojourn will culminate with the UN climate summit, to be held in New York on Monday. She will address world leaders who have assembled to help revive the flagging international effort to avoid disastrous global heating. The US and Brazil, led by nationalist leaders disdainful of climate science, have slowed momentum, with a UN report last week warning that the required ambition is lacking among most countries. \u201cThe audacity of kids simply asking leaders to lead is extraordinary. We are indebted to them,\u201d said Rachel Kyte, special representative for the UN secretary general for sustainable energy. \u201cThey are rightly impatient. \u201cNot every country is aligned to the need for fast action. The hope is that the US will join in at the point where public opinion is able to influence the national voice more than it does today.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the video that Chicago police released to calm outrage over another killing of a black man by a white police officer, Harith Augustus appears to be unholstering a gun as he\u2019s shot dead in the street. But a new art exhibit by the Invisibility Institute and Forensic Architecture, unveiled as part of the Chicago Architecture Biennial, reveals a more complex case, uncovering what appear to be a number of missteps by police and challenging the official narrative of the 2018 shooting. It is a seemingly unlikely medium for seeking social justice, but one that might become more common. \u201cI hope this project demonstrates how much can be learned if the right quality attention and tools are brought to bear on these cases,\u201d said Jamie Kalven, a journalist and the founder of the not-for-profit Invisibility Institute. Augustus was a barber with a legal firearm who was detained by police in 2018 as he apparently ran errands in his predominantly black South Shore Chicago neighborhood. While Quincy Jones, a black officer said to be trusted within the community, talked with Augustus, two white officers lunged at Augustus\u2019s hands. He pulled back, stumbled between two cars and was shot dead by an officer as he appeared to run away. Police said he was reaching for his gun. A video released by the Chicago police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, after significant protest in the neighborhood, freeze-framed on his holstered weapon. \u201cThe video speaks for itself,\u201d he said in a news conference at the time. The city-released videos tell a story favorable to police, the project\u2019s investigators say. \u201cThe narrative starts to form the moment the body hits the ground,\u201d said Kalven, whose reporting helped bring the Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke to justice for the killing of teenager Laquan McDonald. \u201cWhat we\u2019re arguing is that you have to consider the totality of the circumstances.\u201d The exhibit tells a different story. In a series of short, documentary-style films, researchers combine raw footage from the scene of the incident with on the ground reporting and 3-D modeling to more deeply examine the way the incident unfolded. The videos, which deconstruct the shooting in granular detail, suggest breaches in protocol by individual officers at the scene and by the Chicago police department, which Kalven alleges improperly withheld a dash-cam video from an earlier Freedom of Information Act request. Dash-cam video, which is included in the exhibit, shows the shooting from a different angle than the widely seen footage from officer Dillan Halley\u2019s body camera \u2013 and raises questions about the police narrative that the shooting was \u201ctextbook legitimate\u201d. \u201cOne perspective is not enough,\u201d said Christina Varvia, the deputy director of Forensic Architecture. \u201cBeing able to change perspective is a really powerful thing.\u201d Body cameras have been presented as an important tool for police accountability in the wake of high-profile shootings of black Americans by police officers, but, as Kalven and Varvia note, they are also \u201cnarrative devices\u201d, depicting the event in question from the point of view of the police officer. In one of the most powerful videos, which are available online, the investigators use computer simulation to present the incident from Augustus\u2019s viewpoint \u2013 depicting, through computer animation, how Halley raising his gun could have appeared to Augustus and the view of 71st Street as he lay on the ground after being shot. The video investigations also examine the broader context of the killing \u2013 including the demonstrations that followed in which police clashed with protesters. Kahari Blackburn, a film-maker at Invisible Institute, had been at those demonstrations following the killing. \u201cIt felt like chaos,\u201d said Blackburn, who worked on the project. The careful, detailed interrogation of the official narrative could be a blueprint for activists, investigators, and even government and law enforcement agencies to analyze similar cases, its creator say. \u201cWe want people to be able to do similar work,\u201d said Varvia. Investigators also hope the exhibit \u2013 which will be hosted at the Invisibility Institute\u2019s office on Chicago\u2019s South Side, in the shadow of University of Chicago and not far from where Augustus was killed \u2013 will challenge the narrative of \u201csplit second\u201d decisions that is frequently used to justify police shootings. \u201cWe care above all about justice for Harith Augustus and some kind of comfort for his family,\u201d Kalven said.",

It has been revamped in a modern, relaxed style, but its USP is unchanged: the fabulous clifftop setting.

We turned right, heading north for a two-hour stroll along the cliffs. We passed a monument to Marconi, who sent the first transatlantic wireless signal from here in 1901 (he stayed at the Polurrian), then headed to uncrowded <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/poldhu-cove\" title=\"\">Poldhu Cove</a>, a sandy beach with a surf school and cafe. Further on, at Church Cove, another quiet sandy beach, we called in at medieval St Winwaloe\u2019s \u2013 the \u201cchurch of the storms\u201d \u2013 tucked behind the dunes. From here, the path climbs again towards <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/gunwalloe\" title=\"\">Gunwalloe</a> village and our walk\u2019s end, the 15th-century <a href=\"http://halzephron-inn.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Halzephron Inn</a>. This well-known pub was packed with tourists and locals, so we headed back to sleepier Mullion for dinner (by taxi as it had started to pour with rain). We ate homemade steak and ale pie at the thatched <a href=\"http://www.oldinnmullion.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Old Inn</a>; the best table is in the huge inglenook fireplace.</p> <p>The next day, we set off on a driving tour of the Lizard\u2019s highlights (many of them can also be reached on the <a href=\"https://www.firstgroup.com/cornwall/routes-and-maps/network-maps\" title=\"\">L1 and L2 bus routes</a>). The roads are narrow and winding, but we were untroubled by traffic jams \u2013 the only holdups were caused by the odd tractor. Our first port of call was the <a href=\"https://sealsanctuary.sealifetrust.org/en/\" title=\"\">Cornish Seal Sanctuary</a> in Gweek, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases about 70 seal pups a year.

Our final stop was Cadgwith, a picture-postcard fishing hamlet with a shingle beach, brightly painted boats and thatched cottages. We sampled the Curio gin \u2013 distilled in Mullion and flavoured with foraged rock samphire \u2013 at the <a href=\"https://www.cadgwithcoveinn.com/en-GB\" title=\"\">Cadgwith Cove Inn</a>, an old smugglers\u2019 haunt where the <a href=\"https://www.falmouthseashanty.co.uk/groups/cadgwith-singers\" title=\"\">Cadgwith Singers</a> still perform sea shanties every Friday night.</p> <p>Dinner was at the hotel, in a glorious sunset. \u201cCornish tapas\u201d starters (three for \u00a315) included potted crab, and while the fish stew (\u00a314) was underwhelming, the shellfish platter (\u00a326) more than made up for it: a pile of crab claws, scallops, prawns and mussels, all caramelised in the wood-fired oven.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48f21e34360b35366b61161c18cb33957733a589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48f21e34360b35366b61161c18cb33957733a589/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shell out \u2026 a seafood platter at the Polurrian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shell out \u2026 a seafood platter at the Polurrian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LEE SEARLE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, gym, treatment rooms (I had a deep-tissue massage, \u00a335 for 30 minutes) and weekly yoga classes. It can also organise wild swimming sessions and surf lessons, or sea kayaking, paddleboarding and coasteering with <a href=\"https://www.lizardadventure.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lizard Adventure</a>. We stayed on dry land and ventured out on our second coastal walk. A left turn out of the hotel took us down to <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/mullion-cove\" title=\"\">Mullion Cove</a> and its tiny harbour. After a steepish climb up the other side, the path mainly hugs the clifftops, with a few dips down to beaches and inlets. The cliffs were carpeted in Cornish heath (pale purple heather), campion, hairy greenweed and wild orchids, and buzzing with bees and comma butterflies. We kept a keen eye out for the red-billed, red-legged Cornish chough, which were spotted in Cornwall in 2001 for the first time since the 1970s, but weren\u2019t lucky enough to spot one. We did, however, stop to watch two young peregrines practise their flying skills, play-fighting and dive-bombing unimpressed gulls.</p> <p>One of the main draws on this stretch of coastline is <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/kynance-cove\" title=\"\">Kynance Cove</a>. Our first glimpse of it from the cliffs was breathtaking: white sand, turquoise sea and serpentine rock stacks. But closer up, we had a taste of the overcrowding that plagues other parts of the county \u2013 the beach was packed. Still, we found a patch of sand and swam in the deliciously cool, clear water. It would be far better visited out of season and at low tide, though, when the caves and islands can be explored. September is perfect, as it is still warm enough to swim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41fee1f86070f097ef477b1fd72d2c94d9c0c093\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41fee1f86070f097ef477b1fd72d2c94d9c0c093/0_0_4819_2892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polpeor Cove and the path towards Lizard Point.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polpeor Cove and the path towards Lizard Point.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lizard-point\" title=\"\">Lizard Point</a>, as far south as you can go in mainland Britain, is two miles further on. With less than a mile to go, we noticed something in the sea: a seal! We watched as six heads appeared, and the occasional lazily rolling body. The sanctuary was great, but nothing compares to seeing animals in the wild.</p> <p>On reaching Lizard Point, we couldn\u2019t resist a Cornish pasty in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Restaurant/Polpeor-Cafe-293064304147303/\" title=\"\">Polpeor Cafe</a>, \u201cBritain\u2019s most southerly cafe\u201d \u2013 even if it was twice the price of one in nearby Lizard village. Visitors can climb Lizard Lighthouse, built in 1751, though not, strangely, on Fridays or Saturdays (adult \u00a38.50, child \u00a35.50, <a href=\"https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouse-visitor-centres/lizard-lighthouse-visitor-centre\" title=\"\">trinityhouse.co.uk</a>). We were tired after our four-hour walk, but thankfully there is a bus back to Mullion from Lizard village.</p> <p>Next we headed up the coast to Porthleven, a delightful fishing port near Helston, the only town on the Lizard. (Helston has seen better days, but is well worth stopping for a Spingo ale at the <a href=\"http://www.spingoales.com/index.html\" title=\"\">Blue Anchor Inn</a>, where it has been brewed for 600 years.) Porthleven is a lively little place, but with a fraction of the crowds that flock to St Ives or Padstow. Like Padstow, it is a foodie destination, with several good places to eat, such as the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/The-Mussel-Shoal-374092983464353/\" title=\"\">Mussel Shoal</a>, a laid-back new spot on the harbour head serving moules-frites, squid and chowder. There\u2019s also a handful of pubs, including the 17th-century <a href=\"https://theshipinnporthleven.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ship Inn</a>; and a <a href=\"http://www.porthlevenfoodfestival.com/\" title=\"\">food festival</a> each April.

The vast majority believe governments and health bodies are failing to prepare adequately for the medical impacts of global heating.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Brexit </strong>\u2013 Labour kicks off its annual conference tomorrow with a row over Brexit brewing, as party activists vow to force a vote on it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/labour-activists-to-push-for-party-to-campaign-for-remain\">becoming a clear party of remain</a>, regardless of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal stance. Corbyn has repeatedly declined to say which side he would campaign on, if any, at a potential second referendum, after pledging that as prime minister he would negotiate a better Brexit deal and put that to a public vote alongside the option of remain. The conference will take place in the shadow of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/judges-urged-to-back-mps-recall-if-they-rule-against-prorogation\"> expected supreme court decision</a> \u2013 promised by the president of the court for early next week \u2013 on the legality parliament being prorogued. The final arguments in the court yesterday afternoon hinged on who has the power to bring parliament back. In his closing submissions, Lord Pannick QC, representing the legal campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, said that if the supreme court found that Johnson had acted unlawfully but he declined to end the suspension of parliament then \u201cin those circumstances we believe it would be open to the Speaker and Lord Speaker to reassemble parliament \u2026 as soon as possible next week\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump whistleblower </strong>\u2013 Reports that the president made worrying promises to a foreign leader gathered momentum overnight as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/18/trump-foreign-leader-promise-whistleblower\">offered conflicting answers to questions</a> on whether he (Giuliani) had asked Ukraine to investigate the former vice-president, and 2020 presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. At one point Guiliani, in an interview on CNN, dismissed the claim as ridiculous before admitting it and saying he was proud of it. The reports of Trump\u2019s alleged promises so troubled a US intelligence official that it prompted a whistleblower complaint. The intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, determined that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d, a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Shameful rise\u2019 </strong>\u2013 The number of children leaving school without basic qualifications by the age of 18 has risen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/20/shameful-rise-18-of-children-leave-school-without-basic-qualifications\">nearly a quarter in the past three years</a>, according to a report by the children\u2019s commissioner for England. Almost one in five children (18%) left school last year without the government benchmark of five good GCSEs, or the equivalent technical qualifications. The figures for children with special educational needs are particularly stark with almost half (45%) failing to reach what is known as level 2 attainment by the time they finish compulsory education. Pupils on free school meals (FSM) also fared badly with more than one in three (37%) leaving school \u201cwithout any substantive qualifications\u201d. The children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Longfield, described the figures as shameful and called on the government to urgently investigate</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Reporting rape </strong>\u2013 Thousands of allegations have been inaccurately recorded by the police over the past three years and in some cases never appeared in official figures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/19/thousands-of-reports-inaccurately-recorded-by-police\">the Guardian has revealed</a>. A review of audits of 34 police forces published between August 2016 and July 2019 showed only three of them were found to have accurately recorded complaints of rape. Of the more than 4,900 audited rape reports, 552 were found to be inaccurate. Complainants with mental health and addiction issues and victims of trafficking were particularly vulnerable to being struck from the record by a number of police forces.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Hobbit insect</strong> \u2013 New Zealand researchers have named an insect after JRR Tolkien\u2019s famous character Frodo Baggins. The insect is smaller than its relations and is found in the country\u2019s South Island, where The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit were filmed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/20/new-zealand-insect-named-after-hobbit-frodo-baggins-from-lord-of-the-rings-psylla-frodobaggins\">The </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/20/new-zealand-insect-named-after-hobbit-frodo-baggins-from-lord-of-the-rings-psylla-frodobaggins\">psylla frodobagginsi</a></em> was identified during PhD reserach into psyllid insects. Measuring just 1.24mm, it is most easily identified by \u201cits small dimension, light colours, and uniformly spotted wings\u201d. </p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Where did it all go wrong for David Cameron?</h2> \n<p>As the former PM publishes his memoirs, Patrick Wintour tells Anushka Asthana that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/20/where-did-it-all-go-wrong-for-david-cameron\">Cameron\u2019s pursuit of austerity and decision to call an EU referendum sowed the seeds of his demise</a>.

Women have been dominating outdoor endurance swimming for some time, and a combination of obvious and not-so-obvious factors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/woman-first-swim-channel-sarah-thomas-wild-swimming\">shows that the average Channel crossing time for women is faster than that for men.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76fad964-5dae-426b-ad22-16b4b2c80ad3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Khe3cPVzYaA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In general, women have a greater distribution of slow-twitch muscle fibres, which \u2013 while less useful for explosive sprints \u2013 mean the body is more resistant to fatigue, and better at coping with feats of endurance. Women also have a higher distribution of fat in their lower body than men, resulting in better buoyancy in the water. This is of particular importance on a competitive swim across the Channel, where wetsuits are not permitted. Swimming is also a sport where technique is everything: it doesn\u2019t matter how much you can bench press or how fast you can run if you can\u2019t glide through the water with minimal effort. Then there\u2019s the mental resilience, something that that sports scientists are increasingly seeing women excel at in endurance events, with Thomas dedicating her swim to fellow cancer survivors.</p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/20/ford-farrell-named-as-england-go-strong-for-world-cup-opener\">George Ford and Owen Farrell have been named together</a> in England\u2019s starting XV for their Rugby World Cup opener against Tonga, with coach Eddie Jones opting for a first-choice side.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Day of mass action comes ahead of UN climate summit Good morning and welcome to this Friday briefing with Alison Rourke. Millions of students are expected to walk out of their classrooms today calling for action on the climate emergency. There has already been a huge response overnight in Australia and across the Pacific, with tens of thousands attending rallies, and you can follow all the action on our liveblog here. The event in London is expected to be part of the biggest mobilisation on the climate crisis the world has seen. Police have imposed restrictions on the scope of protests in the capital, threatening those who do not comply with arrest, a move Amnesty International UK called \u201cheavy-handed\u201d. The global mass day of action comes three days before the United Nations climate summit in New York, where Greta Thunberg will address a rally today. Fridays for Future has published a detailed map of what\u2019s going on where, which can be filtered by country and location. If you\u2019re looking for inspiration to join the strike today check out the climate crisis in 10 charts, including the rise of CO2, forest destruction, global temperature increase and the uptake of renewables and electric vehicles. The impact of these changes on global health has also been highlighted by a survey of members of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. The vast majority believe governments and health bodies are failing to prepare adequately for the medical impacts of global heating. * * * Brexit \u2013 Labour kicks off its annual conference tomorrow with a row over Brexit brewing, as party activists vow to force a vote on it becoming a clear party of remain, regardless of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal stance. Corbyn has repeatedly declined to say which side he would campaign on, if any, at a potential second referendum, after pledging that as prime minister he would negotiate a better Brexit deal and put that to a public vote alongside the option of remain. The conference will take place in the shadow of the expected supreme court decision \u2013 promised by the president of the court for early next week \u2013 on the legality parliament being prorogued. The final arguments in the court yesterday afternoon hinged on who has the power to bring parliament back. In his closing submissions, Lord Pannick QC, representing the legal campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, said that if the supreme court found that Johnson had acted unlawfully but he declined to end the suspension of parliament then \u201cin those circumstances we believe it would be open to the Speaker and Lord Speaker to reassemble parliament \u2026 as soon as possible next week\u201d. * * * Trump whistleblower \u2013 Reports that the president made worrying promises to a foreign leader gathered momentum overnight as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, offered conflicting answers to questions on whether he (Giuliani) had asked Ukraine to investigate the former vice-president, and 2020 presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. At one point Guiliani, in an interview on CNN, dismissed the claim as ridiculous before admitting it and saying he was proud of it. The reports of Trump\u2019s alleged promises so troubled a US intelligence official that it prompted a whistleblower complaint. The intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, determined that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d, a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees. * * * \u2018Shameful rise\u2019 \u2013 The number of children leaving school without basic qualifications by the age of 18 has risen by nearly a quarter in the past three years, according to a report by the children\u2019s commissioner for England. Almost one in five children (18%) left school last year without the government benchmark of five good GCSEs, or the equivalent technical qualifications. The figures for children with special educational needs are particularly stark with almost half (45%) failing to reach what is known as level 2 attainment by the time they finish compulsory education. Pupils on free school meals (FSM) also fared badly with more than one in three (37%) leaving school \u201cwithout any substantive qualifications\u201d. The children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Longfield, described the figures as shameful and called on the government to urgently investigate * * * Reporting rape \u2013 Thousands of allegations have been inaccurately recorded by the police over the past three years and in some cases never appeared in official figures, the Guardian has revealed. A review of audits of 34 police forces published between August 2016 and July 2019 showed only three of them were found to have accurately recorded complaints of rape. Of the more than 4,900 audited rape reports, 552 were found to be inaccurate. Complainants with mental health and addiction issues and victims of trafficking were particularly vulnerable to being struck from the record by a number of police forces. * * * Hobbit insect \u2013 New Zealand researchers have named an insect after JRR Tolkien\u2019s famous character Frodo Baggins. The insect is smaller than its relations and is found in the country\u2019s South Island, where The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit were filmed. The psylla frodobagginsi was identified during PhD reserach into psyllid insects. Measuring just 1.24mm, it is most easily identified by \u201cits small dimension, light colours, and uniformly spotted wings\u201d. Today in Focus podcast: Where did it all go wrong for David Cameron? As the former PM publishes his memoirs, Patrick Wintour tells Anushka Asthana that Cameron\u2019s pursuit of austerity and decision to call an EU referendum sowed the seeds of his demise. Plus, in opinion, George Monbiot on the global climate strike. Lunchtime read: It\u2019s no surprise a woman was the first to cross the Channel four times When Sarah Thomas, a 37-year-old from Colorado, emerged from the Channel on Tuesday morning after four non-stop crossings, she admitted to being \u201cpretty tired right now\u201d, but those who follow outdoor swimming are not surprised it was a woman who achieved this monumental feat, writes Alexandra Heminsley. Women have been dominating outdoor endurance swimming for some time, and a combination of obvious and not-so-obvious factors shows that the average Channel crossing time for women is faster than that for men. In general, women have a greater distribution of slow-twitch muscle fibres, which \u2013 while less useful for explosive sprints \u2013 mean the body is more resistant to fatigue, and better at coping with feats of endurance. Women also have a higher distribution of fat in their lower body than men, resulting in better buoyancy in the water. This is of particular importance on a competitive swim across the Channel, where wetsuits are not permitted. Swimming is also a sport where technique is everything: it doesn\u2019t matter how much you can bench press or how fast you can run if you can\u2019t glide through the water with minimal effort. Then there\u2019s the mental resilience, something that that sports scientists are increasingly seeing women excel at in endurance events, with Thomas dedicating her swim to fellow cancer survivors. Sport George Ford and Owen Farrell have been named together in England\u2019s starting XV for their Rugby World Cup opener against Tonga, with coach Eddie Jones opting for a first-choice side. As Japan wakes up to the arrival of rugby giants, Russia claims the pressure is all on the home nation ahead of the tournament opener. Mason Greenwood scored his first club goal and came to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s rescue in Manchester United\u2019s unimpressive Europa League victory over Astana. Castleford aim to \u201cspoil more parties\u201d after proving too good for Warrington in the Super League play-offs. Peter Beardsley has been banned from football for 32 weeks after being found guilty of three charges of racially abusing black players while coach of the Newcastle under-23 team. And Wales attack coach Rob Howley faces a long wait for the investigation into his suspected breach of rugby\u2019s betting rules to conclude, a delay that could affect his chances of coaching with Italy or the British &amp; Irish Lions. Business The future of Thomas Cook is hanging in the balance as the travel company scrambles to raise an additional \u00a3200m to secure an emergency rescue deal. Britain\u2019s oldest package-holiday firm must secure the funds before a crucial meeting next Friday after a last-minute demand from its lenders, which include about 10 banks led by RBS, Barclays and Lloyds. In the past fortnight, the banks told Thomas Cook it needed the extra money as a contingency to see it through the winter, on top of a \u00a3900m package that was close to being finalised. If the company cannot secure the extra funding it risks going bust. The pound is buying \u20ac1.134 and $1.252.

The joint standing committee on intelligence and security had asked the department how many search warrants, surveillance devices and computer access warrants had been sought by state and territory police in relation to journalists. As Guardian Australia reported on Friday, the department declined to provide those statistics. Pezzullo told the committee on Friday that he could not \u201cchange gravity\u201d, because warrants were not broken down into categories of what job the person the warrant was issued against held. He said there needed to be a \u201ctrusted dialogue\u201d between the department and media for negotiating ahead of publication of leaked information. \u201cThis does happen, and I want to assure the committee stories are published, both in the criminal space, in the terror space, and indeed in other areas whereby through sensible, mature, quiet negotiations \u2026 stories are either held, certain details that could lead to somebody being killed \u2026 their identity is veiled, and there is a process of negotiation that is not censorship,\u201d he said. He said journalists in the national security and defence rounds tended to take this approach, and there were potentially \u201cfewer than two dozen\u201d who were considered trusted in the security and defence field, which he put down to the disruption in the media industry and the reduction in specialised beat reporting where journalists can become experts in their field. \u201cThe industry has gone through major disruption,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are about two dozen people who have the judgment, the depth, the scale of knowledge, who have got the wit, and the sensibility to come forward and say \u2018Look I\u2019m going to run this yarn whether you like it or not.

Earlier in the hearing, the AFP deputy commissioner, Neil Gaughan, defended the agency\u2019s decision not to investigate who leaked then-classified advice from Asio regarding the potential impact of the medevac legislation on national security. A Guardian Australia freedom of information request revealed in July that just 11 people, including the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and Pezzullo had been sent the final document, but the case was still dropped. Gaughan argued that more than 200 people had access to some parts of the draft or the final document. \u201cThe information in the papers could have come from the draft or from the final document.

      "body": "<p>We are at war with the mosquito. A swarming and consuming army of 110tn enemy mosquitoes patrols every inch of the globe except for Antarctica, Iceland and a handful of French Polynesian micro-islands. The biting female warrior of this droning insect population is armed with at least 15 lethal and debilitating biological weapons, to be used against 7.7 billion humans deploying suspect and often self-detrimental defensive capabilities. In fact, our defence budget for personal shields, sprays and other means of deterring her unrelenting raids is $11bn (\u00a38.8bn) a year, and rising rapidly. And yet her deadly offensive campaigns and crimes against humanity continue with reckless abandon. While our counterattacks are reducing the number of casualties she perpetrates \u2013 malaria deaths in particular are <a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Mapping-the-End-of-Malaria\" title=\"\">declining rapidly</a> \u2013 the mosquito remains the deadliest hunter of human beings on the planet. </p> <p>Taking a broad range of estimates into account, since 2000, the average annual number of human deaths caused by the mosquito was around 2 million. Humans came in a distant second at 475,000, followed by snakes (50,000), dogs and sandflies (25,000 each), the tsetse fly, and the assassin or kissing bug (10,000 each). The fierce killers of lore and Hollywood celebrity were much further down our list. The crocodile was ranked 10th, with 1,000 annual deaths. Next on the list were hippos with 500, and elephants and lions with 100 fatalities each. The much-slandered shark and wolf shared 15th position, killing an average of 10 people per annum.</p> <p>Yet the mosquito does not directly harm anyone. It is the toxic and highly evolved diseases she transmits that cause an endless barrage of desolation and death. Without her, however, these sinister pathogens could not be transferred or vectored to humans, nor could they continue their cyclical contagion. In fact, without her, these diseases would not exist at all.</p> <p>Our immune systems are finely tuned to our local environments. Mosquitoes do not respect international borders. Marching armies, inquisitive explorers and land-hungry colonists brought new diseases to distant lands, but were also brought to their knees by micro-organisms in the foreign lands they intended to conquer. As the mosquito transformed the landscapes of civilisation, humans were unwittingly required to respond to her universal projection of power. After all, the truth is that, more than any other external participant, the mosquito, as our deadliest predator, drove the events of human history to create our present reality.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It has been one of the most universally recognisable and aggravating sounds on Earth for 190m years \u2013 the whine of a mosquito. After a long day of walking while camping with your family or friends, you quickly shower, settle into your lawn chair, open an ice-cold beer and exhale a deep, contented sigh. Before you can enjoy your first satisfying swig, however, you hear that all-too-familiar sound, signalling the approach of your soon-to-be tormentors.</p> <p>It is nearing dusk, her favourite time to feed. Although you heard her droning arrival, she gently lands on your ankle without detection, as she usually bites close to the ground. It is always a female, by the way. She conducts a tender, probing, 10-second reconnaissance, looking for a prime blood vessel. With her backside in the air, she steadies her crosshairs and zeros in with six sophisticated needles. She inserts two serrated mandible cutting blades (much like an electric carving knife, with two blades shifting back and forth), and saws into your skin, while two other retractors open a passage for the proboscis, a hypodermic syringe that emerges from its protective sheath. With this straw she starts to suck out 3-5 mg of your blood, immediately excreting its water while condensing its 20% protein content. All the while, a sixth needle is pumping in saliva that contains an anticoagulant, preventing your blood from clotting at the puncture site. This shortens her feeding time, lessening the likelihood that you feel her penetration and splat her across your ankle. The anticoagulant causes an allergic reaction, leaving an itchy bump as her parting gift. The mosquito bite is an intricate and innovative feeding ritual required for reproduction. She needs your blood to grow and mature her eggs.</p> <p>Please don\u2019t feel singled out. She bites everyone. There is absolutely no truth to the persistent myths that mosquitoes fancy females over males, that they prefer blonds and redheads over those with darker hair, or that the darker or more leathery your skin, the safer you are from her bite. It is true, however, that she does play favourites and feasts on some more than others. Blood type O seems to be the vintage of choice over types A and B, or their blend. People with blood type O get bitten twice as often as those with type A, with type B falling somewhere in between. (Disney/Pixar must have done their homework when portraying a tipsy mosquito ordering a \u201cBloody Mary, O-positive\u201d in the 1998 movie A Bug\u2019s Life.) Those who have higher natural levels of certain chemicals in their skin, particularly lactic acid, also seem to be more attractive. From these elements, she can analyse which blood type you are. These are the same chemicals that determine an individual\u2019s level of skin bacteria and unique body odour. While you may offend others and perhaps yourself, in this case, being pungently rancid is a good thing, for it increases bacterial levels on the skin, which makes you less alluring to mosquitoes \u2013 except for stinky feet, which emit a bacterium that is a mosquito aphrodisiac. The mosquito is also enticed by deodorants, perfumes, soap and other applied fragrances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2800b93b712dc3cd472b7ef1d607ce6e7e359707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2800b93b712dc3cd472b7ef1d607ce6e7e359707/0_233_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The larvae and pupae of Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The larvae and pupae of Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Becksholt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also has an affinity for beer drinkers. Wearing bright colours is also not a wise choice, since she hunts by both sight and smell \u2013 the latter depending chiefly on the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled by the potential target. So all your thrashing and huffing and puffing only magnetises mosquitoes and puts you at greater risk. She can smell carbon dioxide from 200 feet away. When you exercise, you emit more carbon dioxide through frequency of breath and output. You also sweat, releasing those appetising chemicals, primarily lactic acid, that invite the mosquito\u2019s attention. Lastly, your body temperature rises \u2013 an easily identifiable heat signature. On average, pregnant women suffer twice as many bites, as they respire 20% more carbon dioxide, and have a marginally elevated body temperature. This is bad news for the mother and the foetus when it comes to infection from Zika and malaria.</p> <p>Unlike their female counterparts, male mosquitoes do not bite. Their world revolves around two things: nectar and sex. Like other flying insects, when they are ready to mate, male mosquitoes assemble over a prominent feature in the landscape \u2013 from chimneys to antennas to trees to people. Many of us grumble and flail in frustration as that dogged cloud of bugs droning over our heads shadows us when we walk, refusing to disperse. Take it as a compliment. Male mosquitoes have graced you with the honour of being a \u201cswarm marker\u201d. Mosquito swarms have been photographed extending 1,000 feet into the air, resembling a tornado funnel cloud. With the cocksure males stubbornly assembled over your head, females will fly into their horde to find a suitable mate. While males will mate frequently in a lifetime, one dose of sperm is all the female needs to produce numerous batches of offspring. She stores the sperm and dispenses them piecemeal for each separate birthing of eggs. Her short moment of passion has provided one of the two necessary components for procreation. The only ingredient missing is your blood.</p> <p>Back at the campsite, you have just finished your strenuous hike, and proceed to the shower, where you lather up with soap and shampoo. After drying off, you apply body spray and deodorant before finally putting on your bright red-and-blue beachwear.</p> <p>It is nearing dusk \u2013 dinnertime for the Anopheles mosquito. You have done everything in your power to lure a famished female of the species. Having just mated in a swarming frenzy of eager male suitors, she willingly takes the bait and makes off with a few drops of your blood \u2013 a blood meal three times her own body weight. She quickly finds the nearest vertical surface and, with the aid of gravity, continues to evacuate the water from your blood. Using this concentrated blood, she will develop her eggs over the next few days. She then deposits roughly 200 floating eggs on the surface of a small pool of water that has collected on a crushed beer can that was overlooked during cleanup as you and your party headed home. She always lays her eggs in water, although she does not need much. From a pond or stream to a minuscule puddle in the bottom of an old container, used tire or backyard toy, any will suffice.</p> <p>Our mosquito will continue to bite and lay eggs during her one-to-three-week lifespan. While she can fly up to two miles, she rarely ranges more than 400 metres from her birthplace. Although it takes a few days longer in cool weather, given the high temperatures, her eggs hatch into wiggling, water-bound worms within two or three days. Skimming the water for food, they quickly turn into upside-down, comma-shaped tumbling caterpillars who breathe through two \u201ctrumpets\u201d protruding from their water-exposed buttocks. A few days later, a protective encasement splits and healthy adult mosquitoes take flight, with a new generation of succubus females ready to feed. This maturation to adulthood takes roughly one week.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Bacteria, viruses and parasites, along with worms and fungi, have triggered untold misery, and have commanded the course of human history. Why have these pathogens evolved to exterminate their hosts? If we can set aside our bias for a moment, we can see that these microbes have journeyed through the natural selection voyage just as we have. This is why they still make us sick and are so difficult to eradicate. You may be puzzled: it seems self-defeating and detrimental to kill your host. The disease kills us, yes, but the symptoms of the disease are ways in which the microbe conscripts us to help it spread and reproduce. It is dazzlingly clever, when you stop to think about it. Generally, germs guarantee their contagion and replication prior to killing their hosts. Some, like the salmonella \u201cfood poisoning\u201d bacteria and various worms, wait to be ingested \u2013 that is, one animal eating another animal.</p> <p>There is a wide range of waterborne transmitters, including giardia, cholera, typhoid, dysentery and hepatitis. Others, including the common cold, the 24-hour flu and true influenza, are passed on through coughing and sneezing. Some, such as smallpox, are transferred directly or indirectly by lesions, open sores, contaminated objects or coughing. My personal favourites \u2013 strictly from an evolutionary standpoint, of course \u2013 are those that covertly ensure their reproduction while we intimately ensure our own. These include the full gamut of microbes that trigger sexually transmitted diseases. Many sinister pathogens are passed from mother to foetus in utero.</p> <p>Others that germinate typhus, bubonic plague, Chagas and trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) catch a free ride provided by a vector (an organism that transmits disease) such as fleas, mites, flies, ticks and mosquitoes. To maximise their chances of survival, many germs use a combination of more than one method. The diverse collection of symptoms, or modes of transference, assembled by micro-organisms helps them effectively procreate and ensures the existence of their species. These germs fight for their survival just as much as we do, and stay an evolutionary step ahead of us as they continue to morph and shape-shift to circumvent our best means of extermination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>To understand the stealthy, sprawling influence of the mosquito on history and humanity, it is first necessary to appreciate the animal itself, and the diseases it transmits. According to a quotation erroneously attributed to Charles Darwin: \u201cIt is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.\u201d Regardless of the origin of this passage, the mosquito and its diseases \u2013 most notably malaria parasites \u2013 are the quintessential example of the point it is making. They are masters of evolutionary adaptation. Mosquitoes can evolve and adapt to their changing environments within a few generations. During the Blitz of 1940-41, for example, as German bombs rained down on London, isolated populations of Culex mosquitoes were confined to the air-raid tunnel shelters of the London Underground, along with the city\u2019s resilient citizens. These trapped mosquitoes quickly adapted to feed on mice, rats and humans instead of birds, and are now a species distinct from their above-ground parental ancestors.</p> <p>What should have taken thousands of years of evolution was accomplished in less than 100. \u201cIn another 100 years,\u201d jokes Richard Jones, former president of the British Entomological and Natural History Society, \u201cthere may be separate Circle line, Metropolitan line and Jubilee line mosquito species in the tunnels below London.\u201d</p> <p>While the mosquito is miraculously adaptable, it is also a purely narcissistic creature. Unlike other insects, it does not pollinate plants in any meaningful way, or aerate the soil, or ingest waste. Contrary to popular belief, the mosquito does not even serve as an indispensable food source for any other animal. She has no purpose other than to propagate her species, and perhaps to kill humans. As the apex predator throughout our odyssey, it appears that her role in our relationship is to act as a countermeasure against uncontrolled human population growth.</p> <p>Throughout our existence, the mosquito\u2019s toxic twins of malaria and yellow fever have been the prevailing agents of death and historical change, playing the role of antagonists in the protracted chronological war between man and mosquito.</p> <p>Following that fateful mosquito bite, the miscreant malaria parasite will mutate and reproduce inside your liver for one to two weeks, during which time you will show no symptoms. A toxic army of this new mutated form will then explode out of your liver and invade your bloodstream. The parasites attach to your red blood cells, penetrate the outer defences, and feast on the haemoglobin within. Inside the cell, they undergo another metamorphosis and reproductive cycle. Engorged blood cells eventually burst, spewing both a duplicate form, which marches forward to attack fresh red blood cells and also a new \u201casexual\u201d form that relaxedly floats in your bloodstream, waiting for mosquito transportation.</p> <p>The parasite is a shape-shifter, and it is precisely this genetic flexibility that makes it so difficult to eradicate or suppress with drugs or vaccines. You are now gravely ill with an orderly, clockwork progression of chills followed by a mercury-driving fever that may touch 41C. This full-blown cyclical malarial episode has you in its firm grip, and you are at the mercy of the parasite. Lying prostrate and agonisingly helpless on sweat-soaked sheets, you twitch and fumble, curse and moan. You look down and notice that your spleen and liver are visibly enlarged, your skin has the yellowing patina of jaundice and you vomit sporadically. Your fever will relapse at precise intervals with each new burst and invasion of the parasite from your blood cells. The fever then subsides while the parasite eats and reproduces inside new blood cells.</p> <p>The parasite uses sophisticated signalling to synchronise its sequencing, and this entire cycle adheres to a very strict schedule. The new asexual form transmits a chemical \u201cbite me\u201d signal in our blood, significantly boosting the chances of being picked up by a mosquito from an infected human to complete the reproductive cycle. Inside the stomach of the mosquito, these cells mutate once more, into both male and female varieties. They quickly mate, producing threadlike offspring that make their way out of the gut and into the salivary glands of the mosquito. Within the saliva glands, the malaria parasite shrewdly manipulates the mosquito to bite more frequently by suppressing the production of her anticoagulant and thus minimising her blood intake during a single feeding. This forces her to bite more frequently to get her required fill. In doing so, the malaria parasite ensures that it maximises its rate and range of transfer, its procreation and its survival.</p> <p>Temperature is an important element for both mosquito reproduction and the life cycle of malaria. Given their symbiotic relationship, they are also both climate-sensitive. In colder temperatures, it takes longer for mosquito eggs to mature and hatch. Mosquitoes are also cold-blooded and, unlike mammals, cannot regulate their own body temperatures. They simply cannot survive in environments below 10C. Mosquitoes are generally at their prime health and peak performance in temperatures above 23C. A direct heat of 40C degrees will boil mosquitoes to death. For temperate, non-tropical zones, this means that mosquitoes are seasonal creatures with breeding, hatching and biting taking place from spring through autumn. Although never seeing the outside world, malaria needs to contend with both the short lifespan of the mosquito and temperature conditions to ensure replication. The timeframe of malaria reproduction is dependent on the temperature of the cold-blooded mosquito, which itself is dependent on the temperature outside. The colder the mosquito, the more sluggish malaria reproduction becomes, eventually hitting a threshold. Between 15C and 21C (depending on the type of malaria), the reproductive cycle of the parasite can take up to a month, exceeding the average life span of the mosquito. By then, she is long dead, and brings malaria down with her.</p> <p>Warmer climates can sustain year-round mosquito populations, promoting endemic circulation of her diseases. Abnormally high temperatures can cause seasonal epidemics of mosquito-borne diseases in regions where they are generally absent or fleeting. Global warming also allows the mosquito and her diseases to broaden their topographical range. As temperatures rise, disease-carrying species, usually confined to southern regions and lower altitudes, creep north and into higher elevations.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since a breakthrough discovery by a team led by the biochemist Dr Jennifer Doudna at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012, the revolutionary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gene-editing\" title=\"\">gene-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gene-editing\" title=\"\">editing</a> innovation known as Crispr has shocked the world and altered our preconceived notions about our planet and our place on it.</p> <p>The pages of many widely read magazines and journals are currently consumed by the topic of Crispr and mosquitoes. First successfully used in 2013, Crispr is a procedure that snips out a section of DNA sequencing from a gene and replaces it with another desired one, permanently altering a genome, quickly, cheaply, and accurately.</p> <p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been funding research into mosquito-borne diseases since its creation in 2000. In 2016 it made investments in Crispr mosquito research totalling $75m. \u201cOur investments in mosquito control,\u201d said the foundation, \u201cinclude nontraditional biological and genetic approaches as well as new chemical interventions aimed at depleting or incapacitating disease-transmitting mosquito populations.\u201d These genetic approaches include the use of Crispr machinery to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases, most notably malaria.</p> <p>The strategic goal of the Gates Foundation is the extermination of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases; it is not to bring the mosquito \u2013 which is harmless when flying solo, untethered from a hitchhiking micro-organism \u2013 to the brink of extinction. Of the more than 3,500 mosquito species, only a few hundred are capable of vectoring disease. Prefabricated, genetically modified mosquitoes rendered incapable of harbouring the parasite (a hereditary trait passed down their bloodline) might just end the timeless scourge of malaria. But, as Doudna and the Gates Foundation are aware, gene-swapping technology also has the potential to unleash darker, more sinister genetic blueprints with dangerous possibilities. Crispr research is a global phenomenon, and neither Doudna nor the foundation has a monopoly on its limitless designs, its instruments of implementation or its operational execution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"522ffbb0dea84079028caad602e5c62e3a879c53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522ffbb0dea84079028caad602e5c62e3a879c53/0_0_2200_1570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill and Melinda Gates during a visit to Mozambique.

This theory has been floating around the scientific community since the 1960s. Crispr can now put these principles into practice. To be fair, the mosquito altered our DNA in the form of sickle cell and other genetic malarial safeguards; perhaps it is time to return the favour. Male mosquitoes that have been genetically modified with domineering \u201cselfish genes\u201d using Crispr are released into mosquito zones to breed with females to produce stillborn, infertile or only male offspring. The mosquito would be extinct in one or two generations. With this war-winning weapon, humanity would never again have to fear the bite of a mosquito. We would awaken to a brave new world, one without mosquito-borne disease.</p> <p>An alternative is simply to make mosquitos harmless, a strategy supported and funded by the Gates Foundation. With \u201cgene drive\u201d technology, Gates explained in October 2018, \u201cessentially, scientists could introduce a gene into a mosquito population that would either suppress the population \u2013 or prevent it from spreading malaria. For decades, it was difficult to test this idea. But with the discovery of Crispr, the research became a lot easier. And just last month, a team from the research consortium Target Malaria announced that they had completed studies where mosquito populations were fully suppressed. To be clear: the test was only in a series of laboratory cages filled with 600 mosquitoes each. But it is a promising start.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Anthony James, a molecular geneticist at the University of California, Irvine, Crispr\u2019d a species of Anopheles mosquito to make it incapable of spreading malaria, by eliminating the parasites as they are processed through the mosquito\u2019s salivary gland. \u201cWe added a small package of genes,\u201d explains James, \u201cthat allows the mosquitoes to function as they always have, except for one slight change\u201d \u2013 they can no longer harbour the malaria parasite.</p> <p>The Aedes breed is more difficult to tackle, since it transmits a handful of diseases that include yellow fever, Zika, West Nile, chikungunya, Mayaro, dengue and other encephalitides. \u201cWhat you need to do is engineer a gene drive that makes the insects sterile,\u201d James said of the Aedes breed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to build a mosquito resistant to Zika if it could still transmit dengue and other diseases.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/14/a-different-dimension-of-loss-great-insect-die-off-sixth-extinction\">\u2018A different dimension of loss\u2019: inside the great insect die-off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have valid, although yet unknown, reasons to be careful what we wish for.

      "bodyText": "We are at war with the mosquito. A swarming and consuming army of 110tn enemy mosquitoes patrols every inch of the globe except for Antarctica, Iceland and a handful of French Polynesian micro-islands. The biting female warrior of this droning insect population is armed with at least 15 lethal and debilitating biological weapons, to be used against 7.7 billion humans deploying suspect and often self-detrimental defensive capabilities. In fact, our defence budget for personal shields, sprays and other means of deterring her unrelenting raids is $11bn (\u00a38.8bn) a year, and rising rapidly. And yet her deadly offensive campaigns and crimes against humanity continue with reckless abandon. While our counterattacks are reducing the number of casualties she perpetrates \u2013 malaria deaths in particular are declining rapidly \u2013 the mosquito remains the deadliest hunter of human beings on the planet. Taking a broad range of estimates into account, since 2000, the average annual number of human deaths caused by the mosquito was around 2 million. Humans came in a distant second at 475,000, followed by snakes (50,000), dogs and sandflies (25,000 each), the tsetse fly, and the assassin or kissing bug (10,000 each). The fierce killers of lore and Hollywood celebrity were much further down our list. The crocodile was ranked 10th, with 1,000 annual deaths. Next on the list were hippos with 500, and elephants and lions with 100 fatalities each. The much-slandered shark and wolf shared 15th position, killing an average of 10 people per annum. Yet the mosquito does not directly harm anyone. It is the toxic and highly evolved diseases she transmits that cause an endless barrage of desolation and death. Without her, however, these sinister pathogens could not be transferred or vectored to humans, nor could they continue their cyclical contagion. In fact, without her, these diseases would not exist at all. Our immune systems are finely tuned to our local environments. Mosquitoes do not respect international borders. Marching armies, inquisitive explorers and land-hungry colonists brought new diseases to distant lands, but were also brought to their knees by micro-organisms in the foreign lands they intended to conquer. As the mosquito transformed the landscapes of civilisation, humans were unwittingly required to respond to her universal projection of power. After all, the truth is that, more than any other external participant, the mosquito, as our deadliest predator, drove the events of human history to create our present reality. * * * It has been one of the most universally recognisable and aggravating sounds on Earth for 190m years \u2013 the whine of a mosquito. After a long day of walking while camping with your family or friends, you quickly shower, settle into your lawn chair, open an ice-cold beer and exhale a deep, contented sigh. Before you can enjoy your first satisfying swig, however, you hear that all-too-familiar sound, signalling the approach of your soon-to-be tormentors. It is nearing dusk, her favourite time to feed. Although you heard her droning arrival, she gently lands on your ankle without detection, as she usually bites close to the ground. It is always a female, by the way. She conducts a tender, probing, 10-second reconnaissance, looking for a prime blood vessel. With her backside in the air, she steadies her crosshairs and zeros in with six sophisticated needles. She inserts two serrated mandible cutting blades (much like an electric carving knife, with two blades shifting back and forth), and saws into your skin, while two other retractors open a passage for the proboscis, a hypodermic syringe that emerges from its protective sheath. With this straw she starts to suck out 3-5 mg of your blood, immediately excreting its water while condensing its 20% protein content. All the while, a sixth needle is pumping in saliva that contains an anticoagulant, preventing your blood from clotting at the puncture site. This shortens her feeding time, lessening the likelihood that you feel her penetration and splat her across your ankle. The anticoagulant causes an allergic reaction, leaving an itchy bump as her parting gift. The mosquito bite is an intricate and innovative feeding ritual required for reproduction. She needs your blood to grow and mature her eggs. Please don\u2019t feel singled out. She bites everyone. There is absolutely no truth to the persistent myths that mosquitoes fancy females over males, that they prefer blonds and redheads over those with darker hair, or that the darker or more leathery your skin, the safer you are from her bite. It is true, however, that she does play favourites and feasts on some more than others. Blood type O seems to be the vintage of choice over types A and B, or their blend. People with blood type O get bitten twice as often as those with type A, with type B falling somewhere in between. (Disney/Pixar must have done their homework when portraying a tipsy mosquito ordering a \u201cBloody Mary, O-positive\u201d in the 1998 movie A Bug\u2019s Life.) Those who have higher natural levels of certain chemicals in their skin, particularly lactic acid, also seem to be more attractive. From these elements, she can analyse which blood type you are. These are the same chemicals that determine an individual\u2019s level of skin bacteria and unique body odour. While you may offend others and perhaps yourself, in this case, being pungently rancid is a good thing, for it increases bacterial levels on the skin, which makes you less alluring to mosquitoes \u2013 except for stinky feet, which emit a bacterium that is a mosquito aphrodisiac. The mosquito is also enticed by deodorants, perfumes, soap and other applied fragrances. She also has an affinity for beer drinkers. Wearing bright colours is also not a wise choice, since she hunts by both sight and smell \u2013 the latter depending chiefly on the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled by the potential target. So all your thrashing and huffing and puffing only magnetises mosquitoes and puts you at greater risk. She can smell carbon dioxide from 200 feet away. When you exercise, you emit more carbon dioxide through frequency of breath and output. You also sweat, releasing those appetising chemicals, primarily lactic acid, that invite the mosquito\u2019s attention. Lastly, your body temperature rises \u2013 an easily identifiable heat signature. On average, pregnant women suffer twice as many bites, as they respire 20% more carbon dioxide, and have a marginally elevated body temperature. This is bad news for the mother and the foetus when it comes to infection from Zika and malaria. Unlike their female counterparts, male mosquitoes do not bite. Their world revolves around two things: nectar and sex. Like other flying insects, when they are ready to mate, male mosquitoes assemble over a prominent feature in the landscape \u2013 from chimneys to antennas to trees to people.

While males will mate frequently in a lifetime, one dose of sperm is all the female needs to produce numerous batches of offspring.

After drying off, you apply body spray and deodorant before finally putting on your bright red-and-blue beachwear. It is nearing dusk \u2013 dinnertime for the Anopheles mosquito. You have done everything in your power to lure a famished female of the species. Having just mated in a swarming frenzy of eager male suitors, she willingly takes the bait and makes off with a few drops of your blood \u2013 a blood meal three times her own body weight. She quickly finds the nearest vertical surface and, with the aid of gravity, continues to evacuate the water from your blood. Using this concentrated blood, she will develop her eggs over the next few days. She then deposits roughly 200 floating eggs on the surface of a small pool of water that has collected on a crushed beer can that was overlooked during cleanup as you and your party headed home. She always lays her eggs in water, although she does not need much. From a pond or stream to a minuscule puddle in the bottom of an old container, used tire or backyard toy, any will suffice. Our mosquito will continue to bite and lay eggs during her one-to-three-week lifespan. While she can fly up to two miles, she rarely ranges more than 400 metres from her birthplace. Although it takes a few days longer in cool weather, given the high temperatures, her eggs hatch into wiggling, water-bound worms within two or three days. Skimming the water for food, they quickly turn into upside-down, comma-shaped tumbling caterpillars who breathe through two \u201ctrumpets\u201d protruding from their water-exposed buttocks. A few days later, a protective encasement splits and healthy adult mosquitoes take flight, with a new generation of succubus females ready to feed.

During the Blitz of 1940-41, for example, as German bombs rained down on London, isolated populations of Culex mosquitoes were confined to the air-raid tunnel shelters of the London Underground, along with the city\u2019s resilient citizens. These trapped mosquitoes quickly adapted to feed on mice, rats and humans instead of birds, and are now a species distinct from their above-ground parental ancestors. What should have taken thousands of years of evolution was accomplished in less than 100. \u201cIn another 100 years,\u201d jokes Richard Jones, former president of the British Entomological and Natural History Society, \u201cthere may be separate Circle line, Metropolitan line and Jubilee line mosquito species in the tunnels below London.\u201d While the mosquito is miraculously adaptable, it is also a purely narcissistic creature. Unlike other insects, it does not pollinate plants in any meaningful way, or aerate the soil, or ingest waste. Contrary to popular belief, the mosquito does not even serve as an indispensable food source for any other animal. She has no purpose other than to propagate her species, and perhaps to kill humans. As the apex predator throughout our odyssey, it appears that her role in our relationship is to act as a countermeasure against uncontrolled human population growth. Throughout our existence, the mosquito\u2019s toxic twins of malaria and yellow fever have been the prevailing agents of death and historical change, playing the role of antagonists in the protracted chronological war between man and mosquito. Following that fateful mosquito bite, the miscreant malaria parasite will mutate and reproduce inside your liver for one to two weeks, during which time you will show no symptoms. A toxic army of this new mutated form will then explode out of your liver and invade your bloodstream. The parasites attach to your red blood cells, penetrate the outer defences, and feast on the haemoglobin within. Inside the cell, they undergo another metamorphosis and reproductive cycle. Engorged blood cells eventually burst, spewing both a duplicate form, which marches forward to attack fresh red blood cells and also a new \u201casexual\u201d form that relaxedly floats in your bloodstream, waiting for mosquito transportation. The parasite is a shape-shifter, and it is precisely this genetic flexibility that makes it so difficult to eradicate or suppress with drugs or vaccines. You are now gravely ill with an orderly, clockwork progression of chills followed by a mercury-driving fever that may touch 41C. This full-blown cyclical malarial episode has you in its firm grip, and you are at the mercy of the parasite. Lying prostrate and agonisingly helpless on sweat-soaked sheets, you twitch and fumble, curse and moan. You look down and notice that your spleen and liver are visibly enlarged, your skin has the yellowing patina of jaundice and you vomit sporadically. Your fever will relapse at precise intervals with each new burst and invasion of the parasite from your blood cells. The fever then subsides while the parasite eats and reproduces inside new blood cells. The parasite uses sophisticated signalling to synchronise its sequencing, and this entire cycle adheres to a very strict schedule. The new asexual form transmits a chemical \u201cbite me\u201d signal in our blood, significantly boosting the chances of being picked up by a mosquito from an infected human to complete the reproductive cycle. Inside the stomach of the mosquito, these cells mutate once more, into both male and female varieties. They quickly mate, producing threadlike offspring that make their way out of the gut and into the salivary glands of the mosquito. Within the saliva glands, the malaria parasite shrewdly manipulates the mosquito to bite more frequently by suppressing the production of her anticoagulant and thus minimising her blood intake during a single feeding. This forces her to bite more frequently to get her required fill. In doing so, the malaria parasite ensures that it maximises its rate and range of transfer, its procreation and its survival. Temperature is an important element for both mosquito reproduction and the life cycle of malaria. Given their symbiotic relationship, they are also both climate-sensitive. In colder temperatures, it takes longer for mosquito eggs to mature and hatch. Mosquitoes are also cold-blooded and, unlike mammals, cannot regulate their own body temperatures. They simply cannot survive in environments below 10C. Mosquitoes are generally at their prime health and peak performance in temperatures above 23C. A direct heat of 40C degrees will boil mosquitoes to death. For temperate, non-tropical zones, this means that mosquitoes are seasonal creatures with breeding, hatching and biting taking place from spring through autumn. Although never seeing the outside world, malaria needs to contend with both the short lifespan of the mosquito and temperature conditions to ensure replication. The timeframe of malaria reproduction is dependent on the temperature of the cold-blooded mosquito, which itself is dependent on the temperature outside. The colder the mosquito, the more sluggish malaria reproduction becomes, eventually hitting a threshold. Between 15C and 21C (depending on the type of malaria), the reproductive cycle of the parasite can take up to a month, exceeding the average life span of the mosquito. By then, she is long dead, and brings malaria down with her. Warmer climates can sustain year-round mosquito populations, promoting endemic circulation of her diseases. Abnormally high temperatures can cause seasonal epidemics of mosquito-borne diseases in regions where they are generally absent or fleeting. Global warming also allows the mosquito and her diseases to broaden their topographical range. As temperatures rise, disease-carrying species, usually confined to southern regions and lower altitudes, creep north and into higher elevations. * * * Since a breakthrough discovery by a team led by the biochemist Dr Jennifer Doudna at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012, the revolutionary gene-editing innovation known as Crispr has shocked the world and altered our preconceived notions about our planet and our place on it. The pages of many widely read magazines and journals are currently consumed by the topic of Crispr and mosquitoes. First successfully used in 2013, Crispr is a procedure that snips out a section of DNA sequencing from a gene and replaces it with another desired one, permanently altering a genome, quickly, cheaply, and accurately. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been funding research into mosquito-borne diseases since its creation in 2000. In 2016 it made investments in Crispr mosquito research totalling $75m. \u201cOur investments in mosquito control,\u201d said the foundation, \u201cinclude nontraditional biological and genetic approaches as well as new chemical interventions aimed at depleting or incapacitating disease-transmitting mosquito populations.\u201d These genetic approaches include the use of Crispr machinery to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases, most notably malaria. The strategic goal of the Gates Foundation is the extermination of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases; it is not to bring the mosquito \u2013 which is harmless when flying solo, untethered from a hitchhiking micro-organism \u2013 to the brink of extinction. Of the more than 3,500 mosquito species, only a few hundred are capable of vectoring disease. Prefabricated, genetically modified mosquitoes rendered incapable of harbouring the parasite (a hereditary trait passed down their bloodline) might just end the timeless scourge of malaria. But, as Doudna and the Gates Foundation are aware, gene-swapping technology also has the potential to unleash darker, more sinister genetic blueprints with dangerous possibilities. Crispr research is a global phenomenon, and neither Doudna nor the foundation has a monopoly on its limitless designs, its instruments of implementation or its operational execution. It has been dubbed the \u201cextinction drive\u201d, as this is precisely what it can accomplish \u2013 the extermination of mosquitoes by way of genetic sterilisation. This theory has been floating around the scientific community since the 1960s. Crispr can now put these principles into practice. To be fair, the mosquito altered our DNA in the form of sickle cell and other genetic malarial safeguards; perhaps it is time to return the favour. Male mosquitoes that have been genetically modified with domineering \u201cselfish genes\u201d using Crispr are released into mosquito zones to breed with females to produce stillborn, infertile or only male offspring. The mosquito would be extinct in one or two generations. With this war-winning weapon, humanity would never again have to fear the bite of a mosquito. We would awaken to a brave new world, one without mosquito-borne disease. An alternative is simply to make mosquitos harmless, a strategy supported and funded by the Gates Foundation. With \u201cgene drive\u201d technology, Gates explained in October 2018, \u201cessentially, scientists could introduce a gene into a mosquito population that would either suppress the population \u2013 or prevent it from spreading malaria. For decades, it was difficult to test this idea. But with the discovery of Crispr, the research became a lot easier. And just last month, a team from the research consortium Target Malaria announced that they had completed studies where mosquito populations were fully suppressed. To be clear: the test was only in a series of laboratory cages filled with 600 mosquitoes each. But it is a promising start.\u201d Dr Anthony James, a molecular geneticist at the University of California, Irvine, Crispr\u2019d a species of Anopheles mosquito to make it incapable of spreading malaria, by eliminating the parasites as they are processed through the mosquito\u2019s salivary gland. \u201cWe added a small package of genes,\u201d explains James, \u201cthat allows the mosquitoes to function as they always have, except for one slight change\u201d \u2013 they can no longer harbour the malaria parasite. The Aedes breed is more difficult to tackle, since it transmits a handful of diseases that include yellow fever, Zika, West Nile, chikungunya, Mayaro, dengue and other encephalitides. \u201cWhat you need to do is engineer a gene drive that makes the insects sterile,\u201d James said of the Aedes breed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to build a mosquito resistant to Zika if it could still transmit dengue and other diseases.\u201d We have valid, although yet unknown, reasons to be careful what we wish for. If we eradicate disease-vectoring mosquito species, would other mosquito species or insects simply fill the ecological niche? What effect would eliminating mosquitoes have on nature\u2019s biological equilibrium? What would happen if we exterminate species that play an essential but unrecognised role in our ecosystem? We are just beginning to ask these morally fraught and biologically ambiguous questions, and for now, no one really knows the answers.

      "body": "<p>The polls keep coming, one after another. But the polls are all over the place. For example, they can\u2019t agree on where the competing parties stand. One gives the Tories a 10-point lead, another gives Labour a 2% lead. Polling has never been an exact science, but political volatility, the growth of new polling firms and the extraordinary ubiquity of conflicting polls, has put it under new strains and new scrutiny.</p> <p>Polling was once a specialised sector of market research. Now it is a niche area of the much bigger data industry, using the same Bayesian techniques of probabilistic analysis that stock markets employ in financial forecasting. Its customers include huge financial firms that can extract commercial advantage from the slightest margin of predictive accuracy.</p> <p>When it comes to prediction, the neoliberal economist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frank-Hyneman-Knight\" title=\"\">Frank Knight</a> made an important distinction between \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cuncertainty\u201d. The data revolution has helped capitalism manage risk, but it manages uncertainty far less effectively. One byproduct of this is that, although we have more data than ever before, political outcomes are no easier to predict: hence, the current crisis of polling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can no more dispense with political polling than capitalism can give up on data</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For pollsters, the risk of a \u201cwrong\u201d prediction is managed in their selection of who to interview, and how to weight the results. If young and poor voters didn\u2019t turn out last time, they probably won\u2019t this time. But in conditions of political uncertainty, these assumptions start to look like what they are: guesswork and ideology.</p> <p>By relying on past outcomes to guide their assumptions, pollsters made no room for political upsets. Since poll numbers are often used as a kind of democratic currency \u2013 a measure of \u201celectability\u201d \u2013 the effect of these methodological assumptions was to ratify the status quo. They reinforced the message: \u201cThere is no alternative.\u201d Now that there are alternatives, polling firms are scrabbling to update their models.</p> <p>Yet, what do polls actually measure? In 1947, as modern polling was becoming a major industry, researchers canvassed American public opinion on something called the \u201cMetallic Metals Act\u201d. No such act existed, metallic metals being akin to ironic irony, or tautologous tautology. But 70% of respondents took a firm view for or against. They weren\u2019t stupid: they were just acting as most of us do in an interview situation, under pressure to have definite views about something of which we may be uncertain, conflicted or even ignorant.</p> <p>These researchers weren\u2019t measuring opinion. They were producing it. This is what the polling industry does: that\u2019s why it is an industry.</p> <p>The artifice of the phone interview, or online survey, resembles no real-life circumstance in which opinions are formed. It is an assembly line designed to produce quantifiable opinions: that is, to express sentiments, preferences. This may make sense in the context of market research to measure consumer preferences. But formulating a preference, or even purchasing an item, is quite unlike casting a vote. The latter is closer to a major life decision \u2013 often rooted in collective experiences like class and race \u2013 than to a brand choice.</p> <p>The methodology of polling implies that there exists a general will on any given issue \u2013 the sum of a quantity of individual opinions of roughly equal weight. These can be totalled up into a magic percentage. But one reason voting intention polls must weight their results is that not all opinions are equally informed, committed or even meaningful. Most of us have ambivalent or downright contradictory views on some subjects, which is why small adjustments in polling questions can produce such varying results.</p> <p>So while polling, in conditions of political stability, can often accurately predict voting outcomes, its findings are less meaningful as a guide to \u201cpublic opinion\u201d on more complex issues. \u201cNothing is more inadequate,\u201d wrote the sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/28/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Pierre Bourdieu</a>, \u201cfor representing the state of opinion than a percentage.\u201d \u201cPublic opinion\u201d is a mirage.</p> <p>There is, nonetheless, something authoritative about a round figure, which appears to brook no argument. Yet, the only test of polling is its predictive power. And predictions failed in 2015, 2016 and 2017. When this happens, there is a tendency in the media to explain by reference to misleading respondents: \u201cshy Tories\u201d, for example.</p> <p>Perhaps some people deliberately obscure their real intentions.

      "bodyText": "The polls keep coming, one after another. But the polls are all over the place. For example, they can\u2019t agree on where the competing parties stand. One gives the Tories a 10-point lead, another gives Labour a 2% lead. Polling has never been an exact science, but political volatility, the growth of new polling firms and the extraordinary ubiquity of conflicting polls, has put it under new strains and new scrutiny. Polling was once a specialised sector of market research. Now it is a niche area of the much bigger data industry, using the same Bayesian techniques of probabilistic analysis that stock markets employ in financial forecasting. Its customers include huge financial firms that can extract commercial advantage from the slightest margin of predictive accuracy. When it comes to prediction, the neoliberal economist Frank Knight made an important distinction between \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cuncertainty\u201d. The data revolution has helped capitalism manage risk, but it manages uncertainty far less effectively. One byproduct of this is that, although we have more data than ever before, political outcomes are no easier to predict: hence, the current crisis of polling. For pollsters, the risk of a \u201cwrong\u201d prediction is managed in their selection of who to interview, and how to weight the results. If young and poor voters didn\u2019t turn out last time, they probably won\u2019t this time. But in conditions of political uncertainty, these assumptions start to look like what they are: guesswork and ideology. By relying on past outcomes to guide their assumptions, pollsters made no room for political upsets. Since poll numbers are often used as a kind of democratic currency \u2013 a measure of \u201celectability\u201d \u2013 the effect of these methodological assumptions was to ratify the status quo. They reinforced the message: \u201cThere is no alternative.\u201d Now that there are alternatives, polling firms are scrabbling to update their models. Yet, what do polls actually measure? In 1947, as modern polling was becoming a major industry, researchers canvassed American public opinion on something called the \u201cMetallic Metals Act\u201d. No such act existed, metallic metals being akin to ironic irony, or tautologous tautology. But 70% of respondents took a firm view for or against. They weren\u2019t stupid: they were just acting as most of us do in an interview situation, under pressure to have definite views about something of which we may be uncertain, conflicted or even ignorant. These researchers weren\u2019t measuring opinion. They were producing it. This is what the polling industry does: that\u2019s why it is an industry. The artifice of the phone interview, or online survey, resembles no real-life circumstance in which opinions are formed. It is an assembly line designed to produce quantifiable opinions: that is, to express sentiments, preferences. This may make sense in the context of market research to measure consumer preferences. But formulating a preference, or even purchasing an item, is quite unlike casting a vote. The latter is closer to a major life decision \u2013 often rooted in collective experiences like class and race \u2013 than to a brand choice. The methodology of polling implies that there exists a general will on any given issue \u2013 the sum of a quantity of individual opinions of roughly equal weight. These can be totalled up into a magic percentage. But one reason voting intention polls must weight their results is that not all opinions are equally informed, committed or even meaningful. Most of us have ambivalent or downright contradictory views on some subjects, which is why small adjustments in polling questions can produce such varying results. So while polling, in conditions of political stability, can often accurately predict voting outcomes, its findings are less meaningful as a guide to \u201cpublic opinion\u201d on more complex issues. \u201cNothing is more inadequate,\u201d wrote the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, \u201cfor representing the state of opinion than a percentage.\u201d \u201cPublic opinion\u201d is a mirage. There is, nonetheless, something authoritative about a round figure, which appears to brook no argument. Yet, the only test of polling is its predictive power. And predictions failed in 2015, 2016 and 2017. When this happens, there is a tendency in the media to explain by reference to misleading respondents: \u201cshy Tories\u201d, for example. Perhaps some people deliberately obscure their real intentions. But consider what happened in the 2010 general election, with \u201cCleggmania\u201d. For weeks, the Liberal Democrats surged, sometimes to first place, gaining strongly among young voters. In the end, they lost five seats. Why did the polls not predict this outcome correctly? Most of us, if asked about an issue we aren\u2019t sure of, or haven\u2019t thought about, will cast our minds back to the news.

That\u2019s it. The first version of Light Phone was calls only and proved too much for even the most hardened minimalist. The second version, released on September 4th, could also allow users to use maps or summon an Uber or Lyft in the future but its creators, Joe Hollier and Kai Tang, say they will never add email or any social media.</p> <p>\u201cRemember the old days when you sat down at your computer and you were connected, and then you stood up and you were disconnected.

I miss emojis \u2013 the book doesn\u2019t have them, neither does the phone. And typing on the tiny screen is a bore. The screen is minuscule, I need my glasses. I can\u2019t be bothered to send or reply to messages. But am I more bored than I would be with my little iFriend? No, I don\u2019t think so.

So many people are snapping pics for Instagram \u2013 they will all be crap \u2013 while I am enjoying the now and especially how stupid they all look. Oh the delicious sense of superiority!</p> <p>My phone use for the week drops 73%; I am still using it to read news in the office, for WhatsApp because my parents are visiting, and for some encrypted apps. (I also slipped and played a bit of Pok\u00e9mon.) But I feel very pleased with myself and maybe a little more centered. I am paying more attention, I feel less harassed. There is still that nagging feeling that I am missing something but, to be honest, I have always felt that and my phone hasn\u2019t made it better.</p> <p>At the end of the week, I go to the launch party for the Light Phone in Soho. There are a lot of smartphones and a lot of people not feeling great about them. James Russo, a marketing exec, plans to ditch his smartphone entirely once he gets a Light. \u201cI eliminated Facebook and Instagram but I still find ways to kill time on my phone. It\u2019s such a time suck,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Amina Sule, a textile designer, says she spends two or three hours a day on her phone and she wants the time back. \u201cAs much as I try to stop doing it, I just find it creeping back,\u201d she says. \u201cI need something like this to manage it.\u201d</p> <p>All the pretty people and the white wine feels very 1%. It might be OK for us to ditch our phones, but what about those who are <em>truly</em> slaves to their phone? The Uber worker, on-demand healthcare, retail and restaurant staff<strong> </strong>summoned by an app.</p> <p>Will they ever be able to turn back the clock and go Light? Probably not. They\u2019ll be too busy meeting the needs of people who can drop $350 on a second phone. But for me, it\u2019s a possibility, perhaps. Maybe I\u2019ll use the Light Phone and carry the iPhone in my bag. It feels like cheating but I want options.</p> <p>At the party Tang asks me how my week has been. His has been great \u2013 they have 50,000 people on the waitlist. I tell him it feels a little like swimming nude. Fun, slightly naughty, not always appropriate, but something I will definitely do again. I may carry my swimming trunks, though. Just in case.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For years, I have had a screensaver on my iPhone that says READ A BOOK INSTEAD. It hasn\u2019t worked. I used my phone for an average of 4 hours and 2 minutes a day last week, picking it up 103 times a day. That\u2019s about once every 10 minutes while I am awake. And for what? Pok\u00e9mon Go (yes, I am addicted), social networking and reading \u2013 in that order. And when I\u2019m not on my phone, I am on my laptop. If this sounds familiar, and somewhat nauseating, meet the Light Phone. Launched this month after a wildly successful crowdfunding campaign, Light Phone is a credit card-sized phone that only lets you make calls and text or set an alarm. That\u2019s it. The first version of Light Phone was calls only and proved too much for even the most hardened minimalist. The second version, released on September 4th, could also allow users to use maps or summon an Uber or Lyft in the future but its creators, Joe Hollier and Kai Tang, say they will never add email or any social media. \u201cRemember the old days when you sat down at your computer and you were connected, and then you stood up and you were disconnected. There was a clear separation,\u201d says Hollier. \u201cNow you\u2019re connected 24/7. This isn\u2019t what I wanted.\u201d The point of the Light Phone is to let you leave your smartphone at home (or as Tang does, in his bag) and live more of your life in the \u2013 shudder \u2013 real world. My plan was to use it for a week, leave my iPhone at home or on my desk, only using it when I could as easily have used my laptop. It proved surprisingly hard \u2013 but not for the reasons I expected. Initially, panic came in waves. What if I missed that big email or an urgent message from family and friends? I had told the office and my significant others I was on phone or text only, but that didn\u2019t stop me worrying. The extent of my dependency was manifest all week, and it\u2019s little wonder \u2013 all this screen time is rewiring our brains. We now lose concentration quicker than a goldfish (eight seconds for us, nine for the goldfish, according to one study). To my horror, I find myself reaching for the Light Phone, even though I know it does nothing, like an ex-smoker patting his pockets for his lighter. As a post-work drink with colleagues turns from gossip to football, I automatically reach for it to distract myself from sport banter before realising I have to suffer in silence. Every quiet moment, I wanted to check my phone. What the hell do I do when I need a poo? Do I now need one of those \u201ctoilet books\u201d? Often, cravings are about my \u201cneed\u201d for information. Out for pizza with my boyfriend, Larry, we start discussing the 2020 elections and Florida. How many Puerto Ricans moved there after Hurricane Maria? Will they tip the balance? I want to check my phone. The conversation shifts to Brexit. Ditto. I want my phone. And when Larry goes to the bathroom, leaving me alone at the table, you guessed it \u2013 I want my phone. I am sensing a pattern. Even watching TV I miss my phone.

My phone use for the week drops 73%; I am still using it to read news in the office, for WhatsApp because my parents are visiting, and for some encrypted apps. (I also slipped and played a bit of Pok\u00e9mon.) But I feel very pleased with myself and maybe a little more centered. I am paying more attention, I feel less harassed. There is still that nagging feeling that I am missing something but, to be honest, I have always felt that and my phone hasn\u2019t made it better. At the end of the week, I go to the launch party for the Light Phone in Soho. There are a lot of smartphones and a lot of people not feeling great about them. James Russo, a marketing exec, plans to ditch his smartphone entirely once he gets a Light. \u201cI eliminated Facebook and Instagram but I still find ways to kill time on my phone. It\u2019s such a time suck,\u201d he says. Amina Sule, a textile designer, says she spends two or three hours a day on her phone and she wants the time back. \u201cAs much as I try to stop doing it, I just find it creeping back,\u201d she says. \u201cI need something like this to manage it.\u201d All the pretty people and the white wine feels very 1%. It might be OK for us to ditch our phones, but what about those who are truly slaves to their phone? The Uber worker, on-demand healthcare, retail and restaurant staff summoned by an app. Will they ever be able to turn back the clock and go Light? Probably not. They\u2019ll be too busy meeting the needs of people who can drop $350 on a second phone. But for me, it\u2019s a possibility, perhaps. Maybe I\u2019ll use the Light Phone and carry the iPhone in my bag. It feels like cheating but I want options. At the party Tang asks me how my week has been. His has been great \u2013 they have 50,000 people on the waitlist. I tell him it feels a little like swimming nude. Fun, slightly naughty, not always appropriate, but something I will definitely do again. I may carry my swimming trunks, though. Just in case.",

HMS Montagu, a pre-first world war Duncan-class British battleship was wrecked in 1906 on Lundy island, off the Devon coast, while taking part in secret radio communication trials when a navigator miscalculated its position in heavy fog. A group of wounded veterans took part in a series of dives on the wreck site to map out exactly what remained of the ship. On Friday it was announced the government had granted protection to the wreck and also to cut steps in the granite cliff face as part of the salvage operation on the advice of Historic England. The wreck and steps have been scheduled and added to the National Heritage List for England, which protects notable buildings, sites and landscapes.

      "body": "<p>Seven years before his suicide, Tony Hancock tried to become a movie star. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/apr/16/sianpattendenwedspmpic\" title=\"\">The Rebel</a> (1961) is a comedy about a clerk who quits his job and moves to Paris to become an artist, despite his total lack of talent. Scripted by Half Hour creators Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, it was a deluxe bespoke vehicle, designed to take Hancock across the Atlantic and turn him into the new Peter Sellers.</p> <p>Brits flocked. Homegrown critics raved. And Hollywood absolutely hated it. (\u201cStumbling \u2026 presumptuous \u2026 depressing \u2026 low,\u201d reckoned the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1961/10/17/archives/screen-a-british-comictony-hancock-stars-in-call-me-genius.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a>, comparing him unfavourably to Norman Wisdom.)</p> <p>It was the start of the end. The following year, after a final series of Hancock\u2019s Half Hour minus Sid James \u2013 let go lest Hancock be defined only as part of a double act \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/27/tony-hancock-screenplay-day-off\" title=\"\">Hancock fired Galton and Simpson, too</a>. They then made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/06/you-dirty-old-man-steptoe-and-son-hancocks-half-hour-ray-galton-lines\" title=\"\">Steptoe and Son</a> (average audience: 28 million); Hancock made a second bid for international film stardom with a self-scripted feature about a Punch and Judy show in Bognor Regis.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a comedy,\u201d grimaces Paul Merton. \u201cDon\u2019t expect any laughs. It\u2019s very bitter.\u201d Merton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/17/paul-merton-my-family-values\" title=\"\">was six when he went to see it with his mother</a>, who began flinching in the first scene, when Hancock swears at the Lord Mayor. By the time he had \u201ctaken an ornamental pig and shoved a bunch of flowers up its arse, really quite violently\u201d, her fandom was substantially shaken.</p> <p>Now, those two films that kiboshed Hancock\u2019s big-screen dreams \u2013 one wonderful, one sort of awful \u2013 have been restored and rereleased with the heave-ho of Merton, a longtime keeper of the Hancock flame. The Rebel, at least, is a revelation: snappy, surreal, full of satirical horsepower and starring a baby-faced, blue-eyed bon vivant. For those of us familiar only with the black-and-white grump, the effervescence is amazing.</p> <p>Tell Merton this, and delight knocks a decade off him. \u201cRay and Alan always said Hancock seemed to have been born at 40, but in The Rebel he does have the bloom of youth in those cheeks. I think it\u2019s the smooth skin.\u201d Nice clear eyes, too. \u201cYes, wonderful!\u201d he beams.</p> <p>Yet he is still a far cry from 35-year-old leading men today, few of whom have white tufts and dialogue describing themselves as \u201cstout\u201d. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d says Merton. \u201cBut since the early days he was called \u201cTubs\u201d and there was lots of talk about his terrible feet. Comics then were meant to look a bit funny.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c678e0b4b5c22985bc67ed210881f88f1a5ac4cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c678e0b4b5c22985bc67ed210881f88f1a5ac4cb/60_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hancock in The Rebel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hancock with Liz Fraser in The Rebel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, when he remade half a dozen Half Hours in 1996 (big ratings, iffy reviews), he says you would never have guessed he and Hancock were the same age at the time of shooting: \u201cIt was to do with the war and with nutrition.\u201d Plus, this was the era of Sgt Pepper, when 64 was repellently elderly. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not considered anything! It\u2019s the new 12!\u201d</p> <p>At 62, Merton looks like a merry, greying, hippie-era John Lennon. He is having cappuccinos in a deserted Bloomsbury hotel, hair straggly, round specs thick and glinting. He wears a charcoal suit and enormously floral shirt presumably bought for TV. In fact, he could have strolled straight off it. Merton surpasses even your most hopeful expectations: funny, friendly, generous, easy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/sep/25/hancock-film-fracas-tale-is-a-work-of-fiction\">Hancock film fracas tale is a work of fiction | Letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, like his hero, there is a residual sense he is a bit dour and depressive, stemming perhaps from an inpatient episode at Maudsley psychiatric hospital around the time he broke through on Whose Line Is It Anyway?. Actually, he says, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/oct/23/comedy.television\" title=\"\">that was down to some dodgy malaria tablets</a> \u2013 his stay extended because staff didn\u2019t believe he actually was on telly every Friday.</p> <p>The smog that surrounds Hancock is harder to shift. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible story to ignore,\u201d says Merton. \u201cThe clown with the tear in his eye; the comedian who makes everybody else laugh but cannot find satisfaction himself.\u201d An easy cliche is media catnip. Merton \u201cloathed\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/21/stan-and-ollie-review-laurel-and-hardy-steve-coogan-john-c-reilly\" title=\"\">Stan &amp; Ollie</a>, last year\u2019s Laurel and Hardy biopic, because \u201cit tried to create drama where there was no real friction.

Years later, Galton met the writer at a party and punched him to the floor. \u201cGood on him!\u201d grins Merton. \u201cThe sheer anger! How dare you do that! Ray and Alan were always grateful and affectionate towards Tony. He\u2019d split his fee with them 50/50. He introduced them to France and wine. When they knew him there was little hint of what was to come. He was a bit of a worrier. But then a lot of comedians can be worriers, particularly if you\u2019re not writing your own material.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s legacy, he thinks, has suffered under a spotlight fixed on his grubbier troubles \u2013 and some unhelpful visuals. \u201cThat famous shot of him wearing the big coat and looking miserable over a cup of tea. That was from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlmZ6_wzaoo\" title=\"\">a programme called The Cold</a>. He\u2019s meant to be ill. Not to look desperately suicidal.\u201d</p> <p>Yet even Merton can\u2019t help having false hindsight. \u201cThere\u2019s that line in The Rebel,\u201d he says with a shiver. \u201c\u2018You\u2019ll be sorry when I\u2019m dead.\u2019 It does rather leap out at you.\u201d</p> <p>Quite why the film was such a disaster across the pond is still a puzzle. After all, Ealing succeeded, despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 its amplified Englishness. Even the Carry Ons had cut through. But something about the bluster and camp indignation of Hancock\u2019s delivery seems to have mistranslated. And there is something peculiarly parochial about the narrative of a frustrated fantasist crashing out of the rat race. There are echoes of Billy Liar in the office scenes; groundwork for Reggie Perrin in the train commute, in which Hancock\u2019s voiceover speculates about his fellow passengers (few Americans travel to work in the same way).</p> <p>When Merton first saw The Rebel in the late 70s, it was during his three-year stint at Tooting Bec employment office in south London. The sequence on the 8:32 to Waterloo struck a special chord. \u201cHancock goes: \u2018Oh, there\u2019s young Reginald. If this train\u2019s still running in 1980, he\u2019ll be on it.\u2019\u201d Merton shudders. \u201cWhen I started at 19, they told me about the pension scheme. Going to the same place every day, doing the same job, filled me with horror.\u201d</p> <p>This is another reason The Rebel might not have hit home in the land of the American dream. Even back in 1961, the notion of ditching a mundane job to try to make it big wasn\u2019t so wild. It might also be what limits its contemporary appreciation, when it is taken as read you should seek artistic fulfilment (and jobs for life are the real pipe-dream).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aea53526b3109a070647cbe58b4683e2119ddb27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aea53526b3109a070647cbe58b4683e2119ddb27/0_184_921_552/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hancock hard at work in The Rebel.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hancock hard at work in The Rebel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the film, George Sanders\u2019 art dealer is unsparing about Hancock\u2019s lack of talent; today, such harsh criticism is a no-no. Whether or not someone actually has any gifts \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be important any more,\u201d says Merton. There are too many channels and \u201cnot that much talent to go around to fill all this space\u201d.</p> <p>He was watching something the other day, he says, that recapped the career highlights of a social media star, \u201cwhich mostly seemed to be combing his hair. I mean, it\u2019s a long way from Sammy Davis Jr! I know we all want to leave our mark, but now there\u2019s millions of them, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s any better than it used to be in terms of standing out from the crowd.\u201d</p> <p>The Rebel is especially sharp on the fallacy of individualism. An existentialists\u2019 party sees them bemoaning the hegemony of office life, while dressed in matching black outfits with identical goatees. Plus \u00e7a change, laughs Merton. \u201cI\u2019m by no means an expert on women\u2019s hair, but I have noticed in the last three or four months this fashion, which I think is great, for pink hair and yellow hair. Everyone\u2019s individual in their own way of doing it, but they\u2019re all doing it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5332c90c62fb6eff28800a424886a42036c38df7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5332c90c62fb6eff28800a424886a42036c38df7/0_563_3128_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Happier times \u2026 Hancock with Margit Saad at the premiere of The Rebel, 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happier times \u2026 Hancock with Margit Saad at the premiere of The Rebel, 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: F Apthorp/Daily Mail/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Merton\u2019s granny-ish lack of savvy is knowingly naive \u2013 and real. He delights in a luddite world (no mobile phone, no email, no idea what Instagram is) not so distant from that inhabited by his hero. Despite his day job, he says he doesn\u2019t follow the news or care for politics. \u201cGive me a story about a parrot that\u2019s learned how to drive and I\u2019m in seventh heaven.\u201d</p> <p>Nor does he watch modern comedy (his most recent reference is The Royle Family), mostly because he\u2019s got an \u201cincredibly good memory for jokes\u201d and worries about accidental plagiarism. When he does catch a bit, he\u2019s rarely impressed. \u201cComedy has coarsened. It\u2019s weak. It\u2019s lazy. I don\u2019t want to sound prudish, and some bodily function jokes can be good. But it\u2019s a shame that if you say \u2018fuck\u2019 in front of an audience, they\u2019ll probably laugh. It\u2019s a shock thing. Any weak punchline can be bolstered by sticking that word in there.\u201d</p> <p>Not that we should rose-tint comedy\u2019s golden age. The Blood Donor contains uncomfortable lines about Hancock\u2019s \u201cundiluted British\u201d blood and how it ought not to be mixed.

      "bodyText": "Seven years before his suicide, Tony Hancock tried to become a movie star. The Rebel (1961) is a comedy about a clerk who quits his job and moves to Paris to become an artist, despite his total lack of talent. Scripted by Half Hour creators Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, it was a deluxe bespoke vehicle, designed to take Hancock across the Atlantic and turn him into the new Peter Sellers. Brits flocked. Homegrown critics raved. And Hollywood absolutely hated it. (\u201cStumbling \u2026 presumptuous \u2026 depressing \u2026 low,\u201d reckoned the New York Times, comparing him unfavourably to Norman Wisdom.) It was the start of the end. The following year, after a final series of Hancock\u2019s Half Hour minus Sid James \u2013 let go lest Hancock be defined only as part of a double act \u2013 Hancock fired Galton and Simpson, too. They then made Steptoe and Son (average audience: 28 million); Hancock made a second bid for international film stardom with a self-scripted feature about a Punch and Judy show in Bognor Regis. \u201cIt\u2019s not a comedy,\u201d grimaces Paul Merton. \u201cDon\u2019t expect any laughs. It\u2019s very bitter.\u201d Merton was six when he went to see it with his mother, who began flinching in the first scene, when Hancock swears at the Lord Mayor. By the time he had \u201ctaken an ornamental pig and shoved a bunch of flowers up its arse, really quite violently\u201d, her fandom was substantially shaken. Now, those two films that kiboshed Hancock\u2019s big-screen dreams \u2013 one wonderful, one sort of awful \u2013 have been restored and rereleased with the heave-ho of Merton, a longtime keeper of the Hancock flame. The Rebel, at least, is a revelation: snappy, surreal, full of satirical horsepower and starring a baby-faced, blue-eyed bon vivant. For those of us familiar only with the black-and-white grump, the effervescence is amazing. Tell Merton this, and delight knocks a decade off him. \u201cRay and Alan always said Hancock seemed to have been born at 40, but in The Rebel he does have the bloom of youth in those cheeks. I think it\u2019s the smooth skin.\u201d Nice clear eyes, too. \u201cYes, wonderful!\u201d he beams. Yet he is still a far cry from 35-year-old leading men today, few of whom have white tufts and dialogue describing themselves as \u201cstout\u201d. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d says Merton. \u201cBut since the early days he was called \u201cTubs\u201d and there was lots of talk about his terrible feet. Comics then were meant to look a bit funny.\u201d Still, when he remade half a dozen Half Hours in 1996 (big ratings, iffy reviews), he says you would never have guessed he and Hancock were the same age at the time of shooting: \u201cIt was to do with the war and with nutrition.\u201d Plus, this was the era of Sgt Pepper, when 64 was repellently elderly. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not considered anything! It\u2019s the new 12!\u201d At 62, Merton looks like a merry, greying, hippie-era John Lennon. He is having cappuccinos in a deserted Bloomsbury hotel, hair straggly, round specs thick and glinting. He wears a charcoal suit and enormously floral shirt presumably bought for TV. In fact, he could have strolled straight off it. Merton surpasses even your most hopeful expectations: funny, friendly, generous, easy. Yet, like his hero, there is a residual sense he is a bit dour and depressive, stemming perhaps from an inpatient episode at Maudsley psychiatric hospital around the time he broke through on Whose Line Is It Anyway?. Actually, he says, that was down to some dodgy malaria tablets \u2013 his stay extended because staff didn\u2019t believe he actually was on telly every Friday. The smog that surrounds Hancock is harder to shift. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible story to ignore,\u201d says Merton. \u201cThe clown with the tear in his eye; the comedian who makes everybody else laugh but cannot find satisfaction himself.\u201d An easy cliche is media catnip. Merton \u201cloathed\u201d Stan &amp; Ollie, last year\u2019s Laurel and Hardy biopic, because \u201cit tried to create drama where there was no real friction. If I\u2019d seen it in a cinema, I\u2019d have been asked to leave. Every 15 minutes, I was like: \u2018Oh, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u2019\u201d Galton and Simpson were, he reports, \u201cjust astonished\u201d by the 1991 Hancock film starring Alfred Molina, which shows them smirking \u201clike the Kray twins\u201d in the back row at his ill-fated 1966 stage comeback. Years later, Galton met the writer at a party and punched him to the floor. \u201cGood on him!\u201d grins Merton. \u201cThe sheer anger! How dare you do that! Ray and Alan were always grateful and affectionate towards Tony. He\u2019d split his fee with them 50/50. He introduced them to France and wine. When they knew him there was little hint of what was to come. He was a bit of a worrier. But then a lot of comedians can be worriers, particularly if you\u2019re not writing your own material.\u201d Hancock\u2019s legacy, he thinks, has suffered under a spotlight fixed on his grubbier troubles \u2013 and some unhelpful visuals. \u201cThat famous shot of him wearing the big coat and looking miserable over a cup of tea. That was from a programme called The Cold. He\u2019s meant to be ill. Not to look desperately suicidal.\u201d Yet even Merton can\u2019t help having false hindsight. \u201cThere\u2019s that line in The Rebel,\u201d he says with a shiver. \u201c\u2018You\u2019ll be sorry when I\u2019m dead.\u2019 It does rather leap out at you.\u201d Quite why the film was such a disaster across the pond is still a puzzle. After all, Ealing succeeded, despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 its amplified Englishness. Even the Carry Ons had cut through. But something about the bluster and camp indignation of Hancock\u2019s delivery seems to have mistranslated. And there is something peculiarly parochial about the narrative of a frustrated fantasist crashing out of the rat race. There are echoes of Billy Liar in the office scenes; groundwork for Reggie Perrin in the train commute, in which Hancock\u2019s voiceover speculates about his fellow passengers (few Americans travel to work in the same way). When Merton first saw The Rebel in the late 70s, it was during his three-year stint at Tooting Bec employment office in south London. The sequence on the 8:32 to Waterloo struck a special chord. \u201cHancock goes: \u2018Oh, there\u2019s young Reginald. If this train\u2019s still running in 1980, he\u2019ll be on it.\u2019\u201d Merton shudders. \u201cWhen I started at 19, they told me about the pension scheme. Going to the same place every day, doing the same job, filled me with horror.\u201d This is another reason The Rebel might not have hit home in the land of the American dream. Even back in 1961, the notion of ditching a mundane job to try to make it big wasn\u2019t so wild. It might also be what limits its contemporary appreciation, when it is taken as read you should seek artistic fulfilment (and jobs for life are the real pipe-dream). In the film, George Sanders\u2019 art dealer is unsparing about Hancock\u2019s lack of talent; today, such harsh criticism is a no-no. Whether or not someone actually has any gifts \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be important any more,\u201d says Merton. There are too many channels and \u201cnot that much talent to go around to fill all this space\u201d. He was watching something the other day, he says, that recapped the career highlights of a social media star, \u201cwhich mostly seemed to be combing his hair. I mean, it\u2019s a long way from Sammy Davis Jr! I know we all want to leave our mark, but now there\u2019s millions of them, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s any better than it used to be in terms of standing out from the crowd.\u201d The Rebel is especially sharp on the fallacy of individualism. An existentialists\u2019 party sees them bemoaning the hegemony of office life, while dressed in matching black outfits with identical goatees. Plus \u00e7a change, laughs Merton. \u201cI\u2019m by no means an expert on women\u2019s hair, but I have noticed in the last three or four months this fashion, which I think is great, for pink hair and yellow hair. Everyone\u2019s individual in their own way of doing it, but they\u2019re all doing it.\u201d Merton\u2019s granny-ish lack of savvy is knowingly naive \u2013 and real. He delights in a luddite world (no mobile phone, no email, no idea what Instagram is) not so distant from that inhabited by his hero. Despite his day job, he says he doesn\u2019t follow the news or care for politics. \u201cGive me a story about a parrot that\u2019s learned how to drive and I\u2019m in seventh heaven.\u201d Nor does he watch modern comedy (his most recent reference is The Royle Family), mostly because he\u2019s got an \u201cincredibly good memory for jokes\u201d and worries about accidental plagiarism. When he does catch a bit, he\u2019s rarely impressed. \u201cComedy has coarsened. It\u2019s weak. It\u2019s lazy. I don\u2019t want to sound prudish, and some bodily function jokes can be good. But it\u2019s a shame that if you say \u2018fuck\u2019 in front of an audience, they\u2019ll probably laugh. It\u2019s a shock thing. Any weak punchline can be bolstered by sticking that word in there.\u201d Not that we should rose-tint comedy\u2019s golden age. The Blood Donor contains uncomfortable lines about Hancock\u2019s \u201cundiluted British\u201d blood and how it ought not to be mixed. The Two Ronnies had \u201cquite a bit of blackface and antisemitism. Stuff which you\u2019d have gone \u2018Ooooh\u2019 at even in 1977.\u201d But Merton doesn\u2019t really want to give anyone a kicking. Comedy is an underrated skill, he says, more so now than ever. It is overlooked for Oscars \u201cbecause comedy undermines the pomposity of calling yourself something like The Academy of Motion Pictures and Science\u201d.

It\u2019s a muggy afternoon, a breeze barely lifting off of the New York Harbor, after days of heavy rain. She maneuvers throngs of tourists, construction workers and suits streaming out of office towers for lunch as she walks north from the waterfront park toward the Brooklyn Bridge.</p> <p>In a skirt suit and flats, Bavishi fits in among lower Manhattan\u2019s workday hustle.

A stench rises from the sidewalks in the summer heat, open garages reveal heaps of auto body parts and cyclists swerve between box trucks that dominate the streets. About 13,000 people live in ageing apartment buildings at the center of this peninsula, lined on either site by heavily industrialized waterfront.</p> <p>Hunts Point residents and activists fought for years to increase access to the waterfront as well as address longstanding environmental issues. More recently they have engaged with the mayor\u2019s office of resiliency, formed in 2014 to oversee New York City\u2019s $20bn portfolio of programs to make the city more resilient to the climate crisis. In Hunts Point, residents reimagined a waterfront that addressed longstanding environmental injustices and poverty that persists in the area.</p> <p>The Hunts Point community spent five years developing a<strong> </strong> plan for protective waterfront infrastructure doubling as public green space, a \u201cLevee Lab\u201d to study resiliency efforts and create local jobs, and a tri-generation plant creating low-carbon cooling and a micro-grid to supply backup power in emergencies.

We have to work with communities to figure out the right solutions for particular neighborhoods.\u201d</p> <p>She points to an inter-agency plan developed in Edgemere, in Rockaway, Queens. Edgemere has been called one of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/13/15280808/climate-change-queens-edgemere-photo-essay&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568987062226000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGafKIzlwrLhpnwFsqmnYsB9yFoUw\" title=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/13/15280808/climate-change-queens-edgemere-photo-essay\">the most neglected neighborhoods</a> in New York City and is particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis because it\u2019s sandwiched between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. During Sandy, flooding from both waterfronts \u2013 one lined with a defunct landfill, the other a city-owned wasteland \u2013 debilitated the neighborhood.</p> <p>\u201cWe were able to engage communities in thinking holistically about what would make their neighborhood more resilient,\u201d Bavishi says. The resulting plan includes buying hurricane-destroyed houses to turn into parks, transit upgrades, raising homes and the shoreline, building a new mixed-use complex and improving the public housing lining the bay.</p> <p>Sonia Moise watched the calm waters of the bay meet the fierce waves of the ocean from her bedroom window in Edgemere the night of Sandy.</p> <p>The promise of Edgemere as a more resilient neighborhood is overshadowed by her seven-year struggle to recover from that day. \u201cThere\u2019s no amount of people who complain like we do about [recovery] work not being done the right way,\u201d she says. \u201cI honestly believe we were treated the absolute worst because of location.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5dd5d746b38774bdb6bcbc1c090f3207efc7fc72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dd5d746b38774bdb6bcbc1c090f3207efc7fc72/0_0_3000_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debris sits on a still-closed beach area damaged by flooding from Hurricane Sandy near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on March 1, 2013 in the Staten Island borough of New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debris sits on a still-closed beach area damaged by flooding from Hurricane Sandy near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island, on 1 March 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside of her three-story home hoisted atop a slab of concrete, she mentioned how long it took to grow backyard grass because the property was built atop rocks and sand. This spring she wrapped a stormproofing renovation, funded by her savings as well as the city\u2019s post-Sandy rebuilding program, <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/content/sandytracker/pages/build-it-back\">Build it Back</a>. But the saga isn\u2019t over: she recently hired a lawyer to dispute the quality of work from Build it Back, which she feels will not sufficiently protect her from the next storm.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to feel we\u2019re safe,\u201d she says of her community\u2019s lingering trauma recovering from Sandy. But there\u2019s a larger threat beyond the next storm: Edgemere will be one of the first New York neighborhoods made uninhabitable by the climate crisis. There\u2019s already a division emerging on Moise\u2019s block: homes with raised elevation \u2013 like her own \u2013 and those still at ground level. \u201cThe people who haven\u2019t raised their houses know they won\u2019t be able to stay,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The city offered to buy Moise\u2019s property following Sandy, but she declined. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the city, that they\u2019d give the money you want for your house,\u201d she says. Would she consider selling if she knew she would get a fair payment? \u201cProbably not,\u201d she says, considering the grievances built up during the recovery process. \u201cI have a disdain for the city.\u201d</p> <p>So Moise will stay, as her neighborhood is both transformed by the climate crisis and the city\u2019s efforts to protect it. On the cusp of such transformation, there\u2019s a quiet, almost eerie atmosphere walking the streets \u2013 even a level of disbelief that Edgemere does, in fact, belong to the same city as lower Manhattan.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p><strong>When </strong><strong>de Blasio announced his ambitious proposal</strong> to expand lower Manhattan, he listed the reasons it was worth saving: home to a half-million jobs, 90,000 residents, the nexus of nearly all the city\u2019s subway lines. He left out that the city and private sector have heavily invested in this neighborhood since the early 1700s, when it emerged as a financial hub, as other waterfronts became places to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/nyregion/how-new-york-citys-coastline-became-home-to-the-poor.html\">house poor New Yorkers</a>, often alongside toxic industrial sites.</p> <p>Bavishi\u2019s goal to holistically address it all is daunting, if not impossible. Funding sources to implement many of the city\u2019s resiliency plans \u2013 including lower Manhattan\u2019s \u2013 are uncertain. Implementation in neighborhoods such as Red Hook has taken longer than residents expected. Crucial city agencies such as the New York City housing authority, which oversees public housing along the floodplain, lack its own vision and funding for resiliency. And, as Tovar mentioned in the resiliency lab, De Blasio still has yet to get on a stage and acknowledge low-income communities are disproportionately burdened by the climate crisis.</p> <p>Bavishi ultimately acknowledges the office of resiliency does not have the capability to address all the longstanding concerns of marginalized communities. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to climate challenges we\u2019re facing and we want to take that seriously,\u201d she tells me over the phone. \u201cWe also want to make sure we\u2019re not raising expectations for other solutions that are out of sync with the resources we have.\u201d</p> <p>So New York is left to see how its most vulnerable residents will survive as the city\u2019s shorelines are transformed<strong> </strong>\u2013 when the ambitious resiliency plans fall through, when stormproofing can\u2019t address day-to-day needs like safer housing.</p> <p>\u201cHaving an exciting, bold vision is not enough,\u201d Tovar says of the Hunts Point resiliency plan, though she could be talking about the rest of the city. \u201cI hope the city comes back to the table to think big and do something unprecedented, because we\u2019re New York City. But how do we encourage them to do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 21 September 2019 to clarify that on the Red Hook resiliency plan, while an early plan under a different mayor never panned out, the city says their newest plan is on time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jainey Bavishi is all business as she takes off from Battery Park to walk the perimeter of lower Manhattan. It\u2019s a muggy afternoon, a breeze barely lifting off of the New York Harbor, after days of heavy rain. She maneuvers throngs of tourists, construction workers and suits streaming out of office towers for lunch as she walks north from the waterfront park toward the Brooklyn Bridge. In a skirt suit and flats, Bavishi fits in among lower Manhattan\u2019s workday hustle. But there\u2019s no one else with a job like hers: director of the New York City\u2019s mayor\u2019s office of resiliency. She is the woman tasked with protecting all 580 miles of New York City shoreline from more frequent and extreme storms and expected sea rise due to the climate crisis. \u201cWe have got a chance to really reimagine the waterfront,\u201d she says, heading underneath FDR Drive past interim flood barriers erected by the city following Hurricane Sandy. There\u2019s an air of promise and forward-thinking in her stride. \u201cI think that\u2019s really exciting,\u201d she exhales. This walk with Bavishi is, in fact, an exercise in imagining: in March, the mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced an ambitious $10bn proposal to extend Manhattan\u2019s southern coastline into the East River as far as 500ft. Bavishi\u2019s walk from Battery Park almost to the Brooklyn Bridge is the roughly one-mile span proposed for expansion. It includes the financial district, sparkling residential towers and the luxury mixed-use community Battery Park City, where a one-bedroom condo is about $1m. Twelve miles north, in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, the waterfront outlines a much different scene. A stench rises from the sidewalks in the summer heat, open garages reveal heaps of auto body parts and cyclists swerve between box trucks that dominate the streets. About 13,000 people live in ageing apartment buildings at the center of this peninsula, lined on either site by heavily industrialized waterfront. Hunts Point residents and activists fought for years to increase access to the waterfront as well as address longstanding environmental issues. More recently they have engaged with the mayor\u2019s office of resiliency, formed in 2014 to oversee New York City\u2019s $20bn portfolio of programs to make the city more resilient to the climate crisis. In Hunts Point, residents reimagined a waterfront that addressed longstanding environmental injustices and poverty that persists in the area. The Hunts Point community spent five years developing a plan for protective waterfront infrastructure doubling as public green space, a \u201cLevee Lab\u201d to study resiliency efforts and create local jobs, and a tri-generation plant creating low-carbon cooling and a micro-grid to supply backup power in emergencies. But around the same time de Blasio introduced his $10bn proposal, the office of resiliency decided it would not fund that plan, due to high cost and because Hunts Points residents do not live in the floodplain. That decision hit this community hard, one of several in New York City finding it can\u2019t face a future of climate change without quality of life issues being addressed first. In preparing for its future, the city would have to confront injustices of its past, and some environmental activists fear the city is not up to the task. The mayor\u2019s office of resiliency set a goal for holistic resiliency planning across the five boroughs, but there\u2019s a lingering question: how does the city enforce waterfront protection for all, when some of it is home to billions of dollars of real estate, infrastructure and investment, and elsewhere it has been neglected for decades? As the climate crisis promises to lay bare the stark disparities of New York City, the answer has never been more pressing. \u2022\u2022\u2022 For the past five years, the environmental activist Angela Tovar has posted flyers, maps, renderings, artwork and a rally poster that reads \u201cPollution Isn\u2019t the Solution\u201d all over the South Bronx Community Resiliency Agenda Lab at the cavernous Hunts Point community hub called the Point. As director of community development at the lab, Tovar is constantly hustling about, running late today because a discussion about the Point\u2019s community-led resiliency plan with the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ran long. \u201cOur work on climate justice started a long time ago,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it came from an understanding that there are a high volume of toxic substances in this area, which is also vulnerable to storm surge.\u201d Tovar points to a large map with about 20 red dots marking the peninsula\u2019s waterfront \u2013 they represent businesses with high volumes of toxic substances. She identifies the residential blocks between the waterfront as an \u201cenvironmental justice community where about half the community lives below the poverty line, and there are really serious public health issues we know will be compounded by climate change.\u201d Tovar then points to a chunk of the peninsula, the entire north-eastern half, occupied by the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, which spans 60 acres and supplies food to the entire north-eastern corridor. \u201cNot only are we talking about a potential threat of storm surge hitting an environmental justice community, and hitting businesses with toxic chemicals, we are talking about how that would impact the food distribution center,\u201d she says. Hurricane Sandy prompted the office of resiliency to focus its attention on protecting the food distribution center. Meanwhile, community organizers like Tovar had already been advocating for the city to also take stock of the poverty, isolation and longstanding environmental injustices across the peninsula. The office of resiliency ultimately decided to focus on strengthening buildings inside the food distribution center instead of moving ahead on a comprehensive waterfront resiliency plan. (Bavishi says the decision was made because the Hunts Point\u2019s residential community is not located in the floodplain.) Her voice strains and head shakes recalling how that news came around the same time de Blasio announced his $10bn investment in building new land in lower Manhattan. \u201cIt felt like a tremendous slap in the face, to be honest,\u201d she says. Tovar acknowledges that the $10bn is far from secured, but points out the South Bronx lacks even a promise of funding. \u201cAll we\u2019re saying is make that same commitment to the most vulnerable communities in New York City,\u201d she says. \u201cGet up on stage, make that commitment and say: \u2018Low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately burdened by climate change.\u2019\u201d Local activists have moved ahead on smaller projects with more modest amounts of city funding, such as launching a community wifi network resistant to power and internet outages. The Point also runs the Be a Buddy program, which is building a network of local volunteers who learn how to provide resources, aid and immediate support during climate emergencies like heatwaves or storms. \u201cWe just have to continue to move on our own,\u201d Tovar says, with a hint of defeat in her voice. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In another borough on another waterfront, another underserved community has come up with their own program to train residents to help one another. It\u2019s called Local Leaders and is a 10-week emergency preparedness training run by the not-for-profit Red Hook Initiative (RHI) out of a converted warehouse a few blocks from the Gowanus Expressway, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Unlike the South Bronx, Hurricane Sandy devastated Red Hook, transforming RHI into de facto recovery headquarters. The thousands of residents seeking help were primarily public housing residents \u2013 this neighborhood has the second highest concentration in the city. Red Hook embodies perhaps the greatest challenge facing New York as it braces for the climate crisis: nearly one-fifth of all housing units within New York\u2019s floodplain are public housing, and the city\u2019s public housing agency struggles to provide even basic services to residents. Tevina Willis moved into the sprawling public housing complex about a decade ago. During Sandy, she and her neighbors ran up and down stairs, hauling water and spreading information about available resources. She was one of the first graduates of Local Leaders after RHI initiated it in 2013 to empower residents with emergency preparedness tactics such as CPR and conflict resolution; now she facilitates incoming groups. \u201cLocal Leaders further connected me to my neighbors,\u201d Willis says, \u201cAnd it took off from there.\u201d During an August block party hosted by RHI, a conversation with Willis about resiliency kept returning to housing. \u201cOur electricity constantly goes out, every other day there\u2019s an electrical fire in someone\u2019s apartment,\u201d she details over pop and rap music blasting from the DJ booth. \u201cA lot of our tenants experience gas outages.\u201d She points to a resident who recently went without gas for six months. Willis is helping spearhead the next phase for trained Local Leaders: \u201ca social justice and community organizing campaign to fight for policy change\u201d with a focus on improving public housing. \u201cWe need resiliency inside our apartments,\u201d she says. On a quieter day, RHI\u2019s chief strategy officer, Javier Lopez, spoke about the larger resiliency vision for the neighborhood. While the city has installed some interim flood protections since Sandy, a larger plan to install floodwalls, raise streets and improve drainage to protect housing has yet to be implemented.

He spoke of a divide between low-income, marginalized residents and the scientific, architectural and urban planning community advancing resiliency plans. \u201cSometimes we walk into these meetings and the architects and scientists are coming in at a 10, and we\u2019re at a two,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one from the resiliency world has had the awareness to take into account that neighborhoods have faced structural racism and various forms of disinvestment,\u201d he continues. \u201cThere are voices missing, there are areas of concern, there hasn\u2019t been a restoration of what was lost since Sandy.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Along our lower Manhattan walk, and again in a quick telephone conversation, I ask Bavishi how she weighs the needs of different waterfront communities in resiliency planning. \u201cAn incredible amount of community engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cOur goal is to be thoughtful and inclusive, recognizing there is no silver bullet and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. We have to work with communities to figure out the right solutions for particular neighborhoods.\u201d She points to an inter-agency plan developed in Edgemere, in Rockaway, Queens. Edgemere has been called one of the most neglected neighborhoods in New York City and is particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis because it\u2019s sandwiched between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. During Sandy, flooding from both waterfronts \u2013 one lined with a defunct landfill, the other a city-owned wasteland \u2013 debilitated the neighborhood. \u201cWe were able to engage communities in thinking holistically about what would make their neighborhood more resilient,\u201d Bavishi says. The resulting plan includes buying hurricane-destroyed houses to turn into parks, transit upgrades, raising homes and the shoreline, building a new mixed-use complex and improving the public housing lining the bay. Sonia Moise watched the calm waters of the bay meet the fierce waves of the ocean from her bedroom window in Edgemere the night of Sandy. The promise of Edgemere as a more resilient neighborhood is overshadowed by her seven-year struggle to recover from that day. \u201cThere\u2019s no amount of people who complain like we do about [recovery] work not being done the right way,\u201d she says. \u201cI honestly believe we were treated the absolute worst because of location.\u201d Outside of her three-story home hoisted atop a slab of concrete, she mentioned how long it took to grow backyard grass because the property was built atop rocks and sand. This spring she wrapped a stormproofing renovation, funded by her savings as well as the city\u2019s post-Sandy rebuilding program, Build it Back. But the saga isn\u2019t over: she recently hired a lawyer to dispute the quality of work from Build it Back, which she feels will not sufficiently protect her from the next storm. \u201cWe need to feel we\u2019re safe,\u201d she says of her community\u2019s lingering trauma recovering from Sandy. But there\u2019s a larger threat beyond the next storm: Edgemere will be one of the first New York neighborhoods made uninhabitable by the climate crisis. There\u2019s already a division emerging on Moise\u2019s block: homes with raised elevation \u2013 like her own \u2013 and those still at ground level. \u201cThe people who haven\u2019t raised their houses know they won\u2019t be able to stay,\u201d she says. The city offered to buy Moise\u2019s property following Sandy, but she declined. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the city, that they\u2019d give the money you want for your house,\u201d she says. Would she consider selling if she knew she would get a fair payment? \u201cProbably not,\u201d she says, considering the grievances built up during the recovery process. \u201cI have a disdain for the city.\u201d So Moise will stay, as her neighborhood is both transformed by the climate crisis and the city\u2019s efforts to protect it. On the cusp of such transformation, there\u2019s a quiet, almost eerie atmosphere walking the streets \u2013 even a level of disbelief that Edgemere does, in fact, belong to the same city as lower Manhattan. \u2022\u2022\u2022 When de Blasio announced his ambitious proposal to expand lower Manhattan, he listed the reasons it was worth saving: home to a half-million jobs, 90,000 residents, the nexus of nearly all the city\u2019s subway lines. He left out that the city and private sector have heavily invested in this neighborhood since the early 1700s, when it emerged as a financial hub, as other waterfronts became places to house poor New Yorkers, often alongside toxic industrial sites. Bavishi\u2019s goal to holistically address it all is daunting, if not impossible. Funding sources to implement many of the city\u2019s resiliency plans \u2013 including lower Manhattan\u2019s \u2013 are uncertain. Implementation in neighborhoods such as Red Hook has taken longer than residents expected. Crucial city agencies such as the New York City housing authority, which oversees public housing along the floodplain, lack its own vision and funding for resiliency. And, as Tovar mentioned in the resiliency lab, De Blasio still has yet to get on a stage and acknowledge low-income communities are disproportionately burdened by the climate crisis. Bavishi ultimately acknowledges the office of resiliency does not have the capability to address all the longstanding concerns of marginalized communities. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to climate challenges we\u2019re facing and we want to take that seriously,\u201d she tells me over the phone. \u201cWe also want to make sure we\u2019re not raising expectations for other solutions that are out of sync with the resources we have.\u201d So New York is left to see how its most vulnerable residents will survive as the city\u2019s shorelines are transformed \u2013 when the ambitious resiliency plans fall through, when stormproofing can\u2019t address day-to-day needs like safer housing. \u201cHaving an exciting, bold vision is not enough,\u201d Tovar says of the Hunts Point resiliency plan, though she could be talking about the rest of the city. \u201cI hope the city comes back to the table to think big and do something unprecedented, because we\u2019re New York City. But how do we encourage them to do that?\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on 21 September 2019 to clarify that on the Red Hook resiliency plan, while an early plan under a different mayor never panned out, the city says their newest plan is on time.",

Modi profited from an exuberant consensus about India among Anglo-American elites: that democracy had acquired deep roots in Indian soil, fertilising it for the growth of free markets. </p> <p>As chief minister of the state of Gujarat in 2002, Modi was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13170914\" title=\"\">suspected of a crucial role</a> \u2013 ranging from malign inaction to watchful complicity \u2013 in an anti-Muslim pogrom of gruesome violence. The US and the European Union denied Modi a visa for several years. </p> <p>But his record was suddenly forgotten as Modi ascended, with the help of India\u2019s richest businessmen, to power. \u201cThere is something thrilling about the rise of Narendra Modi,\u201d Gideon Rachman, the chief foreign affairs columnist for the Financial Times, <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/\" title=\"\">wrote in April 2014</a>.

But it has gone almost wholly unremarked in mainstream circles partly because democratic and free-marketeering India was the great non-white hope of the ideological children of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher who still dominate our discourse: India was a gilded oriental mirror in which they could cherish themselves.</p> <p>This moral vanity explains how even sentinels of the supposedly reasonable centre, such as Obama and the Financial Times, came to condone demagoguery abroad \u2013 and, more importantly, how they failed to anticipate its eruption at home.</p> <p>Even the most fleeting glance at history shows that the contradiction Ambedkar identified in India \u2013 which enabled Modi\u2019s rise \u2013 has long bedevilled the emancipatory promise of democratic equality. In 1909, Max Weber asked: \u201cHow are freedom and democracy in the long run at all possible under the domination of highly developed capitalism?\u201d</p> <p>The decades of atrocity that followed answered Weber\u2019s question with a grisly spectacle. The fraught and extremely limited western experiment with democracy did better only after social-welfarism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education\" title=\"\">widely adopted after 1945</a>, emerged to defang capitalism, and meet halfway the formidable old challenge of inequality. But the rule of <em>demos</em> still seemed remote.</p> <p>The Cambridge political theorist John Dunn was <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vw3tKOTVG0AC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">complaining as early as 1979</a> that while democratic theory had become the \u201cpublic cant of the modern world\u201d, democratic reality had grown \u201cpretty thin on the ground\u201d. Since then, that reality has grown flimsier, corroded by a financialised mode of capitalism that has held Anglo-American politicians and journalists in its thrall since the 1980s.</p> <p>What went unnoticed until recently was that the chasm between a political system that promises formal equality and a socio-economic system that generates intolerable inequality had grown much wider. It eventually empowered the demagogues who now rule us. In other words, modern democracies have for decades been lurching towards moral and ideological bankruptcy \u2013 unprepared by their own publicists to cope with the political and environmental disasters that unregulated capitalism ceaselessly inflicts, even on such winners of history as Britain and the US.</p> <p>Having laboured to exclude a smelly past of ethnocide, slavery and racism \u2013 and the ongoing stink of corporate venality \u2013 from their perfumed notion of Anglo-American superiority, the promoters of democracy have no nose for its true enemies. Ripe for superannuation but still entrenched on the heights of politics and journalism, they repetitively ventilate their rage and frustration, or whinge incessantly about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/10/millennials-censorship-putney-sofka-zinovieff-lolita\" title=\"\">cancel culture</a>\u201d and the \u201cradical left\u201d, it is because that is all they can do. Their own mind-numbing simplicities about democracy, its enemies, friends, the free world, and all that sort of thing, have doomed them to experience the contemporary world as an endless series of shocks and debacles.</p> <p>\u2022 Pankaj Mishra is an Indian author and writer of literary and political essays.

The US and the European Union denied Modi a visa for several years. But his record was suddenly forgotten as Modi ascended, with the help of India\u2019s richest businessmen, to power. \u201cThere is something thrilling about the rise of Narendra Modi,\u201d Gideon Rachman, the chief foreign affairs columnist for the Financial Times, wrote in April 2014. Rupert Murdoch, of course, anointed Modi as India\u2019s \u201cbest leader with best policies since independence\u201d. But Barack Obama also chose to hail Modi for reflecting \u201cthe dynamism and potential of India\u2019s rise\u201d. As Modi arrived in Silicon Valley in 2015 \u2013 just as his government was shutting down the internet in Kashmir \u2013 Sheryl Sandberg declared she was changing her Facebook profile in order to honour the Indian leader. In the next few days, Modi will address thousands of affluent Indian-Americans in the company of Trump in Houston, Texas. While his government builds detention camps for hundreds of thousands Muslims it has abruptly rendered stateless, he will receive a commendation from Bill Gates for building toilets. The fawning by Western politicians, businessmen, and journalists over a man credibly accused of complicity in a mass murder is a much bigger scandal than Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s donations to MIT. But it has gone almost wholly unremarked in mainstream circles partly because democratic and free-marketeering India was the great non-white hope of the ideological children of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher who still dominate our discourse: India was a gilded oriental mirror in which they could cherish themselves. This moral vanity explains how even sentinels of the supposedly reasonable centre, such as Obama and the Financial Times, came to condone demagoguery abroad \u2013 and, more importantly, how they failed to anticipate its eruption at home. Even the most fleeting glance at history shows that the contradiction Ambedkar identified in India \u2013 which enabled Modi\u2019s rise \u2013 has long bedevilled the emancipatory promise of democratic equality. In 1909, Max Weber asked: \u201cHow are freedom and democracy in the long run at all possible under the domination of highly developed capitalism?\u201d The decades of atrocity that followed answered Weber\u2019s question with a grisly spectacle. The fraught and extremely limited western experiment with democracy did better only after social-welfarism, widely adopted after 1945, emerged to defang capitalism, and meet halfway the formidable old challenge of inequality. But the rule of demos still seemed remote. The Cambridge political theorist John Dunn was complaining as early as 1979 that while democratic theory had become the \u201cpublic cant of the modern world\u201d, democratic reality had grown \u201cpretty thin on the ground\u201d. Since then, that reality has grown flimsier, corroded by a financialised mode of capitalism that has held Anglo-American politicians and journalists in its thrall since the 1980s. What went unnoticed until recently was that the chasm between a political system that promises formal equality and a socio-economic system that generates intolerable inequality had grown much wider. It eventually empowered the demagogues who now rule us. In other words, modern democracies have for decades been lurching towards moral and ideological bankruptcy \u2013 unprepared by their own publicists to cope with the political and environmental disasters that unregulated capitalism ceaselessly inflicts, even on such winners of history as Britain and the US. Having laboured to exclude a smelly past of ethnocide, slavery and racism \u2013 and the ongoing stink of corporate venality \u2013 from their perfumed notion of Anglo-American superiority, the promoters of democracy have no nose for its true enemies. Ripe for superannuation but still entrenched on the heights of politics and journalism, they repetitively ventilate their rage and frustration, or whinge incessantly about \u201ccancel culture\u201d and the \u201cradical left\u201d, it is because that is all they can do. Their own mind-numbing simplicities about democracy, its enemies, friends, the free world, and all that sort of thing, have doomed them to experience the contemporary world as an endless series of shocks and debacles. \u2022 Pankaj Mishra is an Indian author and writer of literary and political essays.

      "bodyText": "Until a few months ago I never imagined blocking a bridge and watching grandparents being carried off by police. Yet last weekend I was one of hundreds of Extinction Rebellion (XR for short) protesters who danced, sang and chanted on Princes bridge in Melbourne for several hours to draw attention to the climate crisis. The people who chose to be arrested (the police gave protesters plenty of warning and time to move on) included an assistant school principal, a clinical psychologist, a permaculturalist and a 73-year-old grandmother. These are not the sort of activities I envisioned doing at this point in my life. In the words of that Powderfinger song, these days turned out nothing like I had planned. Then again, few people predicted the world would end up the way it has \u2013 other than climate scientists, of course, whose warnings have been ignored for decades.

That is a terribly sad feeling, but nothing compared to what many of our greatest minds are telling us will occur if drastic measures are not taken: food shortages and mass starvation, a climate apartheid, the displacement and deaths of hundreds of millions of people, the continued destruction of the natural world, and the potential collapse of human civilisation.

A Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman said that the decision of the US Federal Aviation Administration would be an important factor in deciding whether to allow the Max to fly, but Casa would also take into account other information before making its decision. \u201cAs the certifying authority for the aircraft type, obviously the FAA is central to the decision as to whether the aircraft flies or not but in this case due to the nature of it there is focus on the aircraft from authorities around the world,\u201d the spokesman said. He said Casa had been sharing information with other regulators including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the Canadian regulator, Transport Canada, both of which have said they will do their own assessments of the Max. \u201cThose views will form part of our thinking when we make a decision,\u201d he said. He said there was no set timeframe in which Casa would make its call. National aviation safety bodies usually accept the decision of a manufacturer\u2019s home regulator \u2013 in this case the FAA \u2013 but the deadly Max crashes have raised concerns the US authority failed to properly oversee Boeing. Global air safety authorities, including Casa, are due to meet on Monday in Montreal to discuss the Max issue at a meeting called by the FAA. No Australian airlines currently fly the Max, but Virgin has 48 on order and Qantas has also expressed interest in buying the plane. Until Casa banned the planes from flying on 13 March it was used by on flights in and out of Australia by two overseas airlines, Fiji Airways and Singapore\u2019s SilkAir. The Max, which was Boeing\u2019s fastest-selling model, was attractive to airlines because it has larger engines than the standard 737, giving it a longer range and greater capacity. But the planes were grounded in March after Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second lethal Max crash in six months. In October 2018, a Lion Air flight from Jakarta to Bangka Island plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew. The day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash the FAA defended the airworthiness of the Max, but within two days it was forced to ground the fleet by Donald Trump. Investigations have focused on an automated system that under some circumstances can compensate for the extra lift generated by the bigger engines by pushing the nose of the plane down. The crashes have also raised concerns that engineering quality at Boeing may have suffered as the company pursued profits in competition with its European rival, Airbus. In early April, the FAA set up a joint technical review team with other aviation authorities, including Europe\u2019s Easa and Australia\u2019s Casa. A fortnight ago, the FAA said the team was \u201ctaking additional time to finish documenting its work\u201d. \u201cWe expect the group to submit its observations, findings, and recommendations in the coming weeks,\u201d it said.",

We were having a really friendly time and they asked me what\u2019s in it and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a $5,000 dress \u2013 we can\u2019t crush it up.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But the Oz\u2019s Margin Call painted the friendly exchange as the former breakfast TV host being \u201cupset with the Qantas crew\u2019s treatment of her ball gown\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt pays to be discreet on a plane stuffed full with media, politicians and lobbyists headed for the capital for the political class\u2019s social night of the year.\u201d</p> <p>After Trioli complained the paper published a mea culpa of sorts, with the headline proclaiming \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/margin-call/dress-stress-nothing-to-shout-about/news-story/abea0782df741b462c461ea8b5e9d073\">Virginia Trioli\u2019s Midwinter Ball dress</a> stress nothing to shout about\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut let the record show the ABC host did not shout: \u2018This is a $5,000 dress!\u2019 Trioli doesn\u2019t shout.

When questions were raised last year about why she didn\u2019t win the 2018 award for her Barnaby Joyce love child scoop, the National Press Club said it had not received her entry \u2013 even though Markson said she had entered. This year it made it up to her. Luckily Speers and Markson didn\u2019t have to split the $5,000 prize money because Qantas coughed up $5,000 for both winners.</p> <p>But the award-winning Daily Telegraph political editor may not be sticking around on the Sydney tabloid for much longer. Markson is said to be unhappy at the Tele and is likely to return to the Australian under her good friend Chris Dore, who is on a bit of a hiring spree. Dore has already brought back another former Oz journo, Natasha Robinson, who spent four years at the ABC as education reporter and has returned to the fold as health editor.</p> <h2><strong>Speers signs off</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/23/david-speers-barrie-cassidy-sky-abc-insiders-host\">David Speers\u2019 departure from the Murdoch empire</a> is coming sooner than we expected. Although the star broadcaster is contracted to Sky News until the end of the year, and its chief executive, Paul Whittaker, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/05/david-speers-wont-start-at-abc-until-2020-after-sky-insists-he-serve-out-contract\">not going to grant him an early mark,</a> Speers will disappear within a matter of weeks, sources say. With annual leave banked up he will exit stage left and enjoy several months off before taking over as Insiders host at the ABC in 2020. It is yet to emerge whether Sky will let him slip quietly away or celebrate his career on screen.</p> <h2><strong>PM v PVO</strong></h2> <p>One journo who definitely wasn\u2019t a winner at the Midwinter Ball was Ten\u2019s political editor, Peter van Onselen. PVO, as he is known, was the butt of the prime minister\u2019s running joke and he didn\u2019t take it well. After Scott Morrison punctuated his speech with a recording of PVO claiming that the Liberals would certainly lose the election, he got even by tweeting out screenshots of what appeared to be private texts with the prime minister\u2019s office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/vanOnselenP/status/1174307547303383040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is how the PMs office deal with the media <a href=\"https://t.co/F7MAIJx3Xe\">pic.twitter.com/F7MAIJx3Xe</a></p>&mdash; Peter van Onselen (@vanOnselenP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanOnselenP/status/1174307547303383040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It was unfortunate timing for both parties because the Ten journalist was part of the press pack traveling with the PM to the US on Thursday. But PVO didn\u2019t let the close quarters stop him, and he continued to criticise the prime minister, the handling of the trip, the transport and even the staged events in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/vanOnselenP/status/1174481003311554561\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This new plane of the PM really is a hunk of junk....</p>&mdash; Peter van Onselen (@vanOnselenP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanOnselenP/status/1174481003311554561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 19, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Daily Telegraph jumped to the PM\u2019s defence, scolding the journalist for failing to recognise the safety benefits of the new prime ministerial transport.</p> <h2><strong>Fitzy business</strong></h2> <p>Even his mates would describe Peter FitzSimons as a brash, confident self-promoter. A big-name journo at the Sydney Morning Herald, the former Wallaby is also the author of dozens of bestselling non-fiction books. So what was he going to talk about when he launched his colleague Kate McClymont\u2019s book this week other than his own books?</p> <p>Fitzy was on the podium at Gleebooks launching the star investigative journalist\u2019s latest book, Dead Man Walking, about the shady business deals of Michael McGurk and Ron Medich.</p> <p>But when he got up to introduce McClymont there were a few elbows in ribs because he spent the first few minutes talking about two of his own books \u2013 about the second world war secret agent Nancy Wake and the former Labor leader Kim Beazley \u2013 and incidents at his own book launches. But they were there to celebrate Kate and her investigative skills, he finally said, before throwing to McClymont and the broadcaster Philip Clark, who conducted a Q&amp;A strictly confined to her book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MargotSaville/status/1173879903797645316\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peter_Fitz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Peter_Fitz</a>\u2069 launching \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kate_McClymont?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Kate_McClymont</a>\u2069&#39;s book, Dead Man Walking <a href=\"https://t.co/Xvd4F4endv\">pic.twitter.com/Xvd4F4endv</a></p>&mdash; Margot Saville (@MargotSaville) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MargotSaville/status/1173879903797645316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Michael Millett remembered</h2> <p>Three ABC managing directors, two ABC chairs and dozens of ABC executives, staff and journalists attended the funeral of the broadcaster\u2019s communications director Michael Millett, 60, on Tuesday. The current ABC managing director, David Anderson, was accompanied by news executives Gaven Morris and John Lyons, and the Media Watch host Paul Barry, in remembering the life and career of the straight-talking Melbourne-born journalist.</p> <p>The master of ceremonies was the former ABC managing director Mark Scott, who worked with Millett at the Sydney Morning Herald before handpicking him to be his right-hand man at Aunty for his two five-year tenures. Millett was a passionate defender of the public broadcaster and press freedoms and was never bowed by authority, casually putting his feet on the coffee table in ministerial offices, we heard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCMediaComms/status/1171240428722458625\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For all who knew him, a message from Mick Millett\u2019s son Dylan: <a href=\"https://t.co/VU0L3iXC7C\">pic.twitter.com/VU0L3iXC7C</a></p>&mdash; ABC Communications (@ABCMediaComms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCMediaComms/status/1171240428722458625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Scott, a close friend of Millett\u2019s, did a masterful job weaving together Millett\u2019s four-decade media career, which began at the Herald Sun when he was straight out of school, with his equally impressive family life with his wife, Deb, and kids Dylan and Shayne.</p> <p>The former ABC managing director Michelle Guthrie was among the mourners, in a rare appearance at a media-heavy function. The ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and the former ABC chair Maurice Newman packed into the chapel, alongside the ABC veterans Marian Wilkinson, Quentin Dempster and Jim Middleton, the former SMH editors Milton Cockburn, Amanda Wilson and Darren Goodsir, and dozens of journalists who had worked with Mick over the years.</p> <h2><strong>Cigars and Fox News</strong></h2> <p>As the Australian media climbed off the plane in Washington for Scott Morrison\u2019s state visit, which includes a state dinner at the White House hosted by Donald Trump, it was good to see the Sky News host Paul Murray is already well settled into Washington and enjoying the company of his Fox News colleagues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2eCUJVgGuR/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "The Australian never wastes an opportunity to attack the ABC, so it was no surprise when a gossip column claimed that an unnamed ABC presenter \u2013 subsequently revealed to be Virginia Trioli \u2013 is a diva who shouted at Qantas flight attendants about stowing her gown for the Midwinter Ball. \u201cI\u2019ve been criticised for decades by the Australian and I am always prepared to cop it because I believe if you dish it you should always be prepared to take it \u2013 but I am not going to be hung for something that I did not do,\u201d Trioli told Weekly Beast. \u201cIt just absolutely did not happen. I had an overlong suit bag and the attendants helped me find somewhere to put it. We were having a really friendly time and they asked me what\u2019s in it and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a $5,000 dress \u2013 we can\u2019t crush it up.\u2019\u201d But the Oz\u2019s Margin Call painted the friendly exchange as the former breakfast TV host being \u201cupset with the Qantas crew\u2019s treatment of her ball gown\u201d. \u201cIt pays to be discreet on a plane stuffed full with media, politicians and lobbyists headed for the capital for the political class\u2019s social night of the year.\u201d After Trioli complained the paper published a mea culpa of sorts, with the headline proclaiming \u201cVirginia Trioli\u2019s Midwinter Ball dress stress nothing to shout about\u201d. \u201cBut let the record show the ABC host did not shout: \u2018This is a $5,000 dress!\u2019 Trioli doesn\u2019t shout. Rather, she politely said: \u2018This is a $5,000 dress!\u2019 \u201d Trioli: \u201cThe attendants had a jolly old girly time looking at photographs of the dress on my phone. So for me to be misrepresented that way and, worse, for them to be misrepresented when they were so charming really pisses me off. \u201cBeat me up for what I say on air but I am not going to be represented as someone who shouts at attendants. If you shout on a plane you get kicked off and I don\u2019t shout at people.\u201d Trioli takes over from Jon Faine in Melbourne on 14 October. Markson\u2019s next move? David Speers and Sharri Markson were jointly awarded press gallery journalist of the year at the ball, after the latter was widely believed to have been robbed of last year\u2019s gong. When questions were raised last year about why she didn\u2019t win the 2018 award for her Barnaby Joyce love child scoop, the National Press Club said it had not received her entry \u2013 even though Markson said she had entered. This year it made it up to her. Luckily Speers and Markson didn\u2019t have to split the $5,000 prize money because Qantas coughed up $5,000 for both winners. But the award-winning Daily Telegraph political editor may not be sticking around on the Sydney tabloid for much longer. Markson is said to be unhappy at the Tele and is likely to return to the Australian under her good friend Chris Dore, who is on a bit of a hiring spree. Dore has already brought back another former Oz journo, Natasha Robinson, who spent four years at the ABC as education reporter and has returned to the fold as health editor. Speers signs off David Speers\u2019 departure from the Murdoch empire is coming sooner than we expected. Although the star broadcaster is contracted to Sky News until the end of the year, and its chief executive, Paul Whittaker, was not going to grant him an early mark, Speers will disappear within a matter of weeks, sources say. With annual leave banked up he will exit stage left and enjoy several months off before taking over as Insiders host at the ABC in 2020. It is yet to emerge whether Sky will let him slip quietly away or celebrate his career on screen. PM v PVO One journo who definitely wasn\u2019t a winner at the Midwinter Ball was Ten\u2019s political editor, Peter van Onselen. PVO, as he is known, was the butt of the prime minister\u2019s running joke and he didn\u2019t take it well. After Scott Morrison punctuated his speech with a recording of PVO claiming that the Liberals would certainly lose the election, he got even by tweeting out screenshots of what appeared to be private texts with the prime minister\u2019s office. It was unfortunate timing for both parties because the Ten journalist was part of the press pack traveling with the PM to the US on Thursday. But PVO didn\u2019t let the close quarters stop him, and he continued to criticise the prime minister, the handling of the trip, the transport and even the staged events in the US. The Daily Telegraph jumped to the PM\u2019s defence, scolding the journalist for failing to recognise the safety benefits of the new prime ministerial transport. Fitzy business Even his mates would describe Peter FitzSimons as a brash, confident self-promoter. A big-name journo at the Sydney Morning Herald, the former Wallaby is also the author of dozens of bestselling non-fiction books. So what was he going to talk about when he launched his colleague Kate McClymont\u2019s book this week other than his own books? Fitzy was on the podium at Gleebooks launching the star investigative journalist\u2019s latest book, Dead Man Walking, about the shady business deals of Michael McGurk and Ron Medich. But when he got up to introduce McClymont there were a few elbows in ribs because he spent the first few minutes talking about two of his own books \u2013 about the second world war secret agent Nancy Wake and the former Labor leader Kim Beazley \u2013 and incidents at his own book launches. But they were there to celebrate Kate and her investigative skills, he finally said, before throwing to McClymont and the broadcaster Philip Clark, who conducted a Q&amp;A strictly confined to her book. Michael Millett remembered Three ABC managing directors, two ABC chairs and dozens of ABC executives, staff and journalists attended the funeral of the broadcaster\u2019s communications director Michael Millett, 60, on Tuesday. The current ABC managing director, David Anderson, was accompanied by news executives Gaven Morris and John Lyons, and the Media Watch host Paul Barry, in remembering the life and career of the straight-talking Melbourne-born journalist. The master of ceremonies was the former ABC managing director Mark Scott, who worked with Millett at the Sydney Morning Herald before handpicking him to be his right-hand man at Aunty for his two five-year tenures. Millett was a passionate defender of the public broadcaster and press freedoms and was never bowed by authority, casually putting his feet on the coffee table in ministerial offices, we heard. Scott, a close friend of Millett\u2019s, did a masterful job weaving together Millett\u2019s four-decade media career, which began at the Herald Sun when he was straight out of school, with his equally impressive family life with his wife, Deb, and kids Dylan and Shayne. The former ABC managing director Michelle Guthrie was among the mourners, in a rare appearance at a media-heavy function. The ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and the former ABC chair Maurice Newman packed into the chapel, alongside the ABC veterans Marian Wilkinson, Quentin Dempster and Jim Middleton, the former SMH editors Milton Cockburn, Amanda Wilson and Darren Goodsir, and dozens of journalists who had worked with Mick over the years. Cigars and Fox News As the Australian media climbed off the plane in Washington for Scott Morrison\u2019s state visit, which includes a state dinner at the White House hosted by Donald Trump, it was good to see the Sky News host Paul Murray is already well settled into Washington and enjoying the company of his Fox News colleagues. Murray posted on Instagram that he was \u201cliving the dream\u201d in the US, broadcasting live from the Fox News roof in Washington, smoking cigars and chatting with a \u201cgreat bloke\u201d, Joe Hockey.",

Spotting the flag emblazoned on a miniature rugby ball in the Guardian\u2019s basket, she quickly adds: \u201cThe England shirts are selling really well, too.\u201d The warm and sustained blast of omotenashi hospitality directed at visiting teams and their supporters this week in Japan has almost made it possible to forget that much of the tournament\u2019s success will depend on the hosts, who begin their campaign in the opening fixture against Russia on Friday in front of a TV audience organisers say could reach 40 million \u2013 just under a third of the country\u2019s population. The Welsh squad were serenaded with a rousing rendition of Land of My Fathers by 15,000 people at a training session; the All Blacks have been treated to enough displays of the haka to sustain them during the next six weeks of rugby; and an ear-splitting performance of taiko drumming should have blown away any post-flight cobwebs among the English contingent. As it prepares for the opening fixture, the stakes could hardly be higher for Japan, both as a team and host of the first World Cup to be held in Asia. World Rugby had already taken a gamble a decade ago when it awarded the 2019 event to Japan, whose long association with the sport has never been matched by its achievements in the international arena. Before the last tournament in 2015, hosted by England, the Brave Blossoms had only ever won one World Cup match, against Zimbabwe in 1991, and lost every other by an average of 48 points, including a crushing 145-17 defeat at the hands of the All Blacks in 1995. Japanese rugby didn\u2019t properly announce its arrival as a serious international proposition until 2015 when Eddie Jones\u2019s men became the first team in World Cup history to win three matches yet fail to advance to the knockout stages. Those victories included an astonishing 34-32 defeat of South Africa in Brighton. Four years on, it seems incredible to recall that the match wasn\u2019t shown on terrestrial TV in Japan. What happened next should calm any 11th-hour nerves over how much domestic interest the 2019 incarnation will generate. Having been denied live coverage of the Springboks shock, Japanese TV viewers set a tournament record, with 25 million watching the team\u2019s next match, a 26-5 win over Samoa. After years of struggling to emerge from the shadow of next summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, the World Cup has finally penetrated the public consciousness. Almost all of the 1.8m tickets have been sold, with the organising committee president, Fujio Mitarai, confidently predicting that all 48 games will be played in packed stadiums. The 12 match venues have been shared among rugby heartlands in Kamaishi and Osaka, but also cities where the sport barely registered a couple of years ago. Officials say they are hoping two matches in Sapporo this weekend, including England v Tonga, generate 4.7bn yen ( \u00a335m) in revenue, as 80,000 of an expected total of more than 400,000 overseas fans descend on the tournament\u2019s northernmost venue. The World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, believes a \u201cflame has been lit\u201d with the arrival of the World Cup in Japan. \u201cInterest is phenomenal and more young people in Japan are getting into rugby than ever before,\u201d he said on the eve of the tournament. Bu the groundswell of grassroots support for rugby \u2013 Japan\u2019s third sport behind professional baseball and football \u2013 could easily give way to apathy if the host side\u2019s performances fall short of rising public expectations. Few believe that Jamie Joseph\u2019s men \u2013 Japanese sport\u2019s latest challenge to the notion of a racially homogenous society \u2013 can do anything other than put Russia, currently ranked 20th in the world, to the sword at Tokyo Stadium on Friday. But if their tournament evaporates as quickly as beer fumes on a balmy autumn evening against Pool A opponents Ireland, Scotland and Samoa, the resulting drop-off in local interest will frustrate the vision of World Rugby officials \u2013 to spread the rugby gospel across Asia and tap into a potentially huge financial dividends. According to the Nikkei Asian Review, World Rugby\u2019s wish list for the 2019 legacy includes creating 40 million new rugby fans, adding 2 million new players across the region by the end of next year and seeing another Asian team qualify for the 2023 World Cup. Twenty-four hours before the opening match, supporters, organisers and, very possibly, a large number of neutrals, are clinging onto the hope that Japan will avoid becoming victims of their success in England and defy the predictions from uncooperative cephalopods. Recalling Japan\u2019s exploits against South Africa, their popular captain, Michael Leitch, neatly summed up just how precarious rugby\u2019s place in the Japanese sporting firmament has been. \u201cWhen we left for England there were roughly 25 people waving us off at the airport,\u201d Leitch said this week, according to Kyodo news agency. \u201cWhen we came back there were 6,000.\u201d There will be no need for a homecoming this time around, but a place in the quarterfinals \u2013 a feat that will require a big win over Russia and leaves little room for blunders against Ireland, Samoa or Scotland \u2013 should go some way towards realising Leitch\u2019s vision for the sport in the country he has called home since the age of 15. Reflecting on his side\u2019s 2015 post-Springboks loss to Scotland, Leitch added: \u201cAlthough we lost, we inspired Japan and this time round, at a home World Cup, we have the opportunity to inspire Japan again.\u201d We will soon know if the Brave Blossoms have it in them to seize their moment.",

Joe Kennedy is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the grand-nephew of US president John F Kennedy. </p> <p>Joe Kennedy, according to the Associated Press, is laying the ground work for a run in 2020 to challenge Democratic incumbent <strong>senator Ed Markey</strong> for the party\u2019s nomination. The Boston Globe <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/09/18/joe-kennedy-formally-announce-run-for-senate/YGYTqnr197ahCYtQupxwqM/story.html\">reported</a> that the announcement would make a formal announcement on Saturday. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think primaries are something that people should shy away from,\u201d Kennedy told reporters at the state Democratic convention last Saturday. \u201cThe idea behind it is that every seat, my own included, the one that I currently occupy as a member of the House of Representatives, it\u2019s up every two years.

While Kennedy, 38, can make the generational change argument against Markey, 73, the Massachusetts senator has worked hard to cement his progressive bona fides. He is a lead sponsor of the <strong>Green New Deal</strong> and has already earned the endorsement of young, progressive star <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </strong>He also secured the early backing of Massachusetts senator<strong> Elizabeth Warren</strong>, a presidential hopeful endorsed by both Kennedy and Markey, and is supported by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Kennedy has already racked up some endorsements, notably from <strong><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/11/joe-kennedy-ed-markey-challenge-1491098\">moderate Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema</a></strong> and, according to the Washington Post, former Massachusetts governor <strong>Bill Weld</strong>, who is challenging Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1174716365749530624\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bill Weld, visiting the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/washingtonpost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@washingtonpost</a> offices, weighs in on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MASEN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MASEN</a> primary: &quot;I&#39;m for Kennedy.

As to the argument about poor governance and past corruption scandals, she said the district performed better than many states. </p> <p><strong>Bowser</strong> also directly confronted what is often the subtext of opposition to statehood: the city\u2019s racial and political makeup. </p> <p>The 68-mile cosmopolitan block that is DC has a diverse population \u2013 nearly 50% of residents are African American, a share that has declined in recent decades as the percentage of white, Asian American and Latino residents grows. Politically, it remains one of the bluest bastion\u2019s in the US. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won DC\u2019s 3 electoral votes with more than 90% of the vote. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Yes, it is true that we are more brown and more liberal than some of you, but denying statehood would be unfair no matter who was affected</strong>\u2014it would be unfair if we were conservatives from a rural district built around agriculture or an industrial city in the heartland.

The paper citied two former officials familiar with the matter and said it was not immediately clear which foreign leader Trump had interacted with. In the weeks prior to the complaint, Trump held a call with Russian president Vladimir Putin and exchanged letters with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson </strong>is due to appear before the House intelligence committee for a closed-door briefing on the handling of the whistleblower complaint at 9am. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, <strong>Al Sharpton</strong>, former tennis player <strong>James Blake</strong> and <strong>Gwen Carr</strong>, the mother of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a police chokehold, will testify to <strong>House judiciary committee on policing practices </strong>at 10am.

(Full disclosure: yours truly is a tax-paying resident of the nation\u2019s capital.) Shortly afterward,<strong> House speaker Nancy Pelosi </strong>will hold her weekly press conference to unveil legislation to negotiate lower drug prices for Americans.

      "bodyText": "Wrapping up tonight\u2019s political coverage with an updated summary of today\u2019s political news. There\u2019s a lot going on. First, the latest on emerging details about a complaint about the president from within the intelligence community: The whistleblower complaint at the heart of a showdown between the intelligence community and Congress involved \u201cmultiple acts\u201d involving the president, including one in which Trump made a commitment during a phone call with a foreign leader, according to the New York Times. The complaint involves Ukraine, and was filed weeks after a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, both the Washington Post and the New York Times reported. The president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, faced sharp public criticism earlier this year for his public comments encouraging Ukraine\u2019s government to pursue investigations that would politically benefit Trump, including one involving the son of Vice President Joe Biden, one of the leading Democratic contenders to face off with Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The inspector general of the American intelligence community briefed Congress on Thursday but provided few details about the complaint, according to lawmakers. He is expected to appear before Congress again next week. Meanwhile: After sustained public outcry and political pressure, the Trump administration backed away from its plan to deport critically ill immigrant children, NBC News reported. Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s secretary of Housing and Urban Development, made a transphobic remark targeting trans women while meeting with federal employees in San Francisco, the Washington Post reported. Trump poured cold water on background check legislation even as Speaker Pelosi hammered Mitch McConnell on his reluctance to move ahead with legislation unless and until it has the full support of the president. Trump sued prosecutors in Manhattan to try to block the release of his tax returns after the state passed a law paving the way for their publication. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a surprise meeting with Trump in Washington on Thursday. It was \u201cnice,\u201d Trump tweeted. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, a prominent self-help writer, faced questions over what she said, and didn\u2019t say, during a 2012 interview on on a 9/11 conspiracy theorist\u2019s radio show. Also: More than 500 Americans have been diagnosed with vaping-related breathing illnesses, and at least eight have died, American health officials said. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a meeting with Trump in Washington on Thursday. The president, who has railed about his perception that social media companies are biased against conservatives, called the meeting \u201cnice.\u201d The whistleblower complaint at the heart of a showdown between the intelligence community and Congress \u201ccenters on Ukraine,\u201d the Washington Post reported, citing \u201ctwo people familiar with the matter.\u201d The New York Times also reported that \u201cAt least part of the allegation deals with Ukraine,\u201d citing two people familiar with the matter. Reports that a member of the American intelligence community has made an official complaint about Trump, which in part involves his communications with a foreign leader and a \u201cpromise,\u201d have roiled Washington in the past week. Just two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a former television star who once played the president of Ukraine in a popular television show, the Washington Post reported. In May, the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, faced sharp public criticism for his suggestion that Ukraine should pursue investigations that would politically benefit Trump, including one involving the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, one of the leading Democratic contenders for the 2020 presidential election. Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), made a transphobic comment this week during a meeting with federal employees in San Francisco, the Washington Post reported. At least one person at the meeting walked out in protest, staffers told the Washington Post. Carson said he was concerned about \u201cbig, hairy men\u201d trying to infiltrate women\u2019s homeless shelters, a remark that multiple people at the meeting interpreted as an attack on trans women, according to the Post. Fearmongering over the effects of giving trans women access to homeless shelters and domestic violence shelters is a common trope among anti-trans activists. In May, HUD proposed a new rule that would gut protections for homeless trans people at federally funded homeless shelters. \u201cRescinding this rule is a shameful decision that will result in trans shelter-seekers being forced on the streets,\u201d Julian Castro, Obama\u2019s HUD secretary, and a current Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted at the time. \u201cA lack of stable housing fuels the violence and abuse that takes the lives of many transgender people of color across the country,\u201d Mara Keisling, Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality said in a statement in May. Multiple academic studies have confirmed that trans inclusive policies do not endanger cis people. At the same time, there is substantial evidence that trans people, particularly women of color, are victimized at disproportionately high rates and face abusive treatment in public places. During his San Francisco visit, Carson also complained that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women, staffers told the Washington Post. \u201cThe Secretary does not use derogatory language to refer to transgendered individuals. Any reporting to the contrary is false,\u201d a HUD spokesperson told the Washington Post. Carson has a history of making transphobic comments in public, and has \u201crepeatedly mocked transgender people in internal meetings in Washington,\u201d the Post reported, citing a government official. After widespread pushback from Congress and the public, the Trump administration is officially backing away from its plan to deport critically ill immigrant children, NBC News reported. Last week, during a Congressional hearing, children suffering from serious illnesses testified to lawmakers that they could die if they were sent back to their home countries, NBC reported. \u201cIt is remarkable that it takes emergency hearings in Congress and a national uproar to protect seriously ill children from facing deportation,\u201d Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of Congress, said in a statement Thursday. In a 2012 radio interview with a prominent 9/11 conspiracy theorist, Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson said that having \u201cquestions\u201d about 9/11 was understandable, and that she herself had questions about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, CNN reported. Williamson\u2019s comment came during a 2012 radio interview on Truth Jihad, hosted by conspiracy theorist Kevin Barrett. The prominent self-help writer was responding to Barrett\u2019s account of being \u201cchased out of the academy\u201d for \u201cquestions surrounding what really happened on September 11, 2001.\u201d During the interview, Barrett, the conspiracy theorist, called the United States \u201cpretty fascist\u201d for its treatment of 9/11 \u201ctruthers.\u201d \u201cIf that means that you can\u2019t even come close to telling the truth about the most important event of the century and still have a job as a professor, or at least you\u2019re risking your job -- then we\u2019re pretty fascist,\u201d Barrett said during the interview. \u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t agree with you more,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd I think, listen, to have questions about 9/11, to me, is no different than having questions about the Warren Commission [which investigated Kennedy\u2019s assassination]. And I don\u2019t believe in the single bullet theory of the Kennedy assassination either.\u201d While Williamson offered \u201csome push back against Barrett\u2019s worldview,\u201d during the interview, she \u201cfailed to challenge\u201d his views about 9/11, CNN wrote. Williamson has done multiple interviews with other 9/11 conspiracy theorists, CNN reported, but did not discuss conspiracy about the 2001 terror attacks in those other interviews. Williamson\u2019s campaign manager told CNN that the appearances were \u201cnot an endorsement of the hosts philosophy or ideas,\u201d adding \u201cshe\u2019s talking about her ideas, not theirs.\u201d Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg privately told members of Congress this week that Libra, Facebook\u2019s controversial digital currency, would not launch anywhere until it receives backing from American regulators, the Washington Post reported. Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican senator from Missouri, also suggested that Facebook sell Instagram and WhatsApp to demonstrate a new commitment to user privacy. Hawley said Zuckerberg \u201cdid not think that was a great idea,\u201d the Associated Press reported. More than 500 Americans have been diagnosed with vaping-related breathing illnesses, and at least eight have died, U.S. health officials said today. The cause remains unknown, the Associated Press reported. In a single week, the number of \u201cconfirmed and probable\u201d cases of vaping-related illness grew from 380 to 530, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The eight vaping-related death was a man in his mid-40s who died this week in a St. Louis hospital, health officials said. No single vaping product or ingredient has been linked to the illnesses, though most patients reported vaping THC, the high-producing ingredient in marijuana. After weeks of being called \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d for his refusal to move forward with increased funding for election security, Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell endorsed spending $250 million to help states prevent outside meddling in the 2020 elections. \u201cThis bipartisan progress should be celebrated,\u201d McConnell wrote on Twitter. It was a relatively busy morning in Washington. Here is what has happened today. The whistleblower complaint at the heart of a showdown between the intelligence community and Congress involved \u201cmultiple acts\u201d involving the president, including one in which Trump made a commitment during a phone call with a foreign leader, according to the New York Times. The inspector general of the American intelligence community briefed Congress on Thursday but provided few details about the complaint, according to lawmakers. He is expected to appear before Congress again next week. Trump poured cold water on background check legislation even as Speaker Pelosi hammered Mitch McConnell on his reluctance to move ahead with legislation unless and until it has the full support of the president. Trump sued prosecutors in Manhattan to try to block the release of his tax returns after the state passed a law paving the way for their publication. The White House withdrew its nomination of Jeffrey Byard to lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency after concerns about a personal concerns involving an altercation were raised during the confirmation process. Before I sign off for the day, I thought we could check in on some of the Democratic presidential candidates and see what they\u2019re up to today. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, joined a picket line with United Auto Workers members who are on strike against General Motors. Check out this interview where Bernie Sanders gushes over his grandchildren. Yes, that\u2019s correct. *Gushes* Montana governor Steve Bullock is making his pitch to the leadership of the American Federation of Teachers as part of their endorsement process. The NRA has sardonically named Beto O\u2019Rourke \u201cAR-15 salesman of the year\u201d after he called for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. He pointed out a flaw in their argument \u2013 increasingly more companies are banning their sale as public opinion turns. Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, amplified the push for statehood for the District of Columbia. Former vice president Joe Biden picks up an endorsement from North Carolina congressman GK Butterfield. California senator Kamala Harris is increasingly turning her focus to Iowa. And South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg takes a swipe at Warren, calling her \u201cevasive\u201d on how she\u2019ll pay for a single-payer healthcare plan. Just in: Trump has quietly withdrawn his nomination of Jeffrey Byard to lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency after concerns about a personal concerns involving an altercation were raised during the confirmation process. Bernie Sanders presidential campaign has reached a new milestone with 1 million individual donors. The whistleblower complaint at the heart of an extraordinary standoff between Congress and the intelligence community is said to involve \u201cmultiple acts\u201d by the president, according to the New York Times. Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, revealed to lawmakers on Thursday that the complaint involved multiple acts, the Times reported, citing two officials familiar with the situation. Lawmakers said Atkinson declined to discuss specifics during a briefing with the panel and would not say if the complaint involved the president. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the complaint involves a \u201cpromise\u201d Trump made during a phone conversation with a foreign leader. Trump on Twitter scoffed at the assertion that he would make such a commitment on a telephone call that he knew might be listened to by intelligence officers from the US and other countries. Time Magazine is reporting that one of Trump\u2019s phone calls with a foreign leader involved a commitment related to US foreign policy that the whistleblower found troubling. The Washington state attorney general filed a lawsuit on Thursday to stop the Trump Administration from funneling billions of dollars approved for military construction projects to help build his long-promised wall along the US southern border with Mexico. Presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke will join climate protesters in Denver on Friday. The global climate strikes are expected to draw millions of people around the world in more than 4,000 locations to the streets as part of a weeklong movement to focus international attention on the climate emergency. It\u2019s the latest of a succession of Friday strikes led by schoolchildren such as Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The \u201cselfie lines\u201d exist everywhere. Congressman Tom Reed, a Republican from New York, is \u201cdoing well\u201d after collapsing in the Capitol rotunda earlier today, according to his office. Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders received raucous applause at the MSNBC climate forum in Washington. That could have something to do with his sweeping, $16tn climate plan he proposed earlier this year. Read more about Sanders plan to combat the climate crisis from my colleague Emily Holden and myself Amazon and the climate Online retail giant Amazon, which delivers more than 10 billion items a year on fuel-guzzling planes, vans and trucks, vowed earlier today to cut the amount of damage it does to the environment and report its greenhouse gas emissions regularly. The company has been facing pressure from its own employees to do more to combat the climate crisis and rely less on fossil fuels. Meanwhile, more than 80 advocacy, environmental, faith, student, and labor organizations published an open letter to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, slamming what it called the company\u2019s damaging effects on the climate, workers and local communities. The letter is part of coordinated actions throughout the country to support youth leading global climate strikes tomorrow. Amazon workers are expected to walk out demanding the company do more to combat the climate crisis and implement a policy for zero emissions by 2030. Earlier today, Bezos committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and 100% renewable energy by 2030. The company ordered 100,000 electric vehicles, which it asserted was the largest order ever for electric delivery vehicles. It also said it would invest $100 million in reforestation projects internationally. More than 1,500 Amazon employees have pledged to walk off their jobs tomorrow as part of the Global Climate Strike, in which millions of people around the world are expected to protest human-caused global heating and delay and intransigence from many governments. The Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, reported that: Amazon will become the first signatory of the newly formed \u201cClimate Pledge,\u201d a pact announced by company founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement 10 years early. It noted that Amazon employees are walking out tomorrow amid criticism of the company. Bezos was speaking at an event in Washington with former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. She said: \u201cWhen it comes to climate change, it is critical that national policy as well as corporate decision-making and planning is science-driven.\u201d Meanwhile, the Guardian has launched a Covering Climate Now initiative, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate emergency. United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres yesterday warned that humans were losing the race to prevent the kind of climate catastrophe by 2030 that the intergovernmental panel on climate change warned about last year and which activist Greta Thunberg has been reiterating to the US Congress all week in hearings and addresses. Congressman Adam Schiff, the California Democrat and chairman of the Intelligence Committee, spoke to reporters after meeting with the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, refused to share details of the whistleblower complaint. Congressman Joe Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is planing to run for Senate, multiple news outlets have confirmed. The news is an earthquake in Massachusetts politics, where the Kennedy name still carries significant cachet. Joe Kennedy is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the grand-nephew of US president John F Kennedy. Joe Kennedy, according to the Associated Press, is laying the ground work for a run in 2020 to challenge Democratic incumbent senator Ed Markey for the party\u2019s nomination. The Boston Globe reported that the announcement would make a formal announcement on Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t think primaries are something that people should shy away from,\u201d Kennedy told reporters at the state Democratic convention last Saturday. \u201cThe idea behind it is that every seat, my own included, the one that I currently occupy as a member of the House of Representatives, it\u2019s up every two years. It\u2019s a two-year term. You have to go out and make that case to voters every two years.\u201d But Markey will be a formidable opponent. While Kennedy, 38, can make the generational change argument against Markey, 73, the Massachusetts senator has worked hard to cement his progressive bona fides. He is a lead sponsor of the Green New Deal and has already earned the endorsement of young, progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He also secured the early backing of Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a presidential hopeful endorsed by both Kennedy and Markey, and is supported by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Meanwhile, Kennedy has already racked up some endorsements, notably from moderate Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema and, according to the Washington Post, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. We are flipping between the multiple interesting and important hearings taking place on Capitol Hill today. Let\u2019s go for a moment to the hearing on statehood for the District of Columbia, the first of its kind in a generation. Though the more than 700,000 residents of Washington DC can vote in presidential elections, they have no voting representation in Congress and only limited control over their government. Democrats and supporters of statehood say their current status equates to \u201ctaxation without representation,\u201d which was the rallying cry for American colonists who eventually revolted from Britain and founded the United States. Conservatives are largely opposed to adding a 51st star to the flag, often pointing to concerns about corruption in local DC government. In her opening testimony, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser told members: \u201cI was born in Washington, DC, and generations of my family \u2014 through no choice of our own \u2014 have been denied the fundamental right promised to all Americans: the right to full representation in the Congress guaranteed by statehood.\u201d She tackled the arguments against statehood one by one, noting that despite it\u2019s size, DC has more residents than two US states, which each have members of Congress and senators. As to the argument about poor governance and past corruption scandals, she said the district performed better than many states. Bowser also directly confronted what is often the subtext of opposition to statehood: the city\u2019s racial and political makeup. The 68-mile cosmopolitan block that is DC has a diverse population \u2013 nearly 50% of residents are African American, a share that has declined in recent decades as the percentage of white, Asian American and Latino residents grows. Politically, it remains one of the bluest bastion\u2019s in the US. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won DC\u2019s 3 electoral votes with more than 90% of the vote. Yes, it is true that we are more brown and more liberal than some of you, but denying statehood would be unfair no matter who was affected\u2014it would be unfair if we were conservatives from a rural district built around agriculture or an industrial city in the heartland. This is America, and Americans are entitled to equal protection under the law, and that\u2019s why we are demanding statehood. Making DC a state would no doubt be a tricky undertaking that would touch many aspects of everyday life for residents of the nation\u2019s capital. Here congressman Thomas Massie, a conservative from Kentucky, raises a point about parking. Could it be the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d of statehood negotiations? We\u2019re seeing some newsy bits dribble out of the Congressional briefing with Intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday unveiled the Democrats long-awaited plan to lower the cost of prescription drugs. It is a rare priority shared by the Democratic-controlled House and the White House, giving this bill greater-than-zero odds of making its way to the president\u2019s desk. At a press conference on Thursday, Pelosi called the plan \u201ctransformative\u201d. \u201cWe do hope to have White House buy-in,\u201d she added. The plan is ambitious. It would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for 250 costly drugs. Under the bill, pharmaceutical companies that refuse to negotiate with the US Health and Human Services would face stiff penalties that start at 65% of the total sales from the drug. The proposal would cap copays for seniors enrolled in Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug plan at $2,000. There is currently no limit. And the price negotiated by HHS would be available to individuals on private insurance plans. Despite Trump\u2019s interest in this, House Republicans have panned the plan as \u201ca socialist proposal to appease her most extreme members.\u201d There are so many \u201cinitial steps\u201d in House Democrats\u2019 delicate dance around impeachment. But for those keeping up with this wild two-step, CNN is reporting that the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to possibly hold Corey Lewandowski in contempt of Congress after refusing to answer questions in a theatrical performance before the panel earlier this week. Donald Trump does no want his tax returns made public. Now Trump is asking a federal judge to prevent New York prosecutors from obtaining eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. Trump\u2019s attorneys filed a lawsuit Thursday in US District Court in New York. According to the Associated Press, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow says the lawsuit is intended \u201cto address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case.\u201d Trump has sued multiple times to block the release of his tax returns. Earlier this year, the president filed a lawsuit against House Democrats and the state of New York over a new law passed that would allow tax officials to turn over the president\u2019s state tax returns. Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a chokehold by an NYPD officer, is testifying alongside civil rights leader Al Sharpton at a congressional hearing on policing. In her testimony, Carr said it was \u201cimpossible to describe the pain\u201d of losing her son. Carr lost her husband two months ago and her granddaughter, Erica Garner, daughter of Eric Garner, died in 2017. Of Erica, Carr said: \u201cI say she died of a broken heart. These are the wounds of the seen and unseen from the police brutality. The loss of loved ones and no resources, no accountability. The entire family is traumatized.\u201d The New York City police officer whose chokehold led to Eric Garner\u2019s death in 2014 was fired from the Police Department and stripped of his pension benefits on Monday, ending a bitter battle that had cast a shadow over the nation\u2019s largest police force. Daniel Pantaleo, the NYPD officer whose chokehold led to Garner\u2019s death in 2014, was fired last month from his job after the Staten Island district attorney and the Justice Department declined to charge him with a crime. He had been allowed to remain on the police force during the bitter, years-long legal battle. Garner\u2019s death and his final words \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 became a rallying cry for police reform in New York and around the country. Donald Trump has denied saying anything \u201cinappropriate\u201d to a foreign leader after a Washington Post report, confirmed by other news outlets, revealed that a whistleblower in the US intelligence community filed a formal complaint alleging that the president made a troubling \u201cpromise\u201d to that leader. In a series of tweets, Trump said he is aware that US intelligence agents and their foreign counterparts listen to these phone conversations and asked if there was \u201canybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u2019 call.\u201d In a separate tweet, Trump insinuated that the Post report was another example of \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d We\u2019re going to check in briefly on the confirmation hearing of Eugene Scalia taking place this morning before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Scalia, son of the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, is facing sharp questions from Democrats who are uneasy with his career as an attorney for corporate clients. Scalia, who was introduced to the committee by Transportation secretary, who was the former labor secretary under president George W Bush (and is the wife of the Senate majority leader) Elaine Chao, said in his opening remarks that his previous work as the department\u2019s top lawyer proved that, once there, he \u201chad new clients, new responsibilities and a public trust.\u201d The AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s largest labor federation, opposes his nomination. They have described Scalia as a \u201cunion-busting lawyer seeking new opportunities to ruthlessly advance corporate interests\u201d. Democrats have accused Republicans of rushing the confirmation hearing, giving them little time to scour his record. Senator Lamar Alexander, chair of the HELP committee, has defended the decision. Senator Patty Murray, the ranking member of the HELP committee, described Scalia as an \u201celite corporate lawyer\u201d in her opening statement. Scalia\u2019s nomination is opposed by the AFL-CIO. The labor federation has described him as a union-busting lawyer who has eroded labor rights and consumer protections. Emily England Clyburn, wife House majority whip Jim Clyburn, has died at the age of 80. They met in jail after a civil rights protest and were married for nearly 60 years. \u201cEmily Clyburn was a champion of equality and opportunity who made a difference for countless young people in her beloved South Carolina,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cAs a librarian, she intimately understood the power of learning to transform lives, and dedicated decades to ensuring that every child, servicemember, veteran and worker could access a good education that would allow him or her to climb the ladders of opportunity in America. Her extraordinary leadership, together with Jim, to increase learning opportunities at their beloved alma mater South Carolina State will stand always as an enduring tribute to her beautiful life and legacy.\u201d As expected, the Trump administration said on Thursday that it would revoke California\u2019s authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards and bar states from establishing their own regulations. The decision is likely to set off a furious legal battle. \u201cNo state has the authority to opt out of the nation\u2019s rules and no state has the right to impose its policies on everybody else in our whole country,\u201d Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said at a press conference. \u201cTo do otherwise harms consumers and damages the American economy.\u201d She argued the administration is \u201cstanding up\u201d for the American worker and the American consumer. California, no stranger to taking on the president, said it\u2019s prepared to fight the administration. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to do whatever it takes to save California\u2019s long-standing authority to set vehicle emissions standards,\u201d said Xavier Becerra, the state\u2019s attorney general. Governor Gavin Newsom invited Trump to join California in the 21st Century. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/17/trump-california-vehicle-emissions-standards-auto-industry Donald Trump said the White House is not ready to propose gun control legislation after a series of mass shootings in August that revived efforts to push for action in Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re not moving on anything,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Ed Henry in an interview at the US-Mexico border. \u201cWe\u2019re going very slowly in one way cause we want to make sure it\u2019s right. We\u2019re doing a very careful job.\u201d In the clip released this morning, Trump singled out presidential hopefulhttps://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1174665740961701892, who has unapologetically called for the mandatory buyback of assault weapons. After a mass shooting that targeted Latino immigrants in his hometown of El Paso, O\u2019Rourke has made gun violence his campaign\u2019s top priority. On Wednesday, his campaign announced that it was launching a five-state campaign to \u201cactivate the country\u2019s next wave of gun safety advocates\u201d in the lead up to the Giffords/March for Our Lives presidential forum on 2 October. \u201cIt will take each and every one of us to meet the challenge of ending gun violence in this country,\u201d said Beto for America Campaign Manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon. \u201cThat is why our campaign will not wait until the election to seek real change - to inspire, engage, and train the next wave of gun safety advocates who can join Beto in fighting for what we know is right: ambitious solutions that meet the courage of the American people and the magnitude of this crisis.\u201d But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s blunt admission that as president he would require Americans to give up their assault weapons has sparked blowback from Republicans and some Democrats. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, who is leading a long shot, bipartisan effort to pass background check legislation told reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday: \u201cI can tell you one thing: Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s not taking my guns away from me. You tell Beto that, OK?\u201d Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of politics. The temperature has finally dropped in Washington but expect a lot of heated exchanges on Capitol Hill where Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, the son of the late supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, appears today for his confirmation hearing. And that\u2019s far from the only thing we\u2019re watching today. Here\u2019s what to expect. Late last night the Washington Post reported that at the center of a showdown between members of Congress and the US intelligence community was a whistleblower complaint asserting that Trump made a \u201ctroubling\u201d promise with a foreign leader. The paper citied two former officials familiar with the matter and said it was not immediately clear which foreign leader Trump had interacted with. In the weeks prior to the complaint, Trump held a call with Russian president Vladimir Putin and exchanged letters with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson is due to appear before the House intelligence committee for a closed-door briefing on the handling of the whistleblower complaint at 9am. Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, Al Sharpton, former tennis player James Blake and Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a police chokehold, will testify to House judiciary committee on policing practices at 10am. At the same time, the House oversight committee will hold a hearing on the District of Columbia\u2019s decades-long quest for statehood to once and for all end the injustice of \u201ctaxation without representation\u201d for more than 700,000 people. (Full disclosure: yours truly is a tax-paying resident of the nation\u2019s capital.) Shortly afterward, House speaker Nancy Pelosi will hold her weekly press conference to unveil legislation to negotiate lower drug prices for Americans. She\u2019ll likely be asked about fresh reporting on tensions within leadership over the handling of the \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Transport are set to announce that they are revoking California\u2019s waiver to set stricter car mileage standards than the federal government. EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler will testify before the House committee on science and tech at the EPA at 10am. As the White House defends its widespread attack on federal efforts to combat climate change, MSNBC hosts a climate forum at Georgetown University with several candidates aspiring to replace Donald Trump. Among those who will speak on day one of the two-day forum are Democratic presidential hopefuls Michael Bennet, Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, Bernie Sanders, John Delaney, Tim Ryan and Juli\u00e1n Castro. In the afternoon, Steve Bullock will hold a town hall with the American Federation of Teachers as part of a process to be considered for the union\u2019s endorsement. To top it off, Trump has no public events on his schedule. It\u2019s a Washington clich\u00e9 as old as covfefe, but when the president fades from public view, @realDonaldTrump springs to life.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has declared his week-long visit to the US \u2013 his first as prime minister \u2013 will lay the foundations for another hundred years of mateship between Australia and America. Arriving at the Joint Base Andrews on Thursday night Washington time, the Australian prime minister said the visit would improve the defence, security and economic partnership between the two countries, and joint activities in the Indo-Pacific region and the Middle East. The damaging trade dispute between the US and China and Australia\u2019s decision to contribute to a US-led mission in the Strait of Hormuz hang over Morrison\u2019s visit. Regional tensions have escalated since drone strikes were launched against Saudi oil facilities last Saturday, with the US insisting Iran is responsible. Morrison said it was a \u201cgreat honour and privilege\u201d to be welcomed to the US capital by the Trump administration to celebrate a century of close diplomatic ties, and the trip, which includes a program in Chicago and New York, would lay the foundation \u201cfor another 100 years\u201d. \u201cThere are many larger, I suppose, more powerful friends that America has, but they know they do not have a more sure and steadfast friend than Australia,\u201d Morrison said. The prime minister was welcomed on arrival at Andrews by the US ambassador to Australia, Arthur Culvahouse, and his wife, Melanie Lyell-Aiken, as well as the assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, David Stilwell. The official program will begin on Friday Washington time, with a meeting with the US president, Donald Trump, and members of the cabinet. A senior Trump administration official has told reporters the two countries would also explore collaboration on space exploration and rare earths, Reuters reported. \u201cWe are going to have some announcements on a MOU between Nasa and the Australian Space Agency on returning to the moon by 2024 and to explore new areas of mutual interest in things like automation and robotics,\u201d the official said. A plan would also be announced on improving the \u201csecurity and supply of rare earths in a way that is mutually beneficial to both countries\u201d. The official described Australia as \u201can absolutely essential partner\u201d in Trump\u2019s \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific vision\u201d. In a sign that the Americans are rolling out the diplomatic red carpet since Australian voters re-elected the Coalition in May, the Trump administration has also offered Morrison a state dinner \u2013 the first for an Australian prime minister since the Howard era. With Australia keen to encourage US involvement in the Indo-Pacific to balance China\u2019s presence, Morrison has been at pains to say Australia is an ally that is steadfast, and pulls its weight. Before leaving Australia, he declared Australia was a partner the US could rely on \u2013 \u201ca partner that pulls their weight in the alliance\u201d. Morrison said he had a good personal relationship with Trump but the alliance was \u201cfar more than that\u201d. Australia\u2019s decision to contribute to the mission in the Strait of Hormuz aimed at protecting freedom of navigation in the Gulf region demonstrated that it was \u201calways prepared to do the heavy lifting when it comes to our alliance partnerships\u201d, he said.",
