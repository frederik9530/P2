Then, she said, a political \u201csmear\u201d campaign began to paint her as \u201ccrazy and dangerous\u201d. At the event on Thursday, Williamson laid out her case for the nomination while touting her plan to establish a \u201cDepartment of Peace,\u201d the centerpiece of her campaign platform. </p> <p>She talked about the layers of trauma average Americans face \u2013 food scarcity, homelessness, drug abuse, violence, among other issues. \u201cLarge groups of desperate people are a national security risk,\u201d she said. <br>Williamson also expanded on her criticism of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which sets the rules for participation in the party\u2019s presidential primary debates. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt should be the purpose of the DNC to facilitate American democracy not dictate American democracy,\u201d she said, decrying her exclusion from the debate stage. </p> <p>In response to a question about whether she supported any military interventions in recent US history, Williamson said she is \u201cnot a pacifist\u201d. She said she would have gone to war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and added that, had she been president, she would have intervened in Rwanda. <br></p> <p>Williamson fielded other questions that seemed tailored to her unique appeal: What did she make of Trump assertion that he deserves a Nobel Peace prize? She laughed, \u201cPoor darlin\u2019. I don\u2019t think he could help himself.\u201d <br></p> <p>She has as much political experience as Trump when he ran for president \u2013 which is to say none \u2013 so why does she think she can do the job better? <br></p> <p>She said Trump\u2019s problem wasn\u2019t a lack of experience, it was a \u201clack of ethics\u201d.<br></p> <p>And finally, would she consider <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> for a position in her Department of Peace? <br></p> <p>Williamson paused before concluding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be drawn into this pile on of Hillary Clinton that should offend every American woman.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db20ac08f08993584c8b134\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-24T20:39:22.429Z\">9.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">White House reportedly delayed Ukraine trade decision in August</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Trump administration </strong>reportedly delayed a decision on Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges in August, possibly indicating that the White House tried to exert pressure on Ukrainian officials beyond the delaying of the country\u2019s military aid.</p> <p>The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-delayed-ukraine-trade-decision-in-august-a-signal-that-us-suspension-of-cooperation-extended-beyond-security-funds/2019/10/24/a42b8992-f67d-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html\">reports</a>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The White House\u2019s trade representative in late August withdrew a recommendation to restore some of Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges after <strong>John Bolton</strong>, then-national security adviser, warned him that President <strong>Trump</strong> probably would oppose any action that benefited the government in Kyiv, according to people briefed on the matter. ...</p> <p>The August exchange between Bolton and Lighthizer over the trade matter represents the first indication that the administration\u2019s suspension of assistance to Ukraine extended beyond the congressionally authorized military aid and security assistance to other government programs.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a recap of today: The White House reportedly delayed a decision on Ukraine trade in August, suggesting that the administration was using more than military aid to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden. Senator Lindsey Graham released his resolution criticizing the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, calling on them to \u201cvote to open a formal impeachment inquiry and provide President Trump with fundamental constitutional protections\u201d. Summer Zervos, a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who is suing Trump for defamation after he denied her allegation of sexual assault, said she has corroborating evidence to support her story. Colleagues paid their respects to the late congressman Elijah Cummings. Tim Ryan dropped out 2020 presidential race. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign indicated that it is no longer opposed to the involvement of super Pacs. Bernie Sanders revealed a plan to legalize marijuana... at 4:20 PM. Bernie Sanders confesses: \u201cI am old\u201d He made the admission at a campaign event in Iowa. Here\u2019s a schedule of upcoming hearings in the impeachment inquiry: Courtesy of Axios reporter Alayna Treene. Bernie Sanders released a plan to legalize marijuana ... at 4:20 PM Eastern Time His plan would expunge all marijuana-related convictions, ban tobacco companies from entering the business and create a $20bn program support minority entrepreneurs. Eleven states and Washington, DC have already legalized marijuana, but it remains illegal at the federal level. 2020 Democratic candidates all broadly agree on legalization. Using taxes levied on marijuana sales, Sanders\u2019 plan would fund a $20bn program for entrepreneurs of color, and $10bn grant to promote business in areas disproportionately affected by marijuana criminalization. New Jersey is seeking to revoke a liquor license for one of Donald Trump\u2019s gold clubs, due to a 2015 incident when the club allegedly overserved alcohol to a man who caused a fatal wreck. The Washington Post reports: That proposed punishment was laid out in an Oct. 21 letter to the Trump golf course in Colts Neck, N.J. The Washington Post obtained the letter through a public records request. The office of New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, which sent the letter, declined to comment about the letter. Grewal was appointed in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy (D). The letter gives few details about the alleged misconduct by Trump\u2019s course. The man that the club is accused of over-serving \u2014 Andrew G. Halder \u2014 caused a wreck that killed his own father and last year pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is waking back opposition to independent political action committees. In a statement, his campaign manager Kate Bedingfield signaled that the former vice president will no longer discourage super Pac organizers who want to boost his 2020 primary bid. Political action committees allow wealthy individuals and corporations to contribute to campaigns. \u201cAs president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections,\u201d Bedingfield said, signaling that until then, it\u2019s \u201cnot surprising\u201d some Biden supporters are considering financing a Pac on his behalf. She noted that Donald Trump has his supporters are already spending large sums of money \u201cto intervene directly in Democratic primaries\u201d. Biden has been trailing Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in fundraising. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is mulling his outfit choices this weekend. Asked if he\u2019d throw the first pitch at the baseball World Series on Sunday, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, they got to dress me up in a lot of heavy armor.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll look too heavy\u201d Trump said, according to White House press pool reports. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The White House reportedly delayed a decision on Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges in August, indicating that the campaign to pressure Ukrainian officials to launch investigations of the Democrats may have extended beyond the delaying of military assistance. Senator Lindsey Graham released his resolution criticizing House Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry, noting that it already has dozens of Republican co-sponsors. Summer Zervos, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who is suing Trump for defamation after he denied her allegation of sexual assault, reportedly has corroborating evidence to support her story. Elijah Cummings\u2019 congressional colleagues paid their respects to the late lawmaker, who is lying in state at the Capitol today. Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan dropped out of the race, leaving 18 contenders still seeking the party\u2019s nomination. Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Democratic 2020 hopeful Marianne Williamson is a best-selling new age author and a guru to the celebs. But her campaign hasn\u2019t taken off. She\u2019s languishing at less than 1% in national polls and did not qualify for the last pair of presidential debates. The disconnect between her professional success and her political failure to launch is, she said, \u201can illusion\u201d. During a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club in Washington, Williamson took umbrage at the insinuation her campaign was not gaining traction. \u201cI sure as heck did break through,\u201d she told the moderator. \u201cIt\u2019s called the second debate.\u201d Following a zany first debate appearance in which she challenged the prime minister of New Zealand and said she would \u201charness love\u201d to beat Donald Trump, Williamson delivered a steadier performance in round two, receiving praise \u2013 and lots of Google searches \u2013 for her answers on race, reparations and the environment. After her rise in polls, Williamson said the other candidates and the Washington elite increasingly saw her as a threat. Then, she said, a political \u201csmear\u201d campaign began to paint her as \u201ccrazy and dangerous\u201d. At the event on Thursday, Williamson laid out her case for the nomination while touting her plan to establish a \u201cDepartment of Peace,\u201d the centerpiece of her campaign platform. She talked about the layers of trauma average Americans face \u2013 food scarcity, homelessness, drug abuse, violence, among other issues. \u201cLarge groups of desperate people are a national security risk,\u201d she said. Williamson also expanded on her criticism of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which sets the rules for participation in the party\u2019s presidential primary debates. \u201cIt should be the purpose of the DNC to facilitate American democracy not dictate American democracy,\u201d she said, decrying her exclusion from the debate stage. In response to a question about whether she supported any military interventions in recent US history, Williamson said she is \u201cnot a pacifist\u201d. She said she would have gone to war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and added that, had she been president, she would have intervened in Rwanda. Williamson fielded other questions that seemed tailored to her unique appeal: What did she make of Trump assertion that he deserves a Nobel Peace prize? She laughed, \u201cPoor darlin\u2019. I don\u2019t think he could help himself.\u201d She has as much political experience as Trump when he ran for president \u2013 which is to say none \u2013 so why does she think she can do the job better? She said Trump\u2019s problem wasn\u2019t a lack of experience, it was a \u201clack of ethics\u201d. And finally, would she consider Hillary Clinton for a position in her Department of Peace? Williamson paused before concluding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be drawn into this pile on of Hillary Clinton that should offend every American woman.\u201d The Trump administration reportedly delayed a decision on Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges in August, possibly indicating that the White House tried to exert pressure on Ukrainian officials beyond the delaying of the country\u2019s military aid. The Washington Post reports: The White House\u2019s trade representative in late August withdrew a recommendation to restore some of Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges after John Bolton, then-national security adviser, warned him that President Trump probably would oppose any action that benefited the government in Kyiv, according to people briefed on the matter. ... The August exchange between Bolton and Lighthizer over the trade matter represents the first indication that the administration\u2019s suspension of assistance to Ukraine extended beyond the congressionally authorized military aid and security assistance to other government programs. It is not clear whether Trump directed Bolton to intervene over Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges or was even aware of the discussion. The White House reportedly sent a letter to the lawyer of Laura Cooper a day before the Pentagon official testified in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. According to the letter obtained by the New York Times, the deputy secretary of defense, David L. Norquist, informed Cooper\u2019s lawyer she was not obligated to comply with a congressional subpoena because of the Trump administration\u2019s view that the inquiry has not been officially authorized. Norquist wrote: \u201cThis letter informs you and Ms. Cooper of the Administration-wide direction that Executive Branch personnel \u2018cannot participate in [the impeachment] inquiry under these circumstances\u2019 [Tab C]. \u201cIn the event that the Committees issue a subpoena to compel Ms. Cooper\u2019s appearance, you should be aware that the Supreme Court has held, in United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41 (1953), that a person cannot be sanctioned for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena unauthorized by House Rule or Resolution.\u201d Cooper obviously decided to go ahead with her testimony anyway, following in the footsteps of several state department officials who have similarly chosen to comply with their congressional subpoenas. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said that Trump would be arrested if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, contradicting a controversial claim made by one of the president\u2019s lawyers. The president\u2019s attorney, William Consovoy, was asked in federal court yesterday about Trump\u2019s famous claim during the 2016 campaign that he could get away with shooting someone on Fifth Avenue in New York. Consovoy argued that Trump could not be investigated for the hypothetical shooting while he was serving as president. The New York mayor is now taking issue with that. De Blasio told reporters today: \u201cIf anybody shoots someone, they get arrested. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re the president of the United States or anybody else. If you shoot someone, you should get arrested, and we would arrest him.\u201d Summer Zervos, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who is suing Trump for defamation after he denied her sexual assault allegation, reportedly has corroborating evidence supporting her story. The Hollywood Reporter explains: According to court papers filed on Thursday, the Trump Organization is attempting to designate certain documents as \u2018confidential\u2019 because they contain Trump\u2019s former cell phone number. Zervos\u2019 lawyers respond that such information is already public. But the bigger bombshells from today\u2019s filing has to do with the evidence that Zervos says she has collected to corroborate her account. Those include emails to Trump\u2019s secretary Rhona Graff to set up a meeting with him and responses from her. There are also calendar entries for Trump and his bodyguard showing how they flew from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in Dec. 2007 and stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Many of these documents are from Trump Organization files. Zervos\u2019 attorney writes calendar entries and itineraries \u2018line up with Ms. Zervos\u2019s detailed public account with striking accuracy.\u2019 ... Some of these documents, Zervos contends, are ones that the Trump Organization is now attempting to keep secret by misusing confidentiality designations. Her motion is in support of de-designation of these documents. If she succeeds, she\u2019ll be able to make them public in time for summary judgment briefing now scheduled for March. A Bloomberg News reporter noted that senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s resolution criticizing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry did not actually condemn the investigation, as the South Carolina senator had originally advertised. Senator Lindsey Graham closed the press conference on his resolution criticizing the impeachment inquiry by emphasizing that he was targeting the process of the investigation but was not necessarily defending Trump\u2019s actions. This is a strategy that a number of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies have pursued in recent weeks: slamming the inquiry as too secretive while generally avoiding comment on the president\u2019s alleged conduct toward Ukraine. Senator Lindsey Graham said his resolution condemning House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry already had 41 Republican co-sponsors. The South Carolina Republican said he believed that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was \u201cworking on getting a messaging team together\u201d to confront the inquiry. When a reporter said that the White House has already repeatedly changed its messaging strategy on impeachment, Graham quipped: \u201cHave you noticed?\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham has released the resolution criticizing House Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry against Trump. The resolution calls on House Democratic leaders to \u201cvote to open a formal impeachment inquiry and provide President Trump with fundamental constitutional protections.\u201d The resolution is supported by dozens of Republican senators, including majority leader Mitch McConnell, and comes as some Trump allies have called on Graham to use his position as chairman of the Senate judiciary committee to push back against the impeachment inquiry. As Lindsey Graham prepared to introduce a resolution criticizing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, Trump reportedly hosted the South Carolina senator and several of his Republican colleagues for lunch at the White House. The gathering comes as Trump has called on congressional Republicans to \u201cget tougher\u201d against the impeachment investigation, which appeared to spark conservative House members\u2019 protest yesterday that delayed the testimony of Pentagon official Laura Cooper. The flag at the Capitol has been lowered to half-staff in honor of the late congressman Elijah Cummings, who is lying in state there today. A number of Cummings\u2019 congressional colleagues, including the civil rights icon John Lewis, have stopped by his casket at the Capitol to pay their respects. As congressional Republicans complain about House Democrats holding closed-door interviews for the impeachment inquiry, this video from last year is recirculating on Twitter. In the video, then-congressman Trey Gowdy, who nearly joined Trump\u2019s team to combat the impeachment investigation, argued that a private hearing was \u201cmuch more constructive\u201d than the \u201ccircus\u201d of public hearings. A Daily Beast reporter also pointed out that the Republicans who are condemning the alleged secrecy of the inquiry are the same lawmakers who are defending the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the investigation. Earlier today, Amy Klobuchar became the ninth Democratic presidential candidate to qualify for the November debate in Georgia. The Minnesota senator attracted the support of 3 percent of Democratic voters in a new Quinnipiac survey, marking her fourth qualifying poll for the debate. The Quinnipiac results emphasized how varied recent polls have been, particularly when it comes to the frontrunners in the Democratic primary. According to the Quinnipiac poll, Elizabeth Warren leads Joe Biden by 7 points. However, a CNN poll released yesterday showed Biden leading all of his opponents by double digits. The editor-in-chief of the polling and analysis website FiveThirtyEight argued that, overall, the numbers have changed little since the debate in Ohio last week. For a bit of good news today, former president Jimmy Carter has been released from the hospital after suffering a fall earlier this week. The 95-year-old Carter was similarly hospitalized for a separate fall earlier this month but appears to be recovering well. Just days after Trump mused about the White House canceling its subscriptions to the Washington Post and the New York Times, his administration is now reportedly advising federal agencies to do the same. The Wall Street Journal reports: \u2018Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving\u2014hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved,\u2019 White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an email Thursday. Ms. Grisham declined to provide further details, and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the White House intended to compel agencies to cancel the subscriptions or how soon the order would take effect. The White House was still working on implementing the directive as of Thursday morning, an administration official said. Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity in an interview that aired Monday: \u201cWe don\u2019t even want [the New York Times] in the White House anymore. We\u2019re going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They\u2019re fake.\u201d This appears to be yet another instance of White House staffers scrambling to enact something that Trump had publicly floated with seemingly no warning. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo appeared to grow frustrated with a reporter in his home state of Kansas who questioned him about the impeachment inquiry and his rumored Senate ambitions. Pressed on why he has made four trips back to Kansas this year, Pompeo told the Wichita Eagle: \u201cLots of cabinet secretaries go home an awful lot more than that. We just haven\u2019t managed to do it. I frankly wish we\u2019d get back here a whole lot more.\u201d The interviewer replied: \u201cSo given everything that is going on in the world right now, you feel that this is the best use of your time as chief diplomat to be here?\u201d Pompeo replied: \u201cAbsolutely. 100 percent.\u201d For some context, the former congressman\u2019s repeated trips back to Kansas have fueled speculation that he will enter the race to replace retiring senator Pat Roberts. The interview did not improve from there. Pompeo claimed that the media was \u201cfixated\u201d on the impeachment inquiry, while the state department was not (despite many news reports to the contrary). And when asked whether Trump\u2019s treatment of America\u2019s Kurdish allies had harmed the US\u2019 international credibility, Pompeo replied: \u201cThe whole predicate of your question is insane.\u201d Needless to say, Pompeo could face some difficult questions about his tenure in the Trump administration if he does decide to launch a Senate bid. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan dropped out of the race after struggling to attract voters and failing to qualify for recent debates. Colleagues of Elijah Cummings honored the late congressman at the Capitol, where the longtime Baltimore representative will lie in state today. House Democrats are planning to advance to public hearings in their impeachment inquiry against Trump as soon as next month. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Tim Ryan failed to gain much traction since entering the presidential race in April, but during his campaign, he helped to cast a spotlight on gun violence. Ryan represents Youngstown and suburbs of Akron in the House. When a gunman opened fire on the nearby Ohio city of Dayton, Ryan lambasted Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for inaction on gun legislation. The Ohio congressman told CNN shortly after the shooting in August: \u201cMitch McConnell needs to get off his ass and do something. People are getting killed in the streets in America and nobody is acting. Nobody.\u201d Tim Ryan\u2019s exit from the presidential race means that there are now 18 contenders seeking the Democratic nomination. Of those remaining eighteen candidates, only nine have qualified for the November debate so far. Ryan\u2019s departure could put more pressure on the candidates who have not yet qualified to similarly throw in the towel. Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan just announced he would end his White House bid and instead seek reelection for his congressional seat. The Ohio congressman built his campaign around trying to appeal to Midwestern voters who swung to Trump in 2016, but Ryan has struggled to attract voters or donors and failed to qualify for the past two debates. Despite Mike Pence professing openness to establishing a better economic relationship between the US and China, the president has voiced a much more severe tone in recent months. Trump celebrated reaching a partial trade deal with China earlier this month, but the details of that agreement remain vague, and China reportedly wants to hold more talks before signing it. Mike Pence repeatedly criticized China\u2019s handling of the pro-government protests in Hong Kong, but the vice president said that the United States wanted to maintain an economic connection with Beijing. Pence said that the Trump administration was seeking a \u201cconstructive relationship\u201d with China\u2019s leaders and called on them to end the trade practices that have \u201ctaken advantage of the American people for far too long.\u201d The vice president said the US was not looking for a \u201cdecoupling from China\u201d and instead \u201cseeks engagement with China and China\u2019s engagement with the wider world.\u201d Mike Pence also used his speech on the US-Chinese relationship to criticize Nike for allegedly ignoring human rights abuses. The vice president said: \u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called \u2018social-justice champion,\u2019 but when it comes to Hong Kong it prefers checking its social conscience at the door.\u201d Trump criticized the brand last year after it launched a new ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback who was the first player to protest police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem at games. In his speech on the US-Chinese relationship, Mike Pence touched on the controversy about the NBA trying to tamp down support within the league for the protests in Hong Kong. The vice president said that by siding with China, the NBA was behaving like a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\u201d Mike Pence is delivering a speech at the Wilson Center on the future of the relationship between the United States and China. The vice president began his speech by offering greetings from Trump and celebrating the administration\u2019s \u201cmomentous week.\u201d Echoing the president, Pence claimed US victory in Syria and touted the \u201cpermanent ceasefire\u201d in the region, even though criticism continues to rage about Trump\u2019s recent decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. A number of senior lawmakers offered their memories of the late congressman Elijah Cummings at the Capitol, where the longtime Baltimore representative will lie in state today. House speaker Nancy Pelosi noted that Cummings\u2019 ceremony had a connection to Abraham Lincoln. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said that Cummings, who had severe health problems for years, had \u201cgone home.\u201d Republican representative Mark Meadows became emotional reflecting on his \u201cunexpected\u201d friendship with Cummings. The ceremony for the late congressman Elijah Cummings has begun on Capitol Hill, and House speaker Nancy Pelosi is now delivering remarks about her longtime colleague. Elijah Cummings, the late Democratic congressman from Baltimore who died last week, has arrived at the Capitol to lie in state. Many lawmakers were present to welcome Cummings\u2019 casket, and even some of the late congressman\u2019s former colleagues were there to honor him. Some House Democrats are voicing concerns that certain witnesses in the impeachment inquiry are coordinating their testimony with each other. The Daily Beast reports: Two Democratic lawmakers told The Daily Beast that, over the course of the nine witness depositions they have conducted over the last several weeks, there have been suggestions that certain witnesses spoke to each other about what they would say to impeachment investigators. If any of the witnesses lied under oath for the sake of protecting themselves or the president, they could face criminal charges. Some Democrats have voiced suspicion of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, doing just that. A lawyer for Sondland has said that his client \u201cdoes not recall\u201d a conversation with Bill Taylor about holding up Ukraine\u2019s military aid to demand public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election, contradicting the US ambassador to Ukraine\u2019s tesimony in the impeachment inquiry. Representative Eric Swalwell, who sits on the House intelligence committee, echoed these concerns on CNN this morning. Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s resolution condemning House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry comes as some of Trump\u2019s closest allies have criticized the Senate judiciary committee chairman for not doing more to defend the president against the investigation. However, it seems like that Trump\u2019s allies are not going to go easy on Graham now that he is introducing the resolution, according to an Axios reporter. As senator Lindsey Graham announced his plans to introduce a resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry, Trump sent this tweet specifically thanking House Republicans for \u201cbeing tough\u201d against the investigation. A group of conservative lawmakers successfully delayed the testimony of Laura Cooper for five hours yesterday after they stormed the secure area where the Pentagon official was set to be interviewed for the inquiry. If Trump is hoping that Senate Republicans will start deploying similar antics to distract from the incriminating new details coming to light from the investigation, Graham clearly got the message. Senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee and a close ally of Trump\u2019s, will introduce a resolution condemning House Democrats\u2019 \u201cclosed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.\u201d The South Carolina Republican intends to hold a press conference today at 3 p.m. E.T. announcing the resolution, which is co-sponsored by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. A number of congressional Republicans have criticized House Democratic leadership for conducting interviews in the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors, but this argument could soon become moot if the inquiry advances to public hearings. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, is reportedly looking for his own defense attorney now that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry has cast a spotlight on his dealings in Ukraine. CNN reports: The move by Giuliani, who is President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, is notable because last week he said he would not be seeking a new lawyer unless he felt one was needed. ... Earlier on Wednesday, Giuliani said he had not heard from the FBI, US attorneys for the Southern District of New York or any other lawyer pertaining to the Ukraine matter. ... Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Giuliani\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine in addition to a counterintelligence probe, CNN has previously reported. Two associates of the former New York mayor, Lev Parnas and Igor Furman, were charged with campaign finance-related offenses and pleaded not guilty in a court appearance Wednesday. Giuliani defended his dealings with Ukraine in a tweet last night, claiming that he was just doing everything he could to defend the president: Trump provided some clarity in a midnight tweet about why he seemed to indicate yesterday that his administration was building a border wall in ... Colorado? The president said during his speech at a shale gas conference in Pittsburgh: \u201cYou know why we\u2019re going to win New Mexico? Because they want safety on their border. And they didn\u2019t have it. And we\u2019re building a wall on the border of New Mexico, and we\u2019re building a wall in Colorado. We\u2019re building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works, that you can\u2019t get over, that you can\u2019t get under.\u201d Colorado\u2019s Democratic governor mocked Trump\u2019s comment over Twitter, citing it as evidence for the need to teach geography in school. However, Trump then tweeted late last night that he referred to Colorado because there were people from the state in the Pittsburgh audience. Given that Trump directly said that his administration was \u201cbuilding a wall in Colorado,\u201d this explanation still seems ... questionable. Good morning, live blog readers! The impeachment inquiry has escalated rapidly in recent weeks, and House Democrats are reportedly already looking to advance the investigation into its next stage \u2014 public hearings \u2014 by mid-November. The Washington Post reports: [O]n Wednesday, after conservative lawmakers stormed the hearing room and delayed the proceedings for five hours, some Democrats were feeling pressure to advance public hearings in hopes of avoiding further disruptions. ... House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her leadership team still hope to hold an impeachment vote before the holidays, though increasingly Democrats are privately acknowledging the inquiry could easily drag into December. Multiple Democratic officials said they hope to finish private depositions in early November so they can use the two-week work period just before Thanksgiving to have public hearings. Donald Trump\u2019s allies have complained about the impeachment inquiry based on its process, claiming that the reliance so far on closed-door interviews has been too secretive. However, once the probe moves to the hearings stage and officials start publicly repeating the details that have been reported in recent weeks about Trump participating in a quid pro quo, the president could be facing a career-ending situation. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: The late Democratic congressman Elijah Cummings will lie in state at the Capitol. Trump will participate in the Diwali ceremonial lighting of the Diya and present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Roger Penske. Biden will attend the funeral of Democratic activist Sonny Sloan in Wilmington, Delaware. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

This was a confused, deeply uninspired performance that will largely be forgotten because Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, the club\u2019s \u00a372m record signing who had been under mounting pressure to deliver, came off the bench to score two marvellous free-kicks in the last 10 minutes and create a silver lining where the clouds had been jet black.</p> <p>P\u00e9p\u00e9 had been criticised for missing a clear chance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/21/sheffield-united-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Monday\u2019s defeat at Sheffield United</a> and Unai Emery had made little secret of the fact his adaptation since arriving from Lille has been faltering. But his reputation for set-piece prowess precedes him and when he lined up his first, 25 yards out and at an angle to the right, there was cause to think he was Arsenal\u2019s best bet of a bailout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/24/partizan-belgrade-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\">Anthony Martial on the spot to give Manchester United win in Belgrade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was duly curled past a questionably positioned Miguel Silva, the Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es goalkeeper, and into the far corner. His second, whipped venomously from a more central position in the game\u2019s last action, was unstoppable and put Arsenal a win away from qualifying for the knockout stage. The turnaround was unexpected for the sloppy fare that had gone before but predictable for Arsenal\u2019s proven expertise in papering over the most alarming of cracks.</p> <p>\u201cThe two goals from P\u00e9p\u00e9 were perfect and I think we deserved to win,\u201d Emery said. He was half-right. What most people saw was a match in which a modest Vit\u00f3ria, expected to offer the standard level of supine opposition for a spot of escapism from Arsenal\u2019s considerable league concerns, played smartly and were the better side for long periods. They led twice, through Marcus Edwards and Bruno Duarte, and it was never out of the question that extra ignominy might be inflicted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a693e57a5cd5b7dbe3126b7b6ea8175919bc73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a693e57a5cd5b7dbe3126b7b6ea8175919bc73/0_0_4417_2650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gabriel Martinelli heads home for Arsenal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gabriel Martinelli heads home for Arsenal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fosker/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edwards piled on a sizeable enough portion of it in the eighth minute when, after shifting V\u00edctor Garc\u00eda\u2019s cutback on to his right foot, he beat Emiliano Mart\u00ednez confidently. Two months ago the 20-year-old was still a Tottenham player, reconciling himself to the fact the \u201cMini Messi\u201d epithet Mauricio Pochettino once fondly gave him would have to be lived up to elsewhere. This was only his third appearance since joining Vit\u00f3ria permanently and a knee-sliding celebration underlined the significance of his feat.</p> <p>Arsenal responded when Gabriel Martinelli, meeting Kieran Tierney\u2019s cross to take advantage of indecision from Silva and nod into a vacant goal, scored an equaliser they had hardly threatened. It should have awoken them after such a shoddy first half-hour but they are a team of recidivists and, sure enough, Ainsley Maitland-Niles promptly ceded possession to the impressive left-winger Davidson, whose daisycutter struck the post but fell perfectly for Duarte.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/24/celtic-lazio-europa-league-match-report\">Celtic edge Lazio thanks to Christopher Jullien\u2019s late header</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe lost a lot of balls in midfield and gave them chances in the transition to score and start winning,\u201d Emery said of that opening period. Matteo Guendouzi and Dani Ceballos were enlisted at the break for Maitland-Niles and the unfortunate Joe Willock, who suffered a similar fate at Bramall Lane. It says so much for Guendouzi, and perhaps for Arsenal too, that he is considered among the cavalry these days but his presence sharpened up a previously torpid midfield.</p> <p>His first major contribution was to dash 40 yards and needlessly involve himself in a spat in which Alexandre Lacazette, who was eventually replaced by P\u00e9p\u00e9 with 15 minutes left, tried to get Garc\u00eda sent off; his final one was a slaloming run that won the free-kick P\u00e9p\u00e9 converted in stoppage time.</p> <p>Guendouzi remains a flawed performer but, as he also showed in an eerily similar league comeback against Aston Villa, has a gladiatorial appetite for salvage operations like this.</p> <p>\u201cOur attack played with more emotion and heart than organisation but I think that\u2019s also important,\u201d Emery said. That is especially so when hardly anything is functioning as it should be. Perhaps Mesut \u00d6zil would have made Arsenal more fluent but he was left out of the match squad for the fifth successive game and Emery would not offer any comment on his situation afterwards. P\u00e9p\u00e9 may have come up with some timely answers but far bigger questions continue to linger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "For a long time it seemed Thursday nights, which have become Arsenal\u2019s haven from the tide of neurosis that engulfs their domestic affairs, would be struck off the list of safe spaces. This was a confused, deeply uninspired performance that will largely be forgotten because Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, the club\u2019s \u00a372m record signing who had been under mounting pressure to deliver, came off the bench to score two marvellous free-kicks in the last 10 minutes and create a silver lining where the clouds had been jet black. P\u00e9p\u00e9 had been criticised for missing a clear chance in Monday\u2019s defeat at Sheffield United and Unai Emery had made little secret of the fact his adaptation since arriving from Lille has been faltering. But his reputation for set-piece prowess precedes him and when he lined up his first, 25 yards out and at an angle to the right, there was cause to think he was Arsenal\u2019s best bet of a bailout. It was duly curled past a questionably positioned Miguel Silva, the Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es goalkeeper, and into the far corner. His second, whipped venomously from a more central position in the game\u2019s last action, was unstoppable and put Arsenal a win away from qualifying for the knockout stage. The turnaround was unexpected for the sloppy fare that had gone before but predictable for Arsenal\u2019s proven expertise in papering over the most alarming of cracks. \u201cThe two goals from P\u00e9p\u00e9 were perfect and I think we deserved to win,\u201d Emery said. He was half-right. What most people saw was a match in which a modest Vit\u00f3ria, expected to offer the standard level of supine opposition for a spot of escapism from Arsenal\u2019s considerable league concerns, played smartly and were the better side for long periods. They led twice, through Marcus Edwards and Bruno Duarte, and it was never out of the question that extra ignominy might be inflicted. Edwards piled on a sizeable enough portion of it in the eighth minute when, after shifting V\u00edctor Garc\u00eda\u2019s cutback on to his right foot, he beat Emiliano Mart\u00ednez confidently. Two months ago the 20-year-old was still a Tottenham player, reconciling himself to the fact the \u201cMini Messi\u201d epithet Mauricio Pochettino once fondly gave him would have to be lived up to elsewhere. This was only his third appearance since joining Vit\u00f3ria permanently and a knee-sliding celebration underlined the significance of his feat. Arsenal responded when Gabriel Martinelli, meeting Kieran Tierney\u2019s cross to take advantage of indecision from Silva and nod into a vacant goal, scored an equaliser they had hardly threatened. It should have awoken them after such a shoddy first half-hour but they are a team of recidivists and, sure enough, Ainsley Maitland-Niles promptly ceded possession to the impressive left-winger Davidson, whose daisycutter struck the post but fell perfectly for Duarte. \u201cWe lost a lot of balls in midfield and gave them chances in the transition to score and start winning,\u201d Emery said of that opening period. Matteo Guendouzi and Dani Ceballos were enlisted at the break for Maitland-Niles and the unfortunate Joe Willock, who suffered a similar fate at Bramall Lane. It says so much for Guendouzi, and perhaps for Arsenal too, that he is considered among the cavalry these days but his presence sharpened up a previously torpid midfield. His first major contribution was to dash 40 yards and needlessly involve himself in a spat in which Alexandre Lacazette, who was eventually replaced by P\u00e9p\u00e9 with 15 minutes left, tried to get Garc\u00eda sent off; his final one was a slaloming run that won the free-kick P\u00e9p\u00e9 converted in stoppage time. Guendouzi remains a flawed performer but, as he also showed in an eerily similar league comeback against Aston Villa, has a gladiatorial appetite for salvage operations like this. \u201cOur attack played with more emotion and heart than organisation but I think that\u2019s also important,\u201d Emery said. That is especially so when hardly anything is functioning as it should be. Perhaps Mesut \u00d6zil would have made Arsenal more fluent but he was left out of the match squad for the fifth successive game and Emery would not offer any comment on his situation afterwards. P\u00e9p\u00e9 may have come up with some timely answers but far bigger questions continue to linger.",

      "body": "<h2>1) Palace to push Emery to the brink?</h2> <p>Did Arsenal fans really humiliate the great Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \u2026 for <em>this</em>? At no point in Unai Emery\u2019s tenure has it been possible to fathom a plan, and the longer things go, the worse they look. There are just so many questions: why is he so reticent to play Lucas Torreira in his position? How can he leave Mesut \u00d6zil out of his matchday squads when his team struggle to create chances? Watching Arsenal\u2019s youngsters play in the cups, you can\u2019t help but wonder if their abandon and cohesion will last only as long as it takes for him to impose himself upon them. Realistically, to make the club competitive again will require someone brilliant, and none of the key markers in Emery\u2019s career so far suggest he is that. Whether Stan Kroenke cares about any of this no one knows, but if Emery isn\u2019t on the brink he should be, and another poor performance against Palace would constitute yet more evidence for an already overwhelming prosecution. <strong>DH</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Arsenal v Crystal Palace, 4.30pm Sunday</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/24/arsenal-vitoria-guimaraes-europa-league-match-report\">P\u00e9p\u00e9 double rescues Arsenal after Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es threaten upset</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) It\u2019s time for United\u2019s players to stand up</h2> <p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has copped for a lot of unfair flak lately: clearing up the mess he inherited needs more time than he has had and more money than he has been given, on top of which any team would struggle without six first-choice players. But United\u2019s lack of ideas against opponents who do not oblige their fast players by leaving space in behind for them to run into speaks badly of the work done in training, and until that improves, playing for United will be as much of a struggle as watching them. At Norwich, though, this should not be a problem, because the hosts will look to ask questions of a defence that struggles to keep clean sheets \u2013 United have led against Wolves, Southampton, Arsenal and Liverpool, only to end up drawing all four games. The problem here is not one of preparation but of application, and responsibility for that lies not with the management but the players. It is about time they stood up, and for Harry Maguire to grow into as indomitable, influential, inspirational a leader as his reputation tells us he already is. <strong>DH</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Norwich City v Manchester United, 4.30pm Sunday</p> <h2>3) Will Spurs use extra man in the middle to good effect?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/22/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-first-step-champions-league\">Spurs badly needed their midweek win</a>, but it is hard to gauge how well they played because their opponents were useless. It did, though, seem like Mauricio Pochettino finally found the formation which best suits his best players. The 4-2-3-1 he deployed against Red Star protects what is now a shaky back four, allows Tanguy Ndombele the freedom to attack, and gets Heung-min Son and Dele Alli close to Harry Kane, with \u00c9rik Lamela picking up any slack in workrate. We can be sure that Liverpool will test this theory. Whatever happens, they will have an extra man in midfield, and whichever trio J\u00fcrgen Klopp selects will have the legs to run Spurs off the pitch. Without Christian Eriksen \u2013 upon whom Pochettino seems to have taken a definitive view \u2013 they lack the touch and nous to pass around them, so must be prepared to spend a lot of time chasing the ball. They can still win by defending well and hoping for Kane or a counter, but the likelihood is that it will take a cleverer plan than that. <strong>DH</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Liverpool v Tottenham, 4.30pm Sunday</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e0dbbf6616dbfd31101fe419f9889bddbd8925b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e0dbbf6616dbfd31101fe419f9889bddbd8925b/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Eriksen has been heavily linked with a move away form Spurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Eriksen has been heavily linked with a move away form Spurs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Impey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Villa\u2019s tempo-setters to give City a tough time</h2> <p>There\u2019s a lot to like about Dean Smith\u2019s Aston Villa, in particular their midfield axis of Marvelous Nakamba, Jack Grealish and John McGinn. Nakamba\u2019s calm intelligence provides the perfect balance to his more energetic partners, who play with the perfect combination of entitlement and desire, McGinn a tenacious tempo-setter and Grealish an intuitive improviser. Against City, they will be extended like never before, but will know that if they can compete, there are goals to be taken from a vulnerable home defence. Of course, the likelihood is that City will be too good for them, but do not be surprised if Villa give them a run for their money. <strong>DH</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Manchester City v Aston Villa, 12.30pm Saturday</em></p> <h2>5) Ward-Prowse to step up for Saints</h2> <p>A draw at Molineux enabled Southampton to end a run of three consecutive top-flight defeats, but with back-to-back visits to Manchester City looming in the Carabao Cup and Premier League they could really do with taking at least a point when they host Leicester. Southampton have averaged exactly one goal per game in the league and have recently become overly reliant on Danny Ings to score them since he replaced \u00a315m summer acquisition Che Adams as first-choice striker. \u201cI would like to have three, four or five players who are always able to score because this is more important for the team,\u201d said Saints boss Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl, before name-checking Ryan Bertrand and Yan Valery as players who should be contributing more. They are not the only ones. Adams is yet to get off the mark and with just one goal, a penalty against Bournemouth, to his name so far this season, now would be a good time for the curiously out-of-sorts James Ward-Prowse to step up. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Southampton v Leicester, 8pm Friday</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/oct/24/champions-league-rapid-red-cards-and-alligator-attacks-football-weekly-extra\">Champions League, rapid red cards and alligator attacks \u2013\u00a0Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>6) Hard done by Hornets to get that elusive first win</h2> <p>Despite being without a win in their past three games, Bournemouth are likely to be full of confidence as they travel to Vicarage Road to take on a Watford team already on their second manager of the season and winless at the bottom of the table. Or are they? Against Tottenham last weekend, Watford were vastly superior in almost every department apart from the scoreboard and had every right to feel extremely aggrieved at being denied all three points by the reluctance of officialdom to implement VAR as they should. Rather than stew on the comical injustice of it all, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores is likely to have spent the week instructing his players to dwell on the positives of an excellent performance. A repeat at home ought to be enough to see them past their visitors. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Watford v Bournemouth, 3pm Saturday</em></p> <h2>7) Webster should be on Southgate\u2019s England radar</h2> <p>His Premier League career may only be six matches and 540 minutes old but the early evidence is that there is another Brighton defender worth Gareth Southgate keeping an eye on in the form of Adam Webster. It is almost a year since the Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk was capped by his country but, on current form, one of his colleagues could usurp him in the England stakes. Signed for \u00a325m from Bristol City this summer, Webster is comfortable in possession, adept at playing out from the back (so much so he has also operated in defensive midfield) and happy to waltz forward and kick-start attacks \u2013 staples of Southgate\u2019s mantra. That Tyrone Mings was called up to the England squad in September suggests Southgate is open to looking at defensive alternatives, with Michael Keane and John Stones not covering themselves in glory in recent outings.

      "bodyText": "1) Palace to push Emery to the brink? Did Arsenal fans really humiliate the great Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \u2026 for this? At no point in Unai Emery\u2019s tenure has it been possible to fathom a plan, and the longer things go, the worse they look. There are just so many questions: why is he so reticent to play Lucas Torreira in his position? How can he leave Mesut \u00d6zil out of his matchday squads when his team struggle to create chances? Watching Arsenal\u2019s youngsters play in the cups, you can\u2019t help but wonder if their abandon and cohesion will last only as long as it takes for him to impose himself upon them. Realistically, to make the club competitive again will require someone brilliant, and none of the key markers in Emery\u2019s career so far suggest he is that. Whether Stan Kroenke cares about any of this no one knows, but if Emery isn\u2019t on the brink he should be, and another poor performance against Palace would constitute yet more evidence for an already overwhelming prosecution. DH \u2022 Arsenal v Crystal Palace, 4.30pm Sunday 2) It\u2019s time for United\u2019s players to stand up Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has copped for a lot of unfair flak lately: clearing up the mess he inherited needs more time than he has had and more money than he has been given, on top of which any team would struggle without six first-choice players. But United\u2019s lack of ideas against opponents who do not oblige their fast players by leaving space in behind for them to run into speaks badly of the work done in training, and until that improves, playing for United will be as much of a struggle as watching them. At Norwich, though, this should not be a problem, because the hosts will look to ask questions of a defence that struggles to keep clean sheets \u2013 United have led against Wolves, Southampton, Arsenal and Liverpool, only to end up drawing all four games. The problem here is not one of preparation but of application, and responsibility for that lies not with the management but the players. It is about time they stood up, and for Harry Maguire to grow into as indomitable, influential, inspirational a leader as his reputation tells us he already is. DH \u2022 Norwich City v Manchester United, 4.30pm Sunday 3) Will Spurs use extra man in the middle to good effect? Spurs badly needed their midweek win, but it is hard to gauge how well they played because their opponents were useless. It did, though, seem like Mauricio Pochettino finally found the formation which best suits his best players. The 4-2-3-1 he deployed against Red Star protects what is now a shaky back four, allows Tanguy Ndombele the freedom to attack, and gets Heung-min Son and Dele Alli close to Harry Kane, with \u00c9rik Lamela picking up any slack in workrate. We can be sure that Liverpool will test this theory. Whatever happens, they will have an extra man in midfield, and whichever trio J\u00fcrgen Klopp selects will have the legs to run Spurs off the pitch. Without Christian Eriksen \u2013 upon whom Pochettino seems to have taken a definitive view \u2013 they lack the touch and nous to pass around them, so must be prepared to spend a lot of time chasing the ball. They can still win by defending well and hoping for Kane or a counter, but the likelihood is that it will take a cleverer plan than that. DH \u2022 Liverpool v Tottenham, 4.30pm Sunday 4) Villa\u2019s tempo-setters to give City a tough time There\u2019s a lot to like about Dean Smith\u2019s Aston Villa, in particular their midfield axis of Marvelous Nakamba, Jack Grealish and John McGinn. Nakamba\u2019s calm intelligence provides the perfect balance to his more energetic partners, who play with the perfect combination of entitlement and desire, McGinn a tenacious tempo-setter and Grealish an intuitive improviser. Against City, they will be extended like never before, but will know that if they can compete, there are goals to be taken from a vulnerable home defence. Of course, the likelihood is that City will be too good for them, but do not be surprised if Villa give them a run for their money. DH \u2022 Manchester City v Aston Villa, 12.30pm Saturday 5) Ward-Prowse to step up for Saints A draw at Molineux enabled Southampton to end a run of three consecutive top-flight defeats, but with back-to-back visits to Manchester City looming in the Carabao Cup and Premier League they could really do with taking at least a point when they host Leicester. Southampton have averaged exactly one goal per game in the league and have recently become overly reliant on Danny Ings to score them since he replaced \u00a315m summer acquisition Che Adams as first-choice striker. \u201cI would like to have three, four or five players who are always able to score because this is more important for the team,\u201d said Saints boss Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl, before name-checking Ryan Bertrand and Yan Valery as players who should be contributing more. They are not the only ones. Adams is yet to get off the mark and with just one goal, a penalty against Bournemouth, to his name so far this season, now would be a good time for the curiously out-of-sorts James Ward-Prowse to step up. BG \u2022 Southampton v Leicester, 8pm Friday 6) Hard done by Hornets to get that elusive first win Despite being without a win in their past three games, Bournemouth are likely to be full of confidence as they travel to Vicarage Road to take on a Watford team already on their second manager of the season and winless at the bottom of the table. Or are they? Against Tottenham last weekend, Watford were vastly superior in almost every department apart from the scoreboard and had every right to feel extremely aggrieved at being denied all three points by the reluctance of officialdom to implement VAR as they should. Rather than stew on the comical injustice of it all, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores is likely to have spent the week instructing his players to dwell on the positives of an excellent performance. A repeat at home ought to be enough to see them past their visitors. BG \u2022 Watford v Bournemouth, 3pm Saturday 7) Webster should be on Southgate\u2019s England radar His Premier League career may only be six matches and 540 minutes old but the early evidence is that there is another Brighton defender worth Gareth Southgate keeping an eye on in the form of Adam Webster. It is almost a year since the Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk was capped by his country but, on current form, one of his colleagues could usurp him in the England stakes. Signed for \u00a325m from Bristol City this summer, Webster is comfortable in possession, adept at playing out from the back (so much so he has also operated in defensive midfield) and happy to waltz forward and kick-start attacks \u2013 staples of Southgate\u2019s mantra. That Tyrone Mings was called up to the England squad in September suggests Southgate is open to looking at defensive alternatives, with Michael Keane and John Stones not covering themselves in glory in recent outings. Webster, who scored his first Brighton goal at Aston Villa last weekend, has impressed in blue-and-white stripes and it may not be long before the clamour for the 24-year-old to appear in an England shirt builds. BF \u2022 Brighton v Everton, 3pm Saturday 8) West Ham need to showcase top-six mettle Things were looking relatively rosy for West Ham but three defeats from their past four matches, including a 4-0 loss at Oxford United, has given Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side something of a reality check.

With Callum Hudson-Odoi returning to the fold and another three academy graduates central to Chelsea\u2019s six-match winning streak \u2013 Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham \u2013 it begs the question as to which youngster could be next in line to flourish in the first team.

      "bodyText": "The number of vaccinations given to pre-school children is declining, with the government\u2019s 2013 reorganisation of the NHS identified as a major factor, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has found. The National Audit Office found limited evidence of any major impact from so called \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d who have been blamed for spreading rumours about side effects. Instead, the NAO found several possible reasons for dropping vaccination rates, including the timing and availability of GP appointments and parents needing childcare. Auditors confirmed fears that one in every seven children by the age of five have not been given the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab. NHS England missed the 95% uptake target for six out of seven pre-school jabs in 2018-19, following a general downward trend since 2012-13. Take up of the booster for haemophilus influenzae type B and meningitis C vaccines, known as Hib/MenC, had never exceeded the 95% target and continued to fall, the NAO said in a report released on Friday. One significant factor identified by auditors was the Conservative former health secretary Andrew Lansley\u2019s 2013 reorganisation of the NHS, auditors said. \u201cThere is evidence that the 2013 health system reorganisation in England resulted in fragmentation in the way the vaccination programme has been delivered,\u201d the report concludes. Auditors said that responsibility for vaccinations before 2013 was mixed between primary care trusts and service providers, who manage children\u2019s clinical care records. This was then passed on to NHS England after the reorganisation, the report said. \u201cNHS England has not set out requirements of GPs for call/recall under the changed arrangements. As a result, call/recall is done inconsistently and there is no coherent system,\u201d the report said.

Measles cases have been rising across Europe and the World Health Organization withdrew the UK\u2019s measles-free status earlier this year, granted three years ago, because of the outbreaks. The report said children were called for vaccines to \u201cvarying extent by GP practices\u201d and also by regional Child Health Information Services. But while NHS England checks how call and recall is handled by CHIS, it does not review the work done by GPs. Auditors also found that NHS England and PHE \u201cdo not use a consistent national approach to engage with under-served groups\u201d such as Travellers, who have a low uptake of vaccines. The study found \u201climited evidence of any major impact on vaccination uptake rates\u201d from anti-vaccination messages on social media, but said a \u201csmall minority of parents\u201d had concerns that made them reluctant to vaccinate. While a combination of all these factors appear to be behind falling vaccination rates, NHS England and PHE \u201cdo not know the relative impact of each potential cause\u201d, the study said. The findings come after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said last month that he was seriously considering mandatory vaccination for children. NHS England does not believe that the decline in vaccinations is a result of how it commissions services from GPs. In response to the report, it said it would introduce new measures, including boosting the cash given to GPs for ensuring children have MMR, and working to create networks of GP surgeries which could mean more appointments in the evenings and on weekends. It would also introduce a consistent way of reminding people to attend vaccinations, although the details have not yet been agreed with GPs. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said doctors had systems in place to notify patients when childhood vaccinations were due and to follow up children who missed their jabs. \u201cHowever, these systems will be on a practice-by-practice basis, and we would agree with the NAO that a more standardised approach would be a sensible measure to consider,\u201d she said. She said GPs \u201ctry to be as flexible as possible\u201d in offering appointments at certain times, but doctors were \u201cworking under intense resource and workforce pressures\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a top ally of Donald Trump, introduced a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a \u201cclosed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry\u201d as evidence against the president continues to mount. Graham announced the move on Thursday afternoon and said the Senate\u2019s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, is a co-sponsor of the resolution, demanding that Republicans be given more chances to question witnesses. The nonbinding resolution gives Senate Republicans the chance to show support for Trump at a moment when the president is urging his GOP allies to get tougher and fight harder for him as the House impeachment inquiry gathers momentum a month into the process. \u201cIf you can drive down a president\u2019s poll numbers by having proceedings where you selectively leak information, where the president who\u2019s the subject of all this is pretty much shut out, God help future presidents,\u201d Graham said. Rather than attacking the substance of the evidence investigators are accumulating, Republicans have focused on asserting that House impeachment proceedings have been secretive and unfair. Graham said: \u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you that Donald Trump\u2019s done nothing wrong.\u201d Trump tweeted his thanks for House Republicans, who \u201cstormed\u201d a closed-door committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, disrupting a crucial deposition related to the Ukraine controversy. The chaos and confusion temporarily shut down the proceedings before the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry as Republicans tweeted updates of the disruption from their cellphones, which are not permitted in classified areas. Their presence in the chamber reportedly erupted into yelling matches with committee members. \u201cThank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History. It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam!\u201d Trump tweeted. Many Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the inquiry, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors. The escalation by Republicans comes after Bill Taylor, the most senior US diplomat in Kyiv, testified for hours before House investigators on Tuesday, delivering an account that was so shocking to some lawmakers that freshman Democrat Andy Levin described it as \u201cmy most disturbing day in Congress so far\u201d. In a lengthy opening statement, Taylor said Trump wanted \u201ceverything\u201d, including military aid to Ukraine, tied to a commitment by Ukrainian leaders to investigate Democrats and the 2016 election plus a company linked to the family of Trump\u2019s leading 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden. Taylor said Trump \u201cwanted President Zelenskiy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations\u201d. Republicans have largely sought to attack the inquiry on procedural grounds, objecting to the private nature of the hearings and demanding access to the full breadth of the testimony that has rattled Washington in recent weeks. Much of the testimony that has been made public, however, and news reports confirm key elements of a whistleblower complaint that set in motion the impeachment inquiry. The investigation centers on reports of Trump withholding military aid and dangling a meeting at the White House for Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in return for favors that would benefit him in domestic US politics.",

Three or four years ago we didn\u2019t have the best start. With the improvement, the belief, with the work of the team, you can achieve anything. This is what Klopp told us. The most difficult part is when you are on the top to stay on the top. When you sometimes drop, it is about showing your inner strength, it is about the character of the team to jump back.</p> <p>\u201cI think we learned about all our mistakes from previous years.

      "bodyText": "Greeting a work colleague and clearing up from the dinner table may not be everyone\u2019s idea of how to transform a football club but Dejan Lovren believes J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s two instructions have changed Liverpool by instilling greater respect inside the changing room. Liverpool host Tottenham on Sunday as unbeaten Premier League leaders and reigning European champions, a far cry to Klopp\u2019s first game as manager just over four years ago when he took a team in 10th place to White Hart Lane for a goalless draw. Lovren is one of the few survivors of the Brendan Rodgers era at Liverpool, although Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho were the central defensive pairing at Spurs that day, and credits the small changes that Klopp made on arrival as laying the foundation for the club\u2019s monumental recovery. \u201cFour years already? I\u2019m getting old,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cWe started to believe when he [Klopp] said: \u2018From doubters to believers.\u2019 He changed things in the club, from small details like saying good morning to everyone, to cleaning your table. I think some part of these details are missing in some clubs. \u201cWe are, I think, raised at my age that when you see an older person you will say, \u2018Good morning.\u2019 It is about respect. When you have this outside of the pitch you will feel it also on the pitch. It is simple things. It is about the food as well. He brought in people who are the best in these positions [the head of nutrition, Mona Nemmer, from Bayern Munich in July 2016], and he knows what he is doing.\u201d Lovren attributes Liverpool\u2019s continued progress under Klopp to strength of character and, as Spurs have shown since losing last season\u2019s Champions League final, he says it is harder to stay at the top of the game than to get there. He added: \u201cIt can change quickly. Three or four years ago we didn\u2019t have the best start. With the improvement, the belief, with the work of the team, you can achieve anything. This is what Klopp told us. The most difficult part is when you are on the top to stay on the top. When you sometimes drop, it is about showing your inner strength, it is about the character of the team to jump back. \u201cI think we learned about all our mistakes from previous years. I think we are on the right path. He said to us it is exceptional that we lost the final against Real Madrid and we came this year and won it; it says a lot about the team.\u201d The Croatia defender made only his third start of the season for Liverpool in Wednesday\u2019s Champions League win at Genk. A first away win in the group stage for two years was, he admits, imperative given the threats posed by Napoli and Red Bull Salzburg in Group E. \u201cWhen you look back we are not the best away team in the Champions League,\u201d Lovren said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say that but it\u2019s the reality. We needed this win, especially because it is quite tight in the group at the moment and we are still have to play Salzburg away. It will still be tough but let\u2019s keep this quality.\u201d Lovren also believes Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s two goals in the 4-1 victory will fuel the midfielder\u2019s confidence after a torrid time with injury: \u201cI\u2019m really glad to see Ox score two goals, even if I told him the second one was lucky \u2026 he didn\u2019t accept that. Great for his confidence and overall he needed that after he did not have so many minutes this season and the injury for last season. It\u2019s great to have him back.\u201d",

It\u2019s a pleasure to play alongside him and you can see how clinical he is in front of goal. Everyone\u2019s been magic with me [since joining from Celtic in the summer].

Celtic top Group E. Nicolas Pepe gets Arsenal out of jail. Arsenal top Group F. Another stunning postage-stamp free-kick. Unai Emery does not move an inch but applauds his record signing\u2019s work. 90 min: Five added minutes at a rocking Celtic Park for the hosts to hang on. Fraser Forster has just clung on to the ball to take the sting out of a Lazio attack. Meanwhile, there will be three added minutes at the Emirates, where Arsenal have another inviting free-kick 20 yards from goal ... Huge. Ryan Christie, who equalised for Celtic, sends in a corner and Christopher Jullien towers above everyone to glance home. 87 min: Rochinha replaces Davidson. 85 min: It is almost deja vu for Pepe and Arsenal \u2013 but Vit\u00f3ria survive another dangerous free-kick from an almost identical position. 82 min: Shkodran Mustafi, of all people, plays a wondrous weighted pass in behind the Vit\u00f3ria defence. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn ghosts in and cuts the ball back for Martinelli, who is already celebrating in his head. Martinelli does almost everything right but Silva makes a fine save. Arsenal have gone up a gear since that exquisite strike. A \u00a372m strike. Wonderful, curling left-footed effort. 79 min: Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s Pepe pulls back Torreira. Arsenal win a free-kick 25-odd yards from goal. Nicolas Pepe fancies it ... 76 min: The big guns are on at Celtic Park. Ciro Immobile has been summoned in place of Correa, with Lazio determined to up the ante after that equaliser. At Arsenal, a lot rests on Pepe making a splash. Owing to Emery making a double change at the break, Arsenal are all out of subs. Elsewhere in the group, Eintracht Frankfurt are two goals to the good, with the Austria defender Martin Hinteregger adding a second. 75 min: Lacazette is booked for dissent and that\u2019s the forward\u2019s last contribution, with record signing Nicolas Pepe on in his place. 72 min: Arsenal are knocking on the door. Torreira and Lacazette have tried to make in-roads. Nicolas Pepe\u2019s arrival is imminent. 70 min: Marcus Edwards, the former Spurs youngster who opened the scoring at the Emirates, is withdrawn. On comes Andr\u00e9 Pereira. Parity at Celtic Park! Ryan Christie applies a sweeping finish across goal after nifty hold-up play by the striker Odsonne Edouard. 64 min: Pepe is on ... but not for Arsenal. Vit\u00f3ria make a change, with Pedro Rodrigues Pepe on for the visitors in place of Andr\u00e9 Almeida. 59 min: Lacazette makes the most of a contretemps with Garc\u00eda \u2013 it\u2019s handbags at most \u2013 but the Frenchman pretends he\u2019s been head butted. Nice try. Garc\u00eda gets a booking for his part in giving Lacazette a minor bump bu the referee\u2019s not buying the Arsenal forward\u2019s theatrics. Lacazette is fortunate to escape a yellow. 55 min: Rennes, who are in Celtic\u2019s group, are having a nightmare at home to Cluj. Not only do they trail 1-0 but the Ligue 1 side are also down to nine men after Eduardo Camavinga joined Edouard Mendy in being sent off. 54 min: Smith Rowe volleys wide! The Arsenal midfielder ends up shinning it for a goal-kick, after good work down the left flank by Tierney, who bombed to the byline before delivering a tricky cross. Tierney\u2019s cross was cleared by the visitors, but only as far as Smith Rowe, who failed to punish Vit\u00f3ria. 51 min: Celtic are yet to get going this half \u2013 and nor are Arsenal. 50 min: Arsenal go to sleep in defence \u2013 again \u2013 and Davidson nips in to head at goal. But his effort is straight at a grateful Mart\u00ednez, who saved from Almeida at his near post moments earlier. 49 min: Mustafi nods wide! The German defender gets up above his marker to meet Dani Ceballos\u2019s beautiful first-time cross, but the execution is not good enough. His header is off target and Vit\u00f3ria surge forward up the other end. 47 min: Smith Rowe does well, really well ... but then Lucas Torreira runs into trouble after picking up the pass. Smith Rowe, the academy graduate from Croydon, has been lively. He has probably been the best of a bad bench thus far. At Celtic Park, Lazio and Celtic renew battle. No changes. 46 min: Arsenal needed to change something \u2013 and Unai Emery has at the break. Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Joe Willock have been withdrawn. Dani Ceballos and Matteo Guendouzi on. Mesut \u00d6zil? He\u2019s at home with his feet up. Europa League half-time scores on the doors: Group A Sevilla 0-0 Dudelange Group B Dynamo Kiev 0-1 Copenhagen Malmo 2-0 Lugano Group C Getafe 0-1 Basel Trabzonspor 0-0 Krasnodar Group D PSV Eindhoven 0-0 LASK Sporting Lisbon 0-0 Rosenborg Group E Celtic 0-1 Lazio Rennes 0-1 Cluj Group F Arsenal 1-2 Vitoria Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 Standard Liege The Scottish Premiership leaders trail at the interval. Bruno Duarte\u2019s goal gives the Portuguese side the lead at the break. Lazio kill Celtic on the counterattack. Manuel Lazzari cuts in from the right flank and smashes the ball beyond a hapless Fraser Forster. Back in north London at the Emirates, Davidson sends a shot just past Emiliano Mart\u00ednez\u2019s left post! The Arsenal goal has been under siege throughout this first half. 38 min: Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s tails are up now. Meanwhile, up at Celtic Park, the winger Callum McGregor lashes an effort at goal \u2013 but his shot is deflected wide. Shambolic defending by Arsenal. So sloppy. Bruno Duarte da Silva punishes Arsenal after Davidson drove forward and rattled a post. It was Ainsley Maitland-Niles who surrendered possession after a hospital pass by Torreira. In fairness Duarte\u2019s finish was better than he will get credit for \u2013 he absolutely rifled it in after seizing on Davidson\u2019s seconds. Arsenal are back to square one. 33 min: Emile Smith Rowe almost adds a second \u2013 but his shot deflects just wide of goal. Smith Rowe was slid in by Joe Willock. Arsenal have woken up. Gabriel Martinelli nods in Kieran Tierney\u2019s cross. It was a wonderful ball in from the left and the teenager, left unmarked in the box, glanced home. It was Tierney\u2019s first meaningful foray down the flank and how Arsenal and Martinelli were rewarded, with the striker heading in to give Unai Emery\u2019s side something to build on after the most lacklustre start imaginable. 29 min: At last, Arsenal seem to be stirring. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn skates down the right and whips in a cross, which Martinelli tries and fails to meet. Arsenal waste the resulting corner but that\u2019s about as good as it\u2019s got thus far. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt lead Standard Liege 1-0 courtesy of Tammy David Abraham. 25 min: Martinelli tries to break from halfway but ultimately the teenager gets crowded out, with Venancio intervening. Credit to Martinelli, who then goes bustling after it \u2013 the Brazilian wants a second bite of the cherry \u2013 but Vit\u00f3ria snuff him out. Meanwhile, get a load of Jamie Jackson\u2019s report from Belgrade: 23 min: H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn is again exposed down the Arsenal right, with the Portuguese side furrowing into a gaping hole left by the full-back. A low cross trickles into the box but Arsenal eventually clear their lines. 21 min: Emery asked his Arsenal players for an aggressive and passionate display. This is not it. They have been lukewarm at best. 17 min: Emile Smith Rowe turns beautifully but the visitors get the block in, just as the Arsenal youngster pulls the trigger. Meanwhile, in Group E, Cluj have taken the lead away to Rennes, with Ciprian Deac striking. Celtic remain level-pegging at 0-0 \u2013 but Ryan Christie has just rattled the woodwork for the hosts. 16 min: Arsenal really have not going. A penny for the thoughts of Mesut \u00d6zil, who continues to up the stakes in the the PR war. Around 15 minutes before kick-off, he tweeted a picture of him training with Robert Pires. 12 min: Arsenal, it is fair to say, are at sixes and sevens defensively. They are all over the shop. The Vit\u00f3ria fans are really enjoying themselves. It was some finish from Edwards. The former Spurs winger strikes. Of course. The 20-year-old, who was born in Camden Town, a stone\u2019s throw from the Emirates, opens the scoring. It is a brilliant finish but Edwards wrings both Kieran Tierney and H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn inside out, twisting and turning in the box before getting the shot off, firing across goal. Arsenal did not heed that earlier warning. 5 min: It has not been the most riveting start at the Emirates. Andr\u00e9 Almeida was allowed to swivel inside the box by Rob Holding and the Portuguese fired off a shot but, in the end, it lacked conviction. It was a well-worked move, with Vit\u00f3ria scooting in off the right. At Celtic, a goal-saving block by Jacinto Quissanga prevents Odsonne Edouard from giving the hosts an early lead. A reminder of the team news: Arsenal v Vit\u00f3ria Arsenal: Martinez; Beller\u00edn, Mustafi, Holding, Tierney; Torreira, Willock; Maitland-Niles, Smith Rowe, Martinelli; Lacazette Subs: Leno, Chambers, Kolasinac, Ceballos, Guendouzi, Pepe, Saka Vit\u00f3ria: Silva; Garcia, Venancio, Tapsoba, Hanin; Almeida, Agu, Poha; Edwards, Duarte, Davidson Subs: Douglas, Pedrao, Bonatini, Rochinha, Mohamed, Pereira, Pepe Celtic v Lazio Celtic: Forster; Elhamed, Jullien, Ajer, Bolingoli-Mbombo; Brown, McGregor; Forrest, Christie, Elyounoussi; Edouard Subs: Gordon, Bauer, Hayes, Bitton, Sinclair, Rogic, Bayo Lazio: Strakosha; Bastos, Vavro, Acerbi; Lazzari, Parolo, Leiva, Milinkovic-Savic, Jony; Caicedo, Correa Subs: Marchi, Gil, Berisha, Immobile, Lulic, Guerrieri, Cataldi Anyway, that\u2019s us \u2013 Ben Fisher will take you through the rest of the night. Arsenal are coming out against Vitoria - they line up like this: AZ giving Astana six tells you all you need to know about United. They are rotten. Let\u2019s round up the other results *performs extremely James Alexander Gordon voice*: Besiktas 1-2 Braga Roma 1-1 Gladbach CSKA 0-1 Ferencvaros Qarabag 2-2 Apoel Ludogorets -1 Espanyol St Etienne 1-1 Oleksandriya Gent 2-2 Wolfsburg Istanbul Basaksehir 1-0 Wolfsberg AZ 6-0 Astana In the studio, Paul Scholes and Robin van Persie are laying into United, with sadness. Scholes laments the fact that there is no good football, no little moves to enjoy, no signs of progress. He notes that they only look dangerous on the counter \u2013 otherwise, they\u2019re painful to watch. That\u2019s very impressive from Wolves, who were much improved in the second half. If they win the return in two weeks, they\u2019ll be very nearly through. What a result that is! Rangers earned the everything out of that, solid at the back and in goal, committed in midfield and aggressive in attack. They sit second in the group with four points; Porto have four points too, while Young Boys have six and Feyenoord three. United win away for the first time since March, for the first time in five weeks their defence has seen out an odd-goal advantage, and they\u2019re nearly. That\u2019s the good news; the bad news is that they looked pretty poor while so doing, producing almost no decent football and needing a penalty to shade miserable opponents. Three additional minutes in Oporto... Four additional minutes in Bratislava... Three additional minutes in Belgrade... I\u2019m afraid I missed what happened, but he went for two bookable offences. Can Wolves hang on? McGregor to the rescue! What a double save! First, when a ball is flighted to the far post, he saves Soares\u2019 volleyed shot, and then, when Luiz tees up Danilo, he extends a foot to save again. Barisic curls just over the top. Morelos seizes on a loose pass and sets off towards goal. He\u2019s forced wide and Pepe doesn\u2019t need asking twice, upending him as soon as there\u2019s no risk of a red card. Free-kick Rangers, just outside the box, right of centre; Gerrard brings on Arfield and Ojo for Barker and Jack, Braga now lead in Istanbul. If the scores stay as are, they\u2019ll be top of the group with seven points, in front of Wolves with six, Bratislava with four and Besiktas with 1. And have a look! Partizan win a corner, it goes to Asano at the near post, and he contorts nicely to send a header goalwards as Williams charges the space, playground style, but Romero makes a really smart reaction save. United, though, do not like clean sheets. Bloody hell, it\u2019s been a good few days for Andreas Pereira. First, he does well against Liverpool, now he\u2019s coming on for James Garner like he\u2019s some sort of first choice, as United try and hold on for the win. Rangers are giving as good as they get in Oporto. \u201cWill you please stop interrupting the discussion of City of God with meaningless references to football, please?\u201d asks Andy Wilson. \u201cOut Goodfellas Goodfellas.\u201d It\u2019s rare to see a film whose aesthetic is so overwhelming, but that is one. The pace is also perfect, absorbingly quick, but slow when it needs to be. In United\u2019s group, AZ are 2-0 up at home to Astana. Most likely, everyone else beats them twice so the group will be decided by the three-way between United, Partizan and AZ. In Wolves\u2019 group, Besiktas have equalised against Braga. Nice from Partizan, Nacho into Soumah, who touches off first-time for Sadiq, who spanks low and just wide. United are struggling to get out here. For example... \u201cThe photo of Morelos celebrating his goal for Rangers made me do a double take,\u201d emails Peter Oh. \u201cI don\u2019t recall Rangers ever having worn red in the past. Could it be the influence of their Liverpool legend of a manager? Come on you Reds!\u201d I seem to recall some McEwan\u2019s Lager red yins in the 90s \u2013 union flag and all that. \u201cWith the talent coming through, it\u2019s even more baffling to give new deals to the likes of Smalling, Young, Jones and Mata,\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cAll peripheral players - to even further block the progress of the kids. I\u2019d rather see Williams on the left than Young, but then I thought Borthwick-Jackson looked decent when he first got a run of games.\u201d Two brilliant low crosses at Stamford Bridge, if I remember correctly. Smalling did an ok job last season and I\u2019d have kept him over Jones if i could, promoted Tuanzebe and spent the Maguire money on a midfielder or two. Mata, I think, is there for the dressing room and as a potential coach, but yes, I\u2019d have lozzed him and all. Young i\u2019d have kept because he\u2019s one of few who knows what a good team needs, but I\u2019d not be picking him ahead of Williams or Laird at this point. It\u2019s getting tasty in Belgrade, with Nacho and Miletic booked in quick succession. Jimenez skips into the ball and the keeper moves to his right, so the slot goes the other way. Wolves have been excellent second half. Vinagre crosses, the defender shoves Jimenez, and the ref has an easy call to make. United make a double change, replacing Martial and Wan-Bissaka, who will be needed at the weekend, with Rashford and James. I\u2019m not sure about that one - I guess that if they win here they\u2019re nearly through, but those two need a rest and will definitely start at Norwich on Sunday. I\u2019d prbably have spared both the trip. Wolves respond by bringing on Jota for Gibbs-White. Oh dear. Saiss is allowed room to shoot from distance, strikes across the ball but not cleanly, and Greif waits until the last second to decide that needs to save it even so, and it bobbles past him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a masterpiece,\u201d says Peter Cocker of City of God. I agree. I\u2019d go as far as to say that it\u2019s perfect. Wolves are well on top now; United have done nothing so far this half. What a save! Rangers break again, Barisic slings over another lovely cross, and Morelos is up again! He makes great contact too, but heads too close to Marchesin, who adjusts hands brilliantly to shove over the top. Dear oh dear! Soumah runs at Maguire who sells himself like a cheap thrill, diving in and opening up the way to goal. But Soumah panics, rushing his shot that bobbles wide. In Bratislava, Nuno has introduced Traore and he\u2019s already made a difference, just missing Jimenez with a cross after a charge down the right. Soumah runs at Jones who again does well, standing strong, somehow refraining from giving away a penalty, and seeing the danger away. It\u2019s kind of strange how Solskjaer has handled his young players, only giving them minutes when he\u2019s got no choice or when games are nearly over. Mason Greenwood looks ready, and Brandon Williams looks better than both Shaw and Young to me, and given that United are aiming to be competitive in a year or two, not not, worth giving a run. Nacho goes low with the free-kick, from 20 yards and left of centre, bobbling it past the far post. That\u2019s a brilliant challenge. I\u2019m not sure how the ref has apprised a foul there. Sadiq gets away again, Jones makes what looks like a really good challenge, and the ref gives a free-kick on the edge. Off we go again in Belgrade. \u201c I think my Sunday league team circa 1976 would have given this Partizan team a game,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cThey really are *anglo saxon*. Then again, Martial seems unable to even pick the right studs. Huh, cue him scoring!\u201d A mate in the away end sent me this: Me: Got your binoculars? Him: It\u2019s not that bad as it goes. Me: The further away the better, I guess. Him: Yes! Elsewhere: in Wolves\u2019 group, Braga now lead away to Besiktas. Porto have been comfortably the better side, but Rangers have still threatened and their goal was a peach. I wonder how long it\u2019ll be till we see Neves and Jonny because Wolves have played ok, but are lacking their usual control. United started fairly but the penalty came just as Partizan were asserting themselves. Barisic gets down the left and crosses low and long to the far side of the box, where Morelos collects and absolutely buries an expert\u2019s finish inside the near post. That is very, very well done. The keeper dives to his left and Martial eases the ball to his right. It\u2019s not as comic as when Pogba misses, but it serves a different purpose. Williams dashes into the box, Pavlovic shoves him then trips him, and that\u2019s a penalty! Partizan are crying, but I really can\u2019y see why. Here comes Sadiq again, finding Asano, and though Jones robs him, he\u2019s already on the way down, and his momentum sends him right into the ball, conjuring a shot which goes wide. It\u2019s all kicking off! Sadiq, Partizan\u2019s leading scorer, picks up a loose ball just outside the United box, advances, and caresses a glorious curling sidefooter onto the post, about halfway up! Eeek! Morelos climbs high to power-glance a header onto the bar! On the bench, Gerrard makes that face I know you\u2019re picturing. Lingard hits the post! Wan-Bissaka does really well to win the ball on the edge of the Partizan box, tees him up, and from 20 yards, he carefully places an effort against the base of the woodwork. Rangers, silky devils that they are, try to play their way out when clearing a corner. Someone \u2013 Jack, I think \u2013 finds Luis Diaz, just outside the box, and he skips infield a little before unfurling a delicious curler that hisses and spits its way past McGregor. Bratislava are looking ok against Wolves now; the other game in that group, Besiktas v Braga, is 0-0. Oh! Ze Luis climbs high and hangs long to fling a header against the post. Porto are coming. Goal in Rome! The excellent Zaniolo has put the home side ahead against Gladbach. Wolfsburg now lead 2-0 in Gent; Apoel have equalised at Qarabag. ...Alex Telles curls over the bar. Young Boys now lead Feyenoord 2-0; they currently sit top of Rangers\u2019 group. Meanwhile, Morelos gives the ball away, Marega nashes towards the box, and Jack bumps him over. He\u2019s booked, and Porto have a free-kick... Rangers are doing well yakno, and get the ball out to Tavernier, nicely bouncing in front of him. But he doesn\u2019t get his knee over it, lashing high and then some. I\u2019ve been watching United for more than 35 years now, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen less compelling football than in the Europa League group stages. I guess there are too many teams in the Champions League, but though the current standard isn\u2019t great, that it\u2019s improved massively in the era is unarguable. A nice pass from Garner finds Wan-Bissaka, and the ball goes back to McTominay. He has a man free outside him but opts to shoot \u2013 I don\u2019t think anyone will chastise him for that, given hwo scared United usually are of the same \u2013 and doesn\u2019t catch it perfectly, so it lopes just wide. Back in Oporto, Kent has another run, winning a corner. It goes short, but the eventuating shot \u2013 I didn\u2019t see whose \u2013 is blocked. Goals not in our featured games: Qarabag 1-0 Apoel Ludogorets 0-1 Espanyol St Etienne 1-1 Oleksandriya Young Boys 1-0 Feyenoord Pavlovic clatters Martial as they contest a high ball, and that\u2019s a free-kick to United, 25 yards out, left of centre. I don\u2019t think Mata can kick the ball as far as the goal, but he can curl a luscious cross onto McTominay\u2019s brow! But, not for the first time, he misses a free header; what an oversight that is. As I was saying! With their first attack, a goal! A fine pass with the outside of the foot sends Sporar away at inside-left, and when you\u2019re in nick you\u2019re in nick! He slows Coady down, moves off, and his shot clips the defender on its way inside the near post. It\u2019s been a quiet start in Bratislava, but the territorial advantage is with Wolves. Extremely tangentially, I rewatched City of God for the first time in years the other night. I cannot remember being so dazzled, visually and thematically, since the first day I saw it, when I went to the cinema in the afternoon, then again in the evening. Any more for any more? At the Dragao, Corona has just slung over a lovely cross that Ze Luis headed wide. \u201cPlease explain for me Ed Woodward\u2019s disparaging comments about Daley Blind,\u201d requests Robert Hisnay. \u201cWho would you rather have, Rojo or Blind?\u201d As someone who hates United marginally less than every other football club in the world, I was sad to see Blind leave United. I think what happened was that they needed to raise money and he was one of very few any other club wanted. Mourinho never fancied him though \u2013 when he arrived, he didn\u2019t even list him as a centre-back, was then forced to play him there, dropped him as soon as he made a mistake and never really acknowledged his role in the Europa League win. He is in different league to Rojo and also quite the dish. Porto win a corner which Goldson heads clear and immediately Kent is on his bike, running through the first challenge and screeching all the way to the other box before his touch forsakes him. That\u2019s exactly what Gerrard has planned. Wolfsburg have taken the lead in Gent. Decent move by United down the right, featuring Jones and Lingard, but Wan-Bissaka can\u2019t find a cross. He\u2019ll need to improve that part of his game if United are to make this system work - and I actually wonder whether, long-term, he might just make a centre-back. The raw materials are all there. First of many: Marcos Rojo clips aimlessly forward ... though not via rabona. We\u2019re away in Oporto ... and Belgrade... The Dragao is extremely unfull, and perhaps that\u2019ll help Rangers. They\u2019ve taken a decent contingent, who can make themselves heard in the proper manner. I should note that Nuno has picked a strong team in Bratislava. I daresay he fancies a long run in this competition and why not? Wolves are an absolute bastard to play against, and have the attackers to give any team agita. The players are tunnelled... \u201cThe improved performance against Liverpool has me hopeful about United again,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cIn my optimism I see us winning the Europa, finishing third in the league, signing the Norwegian Beast, and challenging for the title next season. Ah, hope...\u201d United could still make the top four \u2013 when people criticise them, they forget to note that they\u2019ve been missing six of their first XI. I\u2019d still have spent the Maguire money on the midfield, but I understand why Solskjaer didn\u2019t. Steven Gerrard tells BT that his team need to show belief in and out of possession, have a structure and defend aggressively. He also says that his ball-carriers and fast players \u2013 his \u201cone v one merchants\u201d \u2013 have to take responsibility when they can, but he accepts that Porto will have a lot of the ball. He\u2019s looking forward to watching Barker, who\u2019s been picked with that in mind. Partizan were meant to be playing behind closed doors after racism from their crowd, but managed to get around the ban on a technicality, giving tickets away for free to kids and such. In the BT studio, Robin van Persie makes the point that walking off should not be a responsibility foisted upon the players \u2013 the officials should intervene on their behalf. Other things to note about United\u2019s XI: Martial, whose ambling shift against Liverpool was not at all good but whom United have unarguably missed, returns from the start; Lingard, who\u2019s been horrible for months, is also back; and Jimmy Garner, who is now far too good for age-group football, makes his first start. I believe there are reservations about his power and speed, but he\u2019s an intelligent and incisive passer of the ball. So, do Manchester United now play 3-5-2? That they\u2019re doing so tonight, with radically different personnel to those who played against Liverpool, suggests a policy decision. And it\u2019s not an inexplicable decision, given a surfeit a centre-backs and an absence of wingers. The question is whether something that worked against Liverpool, who demand a special plan, is necessarily something that will work all the time. In the end, it\u2019s not possible to hide that midfield and that\u2019s all there is to it. Slovan Bratislava: Greif; Medvedev, Abena, Bozhikov, De Marco; Ibrahim, De Kamps; Daniel, Holman, Rharsalla; Sporar. Subs: Sulla, Ljubicic, Drazic, Ratao, Nono, Bajric, Cavric.

Right, let\u2019s have some teams... Thursday night, five to six, Thursday night, five to six. But of course! What else is to drink do at that time of the week, other than watch yet another football match? Exactly! For those who like their football awful and hilarious, we have Partizan v Manchester United \u2013 United\u2019s games against Astana and AZ were epochally awful, and there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get to enjoy more of the same. Elsewhere, Rangers visit Porto, an enticing fixture in the first instance, but one which acquires an entirely new dimension when it puts Pepe will be be in direct proximity to Alfredo Morelos. Oooh yeah! And Wolves are also in action, away at Slovan Bratislava, though the pick of the ties \u2013 wait for it, because you\u2019re not going to believe me \u2013 doesn\u2019t involve a British club. I know! But believe me, it\u2019s true, because we\u2019ve got Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Bundesliga leaders, entertaining Roma, sixth in Serie A! And these are just the early games! Later on, we\u2019ve got Arsenal-Vit\u00f3ria, Celtic-Lazio ... and they\u2019re live! Kick-offs \u2013 or should that be kicks-off \u2013 5.55pm BST.",

Paris had no intention of giving ultimatums or confrontations over a Brexit extension \u2013 but London must provide clear, precise, organised reasons for an extension.</p> \n  <p>Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin said the EU simply giving more time would solve nothing unless there was concrete action in place in the UK. She told RTL radio:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our position is that simply giving more time \u2013 without political change, without ratification, without an election - would be useless.</p> \n   <p>The French position is to give more time if it is justified, if we understand why more time is needed. That could be more time to ratify, because there\u2019s a deal on the table. Or it could be because they say want to hold elections. Then we\u2019ll look at that.</p> \n   <p>But it\u2019s one thing to say we\u2019d like to maybe have elections and another thing to say elections have been organised.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She denied France wanted to give Britain an ultimatum.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019re partners. We live 50km from each other. We\u2019ll stay strong partners and neighbours, we\u2019ll have a future relationship. So this is not about an ultimatum, it\u2019s about getting clarity.</p> \n   <p>We need clarity ... so our work is not about giving ultimatums, nor confrontation. But we do need to know why we would be giving more time. Simply giving more time alone leads to getting stuck in a rut.</p> \n   <p>If there\u2019s a clear scenario that will change things, for example a ratification or elections \u2013 not just suggested but organised \u2013 then we can take decisions. But we ask Britain for facts \u2013 we\u2019re not in fictional politics, we need facts to make decisions.</p> \n   <p>Decisions will be taken in the next hours and days in terms of what the UK parliament says and what has really been actioned [in the UK].</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db1f2648f08142786c50acd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-24T18:57:14.505Z\">7.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour will only support the prime minister\u2019s push for a general election if a no-deal Brexit is taken \u201coff the table\u201d, <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> has said.</p> \n  <p>He declined to say whether or not Labour will back moves for an election if the Commons votes on the matter on Monday.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister dropped his key \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to bring the UK out of the European Union on 31 October. Boris Johnson demanded a general election on 12 December, offering MPs more time to scrutinise his Brexit legislation if they agreed. It was unclear whether he would get his wish after Labour indicated it would not back an election unless a no-deal Brexit was ruled out altogether. Boris Johnson needs Labour\u2019s support to call an election and, while the party\u2019s leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted one, he would not back it until a hard Brexit was taken off the table. MPs backed the government\u2019s legislative programme. The Commons voted through the Queen\u2019s speech motion by a majority of 16. Johnson is likely to be left waiting for the EU\u2019s terms for a further Brexit extension until Friday, with signs of momentum building behind Donald Tusk\u2019s plan for a delay up to 31 January. The French government has privately voiced its concerns about taking the pressure off MPs to vote for the deal, which they believe could be ratified in 15 days, but EU sources said the bloc was seeking a \u201csolution that works for all\u201d and avoids a no-deal exit. The Liberal Democrat leader wrote to Jeremy Corbyn urging Labour to support her party\u2019s amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech, which would ensure a second Brexit referendum. Jo Swinson tweeted a copy of the letter, which read: \u201cI believe we cannot afford to wait any longer if we are going to get a people\u2019s vote in this parliament.\u201d Key Brexit legislation was not included in the Commons business for next week. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told MPs the business would include the second reading of the environment bill on Monday, among other matters. The DUP angrily chastised the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, with one of the party\u2019s MPs saying unionists had been the \u2018sacrificial lambs\u2019 of the Brexit deal. Barclay was presented with the prime minister\u2019s earlier promise there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. \u201cIt is the case the prime minister was distinguishing between the paperwork that is required, which will be done digitally and is a single form, rather than actually introducing physicals checks,\u201d he responded. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Daniel Boffey have the full story: France\u2019s Europe minister insisted on Thursday night that Paris had no intention of giving ultimatums or confrontations over a Brexit extension \u2013 but London must provide clear, precise, organised reasons for an extension. Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin said the EU simply giving more time would solve nothing unless there was concrete action in place in the UK. She told RTL radio: Our position is that simply giving more time \u2013 without political change, without ratification, without an election - would be useless. The French position is to give more time if it is justified, if we understand why more time is needed. That could be more time to ratify, because there\u2019s a deal on the table. Or it could be because they say want to hold elections. Then we\u2019ll look at that. But it\u2019s one thing to say we\u2019d like to maybe have elections and another thing to say elections have been organised. She denied France wanted to give Britain an ultimatum. We\u2019re partners. We live 50km from each other. We\u2019ll stay strong partners and neighbours, we\u2019ll have a future relationship. So this is not about an ultimatum, it\u2019s about getting clarity. We need clarity ... so our work is not about giving ultimatums, nor confrontation. But we do need to know why we would be giving more time. Simply giving more time alone leads to getting stuck in a rut. If there\u2019s a clear scenario that will change things, for example a ratification or elections \u2013 not just suggested but organised \u2013 then we can take decisions. But we ask Britain for facts \u2013 we\u2019re not in fictional politics, we need facts to make decisions. Decisions will be taken in the next hours and days in terms of what the UK parliament says and what has really been actioned [in the UK]. Labour will only support the prime minister\u2019s push for a general election if a no-deal Brexit is taken \u201coff the table\u201d, Jeremy Corbyn has said. He declined to say whether or not Labour will back moves for an election if the Commons votes on the matter on Monday. In an interview this evening, he has said: Take no deal off the table and we will absolutely support an election. I\u2019ve been calling [for] an election ever since the last one because this country needs one in order to deal with all the social injustices but no deal must be taken off the table. Asked what he would do in the event of a vote on Monday on whether or not to hold elections, he said: Tomorrow, the European Union will decide whether there\u2019s going to be an extension granted or not that extension will obviously encompass whether there\u2019s a no deal or not. Let\u2019s find that out tomorrow. Pressed on the matter, he refused to elaborate. Asked what course of action he would define as having taken no deal off the table, he said: No deal is a threat that Boris Johnson has been using all along, and indeed it\u2019s included in his legislation that\u2019s before parliament at the moment; the legislation that he\u2019s paused. I want us to not crash out of the EU because of all the damage it will do to jobs across this country. He said he was unable to say whether the granting of a Brexit extension until the end of next January would satisfy him in that regard. The Press Association is quoting an unnamed N0 10 source as saying the government would pull the withdrawal agreement bill if MPs refused their timetable and instead \u201ccampaign at every stage and at every opportunity for a general election\u201d. Here\u2019s the latest on the shadow cabinet discussions over the prime minister\u2019s general election offer: There are unconfirmed reports around that the government has pulled it plans for a budget on 6 November. Announcing the plans for a budget last Monday, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had said: This will be the first budget after leaving the EU. I will be setting out our plan to shape the economy for the future and triggering the start of our infrastructure revolution. This is the right and responsible thing to do \u2013 we must get on with governing. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has accused the prime minister of \u201ctrying to distract from his government\u2019s failure\u201d in announcing his preferred general election date. He has missed his do-or-die deadline and is now demanding that parliament give him a general election and the time to ram through his bill without proper scrutiny. The Liberal Democrats will not support any election until it is clear that we can avoid crashing out with no deal, and that needs an extension from the EU. The Liberal Democrats have consistently campaigned for a people\u2019s vote as we believe that is the best way to end the Brexit impasse. The failure of Jeremy Corbyn to back us on a people\u2019s vote today means we have missed the chance to deliver it so far in this parliament. Labour MPs are reacting on Twitter to this pretty astonishing piece of research by Cardiff University and the University of Edinburgh, which suggests that a majority of voters in England, Wales and Scotland believe that violence against MPs is a \u201cprice worth paying\u201d in order to get their way on Brexit. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor is reporting that a \u201ctwo tier\u201d extension could be available, where the first extension would be provided to allow MPs to approve the Brexit bill. If the bill did not pass, the EU could then allow a further extension until 31 January. And from the chancellor of the exchequer: This from the Scottish first minister: Some more reaction from MPs. Let\u2019s just take a moment to think about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d promise that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October. This evening\u2019s call for a general election on 12 December is his first admission that he will not deliver on the pledge he said he\u2019d rather \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than break. Here\u2019s a little reminder: It\u2019s looking less and less likely that Johnson will get his election proposal agreed by parliament ... On the question of whether the speaker John Bercow will stay on any longer now the 31 October Brexit deadline has been scrapped, Jacob Rees-Mogg says the timetable is set. Bercow will leave next Thursday and tributes will be paid to him in the house. Some reaction from MPs to the prime minister\u2019s decision to push for an election on 12 December. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, stands up to say that next Monday MPs will be given the opportunity to \u201cdebate and approve a motion relating to an early general election\u201d. The business for the rest of next week remains as he announced earlier. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, says we will find out tomorrow what extension has been granted by the EU. She says the Labour party will back an election once a no-deal Brexit is ruled out and if the extension allows. MPs have voted for the Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 310 to 294. A few minutes ago, before the vote on the SNP amendment, MPs voted on a Labour amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech. They voted against it by 311 to 293. MPs are now voting on the main motion on the Queen\u2019s speech. The result is due in about five minutes. The SNP\u2019s amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech has been voted down by 310 votes to 64. The prime minister has written to the Labour leader setting out his proposals for a general election. He says he is \u201cextremely sceptical that this habit [of voting to delay Brexit] will change and many will doubt that this parliament will do anything other than waste more time\u201d. MPs are now voting on amendments to the motion to approve the Queen\u2019s speech, before they vote on the whole thing. They are currently voting on an SNP amendment that says \u201cthe house regrets the UK government\u2019s intention to use the immigration bill to end freedom of movement within Europe\u201d. Here are Johnson\u2019s comments in a bit more detail. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s political editor, he said: If this parliament is anything to go by, that delay could go on for a very long time because it looks as though our EU friends will respond to parliament\u2019s request by having an extension, which I really don\u2019t want at all. The way to get Brexit done is, I think, to be reasonable with parliament and say if they genuinely want more time to study this excellent deal, they can have it, but they have to agree to a general election on 12 December. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s time, frankly, that the opposition summoned up the nerve to submit themselves to the judgment of our collective boss, which is the people of the UK.\u201d Johnson said his proposal would give MPs \u201call the time they want\u201d to scrutinise the bill before 6 November. He says that\u2019s more than many of them had been asking for. The prime minister said it would be \u201cabsolutely morally incredible\u201d if the Labour party refused to back an election. Boris Johnson has announced he will push for a general election on 12 December. He said parliament voted to delay Brexit and \u201cthat delay could go on for a very long time\u201d because the EU would respond to parliament\u2019s request and agree an extension. The prime minister said he wanted \u201cto be reasonable with parliament\u201d and say they could have more time to scrutinise the legislation if they submitted to a general election on 12 December. Sky News\u2019s Beth Rigby says Johnson will table a motion for a general election on Monday. But remember, the government would still need the support of two-thirds of MPs to hold an election. And Labour has said it will not back an election until the EU has given the UK a Brexit extension. The Lib Dem MP Chuka Umunna says it looks increasingly unlikely that there will be the numbers in parliament for a second referendum because of lack of support from Labour. He says the best way forward is an election. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. The vote on the Queen\u2019s speech could come at 5.45pm, followed by an address by Johnson calling on MPs to back an election. Shadow cabinet members have said Labour would back an election after the EU granted the UK a Brexit extension. (See Long-Bailey this morning and Burgon yesterday morning.) This from the Sun\u2019s political editor. There are mounting reports that Johnson could announce his intention to push for an election this evening. Oh goody ... The vote on the Queen\u2019s speech is expected after 5pm. The vote will be tight and if it is voted down it will be the first time since 1924 that a government has lost a Queen\u2019s speech vote. (That was when Stanley Baldwin\u2019s minority government was defeated. The opposition went on to form a new government.) In less bizarre times you would expect this to result in an election being called, but \u2013 since the introduction of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 \u2013 this would require the backing of two-thirds of MPs. We could find ourselves in the strange situation of having a government that cannot pass its legislative programme but also cannot secure a general election. Downing Street has said Johnson would not resign if he loses a vote on his Queen\u2019s speech. This is a good Queen\u2019s speech explainer from the Institute for Government. If Johnson does decide to push for an election (again) he could well fail to get parliament to vote for it. There is plenty of opposition to the idea among MPs. This is intriguing from Media Guido, reporting that the BBC\u2019s political editor has just gone into Downing Street to conduct an interview with Boris Johnson. Could the prime minister be about to announce that he will push for an election? Some more MPs \u2013 this time Labour ones \u2013 have been expressing concerns over the idea there could be an imminent election. Ex-employment minister Pat McFadden told the BBC: I don\u2019t think we should have an election now. We are in the middle of a huge decision-making moment for the country. The issue before us is Brexit and has been for several years. I think we have a duty to decide the future of that issue and an election should come after that. Former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said: My objection to a general election is one of principle in that with a general election the secret is in the name \u2013 it is general. It\u2019s not and shouldn\u2019t be about a single binary issue like Brexit. Some light relief \u2013 apparently the German word for the withdrawal agreement bill is ... Austrittsvertragsratifizierungsgesetzentwurf Tory backbenchers have been out speaking to broadcasters this lunchtime. They are divided over whether trying to secure an election is a good idea. Crispin Blunt, MP for Reigate, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One: What we\u2019ve got isn\u2019t working, it needs sorting. We need to go to the country as soon as possible to put this parliament out of its misery and give the country an administration that can actually work. David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister under Theresa May, said that, given the lack of clarity in legislation regarding the post-Brexit proposals for Northern Ireland, an election could \u201cfurther put at risk a very fragile political situation in that part of our country\u201d. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, said: I very much support the view that it is much better to get Brexit done. There is no reason at all why we can\u2019t have got over this stage of Brexit by mid-November and at that point [Boris Johnson] will say: \u2018I have now done what I have promised to do\u2019 and this political paralysis that has affected the country for three years is now over. Boris Johnson is holding a meeting of his cabinet around about now, amid disagreements as to whether the government should push for an election or try to get its Brexit bill through parliament. Here\u2019s a full write-up \u2013 by the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll \u2013 of this morning\u2019s urgent question on the implications of the deal for Northern Ireland. The government has been urged to heed the warnings of the risk of civil disorder by loyalists in Northern Ireland because of the sense of betrayal they feel over Brexit. The deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, Nigel Dodds, urged the government not to shrug off the impact of the Brexit deal on the unionist community. \u201cYou are really in danger here of causing real problems with the Belfast agreement, the St Andrew\u2019s agreement, the political institutions and political stability in Northern Ireland by what you are doing to the unionist community,\u201d he told the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, during an hour-long exchange in the House of Commons over the Northern Ireland protocol of the deal. \u201cPlease wake up and realise what is happening here,\u201d he said. BuzzFeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli and Alex Wickham are reporting that Boris Johnson personally raised the issue of businesses having to fill in export forms on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in a phone call with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, on the morning the Brexit deal was agreed. Juncker insisted that the matter could not be renegotiated. Shortly afterwards, in a follow-up call, Johnson agreed the deal, thereby accepting the need for the forms. This shows the PM knew the issue would be problematic, but signed it off anyway. Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, has issued a statement on the confusion surrounding the Northern Ireland/Ireland protocol. The government is in complete disarray about the impact of its sell-out Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. The Brexit secretary says there will be border checks, the prime minister claims there won\u2019t be, and the home secretary cannot say for sure one way or the other. Boris Johnson should come to parliament at the earliest opportunity to clarify the government\u2019s position and apologise for misleading MPs about the consequences of his Brexit deal on trade within the UK. Earlier today the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds criticised the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, for describing the checks envisaged on exports between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as \u201cadministrative processes\u201d, when in reality they were export declarations that would have to be checked. The next president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said Boris Johnson will need to nominate a candidate for EU commissioner to serve in Brussels if Brexit is delayed beyond 31 October. \u201cThere might be an extension and the UK will still be in the EU. Then of course I would ask the UK to send a commissioner,\u201d Von der Leyen told reporters when asked about the repercussions of the UK staying in the EU beyond the end of the month. The prime minister has refused to pick a replacement for Sir Julian King, a Briton who is Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s security commissioner. The home secretary Priti Patel has admitted this week to a select committee that she had yet to meet or talk to King. Should Johnson fail to nominate a commissioner, the UK would be in infringement of EU law. Article 17 (5) TEU of the Lisbon treaty removed the obligation for each member state to be represented in the commission. It stated that any commission must have members from at least two thirds of EU countries. But before the treaty came into force the member states reverted to insisting that any commission must have a member from every EU country. This was made legally binding in 2013. A derogation for the UK could be given under Article 17 (5) TEU. This would require the consent of all 28 member states, including the UK. The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, has this useful guide to what the prime minister\u2019s options are now. And here\u2019s a quick guide \u2013 by our political correspondent Kate Proctor \u2013 to how Boris Johnson could get a general election before January. The Queen\u2019s speech debate is ongoing. The speaker selected two amendments for debate. See below. He did not select the Lib Dem amendment that called for a second EU referendum. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming: And from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: A meeting of the political cabinet \u2013 without civil servants \u2013 will take place at 3pm on Thursday. It\u2019s Frances Perraudin here, taking over from Ben Quinn for the afternoon. \u2022 Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet is divided over how to proceed with Brexit as the prime minister faces the choice of pressing ahead with his deal or gambling his premiership on a pre-Christmas general election. After an inconclusive meeting with Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday morning to try to agree an acceptable timetable for parliament to consider the bill, the prime minister told MPs at Wednesday\u2019s PMQs that he was awaiting the decision of the EU27 over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. The EU\u2019s decision is unlikely to come before Friday. \u2022 Johnson will be left waiting for the EU\u2019s terms for a further Brexit extension until Friday, with signs of momentum building behind Donald Tusk\u2019s plan for a delay up to 31 January. The French government has privately voiced its concerns about taking the pressure off MPs to vote for the deal, which they believe could be ratified in 15 days, but EU sources said the bloc was seeking a \u201csolution that works for all\u201d and avoids a no-deal exit. Tusk, the president of the European council, told Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday his reasons for \u201crecommending the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension\u201d. \u2022 The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has written to Jeremy Corbyn urging Labour to support her party\u2019s amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech which would ensure a second Brexit referendum. Swinson tweeted a copy of the letter, which stated: \u201cI believe we cannot afford to wait any longer if we are going to get a people\u2019s vote in this parliament.\u201d \u2022 Key Brexit legislation has not been included in the Commons business for next week. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told MPs the business will include the second reading of the environment bill on Monday, the second reading of the animal welfare (sentencing) bill on Tuesday, a general debate on the Grenfell Tower fire on Wednesday, and tributes to the Speaker\u2019s chaplain followed by a general debate on children\u2019s services spending on Thursday. The Commons will not sit on Friday 1 November, he added. \u2022 The DUP has angrily chastised the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, in the House of Commons, where one of the party\u2019s MPs said unionists had been the \u2018sacrificial lambs\u2019 of the deal between the EU and the UK. Barclay also referred to comments made by the prime minister on Wednesday when he said there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Responding to this, Barclay said: \u201cIt is the case the prime minister was distinguishing between the paperwork that is required, which will be done digitally and is a single form, rather than actually introducing physicals checks.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is speaking in the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech, which he describes as little more than a crude election stunt. He says the reality is that after almost a decade of harsh and brutal austerity, a few cynical attempts to paper over the cracks in the NHS and elsewhere go nowhere near making a difference. On Brexit, the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard tweets: Much hilarity and some outrage has ensued as a result of reported comments from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, at a town hall meeting of Labour staff that, \u201canyone who knows Jeremy knows he loves to go on the train to obscure places like the south-west or Orkney\u201d. ScotRail, more used to getting pelters on Twitter because of late-running, overcrowded trains, is now enjoying much praise for maintaining a secret under-sea train line to the Orkney Islands, 10 miles from the Scottish mainland, apparently only for use by the Labour leader. At least he\u2019ll get a seat. Residents of the south-west, which has a population of more than 5 million people, were likewise surprised to learn that they were considered obscure. Geography, it\u2019s a tricky subject. The Labour backbencher, Lucy Powell, has said that it would be better to put the Brexit bill through parliament before an election, but if MPs \u201ccan\u2019t resolve\u201d it, then there should be an election. Speaking on Politics Live, she also hit out at the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, who has written to Jeremy Corbyn to seek Labour support for a second referendum amendment. I\u2019ve just come back from the twice-daily lobby briefing, with the PM\u2019s official spokesman. He offered little in the way of defence of Johnson\u2019s refusal to attend this morning\u2019s planned appearance before the House of Commons liaison committee, which infuriated its chair, Sarah Wollaston. Asked what Johnson was doing that was so important, he said: \u201cThroughout the course of the morning the PM has been holding meetings with members of his team and with members of his cabinet,\u201d adding, \u201csince taking office he has spent 14 hours at the dispatch box taking questions from colleagues across the house\u201d. That has only included two sessions of PMQs, of course \u2013 and that belligerent late-night session after the supreme court struck down his prorogation, during which he suggested to MPs the best way to honour their murdered colleague Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. As for whether Johnson will ask parliament to support a general election in the coming days, his spokesman suggested he was awaiting the response of the EU27 to the letter sent on Saturday, requesting a Brexit extension. And he appeared to concede that the 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline looked out of reach, saying: \u201cThat is absolutely what the PM wants to achieve, but at the same time we have to recognise the fact that parliament has handed control of the timetable to the EU.\u201d Since parliament is not sitting tomorrow, the government would have to lay a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act before the end of today\u2019s sitting if it were to be voted on by MPs on Monday. Alternatively, they could await the EU\u2019s response, and then table a motion on Monday, with a vote then held on Tuesday. A PR and lobbying industry body has condemned as \u201cwholly unethical\u201d the hiring of the former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson by a communications firm while she continues to sit in the Scottish parliament. Tulchan Communications, which has offices in London and Singapore, announced Davidson\u2019s appointment as a senior adviser on Wednesday. Francis Ingham, the director general of the Public Relations and Communications Association, which represents more than 30,000 PR practitioners worldwide, said: \u201cIt is simply wrong for lobbying agencies to employ legislators. \u201cThe possible conflict of interest in doing so is clear and damages the reputation of both our industry and of the political process.\u201d Read on The Tory MP, Eddie Hughes, asks Rees-Mogg to confirm that, subject to the outcome of a general election, the government will find time to put precisely the same Brexit deal before the House of Commons. Rees-Mogg replies: It is impossible to guarantee what might happen after a general election because we don\u2019t know what might be in the various manifestos and we don\u2019t know what a new parliament will decide to do. The deal as it currently stands has its second reading. If there were to be an election of course any deals that haven\u2019t completed their passage fall, so there can be no guarantees of that kind. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has written to Jeremy Corbyn urging Labour to support her party\u2019s amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech that would, if passed, ensure a second Brexit referendum. Responding to a question about whether the UK would still be leaving the EU on 31 October, Jacob Rees-Mogg said that this was still the date set in law. \u201cWe do not know what the European Union will do \u2026 and you know that the request for an extension is not the prime minster\u2019s request. It is is the request of the Benn act,\u201d he added. \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s government does not want an extension and it is making every preparation to leave on the 31 October.\u201d As to a question about what happened to the withdrawal agreement bill - not included in next week\u2019s business, for now - Rees-Mogg quotes the fictional regency fop Percy Blakeney (with a slight twist): They seek it here, they seek it there. Those parliamentarians seek it everywhere. Is it in heaven? is it in hell? That damned elusive Brexit bill.. It\u2019s tweets at dawn between the Conservative party\u2019s press office and the former chancellor turned Evening Standard editor, George Osborne. It comes after the Standard carried a piece stating that \u201cConservative chiefs\u201d had sparked a fake news row by claiming that the Brexit deal had already \u201cpassed\u201d parliament. CCHQ press office claims this is simply not true. Osborne replies today: There\u2019s no mention of the withdrawal agreement bill in the House of Commons business for next week \u2013 which has just been read out by the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg. There\u2019s also no mention of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act however. So, no election vote for now \u2026 unless there\u2019s an emergency statement later on. Rees-Mogg told MPs the business will include the second reading of the environment bill on Monday, the second reading of the animal welfare (sentencing) bill on Tuesday, a general debate on Grenfell on Wednesday, and tributes to the Speaker\u2019s chaplain followed by a general debate on children\u2019s services spending on Thursday. The Commons will not sit on Friday 1 November, he added. The European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill is currently in limbo after MPs rejected the government\u2019s attempt to fast-track it through the Commons. The Labour MP Owen Smith says that peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland is far too important to be taken for granted by what he describes as the \u201cobfuscation\u201d exhibited by Barclay. He seeks a response to concerns that consumer prices could go up in Northern Ireland as a result of the protocols and that trade would be hit. Brandishing what would appear to be a copy of the type of form that would need to be completed as part of the checks on exports, Barclay replies: \u201cI don\u2019t think it helps the debate to describe what is a fairly simple form as putting our future trade with Northern Ireland in jeopardy.\u201d The Labour MP, Steve Doughty, wants to know if UK Border Force officials will be involved in any way at any stage in the checks on exports between Northern Ireland and Britain. It\u2019s not quite clear if Barclay gives a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201dno\u201d. \u201cWe will have sovereign control over that as a sovereign country,\u201d he says. The Scottish Liberal Democrat MP, Alistair Carmichael, has reminded Barclay of comments made by the then Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, in a letter to Downing Street last year, which said: We could not support any deal that creates a border of any kind in the Irish Sea and undermines the union or leads to Northern Ireland having a different relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK, beyond what currently exists. This letter was described by a senior Tory as \u201can article of faith\u201d, adds Carmichael, who asks what has changed. Barclay replies: What has shaped these arrangements is that there are unique circumstances in Northern Ireland and that does require unique solutions. There are already unique circumstances pertaining to the Belfast agreement. There is more anger from the DUP benches, with David Simpson asking Barclay if unionists were the \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d that had to be made in order to reach a deal with the EU. Barclay says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t recognise this characterisation\u201d. Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s leader at Westminster, has told Steve Barclay to \u201cwake up\u201d and realise the \u201creal problems\u201d which the Brexit deal was causing for the Belfast agreement, the unionist community and political stability in Northern Ireland. Visibly exasperated, Dodds said that Barclay now called the checks envisaged on exports between Northern Ireland and Britain as \u201cadministrative processes\u201d but in reality they were export declarations that will have to be checked. The government\u2019s own impact assessment says that it has the potential to reduce trade and have an impact on small businesses, Dodds said. \u201cLet\u2019s have a bit of clarity here. You are really in danger of causing real problems with the Belfast agreement, the St Andrews agreement and political stability by what you are doing to the unionist community,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease wake up ... don\u2019t plough ahead regardless.\u201d The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, is taking an urgent question in parliament on Northern Ireland trade, and insists that there is nothing in the protocols in the latest Brexit deal that would stand in the way of \u201cunfettered\u201d movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland As Barclay confirmed this week, firms in Northern Ireland will have to fill out export declaration forms when sending goods to Great Britain under Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. He told MPs today that the electronic forms concerned \u201cfairly straightforward\u201d data in terms of the nature of goods moving across the Irish Sea and who was doing it. \u201cThe issue here is that these are administrative processes that pertain in particular to international obligations \u2013 on things like diamonds, endangered species \u2013 but it is the case that there have been concerns expressed in Northern Ireland and there have been concerns expressed, which I very much respect, from our confidence and supply partners,\u201d he added, looking up towards DUP MPs. The DUP glared back. Raoul Ruparel, a former special adviser to Theresa May, has been sharing some thoughts on an argument behind a political flashpoint this week \u2013 an allegation that Boris Johnson misled MPs after claiming there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and Britain after Brexit. Johnson\u2019s comments appeared to have directly contradicted the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, who admitted on Tuesday that Northern Ireland businesses would be forced to fill out export declaration forms when sending goods to Britain under the terms of the new deal. Here\u2019s Ruparel\u2019s thread: Here\u2019s another view however: Amid splits in the government, Labour and EU, here\u2019s yet another: The Liberal Democrats push for second referendum through a parliamentary amendment unveiled today has caused divisions in the People\u2019s Vote movement, reports the editor of the PoliticsHome, Kevin Schofield. Conservative MPs have secured the majority of key spots reserved to allow backbenchers to introduce legislation in the House of Commons. The Press Association reports that Nigel Mills (Amber Valley) won the private members\u2019 bill ballot, thereby securing first pick when choosing a Friday for his proposed law to begin its journey through the parliamentary process. He finished ahead of Tory colleague John Stevenson (Carlisle), Labour\u2019s Anneliese Dodds (Oxford East) in third and Conservative Anne Marie Morris (Newton Abbot) in fourth. Labour\u2019s Lisa Forbes (Peterborough), Conservative former minister James Brokenshire and Liberal Democrat former leader Sir Vince Cable completed the top seven, who have the best chance of making progress with their draft legislation. Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said 395 MPs put their name forward to be in the ballot, with 20 drawn out for the different slots. He\u2019s currently visiting the French Glorioso Islands off the south-east coast of Africa, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, remains a key figure today amid EU27 deliberations over what type of Brexit extension to grant the UK. While reports this morning suggest that he favours a 15-day delay, by contrast Germany is among the states backing the proposal from the European council president, Donald Tusk,for an extension to 31 January. The Irish Times meanwhile reports that sources in Brussels and Dublin say Macron is unwilling to wave through the extension. EU ambassadors met last night in Brussels but did not agree to the UK\u2019s request. It is believed that the French government does not favour a three-month extension unless the UK commits to an election or a second referendum. However, it would be willing to agree a short extension of a few weeks to enable the British parliament to complete ratification of the treaty. As an election looms, here\u2019s some interesting food for thought in the form of research into what parties can learn from the last time Britons went to the polls in 2017. A summary published today on the LSE\u2019s website suggests that the Tories \u201cwent overboard in their rhetoric on \u2018getting on with the job\u2019 of Brexit, (risking the alienation of their more moderate supporters) and on the robotic message of \u2018strong and stable leadership\u2019.\u201d By contrast, Labour was said to have played a better hand and tapped into most of its electoral strengths. The academics, whose findings have been published in a new edition of West European Politics, add: There is a clear left-wing anti-austerity constituency in Britain, and rather than being out of touch with the public mood, as many New Labour grandees feared, our analysis shows that Labour\u2019s message under Corbyn resonated both with party supporters and the wider public. By offering its supporters policies they strongly agreed with, Labour also thwarted the electoral threat potentially inherent in its vague position on Brexit. They add that it remains uncertain now however whether avoiding Brexit in favour of other policies will serve Labour as well next time as it did previously. Today\u2019s proceedings are under way in the House of Commons, where the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is taking questions. He\u2019s told MPs that he is one of those who own an electric car and that we\u2019re about to see a big increase in ownership. In the world of business traders are still waiting for Brexit certainty as as Brussels deliberates over the type of extension to give the UK. The Guardian\u2019s business blog quotes Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA The pound has rallied a little this morning on the back of claims that Labour has offered a \u201cpragmatic path\u201d to a Brexit deal with a compromise on the timetable. The details of this are still lacking and the terms will probably not be acceptable to the prime minister but in reality, it\u2019s not that important. An extension will be signed off, at which point we\u2019re probably heading for an election. We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Some have detected a vagueness suddenly returning to Labour\u2019s position after those comments earlier this morning by Rebecca Long-Bailey about the party being prepared to immediately back an election after the EU grants an extension. Steven Swinford of the Times picks up on a slightly different message to Sky News: It\u2019s worth noting too of course that the shadow secretary of state for business, energy &amp; industrial strategy is today also unveiling major Labour plans to create a carbon-neutral energy system by the 2030s including insulation upgrades for every home in the UK and enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. The party is setting out a fast-track climate strategy after adopting plans to work towards a net-zero carbon economy two decades ahead of the government\u2019s legally binding 2050 target. The Liberal Democrats have shared their amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech calling for a new referendum on Brexit. The amendment, signed by the party\u2019s MPs, proposes the addition to the legislation: At end add \u2018but believe that your government should make arrangements for a people\u2019s vote in which the public will have the choice between the latest withdrawal agreement and remaining in the European Union\u2019. The party\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, tweets: One of the more prominent Labour backbenchers this week, Lisa Nandy, has said this morning that five or six days would be a sufficient length of time in committee stage for the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill. Nandy, who was one of the Labour MPs who backed Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill at the its second reading this week with the aim of allowing it to progress to a stage when it can be amended, told the Today programme: When you consider that this is a bill that was published only 72 hours before the House of Commons was meant to consider it, that draws a border down the Irish Sea, so essentially creates an internal border within the United Kingdom, which could spark a chain of events which breaks up the United Kingdom, it seems to me not unreasonable to ask for five or six days to scrutinise it. Nandy added that she had been asked by Conservative ministers how long Labour would need to scrutinise the bill and she said the \u201cgeneral consensus\u201d, including from their chief whip, is that \u201cfive or six days in committee would be sufficient\u201d. An election would still be a major gamble for both Labour and the Tories though and Dan Sabbagh writes in the Guardian on why reluctance on the part of the former goes beyond the need to stave off the potential threat of a no-deal Brexit. The Conservatives already enjoy a healthy poll lead of 10 points, on average, according to Britain Elects, with the government on 35%. That leaves Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opposition on 25%, while the Liberal Democrats sit at 18%. It is a figure so dismal that the party is behind where Michael Foot was in the run-up to the 1983 election, according to the elections expert John Curtice of Strathclyde University \u2013 and would result in a Conservative majority of about 60 on forecasts prepared by Electoral Calculus based on October\u2019s polling. And this is with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party at 12%. Corbyn and other Labour figures have said they want an election once no deal has been \u201ctaken off the table\u201d. Dan adds that against this polling background it would not be surprising, however, if the opposition party found more reasons for delay. The Telegraph also reports on splits in Downing Street, adding that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, Edward Lister, is in favour of accepting a short Brexit delay to get the deal through parliament before going for a mid-December election. That reportedly puts him at odds with Dominic Cummings, who reportedly wants a poll as soon as the EU grants an extension to article 50, with 28 November or December the most like dates. \u201cIs Boris Johnson still listening to Dominic Cummings on Brexit?\u201d the Telegraph also asks. Also speaking of Cummings, the New European has a fairly striking front page today. Many ministers favour an election this year, arguing that Johnson will become progressively weaker if he is forced to fight battles int he commons to pass a Brexit deal, the Financial Times reports. One minister is quoted by the paper as saying: \u201cWe\u2019d cream it, with or without a deal.\u201d On the front of the Guardian, the dividing lines of an emerging Cabinet split are laid out. Some cabinet ministers, including the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, are cautious about asking for an election, report Heather Stewart and Peter Walker They believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading of the Brexit bill on Tuesday suggests Johnson\u2019s deal has enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament. However, hard Brexit supporters appear to be more gung-ho, with leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg fearing support for the bill could yet fall away \u2013 if the 19 Labour rebels who backed it fail to secure the amendments they would like to see, for example. In the mix too - as reported by Buzzfeed - is the prime minister\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, who is said to be one of the main driving forces for an election. Yesterday\u2019s appalling human tragedy in which the bodies of 39 people were found insider a container lorry in Essex dominate the front pages today, but Brexit takes up considerable space inside most titles. The Times makes space on its front for a piece in which it reports that Johnson could make a third attempt to trigger a general election as early as today. He is likely to lay a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act as early as tonight that would force MPs to decide before that much-touted 31 October deadline on whether to permit an election, reports Frances Elliott and Bruno Waterfield. The paper also reports that Theresa May, the former prime minister, has raised concerns about an early election before a Brexit deal is over the line. After Cleverly, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was asked if Labour would vote for a general election as soon as the prime minister asks for one after the EU grants an extension. She said: That\u2019s our position. But we also want the prime minister to look at the compromise that\u2019s been offered that a lot of MPs support, and that\u2019s the ability to be able to properly scrutinise the bill. It\u2019s not quite the election slogan that Downing Street will have been hoping for but the prospect of an election poll appears to be gaining ground, with all the spin-off problems that come with it. As reported by the Guardian earlier this month - and by the Times today - electoral officials are facing logistical issues as authorities seeking to hire venues find that some are already booked up for nativity plays and pre Christmas venues. The Tory party chairman, James Cleverly, when asked about the issue today on the Today programme, replied: I don\u2019t want to be the Grinch but the point is that democracy is incredibly important and we have been prevented from discharging the duty imposed on us. He didn\u2019t take the bait when asked how the party\u2019s Christmas election planning was going. Cleverly had not ruled not Brexit taking place on 31 October and said the government has had to \u201cramp up\u201d its no-deal preparations. The EU has not agreed an extension and therefore it is absolutely essential that we make sure that we are ready to leave. Good morning and welcome to Politics Live for another day of intrigue, brinkmanship and jumbled acronyms as the British government, EU leaders and Labour all face difficult choices over Brexit. I\u2019m Ben Quinn and I will be taking you through all this morning\u2019s developments before handing over to my colleague Frances Perraudin this afternoon. Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet is divided over how to proceed with Brexit, as the prime minister faces the stark choice of pressing ahead with his deal or gambling his premiership on a pre-Christmas general election. After an inconclusive meeting with Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday morning in an attempt to agree an acceptable timetable for parliament to consider the bill, the prime minister told MPs at Wednesday\u2019s PMQs that he was awaiting the decision of the EU27 over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. While the EU\u2019s decision is unlikely to come before Friday, look out for signs of positioning from European capitals and from inside the commission today. The French government has privately voiced its concerns about taking the pressure off MPs to vote for the deal, which they believe could be ratified in 15 days, but EU sources said the bloc was seeking a \u201csolution that works for all\u201d and avoids a no deal exit. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, told Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday his reasons for \u201crecommending the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension\u201d. The Labour party meanwhile also faces a choice, whether to support fresh moves for an election, or to again stand in the way of the two-thirds majority needed as one way of initiating a poll. Timings (provisional) today: \u2022 10.30am - The leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s is expected to make a statement setting out next week\u2019s business. \u2022 5pm - MPs vote on Queen\u2019s speech \u2022 7pm - Jeremy Corbyn to address rally",

      "body": "<p>This was the first meeting between Celtic and Lazio, which did not stop them behaving as if old foes in a gripping encounter.

Celtic\u2019s position at the top of Group E has been strengthened before an eagerly anticipated trip to Rome early next month.</p> <p>Lazio will be frustrated at not taking a point from a match to which they contributed so heavily. The winner came when Christopher Jullien rose to meet an 89th-minute Ryan Christie corner and planted the ball beyond Thomas Strakosha.

      "bodyText": "This was the first meeting between Celtic and Lazio, which did not stop them behaving as if old foes in a gripping encounter. What Celtic lacked in guile they made up for with spirit and it delivered three points. Celtic\u2019s position at the top of Group E has been strengthened before an eagerly anticipated trip to Rome early next month. Lazio will be frustrated at not taking a point from a match to which they contributed so heavily. The winner came when Christopher Jullien rose to meet an 89th-minute Ryan Christie corner and planted the ball beyond Thomas Strakosha. In the madness that followed, there was time for a magnificent Fraser Forster save from a Danilo Cataldi volley. After the dust had settled, the Lazio manager, Simone Inzaghi, dubbed Forster\u2019s actions a \u201cmiracle\u201d. Neil Lennon was equally effusive. \u201cI think Lazio were superb,\u201d the Celtic manager said. \u201cFraser pulled off outstanding saves. It has been an epic night for the players and the club.

Jones has described the All Blacks as the greatest team in sport but has called on his players to \u201cchange history\u201d in the World Cup semi-final on Saturday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/24/rugby-world-cup-semi-final-new-zealand-team\">Hansen says pressure is on England for semi-final after 2015 World Cup flop</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Jones on Thursday confirmed his decision to recall George Ford for England\u2019s first World Cup semi-final for 12 years and reiterated his belief that no one outside the camp believes they are capable of beating New Zealand, who have not lost a match at the tournament since 2007 and are bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive title.</p> \n<p>The All Blacks are also ranked No 1 in the world \u2013 a position they held for 10 consecutive years until Wales and Ireland enjoyed spells at the top shortly before the start of the competition. England, on the other hand, have not occupied top spot for 15 years and have not beaten the All Blacks since 2012. Last year they lost their only match against New Zealand under Jones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/10/england-new-zealand-autumn-international-series-report\" title=\"\">going down by a point</a>.</p> \n<p>Jones, however, believes England can establish themselves as the world\u2019s best. Before the World Cup started he invited Sir Alex Ferguson to address his squad and in echoes of the former Manchester United manager\u2019s claim that usurping rivals Liverpool was his greatest achievement, he said: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been involved in rugby the country you want to knock off is New Zealand, because they\u2019ve been the best. And the reason you\u2019re involved in this game is you want to be the best.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9a9f0c6689a20e8c38405072ab7ec6e55a7fc02\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a9f0c6689a20e8c38405072ab7ec6e55a7fc02/0_159_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Alex Ferguson was invited to speak to the England squad.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Bunn/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the opportunity to change rugby history.

But Jones, who beat the All Blacks five times in 11 matches when in charge of Australia, countered: \u201cWe are ready for the game, we\u2019ve had two-and-a-half years to prepare for this game. [Thirteen] of our players were involved on the [2017] Lions tour. Every game they play at the Six Nations the other country is coming for them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c311b2ac-8e51-4f5f-8bd2-37b3a5b7beb0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dB-bZaXq9D0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis is a big game, let\u2019s not doubt that, but our players have had big-match experience. They\u2019ve failed, they\u2019ve had success and that\u2019s one of the big things I like about this team.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has urged England to knock New Zealand off their perch and replace them as the dominant force in world rugby. Jones has described the All Blacks as the greatest team in sport but has called on his players to \u201cchange history\u201d in the World Cup semi-final on Saturday. Jones on Thursday confirmed his decision to recall George Ford for England\u2019s first World Cup semi-final for 12 years and reiterated his belief that no one outside the camp believes they are capable of beating New Zealand, who have not lost a match at the tournament since 2007 and are bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive title. The All Blacks are also ranked No 1 in the world \u2013 a position they held for 10 consecutive years until Wales and Ireland enjoyed spells at the top shortly before the start of the competition. England, on the other hand, have not occupied top spot for 15 years and have not beaten the All Blacks since 2012. Last year they lost their only match against New Zealand under Jones, going down by a point. Jones, however, believes England can establish themselves as the world\u2019s best. Before the World Cup started he invited Sir Alex Ferguson to address his squad and in echoes of the former Manchester United manager\u2019s claim that usurping rivals Liverpool was his greatest achievement, he said: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been involved in rugby the country you want to knock off is New Zealand, because they\u2019ve been the best. And the reason you\u2019re involved in this game is you want to be the best. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the opportunity to change rugby history. We\u2019re not the best in the world, but we\u2019ve got an opportunity on Saturday to go a step further. I don\u2019t think [rugby] needs it but I think we need it.\u201d After Jones had claimed earlier this week that his side had been spied on in training and that pressure was chasing New Zealand \u201cdown the street\u201d, the All Blacks head coach, Steve Hansen, returned fire by reminding England of their failure to get out of their pool at their own World Cup four years ago. But Jones, who beat the All Blacks five times in 11 matches when in charge of Australia, countered: \u201cWe are ready for the game, we\u2019ve had two-and-a-half years to prepare for this game. [Thirteen] of our players were involved on the [2017] Lions tour. Every game they play at the Six Nations the other country is coming for them. \u201cThis is a big game, let\u2019s not doubt that, but our players have had big-match experience. They\u2019ve failed, they\u2019ve had success and that\u2019s one of the big things I like about this team. We\u2019ve had to learn from those wins, those losses and Saturday it\u2019ll be tested again. We want to write the script, we don\u2019t want to be watching it, we\u2019ve got to be in there writing it.\u201d Jones expects England supporters to be outnumbered at the 72,000\u2011seat Yokohama Stadium, in the main because despite his close links with Japan he believes the locals have adopted the All Blacks as their second team. He urged those in attendance to show their support, however. \u201cWe saw that in the football World Cup and in the cricket World Cup and we are feeling it in the rugby World Cup. \u201cOur supporters have got a big job for us. We need them to be at their most vocal. They need to drink a fair bit of beer beforehand and be ready to go. Most people think New Zealand are going to win, that\u2019s the reality. We\u2019ve got 31 players and 20-odd staff who believe we can win, we\u2019re the only people in Japan who think we can win.\u201d Ford\u2019s recall is the only change made by Jones, with Courtney Lawes keeping his place in the second row. George Kruis had emerged as a candidate to start given his lineout expertise and the fact that was an area England struggled with in the second half of their defeat by New Zealand last year. \u201cThe most crucial stage of this game is going to be the second 20 minutes of the second half, where the game\u2019s going to be won or lost,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe\u2019ve been particularly been more diligent in selecting our team to take that into consideration.

The company forecast that next quarter \u2013 which includes the holiday shopping season \u2013 sales would increase to between $80bn and $86.5bn, 11% or 20% higher than the fourth quarter of 2018. Shares dropped close to 7% in after-hours trading. Amazon spent $800m in the second quarter to expand its free one-day delivery programme as it faces sharper competition from Walmart. World-wide shipping costs increased 46% to $9.6bn from the previous year. The company is also investing heavily in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage as Microsoft and others challenge its business. AWS reported $9bn in sales, slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations of $9.1bn. The latest quarterly results included Prime Day, its shopping event for Amazon Prime members who pay a yearly fee for free shipping and access to its streaming media services. This year\u2019s Prime event was the largest in the company\u2019s history with sales surpassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales combined. During the July sale the company sold over 100,000 laptops and more than a million toys. \u201cWe are ramping up to make our 25th holiday season the best ever for Prime customers \u2013 with millions of products available for free one-day delivery,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 25 october. Top stories The 39 people found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex were Chinese nationals, police have confirmed, as they secured extra time to hold a Northern Irish man on suspicion of murder. The victims, discovered in a refrigerated trailer in Grays on Wednesday, were eight women and 31 men. On Thursday, lorry drivers and officials at Zeebrugge port suggested the victims would have boarded the container \u2013 likely under the supervision of people smugglers \u2013 well away from Zeebrugge\u2019s tight security. \u201cThe grisly discovery of 39 dead Chinese men and women in the back of a lorry in Essex on Wednesday was the culmination of two fateful journeys,\u201d write Jamie Grierson and Molly Blackall, as they retrace the paths taken by the lorry driver and Chinese nationals to Essex. Labor is calling for a police investigation into whether a document was forged in Angus Taylor\u2019s office with the purpose of influencing the exercise of duty by the lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, with Labor declaring it will refer the matter in the next 24 hours. \u201cThe most unfortunate outcome of this affair is that it will once again diminish the already fragile trust in both politicians and journalism. In this era of fake news, the fact that a politician sent a document containing false figures to a journalist, who then relied on it to publish a story, does no one any favours,\u201d writes Anne Davies. Coral coverage around some of the most popular tourist islands on the Great Barrier Reef has dropped by almost half in the last 18 years, according to a new study. Scientists analysed data from monitoring dives between 1999 and 2017 at 100 different locations across the Whitsunday Islands, Magnetic Island, Keppel Islands and Palm Islands. Daniela Ceccarelli, of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said: \u201cThe loss [of hard corals] was between 40 and 50% at each island group. We were pretty shocked actually.\u201d Boris Johnson will ask MPs next week to back a pre-Christmas general election. The prime minister has abandoned his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU by 31 October and written to Jeremy Corbyn saying he will give parliament one last opportunity to scrutinise his withdrawal agreement bill and \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 6 November. But he will also table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act next Monday asking for an early general election. MPs would then vote on the motion the same day. Australia The tribunal tasked with hearing tens of thousands of refugee appeals is struggling under a growing workload despite record clearance rates. A leading Australian climate scientist has said his views have been misrepresented by conservative media commentators, who have used a \u201cmisspoken\u201d statement to dismiss the links between climate change and drought. Parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee has ordered the government back to the drawing board for laws to establish a national facial recognition database, saying the legislation needs to be redrafted to ensure citizens\u2019 rights are protected. The artist Mary Leunig has declared her brother, Michael Leunig, should \u201cspeak to people and listen to people more,\u201d and said he unfairly picks on women and mothers, after the cartoonist was roundly criticised for his latest work. The world A northern California wildfire exploded in size early on Thursday after dangerously dry, windy weather prompted the state\u2019s largest utility to impose electrical blackouts in an effort to prevent fire catastrophes. Sixteen Bangladeshis have been sentenced to death for the murder of a 19-year-old student, Nusrat Jahan Rafi, who was burned to death in April after complaining of being sexually harassed by her school principal. Author JK Rowling has called on students around the world not to volunteer at orphanages, pointing to emerging evidence that \u201corphanage tourism\u201d drives family separation and child trafficking.

He argued that one reason many fear an election is because \u201can early 20th-century class-based structure is struggling to cope with 21st-century demands of identity politics pressed on it by Brexit. \u201cThe party system is based on the idea that broad-church parties can represent coalitions of interest,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when churches become sects, the system breaks down. The danger is now staring us in the face. It is one reason why many people fear the next election.\u201d He argued that events had also shown that British democracy itself needs a reboot. The attempt to prorogue parliament was a \u201cnear-miss event\u201d for our democracy that should serve as a teachable moment, he said. Changes that should follow included the adoption of citizens assemblies, electoral reform, and a written constitution.",

No matter that 13 of the 41 Republicans who protested being banned from the proceedings in fact had access to the room and had actually attended the hearings, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/23/heres-why-matt-gaetz-sit-in-stunt-was-particularly-weird/\">according to</a> the Washington Post.</p> <p>In light of those facts, Republicans\u2019 invasion charade might seem desperate, but it points to an important feature of Trump\u2019s overall impeachment defense, analysts warned, and one that opponents of the president might underestimate.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s playbook when he faced special counsel Robert Mueller was to seek to discredit the investigation as a corrupt, partisan \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d with no grounding in fact. He is pursuing a similar strategy now, with the help of young Republican members in Congress who recognize that the fastest route to building power \u2013 and fame, and perhaps even wealth \u2013 in today\u2019s Washington is to be seen defending the president on TV.</p> <p>Under this strategy, the substance of the impeachment inquiry does not matter; it only matters what the inquiry looks like to the American voters who stand behind the members of Congress in whose hands Trump\u2019s fate lies. Each degree that Trump is able to move the conversation away from his alleged misdeeds and toward supposed flaws in the process or poison in the politics represents a success for him.</p> <p>To that end, Trump in the last week has used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/24/does-donald-trump-really-believe-his-impeachment-inquiry-is-a-lynching\">racially inflammatory language</a> to describe the inquiry, attacked Republicans who oppose him as \u201chuman scum\u201d, and repeatedly demanded that the identity of the whistleblower in the Ukraine affair be revealed.

But Republicans complained that they did not have talking points to follow and it was unclear whom, apart from Trump, they should be taking their cues from.</p> <p>Other planks of Trump\u2019s defensive strategy appear improvised. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/steve-bannon-trump-war-room-radio.html\">Steve Bannon</a>, he of Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign, has announced a daily radio show run from his basement to defend Trump, imagining it as \u201can outside war room\u201d. On the show, Bannon and his co-hosts have counseled Trump and Republicans to throttle back on the conspiracy theories, respect the political chops of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and treat impeachment as a serious threat.</p> <p>And the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a stalwart Trump defender, called a news conference on Thursday to announce that he would introduce a resolution in the Senate condemning the impeachment inquiry.</p> <p>Graham\u2019s rush for the cameras came in seeming response to mounting pressure on him, exerted by the Trump inner circle including Donald Trump Jr, to do more to protect the president, Axios <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/1187365296107147264\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Graham had some advice for Trump this week, as well, telling reporters that it would be good for the White House to assemble a communications team with legal experience to be specially dedicated to impeachment.</p> <p>The White House communications director, Stephanie Grisham, responded to that advice with an attack on Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to message anything that\u2019s going on behind closed doors and in secret,\u201d she was quoted by <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1187355210760544256\">Bloomberg News</a> as saying, ignoring the fact that 48 Republicans, including the vice-president\u2019s brother, sit behind those \u201cclosed doors\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re fighting a ghost.

      "bodyText": "In addition to an abuse-of-power allegation, Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump are said to be building a case against the president for alleged obstruction of justice. But it had not occurred to anyone that the obstruction in question might literally amount to the physical obstruction by Republican lawmakers of impeachment proceedings. The chief justice of the supreme court is supposed to oversee an impeachment trial in the Senate, if it comes to that, but a football referee with a whistle would have been more useful on Wednesday, when a group of 41 Republican members of Congress invaded the secure room where impeachment witnesses are being questioned. The invaders protested that they had been excluded from the proceedings. No matter that dozens of Republicans are sitting in on the hearings, where closed-door status is not remarkable and entirely appropriate, according to Republicans themselves. No matter that 13 of the 41 Republicans who protested being banned from the proceedings in fact had access to the room and had actually attended the hearings, according to the Washington Post. In light of those facts, Republicans\u2019 invasion charade might seem desperate, but it points to an important feature of Trump\u2019s overall impeachment defense, analysts warned, and one that opponents of the president might underestimate. Trump\u2019s playbook when he faced special counsel Robert Mueller was to seek to discredit the investigation as a corrupt, partisan \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d with no grounding in fact. He is pursuing a similar strategy now, with the help of young Republican members in Congress who recognize that the fastest route to building power \u2013 and fame, and perhaps even wealth \u2013 in today\u2019s Washington is to be seen defending the president on TV. Under this strategy, the substance of the impeachment inquiry does not matter; it only matters what the inquiry looks like to the American voters who stand behind the members of Congress in whose hands Trump\u2019s fate lies. Each degree that Trump is able to move the conversation away from his alleged misdeeds and toward supposed flaws in the process or poison in the politics represents a success for him. To that end, Trump in the last week has used racially inflammatory language to describe the inquiry, attacked Republicans who oppose him as \u201chuman scum\u201d, and repeatedly demanded that the identity of the whistleblower in the Ukraine affair be revealed. He has sprinkled some conspiracy dust on top, claiming on Thursday that the impeachment inquiry is part of an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d held by the \u201cdeep state\u201d to circumvent or override his election. And Trump congratulated the \u201ctough, smart and understanding\u201d Republicans who invaded the hearing room, some of whom \u201casked to be arrested\u201d, according to Chad Pergram of Fox News. \u201cThey wanted the optic of being frog marched out of the SCIF [secure room] in front of TV cameras,\u201d Pergram wrote. \u201cThat would help with [the] GOP narrative of Democratic process abuse.\u201d None succeeded in being arrested, although they stayed long enough to order pizza. The Republican demands for \u201ctransparency\u201d in this early stage of the impeachment inquiry has a certain flavor of myopia about it, analysts noted, speculating that public testimony, for example by Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat to Ukraine, could be even more damaging for Trump than was Taylor\u2019s private testimony on Tuesday, which shocked lawmakers. \u201cMark my words,\u201d wrote former FBI special agent and commentator Asha Rangappa, \u201cwhen it comes time, these same people are going to try their damnedest to keep these witnesses from testifying publicly.\u201d As Taylor testified, Trump met with lawyers at the White House \u2013 notably omitting the embattled Rudy Giuliani \u2013 and called congressional Republicans to demand better coordination and a more aggressive impeachment defense, the Wall Street Journal reported. But Republicans complained that they did not have talking points to follow and it was unclear whom, apart from Trump, they should be taking their cues from. Other planks of Trump\u2019s defensive strategy appear improvised. Steve Bannon, he of Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign, has announced a daily radio show run from his basement to defend Trump, imagining it as \u201can outside war room\u201d. On the show, Bannon and his co-hosts have counseled Trump and Republicans to throttle back on the conspiracy theories, respect the political chops of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and treat impeachment as a serious threat. And the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a stalwart Trump defender, called a news conference on Thursday to announce that he would introduce a resolution in the Senate condemning the impeachment inquiry. Graham\u2019s rush for the cameras came in seeming response to mounting pressure on him, exerted by the Trump inner circle including Donald Trump Jr, to do more to protect the president, Axios reported. Graham had some advice for Trump this week, as well, telling reporters that it would be good for the White House to assemble a communications team with legal experience to be specially dedicated to impeachment. The White House communications director, Stephanie Grisham, responded to that advice with an attack on Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to message anything that\u2019s going on behind closed doors and in secret,\u201d she was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying, ignoring the fact that 48 Republicans, including the vice-president\u2019s brother, sit behind those \u201cclosed doors\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re fighting a ghost. You\u2019re fighting against the air. So we\u2019re doing the best we can.\u201d",

Prior to the end of the first world war, general elections were multi-day affairs and four were held wholly or partially in the last month of the year between 1832 and 1918. That latter year saw another in December \u2013 the closest, in fact, to Christmas \u2013 followed by the most recent, on Thursday 6 December 1923. The prime minister on that occasion was the Conservative, Stanley Baldwin. Like Boris Johnson, Baldwin had been in office only a matter of months when he decided to call an election. But, unlike Johnson, he had a comfortable majority in the House of Commons. Baldwin\u2019s decision to go to the polls was for personal as well as political reasons. He had become convinced of the need to introduce tariffs, in order to protect British industry against foreign competition. However, his government had pledged not to introduce tariffs. Baldwin saw it as only proper to ask the country to endorse his change of mind, and as such called a snap general election. But his gamble backfired and, when the country voted, the result was a hung parliament and ultimately a Labour minority government. A general election on 12 December 2019 would mean a dissolution of parliament on 7 November. If MPs fail to trigger an election by that date, however, polling day would almost certainly slip into early next year. A delay of even a few days would push polling day into the week immediately before Christmas; a scenario politicians would probably be keen to avoid. Instead, MPs could hold the trigger-vote in their first week back in the new year, with dissolution potentially on 9 January 2020 and a general election on 13 February, though this could create a further dilemma, as the election campaign might coincide with the UK\u2019s possible exit from the EU on 31 January.",

Barclays said it had been \u201cpersuaded to rethink\u201d its decision, and would now keep the cash withdrawal facility after all. Barclays\u2019 announcement on 8 October that it was pulling out of an agreement allowing its bank customers to withdraw cash from post offices for free led to an immediate outcry.

This all comes against a backdrop of concern that as bank branches and cash machines continue to close, many people, particularly in rural or deprived areas, could find themselves unable to access cash. Barclays has closed at least 481 branches since 2015, according to the consumer body Which?

Remember, the trust started life at 100p in 2015 and, if Woodford had kept pace with his aim of 10% annual improvements in asset value, a par score would be roughly 150p by now. Still, a reset under a new manager looks a healthier outcome than the alternative of putting the fund into run-off. Patient Capital chair Susan Searle\u2019s next act, though, should be her own departure. The board she ran was riddled with conflicts of interest since too many members had close links to Woodford and firms within the portfolio. Well done on hiring Schroders; now it\u2019s time for a new and independent chair. Never a dull day at RBS New chief executive Alison Rose will soon take the reins at Royal Bank of Scotland amid great expectations for share buy-backs and returns of capital. Investors, including the government, might be well-advised not to spend the money before it\u2019s arrived. Another \u00a3900m on PPI provisions was poor, but at least it was expected. Rather, the shock was rotten third-quarter numbers from NatWest Markets, the rump of the old investment banking division. That was enough to ruin an otherwise OK-ish trading performance. Nothing is ever straightforward at RBS.",

They had died of suffocation after the container\u2019s only air vent had been closed to lessen the chance of detection. In 2014, 35 men, women and children were discovered near to death in a container at Tilbury. This week\u2019s deaths come in spite of better detection methods and greater official alertness. Many drivers are more thoroughly trained to conduct regular walk-around checks to detect tampering.

But the job of reviving the eurozone economy is not finished. <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He arrived to recession and ballooning peripheral spreads. He delivered a de facto guarantee to the Eurozone bond markets that dismayed some of his colleagues but which has removed one major structural failing of the single currency system. He revived growth without reviving inflation much, delivering an average of 1.2% real GDP growth and 1.2% CPI inflation over the course of his term. Saving the bond market sent the currency on a tear, which helped drag inflation down, and persuaded him to embark on monetary policies which caused even more friction. His only big mistake however, may have been to prematurely declare victory in 2017 and promise to taper bond purchases. The currency soared, growth slowed and inflation turned back down.<br></p> <p>He leaves with the job of reviving the economy unfinished, and as he hands over the monetary baton to Christine Lagarde she might as well use it to beat up finance ministers and campaign for Europe\u2019s fiscal \u2018rules\u2019 to be thrown into the Rhine. If she can do that, the euro will recover; if she can\u2019t, it is likely to struggle, rising against the dollar only when that falls across the board.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nick Wall </strong>of <strong>Merian Global Investors</strong> agrees that Lagarde will have lots to do:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Draghi\u2019s now famous \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d moment saved the Eurozone by finally allowing the ECB to become a credible lender of last resort, a key facet for any central bank. Sovereign spreads have converged ever since, allowing for the odd political wobble, with Draghi\u2019s ECB loaning money to banks, buying up sovereign and corporate debt, and taking interest rates below zero.</p> <p>The inflation objective during his tenure has not been met, perhaps a near-impossible task given the scale of deleveraging in the Eurozone and challenging demographic trends. But his legacy is the survival of the euro during its toughest test to-date using methods that were previously anathema to a central bank steeped in the traditions of the Bundesbank.</p> <p>The baton now passes to the venerable Christine Lagarde who faces a different set of challenges. An open economy like the Eurozone is highly exposed to the vagaries of global trade and political instability \u2013 the European growth model of high savings is dead in a trade war. Europe can no longer afford for the ECB to remain \u201cthe only game in town\u201d without risking recession, so Lagarde\u2019s task will be to encourage governments to take a more active fiscal policy stance to increase domestic demand. With investors willing to lend to governments, whether its Germany or Greece, at negative interest rates, it should be achievable \u2013 but it will represent a sea change for many European governments, requiring all of Lagarde\u2019s political acumen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Neil MacKinnon</strong> of <strong>VTB Capital</strong> is concerned that the ECB Governing Council is split over the future direction of monetary policy. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The split has cast a cloud over Mario Draghi\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever it takes\u201d can no longer be the ECBs modus operandi under Christine Lagarde. ECB hawks are concerned that a further drift into negative rate territory would hasten \u201cJapanification\u201d while a significant expansion in the ECB\u2019s balance sheet is the road to debt monetisation. In the interim, the German economic slump is dragging the rest of the eurozone into recession and disinflation.</p> <p>It will be less about what monetary policy can do so negative rates will gradually come off the agenda, the emphasis will be more on bank restructuring and recapitalization...balance sheet expansion will become more gradual with more of an emphasis on fiscal expansion.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db190038f08c78d1cb5027b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-24T11:56:24.258Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The European Central Bank has also confirmed that it will restart its stimulus programme on 1 November.</strong></p> <p>As announced last month, it will buy \u20ac20bn of bonds with newly created money each month, until growth and inflation are back on target.<br></p> <p>It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Governing Council expects the purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db18f598f0804be7279b462\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-24T11:50:21.991Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB leaves interest rates on hold</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Mario Draghi has signed off his final meeting as ECB president, by leaving interest rates at all-time lows.</strong></p> <p>That means the benchmark borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks will face negative interest rates of -0.5% for leaving cash at the ECB rather than lending it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fwred/status/1187334222752686082\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Mario Draghi becomes the first president to leave the ECB without ever having raised interest rates.</p>&mdash; Frederik Ducrozet (@fwred) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fwred/status/1187334222752686082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The ECB also warns that rates may not rise for some time:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db18ecd8f0859498cfb3073\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-24T11:47:33.079Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/oct/24/mario-draghi-ecb-eight-years-euro-economics-eurozone-business-live?page=with:block-5db185c48f08993584c8ae35#block-5db185c48f08993584c8ae35\">Today\u2019s disappointing results </a>show that Twitter\u2019s momentum in recent quarters has cooled, says eMarketer Senior Analyst <strong>Jasmine Enberg</strong>:</p> <p>She explains that this could be a bad sign for the current quarter, especially given the problems at its advertising arm:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDespite the continued double-digit growth in monetizable daily active users (mDAUs), Twitter missed on revenue.</p> <p>The miss wasn\u2019t just because of tough comparisons, which were expected to dampen their revenue growth, but issues with their ad product.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s my colleague Philip Inman on today\u2019s ECB meeting: Mario Draghi, the outgoing president of the European Central Bank, has warned that slowing global growth and Brexit uncertainty pose a risk to growth in the eurozone economy amid concerns that Germany remains on the brink of recession. Speaking in Frankfurt after his final ECB policy meeting before stepping down, Draghi said the ECB was concerned that the economy of the 19-member currency bloc, which has slowed this year along with much of the global economy, faced \u201cprotracted weakness\u201d going into 2020. With consumer and business confidence low and trade with the US hit by Donald Trump\u2019s latest raft of import tariffs, risks were all \u201cto the downside\u201d, said the Italian economist, who will be succeeded on 1 November by former International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde. He said: \u201cThe incoming data since the last governing council meeting in early September confirm our previous assessment of a protracted weakness in the euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risk and muted inflation pressure More here: Goodnight!GW The weaker pound helped to push the FTSE 100 up by almost 1% today. The blue-chip index ended 67 points higher at 7,328.25, with exporters and multinationals such as BAE Systems among the risers. The pound has fallen back to $1.281 amid rumours that Boris Johnson may push for a general election again today. That\u2019s a loss of roughly one cent today. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: Not everyone in Germany dislikes Mario Draghi because of his expansive monetary policy. Carsten Brzeski, Germany Chief Economist, says he\u2019s done well: For the time being, Draghi will be the president who brought the ECB to new professional levels, in terms of communication, institutional set-up and toolkit of monetary policy instruments. And the ECB president who saved the eurozone from falling apart, only with words. Arrivederci, Mario. Draghi\u2019s gloomy prognosis shows that his successor, Christine Lagarde, faces a tough task at the ECB. Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International, says she may need to unleash further stimulus measures of her own: With limited room for further manoeuvres, it will be all the ECB can manage to keep the eurozone economy on a stable, albeit very slow, growth path. Indeed, further asset purchases and even more negative interest rates may prove detrimental in the long run. Negative rates, in particular, place a heavy burden on banks\u2019 profitability, challenging their traditional business models, while forcing savers to take additional risks in their search for a positive income stream. \u201cAs highlighted vigorously by Draghi at almost every press conference during his time in office, the ECB needs the support from governments and fiscal policy if things are really to change. However, for this to happen, circumstances may have to get a little worse before they get better, and markets may have to continue to rely on the ECB to provide a backstop for some time to come.\u201d Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, says politicians should heed Draghi\u2019s recommendation to raise spending (where possible): The man that perhaps embodied the superstar central banker more than any other can think about other things now. Investors wait to see which parts of his legacy Christine Lagarde takes forward and whether her much-vaunted political skills can find a way to help the Eurozone out of the current malaise. Meanwhile, investors need to keep an eye on the on-going debate on German fiscal stimulus. Fiscal easing represent a potentially more potent form of support for the economy as monetary policy appears to be reaching its limits.\u201d We heard a familiar message from Mario Draghi today, says Andrew Wilson of Goldman Sachs Asset Management: \u201cAs expected, Mario Draghi used his final meeting as ECB President to reiterate the need for accommodative monetary policies\u2014such as those unveiled in September\u2014to ensure inflation gravitates towards its 2% target. He also continues to advocate for fiscal policy to play a more active role in supporting growth, a message echoed by policymakers during the Autumn IMF/World Bank meetings, with monetary policy increasingly being perceived as insufficient to address growth challenges such as trade protectionism. Here\u2019s some Twitter reaction to Draghi\u2019s last press conference at the ECB - some highly complimentary, some less so.... Mario Draghi has used his final appearance as Europe\u2019s top central banker to warn that the eurozone economy remains weak. Sounding like a man spying clouds on the horizon, he declared: The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside. In particular, these risks pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.\u201d The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in early September confirm our previous assessment of a protracted weakness in the euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risk, and muted inflation pressures.\u201d He also cited Brexit as a key geopolitical risk, even though a hard Brexit currently looks less likely: One has the sense that somehow the lower likelihood of a hard Brexit or a cliff edge has improved the overall situation. On the other, the uncertainty is still there. As he\u2019s done so many times, Draghi warned that the eurozone needs to be strengthened -- with increased government spending where possible, and a stronger \u201cfiscal capability\u201d. Draghi also conducted a staunch defence of his legacy, insisting that the unorthodox monetary policy pushed through on his watch had worked. He cited to the fall in bond yields in Greece as proof, while acknowledging the policies were unpopular in Germany. And while he won\u2019t reveal his next move (the presidency of Italy must come up eventually...), he apparently won\u2019t be joining social media. Shame really. Q: You are credited with saving the euro with three words....but your policies are criticised across the region. One day, a country may decide that the euro is not irreversible .... Should you have done more to reach out to the public? And will Italy ever fix itself? Things have changed completely in Italy in recent years, Draghi replies. Everyone there agrees that the euro is irreversible. [Draghi must be thinking of Matteo Salvini, the right-wing politician who dropped his support for Italy leaving the euro last week] And on the broader point, Draghi says more can and should be done to reach out to the public. However, it\u2019s hard across 19 countries, and it\u2019s tricky to change your language for a different audience. Draghi insists that central bankers can\u2019t get away with opaque language, declaring No-one would ever say \u2018if you understood me, you were stupid\u2019. We all try to be transparent today. [That\u2019s a reference to Alan Greenspan\u2019s notorious comment that \u201cIf I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said\u201d] And that\u2019s it. Draghi\u2019s final press conference is over. Well, he has given us a lot to write about over the years..... Q: When you started, Greece was in a bailout programme. Now, it just sold bonds at a negative yield - so was the Greek programme a success Draghi says that the policies implemented in Greece are paying off. But it also shows the dangers of ending these policies. It\u2019s a good time for Greece, he adds. Q: How can the eurozone be improved? Draghe says it needs a \u201ccentral fiscal capacity\u201d -- perhaps a budget, or some insurance measures , that would kick in when economies hit trouble. He concedes, though, that concerns over \u2018moral hazard\u2019 have prevented it happening (the risk that a country borrows recklessly, and leaves its neighbours with the bill). Asked whether he might become president of Italy, Draghi insists that you\u2019ll have to ask his wife! Obviously he\u2019s just trying to deflect questions about his future. But Serena Draghi comes from a noble family (descended from the Grand Duke of Tuscany), so maybe she really is the power in the marriage. Q: What will you take from your time at the ECB? It was a very intense, profound, fascinating experience, but I won\u2019t say more, Draghi replies. Q: What do you say to those who say you have stopped monetary policy from being boring? One should always attempt to be not boring, Draghi replies (it\u2019s really not something he could be accused of, really). Draghi then turns to political issues. He agrees that there is more political pressure on central bankers, but rather less on the ECB than on other banks. He then reminds politicians that if they want higher interest rates, they need to take fiscal measures -- spending more, rather than relying on monetary policy. Q: Do you think politicians have heard your message about spending and structural reforms? Draghi says the issue is not simple. Countries with fiscal space should act, but those who don\u2019t should create the conditions for \u201cautomatic stabilisers\u2019 to work. Q: What future plans do you have? You\u2019ll have to ask my wife, says Draghi. Q: Any message for your German critics - and are you leaving the pickelhaube (spiked helmet) you were given by a newspaper? Draghi cites the German maxim \u201cGeschenk ist Geschenk\u201d (a gift is a gift), meaning he\u2019ll take the spiky helmet with him. My only message to Germany is that we always tried to deliver on our mandate. Q: But should you have done more to assuage your German critics; should Christine Lagarde learn from this? Draghi manages to forget the question, as he\u2019s got nothing to say on the matter. Here\u2019s an old photo of the pickelhaube: Q: What are you proud of? The way that the governing council and I have focused constantly on our mandate, says Draghi (brushing over the many clashes between policymakers over the years). He declares: My legacy is never give up. Q: Has the eurozone bumble bee graduated into a real bee, as you said it had to back in 2012? Draghi declines to tackle this question, as he was accused of \u2018dubious biology\u2019 when he made this comparison in his famous \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d London speech [It\u2019s the idea that bees are too heavy to fly, but actually get off the ground on a regular basis]. Questions are turning to Mario Draghi\u2019s legacy. Q: How do you feel about not getting monetary policy back to normality, and could politicians have done more to help? I feel like someone who tried to comply with the mandate in the best possible way, Draghi replies. Q: What regrets do you have, and what advice have you given Christine Lagarde before she takes over next month? I can\u2019t answer either question, Draghi replies firmly. He explains that he always focuses on \u201cwhat can be done\u201d, not what happened. You can\u2019t change the past unless you\u2019re a historian, he adds. And on his successor, he says no advice is needed -- she know what needs to be done, and will have a long time on the governing council to do it. Q: Given the rising criticism of central banks from politicians, will they be able to work together in the next financial crisis? Draghi says it is vital that central banks keep co-operating. He adds that forums such as the G20 are more important than ever -- a coded reminder that protectionism and nationalism are undermining such global bodies. Q: Are you worried that Germany will fall into recession, and drag other countries down? Draghi says recent weak economic data have confirmed the ECB was correct to announce a new stimulus programme last month. He cites the slump in manufacturing, saying there are now signs that this has spread to the services sector (as we saw this morning). Draghi says that the risk of a hard Brexit has reduced. The lowered danger of a no-deal crisis has \u201cimproved the overall situation\u201d, he says, although the uncertainty still remains. The \u201cmedium-term situation\u201d is still being considered with concern. Today\u2019s decision was approved \u201cwith unanimity\u201d says Draghi. That suggests the governors who pushed back against last month\u2019s decision didn\u2019t kick up rough today. Q: Did Christine Lagarde express any views at today\u2019s meeting, and does she agree with ECB policy? No, she didn\u2019t take part in the discussions, Draghi replies, but she was in the room. The euro is unusually calm as Draghi speaks -- traders recognising that the ECB president will have left in a week. Mario Draghi is then asked about the split among the governing council at the September meeting, where several governors opposed restarting its bond-buying programme. Draghi insists this isn\u2019t a big problem, trying to sweep the split under the carpet. All central banks have disagreements when monetary policy issues are discussed, he tells the press conference with a smile. This is all part of the ongoing debate and discussions. Onto questions.. Q: Are you concerned about the IMF\u2019s criticism of negative interest rates last week? Draghi hits back, insisting that negative interest rates have had a beneficial impact in the eurozone. The IMF is concerned about the consequences of maintaining negative interest rates for a long time, he says -- the ECB is monitoring these risks. As is traditional, Mario Draghi ends his statement with a plea to eurozone governments to step up their structural reforms. Governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner, Draghi says (that\u2019s you, Germany!) Where public debt is high, governments must implement prudent policies, he adds (Italy, he\u2019s talking to you now). All governments must push a more growth-friendly mix of policies, he adds. It\u2019s a message we\u2019ve heard many, many times before.... Draghi predicts that headline inflation in the eurozone will probably \u201cdecline slightly\u201d before rising by the end of the year. Labour cost pressures have risen, he says (good news for workers!). Risks to the eurozone growth outlook remain to the downside, Draghi warns. He cites \u201cprolonged uncertainties cause by geopolitical factors, protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets\u201d. (That\u2019ll be Brexit, and the US-China trade war). The ECB stands ready to adjust its instruments where necessary to achieve its inflation mandate, says Draghi seriously. He then warns that the eurozone economy appears to be weakening, saying: Incoming data since the meeting in September confirm our previous assessment of a protracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflation pressures. Draghi adds that the new asset-purchase programme should help: Looking suitably demob-happy, Mario Draghi says he\u2019s very happy to update the press on today\u2019s governing council meeting. He\u2019s reading out the statement released 45 minutes ago, confirming that the ECB left interest rates on hold and will begin its new \u20ac20bn/month asset purchase programme next month. He also confirms that Christine Lagarde attended today\u2019s meeting, ready to take over when Draghi leaves on 31 October. Mario Draghi has arrived for his final press conference as ECB president. You can watch it live here. Berenberg Bank have created four charts showing Mario Draghi\u2019s performance. They say he was a \u2018star performer\u2019 at ending the eurozone crisis through his policy measures and verbal commitments.... ..an \u2018outperformer\u2019 on job creation, as his expansive monetary policy encouraged firms to hire staff.... ...but an under-performer when it came to the day job -- maintaining inflation just below 2%, and maintaining he public\u2019s inflation expectations. It\u2019s nearly time for Mario Draghi\u2019s last press conference as head of the European Central Bank, after an eventful eight year stint. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says Draghi certainly did it \u2018his way\u2019. But the job of reviving the eurozone economy is not finished. He arrived to recession and ballooning peripheral spreads. He delivered a de facto guarantee to the Eurozone bond markets that dismayed some of his colleagues but which has removed one major structural failing of the single currency system. He revived growth without reviving inflation much, delivering an average of 1.2% real GDP growth and 1.2% CPI inflation over the course of his term. Saving the bond market sent the currency on a tear, which helped drag inflation down, and persuaded him to embark on monetary policies which caused even more friction. His only big mistake however, may have been to prematurely declare victory in 2017 and promise to taper bond purchases. The currency soared, growth slowed and inflation turned back down. He leaves with the job of reviving the economy unfinished, and as he hands over the monetary baton to Christine Lagarde she might as well use it to beat up finance ministers and campaign for Europe\u2019s fiscal \u2018rules\u2019 to be thrown into the Rhine. If she can do that, the euro will recover; if she can\u2019t, it is likely to struggle, rising against the dollar only when that falls across the board. Nick Wall of Merian Global Investors agrees that Lagarde will have lots to do: Draghi\u2019s now famous \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d moment saved the Eurozone by finally allowing the ECB to become a credible lender of last resort, a key facet for any central bank. Sovereign spreads have converged ever since, allowing for the odd political wobble, with Draghi\u2019s ECB loaning money to banks, buying up sovereign and corporate debt, and taking interest rates below zero. The inflation objective during his tenure has not been met, perhaps a near-impossible task given the scale of deleveraging in the Eurozone and challenging demographic trends. But his legacy is the survival of the euro during its toughest test to-date using methods that were previously anathema to a central bank steeped in the traditions of the Bundesbank. The baton now passes to the venerable Christine Lagarde who faces a different set of challenges. An open economy like the Eurozone is highly exposed to the vagaries of global trade and political instability \u2013 the European growth model of high savings is dead in a trade war. Europe can no longer afford for the ECB to remain \u201cthe only game in town\u201d without risking recession, so Lagarde\u2019s task will be to encourage governments to take a more active fiscal policy stance to increase domestic demand. With investors willing to lend to governments, whether its Germany or Greece, at negative interest rates, it should be achievable \u2013 but it will represent a sea change for many European governments, requiring all of Lagarde\u2019s political acumen. Neil MacKinnon of VTB Capital is concerned that the ECB Governing Council is split over the future direction of monetary policy. The split has cast a cloud over Mario Draghi\u2019s legacy. \u201cWhatever it takes\u201d can no longer be the ECBs modus operandi under Christine Lagarde. ECB hawks are concerned that a further drift into negative rate territory would hasten \u201cJapanification\u201d while a significant expansion in the ECB\u2019s balance sheet is the road to debt monetisation. In the interim, the German economic slump is dragging the rest of the eurozone into recession and disinflation. It will be less about what monetary policy can do so negative rates will gradually come off the agenda, the emphasis will be more on bank restructuring and recapitalization...balance sheet expansion will become more gradual with more of an emphasis on fiscal expansion.\u201d The European Central Bank has also confirmed that it will restart its stimulus programme on 1 November. As announced last month, it will buy \u20ac20bn of bonds with newly created money each month, until growth and inflation are back on target. It says: The Governing Council expects the purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. Newsflash: Mario Draghi has signed off his final meeting as ECB president, by leaving interest rates at all-time lows. That means the benchmark borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks will face negative interest rates of -0.5% for leaving cash at the ECB rather than lending it. The ECB also warns that rates may not rise for some time: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Today\u2019s disappointing results show that Twitter\u2019s momentum in recent quarters has cooled, says eMarketer Senior Analyst Jasmine Enberg: She explains that this could be a bad sign for the current quarter, especially given the problems at its advertising arm: \u201cDespite the continued double-digit growth in monetizable daily active users (mDAUs), Twitter missed on revenue. The miss wasn\u2019t just because of tough comparisons, which were expected to dampen their revenue growth, but issues with their ad product. That could impact their performance in the all-important Q4.\u201d Central bank news: Turkey has just cut interest rates by a chunky 250 basis points. This takes Turkish benchmark borrowing costs down to 14%, from 16.5% previously. That\u2019s a much bigger cut to the one-week repo rate than expected. It follows signs that Turkish inflation is being tamed, as the damage caused by last year\u2019s currency crisis fades, and the lifting of US sanctions. Newsflash: Social network Twitter has missed revenue and earnings forecasts, sending its stock sliding in pre-market trading. Twitter has reported that its revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $824 million, missing Wall Street expectations of $874 million. Net income also shrank too, coming in at $37 compared with adjusted net income of $106m a year ago. Twitter has blamed \u201crevenue product issues\u201d -- technical problems that messed up its advertising services. It also pointed to \u201cgreater-than-expected seasonality\u201d -- apparently there were fewer big events to tweet about than last summer.... Twitter grew its base of \u201caverage monetizable daily active usage\u201d was 145 million, compared to 124 million a year ago. The challenge, though, seems to be actually monetizing them! In a blow to investors, Twitter has also trimmed its revenue forecasts in the light of recent problems. That\u2019s disappointed Wall Street, sending shares down 12% in pre-market. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s CEO, says the company is doing a good job cleaning up its service from trolls and other malign forces: \u201cWe also continue to make progress on health, improving our ability to proactively identify and remove abusive content, with more than 50% of the Tweets removed for abusive content in Q3 taken down without a bystander or first person report.\u201d Germany\u2019s jobs market has been the envy of the eurozone for years. But that may be changing. Today\u2019s PMI reports show that firms cut staff for the first time since 2013, as they reeled from a sharp drop in new orders. Factory staffing levels fell at the sharpest rate in a decade, as firms ditched temporary and contract workers. Cathal Kennedy and Megum Muhic of Royal Bank of Canada are concerned by the lack of improvement in today\u2019s PMI survey. They told clients: The drop in employment was consistent with signs of easing capacity pressures with firms reducing backlogs of work at the quickest pace in 7 years. Meanwhile business sentiment fell to the lowest since November 2012. The combination of contracting new orders, easing capacity pressures and increased pessimism on future expectations points to further job losses in the months ahead. We have been highlighting for some time the risks of the labour market turning, especially in Germany, and the latest PMIs show this risk taking hold Here\u2019s our news story on this morning\u2019s poor PMI data: New groundbreaking analysis released today has shown how corrupt super-wealthy people are funnelling dirty cash into the UK. Transparency International UK has analysed more than 400 money laundering and corruption cases. It uncovers how ultra-expensive homes, expensive cars and jets, luxury goods, and private school fees are being paid for with ill-gotten gains. Nearly 600 UK businesses and organisations have received suspect funds, from schools and universities to architects and interior design firms -- either knowingly or unknowingly. Daniel Bruce, their CEO, says \u201ca range of rogues including former presidents, prime ministers and senior public officials who have been caught with their fingers in the till\u201d are taking advantage of the UK establishment. My colleague Rupert Neate has read the report, and explains: Research by Transparency International, an anti-corruption campaign group, found more than \u00a3300bn of suspect funds have been funnelled through the UK banks, law firms and accountants before being spent on a \u00a31m Cartier diamond ring, masterpiece art works from Sotheby\u2019s, and a \u00a350,000 Tom Ford crocodile-skin jacket with matching crocodile-skin handbag from Harrods. The suspect cash \u2013 which often comes from corrupt officials\u2019 embezzlement of hundreds of millions of pounds from poor countries\u2019 state coffers \u2013 was also found to have been spent on a \u00a3200,000 Bentley Bentayga driven by the 22-year-old son of the former prime minister of Moldova. His father, Vlad Filat, had been sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in the \u201ctheft of the century\u201d. Here\u2019s his story: Here\u2019s the full report: AT YOUR SERVICE Anders Svendsen of Nordea Markets fears that the eurozone economy is at risk of recession: The decline in Germany\u2019s private sector has alarmed economists, who fear that Europe\u2019s largest economy is weakening. Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl of Allianz fears that Germany will be at risk of recession in 2020 (it may have already entered one this summer). Here\u2019s her take on Germany\u2019s composite PMI coming in at just 48.6, showing a contraction: The subdued outlook for global trade and the car industry as well as lingering elevated political uncertainty surrounding trade and Brexit are still weighing too heavily on Germany\u2019s industry. The renewed decline in new export orders suggests that external headwinds will continue to persist in the coming months. In addition, there are increasing signs that the pronounced industrial weakness is spreading to other sectors of the German economy. Macroeonomist Hadrien Camatte fears that the problems in Germany\u2019s factory sector have now spread to the broader economy: Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says Germany is being overhauled by France, where growth is strengthening. The weak October PMI report shows the ECB may need to take more action, argues City brokerage XM: Flash PMI readings for October released this morning showed the region\u2019s economic troubles were far from over as they disappointed once again. The key composite PMI by IHS Markit rose slightly in October but by less than expected, suggesting the Eurozone may require still more stimulus. Some instant reaction to the eurozone PMI survey: Today\u2019s weak PMI surveys suggest the eurozone economy only grew by 0.1% in July-September, says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. That would be even weaker than the 0.2% growth recorded in April-June- well below long-term trends. Williamson explains that Brexit worries, the US-China trade war, and the global slowdown are all hurting eurozone companies: \u201cThe eurozone economy started the fourth quarter mired close to stagnation, with the flash PMI pointing to a quarterly GDP growth rate of just under 0.1%. \u201cThe manufacturing downturn remains the fiercest since 2012, and continues to infect the service sector, where October saw the smallest increase in new work for almost five years. \u201cThe labour market is meanwhile being hit as firms retrench amid signs of excess capacity and uncertainty about the year ahead intensifies. Optimism about future prospects deteriorated further in October to the lowest for over six years, commonly linked to global trade tensions, Brexit- related worries and increasingly gloomy economic forecasts. \u201cA further deterioration in jobs growth adds to the risk that the trade-led weakening is spreading further to the household sector, which could dampen growth further as we head towards the end of the year. \u201cThe survey indicates that Mario Draghi\u2019s tenure at the helm of the ECB ends on a note of near-stalled GDP, slower jobs growth, near-stagnant prices and growing pessimism about the outlook, piling pressure on Christine Lagarde to drive new solutions to the eurozone\u2019s renewed malaise.\u201d Newsflash: The Eurozone economy is close to stagnation, casting a shadow over Mario Draghi\u2019s final performance as ECB president today. Demand for goods and services is falling this month, for the second successive month, according to the latest flash PMI data for the region. The euro area service sector managed some growth, but manufacturing output suffered another decline. This is partly due to the slump in Germany (which we covered earlier). France is doing better, but the rest of the region stalled, says data firm IHS Markit. It explains: The Eurozone economy remained close to stagnation at the start of the fourth quarter, according to the latest flash PMI data, with demand for goods and services falling for a second successive month. This has left Markit\u2019s flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index at 50.2 -- barely above the cut-off point between growth and contraction. It was 50.1 in September. The eurozone services PMI rose to 51.8, from 51.6, which is one of the weakest expansions seen since 2014. The manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 45.7, showing a steep decline in output. In further gloom, companies\u2019 future expectations sank to the gloomiest since 2013 and jobs growth hit the lowest since 2014. More to follow.... Bloomberg have produced this excellent thread showing Mario Draghi\u2019s legacy - where he did well (holding the euro together) and where he fell short: In the City, shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen almost 3% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. The bank has taken another hit on PPI compensation this morning, setting aside another \u00a3900m for customers missold payment protection insurance. This dragged RBS into an operating loss of \u00a38m for the third quarter of this year. NatWest Markets, its investment banking arm, struggled with core income shrinking by 44%. It blamed \u201ca deterioration in economic sentiment for the global economy and a fall in bond yields.\u201d Boom! Germany\u2019s stock index has hit its highest level since June 2018, as markets rally across Europe. The Stoxx 50 index of Europe\u2019s largest companies has reached its highest level since January 2018. Traders are still waiting for a Brexit breakthrough, says Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA. Brexit limbo continues on Thursday as the UK awaits judgement from Brussels on its extension request, one week before the country is due to leave the European Union. The EU will be in no rush to make a decision and may even be awaiting more details on how Parliament intends to make use of the time before doing so. There\u2019s little chance of it rejecting the request but how long it offers needs to be determined. The pound has rallied a little this morning on the back of claims that Labour has offered a \u201cpragmatic path\u201d to a Brexit deal with a compromise on the timetable. The details of this are still lacking and the terms will probably not be acceptable to the Prime Minister but in reality, it\u2019s not that important. An extension will be signed off, at which point we\u2019re probably heading for an election. We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Bad news! Germany\u2019s private sector companies are slashing jobs as output and activity continues to shrink. Data firm Markit\u2019s healthcheck shows that employment at German firms is falling for the first time in six years this month. Growth across the service sector slowed, while factories are suffering another contraction: Here\u2019s the details (any reading below 50 shows contraction) Flash Germany PMI Composite Output Index: 48.6 (Sep: 48.5). 2-month high. Flash Germany Services PMI Activity Index: 51.2 (Sep: 51.4). 37-month low. Flash Germany Manufacturing PMI: 41.9 (Sep: 41.7). 2-month high. Flash Germany Manufacturing Output Index:t 43.6 (Sep: 43.0). 2-month high Such weak figures will fuel concerns that Germany is in recession, given the PMIs often correlate closely with GDP. Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cHopes of a return to growth in Germany in the final quarter have been somewhat dashed by the October flash PMI numbers, which show business activity in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy contracting further and underlying demand continuing to soften. \u201cManufacturing remains the main weak link, though here there are some signs of encouragement with rates of decline in production and new orders easing and business confidence improving to a four-month high. Some good news: France\u2019s economy has strengthened this month, according to data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 survey of purchasing managers shows that service sector firms are growing solidly, while manufacturing managed some growth too. Here\u2019s the details (any reading over 50 shows growth).

The euro-ara jobless rate is now 7.4% - still too high, but much better than the 12% seen in 2013. That decline came as the ECB expanded its balance sheet, slashed borrowing costs and encouraged banks to lend to the real economy (through Draghi\u2019s TLTRO programme of cheap loans]. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: It will not be a far fetched statement to say that Mario Draghi, the current president of the European Central Bank (ECB), saved the Euro. He saved the single currency of the eurozone by introducing three keywords: \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d. Another significant accomplishment is employment growth in the euro-zone, 11 million jobs. He can certainly be proud of his achievements at the central bank. However, the area of the eurozone which didn\u2019t perform well under his tenure is inflation. It has been languishing, and unfortunately, the situation isn\u2019t getting any better despite his last-ditch back in September to boost price stability\u2014inflation. I fear that today\u2019s ECB press conference will fail to match April 2015. That was the unforgettable moment when activist Josephine Witt sprang onto Draghi\u2019s desk, decorated him with confetti and called for an end \u201cECB Dick-tatorship\u201d, before being hauled off by security guards. After being released from the police station, Witt told us why she did it: \u201cWhat I wanted to demonstrate is that economics are not just some god-given thing that we have to accept and go along with. We can try to change our economy. If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The man who saved the euro is leaving the building. After eight years as president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi is chairing his final governing council meeting today - before handing over to Christine Lagarde at the end of the month. And what an eight years it\u2019s been. Draghi arrived just as the eurozone crisis was fully aflame. Greece, Ireland and Portugal had already lost the confidence of the markets and been bailed out, and Spain and Italy were feeling the heat too. He immediately slashed interest rates (reversing a frankly baffling hike by his predecessor), and went on to unleash his famous bazooka -- buying up government bonds to keep eurozone yields away from the danger zone. Indeed, Draghi\u2019s pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d in July 2012 went a huge way towards shoring up support for the euro, at a time when Grexit fears were haunting the markets. And when the eurozone economy stumbled in 2015, Draghi hit back with a massive bond-buying quantitative easing scheme -- defying doubters who claimed a huge money-printing spree would violate the Bank\u2019s mandate. Few central bankers have had such a dramatic tenure, and even fewer can say they rescued a currency. But Draghi isn\u2019t without critics. The ECB clashed with Greece\u2019s anti-austerity Syriza party through the wild days of 2015, after refusing to support its debt swap plan. It eventually froze the emergency funding keeping Greek banks afloat, triggering the imposition of capital controls. Germans aren\u2019t happy with Draghi either, after seeing savings rates shrivel thanks to the ECB\u2019s current policy of negative interest rates. One newspaper even compared him to Dracula, for sucking their savings away. Mario Draghi usually bats such criticism aside, pointing out that savers wouldn\u2019t be happy if banks failed or we plunged into a depression. But the real problem, as Draghi clears out his locker, is that the eurozone economy still looks weak, with lacklustre growth and inflation still below target. Only last month the ECB outlined a new stimulus plan - another attempt to spur activity. But several governing council members pushed back against the plan, suggesting Lagarde won\u2019t have an easy task either. That will be reinforced by PMI surveys due this morning, which will show that private sector companies are struggling, with manufacturing continuing to shrink. The euro may be intact, but the eurozone is struggling.

      "bodyText": "Right-wing populists are expected to make strong gains in the German state of Thuringia on Sunday, in further proof of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\u2019s growing strength. However, outrage sparked by Nazi slogans, death threats and the recent deadly attack on a synagogue may have dampened expectations of the party seizing control from the embattled left. In what has been billed as a fight for the political heart of Germany, the anti-immigration, anti-establishment AfD, which made strong gains in the states of Saxony and Brandenburg last month, was expected to take around 23%, according to final polling, more than double its previous result of 10.6% in the east-central state. It is vying for second place with the Christian Democrats (CDU) of Angela Merkel, which was on on 22.9% in final polls. Die Linke, which under its popular leader, Bodo Ramelow, has led Thuringia in a coalition with the Social Democrats and the Greens since 2014, is widely expected to win with around 30%, but is likely to struggle to form a majority government. The AfD framed its campaign from the start as a cultural clash with the established parties. It has accused those in power of failing to deliver on the promises made since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago to citizens of the former communist east, including 2 million Thuringians. \u201cWe have been left behind,\u201d said Astrid, a care worker from M\u00fchlhausen, using a phrase that has come to define supporters of the AfD in recent elections: \u201cabgeh\u00e4ngt\u201d, literally \u201chung up\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d. The 59-year-old, who did not want to give her surname, said she had voted for Die Linke at the last poll but was now considering supporting the AfD. Johannes Br\u00fcns, the mayor of M\u00fchlhausen, said the city of 36,000 had much to be proud of: Johann Sebastian Bach was once the resident organist, it boasts one of Germany\u2019s largest medieval centres and is the birthplace of John A Roebling, the civil engineer behind New York\u2019s Brooklyn Bridge. \u201cIt has a lot going for it,\u201d Br\u00fcns said. \u201cBut the people here have had a tough time having to reorientate themselves. Nineteen out of 20 eastern Germans had to find new jobs after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Some left and succeeded, some stayed and succeeded, but some got left behind and the insecurities have remained. There is a considerable amount of frustration.\u201d The town prospered over centuries thanks to its expansive textile industry. But much of that was closed by the Treuhand, the agency tasked with restructuring and selling state-owned businesses in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) before unification in October 1990. Often that involved buying up the competition, making use of the know-how before liquidating the companies. \u201cResentment about that sits deep to this day,\u201d Br\u00fcns said. Resentment which, he added, was only reinforced by issues such as pensions being lower than those in the west and more recently, the refugee crisis. \u201cThe most frequent comment I hear from the 50-plus is: \u2018There\u2019s little recognition for what we\u2019ve achieved in our lives, but the government doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to helping refugees.\u2019\u201d The AfD\u2019s success \u2013 polls repeatedly show it has the support of around a quarter of voters in Thuringia \u2013 was the direct consequence of such neglect, he believed. Torben Braga, an AfD candidate, made no bones about the fact his party was busy tapping into that emotion with its election slogan, \u201cVollende die Wende\u201d (Complete the transition), a reference to the switch from communism to liberal democracy, which is widely interpreted as an invitation by the party to overturn the status quo, just as protesters who brought down the East German regime did. \u201cThis is an election and elections are all about speaking to people\u2019s emotions,\u201d said Braga. \u201cThirty years after the peaceful revolution of 1989, there are still serious differences between east and west, including the level of wages, the infrastructure, and employment figures. There are still no Dax-registered companies from eastern Germany; there is huge emigration from east to west. This bothers people a great deal and the AfD has managed to effectively instrumentalise these emotions for its own gain.\u201d Steffen Thormann, 25, a political science student and a candidate for Die Linke in his native M\u00fchlhausen, said he had grown up surrounded by people harbouring such frustrations. \u201cThe Berlin Wall still exists in many people\u2019s heads, even those of my age who weren\u2019t born when it fell,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people are disappointed that, for them, life didn\u2019t improve after reunification in the way they had hoped. The AfD has been very successful at fuelling the envy, but Die Linke has constantly tried to win people\u2019s trust with its solid social policy, including putting more money into schools and kindergartens.\u201d Astrid, who was walking her dog on the main square waiting for an AfD election rally to start, said she had been \u201can excited 29-year-old\u201d when the wall came down. \u201cWhen the factory I worked in was closed down, I retrained as a care worker,\u201d she said. \u201cI got to know west Germans, I was open to everything.\u201d Now, she said, she struggled to pay her rent, and worried how she would make ends meet on her pension. The arrival of hundreds of refugees in M\u00fchlhausen in 2015 had felt like a further threat to her existence, she said. \u201cThose in power cut the numbers of police and said they didn\u2019t have the funds to fix the holes in the road, but suddenly money was found to house the newcomers.\u201d Astrid was waiting to hear Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the AfD\u2019s leading candidate and head of its extremist wing who many say is radicalising the party. H\u00f6cke condemned an attack earlier this month on a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle carried out by a lone gunman, but was accused of helping stoke the hatred with his anti-Jewish rhetoric. He has called for a \u201c180-degree shift\u201d in Germany\u2019s remembrance culture of its Nazi past and has labelled the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d. When a state broadcaster suggested to him recently it was hard to decipher between some of his statements and those of Adolf Hitler, H\u00f6cke angrily walked out and said he was being portrayed as \u201cthe nation\u2019s devil\u201d. Mike M\u00f6hring, the CDU\u2019s main candidate who has received death threats from neo-Nazis during the campaign, has called H\u00f6cke \u201ca Nazi\u201d and his and the other parties have refused to enter a coalition with the AfD. The result in Sunday\u2019s election is unlikely to cause any major upsets in Berlin, but it is being watched closely, not least as a gauge of the AfD\u2019s standing. \u201cI am undecided,\u201d said Astrid. \u201cI am angry, but I have no desire to be associated with Nazis.\u201d",

      "body": "<p> The UK\u2019s largest payday lender is at risk of entering administration, a year after its rival Wonga collapsed due to a surge in complaints.</p> <p>The US owner of CashEuroNet UK, which operates the QuickQuid and On Stride brands, is considering its options after confirming plans to exit its British operations.</p> <p>It came after Chicago-based Enova failed to reach an agreement with UK regulators to reduce the number of customers it would have to compensate over historical loans.</p> <p>Payday lenders are under strain because of a rise in compensation claims lodged by customers who believe they were mis-sold loans they could not afford. Similar issues triggered the collapse of the former industry leader Wonga in 2018 and The Money Shop in June.</p> <p>Grant Thornton is poised to handle CashEuroNet UK\u2019s wind-down if Enova decides to place the division into administration. </p> <p>Enova\u2019s chief executive, David Fisher, blamed the financial ombudsman, which settles disputes between lenders and customers, for moving the goalposts on its complaints process.</p> <p>\u201cOver the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015. FOS, the financial ombudsman, has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de-facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines,\u201d Fisher said.</p> <p>Fisher said the FCA and financial ombudsman failed to provide clarity on \u201cthe future state of complaints handling,\u201d adding: \u201cDespite our best efforts to come to a resolution, we were unable to find a path forward that provides us the clarity we need to continue investing in our UK business.</p> <p>CashEuroNet UK accounts for up to 25% of the UK payday loans market, according to one industry insider. While CashEuroNet UK\u2019s total customer numbers are not disclosed, its QuickQuid website claims to have served \u201c1.4 million customers and counting\u201d.</p> <p> The payday sector has suffered amid political and regulatory pressure over its business model, which charges high interest rates for loans.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s largest payday lender is at risk of entering administration, a year after its rival Wonga collapsed due to a surge in complaints. The US owner of CashEuroNet UK, which operates the QuickQuid and On Stride brands, is considering its options after confirming plans to exit its British operations. It came after Chicago-based Enova failed to reach an agreement with UK regulators to reduce the number of customers it would have to compensate over historical loans. Payday lenders are under strain because of a rise in compensation claims lodged by customers who believe they were mis-sold loans they could not afford. Similar issues triggered the collapse of the former industry leader Wonga in 2018 and The Money Shop in June. Grant Thornton is poised to handle CashEuroNet UK\u2019s wind-down if Enova decides to place the division into administration. Enova\u2019s chief executive, David Fisher, blamed the financial ombudsman, which settles disputes between lenders and customers, for moving the goalposts on its complaints process. \u201cOver the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015. FOS, the financial ombudsman, has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de-facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines,\u201d Fisher said. Fisher said the FCA and financial ombudsman failed to provide clarity on \u201cthe future state of complaints handling,\u201d adding: \u201cDespite our best efforts to come to a resolution, we were unable to find a path forward that provides us the clarity we need to continue investing in our UK business. CashEuroNet UK accounts for up to 25% of the UK payday loans market, according to one industry insider. While CashEuroNet UK\u2019s total customer numbers are not disclosed, its QuickQuid website claims to have served \u201c1.4 million customers and counting\u201d. The payday sector has suffered amid political and regulatory pressure over its business model, which charges high interest rates for loans. A QuickQuid customer taking out a \u00a3250 loan for three and a half months would be charged interest rates equal to an annual percentage rate (APR) of 1,300%, according to an example on the lender\u2019s website. The company\u2019s troubles, first reported by Sky News, places further pressure on the payday loans sector, which is still recovering from Wonga\u2019s collapse. Wonga was pushed into administration after a spike in complaints over excessive charges on historical loans, that in some cases came with interest rates equal to an APR topping 5,000%. A similar surge in complaints contributed to the collapse of the pawnbroker and payday lender The Money Shop, owned by Instant Cash Loans. Payday lenders in the UK have struggled following new regulations introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2014. It resulted in a cap on payday loans charges, which kept lenders from charging more in fees and interest than the amount borrowed, and also enforced affordability checks. Those changes not only restricted lenders\u2019 income, but resulted in a flurry of complaints by customers who said they could not afford the loans they were sold. The complaints were lodged with the Financial Ombudsman Service, which settles disputes between lenders and customers. Sara Williams, a debt campaigner and author of the Debt Camel blog, said: \u201cWonga and the Instant Cash Loans group have already been brought down by the cost of paying payday loan refunds, now CashEuroNet looks set to go under as well. \u201cCashEuroNet has previously blamed the Financial Ombudsman for an overzealous approach to payday loan affordability complaints. But the regulator\u2019s rules about affordability have remained broadly the same for more than 10 years.\u201d. A loan is only deemed affordable if a customer can repay it without getting into hardship, falling behind on bills or having to borrow again, she explained. \u201cBut too many CashEuroNet customers were left so short of money when they repaid a loan that they were forced to keep borrowing for months or even years. When the Financial Ombudsman says a customer was given unaffordable loans, the lender has to refund the interest they charged. So many QuickQuid customers are being refunded thousands of pounds,\u201d said Williams. Enova, the US-based parent of CashEuroNet UK, said last year that a rise in company complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service could have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on its UK operations. It accused the ombudsman of taking a \u201cvery consumer-friendly approach to its complaint-handling process and dispute resolutions.\u201d In July this year, the company said a 19% rise in its operating and technology costs across the business was partly because of \u201congoing expenses associated with customer complaints in the United Kingdom.\u201d It also revealed that revenues across its UK operations suffered a 20% drop over the first half of 2019 to \u00a355m.",

It brought to an end an anomaly that had persisted for 44 years \u2013 because in principle, a democracy cannot honour a dictatorship. Until now, Franco had been interred in a mausoleum of gigantic proportions, located in the mountains to the north of Madrid, at an altitude of 1,400 metres and crowned by a 150-metre-high cross that can be seen for miles.</p> <p>From now on, his remains will lie in the family tomb of an ordinary cemetery, with no flag or honours of any kind. The dictator has left the monument that was constructed on his orders at the end of the civil war, under the initial direction of the Basque architect Pedro Muguruza, a sympathiser with the new regime. It is estimated that the monument\u2019s construction was achieved with the labour of 20,000 Republican prisoners of war and political prisoners, a fact that has been especially hurtful to many.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our democracy has matured and strengthened, but the mausoleum remained in plain sight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dictator\u2019s family and the monks of the basilica <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/spain-valley-of-the-fallen-general-franco-exhumations\" title=\"\">had attempted to prevent the exhumation</a>, using all the instruments legally available to them. It is the very strength of the Spanish legal system that has given them the protection that the dictator refused to the millions of Spaniards whom he made his enemies, and to those he executed without mercy. Nevertheless, these legal manoeuvres only delayed the outcome. The fact that the exhumation is taking place today, and not sooner, is due to those who opposed it, not because of government inaction.</p> <p>The first step towards this conclusion was taken in May 2017, when a parliamentary initiative by the Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/spain-to-establish-truth-commission-for-franco-era-crimes\" title=\"\">reactivate</a> the 2007 law of historical memory and to exhume the dictator generated an extraordinary degree of consensus in the congress of deputies. Only one vote was cast against the measure, and that was by mistake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82551bd8ae368d0421dc6cc27bbc96e466f129cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82551bd8ae368d0421dc6cc27bbc96e466f129cb/0_155_4986_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Family members carry Franco\u2019s coffin out of the basilica of the Valley of the Fallen mausoleum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family members carry Franco\u2019s coffin out of the basilica of the Valley of the Fallen mausoleum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the basis of the consensus \u2013 inevitably nuanced but fundamentally solid \u2013 that a democracy cannot honour a dictatorship, the government led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez put into action the exhumation procedure.

      "bodyText": "In Spain, the process to exhume the remains of the dictator Francisco Franco from the basilica at the site known as the Valley of the Fallen concluded today. It brought to an end an anomaly that had persisted for 44 years \u2013 because in principle, a democracy cannot honour a dictatorship. Until now, Franco had been interred in a mausoleum of gigantic proportions, located in the mountains to the north of Madrid, at an altitude of 1,400 metres and crowned by a 150-metre-high cross that can be seen for miles. From now on, his remains will lie in the family tomb of an ordinary cemetery, with no flag or honours of any kind. The dictator has left the monument that was constructed on his orders at the end of the civil war, under the initial direction of the Basque architect Pedro Muguruza, a sympathiser with the new regime. It is estimated that the monument\u2019s construction was achieved with the labour of 20,000 Republican prisoners of war and political prisoners, a fact that has been especially hurtful to many. The dictator\u2019s family and the monks of the basilica had attempted to prevent the exhumation, using all the instruments legally available to them. It is the very strength of the Spanish legal system that has given them the protection that the dictator refused to the millions of Spaniards whom he made his enemies, and to those he executed without mercy. Nevertheless, these legal manoeuvres only delayed the outcome. The fact that the exhumation is taking place today, and not sooner, is due to those who opposed it, not because of government inaction. The first step towards this conclusion was taken in May 2017, when a parliamentary initiative by the Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) to reactivate the 2007 law of historical memory and to exhume the dictator generated an extraordinary degree of consensus in the congress of deputies. Only one vote was cast against the measure, and that was by mistake. On the basis of the consensus \u2013 inevitably nuanced but fundamentally solid \u2013 that a democracy cannot honour a dictatorship, the government led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez put into action the exhumation procedure. The supreme court endorsed the action, and therefore all legal guarantees were obtained. The fact that Franco\u2019s descendants have declared their intention to appeal to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg is just another example of democratic generosity, albeit ironic. The Franco family are joined in their displeasure by the recently elected parliamentary deputies of the far right (less numerous in Spain than other European countries), but this does not mean that the issue is divisive within Spanish society.

After three years of dithering since the 2016 referendum, this last gasp of Britain\u2019s liberal establishment, once so confident and unassailable, has become a drawn-out howl of anguish. Ever since one of its former members, Boris Johnson, turned Caliban, he has roamed the political landscape, taunting his old associates at every turn. He threatens them with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/boris-johnson-asks-tory-conference-are-we-ready-for-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">no-deal Brexits</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/soft-brexit-tories-might-back-deal-if-wto-loophole-closed\" title=\"\">general elections</a>, and they shudder. He may be the weakest prime minister in recent history. But remainers have no idea how to respond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/17/boris-johnson-deal-mps-dup-brexit-britain\">Boris Johnson has a deal. Now MPs must end the agony and vote it through | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister now faces almost certain defeat over his rock-solid pledge, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-pledges-to-leave-the-eu-on-october-31-no-ifs-no-buts/\" title=\"\">no ifs, no buts</a>\u201d, to leave the EU by 31 October. Assuming Brussels allows him to postpone Brexit to give him time to pass his withdrawal bill through parliament, he has two options. He can press ahead with that bill and risk delays and hostile amendments, or he can \u201cpause\u201d it and attempt instead to get a pre-Christmas general election, which should give him more room for manoeuvre. For that, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he needs Labour cooperation.</p> <p>In a bold bid to square the circle, Johnson has offered more time in parliament in return for Labour\u2019s agreement to an election date of 12 December. Labour must decide if it wants to be tied down in that way. In particular, will Johnson accept amendments to his bill over the next month that he might not like. He has one asset in hand: that the House of Commons has already voted on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/mps-reject-boris-johnsons-attempt-to-fast-track-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">second reading</a> to pass his Brexit bill. He therefore needs only to survive the amendments stage. But his opponents would surely be wise to await the outcome of their amendments before agreeing to go to the country.</p> <p>Johnson should have every incentive to be extremely collaborative on such amendments. They might not suit some of his wilder backbenchers but they would get him from his present bind to where he wants to be, on the sunny uplands of an election campaign, where he is sure he can win a signal victory. Every tactical consideration should impel him towards a compromise on the bill \u2013 even if it might embrace a confirmatory referendum down the line. Just get it out of the way.</p> <p>Labour would be well advised to collaborate. Jeremy Corbyn and his disjointed band of remainers, half-leavers, soft-Brexiters and second-coming referendum-ers, have been wrongfooted at every turn. They should now concentrate on one thing, minimising the cost of Brexit to the economy. Their task should be to soften its impact. Now to stand in its way would see them massacred at the polls.</p> <p>Those eager to keep Britain as close as possible to Europe have more parliamentary power at this moment probably than ever since 2016, if only because they have what Johnson most wants, the key to an election. In return they must keep open the negotiating option in the transition period and with it the possibility of a customs union, a Norwegian option, the resolution of the Irish border nonsense, and the avoidance of chaos in the labour market. Johnson has no need to concede these red rags to his fundamentalist bulls, just the possibility of them emerging from the eventual negotiation.</p> <p>How far the terms of the negotiation need to be written into the withdrawal bill is moot. Clearly, with trust in Johnson\u2019s intentions at a low ebb, flexibility is all. The opposition needs only seek a transitional negotiation that leaves open \u201ca\u201d customs union, if not \u201cthe\u201d one. Johnson has, after all, conceded one for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Everything will then be to play for next year. As the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, never ceases to remind us, the big battles are yet to come, in 2020. Those close to the Brussels negotiations have found parliament\u2019s obsession with the terms of withdrawal baffling and infuriating. It is the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU that should matter, and that is yet to be settled. It is not withdrawal that may need \u201cpostponing\u201d, but the UK\u2019s place in Europe\u2019s overall trading community. We are not yet done with border checks, alignments, quotas and tariffs. Those horrors lie ahead.</p> <p>Johnson is understandably frustrated by Downing Street\u2019s lack of control over events. He should be reminded, daily, that this crisis is his doing. He knows that an election could liberate him from the bondage of a hung parliament. But that is why he has everything to gain from getting his bill, however bastardised, through the present Commons. References to future trade deals are really neither here nor there. Like all Johnson\u2019s Don Giovanni promises, they are words suited to passing circumstance.</p> <p>For their part, remainers must see a residual interest in passing Johnson\u2019s bill. The nocturnal litany of \u201cwhy no\u201d simply has to shift to \u201chow yes\u201d. This requires not reason but the art of politics. That art has long been seen as the genius of the British constitution. It has guided parliament through crisis after crisis, from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Great Reform Act of 1832 and the Parliament Act of 1911. Britain\u2019s parliament at no point lost control of events, whether to the crown, the judges or the streets.</p> <p>An election is clearly needed. A government must be able to govern, a prime minister to lead. A new parliament should allow tempers to cool and some concept of a national interest to revive. Perhaps the remainers can yet redeem themselves. They can eliminate Corbyn\u2019s \u201crisk of a no-deal crash-out\u201d by agreeing Johnson\u2019s bill. They can try to keep open the option of a customs union and single market. They can soften Brexit as best they can. But that is for next year. For now, just pass the bill.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Ever since one of its former members, Boris Johnson, turned Caliban, he has roamed the political landscape, taunting his old associates at every turn. He threatens them with no-deal Brexits and general elections, and they shudder. He may be the weakest prime minister in recent history. But remainers have no idea how to respond. The prime minister now faces almost certain defeat over his rock-solid pledge, \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d, to leave the EU by 31 October. Assuming Brussels allows him to postpone Brexit to give him time to pass his withdrawal bill through parliament, he has two options. He can press ahead with that bill and risk delays and hostile amendments, or he can \u201cpause\u201d it and attempt instead to get a pre-Christmas general election, which should give him more room for manoeuvre. For that, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he needs Labour cooperation. In a bold bid to square the circle, Johnson has offered more time in parliament in return for Labour\u2019s agreement to an election date of 12 December. Labour must decide if it wants to be tied down in that way. In particular, will Johnson accept amendments to his bill over the next month that he might not like. He has one asset in hand: that the House of Commons has already voted on a second reading to pass his Brexit bill. He therefore needs only to survive the amendments stage. But his opponents would surely be wise to await the outcome of their amendments before agreeing to go to the country. Johnson should have every incentive to be extremely collaborative on such amendments. They might not suit some of his wilder backbenchers but they would get him from his present bind to where he wants to be, on the sunny uplands of an election campaign, where he is sure he can win a signal victory. Every tactical consideration should impel him towards a compromise on the bill \u2013 even if it might embrace a confirmatory referendum down the line. Just get it out of the way. Labour would be well advised to collaborate. Jeremy Corbyn and his disjointed band of remainers, half-leavers, soft-Brexiters and second-coming referendum-ers, have been wrongfooted at every turn. They should now concentrate on one thing, minimising the cost of Brexit to the economy. Their task should be to soften its impact. Now to stand in its way would see them massacred at the polls. Those eager to keep Britain as close as possible to Europe have more parliamentary power at this moment probably than ever since 2016, if only because they have what Johnson most wants, the key to an election. In return they must keep open the negotiating option in the transition period and with it the possibility of a customs union, a Norwegian option, the resolution of the Irish border nonsense, and the avoidance of chaos in the labour market. Johnson has no need to concede these red rags to his fundamentalist bulls, just the possibility of them emerging from the eventual negotiation. How far the terms of the negotiation need to be written into the withdrawal bill is moot. Clearly, with trust in Johnson\u2019s intentions at a low ebb, flexibility is all. The opposition needs only seek a transitional negotiation that leaves open \u201ca\u201d customs union, if not \u201cthe\u201d one. Johnson has, after all, conceded one for Northern Ireland. Everything will then be to play for next year. As the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, never ceases to remind us, the big battles are yet to come, in 2020. Those close to the Brussels negotiations have found parliament\u2019s obsession with the terms of withdrawal baffling and infuriating. It is the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU that should matter, and that is yet to be settled. It is not withdrawal that may need \u201cpostponing\u201d, but the UK\u2019s place in Europe\u2019s overall trading community. We are not yet done with border checks, alignments, quotas and tariffs. Those horrors lie ahead. Johnson is understandably frustrated by Downing Street\u2019s lack of control over events. He should be reminded, daily, that this crisis is his doing. He knows that an election could liberate him from the bondage of a hung parliament. But that is why he has everything to gain from getting his bill, however bastardised, through the present Commons. References to future trade deals are really neither here nor there. Like all Johnson\u2019s Don Giovanni promises, they are words suited to passing circumstance. For their part, remainers must see a residual interest in passing Johnson\u2019s bill. The nocturnal litany of \u201cwhy no\u201d simply has to shift to \u201chow yes\u201d. This requires not reason but the art of politics. That art has long been seen as the genius of the British constitution. It has guided parliament through crisis after crisis, from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Great Reform Act of 1832 and the Parliament Act of 1911. Britain\u2019s parliament at no point lost control of events, whether to the crown, the judges or the streets. An election is clearly needed. A government must be able to govern, a prime minister to lead. A new parliament should allow tempers to cool and some concept of a national interest to revive. Perhaps the remainers can yet redeem themselves. They can eliminate Corbyn\u2019s \u201crisk of a no-deal crash-out\u201d by agreeing Johnson\u2019s bill. They can try to keep open the option of a customs union and single market. They can soften Brexit as best they can. But that is for next year. For now, just pass the bill. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

In my teens (by which time most of the pink had gone) I worked as a cleaner in my local hospital as a holiday job, and brought a recently arrived Caribbean nurse home for a meal.

Hirsch is right to bemoan the government\u2019s failure to fund a memorial to the contribution made by people of black African origin to our society.

There\u2019s nothing more powerful than having the drugs in my pocket; the idea of what it can be. </p> <p>\u201cAnd, in a way, running is the same because there\u2019s this weird idea that you\u2019re going to enter a 100-miler and this time it\u2019s going to be different. This time it\u2019s not gonna hurt so much, and everything\u2019s going to be perfect.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/05/running-cured-anxiety-broken-heart\">How running cured my anxiety \u2013 and a broken heart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swapping substances for running \u2013 over any other sport \u2013 is common. The addiction and recovery website <a href=\"https://www.thefix.com/content/former-drunks-unstoppable-runners91097?page=all\">the Fix regularly publishes running articles</a>, and memoirs about this lifestyle swap include Catra Corbett\u2019s Reborn on the Run, Caleb Daniloff\u2019s Running Ransom Road and Catriona Menzies-Pike\u2019s The Long Run.</p> <p>In the case Menzies-Pike, the former \u201cgin-addled bookworm\u201d used to eye runners with suspicion as she nursed her lattes and hangovers. She\u2019d spent a decade adrift after the sudden death of her parents before it struck her that she\u2019d been preoccupied with distance and endurance and running away, so perhaps the logical answer was actual running.</p> <p>Now the Sydney-based editor has run five marathons.<br><br>\u201cI was not at a great point in my life,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI really hadn\u2019t dealt with the death of my mum and dad at all, but when I started running there was this quick conversion, and then a whole lot of other things started to fall more into an orderly shape. I started to sleep better and eat better, and I started getting trashed less. There was structure that came into my life.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks_HSj1UqKI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ks_HSj1UqKI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s an outcome echoed in new film Brittany Runs a Marathon, released in Australia on 31 October. Its title character \u2013 a heavy drinker who is overweight and has low self-esteem \u2013 hasn\u2019t processed the death of her father. She goes to the doctor hoping for a quick fix of Adderall but is instead prescribed exercise. Brittany decides to aim for the New York City Marathon and her training helps her get her life on track.</p> <p>Menzies-Pike says: \u201cRunning gave me a space to deal with the fact that I fucked up the grieving process. I found tremendous emotional variety in that space, and I would have these periods of total relaxation as I looked at a beautiful Sydney waterside view, and then other periods of experiencing physical resistance. Then there were periods of total emotional turmoil, where all of these suppressed feelings would rise up and I\u2019d be running against them.\u201d</p> <p>When a person gives up one dopaminergic behaviour, such as taking substances, they\u2019re likely to experience cross-addiction and chase the same sense of stimulation in something else. But why long-distance running in particular? Both behaviours require a capacity for endurance, provide a sense of release, can instil the intoxicating feeling of being an outlier, and can be solitary pursuits.</p> <p>The Sydney-based journalist Paul Maley is a trail runner who knocked his heavy drinking on its head four years ago to focus on his more active pursuit. He has now ticked off ultramarathons including the Blackall 100 and the 250km Big Red Run.</p> <p>\u201cIt became increasingly difficult [to run] as my drinking got heavier, to the point where a choice was required,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I chose running. You don\u2019t have to be Sigmund Freud to see the relationship there. In both cases you\u2019re chasing that dopamine or endorphin rush.\u201d</p> <p>Running produces boosts in dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the first instance, with the more hard-earned \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d of endorphins and \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-brain-effects-behind-runner-s-high/\">some researchers think</a> \u2013 an endocannabinoid called anandamide coming later.</p> <p>A person might reasonably expect that, when they give up substances their behaviour becomes less self-centred but, as Maley points, out: \u201cYou need to find other ways of coping with stress and managing your emotions. After I stopped drinking I was much more self-absorbed and spent much more time in my own head \u2013 no one tells you how self-absorbing the process is. Running was really good for stilling my mind because it\u2019s quite meditative.\u201d</p> <p>By her own admission, Menzies-Pike used to view runners with suspicion and, as Engle notes, extreme training can elicit more comments of concern from people than getting wasted ever did.</p> <p>\u201cPeople regularly ask me, \u2018Do you think that\u2019s healthy?\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m going to sound very judgmental, but I think people who criticise very likely feel badly about themselves. In my experience, it\u2019s rarely based in true concern. Because if they\u2019re around me enough, they\u2019re going to see how running makes me happy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cba1e4600fd3f8884c336e3cb1a4505bb7b24182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cba1e4600fd3f8884c336e3cb1a4505bb7b24182/0_0_1280_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Bench sips a colourful drink while wearing a hat and sunglasses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I literally ran myself into the ground,\u2019 says Lisa Bench. \u2018Exactly the same as with the booze\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It can be true that those with an all-or-nothing mindset may wind up overdoing it.

      "bodyText": "Even in his cocaine-bingeing years, which culminated in his car being shot at by drug dealers, Charlie Engle was the top salesman at the fitness club he worked at. You might call him a high achiever. Now Engle is an ultramarathon runner in some of the world\u2019s most inhospitable environments, and author of the memoir The Running Man. He tells Guardian Australia that, for him, part of the attraction is the pursuit of novelty. \u201cIn my view, drug taking is very much about chasing firsts,\u201d he says. \u201cThe absolute best I ever felt in relation to drugs was actually the acquisition of the drug. There\u2019s nothing more powerful than having the drugs in my pocket; the idea of what it can be. \u201cAnd, in a way, running is the same because there\u2019s this weird idea that you\u2019re going to enter a 100-miler and this time it\u2019s going to be different. This time it\u2019s not gonna hurt so much, and everything\u2019s going to be perfect.\u201d Swapping substances for running \u2013 over any other sport \u2013 is common. The addiction and recovery website the Fix regularly publishes running articles, and memoirs about this lifestyle swap include Catra Corbett\u2019s Reborn on the Run, Caleb Daniloff\u2019s Running Ransom Road and Catriona Menzies-Pike\u2019s The Long Run. In the case Menzies-Pike, the former \u201cgin-addled bookworm\u201d used to eye runners with suspicion as she nursed her lattes and hangovers. She\u2019d spent a decade adrift after the sudden death of her parents before it struck her that she\u2019d been preoccupied with distance and endurance and running away, so perhaps the logical answer was actual running. Now the Sydney-based editor has run five marathons. \u201cI was not at a great point in my life,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI really hadn\u2019t dealt with the death of my mum and dad at all, but when I started running there was this quick conversion, and then a whole lot of other things started to fall more into an orderly shape. I started to sleep better and eat better, and I started getting trashed less. There was structure that came into my life.\u201d It\u2019s an outcome echoed in new film Brittany Runs a Marathon, released in Australia on 31 October. Its title character \u2013 a heavy drinker who is overweight and has low self-esteem \u2013 hasn\u2019t processed the death of her father. She goes to the doctor hoping for a quick fix of Adderall but is instead prescribed exercise. Brittany decides to aim for the New York City Marathon and her training helps her get her life on track. Menzies-Pike says: \u201cRunning gave me a space to deal with the fact that I fucked up the grieving process. I found tremendous emotional variety in that space, and I would have these periods of total relaxation as I looked at a beautiful Sydney waterside view, and then other periods of experiencing physical resistance. Then there were periods of total emotional turmoil, where all of these suppressed feelings would rise up and I\u2019d be running against them.\u201d When a person gives up one dopaminergic behaviour, such as taking substances, they\u2019re likely to experience cross-addiction and chase the same sense of stimulation in something else. But why long-distance running in particular? Both behaviours require a capacity for endurance, provide a sense of release, can instil the intoxicating feeling of being an outlier, and can be solitary pursuits. The Sydney-based journalist Paul Maley is a trail runner who knocked his heavy drinking on its head four years ago to focus on his more active pursuit. He has now ticked off ultramarathons including the Blackall 100 and the 250km Big Red Run. \u201cIt became increasingly difficult [to run] as my drinking got heavier, to the point where a choice was required,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I chose running. You don\u2019t have to be Sigmund Freud to see the relationship there. In both cases you\u2019re chasing that dopamine or endorphin rush.\u201d Running produces boosts in dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the first instance, with the more hard-earned \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d of endorphins and \u2013 some researchers think \u2013 an endocannabinoid called anandamide coming later. A person might reasonably expect that, when they give up substances their behaviour becomes less self-centred but, as Maley points, out: \u201cYou need to find other ways of coping with stress and managing your emotions. After I stopped drinking I was much more self-absorbed and spent much more time in my own head \u2013 no one tells you how self-absorbing the process is. Running was really good for stilling my mind because it\u2019s quite meditative.\u201d By her own admission, Menzies-Pike used to view runners with suspicion and, as Engle notes, extreme training can elicit more comments of concern from people than getting wasted ever did. \u201cPeople regularly ask me, \u2018Do you think that\u2019s healthy?\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m going to sound very judgmental, but I think people who criticise very likely feel badly about themselves. In my experience, it\u2019s rarely based in true concern. Because if they\u2019re around me enough, they\u2019re going to see how running makes me happy.\u201d It can be true that those with an all-or-nothing mindset may wind up overdoing it. That was the case for Lisa Bench, a Newcastle-based administrative assistant. \u201cI literally ran myself into the ground,\u201d she says. \u201cExactly the same as with the booze.\u201d When she stopped drinking, Bench was drawn to the sugar she was missing in alcohol. To counteract her unhealthy diet, she decided she needed to exercise excessively. \u201cI started on the treadmill but I didn\u2019t want to be known as that chick at the gym on the treadmill for 90 minutes, Monday to Sunday,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause then you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d So she started pounding the pavement where people might not notice; first 5km, then nine, right up to 24 \u2013 all before getting to the office by 8.30am, buzzing. Tracking her progress with apps made her more obsessive. \u201cI\u2019d think, \u2018Maybe I could not put makeup on today. Maybe I could get away with not washing my hair so that I can get more of the run in. I\u2019ve got an eating disorder as well, because that\u2019s closely linked with alcoholism, and I was running on practically nothing.\u201d She became thin and exhausted with an unshakeable headache, so she finally took heed of her husband\u2019s pleading and took a day off. She went to see an acupuncturist and stopped running altogether. But she feels restless. \u201cI get bored so quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about escaping reality for me.\u201d Engle says: \u201cI see tons of addiction in the running community that doesn\u2019t necessarily manifest in drugs but in other behaviours. There is something that\u2019s not fulfilled. It\u2019s not a negative, it\u2019s just a space that needs to be filled with something other than normal living \u2013 because I personally don\u2019t have any interest in being in that safe middle ground.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The tribunal tasked with hearing tens of thousands of refugee appeals, as well reviewing other visa, tax, child support and workers compensation decisions, is struggling under a growing workload despite record clearance rates. The administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) received, finalised and was left with the highest number of applications on record last year. However its annual report, released on Wednesday, revealed it is not keeping pace with the growing number of cases, or with the clearance targets set by the federal budget. The AAT hears appeals of administrative decisions made under commonwealth law, including those related to workers compensation, child support and tax. The migration and refugee division \u2013 which hears appeals on visa and protection claims \u2013 forms about 86% of its caseload, but has a clearance rate of just 58%. The tribunal finalised 44,413 cases in 2018-19, 11% more than the previous year and more than it expected to complete, but still 3% below the targets set in the most recent federal budget. \u201cThis is due to the fact that the AAT\u2019s ability to finalise applications is primarily dependent on the resources, particularly the number of members, available to deal with our caseload,\u201d the report said. The AAT\u2019s struggles with its growing caseload, and criticisms of government appointments to its membership have dogged the institution. It received more than 60,500 applications in the last financial year, but while it finalised more than in previous years, it was left with 30% more on hand by the end of June. The 58% clearance rate in the refugee and migration division was 11 percentage points higher than the previous year but continued \u201cto be affected by sustained high level of lodgements and the lower than required number of people and financial resources currently available to undertake that work\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Almost 60,000 refugee and migration appeals are currently before the AAT, forming 86% of the entire AAT load. Despite a 5% drop in the number of cases lodged and a 16% increase in the number finalised, there remained 34% more active cases on hand than the previous year. The growing backlog is partly explained by statistics which show far fewer cases were finalised within 12 months of lodgement. That rate fell from 57% in 2017-18 to just 36%. The majority of active cases \u2013 65% \u2013 related to migration cases. The report said the division had focused on finalising older and more complex cases, as well as cases of visa cancellations, a strategy which the AAT said had contributed to a longer average time. Visa cancellations, including those under the controversial Section 501 character provisions, have repeatedly made headlines in recent years as the federal government seeks to broaden the parameters by which it can cancel visas. Almost 60% of all AAT cases about protection visas were lodged by Malaysian nationals, a cohort of people currently subject to concerns about worker exploitation. A parliamentary inquiry found in February that organised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies were taking advantage of immigration laws to exploit workers who were waiting for their claims to be processed \u2013 which in some cases can take up to eight years and which has cost $46m in the past three years. It applied mostly to Malaysians on electronic travel authorities. \u201cThese individuals are exploiting Australia\u2019s protection visa and merits review systems by repeatedly applying for merits review of the decision to refuse their protection visa application, allowing them to stay in Australia for a significant amount of time and seek employment,\u201d the parliamentary inquiry found. The report said 9% of all finalised refugee case reviews were remitted back to the department of home affairs for reassessment, up from 5% the previous year. The report said the low proportion of decisions being overturned was due to the volume of cases brought by Malaysians who were mostly found not to be refugees. AAT reviews affirmed the department\u2019s original decision in 57% of cases, dismissed 19% for not meeting application requirements and 5% for the applicant failing to appear. Ten per cent of cases were withdrawn. A trial of new powers, which allow an AAT member to authorise a senior staff member to take evidence from an applicant on the member\u2019s behalf, saw a marked increase in case clearance rates, increasing from 47% overall to 58%. As the number and proportion of refugee and migration cases grew, the AAT has continued to divert additional resources to the division, including additional members and the cross-assignment of members from elsewhere. However, with recent appointments the number of members in the migration and refugee division is still not yet at the levels prior to July 2015 when there were half the number of applications. \u201cA further increase in the number of members and staff, together with legislative changes to enhance our case management options and powers, is needed to address the backlog and sustained high level of lodgements,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "A leading Australian climate scientist has said his views have been misrepresented by conservative media commentators, who have used a \u201cmisspoken\u201d statement to dismiss the links between climate change and drought. Prof Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales, has told Guardian Australia there are clear links between human-caused climate change and drought, but these links are indirect. A statement Pitman made to an event in June has been used repeatedly in recent weeks by Sky News commentators, including Alan Jones, Chris Kenny and Andrew Bolt, to undermine the impacts of climate change on drought, despite Pitman\u2019s centre issuing a clarification weeks earlier. In some cases similar comments were also made in the commentators\u2019 News Corp columns. In a June event at the University of New South Wales, Pitman told an audience there was \u201cno link between climate change and drought\u201d. He told Guardian Australia: \u201cI misspoke \u2013 I missed a word in my statement and that\u2019s my fault. I should have said no \u2018direct\u2019 link. \u201cI\u2019m confident in the statement that there is no direct link between climate change and drought. I\u2019m equally certain that for some regions there\u2019s an indirect effect of human-induced climate change on drought because of the change in rainfall patterns.\u201d He said increases in temperatures caused by human activity would also make the impacts of drought worse. He said: \u201cBackground warming does mean that when you get a drought, the system is more stressed than it otherwise would be.\u201d He said, for example, that farmers would need to get more water to livestock under higher temperatures. Pitman said he had declined invitations to be interviewed on Sky because he felt he would be unable to communicate nuances on their programs \u201cin such a way that their listeners won\u2019t be misled\u201d. \u201cBut I have not been contacted by Alan Jones or Andrew Bolt,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath waiting for them to correct the record.\u201d Sky News presenters have used the statement to attack government ministers, including the water minister, David Littleproud, for refusing to rule out the role of climate change on droughts. On The Bolt report, host Andrew Bolt said: \u201cEven one of our most committed climate scientists, Professor Andy Pitman, admits there is no link between global warming and drought.\u201d In an interview with shadow agriculture minister Joel Fitzgibbon, Sky host Chris Kenny played audio of Pitman\u2019s statement, before adding: \u201cIf that\u2019s what the science says then politicians who link the current disasters to climate change are being opportunistic and misleading.\u201d Asked if he felt his views were being misrepresented, Pitman said: \u201cAbsolutely, yes. But it\u2019s understandable from my statement that some people misunderstood what I was saying. \u201cPeople want black and white, but drought is not simple. I understand that the reporting of science is always complex and it\u2019s hopelessly naive to think all the media wants to report the facts without fear or favour. So no, I\u2019m not surprised [at the reaction].\u201d Pitman\u2019s misspoken statement was the subject of a segment on ABC\u2019s Media Watch program, prompting a furious public exchange between host Paul Barry and Bolt. According to the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s most recent State of the Climate report, the \u201cdrying in recent decades across southern Australia is the most sustained large-scale change in rainfall since national records began in 1900\u201d. Areas around the north of the Murray-Darling Basin have also experienced record low rainfall, the bureau has said. Pitman said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t answer\u201d a question on whether the current drought gripping large areas of south-east Australia had been influenced by climate change. \u201cBut the fact that I can\u2019t establish something does not make it true or false, it just means I can\u2019t establish it.\u201d He also said there were \u201climits to our knowledge\u201d on what would happen to drought over the coming decades in Australia. But Pitman said there were clear links between human-induced climate change and a rise in heatwaves, in frequency of extreme heat, on changes in rainfall, on ocean acidification and sea level rise. \u201cThe average temperatures are increasing, the maximums are increasing, the lowest temperatures are increasing,\u201d Pitman said. \u201cWe know lots of stuff, and all of that is enough to ask for deep cuts in emissions.\u201d Pitman pointed to research showing that, between 2000 and 2014, for every cold temperature record being set in Australia, 12 heat records were being broken. \u201cBeing able to attribute a particular drought to climate change should not have any implications for the deep cuts to emissions that are necessary to avoid dangerous climate change.\u201d",

Some reefs avoided the worst effects \u2013but the cumulative impacts of multiple, frequent events reduced coral cover and diversity.\u201d On reefs around the Whitsunday Islands, one of the most popular destinations in the Great Barrier Reef marine park, coral cover had been relatively stable until 2016, after coral bleaching and then Cyclone Debbie saw a sharp drop in hard corals. Ceccarelli said that even though the findings were shocking, there were still many stunning areas for tourists and divers to visit around the islands, including the Whitsundays where some individual reefs were in excellent condition.

Scientists are concerned that major coral bleaching and heat stress events caused by ocean heating will hit the Great Barrier Reef at intervals too short to let corals recover. The reef, the world\u2019s biggest coral reef system, was hit by major bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, with impacts concentrated in the northern parts of the reef. The study also questioned a previous conclusion that corals on inshore reefs were more tolerant of higher temperatures.

I inquired about a mutual friend who I hadn\u2019t seen in awhile but I keep in touch with via Twitter. \u201cShe sure is on there a lot,\u201d I said (in retrospect kind of bitchily). \u201cI think she might be addicted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d replied my friend. \u201cBecause a lot of people say that about <em>you</em>.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s always shocking when people hand you a mirror. But were <em>a lot of people</em> right?</p> <p>I checked screen time on my phone. Last week I was averaged 3 hours and 21 minutes per day, which was down 31% from the week before. On Thursday I picked up my phone 122 times. What am I? Some kind of addict?</p> <p>My editor sets me a target to be on my phone for no more than an hour a day \u2013 which includes not only tweets and Instagram, but phone calls, WhatsApp, maps, podcasts, camera, music, texts and email. Even checking the time counts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/15/the-fridge-the-dead-mouse-and-the-perils-of-youtube-tutorials\">The fridge, the dead mouse and the perils of YouTube tutorials | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Day 1</strong></h2> <p>I begin the challenge at lunchtime and change all my settings to \u201cdowntime\u201d between 10am and 6am the following morning \u2013 which means for 20 hours a day I have to go through a tedious unlocking process if I want to use my phone.</p> <p><strong>1pm:</strong> I\u2019m in a cafe by myself writing a complicated piece on my (disabled) laptop, when the itch starts. It\u2019s an urge to check my phone. The more stuck I am with this story, the stronger the itch. The urge is a complicated one to unpick. Is it a distraction from the difficult work? Is it the need for connection? Is it dopamine-seeking? Whatever the urge is, it feels almost physical. Like addiction feels.</p> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Standing at the edge of Bronte rockpool on a beautiful day. Usually I would do an Instagram story, but my camera and the Instagram app are locked. I may have had time to quickly post the photo but I would lose time checking likes. On my way to the beach I\u2019m annoyed that I can\u2019t listen to a podcast and instead have to listen to leaf blowers and circular saws. On the way back home, I get lost taking a shortcut but resist looking at Google maps. Time lost on my phone morphs into time lost being \u2026 lost.</p> <p><strong>11pm:</strong> I have 13 minutes left and want to save them for late night WhatsApp with friends in different time zones \u2013 which I do almost frantically at 11pm \u2013 toggling between three different chats before the timer I have set cuts me off midway through a sentence, like I\u2019ve died or something.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> An hour less than usual spent on phone.</p> <h2><strong>Day 2</strong></h2> <p>My editor texts \u2013 she owes me money and can now pay me back. Could I send her my account details? NO! I CANNOT. Too much screen time involved.</p> <p>A minute later I have a story published and I tweet it and like a couple of other tweets. My editor texts to ask what I am doing on Twitter if I am meant to be restricting myself. More time lost replying to text.</p> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Walking without music or podcast. Tedious, as stuck with own thoughts. Get lost again. Will not waste precious minutes looking at maps. Instead just decide to walk and greet people. Three times last week people in the street said hello to me, and so great was my shock that I fumbled my response. Now, without my phone, I can greet and be greeted. But everyone I pass is wearing buds, lost in the world of their phones.</p> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> I have used all my minutes for the day. Feel pained as I now have to take a bus without comfort of phone. There is a baby wailing all the way down Oxford Street and a man next to me who is confused and raving. I can\u2019t escape my fellow citizens by blocking them out with earbuds and music \u2013 so I fully engage. I make unbroken eye contact with the baby and listen to the man. I am running late and can\u2019t text my friend as I have no minutes left, but that is OK.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> 2.5 hours less than usual spent on phone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/eagle-hunters-yurts-and-greasy-mutton-how-food-poisoning-in-mongolia-brought-me-closer-to-nature\">Eagle hunters, yurts and greasy mutton: how food poisoning in Mongolia brought me closer to nature | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Day 3</strong></h2> <p>I plan to sleep for as long as I can so as to have less time in the day to not use my phone.</p> <p>Less hours awake will mean less temptation.</p> <p>I wake naturally at 9:45am and let my group chat know. \u201cI am awak\u201d (sic). I see by looking at my phone that some of them have been awak since 4:45am, tending to young children confused by daylight saving.</p> <p>Someone in my chat responds to me: \u201cFuck you.\u201d Sadly I can\u2019t spend much time engaging with his negative comments as it will use up precious phone minutes.</p> <p>Quick check of Twitter.

Ah, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/people-entertainment/2019/10/24/michael-leunig-cartoon-mothers/\">the cartoonist Michael Leunig</a>. I join the pile-on and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrigidWD/status/1186793939866488832\">fire off a tweet.</a> The tweet is short \u2013 to minimise time online \u2013 \u201cMichael Leunig fell out of a pram.\u201d It barely makes sense but almost immediately, before I have a chance to put my phone down, it\u2019s getting lots of likes.</p> <p>Ugh. Shouldn\u2019t have tweeted. So deeply have I internalised the rhythms and rewards of checking for likes that I become sucked in again, checking and making more jokes about Leunig.</p> <p>By lunchtime I have spent 33 minutes on my phone, most of those minutes Leunig-related. Start to loathe self and Leunig. Aware of the meta elements of this due to his cartoon being about people who spend too much time on their phone. Whatever Leunig \u2014 you suck.</p> <p>Decide to put phone in different room. But then just as I am doing so, disaster strikes. It is my neighbour in central Victoria. She texts me. She has just been checking up on my house while I am in Sydney and found \u201cA big brown at the top of the driveway, shed. You want me to leave key inside shed?

      "bodyText": "Recently I ran into an old friend on a morning walk. I inquired about a mutual friend who I hadn\u2019t seen in awhile but I keep in touch with via Twitter. \u201cShe sure is on there a lot,\u201d I said (in retrospect kind of bitchily). \u201cI think she might be addicted.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d replied my friend. \u201cBecause a lot of people say that about you.\u201d It\u2019s always shocking when people hand you a mirror. But were a lot of people right? I checked screen time on my phone. Last week I was averaged 3 hours and 21 minutes per day, which was down 31% from the week before. On Thursday I picked up my phone 122 times. What am I? Some kind of addict? My editor sets me a target to be on my phone for no more than an hour a day \u2013 which includes not only tweets and Instagram, but phone calls, WhatsApp, maps, podcasts, camera, music, texts and email. Even checking the time counts. Day 1 I begin the challenge at lunchtime and change all my settings to \u201cdowntime\u201d between 10am and 6am the following morning \u2013 which means for 20 hours a day I have to go through a tedious unlocking process if I want to use my phone. 1pm: I\u2019m in a cafe by myself writing a complicated piece on my (disabled) laptop, when the itch starts. It\u2019s an urge to check my phone. The more stuck I am with this story, the stronger the itch. The urge is a complicated one to unpick. Is it a distraction from the difficult work? Is it the need for connection? Is it dopamine-seeking? Whatever the urge is, it feels almost physical. Like addiction feels. 4pm: Standing at the edge of Bronte rockpool on a beautiful day. Usually I would do an Instagram story, but my camera and the Instagram app are locked. I may have had time to quickly post the photo but I would lose time checking likes. On my way to the beach I\u2019m annoyed that I can\u2019t listen to a podcast and instead have to listen to leaf blowers and circular saws. On the way back home, I get lost taking a shortcut but resist looking at Google maps. Time lost on my phone morphs into time lost being \u2026 lost. 11pm: I have 13 minutes left and want to save them for late night WhatsApp with friends in different time zones \u2013 which I do almost frantically at 11pm \u2013 toggling between three different chats before the timer I have set cuts me off midway through a sentence, like I\u2019ve died or something. Result: An hour less than usual spent on phone. Day 2 My editor texts \u2013 she owes me money and can now pay me back. Could I send her my account details? NO! I CANNOT. Too much screen time involved. A minute later I have a story published and I tweet it and like a couple of other tweets. My editor texts to ask what I am doing on Twitter if I am meant to be restricting myself. More time lost replying to text. 3pm: Walking without music or podcast. Tedious, as stuck with own thoughts. Get lost again. Will not waste precious minutes looking at maps. Instead just decide to walk and greet people. Three times last week people in the street said hello to me, and so great was my shock that I fumbled my response. Now, without my phone, I can greet and be greeted. But everyone I pass is wearing buds, lost in the world of their phones. 5pm: I have used all my minutes for the day. Feel pained as I now have to take a bus without comfort of phone. There is a baby wailing all the way down Oxford Street and a man next to me who is confused and raving. I can\u2019t escape my fellow citizens by blocking them out with earbuds and music \u2013 so I fully engage. I make unbroken eye contact with the baby and listen to the man. I am running late and can\u2019t text my friend as I have no minutes left, but that is OK. Result: 2.5 hours less than usual spent on phone. Day 3 I plan to sleep for as long as I can so as to have less time in the day to not use my phone. Less hours awake will mean less temptation. I wake naturally at 9:45am and let my group chat know. \u201cI am awak\u201d (sic). I see by looking at my phone that some of them have been awak since 4:45am, tending to young children confused by daylight saving. Someone in my chat responds to me: \u201cFuck you.\u201d Sadly I can\u2019t spend much time engaging with his negative comments as it will use up precious phone minutes. Quick check of Twitter. Who is everyone hating today? I must know!!! Ah, it\u2019s the cartoonist Michael Leunig. I join the pile-on and fire off a tweet. The tweet is short \u2013 to minimise time online \u2013 \u201cMichael Leunig fell out of a pram.\u201d It barely makes sense but almost immediately, before I have a chance to put my phone down, it\u2019s getting lots of likes. Ugh. Shouldn\u2019t have tweeted. So deeply have I internalised the rhythms and rewards of checking for likes that I become sucked in again, checking and making more jokes about Leunig. By lunchtime I have spent 33 minutes on my phone, most of those minutes Leunig-related. Start to loathe self and Leunig. Aware of the meta elements of this due to his cartoon being about people who spend too much time on their phone. Whatever Leunig \u2014 you suck. Decide to put phone in different room. But then just as I am doing so, disaster strikes. It is my neighbour in central Victoria. She texts me. She has just been checking up on my house while I am in Sydney and found \u201cA big brown at the top of the driveway, shed. You want me to leave key inside shed? Snake can go under door inside.\u201d No! I have Airbnb guests arriving the following day. I will need to call them and possibly a snake catcher. More minutes lost! I tweet my fears. Meanwhile my practical neighbour has hand-cut the grass where the snake appeared. She texts: \u201cSnake went to where I had cut. Brave yes. .. I didn\u2019t see him again \u2026 gone. They move on. Welcome to rural.\u201d I reply, saying people on Twitter are scaring me. \u201cThey say it can get into linen cupboards!\u201d She responds: \u201cThat\u2019s yr friends.\u201d Meanwhile, back on Twitter, my followers (\u201cyr friends\u201d) are increasingly worried for my safety, thinking I\u2019m near the snake. I am in Tamarama, I tweet back. Nowhere near snake. This snake is taking up even more time than checking Leunig likes. Will need to disengage. But if I do, people on Twitter might assume snake killed me. 4pm: Decide to go for long walk and leave phone at home to avoid using phone again. Already I\u2019m at 59 minutes.

The poll from Cardiff University and the University of Edinburgh asked respondents what they would be prepared to see happen in order to leave or remain within the European Union. This included a question on whether achieving their desired political outcome was worth the risk of violence being directed against MPs. Most leave voters who took part in the Future of England study thought such a possibility was a \u201cprice worth paying\u201d for Brexit to be delivered \u2013 71% in England, 60% in Scotland and 70% in Wales. The majority of remain voters felt that the risk of violence towards MPs was worth it if it meant we would stay in the EU \u2013 58% in England, 53% in Scotland and 56% in Wales. The survey did not imply that the responder would conduct the violence themselve or specify that the violence would be severe or even be carried out by those on the same political side as them. Richard Wyn Jones, a professor of Welsh politics at Cardiff University who co-directed the research, said he had been \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the results, given the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox before the referendum in 2016 and recent threats made towards other MPs. \u201cIf we\u2019re going into a general election in which polarisation is the name of the game, it\u2019s very, very hard to see how you can bind these wounds,\u201d said Wyn Jones. Most people who responded to the survey also thought that violence towards MPs and violent protests in which people are \u201cbadly injured\u201d were likely to occur if and when Brexit happens. \u201cI think this division is now existential,\u201d Wyn Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s about who we think we are and who we think we\u2019re not. It\u2019s very hard to see how the state of the union in its current form survives Brexit.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we\u2019re going into a general election in which further polarisation is a deliberate aim of the campaigning of at least some of the political parties, you do wonder in all seriousness where all of this ends.\u201d Of the 4,103 politically representative respondents, a significant number \u2013 47% in Wales, 52% in England and 61% in Scotland \u2013 thought that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU would likely lead to the breakup of the UK.

Among leave voters, 74% in England, the same percentage in Wales and 59% in Scotland believed the breakup of the UK would be worth it to take back control through delivering Brexit. Similar proportions of remainers believed undermining faith in the union would be a price worth paying in order to remain in the EU. Ailsa Henderson, a professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh and fellow co-director of the research, said the findings showed that Brexit negotiations were \u201cputting the union under considerable strain regardless of whether we stay or go\u201d.

      "body": "<p>This week, protesters blocked the entry of the Museum of Modern Art, recently reopened after a massive expansion project. They were calling for the removal of Steven Tananbaum from MoMA\u2019s board, because his firm GoldenTree Asset Management owns $2.5bn in debt from Puerto Rico. With their banners reading #CANCELTHEDEBT, they filled the lobby until the police came and the arrests began.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/oct/24/trump-news-today-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-2020-latest-updates\">Democratic congressman Tim Ryan drops out of 2020 White House race \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If all of this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because these protests followed other protests in front of MoMA only a few days before, against the involvement of trustee Larry Fink and the museum\u2019s investments in private prisons.</p> <p>Or maybe you\u2019re thinking about the same kind of protests that recently took over the Whitney Museum for their association with Warren B Kanders and his company Safariland, which produces \u201cdefense technologies\u201d like the teargas that was used against migrants at the US-Mexico border and protesters in Puerto Rico.</p> <p>Or the protests that flooded the Guggenheim Museum with protesters led by legendary artist Nan Goldin for their association with the Sacklers, who founded Purdue Pharmaceuticals, who are responsible for the opioid crisis through their aggressive pushing of the drug oxycodone.</p> <p>These protests seem noble, but they are ideologically inconsistent. If the idea is to cleanse the art world of its ties to money created through suffering and oppression, then why stop with these singular figures? The boards of each museum are still cluttered with billionaires who made their fortunes through defense contracts, fossil fuels and pharmaceuticals. As <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/benefactors-and-malefactors-wimbish\">Whitney Curry Wimbish documented</a> for The Baffler, sitting next to Kanders on the Whitney board are men and women who created weapons used on Palestinians, sold military equipment to Pakistan, and built drones. (Kanders did ultimately resign, and the other billionaires remain.)</p> <p>These protests are often led by artist and curators, and there are some very good reasons why they don\u2019t call for the museums to remove all of the billionaires from their board or to divest entirely from unethical investments. Some artists \u2013 the type who are selected for inclusion at MoMA or the Whitney Biennial or at least believe they might in the future have the opportunity to be \u2013 benefit greatly from their access to billionaire trustees and collectors, and while they might gain some cultural capital from showing off their social consciousness by singling out specific problematic individuals, they probably don\u2019t want to risk alienating all of the moneyed class.</p> <p>Take the Whitney Biennial protests that began with an open letter from artists and critics Hannah Black, Ciar\u00e1n Finlayson and Tobi Haslett, asking the artists included in the exhibition of new work to withdraw their art in protest of Kanders\u2019s refusal to resign from the museum\u2019s board. The open letter came months after the Biennial had begun, meaning the artists who were included had already benefited greatly from having their work be displayed on their prestigious walls and being written about in the promotional materials and the press surrounding the biannual event. When some of the artists did withdraw following the protest, they got a second round of press, congratulating them on being so committed to their ideals. And yes, they probably are, but it worked out well for them to benefit financially and in publicity both coming and going.</p> <p>Only one artist, Chicago-based Michael Rakowitz, refused to participate in the exhibition from the very beginning, and there was significantly less coverage and social media chatter about his decision and the consequences of his stand than there was of the protests that followed.</p> <p>The billionaires of course benefit greatly from their association with the museums, using their collections and their philanthropic work to launder their reputations. Stefan Edlis, a billionaire who created his fortune with the plastics that are now choking our oceans, being found in our bodies and and killing dolphins and sea turtles, made a significant donation to the Art Institute of 44 paintings by figures like Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.</p> <p>While Edlis was heralded up and down the arts press for his generosity, less has been discussed about how he benefits. The gift was given with a guarantee that his paintings would be on permanent display for 50 years, and they must remain in the order selected by Edlis for the next 25.</p> <p>Whether or not art museums need more Warhol should be up for debate (though they really don\u2019t). We shouldn\u2019t let Edlis control what art and artists the next two generations of the Chicago public gets to sees. While art museums around the country are finally taking pains to diversify their collections and display more work by artists of different genders, sexualities, and races \u2013 in Baltimore the museum actually decided to <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/baltimore-deaccessioning-proceeds-1309481\">sell </a><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/baltimore-deaccessioning-proceeds-1309481\">one of its Warhols</a> to invest in less high-profile but significant artists like Amy Sherald and Jack Whitten \u2013 the Art Institute has been coerced into spending a significant part of their real estate promoting the same white men we\u2019ve all seen a million times before. In the process, Edlis\u2019s profile as a collector rises, the rest of the art in his collection will probably raise in value, and he gets greater access to dealers, artists and museums.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/24/trump-colorado-wall-awkward-not-a-border-state\">'Well, this is awkward': Trump mocked after saying he\u2019s building a border wall in Colorado</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be easy to say that all money under capitalism is corrupt so what can we possibly do? Well, I do know one thing we could do. We could nationalize the art museums.</p> <p>I know, it\u2019s crazy, utopian thinking that wouldn\u2019t even work. The National Endowment for the Arts has the budget of a nursery school at this point, and a Republican administration would delight in shutting down the Metropolitan Museum of Art, their palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.</p> <p>But having billionaires run our art and culture has real world effects. Going to an art museum in any major city will cost you around $25. That\u2019s how much it costs for the Whitney and MoMA, the Art Institute in Chicago and Lacma in Los Angeles. It is the same for the Met, and they recently got rid of their \u201cpay what you can\u201d policy of discounted tickets for anyone who is not a New York City resident. The Art Institute has radically cut its schedule of free days, and also only offers them now to those with ID proving Chicago residence. It\u2019s not just visual art, it\u2019s the opera, the symphony and other venues for the so-called \u201chigh arts\u201d, too, which relies on massive donations and still charges exorbitant prices.</p> <p>A large population of people is effectively shut out from participating in the art world as a result, even as an audience member. And it has created an art world by billionaires and for billionaires, who use their wealth to manipulate the museums for their own ends, to increase the value of their private collections. Why, then, would they care if members of the working and lower classes are unable to afford a ticket to spend an afternoon around great art?</p> <p>If people are serious about removing the dark money from the art market and creating an ethical art world, the first thing that should happen is to put control of the museums, which were originally created as a public good, back in the hands of the people. When the United States can\u2019t even get national healthcare, it\u2019s hard to argue for subsidized art museums and opera, but a girl can dream.</p> <p>Why would conservatives ever agree to raise taxes for decadent, godless artists? It\u2019s not just holdovers from the 1990s cultural wars, the younger generation in the alt-right talks a lot about how elitist and lacking in meaning the contemporary art world is. Part of that hostility, I think, and I am speaking from personal experience as someone raised in rural Kansas by parents who thought things like art and novels were a waste of time, is the feeling of high art not being <em>for us</em>. Of feeling belittled and excluded by the art world, because, basically, we \u2013 the working class, the rural, the Red Staters \u2013 are.</p> <p>Rebuilding the idea that art is for everyone, to create and to enjoy and to learn about, starts with access. Open your doors to the uncultured and the unwashed! Talk about the value of art in a language other than money! Allow someone other than the pampered children of hedge fund managers to write and speak about art! Nationalize the art museums! We have to start somewhere.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast<br></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "This week, protesters blocked the entry of the Museum of Modern Art, recently reopened after a massive expansion project. They were calling for the removal of Steven Tananbaum from MoMA\u2019s board, because his firm GoldenTree Asset Management owns $2.5bn in debt from Puerto Rico. With their banners reading #CANCELTHEDEBT, they filled the lobby until the police came and the arrests began. If all of this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because these protests followed other protests in front of MoMA only a few days before, against the involvement of trustee Larry Fink and the museum\u2019s investments in private prisons. Or maybe you\u2019re thinking about the same kind of protests that recently took over the Whitney Museum for their association with Warren B Kanders and his company Safariland, which produces \u201cdefense technologies\u201d like the teargas that was used against migrants at the US-Mexico border and protesters in Puerto Rico. Or the protests that flooded the Guggenheim Museum with protesters led by legendary artist Nan Goldin for their association with the Sacklers, who founded Purdue Pharmaceuticals, who are responsible for the opioid crisis through their aggressive pushing of the drug oxycodone. These protests seem noble, but they are ideologically inconsistent. If the idea is to cleanse the art world of its ties to money created through suffering and oppression, then why stop with these singular figures? The boards of each museum are still cluttered with billionaires who made their fortunes through defense contracts, fossil fuels and pharmaceuticals. As Whitney Curry Wimbish documented for The Baffler, sitting next to Kanders on the Whitney board are men and women who created weapons used on Palestinians, sold military equipment to Pakistan, and built drones. (Kanders did ultimately resign, and the other billionaires remain.) These protests are often led by artist and curators, and there are some very good reasons why they don\u2019t call for the museums to remove all of the billionaires from their board or to divest entirely from unethical investments. Some artists \u2013 the type who are selected for inclusion at MoMA or the Whitney Biennial or at least believe they might in the future have the opportunity to be \u2013 benefit greatly from their access to billionaire trustees and collectors, and while they might gain some cultural capital from showing off their social consciousness by singling out specific problematic individuals, they probably don\u2019t want to risk alienating all of the moneyed class. Take the Whitney Biennial protests that began with an open letter from artists and critics Hannah Black, Ciar\u00e1n Finlayson and Tobi Haslett, asking the artists included in the exhibition of new work to withdraw their art in protest of Kanders\u2019s refusal to resign from the museum\u2019s board. The open letter came months after the Biennial had begun, meaning the artists who were included had already benefited greatly from having their work be displayed on their prestigious walls and being written about in the promotional materials and the press surrounding the biannual event. When some of the artists did withdraw following the protest, they got a second round of press, congratulating them on being so committed to their ideals. And yes, they probably are, but it worked out well for them to benefit financially and in publicity both coming and going. Only one artist, Chicago-based Michael Rakowitz, refused to participate in the exhibition from the very beginning, and there was significantly less coverage and social media chatter about his decision and the consequences of his stand than there was of the protests that followed. The billionaires of course benefit greatly from their association with the museums, using their collections and their philanthropic work to launder their reputations. Stefan Edlis, a billionaire who created his fortune with the plastics that are now choking our oceans, being found in our bodies and and killing dolphins and sea turtles, made a significant donation to the Art Institute of 44 paintings by figures like Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly. While Edlis was heralded up and down the arts press for his generosity, less has been discussed about how he benefits. The gift was given with a guarantee that his paintings would be on permanent display for 50 years, and they must remain in the order selected by Edlis for the next 25. Whether or not art museums need more Warhol should be up for debate (though they really don\u2019t). We shouldn\u2019t let Edlis control what art and artists the next two generations of the Chicago public gets to sees. While art museums around the country are finally taking pains to diversify their collections and display more work by artists of different genders, sexualities, and races \u2013 in Baltimore the museum actually decided to sell one of its Warhols to invest in less high-profile but significant artists like Amy Sherald and Jack Whitten \u2013 the Art Institute has been coerced into spending a significant part of their real estate promoting the same white men we\u2019ve all seen a million times before. In the process, Edlis\u2019s profile as a collector rises, the rest of the art in his collection will probably raise in value, and he gets greater access to dealers, artists and museums. It would be easy to say that all money under capitalism is corrupt so what can we possibly do? Well, I do know one thing we could do. We could nationalize the art museums. I know, it\u2019s crazy, utopian thinking that wouldn\u2019t even work. The National Endowment for the Arts has the budget of a nursery school at this point, and a Republican administration would delight in shutting down the Metropolitan Museum of Art, their palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it. But having billionaires run our art and culture has real world effects. Going to an art museum in any major city will cost you around $25. That\u2019s how much it costs for the Whitney and MoMA, the Art Institute in Chicago and Lacma in Los Angeles. It is the same for the Met, and they recently got rid of their \u201cpay what you can\u201d policy of discounted tickets for anyone who is not a New York City resident. The Art Institute has radically cut its schedule of free days, and also only offers them now to those with ID proving Chicago residence. It\u2019s not just visual art, it\u2019s the opera, the symphony and other venues for the so-called \u201chigh arts\u201d, too, which relies on massive donations and still charges exorbitant prices. A large population of people is effectively shut out from participating in the art world as a result, even as an audience member. And it has created an art world by billionaires and for billionaires, who use their wealth to manipulate the museums for their own ends, to increase the value of their private collections. Why, then, would they care if members of the working and lower classes are unable to afford a ticket to spend an afternoon around great art? If people are serious about removing the dark money from the art market and creating an ethical art world, the first thing that should happen is to put control of the museums, which were originally created as a public good, back in the hands of the people. When the United States can\u2019t even get national healthcare, it\u2019s hard to argue for subsidized art museums and opera, but a girl can dream. Why would conservatives ever agree to raise taxes for decadent, godless artists? It\u2019s not just holdovers from the 1990s cultural wars, the younger generation in the alt-right talks a lot about how elitist and lacking in meaning the contemporary art world is. Part of that hostility, I think, and I am speaking from personal experience as someone raised in rural Kansas by parents who thought things like art and novels were a waste of time, is the feeling of high art not being for us. Of feeling belittled and excluded by the art world, because, basically, we \u2013 the working class, the rural, the Red Staters \u2013 are. Rebuilding the idea that art is for everyone, to create and to enjoy and to learn about, starts with access. Open your doors to the uncultured and the unwashed! Talk about the value of art in a language other than money! Allow someone other than the pampered children of hedge fund managers to write and speak about art! Nationalize the art museums! We have to start somewhere. Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast",

The North Carolina-based activist, thrust on to the national stage after the success of the Moral Mondays protests in his home state, joined a group of local demonstrators in St James parish, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, on Wednesday as they rallied against a proposed plastics manufacturing facility nearby.

Barber last visited the region in July as part of a series of Guardian co-sponsored town hall events in New Orleans and Reserve, which is the focus of a year-long series, Cancer Town. Reserve, in neighbouring St John the Baptist parish, has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity anywhere in the US, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary cause of this elevated risk is emissions from a synthetic rubber plant, the Pontchartrain Works facility, operated by the Japanese chemicals giant Denka. The plant is the only place in America to emit the compound chloroprene, listed by the EPA as a \u201clikely carcinogen\u201d.

On Wednesday, Barber said he had been in contact with a number of the leading Democratic candidates, including Warren and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, renewing his call for them to visit polluted sites in southern Louisiana.

Until recently, she continued to be backed by the party, but Vincenzo Spadafora, M5S\u2019s minister of sport, admitted this week the administration of Rome had been \u201cdifficult\u201d and that the whole party should take responsibility. Barbara Lezzi, an M5S senator, defended Raggi, arguing that she had \u201cinherited the destruction that all other parties had committed over the course of decades\u201d. Neither Raggi or her spokesperson were available for comment.",

A succession of dramatic \u2013 and in several cases unforeseen \u2013 social explosions have catapulted the region into the global consciousness and left some asking if a Latin American spring has arrived.

In an enormous and disparate region of 33 countries, more than 630 million people and governments from authoritarian left to far right, there is no single explanation for the political and social tremors currently rattling the region, from Quito to Caracas. But longtime observers do see some common threads linking many of the convulsions. Michael Reid, the author of Forgotten Continent: The Battle for Latin America\u2019s Soul, saw three key catalysts: the economic discontent of an emerging middle class, fury over political roguery, and the influence of other global protest movements shaking cities from Paris and Barcelona to Hong Kong. Six years of economic stagnation had brought an abrupt end to a commodity-fuelled 12-year period of growth and optimism during which poverty and inequality were reduced across Latin America. Reid said: \u201cInequalities that were tolerable when there was a sense of opportunity and that the future was going to be better become less tolerable now \u2013 and you are seeing outbreaks of frustration when people feel that their wages are not going to go up or their children are not going to be better off than they are.\u201d A second stimulus was public rage against Latin America\u2019s political machine after a wave of corruption scandals that have discredited traditional political elites, sparked furious protests in countries including Peru and Haiti, and propelled a new generation of populists to power in Brazil and Mexico. Finally, Reid believed there was a \u201ccopycat element\u201d at play as radical protesters in Ecuador and Chile were inspired by social media images of France\u2019s gilets jaunes and Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cfrontliners\u201d.

That seems to have been the case in Ecuador, where demonstrators flooded the streets this month after President Len\u00edn Moreno scrapped longstanding fuel subsidies as part of a deal with the IMF. \u201cWe can\u2019t make ends meet,\u201d complained Carmen Jaque, 50, a street vendor who was among thousands who marched on the capital.

Mo Robinson, 25, a self-employed haulier from County Armagh, was detained after the bodies of 31 men and eight women were discovered in the vehicle on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday. On Thursday, magistrates in Basildon granted officers a warrant to hold him in custody for an additional 24 hours. Local sources said his parents, who live in the village of Laurelvale, made the trip to visit their son at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. A neighbour told the Belfast Telegraph they had gone to England to see him. Three properties in Northern Ireland \u2013 Robinson\u2019s home, a nearby property he used to share with his parents, and a third site in Armagh \u2013 were raided overnight. Computers were taken away as part of the investigation, sources said. On Thursday morning it was confirmed that the 39 people found in the lorry were all Chinese. Police said they would soon start the process of moving the bodies from the lorry to a mortuary. The bodies will be taken by private ambulance under police escort from Tilbury Docks to Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, where postmortems will be carried out. The process was to begin on Thursday afternoon and it was hoped all the bodies would be removed from the lorry by the weekend, a police spokesman said. The home secretary, Priti Patel, met officers from the Essex force to be updated on the investigation, and local dignitaries and police gathered to open a book of condolence. Essex\u2019s deputy chief constable, Pippa Mills, said: \u201cThis is an incredibly sensitive and high-profile investigation, and we are working swiftly to gather as full a picture as possible as to how these people lost their lives. \u201cOur recovery of the bodies is ongoing and the postmortem and identification processes, which will be lengthy and complex, can then begin.\u201d",

Almost two decades later, the conceit has been given a tech upgrade with an app that, once downloaded, will tell the user how long they have to live. After nurse Quinn (You\u2019s Elizabeth Lail) is met with a patient who warns her of the app\u2019s IRL consequences, she irrationally decides to download it, only to be informed that she has just three days left. Initially ignoring the app as a nasty prank, she\u2019s soon plagued with visions, and starts to realise that the clock really is ticking.</p> <p>As dim on screen as it sounds on paper, Countdown is a wildly ineffective waste of a release date, a film out six days before Halloween yet likely to be forgotten within six hours. Given the endless influx of sub-par wide-releasing horror films, expectations should never be too high for one that might prove at least mildly entertaining, but there\u2019s really no excuse for them to be this bad. Combining elements of Final Destination with Ring, Countdown manages to inelegantly avoid everything about those two films that made them so successful. One of the many terrifying elements of Final Destination was the decision not to personify death (an early iteration of the script actually did turn the grim reaper into a visible character). There was something so chilling about an unseen force constructing inescapable scenarios for those whose numbers were up, and the film revelled in making them as surprising and sadistic as possible. In Countdown, we get a cloaked demon so shoddily brought to life he\u2019d be laughed out of a Halloween party, and with the film\u2019s PG-13 rating, death is quick, merciful and awkwardly edited to appease the censors.</p> <p>While Ring sent its heroine on a compelling journey to find out the source of the film\u2019s terror, with a plot that worked independently as a mystery, Countdown pairs Lail with Riverdale\u2019s Jordan Calloway and lumbers them with an uninvolving and incoherent scramble from a phone repair shop all the way to a church. The specifics of the plot aren\u2019t that specific, and the film isn\u2019t able to back up its diverting premise with much of an explanation, although in trying to do so, by going back through history, there is some unintentional hilarity (at one point, someone says \u201cThis app seems like a new version of what that old gypsy lady did!\u201d).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6O4iy3Twwo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S6O4iy3Twwo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a brief 90 minutes \u2013 but even that requires writer-director Justin Dec to pad the film out. The majority of characters who download the app are informed they have years to live, and so the film\u2019s pool of victims is miniscule, and therefore death scenes are few and far between. To fill time, Dec decides to employ a misjudged #MeToo subplot involving a doctor at the hospital where Lail\u2019s character works, played with extra ham by Peter Facinelli. Regrettably, the setting also finds space for an underused Tichina Arnold, so great in little-seen TV comedy Survivor\u2019s Remorse and briefly this year in The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Lail is a cog within an engine and her character bears no characteristics other than \u201cnurse\u201d, while Calloway does manage to inject some charm into yet another thankless role.</p> <p>Even on its own very, very basic terms, there are just too many scenes where characters act with utterly illogical idiocy, especially in the final act. Rather than screaming for them to go the other way, you\u2019ll be urging them to accept fate and die instead.</p> <ul> <li><p>Countdown is out in the UK and US on 25 October</p></li> </ul>",

Combining elements of Final Destination with Ring, Countdown manages to inelegantly avoid everything about those two films that made them so successful. One of the many terrifying elements of Final Destination was the decision not to personify death (an early iteration of the script actually did turn the grim reaper into a visible character). There was something so chilling about an unseen force constructing inescapable scenarios for those whose numbers were up, and the film revelled in making them as surprising and sadistic as possible. In Countdown, we get a cloaked demon so shoddily brought to life he\u2019d be laughed out of a Halloween party, and with the film\u2019s PG-13 rating, death is quick, merciful and awkwardly edited to appease the censors. While Ring sent its heroine on a compelling journey to find out the source of the film\u2019s terror, with a plot that worked independently as a mystery, Countdown pairs Lail with Riverdale\u2019s Jordan Calloway and lumbers them with an uninvolving and incoherent scramble from a phone repair shop all the way to a church. The specifics of the plot aren\u2019t that specific, and the film isn\u2019t able to back up its diverting premise with much of an explanation, although in trying to do so, by going back through history, there is some unintentional hilarity (at one point, someone says \u201cThis app seems like a new version of what that old gypsy lady did!\u201d). It\u2019s a brief 90 minutes \u2013 but even that requires writer-director Justin Dec to pad the film out. The majority of characters who download the app are informed they have years to live, and so the film\u2019s pool of victims is miniscule, and therefore death scenes are few and far between. To fill time, Dec decides to employ a misjudged #MeToo subplot involving a doctor at the hospital where Lail\u2019s character works, played with extra ham by Peter Facinelli. Regrettably, the setting also finds space for an underused Tichina Arnold, so great in little-seen TV comedy Survivor\u2019s Remorse and briefly this year in The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Lail is a cog within an engine and her character bears no characteristics other than \u201cnurse\u201d, while Calloway does manage to inject some charm into yet another thankless role. Even on its own very, very basic terms, there are just too many scenes where characters act with utterly illogical idiocy, especially in the final act. Rather than screaming for them to go the other way, you\u2019ll be urging them to accept fate and die instead. Countdown is out in the UK and US on 25 October",

      "body": "<p>Will it all just end up going away for Prince Andrew? You\u2019d be mad to rule it out. On Monday night, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches\" title=\"\">Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches</a> broadcast a programme that aired claims by Virginia Roberts Giuffre \u2013 who alleges she was kept as Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex slave while a minor and beyond \u2013 that she had been required to have sex with Epstein\u2019s friend Andrew three times. Once was in London, she alleged, shortly after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/06/jeffrey-epstein-virginia-roberts-giuffre-prince-andrew-photo\" title=\"\">infamous picture</a> was taken of Andrew with his arm round the waist of the 17-year-old Roberts Giuffre. Once was in New York, she also claimed, and once was in an orgy with other young women on the billionaire financier\u2019s private Virgin Islands property, reportedly known locally as \u201cPaedophile Island\u201d.</p> <p>Prince Andrew absolutely denies all these accusations, which were struck from Florida court records in 2015, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/18/prince-andrew-appalled-by-epstein-sex-abuse-claims\" title=\"\">recently said</a> he was \u201cappalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes\u201d. Even though he continued to be friends with Epstein after the latter had served more than a year in prison for procuring an underage girl for prostitution. Only a discredited plea deal prevented multiple further accusers, whose existence was publicly known, from being part of the case.</p> <p>So, yes, Dispatches was Monday night. On Tuesday, the Duke of York was unusually <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1194264/princess-beatrice-news-royal-latest-engagement-wedding-sarah-ferguson-prince-andrew\" title=\"\">accompanied on a formal engagement by his eldest daughter Beatrice</a>, who is not a working member of the royal family, having a separate career. She is to be married next year, as her sister Princess Eugenie was last October. The taxpayer dropped a couple of million on security for the latter event at Windsor, with the local council stumping up a further undisclosed sum for services such as stewarding and parking facilities. Eugenie\u2019s wedding was televised on ITV, although it remains to be seen whether the family will decide that it\u2019s worth going down that route again. Perhaps it depends where the whole investigation-into-Andrew\u2019s-dead-underage-sex-trafficker-friend thing is at that particular moment.</p> <p>Either way, there is some speculation that her father feels the need of the protective charm of family members at this time. Certainly, anonymous friends have been working hard on his behalf for a couple of months. These friends began by addressing the aforementioned photo of Andrew with Roberts Giuffre, his hand resting on the teenager\u2019s bare hip as the duke and Epstein\u2019s mutual friend Ghislaine Maxwell smile away. According to these \u201csources close to the duke\u201d, the picture may be a fake, because Prince Andrew has \u201cmuch chubbier\u201d fingers.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve never heard such rubbish, you will likely boggle even more at the close sources\u2019 more recent tack. Namely, that Andrew only flew to stay with Epstein in New York in 2010 in order to tell him they could no longer be friends. This was the same trip that took place after Epstein had been released from an 18-month jail sentence. This was the same trip where he and Andrew were photographed strolling and chatting together in Central Park, and where Andrew was photographed and filmed grinningly answering the door of Epstein\u2019s mansion to a young woman. Was this the same trip where literary agent John Brockman reported being in the same room as Andrew and Epstein as they received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/22/prince-andrew-epstein-foot-massage\" title=\"\">simultaneous foot massages</a> from two young, attractive Russian women? It\u2019s not clear. Even without that, though, you have to think it\u2019s EXACTLY how you too would end a friendship with a Tier-1 sex offender who you knew had recently got out of jail.</p> <p>Then again, for all the radioactive horror of the Epstein story, the bizarre reality is that Andrew barely needs to bother coming up with weird or absurd explanations that keep making it worse. Because, once more, people are looking in quite another direction. Despite airing a full 24 hours later, the Dispatches details were almost entirely drowned in the continuing tide of media coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/20/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-warned-tabloids-destroy-my-life\" title=\"\">the documentary</a> the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had participated in the night previously, in which they spoke of their struggle to deal with their media coverage.</p> <p>Given the sheer volume of stuff already punditted about this, I won\u2019t add much to the pile. Personally, I\u2019d resign from being sixth in line to the throne or whatever Harry is, and do one to Hollywood, where Meghan can be the biggest movie star in the world for her 40s, and he can be wheeled shyly out at her premieres, like Hugh Grant at the end of Notting Hill. But I\u2019m willing to accept it might be more complicated than that.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, we should be more interested in what happened to the courage, moral and otherwise, of those who continue to regard the decor of their baby\u2019s nursery or whatever as a bigger story than persistent allegations of Andrew\u2019s relationship with Epstein, which has been very far from satisfactorily resolved.</p> <p>Alas, there does come a point where we have to consider what kind of hive mind reckons the one story is so much more worthwhile than the other, despite the obvious misery of Harry and Meghan and the enduring misery of the likes of Roberts Giuffre. As part of this column\u2019s tireless \u2013 tireless! \u2013 commitment to public service journalism, this feels like the time to psychologically profile the most dedicated and virulent Meghan-haters, who somehow haven\u2019t a word to say about Prince Andrew\u2019s extensive links to a massive, raging, paedophile sex-case. To wit: GUYS, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? DON\u2019T LOOK THERE! LOOK OVER HERE INSTEAD!</p> <p>Listen, no one\u2019s saying that you\u2019re a paedo if you have spent at least 30 times more broadcast energy/column inches on condemning Meghan for such things as etiquette infractions in the royal box at Wimbledon than you have on Prince Andrew being repeatedly linked to a huge international underage sex-trafficking scandal involving his deceased close friend Jeffrey Epstein (denied, as above).</p> <p>Or wait \u2013 am I saying that? Of course not! Well, pretty sure. But seriously: if that\u2019s you, you DO have a problem. And you DO have to go on a kind of register that I am compiling, with the working title \u201cThe Meghan Offenders Register\u201d. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll sign it for you. At present, you don\u2019t have to go door-to-door in your neighbourhood and tell people who you are. Namely, a person who has tipped all over a new mother for relatively minuscule things, while not really thinking Prince Andrew being accused of being embroiled in something so much bigger is worth your time/word count.</p> <p>As I say: at present, you don\u2019t have to go house-to-house. Ultimately, though, we kind of know what you are. And that thing is pretty hideous. Something has gone very badly wrong. And listen, I\u2019m a liberal. If it were up to me, society would set aside a lot more money for research into how people like you get to be people like you. You could then be helped via state-of-the-art treatment programmes, because, in a lot of ways, it is a mental deficiency. Unfortunately, people are so grossed out and incensed by how you are that they don\u2019t want to rationally deal with the problem, put money into it and begin the difficult work of trying to fix you for the greater good. So, yeah, it\u2019s a cycle. Others will offend because of you.</p> <p>In conclusion, then, what follows can only be a cut-price care plan. But here goes: every time you hear Virginia Roberts Giuffre, now a mother of three herself, telling her story, but decide there\u2019s something about it that makes her not worth listening to \u2026 please try to chemically castrate those thoughts. Please don\u2019t act on your perverse urges to attack Meghan and Harry instead for things that just aren\u2019t that big of a deal. And once more, please, in the name of basic decency: DON\u2019T LOOK THERE! LOOK OVER HERE INSTEAD!</p>",

Hector Bellerin, Kieran Tierney and, whisper it, maybe even the lesser-spotted Mesut \u00d6zil could all feature.

      "bodyText": "BIG VASE IS BACK, BABY! \u201cWe are playing for our supporters and my message is \u2026\u201d Unai Emery went on the offensive ahead of his Arsenal side\u2019s Big Vase meeting with Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es this evening. Stung by criticism after the defeat at Sheffield United on Monday, frustrated by the whispers of dressing-room acrimony, the Gunners manager reached deep into his bag of oratory and pulled out a line or two to get the hairs standing up on the backs of supporters\u2019 necks. \u201cMy message is that we are going to carry on with patience!\u201d he roared as the flash bulbs dimmed and the ticker tape noticeably failed to fall. As battle cries go, it was more Leroy Jenkins than Henry V but Emery could be forgiven for feeling a bit narked \u2013 the defeat at Overlapping Centre-Backs FC was, after all, only their second of the season. The bugbear for fans as much as anything seems to be the fact that the result was exactly the sort you\u2019d have expected in the later Ars\u00e8ne Wenger years, and if you\u2019re going to have the results of the later Ars\u00e8ne Wenger years then you might as well have an affable and eloquent Frenchman with a bucket of trophies around to soften the blow. Things at least shouldn\u2019t get any worse for Emery this evening \u2013 Vit\u00f3ria have played two, lost two in Big Vase thus far and Emery\u2019s team tinkering is likely to see him naming an XI closer to the one fans have been pining for in the league. Hector Bellerin, Kieran Tierney and, whisper it, maybe even the lesser-spotted Mesut \u00d6zil could all feature. Vit\u00f3ria, for their part, could well name former Spurs youngster Marcus Edwards, Wolves loanee Leo Bonatini and ex-Liverpool midfielder Jo\u00e3o Teixeira in their side. Elsewhere in Big Vase, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s Manchester United head to Belgrade for a rerun of the 1965-66 European Cup semi-final. Partizan won on that occasion, despite Nobby Stiles\u2019s winner in the second leg, and they won\u2019t be pushovers this evening (\u201cThey\u2019re a team with some pace, a big strong striker and two or three very exciting players,\u201d says Solskj\u00e6r). Wolves also take on eastern European opposition, their game against Slovan Bratislava the 5,323rd of their season so far. And the Old Firm duo have perhaps the glamour ties of the day \u2013 Celtic welcome Simone Inzaghi\u2019s Lazio to Parkhead while Rangers\u2019 trip to Porto pits Alfredo Morelos against Pepe in the Batalha dos Fus\u00edveis Curtos. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Daniel Harris and Ben Fisher for piping-hot Big Vase clockwatch action of Celtic 0-2 Lazio, Arsenal 2-1 Vitoria de Guimaraes, Porto 1-0 Rangers, Slovan Bratislava 0-1 Wolves and Partizan Belgrade 1-1 Manchester United. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe are not having a coach discussion and are happy to have Lucien Favre. These rumours around Mourinho lack any substance\u201d \u2013 Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc responds to some managerial speculation. Also from the BVB back catalogue: 2 December 2017 Zorc: \u201dWe didn\u2019t contact any other coach. We want to achieve the turnaround with Peter Bosz.\u201d 10 December 2017 Dortmund sack Peter Bosz and appoint Peter St\u00f6ger. April 2018 Zorc: \u201dWe have always said that a longer collaboration with Peter is possible.\u201d May 2018 St\u00f6ger leaves Dortmund.

However, her commitment to the radicalism of The Wednesday Play and Play for Today was more questionable. While lauding the work of Parker, David Mercer and Clive Exton, she was less supportive of those writing politically charged dramas. Ironically, Edna, the Inebriate Woman (1971), Jeremy Sandford\u2019s tale of a down-and-out played by Patricia Hayes \u2013 the most celebrated Play for Today production commissioned by Shubik and winner of two Society of Film and Television Arts awards \u2013 was one that Shubik herself expended much space on criticising in her 1975 book, Play for Today: The Evolution of Television Drama. Sandford rebutted claims she made about the factual accuracy of both that and his classic 1966 play about homelessness, Cathy Come Home. He added that she had seemed to \u201csabotage\u201d the potential of Edna, the Inebriate Woman to have a similar impact on politicians and the public. After launching Rumpole of the Bailey on ITV, Shubik concentrated on historical drama. Her suggestion to the channel that it should turn Paul Scott\u2019s The Raj Quartet into a series was met with the idea of trying out his later work, Staying On, as a pilot. Julian Mitchell\u2019s adaptation, produced by Granada Television and screened as a single play in 1980, starred Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson in a moving portrait of old age and those colonials who had no wish to return to Britain after Indian independence. Shubik then returned to The Raj Quartet to devise The Jewel in the Crown (1984), working on scripts with the writer, Ken Taylor, and researching locations for this 13-part high point of television drama that was put on a pedestal alongside Granada\u2019s earlier production of Brideshead Revisited. Shubik was born in London, the daughter of Jewish immigrants, Sara (nee Soloveychik), from France, and Joseph Shubik, who came from Russia and traded in the flax market. Shortly after the outbreak of the second world war, she was evacuated to Canada, to live with relatives. On her return, Shubik gained a master\u2019s degree in English literature from University College London and, after being turned down by the BBC, emigrated to the US and began her career as a documentary scriptwriter for Encyclopaedia Britannica Films in New York. In 1960, after returning to Britain, she was appointed a story editor on the ITV drama series Armchair Theatre \u2013 and told by Sydney Newman, the Canadian-born producer, that he did not want any \u201ccostume crap\u201d.

Before switching to ITV, she worked on the BBC2 anthology series Playhouse (1973-76). Her commissions included half a dozen original dramas about the paranormal from writers such as Brian Hayles and Trevor. She left Granada before The Jewel in the Crown went into production because she was asked by Columbia Pictures to work on the screenplay of the film The Girl in a Swing (1988), based on Richard Adams\u2019s novel.

      "body": "<h2>20. It\u2019s in Our Hands (2002)</h2> \n<p>An overlooked gem, tacked on to the end of her fan-selected Greatest Hits collection, It\u2019s in Our Hands is a sublime slice of future R&amp;B conjured up in collaboration with the avant-techno duo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/14/matmos-review\" title=\"\">Matmos</a>. There is a particularly spicy and formidable version included on the Vespertine Live album.</p> \n<h2>19. Quicksand (2015)</h2> \n<p>Vulnicura at its most agitated; the arrangement would be beautiful if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it is allied to sudden sampled vocal interjections and a furious barrage of post-drum\u2019n\u2019bass rhythms that seem to stop, start and shift randomly. Bj\u00f6rk sounds as if she is barely keeping her emotions under control. Tough but powerful listening.</p> \n<h2>18. Triumph of a Heart (2005)</h2> \n<p>The perfect example of Medulla\u2019s ability to conjure up magic from unlikely ingredients, Triumph of a Heart is built around a cacophony of rhythmic voices, recalling human beatboxing and the vocal representations of Indian percussion on <a href=\"https://realworldrecords.com/artists/sheila-chandra/\" title=\"\">Sheila Chandra</a>\u2019s Speaking in Tongues. It gradually builds momentum until it sounds unstoppable; the melody, meanwhile, is gleeful.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f9d842b5e228e255f36443a5e434abddcf4cc1c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9d842b5e228e255f36443a5e434abddcf4cc1c/39_85_3544_4428/800.jpg\" alt=\"Already electrifying \u2026 Bj\u00f6rk in 1995.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Already electrifying \u2026 Bj\u00f6rk in 1995.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>17. Play Dead (1993)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s first two albums often feel like scrapbooks of musical ideas floating around the non-Britpop 90s: house, trip-hop, the Chemical Brothers\u2019 distorted breaks, Aphex-y electronica. Co-written with the Bond composer David Arnold and Jah Wobble, Play Dead keys into the era\u2019s revival of interest in soundtracks and easy listening, but never sounds like a pastiche: the song is too dramatic and powerful.</p> \n<h2>16. Army of Me (1995)</h2> \n<p>The opening track of Post was, apparently, the sound of Bj\u00f6rk telling her brother to buck his ideas up. But Army of Me also works as a ferocious statement of individual artistic intent (\u201cSelf-sufficiency, please! / And get to work\u201d) bedecked with John Bonham drums and dirty synthesiser. Either way, it sounds electrifying.</p> \n<h2>15. Earth Intruders (2007)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk has always had great taste when it comes to collaborators \u2013 never more so than on Earth Intruders, which pitches the hip-hop auteur Timbaland against the Congolese \u201call-powerful likembe orchestra\u201d <a href=\"http://www.crammed.be/index.php?id=34&amp;art_id=77\" title=\"\">Konono No 1</a> to startling effect. It is a fizzing, electrifying blast of beats and distorted thumb-piano that embodies the lyrics: \u201cmetallic carnage ferocity\u201d.</p> \n<h2>14. Venus As a Boy (1993)</h2> \n<p>Apparently Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s most-covered song \u2013 something like 30 different versions exist \u2013 Venus As a Boy sounds utterly lovestruck: \u201cHis wicked sense of humour / Suggests exciting sex\u201d. Its infectiously giddy mood is potentiated by the sound of an Indian orchestra, recorded in Mumbai by Talvin Singh.</p> \n<h2>13. Pagan Poetry (2001)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s original concept for Vespertine involved having \u201cicy\u201d-sounding musical boxes specially made. You can hear the results fluttering alongside a harp on Pagan Poetry, a track that starts out being serene and chilled, and gradually works up a striking erotic charge as it goes. The moment when everything dies away except Bj\u00f6rk singing \u201cI love him\u201d is among the most powerful in her catalogue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bda4c8dd74609e953d60595d89620e6cbbacbd5d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bda4c8dd74609e953d60595d89620e6cbbacbd5d/6_210_1420_1775/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Oscars dress that everyone remembers \u2026\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Oscars dress that <em>everyone</em> remembers \u2026</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>12. Arisen My Senses (2017)</h2> \n<p>On one level, Arisen My Senses sounds like chaos: crashing rhythms and overlapping voices that render the lyrics largely incomprehensible, alongside unpredictable scatterings of harp and explosions of electronics. As a musical representation of the dizziness of new love, however, it is perfect.</p> \n<h2>11. I\u2019ve Seen It All (2000)</h2> \n<p>The problem with <a href=\"https://www.heart.co.uk/showbiz/tv-movies/the-most-awkward-oscars-moments-we-cant-forget/\" title=\"\">pretending to lay an egg on the Oscars red carpet</a> is that it will overshadow the song you are there to perform: more people know about Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s swan dress than Selmasongs\u2019 centrepiece I\u2019ve Seen It All, a disturbing, dark duet with Thom Yorke. Its luscious, swirling strings are underpinned by a train-track rhythm and its eerie mood is hard to shake.</p> \n<h2>10. Cosmogony (2011)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s later albums are conceptual pieces that invariably work better as a whole: something is lost by removing individual songs from their context. That said, the sense of wonder that informs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/bjork-biophilia-cd-review\" title=\"\">Biophilia</a>\u2019s scientific explorations is perfectly summarised by Cosmogony\u2019s sighing array of electronics, brass and wordless voices, her wide-eyed vocal and its almost showtune-like chorus.</p> \n<h2>9. Stonemilker (2015)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s divorce album, Vulnicura, is frequently demanding \u2013 but rewarding \u2013 listening, the sound reflecting the raw emotions it deals with. But Stonemilker\u2019s music is at odds with its lyrical despondency: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/06/arca-new-album-alejandro-ghersi-kanye-west-bjork\" title=\"\">Arca</a>\u2019s echoing beats nestling beneath a beautiful string arrangement, with the intensity of her vocal married to an exquisite melody.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2tBhaVEWGM\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2tBhaVEWGM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  All Is Full of Love.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8. All Is Full of Love (1997)</h2> \n<p>Its <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/channels/153296\" title=\"\">Chris Cunningham</a>-directed video attracted so much attention that the song behind it occasionally gets overlooked. But All Is Full of Love is utterly beautiful without any accompanying visuals: romantic, optimistic and drowsily erotic. A perfect sliver of electronic soul.</p> \n<h2>7. Big Time Sensuality (1993)</h2> \n<p>Debut offered two opposing views of early-90s dancefloor hedonism \u2013 the self-explanatory There\u2019s More to Life Than This v Big Time Sensuality\u2019s glorious, saucer-eyed paean to ecstasy: \u201cI know I\u2019m a bit too intimate / But something huge is coming up.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRr4cjjUTpk\" title=\"\">Fluke remix</a> trumps the album version, setting her delirious growls to chugging electronics.</p> \n<h2>6. Hidden Place (2001)</h2> \n<p>It says something about Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s gradual drift away from the mainstream that Hidden Place was Vespertine\u2019s lead single. It\u2019s a world away from the simple DayGlo pleasure of It\u2019s Oh So Quiet, but it\u2019s a stunning song: tentative new love wrapped in glitchy electronics and otherworldly choral vocals.</p> \n<h2>5. Future Forever (2017)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk described her most recent album Utopia as \u201cparadise\u201d compared with the \u201chell\u201d of its predecessor, Vulnicura. Nowhere was that clearer than on the gorgeous, sparse, dreamlike drift of Future Forever, where the airy soundscape supports a movingly optimistic lyric: \u201cImagine a future and be in it \u2026 the past is a loop, turn it off.\u201d</p> \n<h2>4. Who Is It? (2004)</h2> \n<p>The lead single from Medulla, an album constructed almost entirely from vocals, hits a glorious sweet spot between experimentation and commerciality. The sound \u2013 a mass of occasionally discordant voices and beatboxing \u2013 is thrillingly alien and strange, but it resolves into a chorus that is both irresistible and pure pop.</p> \n<h2>3. Declare Independence (2008)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk isn\u2019t exactly known as a protest singer, but the distorted electronic punk of Declare Independence is a startling addition to the genre: originally inspired by Greenland and the Faroe Islands\u2019 relationship with Denmark, it is potent and nonspecific enough to apply to anything from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter to the Free Tibet movement: \u201cDon\u2019t let them do that to you!\u201d</p> \n<h2>2. J\u00f3ga (1997)</h2> \n<p>An epic demonstration of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s vocal abilities. A richly orchestrated, industrial-beat-driven examination of the intense emotions that lurk beneath close friendships, J\u00f3ga is a fabulous song that also feels remarkably ahead of the curve. The drop midway through seems to presage the rise of dubstep.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SDWFvsN2lw\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-SDWFvsN2lw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Hyperballad video\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. Hyperballad (1995)</h2> \n<p>Bj\u00f6rk has made far more experimental and adventurous music than Hyperballad, a relatively straightforward track by her later standards. But whether she has ever written a better song is a different question. Its soaring chorus is the most life-affirming moment in her back catalogue, and the arrangement, which shifts from ambient electronics to cinematic strings, is beautifully done. The point almost exactly halfway through where its stuttering rhythm is replaced by a relentless four-to-the-floor house beat is the perfect example of how a simple idea, neatly applied, can take your breath away.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "20. It\u2019s in Our Hands (2002) An overlooked gem, tacked on to the end of her fan-selected Greatest Hits collection, It\u2019s in Our Hands is a sublime slice of future R&amp;B conjured up in collaboration with the avant-techno duo Matmos. There is a particularly spicy and formidable version included on the Vespertine Live album. 19. Quicksand (2015) Vulnicura at its most agitated; the arrangement would be beautiful if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it is allied to sudden sampled vocal interjections and a furious barrage of post-drum\u2019n\u2019bass rhythms that seem to stop, start and shift randomly. Bj\u00f6rk sounds as if she is barely keeping her emotions under control. Tough but powerful listening. 18. Triumph of a Heart (2005) The perfect example of Medulla\u2019s ability to conjure up magic from unlikely ingredients, Triumph of a Heart is built around a cacophony of rhythmic voices, recalling human beatboxing and the vocal representations of Indian percussion on Sheila Chandra\u2019s Speaking in Tongues. It gradually builds momentum until it sounds unstoppable; the melody, meanwhile, is gleeful. 17. Play Dead (1993) Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s first two albums often feel like scrapbooks of musical ideas floating around the non-Britpop 90s: house, trip-hop, the Chemical Brothers\u2019 distorted breaks, Aphex-y electronica. Co-written with the Bond composer David Arnold and Jah Wobble, Play Dead keys into the era\u2019s revival of interest in soundtracks and easy listening, but never sounds like a pastiche: the song is too dramatic and powerful. 16. Army of Me (1995) The opening track of Post was, apparently, the sound of Bj\u00f6rk telling her brother to buck his ideas up. But Army of Me also works as a ferocious statement of individual artistic intent (\u201cSelf-sufficiency, please! / And get to work\u201d) bedecked with John Bonham drums and dirty synthesiser. Either way, it sounds electrifying. 15. Earth Intruders (2007) Bj\u00f6rk has always had great taste when it comes to collaborators \u2013 never more so than on Earth Intruders, which pitches the hip-hop auteur Timbaland against the Congolese \u201call-powerful likembe orchestra\u201d Konono No 1 to startling effect. It is a fizzing, electrifying blast of beats and distorted thumb-piano that embodies the lyrics: \u201cmetallic carnage ferocity\u201d. 14. Venus As a Boy (1993) Apparently Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s most-covered song \u2013 something like 30 different versions exist \u2013 Venus As a Boy sounds utterly lovestruck: \u201cHis wicked sense of humour / Suggests exciting sex\u201d. Its infectiously giddy mood is potentiated by the sound of an Indian orchestra, recorded in Mumbai by Talvin Singh. 13. Pagan Poetry (2001) Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s original concept for Vespertine involved having \u201cicy\u201d-sounding musical boxes specially made. You can hear the results fluttering alongside a harp on Pagan Poetry, a track that starts out being serene and chilled, and gradually works up a striking erotic charge as it goes. The moment when everything dies away except Bj\u00f6rk singing \u201cI love him\u201d is among the most powerful in her catalogue. 12. Arisen My Senses (2017) On one level, Arisen My Senses sounds like chaos: crashing rhythms and overlapping voices that render the lyrics largely incomprehensible, alongside unpredictable scatterings of harp and explosions of electronics. As a musical representation of the dizziness of new love, however, it is perfect. 11. I\u2019ve Seen It All (2000) The problem with pretending to lay an egg on the Oscars red carpet is that it will overshadow the song you are there to perform: more people know about Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s swan dress than Selmasongs\u2019 centrepiece I\u2019ve Seen It All, a disturbing, dark duet with Thom Yorke. Its luscious, swirling strings are underpinned by a train-track rhythm and its eerie mood is hard to shake. 10. Cosmogony (2011) Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s later albums are conceptual pieces that invariably work better as a whole: something is lost by removing individual songs from their context. That said, the sense of wonder that informs Biophilia\u2019s scientific explorations is perfectly summarised by Cosmogony\u2019s sighing array of electronics, brass and wordless voices, her wide-eyed vocal and its almost showtune-like chorus. 9. Stonemilker (2015) Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s divorce album, Vulnicura, is frequently demanding \u2013 but rewarding \u2013 listening, the sound reflecting the raw emotions it deals with. But Stonemilker\u2019s music is at odds with its lyrical despondency: Arca\u2019s echoing beats nestling beneath a beautiful string arrangement, with the intensity of her vocal married to an exquisite melody. 8. All Is Full of Love (1997) Its Chris Cunningham-directed video attracted so much attention that the song behind it occasionally gets overlooked. But All Is Full of Love is utterly beautiful without any accompanying visuals: romantic, optimistic and drowsily erotic. A perfect sliver of electronic soul. 7. Big Time Sensuality (1993) Debut offered two opposing views of early-90s dancefloor hedonism \u2013 the self-explanatory There\u2019s More to Life Than This v Big Time Sensuality\u2019s glorious, saucer-eyed paean to ecstasy: \u201cI know I\u2019m a bit too intimate / But something huge is coming up.\u201d The Fluke remix trumps the album version, setting her delirious growls to chugging electronics. 6. Hidden Place (2001) It says something about Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s gradual drift away from the mainstream that Hidden Place was Vespertine\u2019s lead single. It\u2019s a world away from the simple DayGlo pleasure of It\u2019s Oh So Quiet, but it\u2019s a stunning song: tentative new love wrapped in glitchy electronics and otherworldly choral vocals. 5. Future Forever (2017) Bj\u00f6rk described her most recent album Utopia as \u201cparadise\u201d compared with the \u201chell\u201d of its predecessor, Vulnicura. Nowhere was that clearer than on the gorgeous, sparse, dreamlike drift of Future Forever, where the airy soundscape supports a movingly optimistic lyric: \u201cImagine a future and be in it \u2026 the past is a loop, turn it off.\u201d 4. Who Is It? (2004) The lead single from Medulla, an album constructed almost entirely from vocals, hits a glorious sweet spot between experimentation and commerciality. The sound \u2013 a mass of occasionally discordant voices and beatboxing \u2013 is thrillingly alien and strange, but it resolves into a chorus that is both irresistible and pure pop. 3. Declare Independence (2008) Bj\u00f6rk isn\u2019t exactly known as a protest singer, but the distorted electronic punk of Declare Independence is a startling addition to the genre: originally inspired by Greenland and the Faroe Islands\u2019 relationship with Denmark, it is potent and nonspecific enough to apply to anything from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter to the Free Tibet movement: \u201cDon\u2019t let them do that to you!\u201d 2. J\u00f3ga (1997) An epic demonstration of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s vocal abilities. A richly orchestrated, industrial-beat-driven examination of the intense emotions that lurk beneath close friendships, J\u00f3ga is a fabulous song that also feels remarkably ahead of the curve. The drop midway through seems to presage the rise of dubstep. 1. Hyperballad (1995) Bj\u00f6rk has made far more experimental and adventurous music than Hyperballad, a relatively straightforward track by her later standards. But whether she has ever written a better song is a different question. Its soaring chorus is the most life-affirming moment in her back catalogue, and the arrangement, which shifts from ambient electronics to cinematic strings, is beautifully done. The point almost exactly halfway through where its stuttering rhythm is replaced by a relentless four-to-the-floor house beat is the perfect example of how a simple idea, neatly applied, can take your breath away.",

Done that.</p> \n<p>I witnessed a dance-in a few years back in Santiago. Dressed up like zombies in a 1980s Michael Jackson video, the student movement demanded free public education. They\u2019ve been doing so since 2006. The protests intensified in 2011, during the first Pi\u00f1era administration: 70% of the population supported their demands, widely seen as part of a general desire to transform the economic and political model established by the military dictatorship that governed the country from 1973 to 1990, after the violent coup against democratic socialist Salvador Allende.</p> \n<p>Consider Chile\u2019s privatised education system.

Such provisions became part of a constitutional framework designed by Pinochet\u2019s intellectual collaborators like Jaime Guzm\u00e1n, who was responsible for drafting most of the constitution that still governs Chile.</p> \n<p>Guzm\u00e1n was inspired by Francoist falangism and Third Reich constitutionalism, revised for a late 20th-century landscape. According to this ethos, respect for the constitution and the rule of law only goes as far \u201cas the situation permits\u201d, as the junta members put it on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/07/chile-coup-pinochet-allende\" title=\"\">11 September 1973</a>, the day of the coup. This qualification has been accepted by all post-dictatorship rulers of Chile, if not in principle at least in practice.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"16677a86-d657-4eee-a03d-00fadf4aa9c5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aKtzUSfZkQE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the dictatorship, meaningful protest and direct action were forbidden. Engaging in such acts meant risking summary execution, torture or disappearance. In the democracy, nominal rights to protest exist but remain severely limited. Social protest is frequently criminalised and direct action often equated with terrorism.</p> \n<p>Judging from the videos and testimonies circulated this week by concerned citizens and protesters, engaging in such acts still risks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/oct/22/shots-fired-at-protesters-defying-curfew-in-chile-video\" title=\"\">violent reprisals</a> from the authorities.</p> \n<p>The Pinochet regime offers us a lesson: a neoliberal model can only be established by a campaign of scapegoating and lies, underpinned by the promise to \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201crestore order and the constitution\u201d and deliver \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, plus a modicum of force. It can only be maintained if such force is normalised, shielding the model from the protests of the left-behind, which are inevitable when the dispossessed realise the game was rigged from the very outset. These were the tactics of Chile\u2019s military junta. Clearly, its actions have echoes in the present.</p> \n<p>This time, the spark that blew the powder keg came on 13 October, when the transport ministry announced the Santiago underground fare would rise by 30 pesos. Thereafter, school students began organising fare-dodging acts of protest all over the city. Thirty pesos might not sound much. And if you squint, Chile\u2019s economy isn\u2019t doing that badly: it has a GDP of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile\" title=\"\">$15,902</a> (\u00a314,155) per capita, one of the highest in Latin America.</p> \n<p>But for the many, Chile\u2019s workers and precariat, the average salary is low: only \u00a3350 per month. Commuters coming from the peripheries to work in the capital may have to spend between \u00a350 to \u00a370 a month on transport alone. Try to feed a family with what\u2019s left in a country without universal healthcare or free education. It is the same across the continent \u2013 in Quito, Buenos Aires, Bogot\u00e1, Rio. No wonder the hemisphere is exploding.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/chile-protest-war-pinera-inequality\">If Pi\u00f1era wants to wage war in Chile he should fight the real enemy: inequality | Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After the adults started joining students in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PiensaPrensa/status/1185009619292307457\" title=\"\">fare-dodging protests</a>, economics minister Juan Fontaine, very much of the free-market Chicago school, advised them to get up earlier to avoid the more expensive fares.

Guzm\u00e1n was inspired by Francoist falangism and Third Reich constitutionalism, revised for a late 20th-century landscape. According to this ethos, respect for the constitution and the rule of law only goes as far \u201cas the situation permits\u201d, as the junta members put it on 11 September 1973, the day of the coup. This qualification has been accepted by all post-dictatorship rulers of Chile, if not in principle at least in practice. In the dictatorship, meaningful protest and direct action were forbidden. Engaging in such acts meant risking summary execution, torture or disappearance. In the democracy, nominal rights to protest exist but remain severely limited. Social protest is frequently criminalised and direct action often equated with terrorism. Judging from the videos and testimonies circulated this week by concerned citizens and protesters, engaging in such acts still risks violent reprisals from the authorities. The Pinochet regime offers us a lesson: a neoliberal model can only be established by a campaign of scapegoating and lies, underpinned by the promise to \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201crestore order and the constitution\u201d and deliver \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, plus a modicum of force. It can only be maintained if such force is normalised, shielding the model from the protests of the left-behind, which are inevitable when the dispossessed realise the game was rigged from the very outset. These were the tactics of Chile\u2019s military junta. Clearly, its actions have echoes in the present. This time, the spark that blew the powder keg came on 13 October, when the transport ministry announced the Santiago underground fare would rise by 30 pesos. Thereafter, school students began organising fare-dodging acts of protest all over the city. Thirty pesos might not sound much. And if you squint, Chile\u2019s economy isn\u2019t doing that badly: it has a GDP of $15,902 (\u00a314,155) per capita, one of the highest in Latin America. But for the many, Chile\u2019s workers and precariat, the average salary is low: only \u00a3350 per month. Commuters coming from the peripheries to work in the capital may have to spend between \u00a350 to \u00a370 a month on transport alone. Try to feed a family with what\u2019s left in a country without universal healthcare or free education. It is the same across the continent \u2013 in Quito, Buenos Aires, Bogot\u00e1, Rio. No wonder the hemisphere is exploding. After the adults started joining students in fare-dodging protests, economics minister Juan Fontaine, very much of the free-market Chicago school, advised them to get up earlier to avoid the more expensive fares. His colleague, transport minister Gloria Hutt, later implied fare-dodgers were criminals. As protests raged across the city, a video of Pi\u00f1era partying at an upscale restaurant during his grandson\u2019s birthday went viral. People took to the streets. Pi\u00f1era then did what they all do \u2013 the Trumps, the Bolsonaros, the Johnsons of this world. He stamped his authority in the name of democracy, law, and the will of the people. In the country of Pinochet, Pi\u00f1era resorted to the behaviour of a dictator. The state is now behaving like security for the country\u2019s privatised industries. The crackdown is not about protecting the people. It\u2019s not about 30 pesos. It\u2019s about 30 years of an economic model elevated to the level of constitutional principle for the benefit of those who got richer during the Pinochet years, and continue to get even richer during Pi\u00f1era\u2019s \u2013 while the many suffer. They\u2019re not taking it any more. \u2022 Oscar Guardiola-Rivera is a senior lecturer in law at Birkbeck, University of London and author of What If Latin America Ruled the World?",

Thomas Orchard, 32, died after a heavy webbing belt was placed across his face while he was being restrained in Exeter following a public order incident in 2012. On Thursday, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) told the Orchard family it had reversed a decision to direct that gross misconduct hearings should take place against the two civilian officers. Earlier this year, gross misconduct hearings against four police officers \u2013 a sergeant and three constables \u2013 were discontinued after they argued there had been an abuse of process because of issues including the lapse in time since Orchard\u2019s death and concerns over the disclosure process. The detention officers, along with the sergeant, were cleared of manslaughter at Bristol crown court in 2017. Orchard\u2019s family said: \u201cWe are completely unable to comprehend how people who were charged with manslaughter can now be allowed to face absolutely no scrutiny for their work practices in relation to Thomas\u2019s death. \u201cThis decision feels outrageously and ethically wrong to our family; we have been let down by the IOPC.\u201d The family have long said achieving justice for Orchard may take many years and will now work towards an inquest. \u201cWe call upon the coroner to examine the circumstances surrounding Thomas\u2019s death publicly, openly, honestly and constructively,\u201d they said.

Since Monday of this week, the syndicate\u2019s account with Horse Racing Ireland has been frozen, meaning it cannot pay entry fees and is effectively prevented from running its horses. HRI acted after Supreme failed to provide information in response to complaints made by some of their 500 members, who pay an initial sum for a share in one of the club\u2019s 29 horses and thereafter pay a monthly fee to cover costs.

I assume he is being self-deprecating, but he assures me he is being honest. He is in London to talk about The Art of Self-Defense, a black comedy that holds toxic masculinity in its satirical crosshairs. \u201cThis one, I\u2019m sure somebody did drop out because I was offered it a week before it started.\u201d</p> <p>At 47, Nivola is in the midst of a particularly fruitful period of his career. He has been a working actor since he left Yale in the mid-90s, but the last few years have taken him to a new level. There was Selma, You Were Never Really Here and a remarkable turn in Disobedience. On television, he co-starred with Robert De Niro in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/29/bernie-madoff-scam-victims-receive-695m-from-compensation-fund\">Bernie Madoff</a> film The Wizard of Lies and played Lee Berger in Channel 4\u2019s adaptation of Chimerica.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This woman marched in and said she was there to make me a black belt in 24 hours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If, as he says, he is usually the second choice, how is that for his ego? \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a shit, really. If I think it\u2019s a great job, I\u2019m only too happy that the other idiot decided he had better things to do.\u201d</p> <p>Nivola is an excellent and effusive storyteller. In The Art of Self-Defense, Jesse Eisenberg plays Casey, a loner who is beaten up by a gang and takes refuge in a karate class run by Nivola\u2019s absurdly macho, ultra-violent Sensei. \u201cI had just put my bags down in the hotel room and there was this loud knock on my door,\u201d Nivola says, of his last-minute arrival on the project. \u201cI opened it up and this very strong woman just pushed me out of the way and marched into my room \u2013 and announced that she was there to make me a black belt in 24 hours.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Bms6Hba-3A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Bms6Hba-3A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for The Art of Self-Defense, starring Alessandro Nivola and Jesse Eisenberg</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He didn\u2019t quite become a black belt, but it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI mean, look, it was all for comic effect, the stuff that I had to do.\u201d For a long time, the audience is not quite sure who or what Sensei is. \u201cBut I felt like the more convincing I could be, the more this particular deadpan style of humour would work. You\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re supposed to laugh or be horrified or both at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>People often assume that Nivola is English. In fact, he was born and raised in Boston, US, but spent a good portion of his early career doing British films; and he is married to Emily Mortimer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s partly because I have a European name,\u201d he adds. In the early days, his agent would be asked if he could do an American accent. He gets called Alejandro a lot. \u201cEveryone assumes it\u2019s Spanish. My father-in-law [the late barrister and author John Mortimer] called me Alfonso for the first three years that I was with Emily.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat may have been intentional.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c011b143944cc38bb5b05a4f99375cb3ca3e9ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c011b143944cc38bb5b05a4f99375cb3ca3e9ae/238_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nivola as Sensei in The Art of Self-Defense.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nivola as Sensei in The Art of Self-Defense.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bleecker Street</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we meet, he has just finished shooting <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110232/\" title=\"\">The Many Saints of Newark</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/david-chase-the-sopranos-best-tv-21st-century\" title=\"\">film prequel to The Sopranos</a>, in which he plays Dickie Moltisanti, father of Christopher. In this instance, the name worked in his favour. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain that my being the son of an Italian immigrant was a big factor in being offered that role by David [Chase, creator of The Sopranos] and I know it really mattered to him.\u201d</p> <p>Nivola brings the conversation back to The Sopranos film at every turn. He loves to research a role, and The Many Saints of Newark, which begins in 1967 and moves through the early 70s, provided a banquet of opportunity. \u201cA friend\u2019s friend was a priest in Newark. He had grown up in that neighbourhood and introduced me to all kinds of people there. You know, the connection between the mob and the church is notorious,\u201d he says, laughing.</p> <p>He starts to talk about the famous Newark mob boss, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boiardo\" title=\"\">Richie \u201cThe Boot\u201d Boiardo</a>. \u201cI think Coppola may have based some of Marlon Brando\u2019s character in The Godfather on this guy,\u201d he explains. The priest took Nivola to one of the Catholic churches that had been built by Italian immigrants. \u201cHe showed me this incredible stained glass window and said, \u2018Go and look up close.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI looked and it says, \u2018Gift of Mr and Mrs Ruggiero Boiardo\u2019.\u201d He beams. \u201cThat\u2019s Richie the Boot!\u201d</p> <p>He flicks through photos on his phone. \u201cThe weirdest thing happened,\u201d he begins. \u201cThe day I got offered this job, my brother sent me this screenshot from an episode of The Sopranos where Tony is in Naples, and he\u2019s in these underground catacombs. In the back of this photo was this sculpture. And this sculpture turns out to be made by my grandfather.\u201d</p> <p>Nivola\u2019s grandfather was the sculptor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costantino_Nivola\" title=\"\">Co</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costantino_Nivola\" title=\"\">stantino Nivola</a>, and there had been a travelling exhibition of his work when The Sopranos happened to be shooting in Naples. \u201cI told David after they\u2019d offered me the job and he just couldn\u2019t believe it. He thought it was divine intervention or something.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04bdfa7c5c459d8ffedc3435f873b9c057b69b56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04bdfa7c5c459d8ffedc3435f873b9c057b69b56/1141_172_3400_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nivola with his wife, British actor Emily Mortimer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nivola with his wife, English actor Emily Mortimer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Allen/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nivola also met some real-life mobsters. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t have any dirt on anybody, but I had the opportunity to talk to somebody who introduced me to somebody else, who introduced me to somebody else and, finally, I was sitting at a table with a bunch of guys who really were living this life. Trying to determine whether these guys are imitating the movies or the movies are imitating them is such a tricky thing.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the person who made the introduction told him not to mention The Sopranos because he was worried they would start to play to type. \u201cThey just thought I was a friend of his. But if those real guys had been in a movie, you would have thought it was a send-up of a mob movie.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d026671931c6ff88bd3736b0c8172559a8adc82b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d026671931c6ff88bd3736b0c8172559a8adc82b/0_33_2609_1566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nivola as photojournalist Lee Berger in the Channel 4 drama Chimerica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nivola as photojournalist Lee Berger in the Channel 4 drama Chimerica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Playground/\u00a9 Playground</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask about James Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael, playing the young Tony Soprano, but Nivola starts to worry about how much he can say. \u201cI just don\u2019t want David to kill me,\u201d he reasons. \u201cI can maybe give you a little bit of a feel for it. Dickie was a kind of mentor figure to Tony as a young guy. I think Tony and everyone else in that neighbourhood saw this guy as a perfect man and the story of this movie really reveals otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>There are \u201cbig Greek themes running through it\u201d, and it is set against the backdrop of the late-60s race riots. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the fabric of the story, the relations between the Italian-American community and the black community in Newark at that time. The main thing is that this character is, like all of David\u2019s heroes, incredibly complex, morally complex, and just full of kind of every colour that you could imagine.\u201d He sighs happily. \u201cIt was something I could have spent years working on.\u201d</p> <p>Now he is thinking about what comes next. He is working on a film with Ethan Hawke, about the fractious relationship between the 1950s vocal duo, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/19/folk\" title=\"\">Louvin Brothers</a>. Phil Morrison, who directed Nivola in Junebug, is in line to direct. From an outside perspective, it looks as if his career is the best it has ever been. \u201cYeah,\u201d he nods, smiling. Then he turns back to The Sopranos once again. \u201cI had been feeling over these past several years that something was brewing, but I never could have guessed that whatever the thing was would be as great as that.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Art of Self-Defense is released on download on 4 November</em></p>",

If, as he says, he is usually the second choice, how is that for his ego? \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a shit, really. If I think it\u2019s a great job, I\u2019m only too happy that the other idiot decided he had better things to do.\u201d Nivola is an excellent and effusive storyteller. In The Art of Self-Defense, Jesse Eisenberg plays Casey, a loner who is beaten up by a gang and takes refuge in a karate class run by Nivola\u2019s absurdly macho, ultra-violent Sensei. \u201cI had just put my bags down in the hotel room and there was this loud knock on my door,\u201d Nivola says, of his last-minute arrival on the project. \u201cI opened it up and this very strong woman just pushed me out of the way and marched into my room \u2013 and announced that she was there to make me a black belt in 24 hours.\u201d He didn\u2019t quite become a black belt, but it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI mean, look, it was all for comic effect, the stuff that I had to do.\u201d For a long time, the audience is not quite sure who or what Sensei is. \u201cBut I felt like the more convincing I could be, the more this particular deadpan style of humour would work. You\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re supposed to laugh or be horrified or both at the same time.\u201d People often assume that Nivola is English. In fact, he was born and raised in Boston, US, but spent a good portion of his early career doing British films; and he is married to Emily Mortimer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s partly because I have a European name,\u201d he adds. In the early days, his agent would be asked if he could do an American accent. He gets called Alejandro a lot. \u201cEveryone assumes it\u2019s Spanish. My father-in-law [the late barrister and author John Mortimer] called me Alfonso for the first three years that I was with Emily.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat may have been intentional.\u201d When we meet, he has just finished shooting The Many Saints of Newark, the film prequel to The Sopranos, in which he plays Dickie Moltisanti, father of Christopher. In this instance, the name worked in his favour. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain that my being the son of an Italian immigrant was a big factor in being offered that role by David [Chase, creator of The Sopranos] and I know it really mattered to him.\u201d Nivola brings the conversation back to The Sopranos film at every turn. He loves to research a role, and The Many Saints of Newark, which begins in 1967 and moves through the early 70s, provided a banquet of opportunity. \u201cA friend\u2019s friend was a priest in Newark. He had grown up in that neighbourhood and introduced me to all kinds of people there. You know, the connection between the mob and the church is notorious,\u201d he says, laughing. He starts to talk about the famous Newark mob boss, Richie \u201cThe Boot\u201d Boiardo. \u201cI think Coppola may have based some of Marlon Brando\u2019s character in The Godfather on this guy,\u201d he explains. The priest took Nivola to one of the Catholic churches that had been built by Italian immigrants. \u201cHe showed me this incredible stained glass window and said, \u2018Go and look up close.\u2019 \u201cI looked and it says, \u2018Gift of Mr and Mrs Ruggiero Boiardo\u2019.\u201d He beams. \u201cThat\u2019s Richie the Boot!\u201d He flicks through photos on his phone. \u201cThe weirdest thing happened,\u201d he begins. \u201cThe day I got offered this job, my brother sent me this screenshot from an episode of The Sopranos where Tony is in Naples, and he\u2019s in these underground catacombs. In the back of this photo was this sculpture. And this sculpture turns out to be made by my grandfather.\u201d Nivola\u2019s grandfather was the sculptor Costantino Nivola, and there had been a travelling exhibition of his work when The Sopranos happened to be shooting in Naples. \u201cI told David after they\u2019d offered me the job and he just couldn\u2019t believe it. He thought it was divine intervention or something.\u201d Nivola also met some real-life mobsters. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t have any dirt on anybody, but I had the opportunity to talk to somebody who introduced me to somebody else, who introduced me to somebody else and, finally, I was sitting at a table with a bunch of guys who really were living this life. Trying to determine whether these guys are imitating the movies or the movies are imitating them is such a tricky thing.\u201d In fact, the person who made the introduction told him not to mention The Sopranos because he was worried they would start to play to type. \u201cThey just thought I was a friend of his. But if those real guys had been in a movie, you would have thought it was a send-up of a mob movie.\u201d I ask about James Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael, playing the young Tony Soprano, but Nivola starts to worry about how much he can say. \u201cI just don\u2019t want David to kill me,\u201d he reasons. \u201cI can maybe give you a little bit of a feel for it. Dickie was a kind of mentor figure to Tony as a young guy. I think Tony and everyone else in that neighbourhood saw this guy as a perfect man and the story of this movie really reveals otherwise.\u201d There are \u201cbig Greek themes running through it\u201d, and it is set against the backdrop of the late-60s race riots. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the fabric of the story, the relations between the Italian-American community and the black community in Newark at that time. The main thing is that this character is, like all of David\u2019s heroes, incredibly complex, morally complex, and just full of kind of every colour that you could imagine.\u201d He sighs happily. \u201cIt was something I could have spent years working on.\u201d Now he is thinking about what comes next. He is working on a film with Ethan Hawke, about the fractious relationship between the 1950s vocal duo, the Louvin Brothers. Phil Morrison, who directed Nivola in Junebug, is in line to direct. From an outside perspective, it looks as if his career is the best it has ever been. \u201cYeah,\u201d he nods, smiling. Then he turns back to The Sopranos once again. \u201cI had been feeling over these past several years that something was brewing, but I never could have guessed that whatever the thing was would be as great as that.\u201d The Art of Self-Defense is released on download on 4 November",

Seven prominent supporters of XR brought judicial review proceedings against the Metropolitan police after the force last Monday issued the order under section 14 of the Public Order Act to demand that that the group\u2019s activists \u201ccease their protest(s) within London\u201d. It was considered an attempt to curtail the group\u2019s two-week \u201cautumn uprising\u201d \u2013 a series of non-violent direct action protests in the capital \u2013 and was criticised by the civil rights groups Amnesty International UK, Article 19 and Liberty as an assault on the right to protest. If the judicial review is successful, lawyers for XR suggest that hundreds of protesters arrested under the order may have a case against the Met that their detention was unlawful. Making the case for XR on Thursday, Phillippa Kaufmann QC told Mr Justice Dingemans and Mr Justice Chamberlain they should quash the Met\u2019s use of section 14 on the basis that it went beyond the law and was framed so unclearly that it was an abuse of power.

      "bodyText": "A little before lunchtime on Thursday, a helicopter carrying a single body freshly plucked from Spain\u2019s largest mass grave took off from the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, climbed above the mountains and disappeared into the bright October sky. Unlike many of the other 33,832 people buried in the valley\u2019s concrete and granite chambers, this individual did not meet his fate on a battlefield or in an air raid. Nor was he put up against a wall and shot, as so many were during the Spanish civil war. Francisco Franco died peacefully at the age of 82 in November 1975, heralding the end of the dictatorship that bore his name and that haunts the country to this day. Forty-four years after his body was interred in the hulking mausoleum, it emerged in a coffin carried out of the basilica on the shoulders of eight of his descendants. The coffin, swathed in a cloth bearing the family crest and topped with a huge laurel wreath tied with red and yellow ribbons, was brought out through the church\u2019s heavy doors just before 1pm. As the relatives lowered it into the hearse that would take it to the waiting air force helicopter, they let out a stentorian cry: \u201c\u00a1Viva Espa\u00f1a! \u00a1Viva Franco!\u201d An hour later it arrived at the Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery north of the capital, where Franco\u2019s widow, Carmen Polo, is buried in the family mausoleum and where the dictator was reinterred in a private ceremony. Thursday was a symbolic but undeniable triumph for the socialist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose party has long argued that the site, surmounted by its 150-metre (490ft) cross, had glorified the dictator while ignoring the 500,000 people killed during the war. The dead of both sides were dug up from mass graves and cemeteries around Spain without their families\u2019 permission and brought to lie in the monument, mute witnesses reburied in their thousands to support the charade that this was a place of national reconciliation. Only two of the graves were ever marked: those of Franco and of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falangist party, who was executed by firing squad in November 1936 \u201cToday, Spain is fulfilling its duty to itself,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said on Thursday afternoon. \u201cThis decision marks an end to the moral insult that the public glorification of a dictator constitutes. We are taking another step towards the reconciliation that can only exist in the democracy and the freedom we all share.\u201d The path to the exhumation has not been easy. Opposition had come from the dictator\u2019s family, from the National Francisco Franco Foundation, which exists to preserve and promote his legacy, and from the abbot of the valley, a former election candidate for the Falange party. The Franco family\u2019s position has never altered: he was buried in the valley at the behest of the country\u2019s then prime minister and king, making the exhumation \u201can act for indefensible political ends\u201d. The family made their disdain for the entire process patently clear with a well-aimed and profoundly unsubtle parting shot. The man chosen to say mass inside the family mausoleum was an Andaluc\u00edan parish priest, Ram\u00f3n Tejero, the son of Antonio Tejero, a Guardia Civil lieutenant colonel who stormed parliament during the failed 1981 military coup. Tejero Sr made an unexpected appearance at Mingorrubio on Thursday morning, where he was greeted with rapturous chants by the 500 or so people who had turned out to show their devotion to the dictator. The S\u00e1nchez government dismissed suggestions that the timing of the exhumation, less than three weeks before Spain\u2019s fourth general election in as many years, was anything other than fortuitous. Carmen Calvo, the deputy prime minister, pointed out that the government had tried to exhume Franco over the summer but had been made to wait as his descendants and others appealed to the supreme court. She said Thursday had been the first possible day for the operation. Nonetheless, the timing has been criticised by both left and right. Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the anti-austerity Unidas-Podemos, accused S\u00e1nchez of \u201cbringing the mummy out in a helicopter\u201d for political ends after recent unrest in Catalonia. Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, opted for a more direct invocation of the dead of ancient Egypt. \u201cHe who moves the dead winds up paying for it with the curse of Tutankhamun,\u201d he warned solemnly, if cryptically. And yet for all the political pontificating and all the nostalgic fascists with their loyal banners and musty chants, for some the day had little to do with Franco. Almost four years ago a court granted Maria Purificaci\u00f3n Lape\u00f1a permission to recover the remains of her grandfather and great-uncle. Manuel Lape\u00f1a, a vet, and his brother Antonio, a blacksmith, were executed by Francoist forces in the early days of the war, buried in a mass grave and then dug up decades later and reburied in the basilica without their families\u2019 knowledge or permission. Like many others, Purificaci\u00f3n Lape\u00f1a is still dreaming of the day the Franco family dreaded. \u201cWe\u2019re not really bothered about what they do with Franco,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat matters to us is getting the bodies of our relatives back. They need to get all the other bodies out and give them back to the families where possible.\u201d When that was done, she said, the valley should be deconsecrated, the monks sent packing and the site turned into a historical education centre \u201cwhere they tell the truth about what happened with the coup and during the Spanish civil war\u201d. Rosa Gil\u2019s grandfather, Pedro, was killed fighting for Franco and now lies in the valley in a box bearing the number 6,427 and the date of his death, 1 June 1937. For the sake of her 83-year-old father, who was one year old when his father died, she wants to bring Pedro out and bury him in the village cemetery in Soria. \u201cAs a Spaniard I\u2019m glad that Franco\u2019s coming out \u2013 it\u2019s an important symbolic act for the country,\u201d said Gil. \u201cBut my grandfather is a bit more important to me personally. As long as my grandfather stays in there, the joy is tempered.\u201d About 100,000 victims of the civil war are thought to lie in the unmarked graves where they were buried during the conflict, making Spain the country with the most mass graves after Cambodia. With the helicopter, the hearse and the cameras gone and its most troublesome ghost evicted at long last, the Valley of the Fallen will soon return to its own extraordinary approximation of normality. The site and its gift shop will reopen, the school visits will resume and the bones of Manuel and Antonio Lape\u00f1a, of Pedro Gil and of tens of thousands of others will continue to lie in their boxes under a huge span of rock, concrete and time, waiting for the day when their families come to bury them for the final time.",

This might seem counterintuitive \u2013 after all, you might think that giving local areas greater powers over taxing and spending will allow richer areas with larger tax bases to benefit at the expense of others. Yet multiple reviews of the evidence suggest that countries where local areas are given more power over taxes have lower levels of regional inequality, better public services, and higher levels of productivity to boot. Our hyper-centralised country, by contrast, has some of the highest levels of <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/uk-higher-regional-inequality-large-wealthy-country-1.862262\" title=\"\">regional inequality</a> in Europe.</p> <p>Second, it holds back local government from being bold or radical. Lots of the most exciting policies to tackle climate change, or inequality, for instance, are being developed locally. Think about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/10/barcelonas-car-free-superblocks-could-save-hundreds-of-lives\" title=\"\">Barcelona\u2019s proposals for car-free superblocks</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/24/canada-basic-income-trial-ontario-summer\" title=\"\">Ontario\u2019s universal basic income trial</a>, or Seattle\u2019s (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/12/seattle-amazon-head-tax-repealed-one-month\" title=\"\">raise an \u201cAmazon tax\u201d on large employers</a>. Each of these would be impossible for a British city or region to put into practice.</p> <p>In fact, the lack of tax powers encourages cash-strapped local authorities, which have lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/02/one-in-five-councils-face-drastic-spending-cuts-within-months\" title=\"\">almost 60p in the \u00a31</a> from central government funding since the start of the decade, to pursue short-termist approaches to balancing the books, including selling off public assets and cutting services. These end up costing them, and the local population, more in the long term. If a local administration does decide to invest in cutting air pollution or increasing wages, local coffers may see little or no return on that investment because the benefits to the taxpayer (in terms of reduced hospital admissions, increased productivity or higher income-tax receipts, for instance) all flow directly to the exchequer in Whitehall.</p> <p>Finally, this state of affairs weakens our democracy. Turnout at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47666080\" title=\"\">local elections</a> is shamefully low, but can we blame people for not bothering to vote when the big decisions about public spending are all made in Westminster?</p> <p>Since the 1970s, Britain has experimented with an increasingly centralised system of government. This has demonstrably failed. We need to roll back decades of centralisation and devolve substantial powers over tax to cities and counties, just like almost every other similar nation does. It would represent a major step towards tackling Britain\u2019s huge inequalities and help empower local councils to tackle the major challenges of the 21st century.</p> <p>\u2022 Jack Hunter is a research fellow at IPPR North</p>",

This might seem counterintuitive \u2013 after all, you might think that giving local areas greater powers over taxing and spending will allow richer areas with larger tax bases to benefit at the expense of others. Yet multiple reviews of the evidence suggest that countries where local areas are given more power over taxes have lower levels of regional inequality, better public services, and higher levels of productivity to boot. Our hyper-centralised country, by contrast, has some of the highest levels of regional inequality in Europe. Second, it holds back local government from being bold or radical. Lots of the most exciting policies to tackle climate change, or inequality, for instance, are being developed locally. Think about Barcelona\u2019s proposals for car-free superblocks, or Ontario\u2019s universal basic income trial, or Seattle\u2019s (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to raise an \u201cAmazon tax\u201d on large employers. Each of these would be impossible for a British city or region to put into practice. In fact, the lack of tax powers encourages cash-strapped local authorities, which have lost almost 60p in the \u00a31 from central government funding since the start of the decade, to pursue short-termist approaches to balancing the books, including selling off public assets and cutting services. These end up costing them, and the local population, more in the long term. If a local administration does decide to invest in cutting air pollution or increasing wages, local coffers may see little or no return on that investment because the benefits to the taxpayer (in terms of reduced hospital admissions, increased productivity or higher income-tax receipts, for instance) all flow directly to the exchequer in Whitehall. Finally, this state of affairs weakens our democracy. Turnout at local elections is shamefully low, but can we blame people for not bothering to vote when the big decisions about public spending are all made in Westminster? Since the 1970s, Britain has experimented with an increasingly centralised system of government. This has demonstrably failed. We need to roll back decades of centralisation and devolve substantial powers over tax to cities and counties, just like almost every other similar nation does. It would represent a major step towards tackling Britain\u2019s huge inequalities and help empower local councils to tackle the major challenges of the 21st century. \u2022 Jack Hunter is a research fellow at IPPR North",

Begum has been able to pass instructions to her lawyers from the prison camp in Syria where she has been held since being stripped of her British citizenship. However, lawyers who are appealing against that action at the Special Immigration and Appeals Commission (Siac) in London say they have not been able to discuss the case against her in any detail. Begum\u2019s lawyer said that when the woman was deprived of her citizenship, Sajid Javid, the then home secretary, knew she had just given birth, was caring for the infant, and it was \u201cvery clear that there was a serious problem in relation to the health and wellbeing of children in the camp at that time\u201d. Conditions in the al-Hawl camp were so bad that over the course of a few nights 35 children died, earning it the nickname the \u201ccamp of death\u201d.

Tom Hickman QC, representing Begum, said deprivation of citizenship had been around since 1948, but \u201cthis is an extreme scenario\u201d. \u201cIf someone is unable to appeal in any meaningful way, it must be unlawful,\u201d he added.

But she also said that anybody who stayed fell into a different bracket. The case against Begum emphasised the circumstances in which she left and relied on the fact that she made a conscious effort to hide her travel plans from the authorities by using her sister\u2019s passport. Begum left Britain in February 2015 when she was 15, with two friends from the Bethnal Green academy in east London. The other girls are thought to have been killed in the conflict.

      "bodyText": "October in Orania can be charming. When the sun sets, long ribbons of burnt orange settle on the horizon. The flies and mosquitoes that come with the summer\u2019s oppressive heat haven\u2019t arrived yet. It is Magdalene Kleynhans\u2019 favourite time of year. \u201cYou can sit outside until late into the night,\u201d says the businesswoman, whose family spends much of their time outdoors. Her children fish from the banks of the Orange River whenever they choose. Kleynhans leaves the house unlocked. \u201cIt\u2019s a good life. It\u2019s a big privilege.\u201d But there is much more to this small Northern Cape town than the bucolic ideal painted by Kleynhans. Incredibly, 25 years after the fall of apartheid, Orania is a place for white people only. Kleynhans runs one of Orania\u2019s biggest enterprises: a call centre whose business is recruiting and retaining members for Solidariteit, a trade union primarily for Afrikaner workers, and Afriforum, a self-styled \u201ccivil rights\u201d movement. Afriforum recently met with US president Donald Trump\u2019s administration and Tucker Carlson of Fox Nows to tell them that Afrikaners are facing a widely discredited genocide. Both have made extensive investments in Orania\u2019s construction boom. Oranians claim the town is a cultural project, not a racial one. Only Afrikaners are allowed to live and work there to preserve Afrikaner culture, the argument goes. Magdalene Kleynhans owns a call centre that employs around 55 people in Orania The reality, however, is a disquieting and entirely white town, littered with old apartheid flags and monuments to the architects of segregation. While there are no rules preventing black people from visiting, those who live nearby fear they would be met with violence. The town has faced numerous calls for it to be broken up over the years, with prominent author and advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi arguing its existence violates South Africa\u2019s successful dismantling of racial segregation. \u201cOrania,\u201d he says, \u201crepresents downright hostility to the idea of a single, united, non-racial country.\u201d Large-scale eviction Orania was created in 1991, a year after Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from Robben Island, and three years before the country\u2019s first democratic election. Set among lush pecan nut orchards in the otherwise arid Karoo, it was set-up as an Afrikaner-only hamlet, not dissimilar from the ethnic Bantustans established under former prime minister, Hendrik Verwoerd, often dubbed the \u201carchitect of apartheid\u201d. Busts of former presidents of the town surround the statue of town mascot De Kleine Reus (The Little Giant), a young boy rolling up his sleeves, intended to symbolise the Oranians\u2019 belief in self reliance By the end of the 1980s, the probability of losing control had already occurred to many Afrikaners, with some believing that impending democracy posed an existential threat to the white Afrikaans way of life. A few felt protecting that required becoming a demographic majority somewhere, rather than remaining a minority everywhere. So a small group of Afrikaners \u2013 Verwoerd\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, Carel Boshoff, among them \u2013 purchased a strip of land on the southern banks of the Orange River, and went about setting up a volkstaat, or independent homeland, where Afrikaners would decide their own affairs. Orania\u2019s founders did not settle on virgin territory, but on the remains of a half-realised 1960s project to build canals and dams along the Orange River. A community of 500 poor black and mixed-race squatters who had made their homes in the buildings left behind by the project stood between the new owners and their whites-only vision. Black people are restricted to using the petrol station on the edge of Orania Speaking to the community after the purchase, Boshoff reportedly said he \u201cdid not buy a bus with passengers\u201d. What followed, according to Cambridge historian Edward Cavanagh\u2019s history of land rights on the Orange River, was one of the last large-scale evictions under apartheid. It was carried out by the future residents of Orania, with the assistance of beatings, pistol whippings and dogs. The population has doubled After three decades as a quiet backwater, Orania is booming. Its population \u2013 currently around 1,700 \u2013 has doubled over the last seven years. The most recent census estimates growth of more than 10% a year, outstripping most comparable rural towns and more, proportionally, than South Africa\u2019s biggest cities. Population growth means a flourishing housing market and construction industry.

There is an industrial zone of brick and aluminium factories which sell their products around South Africa. China buys most of the pecan nuts. The growth shows no signs of slowing. A sewage works meant to accommodate 10,000 future residents is in the pipeline. There are designs to transform the town\u2019s humble technical training facility \u2013 where many of the skills driving the town\u2019s new construction were taught \u2013 into a university.

People who want to live in Orania buy shares in the Vluytjeskraal Aandeleblok, instead of freehold. The screening of prospective shareholders allows for tight control.

Pursued and harassed A quarter of a century after the end of apartheid, black people are restricted to using the filling station on the edge of Orania. Benjamin Khumalo* is one of them. The 55-year-old and his wife, who have lived on a small nearby plot since the 1980s, were once pursued and harassed by a pickup truck covered with Orania stickers when walking home after an evening with friends. \u201cNow you must run,\u201d he urged his wife, pushing her through a fence. \u201cI\u2019ll be behind you.\u201d Khumalo still remembers when Orania was a home for black families.

Except you never have to go home.\u201d Noticeboards at a local restaurant carry a warning to European journalists. The spectre of Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, is difficult to escape. His portrait and bust seem to be around every corner. His wife, Betsie, is buried in the town, and her old home has been converted into a Verwoerd museum. His grandson Carel Boshoff junior is a former leader of the Orania Movement, which first proposed the idea of Orania in the 1980s. Boshoff junior is perhaps one of the more unlikely fans of the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, whose music plays on a laptop in his office.

Verwoerd\u2019s grandson, Carel Boshoff junior, worries white Afrikaners could be \u2018wiped out\u2019 \u201cWe are something like the phoenix in the ashes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe questions to which Orania is the answer are so fundamental to the structure of South African society that you can\u2019t express and affirm your Afrikaner identity without coming to the conclusion of a bigger Orania.\u201d Offended by Orania Orania has continued largely uncontested since its victorious appeal to the high court in the early 2000s. The ANC government does not appear to be considering an appeal of the high court decision. Zamani Saul, head of the ANC-run Northern Cape government, has said an inquiry into Orania\u2019s legal status is yet to be concluded. For Ngcukaitobi, the author, Orania \u201crepresents the reversal of the constitutional project of national building.\u201d The rights that underpinned the town\u2019s high court challenge against the remapping are not unlimited, he says. Anyone who cares about South Africa \u201cwould rightly be offended by what Orania represents, which is an enduring legacy of racial mobilisation\u201d. Orapeleng Moraladi, Northern Cape secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, blames the town\u2019s continued existence on the courts, an uncooperative Orania leadership, and a lack of political will from the ANC. \u201c[The town] is like embracing an apartheid system within a democratic state,\u201d he says. \u201cOrania is an indictment of the government of South Africa.\u201d *Indicated names have been changed Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

Two Plants took him three years to complete and it apparently drove him \u201caround the bend\u201d. As he recalled: \u201cI felt like I was composing an enormous symphony, and since I\u2019m completely unmusical, the difficulties were many. And when I took one tiny leaf and changed it, it affected all other areas of it, and so on.\u201d</p> <p>These thoughts, and a few more about how he hoped the painting would convey a \u201creally biological feeling of things growing and fading\u201d, are pretty much all Freud said about the plants in his work. The endless fascination of critics with his fleshy, abrasive-looking models kept the spotlight away from his botanical subjects. In a rare glimmer of interest, art historian Lawrence Gowing once remarked that the yucca tree Freud painted in <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/paintings/20c/item-239329.aspx\">Interior at Paddington (1951)</a> was \u201cone of the most memorable potted plants in the history of modern art\u201d \u2013 though he never said why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ca3b628f98aeafcc7ff5af0b7f815c6fdd95ebc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3b628f98aeafcc7ff5af0b7f815c6fdd95ebc9/0_0_5457_7087/770.jpg\" alt=\"Two Plants, 1977-80, by Lucian Freud.\" width=\"770\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Plants, 1977-80, by Lucian Freud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freud\u2019s roughly 100 paintings, etchings and drawings of plants remain conspicuously overlooked. And that has nothing to do with the quality of the art \u2013 from the linear minimalism of early works on paper and the meticulous realism of his mid-career paintings to the near-expressionist verve of the last few canvases of his Notting Hill garden, Freud captured the elusive essence of plants like no other. So why are these paintings rarely exhibited and discussed?</p> <p>The fraught relationship with plants in art is rooted in the past. Scholars of 16th-century Italian academies were the first to rank subjects in art. A hundred years later, Andre\u0301 Fe\u0301libien, court historian to Louis XIV, set the rule in stone when he declared: \u201cHe who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and since man is the most perfect work of God on the Earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others.\u201d</p> <p>Fe\u0301libien\u2019s words profoundly changed the course of western painting. At the time, the study of the nude, essential to the training for history and religious painting, was forbidden to aspiring female artists. This enormously limited their creative potential and systematically excluded them from the making of what, back then, went by the name of great art.</p> <p>Faced with not being able to enter prestigious competitions such as the Prix de Rome, or win important scholarships, women turned to the \u201clower\u201d ranks of art. Despite the highly specialised skill that painting plants required, images of flowers and fruits were more affordable and appealed to the newly wealthy mercantile class. Our inability to take paintings of plants seriously owes much to this patriarchal thread entangled in gender and social biases.</p> <p>Luckily, the best modern artists knew how to disrespect classical rules. From impressionism and surrealism to pop art, plants have quietly been at the forefront of the most important artistic revolutions. Indeed, the root of the problem has been with the writers of art, who have unwittingly subscribed to the old rules. So, while paintings of plants are not necessarily rare in modern and contemporary art, their importance has been grossly diminished by critics, curators, and art historians. And they are not alone. The history of art has not been the only discipline to marginalise the natural world. Across literature, philosophy, theatre and more, defining our humanity through the arts has come at the cost of pushing plants and animals to the side. For centuries we have posed as sole protagonists on the historical stage and when, through art, we have turned to plants, all we could ever see was ourselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ba4a03804a17c842060e3ae13a99e5f2391cbdda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba4a03804a17c842060e3ae13a99e5f2391cbdda/0_0_5349_7087/755.jpg\" alt=\"Interior at Paddington, 1951.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One of the most memorable potted plants in the history of modern art\u2019 \u2026 Interior at Paddington, 1951.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Art institutions are now rushing to acknowledge the threat of the climate crisis, but in truth, the writing has been on the wall \u2013 or shall we say on the canvas \u2013 for the past 500 years. Our lack of regard for plants and animals in art is indicative of our lack of appreciation for nature itself. The current climate emergency is surely linked to this longstanding cultural attitude.</p> <p>The other problem with plants and western art is symbolism. During the Renaissance, plants were turned into the trustworthy keyholders of visual narratives. Leaves and petals anchored essential virtues and admonished the faithful to fear the perils of evil. So, cherries, red carnations and poppies evoked blood in Christ\u2019s passion, and the whiteness of citrus blossoms, lilies and jasmine incarnated the purity of the Virgin. Thereafter, the overindulgent flower compositions of the Dutch golden age added to the glossary, as did the hyper-detailed paintings of the pre-Raphaelites, who fondly drew from the wave of floriography, the interest for the language of flowers that swept Victorian England. Seeing symbols wherever flowers bloom is undeniably poetic, but symbolism replaces one thing for another and invites us to see ourselves in the subject rather than see the subject itself.</p> <p>Van Gogh, Monet and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/01/georgia-okeeffe-tate-modern-exhibition-wild-beauty\">Georgia O\u2019Keeffe</a> have painted flowers that bypassed obvious symbolic meanings. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/17/how-van-gogh-sunflowers-bloom\">Van Gogh\u2019s sunflowers</a> and other floral subjects are revolutionary only on the surface. Beneath the thick brushwork, their roots are firmly planted in the tradition of Dutch still-life painting \u2013 they are simply beautiful, albeit modern, reminders of death. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/03/mad-enchantment-claude-monet-water-lilies-review\">Monet\u2019s waterlilies</a> are transfigured landscapes of spiritual longing in which the artist\u2019s obsession with reflections on water and atmospheric effects could be explored to the full. And O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s explicit closeups of flowers are far too carnal to be truly vegetal.</p> <p>In contrast, the originality of Freud\u2019s paintings of plants is directly linked to his rejection of classical symbolism \u2013 he knew how it could blind us. Unabashedly stripping off symbolic layers, Freud uncovered a raw essence so it could rise to the surface of his canvases in the most unforgiving and unnerving of ways. This quality pervades his nudes and portraits of plants in equal measure. Both are laid bare in the truth of their existence, voided of messages and meaning they cannot naturally own.</p> <p>Freud wasn\u2019t interested in idealisation, either; he composed or synthesised but never attempted to lift his subject out of life\u2019s gutter. As a result, his painted plants couldn\u2019t be more distant from the tradition of still-life painting. Not for him the exotic cultivars or the baroque pyrotechnics of the Dutch golden age: Freud preferred weeds and straggly potted plants \u2013 ones he encountered and lived with. Every single portrait of a plant he made feels like a slap in the face to still-life painting and botanical illustration. Freud\u2019s plants are irremediably engulfed in their laconic character and imperturbable demeanour.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is at risk of losing a generation of younger viewers who have drifted away to services such as Netflix and YouTube, potentially putting the future of the licence fee at risk, according to the media regulator. Ofcom said the corporation must do much more to make the case that the BBC is worth supporting to audiences who have grown up with YouTube as their main source of video and who now instinctively turn to social media channels for news. Among the stark findings laying out the challenges for the BBC were that: Fewer than half of Britons aged between 16 and 24 watch a traditional live BBC television channel in the average week. Younger viewers are twice as likely to watch BBC programmes on Netflix than on the BBC\u2019s own iPlayer service, suggesting they may not know that popular shows such as Doctor Who and Peaky Blinders were created using licence fee money. Children in their early teens are more likely to recognise the YouTube and Netflix brands than the BBC. Younger listeners are twice as likely to listen to commercial radio rather than the BBC\u2019s stations. The regulator also concluded that the reputation of the BBC\u2019s news output had come under attack during the Brexit debate, partly because the corporation has always tried to ensure \u201cboth sides\u201d of a debate are heard. Ofcom said this could be problematic and urged the corporation\u2019s journalists to be more willing to directly call out lies and fringe views rather than allow them to go unchallenged in the name of balance. \u201cBBC journalists should feel able to challenge controversial viewpoints that have little support or are not backed up by facts, making this clear to viewers, listeners and readers,\u201d said the regulator, emphasising that this did not break rules requiring due impartiality. Despite the criticism and warnings about issues with its future audience, Ofcom concluded the BBC still has a central role in the lives of many Britons, is well-trusted and supports the production of distinctive high-quality programmes that commercial rivals would not match.

The victims, discovered in a refrigerated trailer in Grays on Wednesday, were eight women and 31 men, Essex police added. In a statement, the Chinese embassy in London said: \u201cWe read with a heavy heart the reports about the death of 39 people in Essex, England.

      "bodyText": "The government has been urged to heed the warnings of the risk of civil disorder by loyalists in Northern Ireland because of the sense of betrayal they feel over Brexit. The deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, Nigel Dodds, urged the government not to shrug off the impact of the Brexit deal on the unionist community. \u201cYou are really in danger here of causing real problems with the Belfast agreement, the St Andrew\u2019s agreement, the political institutions and political stability in Northern Ireland by what you are doing to the unionist community,\u201d he told the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, during an hour-long exchange in the House of Commons over the Northern Ireland protocol of the deal. \u201cPlease wake up and realise what is happening here,\u201d he said. Dodds told Barclay to \u201ctake seriously\u201d the warnings given by the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight on Wednesday. Simon Byrne has repeatedly warned of potential sectarian tensions because of Brexit, but the spotlight up until now has largely focused on republican dissidents and groups such as the New IRA, who have been responsible for a number of recent attacks, including a car bomb in Derry and the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee. \u201cBut similarly, from the loyalist community \u2026 identity is also important \u2026 our concern is also the loyalist community has at times shown it can mobilise quickly, bring large numbers of people on to the streets and engage in public disorder in support of their cause,\u201d Byrne said. Two days ago, members of the loyalist community met to discuss their reaction to the deal, with organisers calling Brexit an act of betrayal and the spokesman Jamie Bryson saying there was \u201cimmense anger\u201d over the arrangements for Northern Ireland. Barclay was also pressed several times to provide exact detail on the proposed new paperwork that would be required post-Brexit for Northern Ireland businesses transporting goods to Great Britain. The development is at the heart of the concerns of the DUP and others who say that the involvement of customs declarations for goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is a breach of the promise that intra-country trade would be \u201cunfettered\u201d. Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs select committee, told Barclay his efforts would be \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d unless he provided clarity in the next few days. Barclay tried to reassure critics by repeating the prime minister\u2019s pledge on Wednesday that the checks for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would be mere \u201cadministrative processes\u201d. Waving a one-page form, Barclay said the process would be simple and digital and not a burden on business. \u201cThis is an administrative process, this is an electronic form, this is part of bookings that will be done with the haulier as part of the shipment of goods and actually involves fairly straightforward data in terms of who is exporting, who is importing and what the nature of the goods are,\u201d he said. While Barclay\u2019s words might ease the concern among businesses, the fact the government has taken four days to explain the nature of exit declaration forms has left it on the back foot in the battle to soothe unionist anger. It is the third day in a row that the government has failed to answer questions on the matter, with the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, also put on the ropes by the DUP on Wednesday. The DUP MP Jim Shannon told Barclay the \u201cwithdrawal deal is absolute rubbish, I used the word \u2018codswallop\u2019 before, that\u2019s exactly what it is\u201d. His colleague David Simpson said Northern Ireland was the \u201csacrifical lamb\u201d to get the deal over the line, a characterisation Barclay rejected. Concerns were also raised by the shadow Northern Ireland spokesman, Tony Lloyd, and his predecessor, Owen Smith. Dodds called for calm and for negotiations to move forward. \u201cWe need to put our heads together and look at a way forward for a way we can solve this problem. Don\u2019t plough ahead regardless, I urge you,\u201d he said.",

In the 12 months to March 2019 there were 370,454 stop and searches conducted by forces under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace), up from 279,728 in the previous 12 months. The rise follows a downward trend in the use of the power between 2010 and 2018, although only 15%, or 58,251, of people who were stopped and searched were arrested. White people made up the largest ethnicity group searched under police powers, at 187,761, followed by black people, who were stopped 70,648 times. However, black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people were still over four times more likely to be stopped than white people. For those who identified as black or black British, the disparity was even greater \u2013 they were 9.7 times more likely to be stopped and searched by an officer than a white person. After the Home Office rolled back restrictions to the controversial tactic in August as part of an attempt to curb knife crime, an equality impact assessment warned that more people from BAME backgrounds were likely to be targeted despite not having committed crimes. The government report also warned that relaxed conditions could create \u201cbroader issues\u201d among the public in terms of their trust in the police. The statistics, published by the Home Office, also revealed that the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act rose by 12% in the same year \u2013 a total of 33,238 compared with 29,662 the year before. Under the act, an officer can remove someone suffering from mental ill health from a public place to a place of safety if in their judgment the person requires immediate care or control in the interests of their safety or others. Although the most common reason for carrying out a Pace stop and search was on suspicion of drug possession \u2013 accounting for 61% of all instances \u2013 the number of people searched on suspicion of carrying knives or other weapons also rose to 59,272. A further 13,175 stop and searches were carried out under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act in anticipation of violence \u2013 more than five times the number of searches made under this power the year before. In March this year Sajid Javid, the then home secretary, enhanced section 60 powers, giving police officers more scope to stop and search people without reasonable suspicion. The move came after official statistics showed fatal stabbings were at their highest level since records began. Then in August, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the current home secretary, Priti Patel, loosened restrictions on the use of the tactic even further. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said the time had arrived to \u201ccome down hard on crime\u201d, while Patel told the Sun on Sunday she would ensure police had \u201cthe resources and the powers they need\u201d to protect people. Of the overall 383,629 stop and searches carried out by forces in England and Wales, 73% (279,601) resulted in no further action.",

      "body": "<p>High school is always a tense coalition of tribes, and so it is in Glendale, California, the setting for Daybreak (Netflix). This community has geeks, freaks, mean girls, obnoxious boys and, ruling with cruel fists, the jocks.</p> <p>Except the jocks actually do rule, meting out capital punishment on a whim. And these tribes are actual tribes, because school is over. Glendale has been hit by a nuclear bomb set to \u201cbasic young-adult dystopia\u201d mode: we\u2019re post-apocalypse now, and the grownups are all bloodthirsty but slow-witted zombies, leaving the mysteriously unaffected kids in charge. Things are gonna get messy! Sadly, those things include the show\u2019s world-building, narrative structure and characterisation.</p> <p>Energetic, imaginative, visually bold and yet so, so boring because none of the pyrotechnics are anchored to any logic, Daybreak centres on a classic gang of misfits led by Canadian immigrant Josh (Colin Ford). Josh was an outsider at school, albeit one of those tall, witty, handsome outsiders they have in teen dramas. Now he\u2019s free, and on a quest to reunite with his beloved Sam (Sophie Simnett), whom he hasn\u2019t seen since the mushroom cloud went up. Is she alive?</p> <p>That grand unknown bubbles beneath the main business at hand, which is the same as in any school drama: in adversity, the kids transcend their cliques to reveal their nuanced selves. Bloody armageddon could intensify that, just as the songs did in Glee or the vampire-slaying did in Buffy. Instead it gets in the way, as we time-hop between Mad Max anarchy and snippets of regular life at school. But the past is not illuminated by a present that\u2019s too busy chortling at people getting a crossbow through the face or a zombie bite to the neck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bf04b40e360309adef73a771d7b4ba8beef0a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bf04b40e360309adef73a771d7b4ba8beef0a62/0_116_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daybreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">School\u2019s out for ever ... Daybreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ursula Coyote/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daybreak has nothing to add to the high-school canon \u2013 its take on teenagers\u2019 inner lives is brutishly unsophisticated compared to, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/11/sex-education-review-netflix-asa-butterfield-gillian-anderson\">Sex Education</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/the-end-of-the-fing-world-review-a-binge-worthy-comedy-about-teen-nihilists-on-the-run\">The End of the F***ing World</a> \u2013 so it throws as much cool stuff as it can in your face to distract you. Broken fourth walls, ironic slo-mo montages, characters observing storytelling tropes as they participate in them: every meta trick available is deployed to mask the show\u2019s empty emotional core.</p> <p>What Daybreak does have is an excellent cast. Matthew Broderick is a no-brainer choice as the school principal whose meekness hides fierce cunning. Ford and Simnett make their flashback romance softly sing, as clumsy everyman Josh worships luminous dream girl Sam, a potentially icky creation that rising British star Simnett has the charm to pull off. Austin Crute brings humanity and sass to the plain weird role of Wesley, a former bully who is now a, er, pacifist samurai; Krysta Rodriguez is a sooty Goth riot as Ms Crumble, a teacher whose incomplete zombification means she\u2019s still an ally to the kids. To clarify: adults are flesh-eating ghouls, except where it\u2019s convenient for them to be something else.</p> <p>Daybreak\u2019s creators would, you suspect, think their lack of a coherent message or consistent voice is a feature, not a bug. This is binge telly, a stack of sugary carbs to be unthinkingly gorged on. Halfway through the season there\u2019s a twist so obvious that, as it\u2019s about to be revealed, you lazily wonder if the guess you made three episodes ago will turn out to be wrong. Surely it won\u2019t just be \u2026 oh, it is.

      "bodyText": "High school is always a tense coalition of tribes, and so it is in Glendale, California, the setting for Daybreak (Netflix). This community has geeks, freaks, mean girls, obnoxious boys and, ruling with cruel fists, the jocks. Except the jocks actually do rule, meting out capital punishment on a whim. And these tribes are actual tribes, because school is over. Glendale has been hit by a nuclear bomb set to \u201cbasic young-adult dystopia\u201d mode: we\u2019re post-apocalypse now, and the grownups are all bloodthirsty but slow-witted zombies, leaving the mysteriously unaffected kids in charge. Things are gonna get messy! Sadly, those things include the show\u2019s world-building, narrative structure and characterisation. Energetic, imaginative, visually bold and yet so, so boring because none of the pyrotechnics are anchored to any logic, Daybreak centres on a classic gang of misfits led by Canadian immigrant Josh (Colin Ford). Josh was an outsider at school, albeit one of those tall, witty, handsome outsiders they have in teen dramas. Now he\u2019s free, and on a quest to reunite with his beloved Sam (Sophie Simnett), whom he hasn\u2019t seen since the mushroom cloud went up. Is she alive? That grand unknown bubbles beneath the main business at hand, which is the same as in any school drama: in adversity, the kids transcend their cliques to reveal their nuanced selves. Bloody armageddon could intensify that, just as the songs did in Glee or the vampire-slaying did in Buffy. Instead it gets in the way, as we time-hop between Mad Max anarchy and snippets of regular life at school. But the past is not illuminated by a present that\u2019s too busy chortling at people getting a crossbow through the face or a zombie bite to the neck. Daybreak has nothing to add to the high-school canon \u2013 its take on teenagers\u2019 inner lives is brutishly unsophisticated compared to, say, Sex Education or The End of the F***ing World \u2013 so it throws as much cool stuff as it can in your face to distract you. Broken fourth walls, ironic slo-mo montages, characters observing storytelling tropes as they participate in them: every meta trick available is deployed to mask the show\u2019s empty emotional core. What Daybreak does have is an excellent cast. Matthew Broderick is a no-brainer choice as the school principal whose meekness hides fierce cunning. Ford and Simnett make their flashback romance softly sing, as clumsy everyman Josh worships luminous dream girl Sam, a potentially icky creation that rising British star Simnett has the charm to pull off. Austin Crute brings humanity and sass to the plain weird role of Wesley, a former bully who is now a, er, pacifist samurai; Krysta Rodriguez is a sooty Goth riot as Ms Crumble, a teacher whose incomplete zombification means she\u2019s still an ally to the kids. To clarify: adults are flesh-eating ghouls, except where it\u2019s convenient for them to be something else. Daybreak\u2019s creators would, you suspect, think their lack of a coherent message or consistent voice is a feature, not a bug. This is binge telly, a stack of sugary carbs to be unthinkingly gorged on. Halfway through the season there\u2019s a twist so obvious that, as it\u2019s about to be revealed, you lazily wonder if the guess you made three episodes ago will turn out to be wrong. Surely it won\u2019t just be \u2026 oh, it is. You could argue that the series evokes a plausibly apocalyptic feeling of nothing mattering any more. The final episode ends with a further attempt at a rug-pull surprise, setting up a new antagonist whose identity is not so much shocking as naggingly unsatisfactory. Will this bid for a second season succeed? Hey kids, who cares?",

As it turns out, Mountaintop is merely boring, rather than excruciating: anyone who wants to spend 90 minutes watching Neil Young arguing about the volume of his amplifier and inhaling oxygen to combat the altitude of the Colorado studio where he\u2019s recording is in for a treat, but better that than one of his arthouse films, which can leave you wondering if the more repressive Middle East theocracies didn\u2019t have a point when it came to banning cinema altogether.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEFS03UnWpI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BEFS03UnWpI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The album itself, meanwhile, reunites Young with Crazy Horse, his most dependable backing band. Like Young\u2019s film-making, Crazy Horse have somehow contrived to get no better at all over 50 years. Unlike Young\u2019s film-making, they didn\u2019t need to improve: from the moment they lumbered into view, horrifying Young\u2019s peers with their rudimentary abilities, Crazy Horse sounded amazing, like some hulking, rusty bit of farm machinery that barely works but somehow generates incredible power. You can hear it on Colorado\u2019s centrepiece, She Showed Me Love: there\u2019s an astonishing moment halfway through when drummer Ralph Molina just stops playing, as though he mistakenly thinks the song\u2019s over, before sheepishly starting up again a couple of beats later. But the potency of the grinding din they create is inarguable, elevating Young\u2019s hokey lyrics \u2013 Mother Nature pushing Earth around in a pram, etc \u2013 adding an unmistakeable edge. They do the same on Shut It Down: the contrast between the sweetness of their harmonies and the corrosive noise of their guitars is enough to distract you from their leader wailing: \u201cWhat about the animals? What about the birds and bees?\u201d</p> <p>The problem with Colorado is that Young doesn\u2019t want you to be distracted from his lyrics: the pretty Green Is Blue aside, the melodies are largely perfunctory and Young talks as much as he sings. He\u2019s never been more politically and socially engaged than in recent years, which has led him to toss off screeds of songs in the all-the-news-that\u2019s-fit-to-sing style of an old protest folkie. It\u2019s a mode that served him well on 1970\u2019s livid Ohio, but in truth, most of his great sociopolitical songs are oblique: the hallucinatory After the Gold Rush; Campaigner\u2019s complex meditation on Richard Nixon\u2019s demise; Rockin\u2019 in the Free World\u2019s equivocal response to the collapse of communism. Of late, his political songs have been almost painfully on the nose.

Here, the focus is once more on politics \u2013 Roberts\u2019s passing is alluded to in the touching ballad Olden Days, and there are a couple of songs clearly inspired by new wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/29/neil-young-daryl-hannah-marry-california-wedding\">Daryl Hannah</a>, but other than that, it\u2019s the horrors of climate change, Trump and the alt-right all the way.

He has appeared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/pmqs-verdict-boris-johnson-resorts-to-machismo-and-cheap-jibes\">only twice</a> at prime minister\u2019s questions during his time in No 10.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the only select committee that can call the prime minister, and this is now the third time that he\u2019s cancelled, despite having given a clear reassurance during the leadership campaign that he would come at an early opportunity,\u201d Wollaston told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think that\u2019s the point here. He knows that he\u2019s been prime minister for months now, he\u2019s only had two appearances at prime minister\u2019s questions, and again not facing this kind of detailed scrutiny, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough.</p> <p>\u201cI do think it\u2019s extraordinary to have now cancelled on three occasions, and last time he cancelled, he submitted himself to 14 minutes of Facebook live questions with presubmitted questions.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson wrote to Wollaston on Wednesday night promising that he would at some point keep a previous promise to appear before the committee, but saying he could not do so on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cI am afraid I must now focus on delivering Brexit in the difficult circumstances in which we now find ourselves,\u201d he said in a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/liaison/correspondence/20191023-PM-to-Sarah-Wollaston-MP.PDF\">scrawled note</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I would be of greater value if I could postpone for a fixed date nearer five or six months after I became PM, so that my appearance took place after roughly the same period in office as Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May. I do hope you understand.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/liaison/correspondence/191023-Wollaston-to-Prime-Minister.pdf\">written reply</a>, Wollaston said: \u201cOur role as select committee chairs is to ask you detailed questions on behalf of the public and we planned to do so on Brexit, climate change, health and social care. It is unacceptable that you are refusing to be held to account.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/10/anger-abounds-after-parliament-suspended-in-night-of-high-drama-politics-live\">original appearance</a> before the committee on 11 September was cancelled after parliament was suspended in the early hours of the day before.</p> <p>The supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">later ruled</a> prorogation was unlawful, meaning the session did not technically end at all.</p> <p>The judges criticised the length and timing of the earlier suspension. Lady Hale, the supreme court president, said the prime minister\u2019s decision to move for a five-week suspension \u201chad the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions\u201d.</p> <p>After suspending parliament for a second time in October, missing another scheduled prime minister\u2019s questions the following Wednesday, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, Valerie Vaz, said Johnson had appeared once out of a possible four appearances.</p> <p>\u201cHe is like Macavity the mystery cat; he is called the hidden paw \u2026 although maybe, in the prime minister\u2019s case, it is the not-so-hidden paws,\u201d she told MPs.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson had spent the morning when he was supposed to be questioned by MPs holding meetings with members of his team and cabinet.</p> <p>\u201cSince taking office, he has spent more than 14 hours at the dispatch box taking questions from colleagues across the house,\u201d the spokesman said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to cancel at short notice another scheduled appearance before senior MPs has been described as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d move to avoid detailed scrutiny. The prime minister sent a letter on Wednesday night saying he would miss a Thursday morning appearance before the House of Commons liaison committee so he could concentrate on \u201cdelivering Brexit\u201d. The committee\u2019s chair, Sarah Wollaston, said the public would have to draw their own conclusions as to why Johnson did not appear. It is the third time he has refused to appear before the committee, which is comprised of the chairs of select committees. He has appeared only twice at prime minister\u2019s questions during his time in No 10. \u201cThis is the only select committee that can call the prime minister, and this is now the third time that he\u2019s cancelled, despite having given a clear reassurance during the leadership campaign that he would come at an early opportunity,\u201d Wollaston told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s the point here. He knows that he\u2019s been prime minister for months now, he\u2019s only had two appearances at prime minister\u2019s questions, and again not facing this kind of detailed scrutiny, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough. \u201cI do think it\u2019s extraordinary to have now cancelled on three occasions, and last time he cancelled, he submitted himself to 14 minutes of Facebook live questions with presubmitted questions.\u201d Johnson wrote to Wollaston on Wednesday night promising that he would at some point keep a previous promise to appear before the committee, but saying he could not do so on Thursday. \u201cI am afraid I must now focus on delivering Brexit in the difficult circumstances in which we now find ourselves,\u201d he said in a scrawled note. \u201cI believe I would be of greater value if I could postpone for a fixed date nearer five or six months after I became PM, so that my appearance took place after roughly the same period in office as Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May. I do hope you understand.\u201d In a written reply, Wollaston said: \u201cOur role as select committee chairs is to ask you detailed questions on behalf of the public and we planned to do so on Brexit, climate change, health and social care. It is unacceptable that you are refusing to be held to account.\u201d Johnson\u2019s original appearance before the committee on 11 September was cancelled after parliament was suspended in the early hours of the day before. The supreme court later ruled prorogation was unlawful, meaning the session did not technically end at all. The judges criticised the length and timing of the earlier suspension. Lady Hale, the supreme court president, said the prime minister\u2019s decision to move for a five-week suspension \u201chad the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions\u201d. After suspending parliament for a second time in October, missing another scheduled prime minister\u2019s questions the following Wednesday, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, Valerie Vaz, said Johnson had appeared once out of a possible four appearances. \u201cHe is like Macavity the mystery cat; he is called the hidden paw \u2026 although maybe, in the prime minister\u2019s case, it is the not-so-hidden paws,\u201d she told MPs. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson had spent the morning when he was supposed to be questioned by MPs holding meetings with members of his team and cabinet. \u201cSince taking office, he has spent more than 14 hours at the dispatch box taking questions from colleagues across the house,\u201d the spokesman said.",

Once Dara\u2019a fell to the regime last year, there was only enough money to smuggle one brother to Lebanon. Rami went. By the time his brothers in Europe finally saved enough for Hassan, it was April this year, and he crossed into Lebanon, where patience for people like him had run out.</p> <p>But he still had friends in the city. One of them let him work in his furniture store a few days a week. He could keep a small commission from whatever he sold.</p> <p>Hassan had been in Lebanon less than three months when security officials arrived at the shop, asking staff to show their IDs. \u201cIt was like someone had told on him,\u201d says Rami. \u201cThe authorities came to the shop looking especially for him.\u201d</p> <p>Kareem was the first to learn of his brother\u2019s imprisonment. A contact arranged to courier $5,000 to a corrupt official for information about where Hassan was being kept. The official charged another $20,000 to release him.</p> <p>Now, when the brothers reach Hassan by phone, he is evasive. He doesn\u2019t say where he sleeps. He is vague about what happened in jail.</p> <p>\u201cHe just says: \u2018Whatever you think prison is \u2013 exactly as you imagine it \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u201d says Kareem.</p> <p>From his room in Beirut, over the din of children\u2019s television and traffic outside, Rami says his brother in Syria keeps giving the same warning. \u201cHe just tells me: hide yourself,\u201d Rami says. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get you.\u201d</p>",

He could have been deported to Syria. Hassan, Syria Hassan was the last of the brothers to leave. Once Dara\u2019a fell to the regime last year, there was only enough money to smuggle one brother to Lebanon. Rami went. By the time his brothers in Europe finally saved enough for Hassan, it was April this year, and he crossed into Lebanon, where patience for people like him had run out. But he still had friends in the city. One of them let him work in his furniture store a few days a week. He could keep a small commission from whatever he sold. Hassan had been in Lebanon less than three months when security officials arrived at the shop, asking staff to show their IDs. \u201cIt was like someone had told on him,\u201d says Rami. \u201cThe authorities came to the shop looking especially for him.\u201d Kareem was the first to learn of his brother\u2019s imprisonment. A contact arranged to courier $5,000 to a corrupt official for information about where Hassan was being kept. The official charged another $20,000 to release him. Now, when the brothers reach Hassan by phone, he is evasive. He doesn\u2019t say where he sleeps. He is vague about what happened in jail. \u201cHe just says: \u2018Whatever you think prison is \u2013 exactly as you imagine it \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u201d says Kareem. From his room in Beirut, over the din of children\u2019s television and traffic outside, Rami says his brother in Syria keeps giving the same warning. \u201cHe just tells me: hide yourself,\u201d Rami says. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get you.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Human rights organisations have condemned Fifa\u2019s decision to stage a revamped version of the Club World Cup in China. World football\u2019s governing body has confirmed that an expanded version of its showpiece event, featuring 24 teams, will take place there in June and July 2021. The decision was made despite China\u2019s suppression of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and the internment of more than one million Uighur Muslims in the state of Xinjiang. \u201cThis is a historic decision for football because the Fifa council decided unanimously to appoint China as the host for the new Fifa World Cup for clubs,\u201d said Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, in announcing the decision. \u201cThe new Fifa World Cup for clubs will be a competition which every person who loves football looks forward to. It is the first real and true world cup for the best teams and clubs in the world.\u201d Fifa was immediately criticised for the move, with Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of policy and government affairs, Allan Hogarth, saying: \u201cChina being chosen to host the Fifa Club World Cup in 2021 presents Beijing with yet another opportunity to try to \u2018sportswash\u2019 its tarnished international reputation. \u201cIt\u2019s likely the Chinese authorities will see the competition as an opportunity to project an image of openness and toleration, whereas the much darker reality in the country is one of pervasive censorship, relentless round-ups of dissidents, and the shocking mass detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang. \u201cChina has an atrocious human rights record and Fifa must use its considerable influence to push for human rights improvements in the country. \u201cAny club involved in a China-hosted Club World Cup \u2013 from players through to coaches and backroom staff \u2013 should be ready to speak out on human rights issues in China.\u201d The revamped cup came in for heavy criticism even before Thursday\u2019s announcement. The European Club Association, a body representing the continent\u2019s biggest clubs, has threatened to boycott the expanded even event. In a letter written to Uefa in March, 15 of the ECA\u2019s clubs wrote that they were \u201cfirmly against any approval of a revised Club World Cup at this point in time and confirm that no ECA clubs would take part to such a competition\u201d. The tournament currently involves seven teams \u2013 with the Champions League winners Liverpool set to take part in this year\u2019s tournament in Qatar. Fifa is yet to decide the qualification criteria for the expanded 24-team version.",

      "body": "<p>It is not an obviously promising sign for a young dramatist when the artistic director of an off-Broadway venue sends a 1,000-word email of sympathetic explanation to those who left at the interval appalled by the slowness and length (three and a quarter hours) or content (sections where the stage is left empty) of their play.</p> <p>Six years on, though, Annie Baker has triumphantly overcome this unnerving experience. The work that led the venue <a href=\"https://www.playwrightshorizons.org/\">Playwrights Horizons</a> to reassure its riled subscribers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/20/the-flick-review-dorfman-national-theatre-london-annie-baker-cinema-play\">The Flick</a>, set in a shabby, old-fashioned Massachusetts cinema \u2013 went on to win the <a href=\"http://www.blackburnprize.org/\">Susan Smith Blackburn prize</a> and was staged at the National Theatre in London, where it has been followed by two more Baker plays: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/25/john-review-annie-baker-dorfman-national-theatre\">John</a>, and, opening this week, The Antipodes.</p> <p>Baker, a rare and reluctant interviewee, eventually agrees to have an email conversation. Although she engages generously \u2013 even while looking after a new baby, and struggling with a bug caught in London \u2013 the precise replies suggest that her public reticence may come from a fear of being over-specific about details that the work blurs. The 38-year-old is the most original and significant American dramatist since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">August Wilson</a>, but her plays should still be avoided by people who like plot and theme clearly signposted. John, set in a weird B&amp;B near an American civil war battle site, has a trick ending that led to people walking out who hadn\u2019t meant to. The Antipodes depicts a corporate brainstorming session for an unspecified product (movie? political party?) and ends in a startlingly unexpected place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9a43a540e91c42ac7f36221141793824d8914d45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a43a540e91c42ac7f36221141793824d8914d45/0_0_2400_3600/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Antipodes by Annie Baker at the National Theatre, London.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An unexpected place \u2026 The Antipodes by Annie Baker at the National Theatre, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has Baker had to fight for the right to be trusted to defy conventions? \u201cI have always tried to make the kind of theatre I want to see,\u201d she says, \u201cand although I haven\u2019t always succeeded, it\u2019s obvious to me that, if you\u2019re making a choice from a place of fear or obedience, it\u2019s the wrong choice. I know at times this has frustrated people.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that frustrates her detractors but excites her admirers is her defiance of generic categories. John has developments that could be seen as supernatural, and if a film is ever made of The Antipodes, different scenes could be classified as arthouse-indie and horror. \u201cI\u2019m not really that interested in genre,\u201d Baker admits. \u201cI guess it goes back to my resistance to rules and conventions. If people say my plays span or incorporate different genres, I hope that just means they\u2019re surprising. I do think both John and The Antipodes start out as somewhat innocent-seeming and then get a bit more mischievous, but that happened naturally.\u201d</p> <p>References to the external world are also oblique. Characters in The Antipodes observe \u201chow messed up everything is right now\u201d and reflect on the \u201ccrazy weather\u201d, and there are clear undercurrents of discussion about gender and race in the workplace. Audiences seem likely to take these lines as allusions to Trump, Brexit, the climate emergency and #MeToo. But, where other dramatists might specify the background, Baker prefers to allude to them. To what extent does she see the plays as political or social reflections on what is going on?</p> <p>\u201cMy plays are very much that,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, though. I wrote this play before #MeToo and before Trump was elected, and yet it does seem to incorporate both events, and anticipate them somehow. I think of my plays as incredibly political, but I have no interest in trying to convince anyone of anything.\u201d</p> <p>When I wonder if references in The Antipodes to an off-stage character who found everything \u201coffensive\u201d might be taken as a reference to a culture some people think is prone to over-sensitivity, Baker\u2019s wily reply is: \u201cThe guys in the play claim she found everything offensive. We never find out if she actually did.\u201d</p> <p>In both her cagey explications and the beguiling ambiguity of the narratives, she reminds me of Harold Pinter, and of Edward Albee, who, when asked what his play was about, liked to reply: \u201cabout two hours.\u201d In Baker\u2019s The Antipodes, we never find out what the business meetings are about, and, in John, a character\u2019s climactic speech of apparent revelation can be interpreted as a fantasy or lie. So is there, somewhere in the playwright\u2019s mind or laptop, the \u201ctruth\u201d about what happened, or is it the case, as Pinter once said to me in an interview, \u201cI\u2019ve never deliberately held anything back from an audience. If you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, then I didn\u2019t either\u201d?</p> <p>She is happy to borrow from another theatrical obscurant to clarify her own position: \u201cI\u2019m totally with Pinter on this one.\u201d</p> <p>Although The Antipodes is Baker\u2019s third play at the National in three years, for a long time, British theatres were scandalously short of women\u2019s voices; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/02/caryl-churchill-at-80-theatre-great-disruptor\">Caryl Churchill</a> had a lonely prominence, apart from one-offs such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shelagh-delaney\">Shelagh Delaney</a>. Did Baker see a similar imbalance in American theatre? \u201cThings have changed enormously since my first play was produced in 2008,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was pretty bad back then.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f344192a8eea781c4558db78a45c34ad920bb8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f344192a8eea781c4558db78a45c34ad920bb8f/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Antipodes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sinead Matthews as Eleanor in The Antipodes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baker wrote one episode of the Amazon Prime series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/11/i-love-dick-review-jill-soloway-transparent-kathryn-hahn-kevin-bacon\">I Love Dick</a>, and has acted on screen. Her credits include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/02/while-were-young-review-baumbach-stiller-watts\">While We\u2019re Young</a> (2014), a movie in which her academic husband, Nico Baumbach, also appeared, directed by his brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/noah-baumbach\">Noah Baumbach</a>. Her preferred medium, though, is obviously the stage, even if her reason is the sort of provocative surprise often found in her dialogue: \u201cI like theatre because it\u2019s so unprofitable.\u201d</p> <p>She means the type of show that she writes. \u201cThe only reason to do it is to make something surprising and strange. I don\u2019t understand commercial theatre, theatre that\u2019s bound to do anything other than surprise and innovation.\u201d Then comes a provocative qualification: \u201cWait. That\u2019s not true. Hello, Dolly! on Broadway was one of my favourite things I\u2019ve ever seen. And also one of the weirdest. But, with the exception of Hello, Dolly!, I don\u2019t get commercial theatre.\u201d</p> <p>One mark of popular theatre is that a second actor doesn\u2019t start speaking until the first one stops. But, as is increasingly common in non-commercial theatre, Baker\u2019s scripts ask the speakers to interrupt and talk over one another.

      "bodyText": "It is not an obviously promising sign for a young dramatist when the artistic director of an off-Broadway venue sends a 1,000-word email of sympathetic explanation to those who left at the interval appalled by the slowness and length (three and a quarter hours) or content (sections where the stage is left empty) of their play. Six years on, though, Annie Baker has triumphantly overcome this unnerving experience. The work that led the venue Playwrights Horizons to reassure its riled subscribers \u2013 The Flick, set in a shabby, old-fashioned Massachusetts cinema \u2013 went on to win the Susan Smith Blackburn prize and was staged at the National Theatre in London, where it has been followed by two more Baker plays: John, and, opening this week, The Antipodes. Baker, a rare and reluctant interviewee, eventually agrees to have an email conversation. Although she engages generously \u2013 even while looking after a new baby, and struggling with a bug caught in London \u2013 the precise replies suggest that her public reticence may come from a fear of being over-specific about details that the work blurs. The 38-year-old is the most original and significant American dramatist since August Wilson, but her plays should still be avoided by people who like plot and theme clearly signposted. John, set in a weird B&amp;B near an American civil war battle site, has a trick ending that led to people walking out who hadn\u2019t meant to. The Antipodes depicts a corporate brainstorming session for an unspecified product (movie? political party?) and ends in a startlingly unexpected place. Has Baker had to fight for the right to be trusted to defy conventions? \u201cI have always tried to make the kind of theatre I want to see,\u201d she says, \u201cand although I haven\u2019t always succeeded, it\u2019s obvious to me that, if you\u2019re making a choice from a place of fear or obedience, it\u2019s the wrong choice. I know at times this has frustrated people.\u201d One thing that frustrates her detractors but excites her admirers is her defiance of generic categories. John has developments that could be seen as supernatural, and if a film is ever made of The Antipodes, different scenes could be classified as arthouse-indie and horror. \u201cI\u2019m not really that interested in genre,\u201d Baker admits. \u201cI guess it goes back to my resistance to rules and conventions. If people say my plays span or incorporate different genres, I hope that just means they\u2019re surprising. I do think both John and The Antipodes start out as somewhat innocent-seeming and then get a bit more mischievous, but that happened naturally.\u201d References to the external world are also oblique. Characters in The Antipodes observe \u201chow messed up everything is right now\u201d and reflect on the \u201ccrazy weather\u201d, and there are clear undercurrents of discussion about gender and race in the workplace. Audiences seem likely to take these lines as allusions to Trump, Brexit, the climate emergency and #MeToo. But, where other dramatists might specify the background, Baker prefers to allude to them. To what extent does she see the plays as political or social reflections on what is going on? \u201cMy plays are very much that,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, though. I wrote this play before #MeToo and before Trump was elected, and yet it does seem to incorporate both events, and anticipate them somehow. I think of my plays as incredibly political, but I have no interest in trying to convince anyone of anything.\u201d When I wonder if references in The Antipodes to an off-stage character who found everything \u201coffensive\u201d might be taken as a reference to a culture some people think is prone to over-sensitivity, Baker\u2019s wily reply is: \u201cThe guys in the play claim she found everything offensive. We never find out if she actually did.\u201d In both her cagey explications and the beguiling ambiguity of the narratives, she reminds me of Harold Pinter, and of Edward Albee, who, when asked what his play was about, liked to reply: \u201cabout two hours.\u201d In Baker\u2019s The Antipodes, we never find out what the business meetings are about, and, in John, a character\u2019s climactic speech of apparent revelation can be interpreted as a fantasy or lie. So is there, somewhere in the playwright\u2019s mind or laptop, the \u201ctruth\u201d about what happened, or is it the case, as Pinter once said to me in an interview, \u201cI\u2019ve never deliberately held anything back from an audience. If you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, then I didn\u2019t either\u201d? She is happy to borrow from another theatrical obscurant to clarify her own position: \u201cI\u2019m totally with Pinter on this one.\u201d Although The Antipodes is Baker\u2019s third play at the National in three years, for a long time, British theatres were scandalously short of women\u2019s voices; Caryl Churchill had a lonely prominence, apart from one-offs such as Shelagh Delaney. Did Baker see a similar imbalance in American theatre? \u201cThings have changed enormously since my first play was produced in 2008,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was pretty bad back then.\u201d Baker wrote one episode of the Amazon Prime series I Love Dick, and has acted on screen. Her credits include While We\u2019re Young (2014), a movie in which her academic husband, Nico Baumbach, also appeared, directed by his brother, Noah Baumbach. Her preferred medium, though, is obviously the stage, even if her reason is the sort of provocative surprise often found in her dialogue: \u201cI like theatre because it\u2019s so unprofitable.\u201d She means the type of show that she writes. \u201cThe only reason to do it is to make something surprising and strange. I don\u2019t understand commercial theatre, theatre that\u2019s bound to do anything other than surprise and innovation.\u201d Then comes a provocative qualification: \u201cWait. That\u2019s not true. Hello, Dolly! on Broadway was one of my favourite things I\u2019ve ever seen. And also one of the weirdest. But, with the exception of Hello, Dolly!, I don\u2019t get commercial theatre.\u201d One mark of popular theatre is that a second actor doesn\u2019t start speaking until the first one stops. But, as is increasingly common in non-commercial theatre, Baker\u2019s scripts ask the speakers to interrupt and talk over one another. Is her acting experience useful in getting the dialogue exactly how she wants it to sound? \u201cI do still record myself reading every scene out loud after I write it, and before I make edits. But the handful of times I\u2019ve acted have influenced my work much more as a director than a writer.\u201d Baker is co-directing the National production of The Antipodes with its designer, Chloe Lamford. This pairing reflects the strong visual element of her plays: the precise architecture of an antiquated picturehouse in The Flick, walls covered in strange bric-a-brac in John, and the exotically sterile blue-sky-thinking HQ in The Antipodes. \u201cI almost always think of the environment and stage picture before anything else comes to me,\u201d Baker says. \u201cThe specifics are, of course, a collaboration with designers and directors, but for me, excitement about a potential set comes before excitement about character, or dialogue, or story.\u201d The audience is allowed unusual leisure to enjoy the stage images because it is a habit of Baker\u2019s to leave us alone with the set.

A report published by IICSA last year concluded that Ampleforth college in North Yorkshire and Downside school in Somerset \u201cprioritised the monks and their own reputations over the protection of children \u2026 in order to avoid scandal.\u201d The inquiry\u2019s final two-week public hearing into the Roman Catholic church begins on Monday. Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, who represents seven victims of abuse at St Benedict\u2019s, said: \u201cThis report reveals an utterly damning litany of abuse at the school and abbey over many decades, and exposes how senior Benedictine leaders both perpetrated abuse and then covered it up, with the assistance and complicity of the wider Catholic church. \u201cThis complicity continues today with the Vatican\u2019s continuing refusal to cooperate with this inquiry. \u201cThe Catholic church needs to be held accountable for its criminality, but unless and until we have a mandatory reporting law, requiring knowledge or suspicion of abuse to be reported on pain of criminal prosecution, these cover-ups will continue. I urge the inquiry in its final recommendations to demand such a law without delay.\u201d",

Bayern Munich have launched a series of blockchain \u201ccollectibles\u201d that is a kind of crypto Top Trumps. Manchester City have done the same, except theirs is a crypto Tamagotchi (the game is called FC Superstars and is made in conjunction with a South Korean company called Superbloke).</p> <p>Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Roma, Galatasaray and West Ham have signed deals with Socios.com. The plan here is for fans to acquire club tokens, some for free, others bought using Socios\u2019s own cryptocurrency, Chiliz (one of 3,000 cryptocurrencies being traded online). These tokens would confirm you as a supporter though what you do with them next is not clear.</p> <p>\u201cOur app aims to connect and bridge global fans of sports teams,\u201d is how Alexandre Dreyfus explains it. He\u2019s a crypto enthusiast, former poker entrepreneur and the man behind Socios.com. \u201c99.9% of fans, especially fans of big teams, are not in the stadium,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause of globalisation and digitalisation there are now hundreds of millions of fans elsewhere in the world. We feel there\u2019s a gap of engagement with these supporters.</p> <p>\u201cThere is currently no solution for clubs to say: \u2018This is a fan and I connect with them.\u2019 Tokens are a way of knowing these fans. There is also an activation play too. Clubs don\u2019t have many things to sell to fans in Asia. They can buy shirts, but most of them are fake. [Fan tokens] are a way to engage and monetise globally.\u201d</p> <p>Dreyfus envisages a future where token holders have a say in the running of their club (perhaps helping to choose the next kit design, say). He says that this is a commitment shared by Socios.com\u2019s partners . One of those partners, however, said they would not be countenancing such measures for fear of creating two tiers of support: those that had the tokens and those that didn\u2019t.</p> <p>As for the selling of stuff, that seems mainly to involve fan tokens themselves. Dreyfus\u2019s Twitter feed features a mock-up of a talk show with people chatting about clubs and their tokens as an index of their value flashes alongside. It\u2019s a cross between Soccer Saturday and a business channel and as baffling as that sounds.</p> <p>Socios.com does not exist yet, either. The first sponsorship deals, with Juve and PSG, were announced a year ago but the <a href=\"https://www.socios.com/\" title=\"\">company\u2019s website</a> still offers the chance only to \u201cstay in the loop\u201d about the product\u2019s launch. Plans for a Pokemon Go-style token hunt this summer never materialised. Dreyfus said he expected a soft launch this month and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex_dreyfus/status/1181203535377121281\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> has suggested lift-off in \u201cthe next few weeks\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are now hundreds of millions of fans elsewhere in the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Crypto went mainstream a couple of years ago thanks to an explosion in the value of Bitcoin. Despite falling back since (a single Bitcoin is still worth more than \u00a36,500) the enthusiasm remains and while practical uses appear limited there are ways crypto and sport, particularly football, intertwine seductively.</p> <p>First, shopping in crypto allows fans in Hong Kong to behave like fans in Harlow, Essex. Second, it allows them to gamble like them too (as Watford\u2019s sponsors are no doubt well aware). Third, it is at least an attempt to create something like a stake in a club for fans who only ever follow the team on the screen. These fans, it should not need pointing out, outnumber the physical variety by orders of magnitude.</p> <p>\u201cWe can compare it to the early days of the internet,\u201d says Iqbal Gandham, managing director of digital investment company, eToro. \u201cCurrently they\u2019re dabbling to see what the benefits are. One of those, I would say, is the ability to go global very quickly. But at this stage it\u2019s probably not [built on] a business case, but more about getting involved in order to get a better understanding.\u201d</p> <p>Gandham believes the current offering remains unclear. \u201cThe companies that release these tokens have to have a long hard think and ask: \u2018Are we really giving something back to the fans?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cDo they get ownership in the club? Do they get voting rights, and if so what do they entail? If it\u2019s a real change it could become a useful thing for an individual to have. If it just gives you a discount on a shirt, I\u2019m not sure fans will react in the way that the clubs and companies want them to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/218\" height=\"218px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for our tea-timely daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scepticism about crypto is healthy and there have been a number of scams associated with digital currency, with the Financial Conduct Authority estimating Britons have lost \u00a327m this year. Questions of utility remain, too, but people such as Dreyfus are plugged into a digital world still not well understood by professional sports clubs or their governing bodies.</p> <p>\u201cWe are just one tool that clubs can have to compete with other entertainment products,\u201d Dreyfus says. \u201cRecently we had the CEO of Liverpool [Peter Moore] saying Fortnite is a competitor to a Liverpool match. Youngsters want more [from their entertainment] \u2013 they are used to being connected.\u201d</p> <p>Where, in his mind, might the crypto-fication of football end up? \u201cMy dream is that one day we would launch a Socios Cup, and the starting XIs would be decided entirely by fans,\u201d Dreyfus says.</p> <p>The question of who would get sacked if the team lost is a question for another day.</p>",

We feel there\u2019s a gap of engagement with these supporters. \u201cThere is currently no solution for clubs to say: \u2018This is a fan and I connect with them.\u2019 Tokens are a way of knowing these fans. There is also an activation play too. Clubs don\u2019t have many things to sell to fans in Asia. They can buy shirts, but most of them are fake. [Fan tokens] are a way to engage and monetise globally.\u201d Dreyfus envisages a future where token holders have a say in the running of their club (perhaps helping to choose the next kit design, say). He says that this is a commitment shared by Socios.com\u2019s partners . One of those partners, however, said they would not be countenancing such measures for fear of creating two tiers of support: those that had the tokens and those that didn\u2019t. As for the selling of stuff, that seems mainly to involve fan tokens themselves. Dreyfus\u2019s Twitter feed features a mock-up of a talk show with people chatting about clubs and their tokens as an index of their value flashes alongside. It\u2019s a cross between Soccer Saturday and a business channel and as baffling as that sounds. Socios.com does not exist yet, either. The first sponsorship deals, with Juve and PSG, were announced a year ago but the company\u2019s website still offers the chance only to \u201cstay in the loop\u201d about the product\u2019s launch. Plans for a Pokemon Go-style token hunt this summer never materialised. Dreyfus said he expected a soft launch this month and on Twitter has suggested lift-off in \u201cthe next few weeks\u201d. Crypto went mainstream a couple of years ago thanks to an explosion in the value of Bitcoin. Despite falling back since (a single Bitcoin is still worth more than \u00a36,500) the enthusiasm remains and while practical uses appear limited there are ways crypto and sport, particularly football, intertwine seductively. First, shopping in crypto allows fans in Hong Kong to behave like fans in Harlow, Essex. Second, it allows them to gamble like them too (as Watford\u2019s sponsors are no doubt well aware). Third, it is at least an attempt to create something like a stake in a club for fans who only ever follow the team on the screen. These fans, it should not need pointing out, outnumber the physical variety by orders of magnitude. \u201cWe can compare it to the early days of the internet,\u201d says Iqbal Gandham, managing director of digital investment company, eToro. \u201cCurrently they\u2019re dabbling to see what the benefits are. One of those, I would say, is the ability to go global very quickly. But at this stage it\u2019s probably not [built on] a business case, but more about getting involved in order to get a better understanding.\u201d Gandham believes the current offering remains unclear. \u201cThe companies that release these tokens have to have a long hard think and ask: \u2018Are we really giving something back to the fans?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cDo they get ownership in the club? Do they get voting rights, and if so what do they entail? If it\u2019s a real change it could become a useful thing for an individual to have. If it just gives you a discount on a shirt, I\u2019m not sure fans will react in the way that the clubs and companies want them to.\u201d Scepticism about crypto is healthy and there have been a number of scams associated with digital currency, with the Financial Conduct Authority estimating Britons have lost \u00a327m this year. Questions of utility remain, too, but people such as Dreyfus are plugged into a digital world still not well understood by professional sports clubs or their governing bodies. \u201cWe are just one tool that clubs can have to compete with other entertainment products,\u201d Dreyfus says. \u201cRecently we had the CEO of Liverpool [Peter Moore] saying Fortnite is a competitor to a Liverpool match. Youngsters want more [from their entertainment] \u2013 they are used to being connected.\u201d Where, in his mind, might the crypto-fication of football end up? \u201cMy dream is that one day we would launch a Socios Cup, and the starting XIs would be decided entirely by fans,\u201d Dreyfus says. The question of who would get sacked if the team lost is a question for another day.",

In a move to update the books, which have been entertaining readers since 1959 and spawned multiple movie spinoffs and a theme park, the action in Asterix and the Chieftain\u2019s Daughter revolves around Adrenaline, the teenage daughter of famous Gaulish king Vercingetorix.

In reply to a reporter, Ferri and Conrad said the similarities between spirited Adrenaline and teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg were purely fortuitous. Set in 50BC in Roman-occupied Gaul, the Asterix books have become a mainstay in the publishing industry, with more than 370m copies sold worldwide. Five million copies of the French edition of Asterix and the Chieftain\u2019s Daughter have been printed, with 2m of those remaining in France where new Asterix books frequently top the bestseller charts. As well as being translated into more than 100 languages, the books have inspired a dozen movies and cartoon series, making it a global phenomenon.",

He said: \u201cI\u2019m struggling to think of a greater contrast with my old job: the bliss of Beethoven and Brahms instead of Brexit and backstops! Maybe there really is another world out there!\u201d Classic FM remains by far the biggest classical station in the UK with more than 5m listeners a week, well ahead of BBC Radio 3 and new entrant Scala Radio. Humphrys recently released his memoir, A Day Like Today, which contained his views on the \u201cinstitutional liberal bias\u201d at the BBC and said executives struggled to come to terms with the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum. Earlier this month, he told the Observer that he had decided to quit the Today programme, which had seen its audience slip slightly in Humphrys\u2019 final three months as presenter, because the show \u201ctotally dominates you\u201d. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just the getting up at half past three in the morning and having to go to bed at half past eight at night. It\u2019s all the other stuff. You\u2019ve got to read all the newspapers, or try to. You\u2019ve got to keep in touch with everything that\u2019s happening all the time. And that dominates your life. And I\u2019ve had enough of that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Popular brands of televisions sold by Amazon and Best Buy in the US contain potentially hazardous flame retardants linked to health problems including cancers and learning difficulties, according to a new report. Six Toshiba and Insignia brand TVs, made in partnership with Amazon and Best Buy respectively, sampled by public health campaign groups contained organohalogens, which are flame retardant chemicals recently banned by the European commission over safety concerns. Organohalogens are considered toxic and have been linked to certain cancers, harm to the nervous system and learning difficulties. The European ban, which encompasses other display-based appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines \u2013 will come into force in 2021. There is no such wide ban in the US, although deca-BDE, a type of organohalogen flame retardant, is banned in five states. The TVs tested by a coalition of public health advocates found that the Insignia TVs contained deca-BDE. Mike Schade, Mind the Store campaign director of Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, said it was \u201ccritical that large companies step up and safeguard their customers. If government won\u2019t act, it\u2019s up to the business community to mind the store. \u201cWhy are Best Buy and Amazon allowing these dangerous, old-school flame retardants to be used in televisions that are supposed to be top-of-the-line? Safer alternatives exist, so organohalogen flame retardants have no place in our homes in 2019.\u201d In a statement, Best Buy defended its \u201clong track record as a steward of the environment\u201d and said it \u201cfully supported the responsible use of chemicals above what is legally required\u201d. It said the units in this report included recycled materials which it said regulators recognize as \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201callow for trace amounts of some chemicals in electronics housings\u201d. It added that the units tested were not from its newer lines. Chemicals from the casings of TVs can leak into the air or into dust that accumulates around the home, causing a gradual buildup in people\u2019s bodies. While it is difficult to blame the flame retardants on any specific case of illness, campaigners say that enough concern has been raised in studies over potential links that a ban is justified. The sampling of the TVs \u2013 on behalf of a coalition of campaign groups including Toxic Free Future, Mind the Store and Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families \u2013 involved removing small pieces of the plastic casings and sending them to a lab in the Netherlands for testing. The Insignia TVs were purchased from a Best Buy in the Seattle area, while the Amazon sets were bought online. The testing found that all six TVs contained organohalogens as their primary flame retardants, with all three Insignia TVs containing the deca-BDE chemical. In 2017, the US Consumer Product Safety Commissioned urged electronics manufactures to reduce use of organohalogens in plastic casings, as well as in other products such as furniture and mattresses. A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the agency proposed a rule in June that would ban the manufacture and distribution of deca-BDE and products that contain it, including TVs, bar a few exceptions. Campaigners say that the agency should hurry up and implement a full ban. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any quick move to address the problem of toxic chemicals \u2013 it\u2019s mainly been left down to the states to act,\u201d said Erika Schreder, science director with Toxic Free Future. \u201cAs a consumer there\u2019s no way to choose a TV that is safer. People are being put at unnecessary risk given that there are safer alternatives available.\u201d Amazon did not respond to a request to comment. Best Buy said it had \u201ca restricted substances list that our suppliers must adhere to\u201d. It added: \u201cFor organizations to assert otherwise is both inaccurate and irresponsible. \u201cRegulatory bodies recognize the importance of recycling and allow for trace amounts of some chemicals in electronics housings made from recycled material. The units in this report \u2013 which haven\u2019t been part of our new product assortment for some time \u2013 do include recycled material.\u201d",

The title of this film \u2013 Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu, or By the Grace of God \u2013 is taken from the staggering Freudian slip Barbarin, made during his 2016 press conference about the case.

      "body": "<p>When I was a kid, my dad stopped the car at every historical marker on our family vacations. He thought he was educating us. But too often these markers were telling us things that never happened and leaving out important things that did. Here\u2019s a quick tour of 10 of the worst historic sites in the US.</p> <h2><strong>1</strong><strong> Wrongest</strong></h2> <p>In Almo, Idaho, a slab of stone carved into the shape of Idaho memorializes a shocking incident in the history of the west: \u201cDedicated to the memory of those who lost their lives in a horrible Indian massacre, 1861. Three hundred immigrants west bound. Only five escaped.\u201d</p> <p>The only problem with this marker is that 300 immigrants were <em>not</em> killed in 1861. Thirty were not; three were not. It never happened at all. A fine western historian, Brigham Madsen, devoted years of research to showing that this event could not have happened. Why, then, does the marker stay up?

I have been in Manhattan in February, and if this purchase that never took place took place in February, that is one cold Native American person. I have also been in Manhattan in August, and if this purchase took place in August, then that Dutchman is about to suffer heat exhaustion. To put it another way, no two people were ever dressed so differently on the same spot on Earth on the same date. We miss noticing this because we are used to portraying Natives as \u201cprimitive\u201d \u2013 nearly naked \u2013 and Europeans as \u201ccivilized\u201d \u2013 elegantly clothed.</p> <p>Finally, consider the most famous street in America, Wall Street, named for the wall that the Dutch built at the northern edge of New Amsterdam to deter attacks from the indigenous owners of the island.

The largest of these was the Jefferson Davis Highway, which stretched from Arlington, Virginia, to Richmond and Biloxi and on to San Diego before turning north and terminating at the Canadian border north of Bellingham, Washington. Just this year Arlington renamed its portion of the route, and markers signifying it have also been removed in California and Washington. The only reason this 4,300-mile highway was ever named for Davis was to tell Americans that he was great and we should honor him. And we did not do so because he had been a good senator in the 1840s or secretary of war in the 1850s \u2013 no, we honored him <em>because</em> he led a movement that committed treason on behalf of slavery and white supremacy.</p> <h2><strong>5</strong><strong> Getting </strong><strong>even the </strong><strong>numbers </strong><strong>wrong</strong></h2> <p>Lee\u2019s surrender at Appomattox ended the larger part of the civil war. In 1926, the United Daughters of the Confederacy marked the end of the army with a plaque at Appomattox saying \u201cHere \u2026 Lee surrendered 9000 men, the remnant of an army still unconquered in spirit, to 118,000 men under Grant.\u201d (The last line has been removed but can still be read.) This plaque gets the numbers all wrong \u2013 not by accident, but as part of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d narrative concocted to persuade white Americans that the southern cause was honorable and defeated only by the north\u2019s vastly superior manpower.</p> <h2>6 Most \u2018heterosexualized\u2019</h2> <p>Historic houses usually tell heroic stories about their builders, leaving out any \u201cbad parts\u201d. Since we deemed homosexuality \u201cbad\u201d until the very recent past, our public history rarely acknowledged the sexual orientations of gays and lesbians. For many years the most outrageous of these sites was Wheatland, President James Buchanan\u2019s house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Visitors didn\u2019t learn that he was probably homosexual \u2013 or much else about him. (The site now discusses Buchanan\u2019s sexuality, as well as historical debates over many aspects of his presidency.)</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much doubt about Buchanan\u2019s orientation. For years while serving in the US Senate he lived with William Rufus King, senator from Alabama. The two were inseparable; writers referred to them as \u201cthe Siamese twins\u201d and called King Buchanan\u2019s \u201cbetter half\u201d and \u201chis wife\u201d. When in 1844 King was appointed minister to France, Buchanan wrote: \u201cI am now \u2018solitary and alone,\u2019 having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>7</strong><strong> Least </strong><strong>important</strong></h2> <p>Every year, the marker program in Texas puts up more than 250 markers, more than most states have ever put up. Some simply don\u2019t merit a sign.

The only problem was, it was powered by four vertically mounted paddlewheels. A paddlewheel works fine on a river, because there\u2019s a difference between water and air, but on an airplane, whatever lift the wheel generates from its downward motion is dissipated by its later upward motion.

As every schoolchild knows, she learned to write and even to speak. But our public history has silenced her. In 2009, Alabama replaced an out-of-fashion Confederate with Keller in the US Capitol, but not the adult Keller, who became a supporter of the NAACP and a founder of the ACLU. Instead, Alabama installed a statue of her at age seven. All other representations in America\u2019s \u201cHall of Fame\u201d are of adults.

But too often these markers were telling us things that never happened and leaving out important things that did. Here\u2019s a quick tour of 10 of the worst historic sites in the US. 1 Wrongest In Almo, Idaho, a slab of stone carved into the shape of Idaho memorializes a shocking incident in the history of the west: \u201cDedicated to the memory of those who lost their lives in a horrible Indian massacre, 1861. Three hundred immigrants west bound. Only five escaped.\u201d The only problem with this marker is that 300 immigrants were not killed in 1861. Thirty were not; three were not. It never happened at all. A fine western historian, Brigham Madsen, devoted years of research to showing that this event could not have happened. Why, then, does the marker stay up? Well, it\u2019s the biggest thing that ever happened in Almo, even though it never happened! 2 Most ridiculous At the lower tip of Manhattan stands a granite portrayal of a nearly naked Native American, a clothed and befrocked Dutchman, and about $24 worth of beads. It marks the exact spot where this famous purchase of Manhattan never took place. A moment\u2019s thought makes obvious that this story is absurd. Would you trade your village, gardens, your hunting rights on Manhattan, fishing rights around the island \u2013 for this paltry string of beads? And do what? Move to New Jersey? People already live across the Hudson, so you\u2019d have to talk with them, perhaps fight with them, before simply moving in \u2026 Then consider the clothing.

As Farrell recounts: \u201cBugs planted in the DNC headquarters \u2026 could provide \u2018a wealth of information\u2019 of all kinds, Liddy believed.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By any rational measure, the Watergate break-in was dangerously unnecessary since Nixon would go on to carry 49 states against the hapless McGovern, even without planted microphones at Democratic headquarters.</p> <p>But at least Watergate, at the beginning, was a tight-lipped conspiracy with the burglars, CIA-trained veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. In contrast, everyone from career diplomats like William Taylor to the government in Kyiv seemed to know about Trump\u2019s plotting in Ukraine.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s explosive <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/\">closed-door testimony</a> on Tuesday captured the dimensions of the shakedown of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Taylor, who temporarily heads the embassy in Kyiv, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/22/us-ambassador-bill-taylor-ukraine-trump-military-aid-biden\">said that Gordon Sondland</a> \u2013 a hotel executive turned ambassador \u2013 told him: \u201cPresident Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something \u2026 the businessman asks that person pay up.\u201d</p> <p>The check was $390m in military aid to Ukraine that Congress had appropriated and the White House was withholding to pressure Zelenskiy. What Trump claimed he was owed was dirt on Hunter Biden and some sort of evidence buttressing the bizarre rightwing conspiracy theory that Ukraine had framed Russia for the 2016 hacking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like Watergate, Trump\u2019s Pain in Ukraine threatens to bring down his presidency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Imagine, if you will, that the desperate Ukrainian had concocted a paper trail to please Trump. It almost certainly would not have made a difference in an election campaign that will mostly be a referendum on Trump. There is no guarantee that Biden will even win the Democratic nomination \u2013 and it seems ludicrous to believe that serious journalists would accept fabricated evidence about Hunter Biden.</p> <p>Like Watergate, Trump\u2019s Pain in Ukraine threatens to bring down his presidency.</p> <p>Nothing better illustrates the increasing desperation of Trump\u2019s hardcore defenders on Capitol Hill than the efforts on Wednesday of two dozen Republican congressmen (and, yes, they were all male) to disrupt the impeachment depositions in a secure room of the House intelligence committee.</p> <p>The Republican protest was nominally over the lack of public hearings on impeachment. But the enduring Washington truth is that when you are arguing process, you are losing.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s written statement ended with an earnest plea: \u201cWe must support Ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor.

From the phantom peace in Syria to the phantom wall on the Mexican border, the Trump presidency is based on the theory that reality is created by mere assertion. The scariest interpretation of the torrent of Trump lies is that the president actually believes the words that he is saying each time his lips move. If truth is this malleable, why did Trump go to such lengths to delve for actual evidence in Ukraine about Hunter Biden\u2019s finances and the 2016 DNC hacking? Without a shred of proof, Trump has been trumpeting for months such debunked claims as: \u201cWhen [Joe] Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5bn in a fund \u2026 and he\u2019s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d Up until now, the failed 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate held the record for presidential stupidity in the quest for re-election. As John A Farrell tells it in his acclaimed 2017 Richard Nixon biography, the DNC was a backup site after Gordon Liddy had failed four times to break into the George McGovern campaign. As Farrell recounts: \u201cBugs planted in the DNC headquarters \u2026 could provide \u2018a wealth of information\u2019 of all kinds, Liddy believed.\u2019\u201d By any rational measure, the Watergate break-in was dangerously unnecessary since Nixon would go on to carry 49 states against the hapless McGovern, even without planted microphones at Democratic headquarters. But at least Watergate, at the beginning, was a tight-lipped conspiracy with the burglars, CIA-trained veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. In contrast, everyone from career diplomats like William Taylor to the government in Kyiv seemed to know about Trump\u2019s plotting in Ukraine. Taylor\u2019s explosive closed-door testimony on Tuesday captured the dimensions of the shakedown of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Taylor, who temporarily heads the embassy in Kyiv, said that Gordon Sondland \u2013 a hotel executive turned ambassador \u2013 told him: \u201cPresident Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something \u2026 the businessman asks that person pay up.\u201d The check was $390m in military aid to Ukraine that Congress had appropriated and the White House was withholding to pressure Zelenskiy. What Trump claimed he was owed was dirt on Hunter Biden and some sort of evidence buttressing the bizarre rightwing conspiracy theory that Ukraine had framed Russia for the 2016 hacking. Imagine, if you will, that the desperate Ukrainian had concocted a paper trail to please Trump. It almost certainly would not have made a difference in an election campaign that will mostly be a referendum on Trump. There is no guarantee that Biden will even win the Democratic nomination \u2013 and it seems ludicrous to believe that serious journalists would accept fabricated evidence about Hunter Biden. Like Watergate, Trump\u2019s Pain in Ukraine threatens to bring down his presidency. Nothing better illustrates the increasing desperation of Trump\u2019s hardcore defenders on Capitol Hill than the efforts on Wednesday of two dozen Republican congressmen (and, yes, they were all male) to disrupt the impeachment depositions in a secure room of the House intelligence committee. The Republican protest was nominally over the lack of public hearings on impeachment. But the enduring Washington truth is that when you are arguing process, you are losing. Taylor\u2019s written statement ended with an earnest plea: \u201cWe must support Ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor. Russian aggression cannot stand.\u201d Sadly, the same thing can be said about the Kurds, whom Trump also cynically and willfully abandoned.",

      "body": "<p>I was 18 when my dad died suddenly of a heart attack. I know now, after working in healthcare for 40 years, that he was already dead in the ambulance on the way to hospital.</p> <p>My youngest sister was 12 and didn\u2019t come with us to the hospital. When we got back we didn\u2019t know how to tell her what had happened. A couple of days later she went to the newsagents to get a paper and the man working there said: \u201cSorry to hear about your dad.\u201d She was really angry with us for not telling her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m very sensitive about information and what you do with it, and difficult stories and how you handle them.</p> <p>Perhaps it was that experience that led myself and a colleague to set up a debrief team for the operating theatres at Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/10/grief-daughters-suicide-never-ends-help-junior-doctors\">The grief over my daughter's suicide never ends, but I can help other junior doctors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am an <a href=\"https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/allied-health-professionals/roles-allied-health-professions/operating-department-practitioner\">operating department practitioner</a>. There are around 45 of us at Gosh. We\u2019re a microscopic part of the workforce \u2013 the total number of staff at the hospital is 4,500 \u2013 but it\u2019s a really interesting and unique career. We work mainly in the operating theatres, caring for patients at all stages of their surgery. However, you will also find ODPs in diverse roles throughout the NHS, including risk management, clinical informatics and resuscitation.</p> <p>Around 10 years ago a young boy (I remember his name to this day) came in for a procedure but went into cardiac arrest. We tried and worked tirelessly to get him back but he died. The whole room was upset and traumatised, and I get emotional about it even now. Afterwards we spent time with the patient\u2019s family, listening to them and discussing what happened. The team gathered to reflect and consider if there was anything else we could have done. It was a turning point in how we responded as a department.</p> <p>Death in the operating theatre is rare. Healthcare professionals are really affected when something doesn\u2019t go to plan; they wonder whether they could have done something better or quicker, and constantly analyse their actions.</p> <p>We now organise a debrief every time something goes wrong, so no one takes work home with them. When my colleague and I started looking into the idea there wasn\u2019t much information about how to approach it. We designed a programme using what little research had been done in the area and filled in the holes ourselves.</p> <p>We have two people who run a debrief. One leads and the other listens and observes the room. Everyone sits in a circle so there\u2019s no hierarchy and all involved in the patient\u2019s care are welcome to attend. We ask people to state their name and how they were involved in the event. Then a discussion starts and people can ask anything. No one takes notes or blames anyone; these sessions are for the purpose of supporting staff.</p> <p>Many places in the NHS don\u2019t run debriefs or stand their teams down after a traumatic incident, but if you want the best from your staff you need to support them.

      "bodyText": "I was 18 when my dad died suddenly of a heart attack. I know now, after working in healthcare for 40 years, that he was already dead in the ambulance on the way to hospital. My youngest sister was 12 and didn\u2019t come with us to the hospital. When we got back we didn\u2019t know how to tell her what had happened. A couple of days later she went to the newsagents to get a paper and the man working there said: \u201cSorry to hear about your dad.\u201d She was really angry with us for not telling her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m very sensitive about information and what you do with it, and difficult stories and how you handle them. Perhaps it was that experience that led myself and a colleague to set up a debrief team for the operating theatres at Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh). I am an operating department practitioner. There are around 45 of us at Gosh. We\u2019re a microscopic part of the workforce \u2013 the total number of staff at the hospital is 4,500 \u2013 but it\u2019s a really interesting and unique career. We work mainly in the operating theatres, caring for patients at all stages of their surgery. However, you will also find ODPs in diverse roles throughout the NHS, including risk management, clinical informatics and resuscitation. Around 10 years ago a young boy (I remember his name to this day) came in for a procedure but went into cardiac arrest. We tried and worked tirelessly to get him back but he died. The whole room was upset and traumatised, and I get emotional about it even now. Afterwards we spent time with the patient\u2019s family, listening to them and discussing what happened. The team gathered to reflect and consider if there was anything else we could have done. It was a turning point in how we responded as a department. Death in the operating theatre is rare. Healthcare professionals are really affected when something doesn\u2019t go to plan; they wonder whether they could have done something better or quicker, and constantly analyse their actions. We now organise a debrief every time something goes wrong, so no one takes work home with them. When my colleague and I started looking into the idea there wasn\u2019t much information about how to approach it. We designed a programme using what little research had been done in the area and filled in the holes ourselves. We have two people who run a debrief. One leads and the other listens and observes the room. Everyone sits in a circle so there\u2019s no hierarchy and all involved in the patient\u2019s care are welcome to attend. We ask people to state their name and how they were involved in the event. Then a discussion starts and people can ask anything. No one takes notes or blames anyone; these sessions are for the purpose of supporting staff. Many places in the NHS don\u2019t run debriefs or stand their teams down after a traumatic incident, but if you want the best from your staff you need to support them. Healthcare professionals aren\u2019t robots, we\u2019re not insensitive and we have families of our own. I have children and I can\u2019t help but let some patients get to me. If I see someone with a head of big curly hair, I immediately think of my son. If you are involved in a procedure that goes wrong you often take it home with you. Maybe you\u2019ll drink a little more or have an argument with your partner. Maybe you\u2019ll even contemplate leaving healthcare and opting for something where you feel you\u2019ll be safe. Healthcare professionals are valuable assets and should be treated as such. We feel that our debriefing programme works. I certainly feel supported, listened to and valued.

Festivals, university loos, clubs and pubs \u2013 if someone could be sat with their knickers down, then the chances are there would be a little white sticker in front of them offering a \u201csafer, greener, cheaper\u201d period.</p> <p>Except they didn\u2019t use the word period back then. In 2002, when <a href=\"https://www.mooncup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mooncup</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s first reusable silicone menstrual cup \u2013 was launched by two women in Brighton, the word was still taboo. \u201cPeople were revolted by what we were doing,\u201d says Eileen Greene, one of the founders and directors of the company. \u201cPeople really weren\u2019t talking about periods at all. We were quite radical. We would do stalls at festivals and trade shows and we would call it the \u2018repulsion zone\u2019 \u2013 this semicircle around the stall where people wouldn\u2019t even want to come near us.\u201d</p> <p>What a difference 17 years make. I meet Greene and Kath Clements \u2013 another of Mooncup\u2019s directors, who joined in 2005, in their Brighton offices. They have outgrown the bedroom in the Whitehawk estate where the company was founded, when a team of two were cramped between piles of leaflets, cups and stickers. Now a 40-strong outfit, Mooncup has a proper office and a kitchen with a long wooden table, which is where the staff cook and eat a vegan lunch together every day. They do yoga here, too, and meditation. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we\u2019ve always done,\u201d says Greene.</p> <p>If you are unfamiliar with the Mooncup, think of it as a bendy silicone eggcup, that, when inserted into the vagina, collects menstrual blood. You can leave it in for around eight hours, because it holds about three times as much fluid as a regular tampon. When you take it out, you just tip the blood away, give it a rinse (a water bottle will do if you don\u2019t want to use the public sink) and reinsert it. Each Mooncup lasts for about 10 years, so the \u00a322 price tag should recoup itself after six months of saving on other sanitary products. I have a friend who has been using one since her teens and, now in her mid 30s, has only ever spent about \u00a340 on her period in her whole life. Then, of course, there is the environmental benefit of ridding the world of the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/plastics_unflushables_-_submited_evidence.pdf\" title=\"\">estimated 200,000 tonnes of sanitary waste that ends up in landfill in the UK each year</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ccfcf4d14fec84ae8dff49d7f353e012adf43188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccfcf4d14fec84ae8dff49d7f353e012adf43188/1890_0_4668_4670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mooncup's new packaging\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New look: 17 years after it first appeared, Mooncup has reinvented itself with new packaging</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it is finally catching on. In the past five years, sales have risen by 98%. The story of the Mooncup is not just about the power of ethical business, but also word-of-mouth marketing in a sector that is dominated by multinational corporations. It has, after all, gone from a niche product sold in healthfood stores to being stocked in Boots and Asos.</p> <p>This month marks a major turning point, too: for the first time since the product\u2019s launch, the packaging has been redesigned to show the cup on the front of the box. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a white box with a flower on it,\u201d says Greene. \u201cWhich was a way of saying: \u2018Look, this isn\u2019t a scary thing.\u2019 Now, we feel able to be more up front.\u201d</p> <p>In the past decade there has been a dramatic cultural shift away from the hushed tones and euphemisms used for anything related to a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. \u201cIn 2015, you could really see the taboo around periods starting to break,\u201d says Clements. She points to the tennis player Heather Watson saying that she performed poorly in the Australian Open because of her period and the musician Kiran Gandhi, who ran the London Marathon free bleeding, as key moments in changing public discourse around menstruation that year. \u201cAnd we\u2019d played our part in that \u2013 very committedly trying to shift the conversation around periods,\u201d she says. But she emphasises that this is a shift restricted to the UK: \u201cBecause in many countries, it is not the case at all.\u201d</p> <p> The first menstrual cup was invented by an American actor, Leona Chalmers, who patented her runner cup in 1937. Greene stumbled on the idea in the late 1990s, when a woman on a Critical Mass bike ride through London told her about them. \u201cI was like: \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never heard of anything like that.\u2019\u201d A year later, Greene went travelling around Australia. \u201cI was camping in Boonoo Boonoo national park and opposite me was this British family. There was a woman washing reusable nappies in a bucket \u2013 which you really didn\u2019t see very often back then, and I was intrigued.\u201d That woman was Su Hardy, whom Greene would tell about the menstrual cup. Hardy was so enthralled that, when she got back to the UK, she managed to track one down in the US. \u201cAt that time, they were fairly rudimentary rubber cups. She started importing them on a small scale, and selling then to friends of friends. They were OK, but some people had a reaction to the latex, so that got her thinking: \u2018How can I improve this? And she came up with the idea of making it from medical-grade silicone instead. She made it a 21st-century product.\u201d </p> <p>By this point, Hardy had moved to Brighton and the fledgling business operated out of her house. \u201cIt was so chaotic,\u201d says Clements. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even move your chair.\u201d The stickers were Hardy\u2019s idea. \u201cSu\u2019s one-woman crusade,\u201d laughs Clements. \u201cShe was going around stickering public toilets. Every day, she\u2019d run off to the post office with this wicker basket full of orders. Each Mooncup would come with a sticker, so our users started stickering, too. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a different concept to the tampons and pads that we\u2019ve all been used to using. People really need to hear it from someone else.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/02/the-women-taking-the-plastic-out-of-periods\">The women taking the plastic out of periods</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a natural hesitance among consumers, whose relationship with tampon brands is often embedded in their school years. \u201cI remember the Tampax lady coming into our school really fondly \u2013 which shows how clever they are about it,\u201d says Clements. It must be galling, then, to see rival menstrual cups flooding a market that they created. How do they feel about Tampax launching its own menstrual cup? \u201cThey have clearly seen a commercial opportunity, that times are changing, and they\u2019ve jumped on the bandwagon,\u201d says Greene. Tampax\u2019s product, however, not only comes in a plastic container, but plastic packaging, too. \u201cYou would have hoped they would focus on eliminating single-use plastic. That would be a diligent environmental approach, rather than just adding another product to the range.\u201d</p> <p>As for the other brands, Clements thinks it is worth cautiously celebrating that their efforts have \u201ctransformed the feminine hygiene aisle\u201d.

So they took a different approach. Firstly, it was the Love Your Vagina posters \u2013 which got them into hot water after people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the word \u201cvagina\u201d being on a poster. Then there was 2015\u2019s \u201cPeriod Drama\u201d \u2013 which poked fun at Poldark, by featuring a weak maiden on the back of a horse with a man, galloping to find her the right tampons when all she really needs is her Mooncup. \u201cThe aim was to allow space for the more complex feminist conversations to happen within advertising,\u201d says Clements.</p> <p>In fact, the filming of the advert turned into a feminist drama in itself. \u201cWhen the trainer of the horse realised the job was for a sanitary product advert, he pulled out at the last minute. Because he thought the reputation of his horse would be sullied,\u201d Clements says with a laugh.</p> <p>I can\u2019t leave without telling the founders the only negative story I managed to extract from the dozens of Mooncup users I spoke to (who were all evangelical about its benefits). It was from a friend who said that, in 10 years, she had only \u201chad one leak,\u201d but described it as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. \u201cWith a tampon,\u201d she pointed out \u201cyou might get a dribble; with a Mooncup it\u2019s a small cupful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d says Clements, thoughtfully. \u201cLeakage usually happens at the beginning. That\u2019s why we have the phone support service to help people who are new to using the cup. Often people place it too high up the vagina, because it\u2019s instinctively where you would put your tampon. Instead, you wear it lower to form a seal with the vaginal wall.\u201d She seems genuinely perplexed and promises to look into the matter.</p> <p>As for the future, what is next for Mooncup is flaunting the new packaging, and trying to reach as many people as possible. Do Clements and Greene ever get bored of talking about periods all day long? \u201cIt\u2019s funny if you\u2019ve been working at a festival for a few days,\u201d says Clements. \u201cAt the end of the week, you often don\u2019t know people\u2019s names. But you know everybody\u2019s gynaecological history.\u201d </p>",

Despite the third-quarter losses, RBS said it remained on track for full-year expectations in uncertain times. The economic outlook forced RBS to take a \u00a355m charge, but Murray said the \u201cslight strain\u201d was due to more than just Brexit jitters. She said it reflected deteriorating global growth forecasts in recent months, as well as ongoing volatility. \u201cThe economic indicators have got that much worse since the end of June,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is sort of the growing volatility in the economics that we see rather than something politically tied towards Brexit, I think it\u2019s important to have the separation.\u201d The lender said it was on track to cut costs by \u00a3300m by the end of the year, but Murray refused to speculate on the future of RBS\u2019 investment bank, NatWest Markets, which suffered a \u00a3193m loss for the quarter. \u201cAs for job cuts, you know we always prefer to talk to our own staff, before we spoke externally.\u201d RBS said it cut 900 jobs, approximately 6% of its total headcount, in the third quarter to about 65,700 staff. The figures are the last for the chief executive, Ross McEwan, who hands over to Alison Rose next week. Rose, who has been with the bank for 27 years, will become the first woman to head a British high street bank. She is the deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, RBS\u2019s retail and commercial banking division, and also runs RBS\u2019s commercial and private banking business, including Coutts. Rose is expected to deliver a new strategic plan for the entire bank in February.",

Labor rounded on the controversy-prone federal minister for emissions reduction in parliament on Thursday following a revelation by Guardian Australia that false figures were used by Taylor\u2019s office to unleash a political attack on Moore last month. Taylor claimed that Moore had increased carbon emissions by spending $15m on travel, a claim that was later backed up with a doctored council document provided to the Daily Telegraph, which subsequently reported the incorrect figure. Asked to explain his conduct in parliament, Taylor dug in, insisting his office did not forge the document it supplied to the Sydney tabloid. The minister said he was \u201cadvised\u201d, presumably by staff, the document the office used was \u201cdrawn\u201d from the council\u2019s website and was \u201cpublicly available\u201d. But Taylor has not provided a copy of the document he sent to the Daily Telegraph or an analysis of metadata to back his claim. Asked after question time whether there was anything else to add, Taylor\u2019s office referred Guardian Australia to the minister\u2019s statements in question time. That has failed to alleviate the pressure on Taylor from the City of Sydney. Moore issued a statement late on Thursday calling on the minister to follow the council\u2019s lead and publicly release evidence of his office\u2019s dealings with the document. \u201cWe have provided conclusive metadata to prove our annual report documents have been available online, unchanged since November 2018,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIf the minister expects the public to believe his version of events, as implausible as they seem, it is incumbent on him to now provide evidence.\u201d Ahead of question time on Thursday, the City of Sydney produced evidence to verify its insistence that it didn\u2019t alter a document to publish the false figures used by Taylor in the attack over Moore\u2019s travel-related emissions.

After question time, with parliament about to adjourn, the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, warned that the opposition would refer the issue to the NSW police within 24 hours if the government didn\u2019t. \u201cThe NSW Crimes Act provides that the making of a forged document that is intended to influence the exercise of a public duty by a publicly elected official like the lord mayor of Sydney is an indictable offence punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment,\u201d Butler told reporters. \u201cIt is also clear that the NSW Crimes Act provides that a failure to make a report about such a document to the police is also a criminal offence punishable by up to two years imprisonment after the person becomes aware of the forgery.\u201d Butler said it was clear that Taylor had used a different document to the the annual report of the Sydney City Council, which remains available on the website, because the document he provided to the Daily Telegraph had different formatting, spacing and a different font \u201cas well as very different numbers\u201d. \u201cThe circumstances surrounding minister Taylor could not be clearer,\u201d Butler said. \u201cHe refused today during question time to do what the City of Sydney has done and release metadata logs that back up his claim that he downloaded that document from the City of Sydney website. \u201cIt is a claim that just does not stand up to scrutiny and for which he will not provide any evidence.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIn other words, the hard-edged scepticism of market analysts and market makers at the time of the contraventions had already deflated Mr Brookes\u2019s inflated views,\u201d Beach said. \u201cSo any required corrective statement that should have been made at the time of the contraventions, if it had been made, is likely to have had no or no material effect on the market price.\u201d However, Elliott told Guardian Australia he would now ask for access to the Myer share register so that he could write to shareholders \u201cand invite them to individually prove their loss\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the upshot of the decision and it\u2019s a slog but very doable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have registered 1,200 [shareholders] already and expect double that easily.\u201d In a victory for class action lawyers and potential plaintiffs, Beach said he accepted the theory of \u201cmarket-based\u201d or indirect causation, where harm is done to investors because the price of securities they buy is inflated by incorrect information. This is significantly easier to prove than showing that an investor directly relied on the misleading statements made by the company when deciding to buy shares. The rosy picture painted by Brookes evaporated within weeks, evidence before the court shows. By 30 October 2014, internal Myer forecasts predicted profit would be at most $95m, and could be as little as $84m. And a few days later, on 2 November 2014, Brookes sent an email to the board titled \u201cThe Good, The Bad and the Ugly\u201d in which he said that despite good recent sales figures, the overall picture was \u201c\u2018ugly\u2019 and even with $6m of cost reduction we will need the \u2018sales start\u2019 to the quarter to continue\u201d. By this time Myer\u2019s internal profit forecasts were 5% more than those of analysts, Beach said. \u201cBut instead of announcing anything to the market, despite all of the negative news in the first quarter of FY15 and its internal profit projections showing the unlikelihood of FY15 NPAT above $90m, Myer appears to have thereafter created a series of internal profit projections which \u2018targeted\u2019 profit figures at the same level as the budget had originally proposed in July 2014,\u201d he said. Myer\u2019s share price has continued to fall since 2015 amid continuing consumer gloom. Shares that changed hands for about $1.70 in mid-2015 closed at 10c on Thursday. \u201cAs this matter relates to historical events and may be appealed, Myer will not provide any further comment on the judgment,\u201d the company said in a statement to the ASX.",

      "body": "<p>Fans of two soccer clubs separated by 12 miles of freeway forged an intense rivalry before one of them ever took the field. In May 2017 \u2013 three months before Los Angeles Football Club signed even one player \u2013 a mural in the new club\u2019s colors appeared in downtown Los Angeles. It depicted men and women of various ages, ethnicities and professions dancing, playing and celebrating soccer while flanking the new club\u2019s emblem: the initials \u201cLA\u201d in an Art Deco motif, with a wing serving as the \u201cA\u2019s\u201d crossbar.</p> <p>One week later, <a href=\"https://www.lagconfidential.com/2017/5/23/15683380/some-angelino-mls-fans-want-a-tagging-war\">vandals painted a \u201cGA\u201d in capitals to the left of the crest</a> and an \u201cXY\u201d in capitals to the right, causing the mural to read \u201cGALAXY,\u201d in a reference to the club that had ruled the city\u2019s soccer scene for years, LA Galaxy.</p> <p>When the teams meet on Thursday night in the second round of the MLS Cup playoffs, the rivalry known as El Tr\u00e1fico will reach a singular level 15 years after the league tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to foster a similar rivalry in Los Angeles.</p> <p>In 2004, MLS granted an expansion franchise to Jorge Vergara, who owned one of Mexico\u2019s most popular teams: CD Guadalajara, also known as Chivas. The new club would be known as Chivas USA, with a uniform and crest imitating their Mexican parent, and would begin play in 2005.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/new-york-city-fc-yankee-stadium-mls-playoffs-citi-field\">NYC FC are one of MLS's best teams \u2013 and they're still playing in baseball stadiums</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vergara and the league saw a mutual benefit. Vergara wanted Chivas USA to expand Guadalajara\u2019s brand among the nine million Latinos \u2013 mostly of Mexican descent \u2013 living in the five counties surrounding Los Angeles. For MLS, Vergara\u2019s investment not only represented an opportunity to cultivate Latino fans, it also provided fresh capital to a desperate league. At the time, only three parties owned MLS\u2019s 10 clubs, and the league nearly went bankrupt before eliminating two teams in 2002.</p> <p>Vergara focused on signing Latino players. Of Chivas USA\u2019s 10 selections in the 2004 expansion draft, four of the first five were Mexican-Americans or Mexican nationals. Vergara also signed two former Guadalajara stars, midfielder Ramon Ramirez and goalkeeper Martin Zuniga, both past their prime.</p> <p>After compiling the league\u2019s worst record in its first season, Chivas USA hired Bob Bradley as their head coach \u2013 the same Bob Bradley who now guides LAFC. In Bradley\u2019s lone season before becoming the United States\u2019 national coach, Chivas USA earned the first of four consecutive playoff berths. In 2007, they finished top of the Western Conference. In the 2009 playoffs, the Galaxy beat Chivas USA on the way to the MLS Cup final.</p> <p>But two factors worked against Chivas USA. First, the team played and trained at the Galaxy\u2019s suburban stadium in Carson while staff shared office space. Second, by trying to appeal to CD Guadalajara\u2019s fans, Vergara risked alienating Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who rooted for other clubs, not to mention the myriad other Latino communities in Los Angeles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a979300738964b9328f657c1a570c2f876af8531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a979300738964b9328f657c1a570c2f876af8531/0_0_3795_2647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LAFC fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many Los Angeles FC fans were drawn from the supporter base of Chivas USA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cChivas USA misjudged, or at least misread, its intended fan base,\u201d said Keegan Pierce, who was the club\u2019s broadcasting and communications director for five years. \u201cFans shouldn\u2019t be forced into picking one set of interests. They certainly shouldn\u2019t be forced into a single vision of what it means to be Mexican or, in this case, to be a Mexican-American fan of Major League Soccer.\u201d</p> <p>Things rapidly deteriorated after Vergara and his wife bought out their partners in 2012 to assume sole ownership. In 2013, Vergara eliminated office staff and refused to negotiate a broadcasting contract. He also demanded a renewed emphasis on a Mexican identity, to the point where two non-Latino academy coaches filed a discrimination suit.</p> <p>That year, Chivas USA won just six of their 34 league games, and drew an average of 8,366 home fans, the lowest in MLS. Frustrated fans even hired a plane to tow a sign demanding Vergara\u2019s ouster.</p> <p>In 2014, MLS bought Vergara out for $70m and operated the club while trying to find a buyer. When that failed, MLS jettisoned Chivas USA after it attracted just 7,063 fans per game. The league announced Chivas USA\u2019s demise a day after the club won their final ever match. Three days later, MLS granted another expansion franchise to a new ownership group representing Los Angeles.</p> <p>That group \u2013 which includes Vincent Tan, who owns Cardiff City in England\u2019s Championship \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/13/los-angeles-fc-mls-john-torrington\">immediately dedicated itself to finding a new home and identity</a>.

      "bodyText": "Fans of two soccer clubs separated by 12 miles of freeway forged an intense rivalry before one of them ever took the field. In May 2017 \u2013 three months before Los Angeles Football Club signed even one player \u2013 a mural in the new club\u2019s colors appeared in downtown Los Angeles. It depicted men and women of various ages, ethnicities and professions dancing, playing and celebrating soccer while flanking the new club\u2019s emblem: the initials \u201cLA\u201d in an Art Deco motif, with a wing serving as the \u201cA\u2019s\u201d crossbar. One week later, vandals painted a \u201cGA\u201d in capitals to the left of the crest and an \u201cXY\u201d in capitals to the right, causing the mural to read \u201cGALAXY,\u201d in a reference to the club that had ruled the city\u2019s soccer scene for years, LA Galaxy. When the teams meet on Thursday night in the second round of the MLS Cup playoffs, the rivalry known as El Tr\u00e1fico will reach a singular level 15 years after the league tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to foster a similar rivalry in Los Angeles. In 2004, MLS granted an expansion franchise to Jorge Vergara, who owned one of Mexico\u2019s most popular teams: CD Guadalajara, also known as Chivas. The new club would be known as Chivas USA, with a uniform and crest imitating their Mexican parent, and would begin play in 2005. Vergara and the league saw a mutual benefit. Vergara wanted Chivas USA to expand Guadalajara\u2019s brand among the nine million Latinos \u2013 mostly of Mexican descent \u2013 living in the five counties surrounding Los Angeles. For MLS, Vergara\u2019s investment not only represented an opportunity to cultivate Latino fans, it also provided fresh capital to a desperate league. At the time, only three parties owned MLS\u2019s 10 clubs, and the league nearly went bankrupt before eliminating two teams in 2002. Vergara focused on signing Latino players. Of Chivas USA\u2019s 10 selections in the 2004 expansion draft, four of the first five were Mexican-Americans or Mexican nationals. Vergara also signed two former Guadalajara stars, midfielder Ramon Ramirez and goalkeeper Martin Zuniga, both past their prime. After compiling the league\u2019s worst record in its first season, Chivas USA hired Bob Bradley as their head coach \u2013 the same Bob Bradley who now guides LAFC. In Bradley\u2019s lone season before becoming the United States\u2019 national coach, Chivas USA earned the first of four consecutive playoff berths. In 2007, they finished top of the Western Conference. In the 2009 playoffs, the Galaxy beat Chivas USA on the way to the MLS Cup final. But two factors worked against Chivas USA. First, the team played and trained at the Galaxy\u2019s suburban stadium in Carson while staff shared office space. Second, by trying to appeal to CD Guadalajara\u2019s fans, Vergara risked alienating Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who rooted for other clubs, not to mention the myriad other Latino communities in Los Angeles. \u201cChivas USA misjudged, or at least misread, its intended fan base,\u201d said Keegan Pierce, who was the club\u2019s broadcasting and communications director for five years. \u201cFans shouldn\u2019t be forced into picking one set of interests. They certainly shouldn\u2019t be forced into a single vision of what it means to be Mexican or, in this case, to be a Mexican-American fan of Major League Soccer.\u201d Things rapidly deteriorated after Vergara and his wife bought out their partners in 2012 to assume sole ownership. In 2013, Vergara eliminated office staff and refused to negotiate a broadcasting contract. He also demanded a renewed emphasis on a Mexican identity, to the point where two non-Latino academy coaches filed a discrimination suit. That year, Chivas USA won just six of their 34 league games, and drew an average of 8,366 home fans, the lowest in MLS. Frustrated fans even hired a plane to tow a sign demanding Vergara\u2019s ouster. In 2014, MLS bought Vergara out for $70m and operated the club while trying to find a buyer. When that failed, MLS jettisoned Chivas USA after it attracted just 7,063 fans per game. The league announced Chivas USA\u2019s demise a day after the club won their final ever match. Three days later, MLS granted another expansion franchise to a new ownership group representing Los Angeles. That group \u2013 which includes Vincent Tan, who owns Cardiff City in England\u2019s Championship \u2013 immediately dedicated itself to finding a new home and identity. In the process, it received support from Black Army 1850, founded in 2010 to support Chivas USA. Black Army 1850, named for the year California became a state, formed the basis for The 3252, a confederation of LAFC\u2019s supporters. The confederation\u2019s name refers to the number of places where supporters can stand in the north end of LAFC\u2019s home, the Banc of California Stadium. \u201cThere were obviously many sectors of the city that didn\u2019t identify with the Galaxy,\u201d said Eduard Cauich, sports editor for the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Spanish-language edition. \u201cThere are many people in Los Angeles that haven\u2019t been to a soccer game in Carson because of distance, and many other reasons. Since the David Beckham era, Galaxy started to focus more in Orange County, the South Bay and other parts of southern California. \u201cMany of the 3252 leaders came from Chivas USA and will never sympathize with the Galaxy, even during the time that they had no team. These people already had experience recruiting and with more resources, became bigger and stronger.\u201d The new owners mined that potential. \u201cLAFC since the beginning has felt more of a \u2018downtown\u2019 team, a team you have easy access to by public transportation,\u201d Cauich said. \u201cLAFC also did a fantastic job designing the identity of the team: a team that belongs in downtown Los Angeles, feels more Angelino, and with a \u2018party\u2019 atmosphere that feels more authentic to the atmosphere they have in their native countries. LAFC became more a \u2018team of the people.\u2019\u201d Then the Galaxy\u2019s Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 ignited the spark to the rivalry\u2019s tinder. In the teams\u2019 first meeting ever last year, Ibrahimovi\u0107 made his MLS debut as a substitute.

Sawsan (not her real name) was jailed for more than a year simply for fleeing her abusive father, according to Amnesty. \u201cI was stopped on the street in Amman and the police asked me for my ID. I didn\u2019t have it, so they said I had to come to their station, but when I got there they found a warrant for my arrest because I was \u2018absent\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two police officers there beat me \u2026 I was taken to the governor\u2019s deputy \u2026 He said I would go to Juwaideh prison until my father bails me out.\u201d Ola (not her real name) encountered problems after hospital staff called the police to report her for being pregnant outside marriage. \u201cI got pregnant and tried to marry the man. But the marriage wasn\u2019t approved because I have no guardian,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents are dead, and I just have younger sisters, no brothers \u2026 I went to hospital and gave birth. The hospital asked if I was married and I said: \u2018No\u2019, so then they called the police. That\u2019s how I ended up here.\u201d Heba Morayef, Amnesty\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said: \u201cTime has now come to end the detention and ill-treatment of women simply for disobeying their male guardian or transgressing gender norms. \u201cThe use of \u2018virginity tests\u2019 by the police in Jordan reinforces a discriminatory idea that male family members have a right to monitor and control women\u2019s sexuality. Such unlawful practices must end in all circumstances. \u201cSadly, we have documented several cases of unmarried women who became pregnant as a result of rape, who were then imprisoned, forcibly separated from their child, or denied birth registration.\u201d The office of the Jordanian prime minister told Amnesty that as many as 149 women are in prison for \u201cdifferent reasons\u201d, but insisted \u201cthere is no case where women have been apprehended for being absent from home without their guardian\u2019s permission, unless this is combined with a complaint about committing a crime or an offence\u201d. Hanan (not her real name), a woman aged almost 20, was also jailed for fleeing an abusive home alongside her sister. \u201cEvery time we ran away, when we were arrested the police would take us to the hospital and my father would insist that they do the virginity tests on [us],\u201d she said. \u201cFamily Protection [police] made it very clear anyway, if our father asks us to do the test, we have to do it. It is his right.\u201d At least 85 women have been held in administrative detention so far this year for sex outside marriage \u201cto ensure their protection\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s office said, claiming that the majority had been released.",

England, whose starting quarter-final XV against Australia weighed a combined 1,587kg, compared with the All Blacks\u2019 total versus Ireland of 1,569kg, will be hoping this weekend produces a rather more satisfying outcome than in 1991. On that occasion the All Blacks won the opening pool game at Twickenham between the two nations 18-12, thanks to a try from flanker Michael Jones and 14 points from the boot of Grant Fox. England\u2019s points came from three penalties by Jonathan Webb and a Rob Andrew drop goal.",

A farmhouse across the valley clearly had not got the message and its lights burned brightly. An occasional car headlight flashed by.</p> <p>But it was dark enough. A couple stole a kiss in the shadows; a child briefly wandered off but was quickly found; an elderly man tripped over a guy rope. And before the clouds rolled in, the stars briefly glistened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45c73a30633713f485b1bff7327ced0b2316ba7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45c73a30633713f485b1bff7327ced0b2316ba7d/0_0_6295_4197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two young children look through a conventional telescope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two young children look through a conventional telescope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peake posed for pictures and was pleased with the event. \u201cAnything that gets people outside connected with nature and looking up at the stars has to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lead such busy lives sometimes we forget to do that.

This corner of south-west Wales is one of the best dark sky spots in the UK but the idea was to persuade the people of Star (population: 21) to extinguish their lights for a couple of hours and discover what they could see in the heavens. \u201cPeople thought it was a wind-up when we first told them about it,\u201d said the county councillor Rod Bowen as he waited in the field for the sun to set and the first visitors to arrive. \u201cI think we\u2019ve persuaded them that it\u2019s real. I hope so \u2013 or it will be a lonely night.\u201d Bowen explained that the area was reasonably dark on a normal night. There used to be a pub and wool mill in the village, which is an hour\u2019s drive from the bright lights of Swansea. Now there are just a few people, cattle and sheep. Legend has it that the village was named after the sighting of a comet many centuries ago by a local minister. The spectacle inspired him to build a chapel on the hillside. \u201cBut nobody is really sure,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice story anyway.\u201d One of the first to arrive as the sun dipped was Richard Davies from the Preseli Astronomy Club, who lugged a one metre long telescope into the field (his smallest). He frowned as the clouds thickened over the Irish Sea. \u201cTo be honest you don\u2019t get that many clear nights here. It can be clear all day and then the cloud arrives in the evening and you can\u2019t see a thing.\u201d Happily this was not one such night. As it became gloomier, Davies pointed out the first stars \u2013 Vega, Altair, Deneb. The crowd began to thicken. Children arrived on a bus; couples and families gingerly picked their into a tent for a talk and slideshow from Peake. The astronaut showed them his pictures of Earth taken from the 250 miles up in the space station \u2013 Patagonian ice fields, the pyramids, the gleaming lights of northern Europe. One of Peake\u2019s favourite photos shows Earth\u2019s atmosphere looking like a halo. \u201cThat tiny strip of atmosphere 16km thick contains the air we need for life \u2013 the only known life in the universe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very special to think that\u2019s all that keeps us alive.\u201d There were oohs and aahs as the astronaut showed them a photograph of Pembrokeshire at night taken from the space station. Compared with brightly lit England, much of Wales is wonderfully black at night. By now it was very dark outside the tent. This event was not without a commercial angle. Google had put it together to promote its new Pixel 4 phone, which comes with a clever mode allowing it to take excellent images of the night sky. A row of the phones was set up on tripods to give people a chance to have a go. It wasn\u2019t quite Bible-black, to borrow a description from Dylan Thomas, whose grave is not far from here. A farmhouse across the valley clearly had not got the message and its lights burned brightly. An occasional car headlight flashed by. But it was dark enough. A couple stole a kiss in the shadows; a child briefly wandered off but was quickly found; an elderly man tripped over a guy rope. And before the clouds rolled in, the stars briefly glistened. Peake posed for pictures and was pleased with the event. \u201cAnything that gets people outside connected with nature and looking up at the stars has to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lead such busy lives sometimes we forget to do that. Looking up at the stars has always filled me with a sense of awe and wonder. \u201cAs a boy, I looked up and began to think of those big questions: where are we? What is our place in the universe? What\u2019s it all about? Those questions don\u2019t go away as you get older, the curiosity builds and builds. You don\u2019t have to be an astronaut to go into space. All you have to do is to look up at the stars.\u201d",

The two new questions on gender and sexuality were shortlisted among eight new potential topics after a consultation process in 2018. In early October LGBTI health stakeholders were surprised by a Guardian Australia report that the questions had not been included in the census test, run in Wagga Wagga (New South Wales) and Logan (Queensland) on 15 October.

Assistant minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, told Senate estimates a decision would be tabled in parliament in 2020. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In October the Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, told Guardian Australia the decision to dump the gender and sexuality questions was \u201cdisappointing\u201d because \u201cit is absolutely vital for us to be counted if we are to have the diverse needs of the LGBTIQ community adequately addressed in government policy and programs\u201d. Since becoming prime minister in August 2018, Scott Morrison has been criticised by LGBTI equality advocates for politicising sexuality and gender identity. Morrison has opposed sex education programs he agreed made his \u201cskin curl\u201d by teaching the fact of diversity in human sexuality, described teachers who support trans students as \u201cgender whisperers\u201d and demanded his department remove signage that gives people the choice of bathroom based on their gender identity.

      "body": "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I use a 9.7in Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet for general browsing, emails, reading digital magazines and some very basic photo editing. It only has 32GB of storage so some apps are installed on its 128GB SD card. However, the battery is no longer what it was, and Samsung has not updated its version of Android, so it is still running Android 7.</p> <p>I am thinking of getting a new iPad because Apple seems to support machines for longer, the apps seem better suited to my needs and, anecdotally, they appear to be more secure. On my budget, I can\u2019t decide between an iPad Air with 256GB and an iPad Pro 11 with 64GB. Both will fit in my camera bag. Is it better to opt for a tablet with more built-in storage or one with a better processor? <strong>Len</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The challenge for anyone designing a computing device \u2013 whether it\u2019s a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone \u2013 is to create a machine that is properly balanced to meet its user\u2019s needs at the price being charged. This is not an exact science. It depends on the cost of major components such as the processor and memory, screen, graphics, storage modules, operating system and so on. But you trust them not to saddle low-end devices with the cost of high-end processors, or to compromise high-end devices by providing too little memory and/or storage space.</p> <p>This is the problem with both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/12/apple-129in-ipad-pro-review-bringing-back-the-wow-factor\">iPad Pro 11 and 12.9</a>, and why you are stuck with a choice you should not have to face.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to read the trends in the technology market, and two obvious ones apply here.</p> <p>First, people need more storage to handle both apps and digital content that is now cheap or free, and, thanks to higher broadband speeds, easy to download. We\u2019re no longer listening to 64kbps MP3 files or watching 640 x 480-pixel movies, and file sizes are much bigger than they used to be. So are web pages.</p> <p>Second, the cost of Flash memory chips has been falling at a rapid rate, even while they have been growing in size. I can remember being chuffed at buying storage cards for only \u00a31 per megabyte. Today, I can buy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/SanDisk-Ultra-Memory-Class-Black/dp/B014IX03CE\">128GB cards for less than \u00a320</a>, which is 64 megabytes per penny.</p> <p>Under the circumstances, 64GB is only fit for smartphones, Chromebooks and netbook-type Windows laptops. Shipping a high-end \u00a3769 tablet such as the iPad Pro with only 64GB is insane. It should have 128GB, which would be a rational fit with companion models that have 256GB (\u00a3919), 512GB (\u00a31,119) and 1TB (\u00a31,319). Then, each step up would double the storage.</p> <p>There\u2019s another way to look at this. If you buy a 64GB iPad Pro 11 then you are paying \u00a312 per gigabyte of storage. If you buy the 256GB version, the price drops to \u00a33.59 per gigabyte, and at 1TB it\u2019s only \u00a31.29. Putting 128GB in the entry-level model \u2013 \u00a36 per gigabyte \u2013 wouldn\u2019t make it a bargain, but it would be in line with the rest of the range. And the extra cost of fitting 128GB would be peanuts at retail prices, without even considering the massive discounts Apple must get for buying them by the million.</p> <p>In short, I don\u2019t think you, or anyone, should buy a 64GB iPad Pro.

Lots of devices have SD card slots, and as you know, this is a cheap and convenient way to alleviate problems with machines that don\u2019t have enough built-in storage.

Standard USB drives don\u2019t plug into iPads, but several companies offer drives that fit into Apple Lightning or USB Type-C ports. You can also buy external hard drives that have wireless connections and iPad apps, so you can store data without making a physical connection. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/WD-TB-Cloud-Home-Personal/dp/B074DXNT7T\">WD\u2019s MyCloud</a> (from \u00a3120) is one example, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/best-external-storage-drives-for-iphone-ipad-3579792/\">Macworld suggests several alternative solutions</a>.</p> <p>In the case of cloud storage and streaming, remember that you can use any cloud \u2013 Dropbox, Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive, Google One etc \u2013 not just iCloud.

      "bodyText": "I use a 9.7in Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet for general browsing, emails, reading digital magazines and some very basic photo editing. It only has 32GB of storage so some apps are installed on its 128GB SD card. However, the battery is no longer what it was, and Samsung has not updated its version of Android, so it is still running Android 7. I am thinking of getting a new iPad because Apple seems to support machines for longer, the apps seem better suited to my needs and, anecdotally, they appear to be more secure. On my budget, I can\u2019t decide between an iPad Air with 256GB and an iPad Pro 11 with 64GB. Both will fit in my camera bag. Is it better to opt for a tablet with more built-in storage or one with a better processor? Len The challenge for anyone designing a computing device \u2013 whether it\u2019s a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone \u2013 is to create a machine that is properly balanced to meet its user\u2019s needs at the price being charged. This is not an exact science. It depends on the cost of major components such as the processor and memory, screen, graphics, storage modules, operating system and so on. But you trust them not to saddle low-end devices with the cost of high-end processors, or to compromise high-end devices by providing too little memory and/or storage space. This is the problem with both the iPad Pro 11 and 12.9, and why you are stuck with a choice you should not have to face. It\u2019s not hard to read the trends in the technology market, and two obvious ones apply here. First, people need more storage to handle both apps and digital content that is now cheap or free, and, thanks to higher broadband speeds, easy to download. We\u2019re no longer listening to 64kbps MP3 files or watching 640 x 480-pixel movies, and file sizes are much bigger than they used to be. So are web pages. Second, the cost of Flash memory chips has been falling at a rapid rate, even while they have been growing in size. I can remember being chuffed at buying storage cards for only \u00a31 per megabyte. Today, I can buy 128GB cards for less than \u00a320, which is 64 megabytes per penny. Under the circumstances, 64GB is only fit for smartphones, Chromebooks and netbook-type Windows laptops. Shipping a high-end \u00a3769 tablet such as the iPad Pro with only 64GB is insane. It should have 128GB, which would be a rational fit with companion models that have 256GB (\u00a3919), 512GB (\u00a31,119) and 1TB (\u00a31,319). Then, each step up would double the storage. There\u2019s another way to look at this. If you buy a 64GB iPad Pro 11 then you are paying \u00a312 per gigabyte of storage. If you buy the 256GB version, the price drops to \u00a33.59 per gigabyte, and at 1TB it\u2019s only \u00a31.29. Putting 128GB in the entry-level model \u2013 \u00a36 per gigabyte \u2013 wouldn\u2019t make it a bargain, but it would be in line with the rest of the range. And the extra cost of fitting 128GB would be peanuts at retail prices, without even considering the massive discounts Apple must get for buying them by the million. In short, I don\u2019t think you, or anyone, should buy a 64GB iPad Pro. Either bust your budget and buy an iPad Pro 11 with 256GB of storage space, or get an Air with the same amount. Alternatively, wait for Apple to release new versions of the iPad Pro that start at 128GB. This could happen in November \u2013 the current models were released in November last year \u2013 or perhaps in March 2020, or later.

The church building, its altar serving as a stage and its original stained-glass windows, wooden beams and high ceilings intact, consisted of a large vestry, two spacious workshop areas, an upstairs costume room and several anterooms used for various purposes. It was a 10-minute walk from home and, this being suburbia in the 1970s, I made the journey alone, often returning home in the dark without a care in the world. There was only one incident in all those years \u2013 a flasher who dropped his pants when I passed by on the other side of the road.</p> <p>The youth theatre soon became the focus of my social life. I made friends quickly and looked forward to entering its creatively stimulating environment, where I took not only drama workshops but also dabbled in photography and design. It was affordable to attend, costing literally pennies. Middle-class kids from Blackheath and Greenwich mixed with the working-class kids from Plumstead and Woolwich, such as myself, without any snobbery or divisions. Outside the arty bubble of the building, it wasn\u2019t like that at all, and I was self-conscious at being a black child in a majority white society and all that entails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef44dd34fbb64e38b6474044f9bce58e6dbc0017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef44dd34fbb64e38b6474044f9bce58e6dbc0017/180_156_1197_1605/746.jpg\" alt=\"Bernardine Evaristo acting in a play that she co-wrote in the 1980s for Theatre of Black Women\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernardine Evaristo acting in a play that she co-wrote in the 1980s for Theatre of Black Women</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @BernadineEvari/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the youth theatre, we learned to think independently and imaginatively while participating collaboratively in drama activities that developed our confidence and honed our performance skills. We put on plays, had major crushes on our workshop leader Rob Tiplady, and later on John Baraldi, who arrived as a blast of energy in 1974 with his exotic Canadian accent. He took us on a magical trip to Norway in the sweltering summer of 1976. For a girl from Woolwich whose only other trip abroad was a day boat trip to France at 13, it was incredibly exciting to be performing a play in castle ruins at sunset surrounded by Scandinavian fjords.</p> <p>I came to love acting so much I couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else. Rather like the writer I eventually became, I relished inhabiting characters who were not myself, expanding my own character, personality and emotions beyond the limits of my teenage identity. I found the process fascinating, absorbing and deeply rewarding. I also liked the attention, possibly because I was a middle child in a family of eight children. I learned that the arts world cherished difference, unlike my predominantly white girls\u2019 school where everyone wore the same haircut, which I could never achieve anyway. At school, my passion for acting continued, and my friend Hilary Smith and I became the leading light of the drama group, and once appeared in a professional production of a play with pop star Sandie Shaw who played a barefoot Saint Joan, but that\u2019s another story.</p> <p>After the Friday workshops, from age 13 onwards a group of us who were tall and looked older would head off to the pub and enjoy half a pint of lager and lime or a small bottle of Babycham, while sharing a single cigarette. Those were the days.</p> <p>After school, I studied community theatre arts at college. I learned to stand for something larger than myself, to be the change I wanted to see in the world. I co-founded <a href=\"https://www.unfinishedhistories.com/history/companies/theatre-of-black-women/\" title=\"\">Theatre of Black Women</a> with Patricia St Hilaire and Paulette Randall when we graduated in 1982, Britain\u2019s first such company.

There was only one incident in all those years \u2013 a flasher who dropped his pants when I passed by on the other side of the road. The youth theatre soon became the focus of my social life. I made friends quickly and looked forward to entering its creatively stimulating environment, where I took not only drama workshops but also dabbled in photography and design. It was affordable to attend, costing literally pennies. Middle-class kids from Blackheath and Greenwich mixed with the working-class kids from Plumstead and Woolwich, such as myself, without any snobbery or divisions. Outside the arty bubble of the building, it wasn\u2019t like that at all, and I was self-conscious at being a black child in a majority white society and all that entails. At the youth theatre, we learned to think independently and imaginatively while participating collaboratively in drama activities that developed our confidence and honed our performance skills. We put on plays, had major crushes on our workshop leader Rob Tiplady, and later on John Baraldi, who arrived as a blast of energy in 1974 with his exotic Canadian accent. He took us on a magical trip to Norway in the sweltering summer of 1976. For a girl from Woolwich whose only other trip abroad was a day boat trip to France at 13, it was incredibly exciting to be performing a play in castle ruins at sunset surrounded by Scandinavian fjords. I came to love acting so much I couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else. Rather like the writer I eventually became, I relished inhabiting characters who were not myself, expanding my own character, personality and emotions beyond the limits of my teenage identity. I found the process fascinating, absorbing and deeply rewarding. I also liked the attention, possibly because I was a middle child in a family of eight children. I learned that the arts world cherished difference, unlike my predominantly white girls\u2019 school where everyone wore the same haircut, which I could never achieve anyway. At school, my passion for acting continued, and my friend Hilary Smith and I became the leading light of the drama group, and once appeared in a professional production of a play with pop star Sandie Shaw who played a barefoot Saint Joan, but that\u2019s another story. After the Friday workshops, from age 13 onwards a group of us who were tall and looked older would head off to the pub and enjoy half a pint of lager and lime or a small bottle of Babycham, while sharing a single cigarette. Those were the days. After school, I studied community theatre arts at college. I learned to stand for something larger than myself, to be the change I wanted to see in the world. I co-founded Theatre of Black Women with Patricia St Hilaire and Paulette Randall when we graduated in 1982, Britain\u2019s first such company. There was little work for us out there. It was the logical thing to do. This year I am the inaugural Woolwich laureate, reconnecting to the home town I left when I was 18, and writing about it. I recently taught a series of writing workshops at my old youth theatre, now called Tramshed and based in the tram shed that opened as an arts venue when I was a teenager. It\u2019s still going strong as an amazing, crucially, affordable resource offering all kinds of performance activities for young people. The converted church that was Stage Centre was long ago converted into flats. It was the incubator of my early creativity, a safe space to spend my childhood. I would never have won the Booker prize last week, alongside Margaret Atwood, if the youth theatre had not nurtured what would become a lifelong career in the arts. \u2022 Bernardine Evaristo won the 2019 Booker prize for her novel Girl, Woman, Other",

      "bodyText": "When she left office in 2015, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner was vilified by her opponents as a corrupt populist who had bankrupted Argentina during her two-term presidency. She was painted as a sore loser, who even refused to participate in the ceremony in which tradition demanded she present her successor Mauricio Macri with the presidential baton and sash. \u201cI was Cristina, the arrogant \u2018bitch\u2019, the authoritarian populist,\u201d wrote the former president \u2013 commonly referred to as Cristina Kirchner in Argentina \u2013 in a memoir earlier this year. Meanwhile, she was entangled in a string of court cases involving accusations of bribery, money laundering, corruption and allegations that she had helped cover up Iran\u2019s involvement in a terrorist bombing that prosecutor was investigating. But in what could be one of the most incredible comebacks in Argentina\u2019s political history, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner seems to be on the brink of returning to office as vice-president \u2013 and potentially the real power behind the throne. Polls before Sunday\u2019s election predict that the former president and her running mate, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez (no relation), could win by as much as 19 percentage points. They are facing incumbent Macri, who took power in 2015 pledging \u201czero poverty\u201d and denouncing the allegedly rampant corruption during the 12-year rule of Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her late husband and presidential predecessor, N\u00e9stor Kirchner. But so dismal was Macri\u2019s economic mismanagement that voters appear willing to turn a blind eye to Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s many court appearances, the arrest of her former cabinet members, and even the discovery of $4.6m in cash in a safety deposit box belonging to her 29-year-old daughter. (No verdict has been reached in any the court cases she is involved in, and as a sitting senator, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner remains immune to prosecution.) Under Macri, the peso has plunged, , inflation rocketed to 56% per year, and the percentage of the population living below the breadline has risen from 29% to 35%. A recent survey showed that 56.9% of voters believe the economy would deteriorate even further should Macri continue in office, while 59.5% expect it could improve under Fern\u00e1ndez. The survey, by the CEOP pollster, predicts Fern\u00e1ndez will beat Macri by 50.5% to 31.2% this Sunday.

She dominates social media and seems to represent a modern-day version of Eva Per\u00f3n, Argentina\u2019s unofficial patron saint of the poor, the charismatic wife of President Juan Per\u00f3n.

The former president is a talented public speaker who made weekly national addresses in office. Macri, meanwhile, is an often graceless speaker, whose wooden delivery did not help when announcing unpopular government measures such as massive tariff hikes. He has also earned the dislike of many female voters for his reflexive sexism, and his support for Argentina\u2019s anti-abortion movement, which prevented the passage of a law legalising abortion during his presidency. \u201cCristina represents an empowered woman,\u201d said Samanta Casareto, professor of history at Buenos Aires University. \u201cFor a whole generation she signifies the vindication of social rights that had been deliberately set aside.\u201d In a radio interview last week, Macri said Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s economic policies were like \u201chanding over the administration of the house to your wife, and your wife, instead of paying the bills, uses the credit card, and uses it and uses it, until one day they come to mortgage your house\u201d. Such comment encapsulate the mindset of a \u201cmachirulo\u201d \u2013 a recent coinage by Argentina\u2019s feminists for a sexist bigot who disrespects women. After the disastrous radio interview, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner responded rapidly with a tweet: \u201cSee?!! I told you he was a machirulo.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner also displayed superior political acumen when she chose not to run for president, instead handing the nomination to the moderate Fern\u00e1ndez, a mild-mannered, moderate Peronist who served as cabinet chief in N\u00e9stor Kirchner\u2019s administration. The surprise move effectively disarmed Macri\u2019s strategy to portray the election as a choice between a safe pair of hands (himself) and a power-hungry, polarizing woman who was relishing the prospect of a return to the highest office in the land. Although Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner is likely to call the shots, analysts say that the promise that her fiery spirit will be tempered by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s even keel seems to have appealed to middle-class voters disenchanted with Macri. Fern\u00e1ndez has assured voters he would steer an even course in economics, seeking a friendly agreement with the IMF and avoiding the return of the kind of currency controls imposed during Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s government. His promise is meant to assuage the doubts of middle-class voters in a country where banks offer dollar accounts to protect savings from Argentina\u2019s perennial inflation. Brazil\u2019s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has described Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, and her running mate as \u201cleftwing bandits\u201d and warned that her likely return to office means \u201cArgentina is starting to head in the direction of Venezuela.\u201d But the election comes at a time of political turmoil across Latin America \u2013 much of it fueled by popular rage at austerity measures and income inequality. Ecuador saw two weeks of violence over the cancellation of fuel subsidies. Across Argentina\u2019s northern border, the Bolivian Evo Morales\u2019s controversial bid for a fourth term as president has prompted allegations of voter fraud, while to the west, Macri\u2019s close ally, Chile\u2019s President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, has been accused of violently suppressing protests over poverty and inequality. In a radio interview on Wednesday, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s running mate accused Macri of downplaying the deaths and violence in Chile. \u201cPeople reacted because it\u2019s the most unequal country in Latin America. And inequality is like sitting on a bucket of petrol, if a spark falls, you blow up.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Throughout my life I have spent a fair amount of time in Croatia and, before that, Yugoslavia. Back in the day, one of my favourite things was to leave my British passport lying around when I was with friends over there. This was the one with the hard cover. It looked and felt substantial, especially to the Croats and Serbs I knew, who handled it in admiration. I specifically recall a friend of mine called Tomislav getting his passport out to show me. This would have been in the late 90s, when nearly all the people I knew there were looking for a way out to some place else. \u201cWhat good is this rubbish?\u201d demanded Tomislav, flapping his Croatian passport in my direction. \u201cWhere will it get me? Nowhere!\u201d and with that he tossed it on to the floor.</p> <p>Twenty years on, how things have changed. Now whose passport is more substantial? Ever since the referendum, my Croatian mum has been badgering me to sort out a Croatian passport. I\u2019ve always felt half-Croatian and always wanted to formalise that with the passport, but now it felt a bit opportunistic so I\u2019ve ended up leaving it until what might be, for all we know, the very last minute. Because I once had a Yugoslavian passport, I thought it would be relatively straightforward. But it turns out I need to locate a piece of paper proving that I was registered somewhere, in Zagreb. That piece of paper should have made its way to my mum\u2019s place of birth from the Yugoslav embassy in London, but may now be somewhere in Belgrade, not Zagreb.

      "bodyText": "Throughout my life I have spent a fair amount of time in Croatia and, before that, Yugoslavia. Back in the day, one of my favourite things was to leave my British passport lying around when I was with friends over there. This was the one with the hard cover. It looked and felt substantial, especially to the Croats and Serbs I knew, who handled it in admiration. I specifically recall a friend of mine called Tomislav getting his passport out to show me. This would have been in the late 90s, when nearly all the people I knew there were looking for a way out to some place else. \u201cWhat good is this rubbish?\u201d demanded Tomislav, flapping his Croatian passport in my direction. \u201cWhere will it get me? Nowhere!\u201d and with that he tossed it on to the floor. Twenty years on, how things have changed. Now whose passport is more substantial? Ever since the referendum, my Croatian mum has been badgering me to sort out a Croatian passport. I\u2019ve always felt half-Croatian and always wanted to formalise that with the passport, but now it felt a bit opportunistic so I\u2019ve ended up leaving it until what might be, for all we know, the very last minute. Because I once had a Yugoslavian passport, I thought it would be relatively straightforward. But it turns out I need to locate a piece of paper proving that I was registered somewhere, in Zagreb. That piece of paper should have made its way to my mum\u2019s place of birth from the Yugoslav embassy in London, but may now be somewhere in Belgrade, not Zagreb. Which may mean a Croatian passport is a long way off yet. What to do? How about a Serbian passport then, if they have the piece of paper? No, no good. I\u2019m not Serbian, and they are not in the EU. I never thought I would feel so fondly of my old Yugoslav passport; it\u2019s the same colour as the EU ones, funnily enough. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Political tensions over an intensifying impeachment inquiry reached fever pitch on Wednesday as Republicans \u201cstormed\u201d a closed-door committee hearing on Capitol Hill disrupting a crucial deposition related to the Ukraine controversy \u2013 a day after devastating testimony from a key diplomat. A group of Republican members of the House of Representatives, chanting \u201cLet us in\u201d, barged into a secure office suite in the bowels of the US capitol where Laura Cooper, a top Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy, was preparing to testify. The chaos and confusion temporarily shut down the proceedings before the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry as Republicans tweeted updates of the disruption from their cellphones, which are not permitted in classified areas. Their presence in the chamber reportedly erupted into yelling matches with committee members. \u201cBREAKING: I led over 30 of my colleagues into the SCIF where Adam Schiff is holding secret impeachment depositions. Still inside \u2013 more details to come,\u201d tweeted Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican congressman and one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, referring to secured areas of the Capitol known as Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, or SCIFs, and Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee leading the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry. The Republicans who led the protest do not sit on the committees involved in the impeachment inquiry \u2013 Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs \u2013 and are not permitted to attend. Members of those committees already include Republican members of Congress, as well as Democrats, and both parties attend and ask questions at the hearings, whether public or, as in this case, closed to the public and the press. But the members who staged protest on Wednesday have sought to attack the inquiry on procedural grounds, objecting to the private nature of the hearings and demanding access to the full breadth of the testimony that has rattled Washington in recent weeks. Much of the testimony that has been made public, however, and news reports confirm key elements of a whistleblower complaint that set in motion the impeachment inquiry. The investigation centers on reports of Donald Trump withholding military aid and dangling a meeting at the White House for Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in return for favors that would benefit him in domestic US politics. The invading Republicans remained in the hearing room into the early afternoon and even ordered pizza and fast food. \u201cReporting from Adam Schiff\u2019s secret chamber,\u201d Republican congressman Andy Biggs began, in a series of tweets from inside the room. Biggs has accused Democrats of conducting a \u201cSoviet-style\u201d impeachment inquiry and demanded the testimony be made available to all lawmakers. \u201cWhen Republican members were in the SCIF, Chairman Schiff immediately left with the witness,\u201d he tweeted. Biggs later clarified that he had \u201ctransmitted\u201d to aides for publication, as the use of electronic devices in the secure area violates security protocols. More than five hours after the standoff began, committee members were recalled to the room and Cooper\u2019s deposition began. Democrats were furious and, suggested the timing \u2013 days after Trump called on Republicans to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d the impeachment inquiry amid mounting evidence of misconduct \u2013 was no coincidence. \u201cThis is a stunt that corresponded very specifically to the president\u2019s complaint that they weren\u2019t fighting hard enough for him, and in direct response to devastating testimony yesterday from Ambassador Taylor,\u201d Democratic congressman David Cicilline, a member of the House foreign affairs committee, said. \u201cRepublicans are playing to an audience of one, and the president\u2019s proud of them, but we\u2019re going to continue to do all the work.\u201d It was unclear if Republicans would attempt to disrupt future hearings. \u201cTheir frustration was boiling over,\u201d said Republican congressman Lee Zeldin, also on the foreign affairs committee, one of the three panels leading the inquiry. \u201cI would imagine things would get worse not better if the process doesn\u2019t improve.\u201d The dramatic escalation by Republicans on Capitol Hill came after Bill Taylor, the most senior US diplomat in Kyiv, testified for hours before House investigators on Tuesday, delivering an account that was so shocking to some lawmakers freshman Democrat Andy Levin described it as \u201cmy most disturbing day in Congress so far \u2013 very troubling\u201d. In a lengthy opening statement, Taylor said Trump wanted \u201ceverything\u201d, including military aid to Ukraine, tied to a commitment by Ukrainian leaders to investigate Democrats and the 2016 election plus a company linked to the family of Trump\u2019s leading 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden. Taylor said Trump \u201cwanted President Zelenskiy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations\u201d. Trump emerged briefly on Wednesday to declare victory in enforcing what he called a \u201cpermanent\u201d ceasefire along the northern Syrian border, after his abrupt withdrawal of US troops effectively opened the door for a Turkish offensive against Kurdish-led forces in that region, leaving scores of civilians and fighters dead and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Trump, who has denied wrongdoing in the impeachment inquiry, spent the morning on Twitter downplaying the investigation\u2019s findings, including Taylor\u2019s explosive testimony. He did not address the impeachment issues or take any questions after delivering his statement on Syria. Later, leaving the White House for Pittsburgh to speak at a fracking conference, Trump was unusually quiet when heading to the Marine One helicopter on the lawn. Meanwhile a report emerged noting that as early as 7 May the newly elected Zelenskiy told senior aides he was already worried about pressure from Trump to investigate his Democratic rivals. Zelenskiy\u2019s group of advisers spent most of a three-hour meeting talking about how to navigate the insistence from Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for such an investigation, and how to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections, according to three people familiar with the details of the meeting. Among the many defenses the White House has offered is that Ukraine had not been aware that Trump was withholding military aid that Congress approved unless it launched two investigations.

This was all relating to accusations of forged documents, accusations that he has rejected as bizarre. It led to the lord mayor of Sydney, <strong>Clover Moore</strong>, demanding answers and now we know Labor is writing to NSW Police in relation to this. I will start with you, Katie Allen. How can this be the case? The council says it is quite clear, the metadata makes it quite clear, that the document said something else and it has been doctored.

I have just actually literally come from question time.

We don\u2019t know why, but it was changed.</p> <p><strong>KA:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be fair, Patricia, I have literally come from question time. That is the first I\u2019ve heard of it. I would much prefer the listeners to be given a proper answer from me about what the situation is. It is very hard when information is evolving as you are in question time, you come to question time to this studio \u2013 I do understand your concerns. I am sure the minister will provide any further [assurances]. But I don\u2019t have any more for you at this point in time ... he was fulsome in his responses.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>PK:</strong> I don\u2019t know if he was \u201cfulsome\u201d, because there are more questions, and this now ...</p> <p><strong>KA</strong>: </p> <p>I am sure they will come to light as we go forward.</p> <p><strong>PK: </strong>Do you think he should provide a fuller answer?

But I do accept that, given the near complete absence of legislated safeguards in the Identity-Matching Services Bill 2019, those concerns cannot simply be ignored. If there is no intention for the proposed identity-matching services to be used to engage in mass surveillance activities, the government should not object to amending the bill to ensure that those services cannot, as a matter of law, be used in that manner.</p> <p>Concerns were also raised about the proposed one-to-many identity-matching service being used to identify people who are engaging in protest activity. This does concern me. It was only this month that the Minister for Home Affairs, the minister responsible for this very bill, called for mandatory prison sentences for people who engage in protest activity; called for the same people to have their welfare payments cancelled; and also called for them to be photographed and publicly shamed. As presently drafted, this bill would not prohibit authorities from using the proposed face-matching services to identify individuals in a crowd who are engaging in lawful protest activity. That would be concerning in the best of times; it is particularly concerning in the light of the authoritarian disposition of the Minister for Home Affairs.</p> <p>A raft of other concerns was expressed about the Identity-Matching Services Bill, including in relation to this government\u2019s abysmal record on cybersecurity.</p> <p>I do not propose to list all of the concerns here today, but I encourage everyone to read about them in the committee\u2019s report.</p> <p>I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee, Labor and Liberal, for their work on this important report. It should not escape anyone watching these proceedings today that, by agreeing to the set of recommendations contained in this report, the Liberal members of the committee have placed the national interest first. For that, I would like to pay tribute to Senators Stoker, Fawcett and Abetz, and the members for Canning, Berowra and Goldstein. I would like to pay particular tribute and extend my thanks to the chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, the member for Canning.

The passport bill proposes amendments to the Australian Passports Act 2005 which would authorise the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to disclose information in order to participate in identity-matching services and provides for computerised decision-making in confirming identity. This bill would also support the objectives of the IMS bill by making Australian travel document data available to identity-matching services by the interoperability hub.</p> <p>Again, submitters supported the broad objectives of this bill. Few objections were raised but there were some concerns regarding the use of automated decision-making, in particular where unfavourable outcomes were made for the subject. Most felt that an element of human decision-making should be kept and avenues for review of decisions should be implicitly incorporated into the bill. The committee agrees and recommends that the bill should be amended to ensure automated decision-making can only be used for decisions that produce favourable or neutral outcomes for the subject and that automated decisions should not ... affect outcomes.</p> <p>The committee recognises redrafting of the identity-matching services bill 2019 may have consequential effects to the passports bill. Should this occur this, this report also recommends that the amended passports bill also be referred to the committee for further review.

As discussed in the committee\u2019s report, the potential implications of these two new facilities for the privacy of all Australians are profound. </p> <p>Those implications do not appear to have even been considered by the Minister for Home Affairs or by his department. </p> <p>While a bill provides for six different identity mentioned services, the service that elicited the most concerned from submitters to the committee\u2019s inquiry is the face of identification service. </p> <p>That service would enable authorities across Australia to use huge databases of facial images to determine the identity of an unknown person. </p> <p>Using that service, a law enforcement agency could submit a facial image for matching against a database of facial images contained in a in government identification documents, such as a database containing every driver licence photo in Australia. </p> <p>In return, the agency would receive a small number of matching or near matching facial images from the database. </p> <p>The agency could then access biographical information associated with those images. </p> <p>The potential for such a service to be used for mass or blanket surveillance, such as CCTV being used to identify Australians going about their business in real time was raised by numerous submitters to the inquiry. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db0df618f08142786c5060e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T23:16:57.200Z\">12.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In September <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/06/labor-unions-take-aim-at-fair-works-deputy-president-over-social-media-posts\">Guardian Australia reported</a> on Labor and union outrage about the social media posts of a Coalition-appointed deputy president of the Fair Work Commission, <strong>Gerard Boyce</strong>.<br>In a series of social media posts Boyce:</p> <ul> <li>Said it was \u201cdefinitely time\u201d for Labor to conduct a review, after losing the 2019 election</li> <li>Described the unions\u2019 election campaign as a \u201cbig waste of money\u201d; and</li> <li>Days after the 18 May election loss, posted an article from the West Australian arguing that Labor had botched the \u201cunloseable\u201d election with the observation \u201coooooooops!!\u201d</li> </ul> <p><br>AAP has this update from Senate Estimates on Wednesday night:</p> <p><em>Fair Work general manager <strong>Bernadette O\u2019Neill </strong>said all commission members had a code of conduct which included not engaging in political matters.</em></p> <p><em>She said the issue had been dealt with internally after Fair Work president<strong> Ian Ross</strong> spoke to Mr Boyce.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThe member gave an undertaking not to engage in social media,\u201d Ms O\u2019Neill told a Senate hearing on Wednesday night.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db0df3c8f08c78d1cb50032\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T23:16:40.562Z\">12.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While the security committee boilover was proceeding in the House, DFAT estimates was focussed on the Uighurs.

The foreign minister also had a very good meeting at which I was present in New York with her counterpart.</p> <p>Those meetings, it\u2019s important that they occur as regularly as they can, because they enable us to talk to each other about the nature of the relationship in all of its dimensions, including areas where we have differences. Those differences have been well publicised, not always accurately, but they exist and I think there\u2019s no point in us at all, pretending that they\u2019re not there. </p> <p><strong>In fact, I think if we were to characterise our current relationship with China and the relationship going forward, it will be a relationship where we will need on both sides to work quite hard to manage what I really think will be enduring differences.</strong></p> <p>Some points of difference may come and go and be able to be resolved. But other points of difference, which go more deeply to the differences between our systems and our values are likely to endure.<br></p> <p>It should therefore not be surprising in my view that a relationship where there are points of difference, some of them which are actively canvassed in the public domain, that is \u2013 I don\u2019t particularly like the term \u201cnew normal\u201d, but I think it does apply in this situation. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T23:02:14.204Z\">at 12.02am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db0d4b08f08142786c505f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:32:36.982Z\">11.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That bill <strong>Andrew Hastie</strong> is about to report on has been quite controversial. <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6386\">Mostly because it creates a national ID register:</a></p> <p>1. This Bill amends the <em>Australian Passports Act 2005</em> (Passports Act) to provide a legal basis for ensuring that the minister is able to make Australian travel document data available for all the purposes of, and by the automated means intrinsic to, the identity-matching services to which the Commonwealth and the States and Territories agreed in the <em>Intergovernmental Agreement on Identity Matching Services</em> (IGA), signed at a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on 5 October 2017. </p> <p>2. The services will enable identity matching based on personal information held in government systems nationally. They include a number of biometric services in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade intends to participate. One, the Face Verification Service (FVS), will allow Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, and potentially in future the private sector, to verify the known or claimed identities of individuals by reference to facial images in government identity records. Another, the Face Identification Service (FIS), will allow authorised facial recognition specialists in law enforcement, national security and anti-corruption agencies to identify unknown persons. Beyond the FVS and the FIS, an Identity Data Sharing Service will allow for the secure sharing of biometric identity information in other circumstances.</p> <p>3. Subsidiary to the IGA, a Participation Agreement (PA) will regulate access to the services by individual Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. Among other things, the IGA provides that strict privacy, transparency and accountability controls must apply to all the services. The Department of Home Affairs will administer the services and oversee compliance with these controls.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:40:26.771Z\">at 11.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db0d4158f0898437061b71e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:31:06.000Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This has been put on the notice paper for this morning:</p> <p><strong>Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security</strong> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=260805\">Mr Hastie</a> (Chair \u2014 Canning) to present the following report and seek leave to make a statement:</p> <p><em>Advisory report on the Identity-matching Services Bill 2019 and the Australian Passports Amendment (Identity-matching Services) Bill 2019</em> .</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:31:58.576Z\">at 11.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db0d3b78f08993584c8abf0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:27:19.933Z\">11.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The bells are ringing \u2013 the house is about to get under way.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:29:29.795Z\">at 11.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db0d0938f0804be7279b1dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:15:40.765Z\">11.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Matt Canavan </strong>will be fronting estimates this morning, where the northern Australia infrastructure fund will be under the microscope.</p> <p>It\u2019s unkindly called the \u201cno actual infrastructure fund\u201d by its critics in the hallways, because there hasn\u2019t been a lot of things actually built by the $5bn concessional loan fund, which was <strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s</strong> idea to turn the north into an \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:16:56.580Z\">at 11.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db0cda98f0804be7279b1d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T22:10:09.549Z\">11.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> made a speech at the awards, where he heavily focused on the economic contribution of migrants.<strong> Peter Scanlon</strong>, a former Migration Council of Australia chair,<strong> </strong>spoke immediately afterwards. <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/philanthropist-peter-scanlon-praises-courageous-immigrants-in-migration-award-speech\">SBS was there </a> and kindly let me let listen to the speech (and, if you aren\u2019t watching SBS news, you should be, because they are doing great work in this space):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For at least 50 years after world war two, political leaders from both major parties spoke directly to the Australian people about the economic, social and cultural benefits of the nation\u2019s immigration program. </p> <p><strong>To me however, I sense in the last 20 years, our leaders have become more reluctant to discuss the program\u2019s full impact on Australian life, dwelling mainly on its economic benefits and less on its nation building.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>There was spontaneous applause.

I, along with many other Australians, am very troubled by the repressive surveillance state and how the Uighur people are being banned from practising their religious faith and how they are being oppressively monitored in their homes, in their communities 24/7. I am very troubled by the way that Uighurs\u2019 culture and identity is being systematically assaulted, deconstructed and scrubbed out by the authorities. I am very troubled about the clear evidence of re-education camps, where 1 million Uighurs have been forcibly detained and indoctrinated into communists\u2019 thinking. The ABC, along with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, have managed to identify 28 detention camps using satellite imagery. Most of these detained have never committed a crime. I could go on. It was a heartbreaking episode that we all needed to watch and absorb. I congratulate the ABC for running it and for the work that went into it.</p> <p>Last month I met with members of the Australian Uighur community in my parliamentary office. That delegation was led by <strong>Nurmuhammad Majid</strong>. It was my great honour to host them and to hear their personal stories. Every single one of them sitting in my office had family and friends interned or trapped in Xinjiang province. They have shown great courage and perseverance despite the tears, heartache and pain. I made a commitment to them that I would raise their plight in this House, tonight I fulfil that commitment. I say to them that we might not see resolution soon, but we will continue to work with you and make sure your loved ones are not forgotten.</p> <p>Finally, the Four Corners program identified a range of Australian businesses that were sourcing cotton from Xinjiang province, potentially using Uighur forced labour. Cotton On and Target Australia were two of them. Subsequent to the program, both businesses conducted internal reviews of their supply chains and have ceased sourcing cotton from Xinjiang province. I want to note the actions of Cotton On and Target Australia in this House and applaud them for taking the action that they have taken. Australia is a country that lives by the values of freedom and fairness, and so it is right that we acknowledge when our businesses do the right thing. I thank the House.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T21:25:13.163Z\">at 10.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db0c1478f0898437061b6e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T21:09:00.191Z\">10.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Andrew Hastie speaks up for persecuted Uighurs in China</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Looks like <strong>Andrew Hastie </strong>made an interesting speech in the House late last night:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tonight I rise to speak on behalf of those who are vulnerable, persecuted and separated from their loved ones. Tonight I speak for Uighur Australians, who have family and friends facing systematic persecution and internment in Xinjiang province, in the People\u2019s Republic of China. But first I want to say a few words about the role of Australian investigative journalism and its importance for a free, democratic society.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>As this House is aware, the parliamentary joint committee for intelligence and security is conducting an inquiry into the freedom of the press. As the chair, it would be improper for me to make remarks about committee deliberations or what conclusions we might reach in our report, but I do want to say that we all agree that public interest and investigative journalism is vital to a thriving, liberal democracy \u2013 particularly when it comes to national security or human rights issues.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>A superb example of good investigative journalism is the July Four Corners program of Tell the World by ABC reporter <strong>Sophie McNeil</strong>. The program detailed the plight and suffering of more than 1 million Muslim minorities who have been rounded up, detained and and forcibly indoctrinated by the Chinese communist regime. Australian citizens or permanent residents have been targeted and jailed. Others are trapped under state surveillance, their passports seized. I was deeply moved by those who courageously showed the story on the program. I was moved by those who have been separated from their loved ones.

The blog will be back for the Senate-only week on 11 November (Senate-palooza is back bbs!) but the House won\u2019t return until 25 November, when the parliament sits for the final fortnight of the year. Make sure you check back on the Guardian site for news updates in between \u2013 the Canberra bureau (including me) and the rest of the Guardian brains trust will be dishing you up all the stories from politics and beyond. Mike Bowers will be back when we reconvene as well, so you have that to look forward to. And, if you haven\u2019t already, you have an opportunity to have your say on question time A big thank you to everyone for the last couple of weeks. I could not do it with my colleagues, who keep this blog ticking over. And of course, as always, the biggest thank you to you for following along. We\u2019ll be back soon. Please \u2013 take care of you. The House is adjourned until 25 November. The October Agriculture Ministers\u2019 Forum is being held tomorrow in Melbourne. Penny Wong is asking Marise Payne what our climate strategy is from a foreign affairs point of view, pointing out that she has been asking this same question since 2016 and is yet to get an answer. She looks like she has a headache which is sitting just behind her eyes and slowly taking over her entire head, and I have to say \u2013 I can relate. On Paul Karp\u2019s story about the sexuality questions dumped from the census, Katie Allen says: I will be writing to the chief statistician, because the decision will be made next year in 2020. So, a test case isn\u2019t [what will necessary end in the final census] ... I\u2019m a data scientist. So, this is what I live and breathe. It is about rolling out a test census, but that doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the final word on what will be in there in 2020. I personally will be writing to the chief statistician, because I do believe we need to have questions such as those being discussed. I haven\u2019t seen the actual content of the questions. It is important that we get the questions right, because we know the LGBTI communities are more vulnerable with regards to some aspects of healthcare provision, particularly some aspects of mental health care. With a large and vibrant community \u2013 LGBTI community \u2013 in their transport, Higgins, I will be writing to talk about what are the possibilities of adding the questions in next year. Liberal MP Katie Allen has read her talking points on Angus Taylor and the documents and no more. Patricia Karvelas has the backbencher on Afternoon Briefing and asks: Angus Taylor was grilled in question time today. This was all relating to accusations of forged documents, accusations that he has rejected as bizarre. It led to the lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, demanding answers and now we know Labor is writing to NSW Police in relation to this. I will start with you, Katie Allen. How can this be the case? The council says it is quite clear, the metadata makes it quite clear, that the document said something else and it has been doctored. Doesn\u2019t the minister and the government need to provide an answer on how this document ended up being published that was so inaccurate? KA: Well, Patricia, I think you saw in question time today that the minister actually gave a fulsome response. He said he thinks it\u2019s a ridiculous question and that he was quite comfortable with what he had to say. So, I think I would leave it there. I have just actually literally come from question time. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the minister has responded in question time. PK: I know it\u2019s not an allegation about you, but actually I don\u2019t know if he has answered the questions, Katie Allen. The document he refers to was clearly not on the website. Something changed. Isn\u2019t it just common sense to find out why it changed? We don\u2019t know why, but it was changed. KA: To be fair, Patricia, I have literally come from question time. That is the first I\u2019ve heard of it. I would much prefer the listeners to be given a proper answer from me about what the situation is. It is very hard when information is evolving as you are in question time, you come to question time to this studio \u2013 I do understand your concerns. I am sure the minister will provide any further [assurances]. But I don\u2019t have any more for you at this point in time ... he was fulsome in his responses. PK: I don\u2019t know if he was \u201cfulsome\u201d, because there are more questions, and this now ... KA: I am sure they will come to light as we go forward. PK: Do you think he should provide a fuller answer? That\u2019s the real question. KA: Well, it is hard to answer questions when you don\u2019t have the full information. I\u2019m an evidence-based person. I haven\u2019t seen the reports for myself. The first I hear of it was in question time. I will be interested to see how the story evolves. The 2020 sitting calendar is out (it is not yet approved, but most likely will be) And then there is also: 254 Using false document A person who uses a false document, knowing that it is false, with the intention of \u2014 (a) inducing some person to accept it as genuine; and (b) because of its being accepted as genuine \u2014 (i) obtaining any property belonging to another; or (ii) obtaining any financial advantage or causing any financial disadvantage; or (iii) influencing the exercise of a public duty; is guilty of an offence. Maximum penalty \u2014 imprisonment for 10 years. 316 Concealing serious indictable offence (1) An adult \u2013 (a) who knows or believes that a serious indictable offence has been committed by another person, and (b) who knows or believes that he or she has information that might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of the offender or the prosecution or conviction of the offender for that offence, and (c) who fails without reasonable excuse to bring that information to the attention of a member of the NSW Police Force or other appropriate authority, is guilty of an offence. Maximum penalty \u2013 imprisonment for: (a) 2 years \u2013 if the maximum penalty for the serious indictable offence is not more than 10 years imprisonment; or (b) 3 years \u2013 if the maximum penalty for the serious indictable offence is more than 10 years imprisonment but not more than 20 years imprisonment; or (c) 5 years \u2013 if the maximum penalty for the serious indictable offence is more than 20 years imprisonment. (2) A person who solicits, accepts or agrees to accept any benefit for the person or any other person in consideration for doing anything that would be an offence under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence. Maximum penalty \u2013 imprisonment for: (a) 5 years \u2013 if the maximum penalty for the serious indictable offence is not more than 10 years imprisonment; or (b) 6 years \u2013 if the maximum penalty for the serious indictable offence is more than 10 years imprisonment but not more than 20 years imprisonment; or (c) 7 years \u2013 if the maximum penalty for the serious indictable offence is more than 20 years imprisonment. That was the main section referred to in question time, but Labor is also raising: 249O Public duty \u2014 meaning For the purposes of this part, a public duty means a power, authority, duty or function \u2014 (a) that is conferred on a person as the holder of a public office; or (b) that a person holds himself or herself out as having as the holder of a public office. 253 Forgery \u2014 making false document A person who makes a false document with the intention that the person or another will use it \u2014 (a) to induce some person to accept it as genuine; and (b) because of its being accepted as genuine \u2014 (i) to obtain any property belonging to another; or (ii) to obtain any financial advantage or cause any financial disadvantage; or (iii) to influence the exercise of a public duty; is guilty of the offence of forgery. Maximum penalty \u2014 imprisonment for 10 years. Here is the part of the New South Wales crime act that Labor is talking about making a referral under CRIMES ACT 1900 \u2013 SECT 253 Forgery \u2013 making false document A person who makes a false document with the intention that the person or another will use it \u2013 (a) to induce some person to accept it as genuine; and (b) because of its being accepted as genuine \u2013 (i) to obtain any property belonging to another; or (ii) to obtain any financial advantage or cause any financial disadvantage; or (iii) to influence the exercise of a public duty; is guilty of the offence of forgery. So to recap this afternoon: Brian Houston \u201cgenuinely\u201d doesn\u2019t know if he was on a list put forward by Scott Morrison\u2019s office to attend the White House state dinner, despite having originally calling the Wall Street Journal story incorrect. He says he hasn\u2019t spoken to the prime minister about it. Labor will be referring the Angus Taylor document matter to the NSW police in the next 24 hours, if the government doesn\u2019t do it. The joint parliamentary committee into intelligence and security has told the government, for the first time since 2002, it needs to re-draft a bill. A bit more from pastor Brian Houston on 2GB Radio. Houston said he was contacted by the Wall Street Journal three weeks before the state dinner. He was \u201cconfused\u201d by the suggestion he may have been invited and said \u201cno, it\u2019s incorrect\u201d. But now Houston says he \u201cgenuinely [doesn\u2019t] know\u201d if Scott Morrison tried to get him invited. He agreed that \u2013 as far as he knows \u2013 Morrison has never ruled out that the story is true. Houston: \u201cI just didn\u2019t believe it. But then I guess the fact I didn\u2019t know anything about it doesn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s a question for Scott Morrison. I haven\u2019t talked to him about it \u2013 before or since the state dinner.\u201d Asked why he hadn\u2019t asked Morrison since the story broke \u2013 even if just out of curiosity \u2013 Houston responded that he figured Morrison had \u201ca whole lot more important things\u201d to deal with, such as the drought. So by his own version of events: Houston has gone on a journey from being sure the story wasn\u2019t true, to not so sure, but he hasn\u2019t spoken to the PM about it. Question: You said that in the absence of the prime minister or Taylor referring this to the NSW police that Labor would be writing, so does this mean you are writing or you\u2019re going to give the government more time to refer themselves? Mark Butler: We thought, particularly since the principle was set out at the beginning of the week that no one is above the law, that when the evidence was laid out in the way we try to do in question time and a number of media organisations have done in the last 24 hours, that he promised he would put that principle into action to practise and show and demonstrate that even one of his cabinet ministers would be subject to the law under his doctrine, he is all talk and no action. The ABC cuts away \u2013 but Labor will be writing to the NSW police in the next 24 hours. Question: Do you think or are you suggesting he [Angus Taylor] forged it himself? Mark Burler: We are making no suggestion at the moment, we gave him many opportunities to clarify and all he would do was deny the clearly obvious thing which is the document is a forgery. It is a very serious forgery because it is a document made with the intent to exercise the operation of a public duty, the exercise of a public duty by a publicly elected official. Angus Taylor will not say whether or not it was made by him or his office or provided by someone else to him. Instead, he tries to pretend this is not a forged document when all the evidence is to the contrary. Mark Butler is now holding a press conference on Angus Taylor: Today, the city of Sydney has released metadata log information that confirms the actual report which was uploaded almost 12 months ago, has not been altered once on the City of Sydney Council\u2019s website since that time. It is quite clear that Angus Taylor was working with a different document. The document he provided the Daily Telegraph has different formatting, different spacing and different font as well as obviously very different numbers. The New South Wales crimes act provides that the making of a forged document that is intended to influence the exercise of a public duty by a publicly elected official, like the lord mayor of Sydney, is a serious indictable offence punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It is also clear that the NSW crimes act provides that a failure to make a report about such a document to the NSW police is also a criminal offence, punishable by up to two years in prison after a person becomes aware of the forgery. Now, the circumstances surrounding Minister Angus Taylor could not be clearer, could not be clearer. He refused today during question time to do what the City of Sydney has done and release metadata logs that back up his claim that he downloaded that document from the city of Sydney website. It is a claim that just does not stand up to scrutiny and for which he will not provide any evidence. At the beginning of this week, the prime minister made it clear that no one was above the law. A very important statement, given there are a number of journalists in this building that are currently subject to prosecution for doing this job. But the prime minister is sitting on his hands while this tailor-made scandal about Angus Taylor continues to unfold and get deeper and deeper. Today it is quite clear that Angus Taylor has refused or declined to make a report himself to the NSW police, the prime minister is clearly not intending to make a referral himself to the NSW police and in the absence of any action by this government to clear this up and ensure that the public has the right to know what has happened here, the Labor party, through the shadow attorney general will be writing to the NSW police, seeking an investigation about all the circumstances surrounding this matter. Brian Houston tells Ben Fordham he has not spoken to the prime minister about whether or not his name was put forward for the White House dinner, as he thinks he has \u201cmore important things\u201d to worry about. Brian Houston says it is \u201cpossible\u201d that Scott Morrison\u2019s office put his name forward, but he didn\u2019t have any conversation with the prime minister about it and was \u201cconfused\u201d when the Wall Street Journal reported the news, because he had not heard anything about it. On the White House dinner invite, Brian Houston says he has known Scott Morrison \u201cwell before he was in politics\u201d. Houston says he has only received a short message from Morrison saying \u201cpray for Jen\u201d after he became prime minister, that Morrison only appeared at his conference and they had a coffee and that was about it. \u201cIt was news to me,\u201d Houston says of the White House dinner \u2013 he says it was the \u201cfirst\u201d he had heard of it. Brian Houston acknowledges he would still be under investigation by NSW police over failing to report his father Frank Houston\u2019s sexual abuse of children, as the case remains open. That was first reported by Samantha Maiden at The New Daily The most recent questioning on Brian Houston\u2019s invitation (and if it existed or not) was during estimates: Morrison has refused for weeks to answer repeated questions from journalists and in parliament about whether he tried to get one of his religious mentors on the guest list for the invitation-only Rose Garden soireebut was ultimately thwarted by the White House. That development \u2013 never denied by the prime minister \u2013 was revealed first by the Wall Street Journal while the prime minister was on his American visit. A riled Wong told the hearing: \u201cI think the public has a right to know whether our prime minister asked for Mr Brian Houston to go to the White House.\u201d She declared Morrison should be \u201cfrankly man enough and brave enough to answer the question\u201d. Departmental officials told the hearing they had not supplied any suggestions to the White House for guests for the state dinner, but declined to answer whether or not Morrison\u2019s office had made suggestions, offering a formulation about answers being potentially prejudicial. Brian Houston is about to appear on Sydney radio 2GB. That\u2019s over whether he was invited to attend the state dinner at the White House. Scott Morrison won\u2019t answer, so let\u2019s see what Houston has to say. That\u2019s it though \u2013 question time ends. The House won\u2019t sit again until November 25. One more dixer. Phil Thompson gets it. It\u2019s all on the secure and stable plan. This is so the government gets to finish off the week (and month) with the last say. Warren Entsch, Phil Thompson and Angie Bell make a bee line for the front bench in the final division. It\u2019s a Queensland incursion. \u201cThe most accident prone minister of his generation,\u201d Richard Marles gets in, before he is cut off. The last division is happening, but the folders are stacked, so I don\u2019t even think there will be another dixer after this. The folders are being stacked. In news that will shock no one, the government has not given leave to suspend standing orders and the house divides. Tony Burke: We need to know whether the forgery was tailor-made, because it looks exactly like that. The motion in full. I seek leave to move the following motion \u2013 that the House: notes: the Prime Minister\u2019s statement in the House on Monday this week that \u2018Whether they\u2019re politicians, journalists, public officials, anyone \u2014 there is no one in this country who is above the law\u2019; the reported provision of a forged document to the Daily Telegraph by the Minister for Emissions Reduction in an attempt to influence the public duty of the lord mayor of Sydney; the creation and/or knowing use of a forged document in attempt to influence a public duty is a serious indictable offence under New South Wales law punishable by up to 10 years in prison; the failure to report knowledge of a serious indictable offence is also an offence under NSW law punishable by up to two years in prison; the Minister for Emissions Reduction has failed to explain his role in, or knowledge of, the creation and/or use of a forged document used in an attempt to influence the public duty of the lord mayor of Sydney; and the minister has refused to give straight answers to simple questions about these crimes, as if the public has no right to know; and having regard to the foregoing, calls on the prime minister to ask the NSW Police to investigate whether the Minister for Emissions Reduction has committed a crime.\u201d Once this motion fails, there won\u2019t be another opportunity to ask Angus Taylor about this, in parliament, for a month. Labor is now seeking to move a motion against Angus Taylor. Angus Taylor: I absolutely reject the premise of the question. Those opposite will believe anything they read on their favourite website, Mr Speaker. Now, the truth is that the Member for Hindmarsh wants to distract from his woes, from the open hostility between his and his colleagues. They are all smear and no idea. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: There is an offence for failing to bring information about the condition of a forgery designed to influence public duty, to the attention of the New South Wales police force. Has the minister reported this matter to the NSW Police or does he still seriously claim that the document he provided to the Daily Telegraph is not a forgery? If he does make that claim will he provide meta data to support it as the city of Sydney has?\u201d Christian Porter steps in. The first question went to, any subsequent question went to the origins of a document. The minister has been absolutely straight in his answers with respect to the origins ... It may not have been the answer that members wanted, but the answer was provided. Now they ask a question which infers and imputes that an offence has been created or, indeed, then ask the minister, with respect to that which is not at all proven and not at all clear. Tony Burke: The question is effectively in three parts. The first describes an offence, the second asks whether the minister has reported it, and the third asks situations whether the minister is in fact claiming this would happen, in which case, an offence would not have been committed. So none of the imputations that the Leader of the House just refer to a meeting the question. Tony Smith allows the question. Peter Dutton is now saying Labor introduced the medevac legislation, which Anthony Albanese pulls him up on. \u201cIntroduced by Labor?\u201d he yells across the table. \u201cAbsolutely introduced and supported by Labor,\u201d Dutton says. Medevac was introduced by independent Kerryn Phelps, and supported and seconded by the crossbench. After Peter Dutton was pulled up yesterday for attacking Labor, without talking about the government\u2019s policy (launching straight into the \u201calternative approaches\u201d) Dutton now has a dixer which is ONLY alternative approaches. Minister, what are the risks of alternative approaches to the Morrison government\u2019s well-known stable and secure approach to border protection policies?\u201d Tony Smith steps in immediately: Obviously I\u2019ve made my position clear yesterday on the content of answers. And I\u2019m not in a position, obviously, to know what the minister is going to say. But I have a fair idea. I will say to the minister that the House of Representatives practice and standing orders are very clear. I think the question is cleverly written and is in order, but it is the answer I will be focusing on. And I\u2019m not going to allow questions. I\u2019m just saying this and they make this point about House of Representatives practice. In fact, you may as well take a seat. I will make this point. The standing orders make it clear that ministers can only be questioned about matters for which they are responsible. And they say, in all seriousness, the government is very keen to enforce that when it gets questions from the opposition about matters for which they are not responsible. The practice makes it very clear that some speakers have had a very strict approach and indeed not even allowed taglines like \u201calternative policies\u201d. I have been more liberal. I have been more liberal.(\u201cThat\u2019s been the problem,\u201d Ed Husic laughs) But there has never been a time when an entire answer can be about an opposition\u2019s policy. The question is, as I said, cleverly written and in order, but for the minister to be in order in his answer he needs to take the approach that I have been allowing. I will let him have a go.\u201d Dutton gets back to the despatch box with a big smile. \u201cHe\u2019s been practising,\u201d Husic yells. After 40 seconds, he is into how terrible he believes Labor\u2019s approaches to be. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Does the minister stand by his claim that he downloaded the document from the City of Sydney\u2019s website in light of information released today by the city that metadata logs proved conclusively that the original documents had not been altered since being uploaded to their website almost 12 months ago? (From the Liberal backbench \u2018that is not what it says\u2019) Taylor: \u201cAs I say again, I am advised that document ... Labor very loudly \u2018oooooooghhhhhhhhhh\u2019 at the \u2018I am advised\u2019 Taylor continues: The document was drawn from the City of Sydney website and it was publicly available. I reject the bizarre suggestions and assertions being peddled by those opposite. From Anne Davies and Christopher Knaus\u2019s story: Emails between the council and the Telegraph show that Taylor\u2019s office said it downloaded its erroneous document from the council\u2019s website on 6 September 2019. But the council has now provided evidence to the Guardian that it had not altered the publicly available version of its annual report at any point since it was uploaded with the correct figures in November 2018. That evidence includes emailed advice from its IT department and screenshots of its content management system. \u201cMetadata logs prove that the City\u2019s annual report documents, both PDF and Word versions, were uploaded on 27 November 2018 and not updated after that date,\u201d a council spokesman said. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer the minister to his previous answer. Where did he get the document? Taylor: The document was drawn directly, from the City of Sydney\u2019s website.\u201d Mark Coulton is taking a dixer, reminding me of his existence, so I suppose they serve some purpose. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: \u201cI refer to the minister\u2019s previous answer \u2013 where did the minister get the forged document?\u201d Taylor: I absolutely reject the premise of the question and the bizarre assertions being peddled by those opposite. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: My question is to the minister of emissions reduction. Section 253 of the New South Wales crimes act creates a serious offence for making a false document to influence the exercise of a public duty. I refer to his provision of a forged City of Sydney document in the Daily Telegraph in an attempt to influence the Lord Mayor of Sydney in exercise of her public duty. Will he administer to this house that this forgery was not made by him or his office? Taylor: Yes. (That\u2019s the whole answer) Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. And I refer to his comments in this parliament on Monday, when the prime minister told the house that the following, quote, \u201cWhether they are politicians, journalists, public officials, anyone, there is no one in this country who was above the law\u201d. Does he apply the standard to his own ministers? Morrison: \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly obvious answer to that question. No one is above the law in this country. David Smith to Scott Morrison: Is the real reason the Prime Minister obsesses about Labor, because he wants to distract Australians from the fact that net government debt has more than doubled on his watch? Morrison: Net debt under this government now is coming down. (It more than doubled, Jim Chalmers yells) We are in surplus this year, Mr Speaker. And it\u2019s been a long time ... It has been a long time since we have been in surplus and after six painstaking years of getting the budget back into shape, getting spending under control, conservatively budgeting on their forecasts on revenue and ensuring we are getting Australians back into work so they are going off welfare and they are paying taxes, the budget is now in surplus this year and that means that debt ... is coming down as the budget was a by $50bn over the forward estimates. They will tell you why I\u2019d talk about Labor, Mr Speaker, because they don\u2019t think we should ever return to the reckless policies of the Labor party when it comes to budget and any other things, Mr Speaker. Australians know the mistakes that Labor made when they were last in power and the reason we are talking about them again is because the shadow treasurer wants those policies reintroduced by Mr Speaker. In that wonderful book which the treasurer quotes, glory days, Mr Speaker, he talked about ... He asked me about Labor! Anthony Albanese calls him up on relevance, but the question includes Labor, so it is allowed. Morrison: So in Glory Days, the shadow treasurer was talking about his glory days as the chief of staff to Wayne Swan. He said the chief of staff was my job. It was tremendous \u2013 worth the greying hair and expanding waistline. All at once you are the key advisor and confidant to the Treasurer. This requires a closeness with the boss and the ability to know his mind without even speaking to him about every issue. He was at one with Obi ... Swan, Mr Speaker. And as he listens to the [leader] of the time, Kevin Rudd, all he can hear is \u201cHigher taxes, he must, higher taxes, you must\u201d. This recklessness is because on our watch we will put in place for stable and certain fiscal matters. We will not return to the policies of panic and crisis of the Labor Party, which Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd champion, Mr Speaker.\u201d The Liberal backbench goes mental at this Star Wars reference, but jokes on them, because Obi Wan didn\u2019t speak like that, Yoda, who trained Obi Wan, did. Ugh. Fakers. Also, Han shot first. Don\u2019t @ me. A lot of MPs are wearing red ribbons ahead of Day for Daniel tomorrow, the child safety charity set up by Daniel Morcombe\u2019s parents, Bruce and Denise. Josh Frydenberg does not say yes: Mr Speaker, we\u2019re not going to take a lecture from the Labor party, a lecture from the Labor party that delivered $240*bn of accumulated deficit. Do you remember the four budget surpluses that the Member for Lilley, Wayne Swan ... ... The reality is, Mr Speaker, we are paying that back, Mr Speaker and we are doing that by growing the economy. And what we will never do is we will never whack the Australian people with $387bn of higher [taxes]. *original post had $204bn. I blame tveeder, but would remind the member that not yelling into the microphone, makes the transcription easier. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Is the real reason the treasurer always bangs on endlessly about Labor because he wants to distract Australians from the fact he has presided over higher household debt and business debt than any other treasurer in the history of this country?\u201d \u201cJust say yes, the answer is yes,\u201d Ed Husic calls out. Labor cheers as Josh Frydenberg gets to the \u201cI\u2019m asked about alternative approaches\u201d part of this lickspittle. \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed. You\u2019ve got issues,\u201d Jim Chalmers yells. At the moment, the rugby field is as hard as this dispatch box, but thanks to their $1m drought community support program, it will be green as the leather on the chairs we are sitting on, and that is a great thing. These drought stricken communities want to see us talking about them, not about each other.\u201d Michael McCormack, on how drought-stricken communities want politicians to talk about their communities, not each other, straight after using a drought analogy using parliamentary chamber furniture. You just know he is the sort of passenger who reads out every sign the car passes. YOU JUST KNOW Joel Fitzgibbon to Scott Morrison: Who is running the government\u2019s chaotic drought response? The prime minister or the National party backbench? Morrison: The cabinet. Michael McCormack is still talking. It\u2019s like watching jelly melt in a slow cooker. Michael McCormack says he \u201cthought it was my national party colleagues cheering me on\u201d. The prime minister and him then turn to the Nats, and they all cheer. The protesters are talking about \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d brought on by the drought, as well as \u201cpeople are dying\u201d. But sure. Sounds like a cheer squad. A climate protester is being removed from the gallery. There\u2019s a series of them \u2013 the third or fourth is being removed now. First mention of \u201cpanic and crisis policies of the Labor party\u201d. Point of order \u2013 the Labor party don\u2019t actually have any policies. They are all under review. Also, stop trying to make fetch happen. It\u2019s a short one to start off with. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Is the reason his government won\u2019t commit to a bipartisan approach with Labor on the drought because he cannot even manage a bipartisan approach with the National Party? Morrison: \u201cNo.\u201d I appreciate the brevity. I wish that same brevity was applied to this latest \u201chow amazing is the economy and this government\u201d dixer. There really needs to be a moratorium on \u201calternative approaches\u201d. Christian Porter gets walking in privileges with Scott Morrison today. It\u2019s the last question time for a month (senate QT doesn\u2019t really count, sorry not sorry) We are heading into the chamber for what, I am sure, will be the Angus Taylor hour. Because how could it not be. Here is a bit of where Chris Bowen is going on the Greg Hunt attack: Under questioning from the Labor party last night the department confirmed that in fact only 227 new medicines have been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on this Government\u2019s watch. 1,354 listings were at no cost to government. So every time Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt say \u2018we can only list this medicine because of the strong budget\u2019 the truth is the listings were made at zero impact on the budget and 316 listings have actually just been price changes for normal business of Government. Greg Hunt says he\u2019s listed 2,200 medicines in fact it\u2019s 227, around 10 per cent of what he claimed. 10 per cent of what he said. 10 per cent of what Scott Morrison boasts about. Facebook is still grappling with what role it plays in monitoring election misinformation which is being put on its platform. Australia was dragged into that in May. The US is dealing with it once again. Andrew Leigh says more needs to be done: In the most recent election, Facebook was used as a platform to disseminate misinformation by not only political parties, but also actors associated with them. Australians should be able to see what political advertisements are being run on these platforms. Australians have a right to know what misinformation is being propagated. Facebook should not allow itself to become a platform for propagating mistruths. Politics should be a contest of ideas, not a war of falsehoods. I call on Facebook and other social media platforms to do the right thing. Anne Davies and Christopher Knaus have new information on one of the weirdest stories of the year so far: The City of Sydney has produced evidence to back up its insistence that it never altered a document to introduce the false figures used by Angus Taylor in an attack on the lord mayor over her travel-related emissions. The evidence places further pressure on the office of the energy minister to explain how the false figures came to be in the document he used to launch the extraordinary attack on Clover Moore last month. On Thursday Taylor labelled the affair a \u201cconspiracy theory being perpetrated by the lord mayor\u201d and accused her of \u201chollow virtue-signalling\u201d on emissions. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that Taylor sent Moore a letter, which was received on 30 September, criticising what he said was a $15m travel bill during 2017-18 and suggesting she could reduce the council\u2019s carbon emissions by cutting down on international travel. Right. After the flurry of the morning, it is now the dead zone before question time. To recap, the bipartisan joint committee on intelligence and security cannot tick off on a government surveillance bill, and has sent it back to be withdrawn. It\u2019s the first time since 2002 it has taken this step. The government doesn\u2019t have to do it but it probably will, because to ignore this sort of response would be a pretty big deal which would have ongoing ramifications. Angus Taylor will have a lot of questions to answer over how his office came to have vastly different travel costs for the City of Sydney council, which were provided to a News Corp journalist. And we are finally getting some answers on Australia\u2019s involvement in the William Barr investigation into the Mueller report \u2013 which we are involved in because of Alexander Downer. From AAP: Private schools will be able to spend $1.2bn of taxpayer funds however they see fit, regardless of how much money they rake in from fees and donations. Education bureaucrats told senators on Thursday they would have no role in assessing applications for money from the special fund, set up in a side deal with Catholic and independent schools a year ago to ease their transition to new funding arrangements. The department will publish guidelines for the funds but it will be up to the Catholic Education Commission and associations of independent schools in each state and territory to dole them out. \u201cThe department itself won\u2019t be assessing any applications for funding under the fund,\u201d deputy secretary Alex Gordon told the estimates committee hearing in Canberra. The guidelines will set out the kinds of priorities the funds should be used for, but won\u2019t set eligibility for individual schools. And Joel Fitzgibbon has responded to the Nationals backbench drought plan: The National Party backbench hasn\u2019t produced a national drought plan, just a plan to save the Nationals,\u201d he said The Nationals are in revolt within the Coalition because the prime minister doesn\u2019t have a drought plan.\u201d Chris Bowen is starting to speak up a lot more in his new shadow portfolio (health) He just held a press conference on this: Last night in Senate Estimates the department confirmed, out of the 2200 medicines the minister claims to have listed on the PBS, only 1 in 10 of those represents a new medicine. In an exchange with Senator Murray Watt, the department confirmed, since 2013 only 227 new medicines have been listed by the Abbott, Turnbull, and Morrison Governments. Department of Health Official: \u201cNew PBS listings which mean a brand new molecule listed for the first time on the PBS or listed for the first time as a new indication, 227.\u201d And last night in Senate Estimates the Department of Health confirmed out of the 2200 medicines the minister claims to have listed, 316 are actually just price changes, and 1354 listings were at no cost to government at all. Department of Health Official: \u201cPrice changes, 316. And we have a number of listings that are all with nil financial cost, 1,354.\u201d This government has been misleading Australians on how many affordable medicines they have listed on the PBS. Greg Hunt claims improving access to medicines is one of his four pillars of health. Over in the house, the education amendment which deals with the state funding allocations Shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones and shadow cabinet secretary Jenny McAllister have gone on the attack over the \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d revelation Michael Sukkar\u2019s office had input into the ABS decision not to ask about gender and sexuality in the census test: \u201cAustralians should feel let down that their government are more interested in playing politics than doing the job Australians expect and deserve. \u201cThe minister\u2019s objection to a community or their sexual orientation is no reason to refuse to collect import information to help guide government service delivery. \u201cEven after years of progress, there are still significant health and wellbeing disparities that effect Australia\u2019s LGBTI community. \u201cLGBTI Australians have been ignored in Australian policy planning for too long. \u201cAll Australians deserve to be counted in the census.\u201d Another piece of legislation has been sent to vibe in the senate, waiting for it to reconvene Back to estimates. DFAT officials are reluctant to provide an immediate answer about how many meetings there have been with the Barr investigation. Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong has counted four referenced in evidence this morning. Have there been more than four? Officials want to take it on notice to ensure the answer is accurate. Wong wants an answer today. Officials signal that\u2019s likely possible. Wong says she believes that she\u2019s being reasonable. Marise Payne accepts Wong\u2019s professed reasonableness, but she still doesn\u2019t intend to answer the questions. Oh, hang on, here are a couple of straight answers. Payne says she has not discussed the Barr inquiry with Alexander Downer and neither has Scott Morrison \u201cto my knowledge\u201d. DFAT secretary Frances Adamson says she has. But now we are back to the brick wall. No-one will answer a question about whether Downer reported his insights about possible Russian intelligence on Hillary Clinton to his American counterpart in London. (I reported a few weeks ago Downer did have a conversation with his American diplomatic counterpart in London, and he did that without reference to senior colleagues in Canberra.) Wong asks Payne whether she has confidence that Downer acted appropriately. \u201cYes senator,\u201d the foreign minister says. In general terms, Adamson says diplomats in the Australian service are allowed to interact with their colleagues in foreign services without seeking permission. The DFAT secretary stresses she is not speaking about any particular head of mission. Back to mysteries Back to DFAT, officials will not answer a question about whether Australia has handed over diplomatic cables to the Barr investigation. They say it would be prejudicial to answer that question, given the ongoing inquiry, and the backdrop of foreign relations. DFAT secretary Frances Adamson says Australia is working to assist the Barr inquiry in Australia\u2019s national interest. Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong says she doesn\u2019t really understand that answer. She wants to know who makes the decision about what is in Australia\u2019s national interest. Wong wants to know what decisions Marise Payne has made. Have you made any decision to release material, Wong wonders? Payne says it\u2019s not appropriate to provide a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on these matters. Wong asks whether Alexander Downer is getting support from the government, either legal or financial, and hits a brick wall. Officials tell her they can\u2019t answer. \u201cWhy is that a secret?\u201d Wong asks. \u201cThis is public money. This really is overly secretive.\u201d Payne says, \u201cWe are dealing with an active investigation in the United States.\u201d The foreign minister says the inquiry is the sensitivity, so she can\u2019t answer. Wong defaults to sarcasm. \u201cNobody understood that,\u201d she says. Wong is not happy. DFAT secretary Frances Adamson has just told estimates she is the Australian government\u2019s point of contact for the Barr inquiry, as well as Joe Hockey. This has been a mystery up until this moment. Officials from PMC declined to answer this question on Monday. Adamson also explains that Donald Trump called Scott Morrison ahead of the US visit to request a point of contact for the Barr inquiry because Hockey was away at the time. Another mystery solved this morning. Adamson says she\u2019s had one meeting with William Barr, on September 21 (which is I think when we were in the US on the Trump visit, but will need to check). Worth noting that Amanda Stoker is engaged in a Senate ticket battle with James McGrath at the moment \u2013 Matt Canavan has one of the two spots and unless he makes the jump to the house, either Stoker or McGrath will miss out. Even if Canavan does decide the grass, as well as the carpet, is greener on the other side (there are a couple of safe LNP central seats he could move to, if so inclined and the branch was onside) it is still a Nationals spot, so there would need to be more negotiations. Either way, right now there is one Liberal LNP spot on the top of the ticket and Stoker and McGrath are fighting for it. Stoker has certainly stepped up her profile in recent months and shows no signs of slowing down. In the end, she only needs the LNP members to pay attention, and quite a few in central and north Queensland eat this up. Expect to hear this sort of thing a lot more often from the prime minister and others so inclined, during their introductions. Scott Morrison last night: Can I also acknowledge the Ngunnawal people tonight, their elders past and present, and future, can I acknowledge if there are any members of the Australian Defence Forces here tonight, any veterans who may be with us and simply say to you on behalf of a very grateful nation, thank you very very much for your service. And our migration community over generations have made up those numbers certainly, those who\u2019ve served in uniform to defend the very country that they\u2019ve come to call home. And so particularly tonight, those members of our defence forces those who\u2019ve served, as veterans, who\u2019ve come from other places and called, not only this nation home. But then turned up to defend it as well in our uniform. In the midst of the temporary exclusion order debate (where the government refused to accept all of the committee\u2019s recommendations, a rare slip of bipartisanship with this committee), Peter Dutton had this to say about Mark Dreyfus on ABC radio on July 24: He has watered down pieces of legislation to a point where they can become ineffective, and we\u2019re not going to tolerate that any longer. We will accept the recommendations from the committee where they are in a national interest to do so.\u201d In parliament, the day before that AM interview, Dutton had said this: We are going to work with the committee. We will look at the recommendations made by the committee in relation to the relevant legislation that they might explore, and we will ultimately decide, in our country\u2019s interests, in an attempt to keep Australians safe, which of those recommendations we accept. Ultimately, the government has been elected on a mandate to provide legislation to this parliament to protect Australians from a very real threat.\u201d Given the government did not take on all of the committee\u2019s recommendations then (something Labor had also done once while in government) there were fears that the PJCIS would be treated \u201cjust like any other committee\u201d so the government response to this will be interesting. Australian Bureau of Statistics chief David Kalisch has just given evidence that 20,000 census tests containing questions on gender and sexuality were printed but not used after input from the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar\u2019s office. Under questioning from Labor, Kalisch acknowledged that the gender and sexuality questions were among eight that were shortlisted as possible inclusions in the 2021 census, but were not used in the census test conducted in Wagga Wagga and Logan in mid-October. Kalisch told Senate Estimates the ABS printed 40,000 forms for the test: 20,000 with the gender and sexuality questions (Form A); and 20,000 without (Form B). Only Form B was put into the field. Asked if he had any communication with the prime minister, Sukkar or their offices, he replied \u2013 no contact with Scott Morrison or his office, no contact with Sukkar but: I have had some conversations with the minister\u2019s office about helping them understand the nature of the consideration around the decision.\u201d Asked if Sukkar\u2019s office sought to influence which questions were used, he said, \u201cThey put a view to me but ultimately it was my decision.\u201d Kalisch then tried to avoid questions about what view Sukkar\u2019s staff had put to him, claiming \u201cthey did not provide any guidance about what should be on or off the [test] form\u201d, before conceding \u201cthey did express a preference but ultimately it was my call\u201d. Asked if the preference was to exclude gender and sexuality questions, he replied: They were contemplating what response they would make around census topics, and didn\u2019t want the census test to pre-empt that decision.\u201d Joe Hockey leans in to the Barr inquiry without an official request DFAT estimates is now onto the Barr inquiry (which is Donald Trump\u2019s effort to discredit the Mueller inquiry). The evidence from officials is Joe Hockey, Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington, offered to participate in the Barr inquiry without the Americans asking. The officials say it was Hockey\u2019s advice to signal that cooperation (he did flag the idea with the foreign minister Marise Payne prior to sending his letter), and he met subsequently with William Barr, alone, to discuss the inquiry. Officials say there is a readout of that Hockey/Barr conversation, but they don\u2019t intend to share it with the estimates committee. DFAT secretary Frances Adamson says Hockey reiterated Australia\u2019s willingness to cooperate. She won\u2019t answer whether Barr requested any detailed information from Australia. If you\u2019ve forgotten all this, Australia has agreed to participate in the Barr inquiry (even though it is clearly a partisan exercise) because our former high commissioner in London, Alexander Downer, reported the existence of possible Russian intelligence on Hillary Clinton after a meeting with a Trump aide, George Papadopolous when Trump was running for the presidency. Trump rang Scott Morrison prior to his recent visit to Washington to establish who was the point of contact in Australia for the Barr investigation. Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong has signalled there will be a lot of questions on this issue this morning. Kristina Keneally has responded to the intelligence and security decision not to recommend passing the ID matching bill: Today the PJCIS tabled a report declining to recommend the passage of the current Identity Matching Services Bill \u2013 in any form. Instead, Labor and Liberal members of the committee are uniting to recommend that the Identity-matching Services Bill be completely re-drafted and referred back to the Intelligence and Security Committee for a further inquiry. The committee has concerns about privacy, transparency, reporting and oversight and does not consider that the bill in its current form can be amended, but rather that it should be completely re-drafted. A distinct lack of politics there, as both parties (so far) embrace the bipartisan nature of the PJCIS, which is meant to be above politics. Given it involves Peter Dutton, let\u2019s see how long that lasts. The Greens are picking up on the Anne Davies and Christopher Knaus story involving doctored documents, and will be holding a press conference on it a little later today. It seems to be the first time since 2002 that this committee, one of the most powerful in the parliament, has recommended a bill be re-drawn (that was about questioning and warrant powers in the wake of September 11) and then referred back. Usually it just recommends changes to amend the bill, which the government of the day largely \u2013 temporary exclusion order aside (not all of those were adopted in full, which created a pretty big kerfuffle) but it is very, very rare for the committee to just say \u2013 start again. Mark Dreyfus: Like my colleagues on the committee, I do not believe that the government is proposing to engage in or to facilitate the mass surveillance of Australians. But I do accept that, given the near complete absence of legislated safeguards in the Identity-Matching Services Bill 2019, those concerns cannot simply be ignored. If there is no intention for the proposed identity-matching services to be used to engage in mass surveillance activities, the government should not object to amending the bill to ensure that those services cannot, as a matter of law, be used in that manner. Concerns were also raised about the proposed one-to-many identity-matching service being used to identify people who are engaging in protest activity. This does concern me. It was only this month that the Minister for Home Affairs, the minister responsible for this very bill, called for mandatory prison sentences for people who engage in protest activity; called for the same people to have their welfare payments cancelled; and also called for them to be photographed and publicly shamed. As presently drafted, this bill would not prohibit authorities from using the proposed face-matching services to identify individuals in a crowd who are engaging in lawful protest activity. That would be concerning in the best of times; it is particularly concerning in the light of the authoritarian disposition of the Minister for Home Affairs. A raft of other concerns was expressed about the Identity-Matching Services Bill, including in relation to this government\u2019s abysmal record on cybersecurity. I do not propose to list all of the concerns here today, but I encourage everyone to read about them in the committee\u2019s report. I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee, Labor and Liberal, for their work on this important report. It should not escape anyone watching these proceedings today that, by agreeing to the set of recommendations contained in this report, the Liberal members of the committee have placed the national interest first. For that, I would like to pay tribute to Senators Stoker, Fawcett and Abetz, and the members for Canning, Berowra and Goldstein. I would like to pay particular tribute and extend my thanks to the chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, the member for Canning. I also thank the committee secretariat for their excellent work, both in this parliament and in the last parliament, which underpins this report. Andrew Hastie: The committee also simultaneously examined the Australian Passports Amendment (Identity-matching Services) Bill 2019. The passport bill proposes amendments to the Australian Passports Act 2005 which would authorise the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to disclose information in order to participate in identity-matching services and provides for computerised decision-making in confirming identity. This bill would also support the objectives of the IMS bill by making Australian travel document data available to identity-matching services by the interoperability hub. Again, submitters supported the broad objectives of this bill. Few objections were raised but there were some concerns regarding the use of automated decision-making, in particular where unfavourable outcomes were made for the subject. Most felt that an element of human decision-making should be kept and avenues for review of decisions should be implicitly incorporated into the bill. The committee agrees and recommends that the bill should be amended to ensure automated decision-making can only be used for decisions that produce favourable or neutral outcomes for the subject and that automated decisions should not ... affect outcomes. The committee recognises redrafting of the identity-matching services bill 2019 may have consequential effects to the passports bill. Should this occur this, this report also recommends that the amended passports bill also be referred to the committee for further review. I want to reiterate the importance of the objectives of these bills and that these objectives have the committee\u2019s full support. Wanting to ensure the safety and security of all Australians is something we have in common but we also need to protect citizens\u2019 rights while doing so. Basically, the bill, as drafted, would allow the government to follow you around as you went about your day. It seems we have finally found a bipartisan line MPs don\u2019t want crossed. Mark Dreyfus, as the most senior Labor member on the committee, also commented on the bill: The Intelligence and Security Committee of the Parliament is declining to recommend the passage of the identity matching services bill. Instead, Labor and Liberal members of the committee are uniting to recommend that the identity matches services bill be completely redrafted and referred back to the Intelligence and Security Committee for further inquiry when it is reintroduced. In taking this step, I congratulate all members of the committee for putting the national interest first and sending a strong message about the value of this committee. The identity matching services bill purports to facilitate the exchange of identity information pursuant to the objective of an intergovernmental agreement reached by Coag [in] October 2017. But it includes none of the limitations or safeguards anticipated by that agreement. The bill includes almost no limitations or safeguards at all. As explained in the committee\u2019s report, the identity matching services bill would authorise the Department of Home Affairs to create and maintain facilities for the sharing of facial images and other identity information between government agencies and in some cases, non government agencies entities. The bill would also authorised the Department of Home Affairs to develop and maintain to centralised facilities for the provision of what are called identity matching services. The first of these two facilities would be called an interoperability hub. The Hub would act as a router through which government agencies across Australia could request and transmit information as part of an identity matching service. The second would be a federated database of information contained in government identity documents. As discussed in the committee\u2019s report, the potential implications of these two new facilities for the privacy of all Australians are profound. Those implications do not appear to have even been considered by the Minister for Home Affairs or by his department. While a bill provides for six different identity mentioned services, the service that elicited the most concerned from submitters to the committee\u2019s inquiry is the face of identification service. That service would enable authorities across Australia to use huge databases of facial images to determine the identity of an unknown person. Using that service, a law enforcement agency could submit a facial image for matching against a database of facial images contained in a in government identification documents, such as a database containing every driver licence photo in Australia. In return, the agency would receive a small number of matching or near matching facial images from the database. The agency could then access biographical information associated with those images. The potential for such a service to be used for mass or blanket surveillance, such as CCTV being used to identify Australians going about their business in real time was raised by numerous submitters to the inquiry. In September Guardian Australia reported on Labor and union outrage about the social media posts of a Coalition-appointed deputy president of the Fair Work Commission, Gerard Boyce. In a series of social media posts Boyce: Said it was \u201cdefinitely time\u201d for Labor to conduct a review, after losing the 2019 election Described the unions\u2019 election campaign as a \u201cbig waste of money\u201d; and Days after the 18 May election loss, posted an article from the West Australian arguing that Labor had botched the \u201cunloseable\u201d election with the observation \u201coooooooops!!\u201d AAP has this update from Senate Estimates on Wednesday night: Fair Work general manager Bernadette O\u2019Neill said all commission members had a code of conduct which included not engaging in political matters. She said the issue had been dealt with internally after Fair Work president Ian Ross spoke to Mr Boyce. \u201cThe member gave an undertaking not to engage in social media,\u201d Ms O\u2019Neill told a Senate hearing on Wednesday night. While the security committee boilover was proceeding in the House, DFAT estimates was focussed on the Uighurs. DFAT officials have told senators China has noted international concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang in the north west of the country, and feels it is \u201cunder the scrutiny of the international community\u201d. There is growing agitation about this issue among Australian MPs. Andrew Hastie (who played a starring role a minute ago in the House on the identity sharing bill) used an adjournment speech last night to declare he was troubled by the way that Uighurs culture and identity \u201cis being systematically assaulted, deconstructed and scrubbed out by authorities\u201d. Officials say the foreign minister Marise Payne has raised this issue with her Chinese counterpart directly on several occasions. Liberals are also expressing concerns in this hearing about Chinese students in Australia. Instances have been raised about people reporting on their remarks in educational and social settings which are then relayed back to their families in China. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong also asked for an update on Dr Yang, a writer and democratic activist detained in China. Officials say Australia has made it clear that Dr Yang should be treated fairly and transparently, and if he is being detained for his political reviews, he should be released. You can find the committee\u2019s report here Andrew Hastie, the chair of the joint intelligence and security parliamentary committee makes the first statement. He essentially says that while the committee supports the spirit of the bill, it gives home affairs too much surveillance power, with a lack of oversight into how they could use it. ... Many participants to this review express broad support for the underlying objectives and rationale the bill. For example, measures that aim to address identity related crime and enable law enforcement bodies to cooperate to achieve this objective. Statement such as this, were echoed throughout the evidence that the committee received. However, some participants rise with the committee and they to ensure appropriate governance and accountability and protection of the individual\u2019s right to privacy. The committee acknowledges these concerns and believes that while the bills explanatory memorandum sets out governance arrangements, such as existing and contemplated agreements and access policies that are not adequately set out in the current bill. In the committee\u2019s view, robust safeguards and appropriate oversight mechanisms should be explained clearly in the legislation. The committee expresses broad support for the objectives of the bill but agrees that the bill as it stands does not adequately incorporate enough detail. It is for this reason that the committee recommends that the identity matching services Bill 2019 be redrafted according to the following principles: One, the regime should be built around privacy, transparency and subject to safe to rather robust safeguards to the regime, two: the regime should be subject to parliamentary oversight, and reasonable proportionate and transparent functionality. Three, the regime should be one that requires annual reporting on the use of the identity matching services and four the primary legislation should specifically require that there is a participation agreement that sets out the obligations of all parties participating in the identity, identity matching services in detail. Additionally, the Committee recommends that the redrafted bill will be referred to the committee for further review. Both government and Labor MPs on the intelligence committee are united in recommending the identity sharing bill NOT be passed, because it appears to give home affairs too much power, without any oversight. Like I said, this is a BIG deal. Usually it\u2019s \u2018we think it can be fixed and here are our recommendations on how to do it\u2019 not \u2018DO NOT PASS THIS BILL\u2019. Andrew Hastie is speaking on that identity bill \u2013 he says the committee is recommending it be re-drafted. That\u2019s a big deal. A government led committee is saying a government bill does not have enough oversight. More to come. Over in Social Services estimates, Labor\u2019s Murray Watt has been grilling the department and the NDIA about the agency\u2019s chair, Helen Nugent, using a Macquarie Group email to conduct NDIS work. That was revealed in this story by Rick Morton here. Watt is concerned about potential conflicts of interest and privacy concerns. Macquarie is the only bank listed on a NDIA housing reference group. It is also reportedly eyeing investments in the specialist disability accommodation sector. The external email is outside the scope of FOI. It should be noted Nugent no longer has a formal role at Macquarie. Watt points to a story, in the AFR, that says Nugent received emails to her Macquarie account that contained \u201chighly sensitive case information on Tim Rubenach, a 32-year-old man with severe epilepsy who died in northeast Tasmania awaiting NDIS care\u201d. He asks if NDIA\u2019s acting CEO, Vicki Rundle, and the department are guilty of \u201cwilful blindness\u201d. They reject this. The DSS secretary, Kathryn Campbell, says Nugent had actively discouraged NDIA staff from contacting her using the external email. Rundle tells the hearing Nugent is \u201ccognisant\u201d of using her official NDIA email. But of any conflict of interests, she adds: \u201cI\u2019m trying to work out what the actual issue might be.\u201d Nugent has not been reprimanded or officially advised to refrain from using her Macquarie email for NDIS/NDIA work. They have taken on notice questions about how many NDIA-related emails she has sent and received using her Macquarie email. The head of the department of foreign affairs and trade, Frances Adamson, was asked about Australia\u2019s relationship with China, by Penny Wong, in estimates this morning. Here is the chief diplomat\u2019s view: Well, Australia\u2019s relationship with China in fact, I think across the world ... every country\u2019s relationship with China is a subject of keen interest and conversation across a wide range of stakeholders. And in that respect, Australia is no different particularly given the nature of our relationship with China. Of course, in formal terms, we have a comprehensive strategic partnership, but we very quickly then, within that, look at the various pillars of activity that we have, including obviously trading investment, people to people links, prominently captured by numbers of tourism and students, and all of those things. In broad diplomatic terms, though, Australia continues to engage with China, the prime minister had a good meeting at which I was present in Jakarta on the weekend with Vice President Wang Qishan. The foreign minister also had a very good meeting at which I was present in New York with her counterpart. Those meetings, it\u2019s important that they occur as regularly as they can, because they enable us to talk to each other about the nature of the relationship in all of its dimensions, including areas where we have differences. Those differences have been well publicised, not always accurately, but they exist and I think there\u2019s no point in us at all, pretending that they\u2019re not there. In fact, I think if we were to characterise our current relationship with China and the relationship going forward, it will be a relationship where we will need on both sides to work quite hard to manage what I really think will be enduring differences. Some points of difference may come and go and be able to be resolved. But other points of difference, which go more deeply to the differences between our systems and our values are likely to endure. It should therefore not be surprising in my view that a relationship where there are points of difference, some of them which are actively canvassed in the public domain, that is \u2013 I don\u2019t particularly like the term \u201cnew normal\u201d, but I think it does apply in this situation. That bill Andrew Hastie is about to report on has been quite controversial. Mostly because it creates a national ID register: 1. This Bill amends the Australian Passports Act 2005 (Passports Act) to provide a legal basis for ensuring that the minister is able to make Australian travel document data available for all the purposes of, and by the automated means intrinsic to, the identity-matching services to which the Commonwealth and the States and Territories agreed in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Identity Matching Services (IGA), signed at a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on 5 October 2017. 2. The services will enable identity matching based on personal information held in government systems nationally. They include a number of biometric services in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade intends to participate. One, the Face Verification Service (FVS), will allow Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, and potentially in future the private sector, to verify the known or claimed identities of individuals by reference to facial images in government identity records. Another, the Face Identification Service (FIS), will allow authorised facial recognition specialists in law enforcement, national security and anti-corruption agencies to identify unknown persons. Beyond the FVS and the FIS, an Identity Data Sharing Service will allow for the secure sharing of biometric identity information in other circumstances. 3. Subsidiary to the IGA, a Participation Agreement (PA) will regulate access to the services by individual Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. Among other things, the IGA provides that strict privacy, transparency and accountability controls must apply to all the services. The Department of Home Affairs will administer the services and oversee compliance with these controls. This has been put on the notice paper for this morning: Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security \u2014 Mr Hastie (Chair \u2014 Canning) to present the following report and seek leave to make a statement: Advisory report on the Identity-matching Services Bill 2019 and the Australian Passports Amendment (Identity-matching Services) Bill 2019 . The bells are ringing \u2013 the house is about to get under way. Matt Canavan will be fronting estimates this morning, where the northern Australia infrastructure fund will be under the microscope. It\u2019s unkindly called the \u201cno actual infrastructure fund\u201d by its critics in the hallways, because there hasn\u2019t been a lot of things actually built by the $5bn concessional loan fund, which was Tony Abbott\u2019s idea to turn the north into an \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d. Scott Morrison made a speech at the awards, where he heavily focused on the economic contribution of migrants. Peter Scanlon, a former Migration Council of Australia chair, spoke immediately afterwards. SBS was there and kindly let me let listen to the speech (and, if you aren\u2019t watching SBS news, you should be, because they are doing great work in this space): For at least 50 years after world war two, political leaders from both major parties spoke directly to the Australian people about the economic, social and cultural benefits of the nation\u2019s immigration program. To me however, I sense in the last 20 years, our leaders have become more reluctant to discuss the program\u2019s full impact on Australian life, dwelling mainly on its economic benefits and less on its nation building. There was spontaneous applause. Scanlon continued. This approach, I feel, has shrunk the Australian story. There was more applause and cheers. While I believe the economic benefits of migration are considerable, Australia has a much bigger story to tell, about how migration has built this nation. A story that most Australians accept and endorse. To Scott [Morrison], to Anthony [Albanese], to David [Coleman], please tell our story. Make us proud of what we have achieved. Just like my dad did for me. Last night, the Migration and Settlement awards were held in Parliament House, where attendees were served a goat cheese circle (no one tell Paul Fletcher). Peter Scanlon won the lifetime achievement award. Angus Taylor\u2019s office has sent through a statement in regards to this story from Anne Davies and Christopher Knaus: The conspiracy theory being perpetrated by the Lord Mayor is rejected. I make no apology for suggesting that the Lord Mayor should take real and meaningful action to reduce the City of Sydney\u2019s carbon emissions instead of hollow virtue-signalling through letters. One way to reduce emissions is through limiting unnecessary air travel and I suggest that the Lord Mayor\u2019s flights to Paris for the Women for Climate conference was an unnecessary indulgence. Anthony Albanese is happy to talk about the tensions within the coalition partners over the drought strategy. Here he is talking to the Nine network this morning: This is a national emergency. Quite clearly, the National Party backbench are very unhappy with their own leadership and the leadership of the coalition. We need a comprehensive plan. It\u2019s one that deals with the crisis which is there right now in terms of not just farmers, but people who rely upon farming and agriculture for their work, the workers in those areas. And, of course, the towns that are running out of water. We need to cooperate across federal, state and local government. We need to listen to farming organisations. At the moment, what you\u2019ve got is the national farmers federation that have a plan, the National Party have a plan, Scott Morrison had a leak last night to one of the TV networks about a plan coming out next week. For goodness sake. Why can\u2019t we all sit down and put the national interest first and come up with a coordinated, comprehensive, bipartisan national drought strategy. It\u2019s community affairs, economics, education and employment and foreign affairs, defence and trade in estimates land today. Andrew Hastie continued: These individual and personal stories helped us to understand and humanise the greater tragedy that is unfolding in Xinjiang province, China. I, along with many other Australians, am very troubled by the repressive surveillance state and how the Uighur people are being banned from practising their religious faith and how they are being oppressively monitored in their homes, in their communities 24/7. I am very troubled by the way that Uighurs\u2019 culture and identity is being systematically assaulted, deconstructed and scrubbed out by the authorities. I am very troubled about the clear evidence of re-education camps, where 1 million Uighurs have been forcibly detained and indoctrinated into communists\u2019 thinking. The ABC, along with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, have managed to identify 28 detention camps using satellite imagery. Most of these detained have never committed a crime. I could go on. It was a heartbreaking episode that we all needed to watch and absorb. I congratulate the ABC for running it and for the work that went into it. Last month I met with members of the Australian Uighur community in my parliamentary office. That delegation was led by Nurmuhammad Majid. It was my great honour to host them and to hear their personal stories. Every single one of them sitting in my office had family and friends interned or trapped in Xinjiang province. They have shown great courage and perseverance despite the tears, heartache and pain. I made a commitment to them that I would raise their plight in this House, tonight I fulfil that commitment. I say to them that we might not see resolution soon, but we will continue to work with you and make sure your loved ones are not forgotten. Finally, the Four Corners program identified a range of Australian businesses that were sourcing cotton from Xinjiang province, potentially using Uighur forced labour. Cotton On and Target Australia were two of them. Subsequent to the program, both businesses conducted internal reviews of their supply chains and have ceased sourcing cotton from Xinjiang province. I want to note the actions of Cotton On and Target Australia in this House and applaud them for taking the action that they have taken. Australia is a country that lives by the values of freedom and fairness, and so it is right that we acknowledge when our businesses do the right thing. I thank the House. Looks like Andrew Hastie made an interesting speech in the House late last night: Tonight I rise to speak on behalf of those who are vulnerable, persecuted and separated from their loved ones. Tonight I speak for Uighur Australians, who have family and friends facing systematic persecution and internment in Xinjiang province, in the People\u2019s Republic of China. But first I want to say a few words about the role of Australian investigative journalism and its importance for a free, democratic society. As this House is aware, the parliamentary joint committee for intelligence and security is conducting an inquiry into the freedom of the press. As the chair, it would be improper for me to make remarks about committee deliberations or what conclusions we might reach in our report, but I do want to say that we all agree that public interest and investigative journalism is vital to a thriving, liberal democracy \u2013 particularly when it comes to national security or human rights issues. A superb example of good investigative journalism is the July Four Corners program of Tell the World by ABC reporter Sophie McNeil. The program detailed the plight and suffering of more than 1 million Muslim minorities who have been rounded up, detained and and forcibly indoctrinated by the Chinese communist regime. Australian citizens or permanent residents have been targeted and jailed. Others are trapped under state surveillance, their passports seized. I was deeply moved by those who courageously showed the story on the program. I was moved by those who have been separated from their loved ones. I think of Sadam Abudusalamu, who is separated from his wife and child \u2013 a child he has never met in person. Welcome to the final sitting day for October \u2013 and the last day we\u2019ll see the House MPs here for a month. Which will hopefully give the Nationals some more time to get themselves together, as they gear up to take back the issue of drought from both the Liberals, and minor parties like One Nation \u2013 with Barnaby Joyce leading the charge. The Nationals backbench have put together its own drought plan, which Sarah Martin has laid out here: Under the plan being spearheaded by Joyce, drought-affected councils would receive $10m each, co-funded with state governments. There are 123 councils that have been deemed eligible for funding under the Coalition\u2019s existing drought communities program, suggesting the total cost for the proposal would be at least $1.2bn. The Nationals policy document says that the drought is a \u201cseminal issue\u201d for the economies of the regions and for \u201cthe politics in our representation to these regions\u201d. Joyce has been on the ABC this morning backing that in \u2013 he says it is time for the Nationals to push back. \u201cThe cabinet will come out with a drought policy, I presume next week, and if we drive our agenda which influences their outcome, that is a good outcome,\u201d Joyce told Sabra Lane. \u201cObviously, if the cabinet outcome is completely lacking, we\u2019ll continue to drive our agenda harder \u2026 We get this, and we have been playing a proper game, and we\u2019ve been playing as the dutiful Coalition partner, we\u2019ve been making sure we\u2019ve been part of the team, but there is a sense out there that we are not doing enough and that is not correct, we are driving these agendas as hard as we can.\u201d It is no coincidence that Joyce is driving this fightback. As we\u2019ve reported, there have been tensions with the Nationals leadership for sometime, since even before the election. That\u2019s dialling up again, with One Nation starting to make inroads, at least publicly, by taking ownership of traditional National party domains. We\u2019ll have that ongoing tussle, as well as this story from Anne Davies and Christopher Knaus: Angus Taylor baselessly accused Sydney\u2019s lord mayor of driving up carbon emissions by spending $15m on travel, a claim that was later backed up with a doctored council document provided to the Daily Telegraph, which reported the figure. It is unclear who altered the document. There is no suggestion that Taylor himself was responsible. If you have missed the story, you\u2019ll find it here. I am going to hunt down my third coffee (it\u2019s a fiver day, peeps, I can feel it) but I hope you\u2019re ready. Let\u2019s get into it",

      "bodyText": "Police have searched two addresses in Northern Ireland overnight in relation to the discovery of 39 bodies inside a refrigerated lorry trailer in Essex. Work is continuing to identify those who died as part of a wide-ranging murder investigation into the UK\u2019s worst such tragedy in almost 20 years. The two searches on Wednesday night are believed to be linked to the arrest of the driver, named locally as 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Portadown, who is being held and questioned on suspicion of murder by Essex police. Essex police were alerted to the discovery of the bodies of 38 adults and one teenager in a unit at an industrial park in Grays by the ambulance service at 1.40am on Wednesday. Alongside the murder inquiry, a parallel investigation has begun to examine whether organised crime networks \u2013 widely believed to be behind a recent surge in people-smuggling operations seeking to bring migrants to the UK \u2013 played a role. After the discovery, which prompted expressions of horror and demands for justice from politicians and witnesses, the 25-year-old driver was arrested on suspicion of murder. He was identified by police and community sources as Mo Robinson, from Portadown in County Armagh. It is unclear whether Robinson was aware of any plans to bring people to the UK. The lorry, which police said was from Bulgaria, was later driven away past a cordon of officers who bowed their heads and removed their hats. The vehicle had a Carrier refrigeration unit attached to it. Media reports suggested it may have been on and the migrants could have frozen to death in temperatures as low as -25C. Initially police said the lorry had entered the UK via Holyhead in north Wales. But amid a swirl of information, they later said the trailer \u2013 the rear section of the vehicle, containing the bodies \u2013 travelled from Zeebrugge into Purfleet, Essex, and arrived in the Thurrock area shortly after 12.30am. The tractor unit \u2013 the cab section at the front in which the driver sits \u2013 travelled separately from Northern Ireland. Robinson is believed to have picked up the trailer minutes before the ambulance service was alerted. On a day of fast-moving developments: Bulgaria\u2019s foreign ministry said the Scania lorry was registered in Varna, a city on the country\u2019s east coast, under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. The ministry said police had said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the victims were Bulgarians. Officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) were brought in to investigate the possible role of gangs. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was supporting the Essex police investigation, while the Irish police, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, said they would \u201cprovide every assistance possible\u201d. In an unrelated incident, nine undocumented migrants were found alive in a lorry on the M20 in Kent and were being dealt with by immigration authorities. Forensic police dressed in white coveralls were seen going in and out of the vehicle in Grays throughout the day. It remained behind a cordon until shortly before 5pm when it was escorted by a number of police vehicles to nearby Tilbury Docks. Tributes to the unidentified victims were led by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who said he was \u201cappalled by this tragic incident\u201d. It is the worst incident of its kind in the UK since the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a container in Dover, Kent, in 2000.

In the final pages of the last chapter, the authors posed the question themselves: what if we succeed? Their answer was hardly a ringing endorsement. \u201cThe trends seem not to be too terribly negative,\u201d they offered.

The result is surely the most important book on AI this year. Perhaps, as Richard Brautigan\u2019s poem has it, life is good when we are all watched over by machines of loving grace. But Russell, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, sees darker eventualities. Creating machines that surpass our intelligence would be the biggest event in human history. It may also be the last, he warns. Here he makes the convincing case that how we choose to control AI is \u201cpossibly the most important question facing humanity\u201d.</p> <p>Russell has picked his moment well. Tens of thousands of the world\u2019s brightest minds are now building AIs. Most work on one-trick ponies \u2013 the \u201cnarrow\u201d AIs that process speech, translate languages, spot people in crowds, diagnose diseases, or whip people at games from Go to Starcraft II. But these are a far cry from the field\u2019s ultimate goal: general purpose AIs that match, or surpass, the broad-based brainpower of humans.</p> <p>Its is not a ludicrous ambition. From the start, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind\" title=\"\">DeepMind, the AI group</a> owned by Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, set out to \u201csolve intelligence\u201d and then use that to solve everything else. In July, Microsoft signed a $1bn contract with OpenAI, a US outfit, to build an AI that mimics the human brain. It is a high stakes race. As Vladimir Putin said: whoever becomes the<a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/401731-ai-rule-world-putin/\" title=\"\"> leader in AI \u201cwill become the ruler</a> of the world\u201d.</p> <p>Russell doesn\u2019t claim we are nearly there. In one section he sets out the formidable problems computer engineers face in creating human-level AI. Machines must know how to turn words into coherent, reliable knowledge; they must learn how to discover new actions and order them appropriately (boil the kettle, grab a mug, toss in a teabag). And like us, they must manage their cognitive resources so they can reach good decisions fast. These are not the only hurdles, but they give a flavour of the task ahead. Russell suspects it will keep researchers busy for another 80 years, but stresses the timing is impossible to predict.</p> <p>Even with apocalypse camped on the horizon, this is a wry and witty tour of intelligence and where it may take us. And where exactly is that? A machine that masters all the above would be a \u201cformidable decision maker in the real world\u201d, Russell says. It would absorb vast amounts of information from the internet, TV, radio, satellites and CCTV and with it gain a more sophisticated understanding of the world and its inhabitants than any human could ever hope for.</p> <p>What could possibly go right? In education, AI tutors would maximise the potential of every child. They would master the vast complexity of the human body, letting us banish disease. As digital personal assistants they would put Siri and Alexa to shame: \u201cYou would, in effect, have a high-powered lawyer, accountant, and political advisor on call at any time.\u201d</p> <p>And what of the downsides? Without serious progress on AI safety and regulation, Russell foresees messes aplenty and his chapter on misuses of AI is grim reading. Advanced AI would hand governments such extraordinary powers of surveillance, persuasion and control that \u201cthe Stasi will look like amateurs\u201d. And while Terminator-style killer robots are not about to eradicate humanity, drones that select and kill individuals based on their faceprints, skin colour or uniforms are entirely feasible. As for jobs, we may no longer make a living by providing physical or mental labour, but we can still supply our humanity. Russell notes: \u201cWe will need to become good at being human.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s worse than a society-destroying AI? A society-destroying AI that won\u2019t switch off. It\u2019s a terrifying, seemingly absurd prospect that Russell devotes much time to. The idea is that smart machines will suss out, as per <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/12/how-we-made-2001-a-space-odyssey-stanley-kubrick-hal\" title=\"\">HAL in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/12/how-we-made-2001-a-space-odyssey-stanley-kubrick-hal\" title=\"\">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em>, that goals are hard to achieve if someone pulls the plug. Give a superintelligent AI a clear task \u2013 to make the coffee, say \u2013 and its first move will be to disable its off switch. The answer, Russell argues, lies in a radical new approach where AIs have some doubt about their goals, and so will never object to being shut down. He moves on to advocate \u201cprovably beneficial\u201d AI, whose algorithms are mathematically proven to benefit their human users. Suffice to say this is a work in progress. How will my AI deal with yours?</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: there are plenty of AI researchers who ridicule such fears. After the philosopher Nick Bostrom highlighted potential dangers of general purpose AI in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/superintelligence-nick-brostrom-rough-ride-future-james-lovelock-review\" title=\"\">Superintelligence</a></em> (2014), a US thinktank, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, gave its Luddism award to \u201calarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\u201d. This was indicative of the dismal debate around AI safety, which is on the brink of descending into tribalism. The danger that comes across here is less an abrupt destruction of the species, more an inexorable enfeeblement: a loss of striving and understanding, which erodes the foundations of civilisation and leaves us \u201cpassengers in a cruise ship run by machines, on a cruise that goes on forever\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Human Compatible is published by Allen Lane (\u00a325).

As Vladimir Putin said: whoever becomes the leader in AI \u201cwill become the ruler of the world\u201d. Russell doesn\u2019t claim we are nearly there. In one section he sets out the formidable problems computer engineers face in creating human-level AI. Machines must know how to turn words into coherent, reliable knowledge; they must learn how to discover new actions and order them appropriately (boil the kettle, grab a mug, toss in a teabag). And like us, they must manage their cognitive resources so they can reach good decisions fast. These are not the only hurdles, but they give a flavour of the task ahead. Russell suspects it will keep researchers busy for another 80 years, but stresses the timing is impossible to predict. Even with apocalypse camped on the horizon, this is a wry and witty tour of intelligence and where it may take us. And where exactly is that? A machine that masters all the above would be a \u201cformidable decision maker in the real world\u201d, Russell says. It would absorb vast amounts of information from the internet, TV, radio, satellites and CCTV and with it gain a more sophisticated understanding of the world and its inhabitants than any human could ever hope for. What could possibly go right? In education, AI tutors would maximise the potential of every child. They would master the vast complexity of the human body, letting us banish disease. As digital personal assistants they would put Siri and Alexa to shame: \u201cYou would, in effect, have a high-powered lawyer, accountant, and political advisor on call at any time.\u201d And what of the downsides? Without serious progress on AI safety and regulation, Russell foresees messes aplenty and his chapter on misuses of AI is grim reading. Advanced AI would hand governments such extraordinary powers of surveillance, persuasion and control that \u201cthe Stasi will look like amateurs\u201d. And while Terminator-style killer robots are not about to eradicate humanity, drones that select and kill individuals based on their faceprints, skin colour or uniforms are entirely feasible. As for jobs, we may no longer make a living by providing physical or mental labour, but we can still supply our humanity. Russell notes: \u201cWe will need to become good at being human.\u201d What\u2019s worse than a society-destroying AI? A society-destroying AI that won\u2019t switch off. It\u2019s a terrifying, seemingly absurd prospect that Russell devotes much time to. The idea is that smart machines will suss out, as per HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey, that goals are hard to achieve if someone pulls the plug. Give a superintelligent AI a clear task \u2013 to make the coffee, say \u2013 and its first move will be to disable its off switch. The answer, Russell argues, lies in a radical new approach where AIs have some doubt about their goals, and so will never object to being shut down. He moves on to advocate \u201cprovably beneficial\u201d AI, whose algorithms are mathematically proven to benefit their human users. Suffice to say this is a work in progress. How will my AI deal with yours? Let\u2019s be clear: there are plenty of AI researchers who ridicule such fears. After the philosopher Nick Bostrom highlighted potential dangers of general purpose AI in Superintelligence (2014), a US thinktank, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, gave its Luddism award to \u201calarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\u201d. This was indicative of the dismal debate around AI safety, which is on the brink of descending into tribalism. The danger that comes across here is less an abrupt destruction of the species, more an inexorable enfeeblement: a loss of striving and understanding, which erodes the foundations of civilisation and leaves us \u201cpassengers in a cruise ship run by machines, on a cruise that goes on forever\u201d. \u2022 Human Compatible is published by Allen Lane (\u00a325).

They were all helpful, put fraud-prevention Cifas markers on my credit file and cancelled the accounts. Apart from Carphone Warehouse. Since the ID fraud, I\u2019ve had repeated deliveries to my address of phones I have not ordered. I have reported this multiple times but the phones keep coming. Its fraud team investigated and concluded, in effect, it wasn\u2019t its problem. Any fraudulent contracts set up in my name are cancelled, so I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m still being sent phones. I am also checking my credit file daily and have not seen any new contracts sneak through. A note on my account warning staff not to approve orders to my address without extra checks has had no effect. At this point I\u2019m not sure if continuing fraud is being committed or if it\u2019s just a mix-up with different parts of the company. My own attempts to resolve this are going nowhere. KG, London The extraordinary aspect is that Carphone Warehouse was prepared to risk losing all the expensive handsets they bombarded you with rather than update their computer systems. For it seems it was ineptitude rather than skulduggery which caused the ongoing deliveries. It blames a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d with its warehouse team which it says it is investigating. It would be fascinating to know how many phones you might have accumulated had media intervention not stemmed the flow. Carphone Warehouse says: \u201cWe are very sorry for the inconvenience caused. We fell short here and have offered the customer \u00a3100 in goodwill and can confirm that no more phones will be sent.\u201d If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

      "body": "<p>In an autumn in which scholars have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/16/when-milton-met-shakespeare-poets-notes-on-bard-appear-to-have-been-found\">unearthed Milton\u2019s copy of Shakespeare in Philadelphia</a> and parchment fragments from the 13th-century epic <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/roman-de-la-rose\">Le Roman de la Rose</a> in Worcester, Stuart Kells, author of the forthcoming Shakespeare\u2019s Library, would like to be clear: he has not uncovered the Bard\u2019s book collection, despite what the title might suggest.</p> <p>\u201cBut I have confirmed its existence, clarified its scale and scope, and documented what happened to it,\u201d says the author, who has spent 20 years on the trail of Shakespeare\u2019s personal library, and lays out his search in his new book. \u201cIt would be a very different book if I had gone out and discovered his library. No one has done that. It isn\u2019t in one spot. To the extent that it exists, it\u2019s spread out. You need to approach Shakespeare in order to understand what it might have been like.\u201d</p> <p>Kells is by no means the first person to have embark on a quest to find Shakespeare\u2019s library during the last 400 years. As he writes, \u201cfor every species of book person, the idea of Shakespeare\u2019s library \u2013 his personal collection of manuscripts, books, letters and other papers \u2013 is enticing, totemic, a subject of wonder\u201d. Because \u201cShakespeare certainly did have books, and he certainly read them. Why, then, have we found none of his manuscripts, and why are there no books with an authentic Shakespeare signature, bookplate, book label or inscription?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Things are still being found and that\u2019s part of the fun. The people who did the initial searching were not very thorough</p> <footer> <cite>Stuart Kells</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes that, when Shakespeare died in 1616, \u201csome of the library was probably scattered\u201d. The will of the Renaissance actor Nicholas Tooley asked his executor to \u201chave a care to put off and sell my books to the most profit that he can\u201d, and Kells suspects this is what happened to Shakespeare\u2019s books. Those not sold on his death, or destroyed or lost, \u201care sitting quietly, in cabinets and on shelves, in public and private collections around the world\u201d, he speculates.</p> <p>\u201cThere are things out there still being found and that\u2019s part of the fun. The people who did the initial searching were not very thorough, so there are wonderful things still to be found,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they are around the world. People are still finding chests of early letters, and there are volumes of multiple plays all bound together. Play scripts were thought of as low literature for some time \u2013 they were slightly disreputable and weren\u2019t taken seriously. Some of 18th and 19th-century catalogues would only say, \u2018here\u2019s a bundle of play scripts.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"362abf5b33d8bc617d9da536f0b7b2012527f60d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/362abf5b33d8bc617d9da536f0b7b2012527f60d/0_0_1098_1536/715.jpg\" alt=\"The Agostino Tornielli book, from 1615.\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Agostino Tornielli book, from 1615.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Folger Shakespeare Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of his tantalising findings is the potential former owner of a theologicial work by Agostino Tornielli. The book was published in Milan in 1610 and shipped to England, where it was bound in brown calfskin in 1615, the year before Shakespeare\u2019s death. The cover panels on the book include an image of Pyramus and Thisbe, and the edges of the text block are decorated with elaborate patterning.</p> <p>\u201cThe owner of the four bindings is not known, but there are a few hints. Do the fleurons signify a literary career? That would fit the depiction of Pyramus and Thisbe, which suggests a deep interest in literature (the owner chose a literary motif over a royal, ecclesiastical, political or military one) and possibly a deep interest in Shakespearean literature,\u201d writes Kells. \u201cIn tiny letters, the cover image is signed \u2018I. S.\u2019 No one knows whether the initials are those of the block-maker, the bookbinder, the bookseller, the book\u2019s owner, a patron or a dedicatee. No one has stepped forward to claim them.\u201d</p> <p>But the initials match those of Iohannes Shakespeare, William\u2019s father, who dealt in leather hides \u2013 \u201cno doubt some of them for bookbinding\u201d, Kells writes.</p> <p>Kells believes that one of the reasons for the disappearance of Shakespeare\u2019s library is that the playwright was not an \u201cavid inscriber of books\u201d, or much of a letter writer. \u201cPractically minded and commercial, he does not seem to have been driven by abstract ideas of fame and posterity,\u201d Kells writes.</p> <p>\u201cIn thinking about Shakespeare differently, as less of a literary person and more as a workaday person, it makes you think about the library in a different way. It doesn\u2019t have lots of florid descriptions and ownership marks because he wasn\u2019t that kind of a figure,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only was he on the fringes of what was respectable, he in some ways wasn\u2019t taken seriously by literary people \u2026 To the extent he had a library, he wasn\u2019t engaging with other people through inscriptions, and he didn\u2019t take his fame very seriously. That\u2019s one reason why potentially some of the key documents aren\u2019t available.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/26/bibliomania-the-strange-history-of-compulsive-book-buying\">Bibliomania: the strange history of compulsive book buying</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for Kells, he says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop looking for the library if I wanted to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m quietly confident things are going to turn up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe now see the quarto editions as some of the greatest literary treasures in the world but, up until the 19th century, they were thought of in a different way. They are slight documents, little pamphlets, so it\u2019s very probable they\u2019re out there. We now have clearer eyes to search for these things and different ways of analysing them and dating things.

      "bodyText": "In an autumn in which scholars have unearthed Milton\u2019s copy of Shakespeare in Philadelphia and parchment fragments from the 13th-century epic Le Roman de la Rose in Worcester, Stuart Kells, author of the forthcoming Shakespeare\u2019s Library, would like to be clear: he has not uncovered the Bard\u2019s book collection, despite what the title might suggest. \u201cBut I have confirmed its existence, clarified its scale and scope, and documented what happened to it,\u201d says the author, who has spent 20 years on the trail of Shakespeare\u2019s personal library, and lays out his search in his new book. \u201cIt would be a very different book if I had gone out and discovered his library. No one has done that. It isn\u2019t in one spot. To the extent that it exists, it\u2019s spread out. You need to approach Shakespeare in order to understand what it might have been like.\u201d Kells is by no means the first person to have embark on a quest to find Shakespeare\u2019s library during the last 400 years. As he writes, \u201cfor every species of book person, the idea of Shakespeare\u2019s library \u2013 his personal collection of manuscripts, books, letters and other papers \u2013 is enticing, totemic, a subject of wonder\u201d. Because \u201cShakespeare certainly did have books, and he certainly read them. Why, then, have we found none of his manuscripts, and why are there no books with an authentic Shakespeare signature, bookplate, book label or inscription?\u201d He believes that, when Shakespeare died in 1616, \u201csome of the library was probably scattered\u201d. The will of the Renaissance actor Nicholas Tooley asked his executor to \u201chave a care to put off and sell my books to the most profit that he can\u201d, and Kells suspects this is what happened to Shakespeare\u2019s books. Those not sold on his death, or destroyed or lost, \u201care sitting quietly, in cabinets and on shelves, in public and private collections around the world\u201d, he speculates. \u201cThere are things out there still being found and that\u2019s part of the fun. The people who did the initial searching were not very thorough, so there are wonderful things still to be found,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they are around the world. People are still finding chests of early letters, and there are volumes of multiple plays all bound together. Play scripts were thought of as low literature for some time \u2013 they were slightly disreputable and weren\u2019t taken seriously. Some of 18th and 19th-century catalogues would only say, \u2018here\u2019s a bundle of play scripts.\u2019\u201d One of his tantalising findings is the potential former owner of a theologicial work by Agostino Tornielli. The book was published in Milan in 1610 and shipped to England, where it was bound in brown calfskin in 1615, the year before Shakespeare\u2019s death. The cover panels on the book include an image of Pyramus and Thisbe, and the edges of the text block are decorated with elaborate patterning. \u201cThe owner of the four bindings is not known, but there are a few hints. Do the fleurons signify a literary career? That would fit the depiction of Pyramus and Thisbe, which suggests a deep interest in literature (the owner chose a literary motif over a royal, ecclesiastical, political or military one) and possibly a deep interest in Shakespearean literature,\u201d writes Kells. \u201cIn tiny letters, the cover image is signed \u2018I. S.\u2019 No one knows whether the initials are those of the block-maker, the bookbinder, the bookseller, the book\u2019s owner, a patron or a dedicatee. No one has stepped forward to claim them.\u201d But the initials match those of Iohannes Shakespeare, William\u2019s father, who dealt in leather hides \u2013 \u201cno doubt some of them for bookbinding\u201d, Kells writes. Kells believes that one of the reasons for the disappearance of Shakespeare\u2019s library is that the playwright was not an \u201cavid inscriber of books\u201d, or much of a letter writer. \u201cPractically minded and commercial, he does not seem to have been driven by abstract ideas of fame and posterity,\u201d Kells writes. \u201cIn thinking about Shakespeare differently, as less of a literary person and more as a workaday person, it makes you think about the library in a different way. It doesn\u2019t have lots of florid descriptions and ownership marks because he wasn\u2019t that kind of a figure,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only was he on the fringes of what was respectable, he in some ways wasn\u2019t taken seriously by literary people \u2026 To the extent he had a library, he wasn\u2019t engaging with other people through inscriptions, and he didn\u2019t take his fame very seriously. That\u2019s one reason why potentially some of the key documents aren\u2019t available.\u201d As for Kells, he says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop looking for the library if I wanted to.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m quietly confident things are going to turn up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe now see the quarto editions as some of the greatest literary treasures in the world but, up until the 19th century, they were thought of in a different way. They are slight documents, little pamphlets, so it\u2019s very probable they\u2019re out there. We now have clearer eyes to search for these things and different ways of analysing them and dating things. We\u2019re in a golden era of discovery right now.\u201d \u2022 Shakespeare\u2019s Library: Unlocking the Greatest Mystery in Literature by Stuart Kells is published by Text Publishing (\u00a312.99)",

It\u2019s also an attempt to deflect attention from the role of Clinton\u2019s campaign in her own defeat. This desperate blame game is not an encouraging sign that the Democratic party will muster a winning strategy to oust the disastrous Trump administration in 2020. Equally alarming, the Clinton camp\u2019s attempts to shift responsibility for their electoral failure to \u201cRussian assets\u201d has fueled a new era of McCarthyism - a toxic brew of warmongering, political repression and censorship now poisoning our public discourse.</p> <p>By continuing to blame everyone else for their loss, the Clinton camp is suppressing serious reflection on the problems with their own campaign. These ranged from the \u201cPied Piper\u201d strategy of<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-2016-donald-trump-214428\"> urging media allies to elevate Donald Trump</a> to front-runner status, to the sabotage of Bernie Sanders by Clinton surrogates in the DNC.</p> <p>The deflection strategy also seeks to cover over a key factor in Clinton\u2019s loss: her record of serving Wall Street, promoting corporate trade deals that hurt working people, and supporting endless war and regime change disasters.</p> <p>Confronting the real reasons for Clinton\u2019s loss would open a much-needed conversation about why the Democratic establishment opposes progressive policies that are broadly popular - such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, free public higher education, and other programs to improve working people\u2019s lives. They would have to reckon with the unpopularity of their disastrous foreign policy of global military domination. These discussions would threaten not only the mega-donors funding the Democratic party machine, but also the power of the Clinton-Obama neoliberals who made their careers serving those donors.</p> <p>So instead the Clintonites blame their defeat on Russia and smear their opponents as \u201cRussian assets\u201d. This is classic McCarthyism, recalling a shameful period of paranoid hysteria and political repression.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s smear builds on a relentless attack begun the week of the 2016 Green nominating convention. At that time, Democratic operatives and media allies began obsessively promoting pictures and videos from an international media conference I had attended in Russia in 2015, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/08/dems-tactic-of-accusing-adversaries-of-kremlin-ties-and-russia-sympathies-has-long-history-in-us/\">intentionally taking them out of context to claim I was there supporting Putin</a>.

      "bodyText": "Like her attack on Tulsi Gabbard, Hillary Clinton\u2019s accusation that I am a \u201cRussian asset\u201d is a ludicrous, unhinged conspiracy theory with no basis in fact. It\u2019s also an attempt to deflect attention from the role of Clinton\u2019s campaign in her own defeat. This desperate blame game is not an encouraging sign that the Democratic party will muster a winning strategy to oust the disastrous Trump administration in 2020. Equally alarming, the Clinton camp\u2019s attempts to shift responsibility for their electoral failure to \u201cRussian assets\u201d has fueled a new era of McCarthyism - a toxic brew of warmongering, political repression and censorship now poisoning our public discourse. By continuing to blame everyone else for their loss, the Clinton camp is suppressing serious reflection on the problems with their own campaign. These ranged from the \u201cPied Piper\u201d strategy of urging media allies to elevate Donald Trump to front-runner status, to the sabotage of Bernie Sanders by Clinton surrogates in the DNC. The deflection strategy also seeks to cover over a key factor in Clinton\u2019s loss: her record of serving Wall Street, promoting corporate trade deals that hurt working people, and supporting endless war and regime change disasters. Confronting the real reasons for Clinton\u2019s loss would open a much-needed conversation about why the Democratic establishment opposes progressive policies that are broadly popular - such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, free public higher education, and other programs to improve working people\u2019s lives. They would have to reckon with the unpopularity of their disastrous foreign policy of global military domination. These discussions would threaten not only the mega-donors funding the Democratic party machine, but also the power of the Clinton-Obama neoliberals who made their careers serving those donors. So instead the Clintonites blame their defeat on Russia and smear their opponents as \u201cRussian assets\u201d. This is classic McCarthyism, recalling a shameful period of paranoid hysteria and political repression. Clinton\u2019s smear builds on a relentless attack begun the week of the 2016 Green nominating convention. At that time, Democratic operatives and media allies began obsessively promoting pictures and videos from an international media conference I had attended in Russia in 2015, intentionally taking them out of context to claim I was there supporting Putin. In reality, the Moscow trip was part of an international tour to share my message of peace and climate action with media and government officials from many nations. The campaign to associate me with Putin escalated after the election, when media outlets and pundits who ignored our press releases and social media posts from December 2015 about the Moscow trip began circulating a single picture stripped of all context, implying that I was up to something secretive and nefarious in Russia. That picture, taken at the conference gala dinner when Vladimir Putin briefly sat at my table before giving a speech, has launched a thousand conspiracy theories. Even the recount effort I initiated to investigate potential hacking or other problems in the 2016 election was accused of being a scheme funded by Russia to undermine faith in the election. All these allegations have long since been debunked, by media outlets that actually looked into the accusations instead of simply repeating them, and by a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation that failed to turn up a single lead to explore. Since then, the Green party and our campaign have been targeted by a barrage of disinformation arguing that Green voters, especially African-Americans, were duped by a Russian social media campaign. While the attempt by any nation to interfere in others\u2019 elections is reprehensible, the much-hyped Russian troll farm was a relatively minor player on the social media battlefield: minimally-funded, with juvenile posts that were mostly unrelated to the election, and lacking tools like micro-targeting or data-mining used by sophisticated operations like Cambridge Analytica.

In April this year, a research team at the University of California, San Francisco, <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/04/414296/synthetic-speech-generated-brain-recordings\">published</a> results of a successful attempt at translating neural activity into speech via a deep-learning powered BCI.</p> <p>The team placed small electronic arrays directly on the brains of five people and recorded their brain activity, as well as the movement of their jaws, mouths and tongues as they read out loud from children\u2019s books.

It may be possible to restore their communication again.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>But there are also potential applications for such technology beyond medicine. In 2017, Facebook <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/04/f8-2017-day-2/\">announced</a> that it would be investing in the development of non-invasive, wearable BCI that would allow Facebook users to \u201ctype with their brains\u201d.</p> <p>Since then, Facebook has <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/\">funded</a> research to achieve this goal, including a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4\">study</a> by the same lab at University of California, San Francisco. In this study, participants listened to multiple-choice questions and responded aloud with answers while signals were being recorded directly from their brains, which served as input data to train decoding algorithms. After this, participants listened to more questions and again responded aloud, at which point the algorithms translated the one-word answers into text on a screen in real time.</p> <p>While Facebook eagerly <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/\">reported</a> that these results indicated a step towards their goal of creating a device that will \u201clet people type just by imagining the words they want to say\u201d, according to Marc Slutzky, professor of neurology at Northwestern University, this technology is still a long way from what most people commonly understand as \u201cmind-reading\u201d.</p> <p>State-of-the-art BCIs can only decode the neural signals associated with attempted speech, or the physical act of articulation, Slutzky told me. Decoding \u201cimagined\u201d speech, which is what Facebook ultimately wants to achieve, would require translating from abstract thoughts into language, which is a far more confounding problem.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone imagines saying a sentence in their head but doesn\u2019t at least attempt to physically articulate it, it is unclear how and where in the brain the imagined sentence is conceived,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Indeed, while many philosophers of language in the 20th century<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_turn\"> proposed</a> that we think in sentence-like strings of language, use of brain imaging technology like electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) has since revealed that thinking more probably happens in a complex combination of images and associations.</p> <p>According to John Dylan Haynes, professor of neuroscience at the Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin in Berlin, it is possible to decode and read out some of these signals to some degree, but this is still far off mind-reading. \u201cThat would require a full understanding of the language of the brain,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to be very clear, we don\u2019t fully understand the language of the brain.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>But even if BCI technology can\u2019t directly read minds doesn\u2019t mean that a device couldn\u2019t be used to reveal valuable and sensitive data about an individual. The structural brain scans recorded when someone is connected to a BCI, Haynes said, can reveal with reasonable accuracy whether someone is suffering from certain diseases or whether they have some other cognitive impairment.</p> <p>While the management of this collateral data is heavily regulated in research institutes Haynes told me that no such regulations are in place for technology companies. Observing how some companies have, over the past decade, transformed troves of personal data into profit while displaying a wanton attitude to securing such data makes Haynes wary of the growing consumer BCI industry. \u201cI\u2019d be very careful about giving up our cognitive information to companies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Marcello Ienca, a research fellow at ETH Zurich who evaluates the ethics of neuro-technology, the implications of private companies gaining access to cognitive data should be carefully considered.</p> <p>\u201cWe have already reached a point where analysts at social media companies can use online data to make reliable guesses about pregnancy or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-is-using-ai-to-try-to-predict-if-youre-suicidal-2018-12\">suicidal ideation</a>,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOnce consumer BCIs become widespread and we have enough brain recordings in the digital eco-system, this incursion into parts of ourselves that we thought were unknowable is going to be even more pronounced.\u201d</p> <p>For some, however, the development of BCI technology is not only about the potential consumer applications, but more profoundly about merging humans with machines. Elon Musk, for example, has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-vbh3t7WVI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5405\">said</a> that the driving impetus in starting his own BCI company, Neuralink, which wants to weave the brain with computers using flexible wire threads, is to \u201cachieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>Adina Roskies, professor of philosophy at Dartmouth University, says that while such a \u201ccyborg future\u201d might seem compelling, it raises thorny ethical questions around identity and moral responsibility. \u201cWhen BCIs decode neural activity into some sort of action [like moving a robot arm] an algorithm is included in the cognitive process,\u201d she explained. \u201cAs these systems become more complex and abstract, it might become unclear as to who the author of some action is, whether it is a person or machine.\u201d</p> <p>As Christian Herff, professor in the department of neurosurgery at Maastricht University explained to me, some of the systems currently capable of translating neural activity into speech incorporate techniques that are similar to predictive texting. After brain signals are recorded, a predictive system, not unlike those that power Siri and Alexa, tells the algorithm which words can be decoded and in what order they should go. For example, if the algorithm decodes the phrase \u201cI is\u201d the system might change that to \u201cI am\u201d, which is a far more likely output.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case where people can\u2019t articulate their own words, these systems will help produce some sort of verbalization that they presumably want to produce,\u201d Roskies said. \u201cBut given what we know about predictive systems, you can at least imagine cases in which these things produce outputs that don\u2019t directly reflect what the person intended.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, instead of reading our thoughts, these devices might actually do some of the thinking for us.</p> <p>Roskies emphasized that we are still a fair way off such a reality, and that oftentimes, companies overhype technological ability for the sake of marketing hype. \u201cBut I do believe that the time to start thinking through some of the ethical implications of these systems is now,\u201d she said.</p>",

Foundational to this technology is the ability to decode neural signals that arise in the brain into commands that can be recognized by the machine. Because neural signals in the brain are often noisy, decoding is extremely difficult.

But advances in deep learning, an AI technique that mimics the brain\u2019s ability to learn from experience, is changing what\u2019s possible.

Since then, Facebook has funded research to achieve this goal, including a study by the same lab at University of California, San Francisco. In this study, participants listened to multiple-choice questions and responded aloud with answers while signals were being recorded directly from their brains, which served as input data to train decoding algorithms.

Decoding \u201cimagined\u201d speech, which is what Facebook ultimately wants to achieve, would require translating from abstract thoughts into language, which is a far more confounding problem. \u201cIf someone imagines saying a sentence in their head but doesn\u2019t at least attempt to physically articulate it, it is unclear how and where in the brain the imagined sentence is conceived,\u201d he said. Indeed, while many philosophers of language in the 20th century proposed that we think in sentence-like strings of language, use of brain imaging technology like electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) has since revealed that thinking more probably happens in a complex combination of images and associations. According to John Dylan Haynes, professor of neuroscience at the Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin in Berlin, it is possible to decode and read out some of these signals to some degree, but this is still far off mind-reading. \u201cThat would require a full understanding of the language of the brain,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to be very clear, we don\u2019t fully understand the language of the brain.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 But even if BCI technology can\u2019t directly read minds doesn\u2019t mean that a device couldn\u2019t be used to reveal valuable and sensitive data about an individual. The structural brain scans recorded when someone is connected to a BCI, Haynes said, can reveal with reasonable accuracy whether someone is suffering from certain diseases or whether they have some other cognitive impairment. While the management of this collateral data is heavily regulated in research institutes Haynes told me that no such regulations are in place for technology companies. Observing how some companies have, over the past decade, transformed troves of personal data into profit while displaying a wanton attitude to securing such data makes Haynes wary of the growing consumer BCI industry. \u201cI\u2019d be very careful about giving up our cognitive information to companies,\u201d he said. According to Marcello Ienca, a research fellow at ETH Zurich who evaluates the ethics of neuro-technology, the implications of private companies gaining access to cognitive data should be carefully considered. \u201cWe have already reached a point where analysts at social media companies can use online data to make reliable guesses about pregnancy or suicidal ideation,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce consumer BCIs become widespread and we have enough brain recordings in the digital eco-system, this incursion into parts of ourselves that we thought were unknowable is going to be even more pronounced.\u201d For some, however, the development of BCI technology is not only about the potential consumer applications, but more profoundly about merging humans with machines. Elon Musk, for example, has said that the driving impetus in starting his own BCI company, Neuralink, which wants to weave the brain with computers using flexible wire threads, is to \u201cachieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence\u201d. Adina Roskies, professor of philosophy at Dartmouth University, says that while such a \u201ccyborg future\u201d might seem compelling, it raises thorny ethical questions around identity and moral responsibility. \u201cWhen BCIs decode neural activity into some sort of action [like moving a robot arm] an algorithm is included in the cognitive process,\u201d she explained. \u201cAs these systems become more complex and abstract, it might become unclear as to who the author of some action is, whether it is a person or machine.\u201d As Christian Herff, professor in the department of neurosurgery at Maastricht University explained to me, some of the systems currently capable of translating neural activity into speech incorporate techniques that are similar to predictive texting. After brain signals are recorded, a predictive system, not unlike those that power Siri and Alexa, tells the algorithm which words can be decoded and in what order they should go. For example, if the algorithm decodes the phrase \u201cI is\u201d the system might change that to \u201cI am\u201d, which is a far more likely output. \u201cIn the case where people can\u2019t articulate their own words, these systems will help produce some sort of verbalization that they presumably want to produce,\u201d Roskies said. \u201cBut given what we know about predictive systems, you can at least imagine cases in which these things produce outputs that don\u2019t directly reflect what the person intended.\u201d In other words, instead of reading our thoughts, these devices might actually do some of the thinking for us. Roskies emphasized that we are still a fair way off such a reality, and that oftentimes, companies overhype technological ability for the sake of marketing hype. \u201cBut I do believe that the time to start thinking through some of the ethical implications of these systems is now,\u201d she said.",

With his lower profile, his campaign has been told by some of the main networks that they won\u2019t book him for interviews \u2013 even on foreign policy, despite his experience. He raised almost $375,000 in the third quarter of 2019, a total that pales in comparison with the $25m Warren raked in, or even the $2.3m raised by Steve Bullock, the Montana governor running at a more Sestak-esque 0.2% in national polls, but not a bad start. That fundraising total, combined with his polling, means he is highly unlikely to meet the threshold for the next televised Democratic debate in November. But, marching uphill in New Hampshire, Sestak told the Guardian he had no plans to drop out. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go through this if I didn\u2019t think we have a possibility of winning,\u201d he said. He had an additional 16 miles (26km) to go that day \u2013 a long way, but nothing compared with the distance he has to make up if he is to be the Democrat\u2019s choice in the race for the White House.",

Nine teams over the course of three days hurl 500,000 pounds of oranges (from Sicily; they aren\u2019t grown in these parts) in their attempt to kill the tyrannical marquis, who apparently was decapitated by the local miller\u2019s daughter; the story dates from the middle ages. As a spectator you won\u2019t be involved in the crossfire, but there is an incredible amount of oranges to contend with on the ground. It\u2019s one of the largest food fights in Italy, and culminates with the funeral of the marquis. There is a huge variety of street food available at reasonable prices. It\u2019s a fun, feel-good festival that will leave you smelling of citrus for days.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Driver arrested on suspicion of murder</h2> \n<p>Hello and welcome to the Guardian morning briefing with me, Warren Murray.</p> \n<p>Overnight, police have searched two properties in Co Armagh in relation to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/police-work-identify-39-people-found-dead-inside-lorry-essex\">discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Grays, Essex</a>. The searches are believed to be linked to the arrest of the driver, named in reports as 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Portadown, who is being held and questioned on suspicion of murder by Essex police.</p> \n<p>This morning, authorities will continue their work to identify the 38 adults and one teenager found dead on Wednesday. Police are examining whether organised crime networks linked to a recent surge in people-smuggling into the UK are responsible. The lorry trailer came from Bulgaria, authorities said. Robinson is believed to have arrived in the UK via Holyhead, one of Britain\u2019s busiest ferry ports, and picked up the trailer in Essex shortly before emergency services were called.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5492f656-2b4b-4556-b4fa-8a830a2f65cc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FedJMrz95Kw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was \u201cappalled by this tragic incident\u201d \u2013 the worst of its kind in Britain since the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a container in Dover, Kent in 2000. The case throws a spotlight on the perilous journey of asylum seekers into Europe via the Balkans. Often they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/essex-lorry-deaths-how-dangerous-is-the-journey-to-the-uk\">end up on lorries and trucks managed by smugglers</a>. Before yesterday\u2019s discovery in Essex, 58 migrant deaths on land in Europe had been recorded for 2019 \u2013 22 of which were from \u201cvehicle-related\u201d incidents. A further 24 people have died <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/essex-lorry-deaths-how-dangerous-is-the-journey-to-the-uk\">on the western Balkans route</a>. Five have drowned in the Channel, and a stowaway on a plane fell to his death over London on 30 June. More than 1,000 migrants and refugees have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year, according to the UN.</p> \n<p>Hauliers approached by the Guardian in Holyhead said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/people-smuggling-checks-at-uk-ports-inadequate-hauliers-say\">checks on people smuggling at UK ports were often inadequate</a> and that such an incident had been \u201ca matter of time\u201d. Drivers told of regular hazards they faced with refugees and migrants trying to climb into their vehicles. Hugh Williams, who runs the Edinburgh Castle pub opposite the Holyhead ferry port, said: \u201cDesperate people trying to escape desperate circumstances and someone has made money out of this misery. It is disgusting.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Republicans in bizarre stunt \u2013 </strong>Republicans have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/chaos-erupts-as-republicans-barge-into-trump-impeachment-inquiry-hearing\">\u201cstormed\u201d a closed-door hearing of the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry</a> to interrupt what they called \u201csecret\u201d proceedings. But the committees carrying out the investigation already include both Republicans and Democrats. The intervention came after Donald Trump called on Republicans to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d on his behalf \u2013 apparently rattled by devastating testimony from the ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, about efforts on Trump\u2019s behalf to make US aid conditional on Kyiv\u2019s assistance in smearing Joe Biden. \u201cRepublicans are playing to an audience of one, and the president\u2019s proud of them, but we\u2019re going to continue to do all the work,\u201d said the Democratic congressman David Cicilline, a member of the House foreign affairs committee.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Having a WAB-ble \u2013 </strong>MPs on both the Labour and Conservative sides of the Commons are voicing their doubts about the idea of a general election amid the impasse over the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill (WAB). Some in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading suggests his deal has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/johnsons-cabinet-split-over-gambling-on-pre-christmas-election\">enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament</a>. Meanwhile there is anxiety among Labour MPs about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/jeremy-corbyn-urged-by-mps-to-resist-calls-for-election\">abandoning the idea of a Brexit referendum in favour of a pre-Christmas election</a>, especially with the party well behind the Conservatives in recent published polls. Owen Jones says Labour should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/labour-election-brexit-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\">bite the bullet and agree to an election</a>. The prime minister has told MPs he is awaiting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/brexit-european-leaders-back-call-for-delay-end-january-extension\">decision of the EU27</a> over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. That decision is unlikely to come from Brussels before Friday.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Oil lobby\u2019s reach into EU politics \u2013 </strong>The five biggest oil and gas companies \u2013 BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total \u2013 and their industry groups have spent at least \u20ac251m (\u00a3217m) lobbying the EU over climate policies since 2010. Researchers say the figure represents the tip of the iceberg, as in some years companies made no declarations of spending in the voluntary EU transparency register. Pascoe Sabido, researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, said the oil and gas lobby had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/24/fossil-fuel-big-five-spent-251m-lobbying-european-union-2010-climate-crisis\">delayed, weakened and sabotaged EU action on the climate emergency</a> thanks to their hefty lobby spending. A cool quarter of a billion over the last decade buys a lot of access and influence in Brussels.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Facebook founder grilled \u2013 </strong>Mark Zuckerberg has been questioned by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook\u2019s reluctance to ban lies in political advertising. The Democratic congresswoman\u2019s questions about whether Facebook would take down campaign ads that told lies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-facebook-cambridge-analytica\">drew extensive fudging from Zuckerberg</a> who at times struggled to answer. Zuckerberg was appearing at a committee hearing regarding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-congress-testimony-libra-facebook\">launch of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project, Libra</a>. \u201cIn order for us to make decisions about Libra, I think we need to kind of dig into your past behaviour and Facebook\u2019s past behaviour with respect to our democracy,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez. Poppy Noor writes: \u201cAOC has shown a remarkable ability to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/alexandria-\">extract energising viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings</a>. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Wanted known \u2013 </strong>Coldplay has revealed the tracks of its new album, Everyday Life, by placing ads in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/24/coldplay-use-classified-ads-in-local-papers-to-reveal-new-album-tracks\">classified sections of newspapers around the world</a>. The band started close to home with local papers in north Wales and Devon but also included Australia\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald, the Otago Daily Times in New Zealand and Le Monde in France. In the North Wales Daily Post, the advertisement sits alongside ads for bales of hay and a fridge-freezer. Lead guitarist Jonny Buckland tweeted: \u201cI once had a holiday job at the Daily Post, placing photos of houses for sale. I wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Klein on the climate crisis</h2> \n<p>Activist and author Naomi Klein tells Anushka Asthana that combating the climate crisis must be at the heart of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/oct/24/naomi-klein-on-how-politics-can-solve-the-climate-crisis-podcast\">urgent restructuring of politics and the economy</a>.

The pound is trading around $1.291 and \u20ac1.159 at time of writing. Currency markets are sticking to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the eurozone, Japan and United States due to review policy. Asian shares have pulled ahead as corporate earnings and a ceasefire in northern Syria helped prop up sentiment. On Wall Street overnight the Dow and the Nasdaq added 0.2% each while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3%.

Overnight, police have searched two properties in Co Armagh in relation to the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Grays, Essex. The searches are believed to be linked to the arrest of the driver, named in reports as 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Portadown, who is being held and questioned on suspicion of murder by Essex police. This morning, authorities will continue their work to identify the 38 adults and one teenager found dead on Wednesday. Police are examining whether organised crime networks linked to a recent surge in people-smuggling into the UK are responsible. The lorry trailer came from Bulgaria, authorities said. Robinson is believed to have arrived in the UK via Holyhead, one of Britain\u2019s busiest ferry ports, and picked up the trailer in Essex shortly before emergency services were called. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was \u201cappalled by this tragic incident\u201d \u2013 the worst of its kind in Britain since the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a container in Dover, Kent in 2000. The case throws a spotlight on the perilous journey of asylum seekers into Europe via the Balkans. Often they end up on lorries and trucks managed by smugglers. Before yesterday\u2019s discovery in Essex, 58 migrant deaths on land in Europe had been recorded for 2019 \u2013 22 of which were from \u201cvehicle-related\u201d incidents. A further 24 people have died on the western Balkans route. Five have drowned in the Channel, and a stowaway on a plane fell to his death over London on 30 June. More than 1,000 migrants and refugees have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year, according to the UN. Hauliers approached by the Guardian in Holyhead said checks on people smuggling at UK ports were often inadequate and that such an incident had been \u201ca matter of time\u201d. Drivers told of regular hazards they faced with refugees and migrants trying to climb into their vehicles. Hugh Williams, who runs the Edinburgh Castle pub opposite the Holyhead ferry port, said: \u201cDesperate people trying to escape desperate circumstances and someone has made money out of this misery. It is disgusting.\u201d * * * Republicans in bizarre stunt \u2013 Republicans have \u201cstormed\u201d a closed-door hearing of the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry to interrupt what they called \u201csecret\u201d proceedings. But the committees carrying out the investigation already include both Republicans and Democrats. The intervention came after Donald Trump called on Republicans to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d on his behalf \u2013 apparently rattled by devastating testimony from the ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, about efforts on Trump\u2019s behalf to make US aid conditional on Kyiv\u2019s assistance in smearing Joe Biden. \u201cRepublicans are playing to an audience of one, and the president\u2019s proud of them, but we\u2019re going to continue to do all the work,\u201d said the Democratic congressman David Cicilline, a member of the House foreign affairs committee. * * * Having a WAB-ble \u2013 MPs on both the Labour and Conservative sides of the Commons are voicing their doubts about the idea of a general election amid the impasse over the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill (WAB). Some in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading suggests his deal has enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament. Meanwhile there is anxiety among Labour MPs about abandoning the idea of a Brexit referendum in favour of a pre-Christmas election, especially with the party well behind the Conservatives in recent published polls. Owen Jones says Labour should bite the bullet and agree to an election. The prime minister has told MPs he is awaiting the decision of the EU27 over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. That decision is unlikely to come from Brussels before Friday. * * * Oil lobby\u2019s reach into EU politics \u2013 The five biggest oil and gas companies \u2013 BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total \u2013 and their industry groups have spent at least \u20ac251m (\u00a3217m) lobbying the EU over climate policies since 2010. Researchers say the figure represents the tip of the iceberg, as in some years companies made no declarations of spending in the voluntary EU transparency register. Pascoe Sabido, researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, said the oil and gas lobby had \u201cdelayed, weakened and sabotaged EU action on the climate emergency thanks to their hefty lobby spending. A cool quarter of a billion over the last decade buys a lot of access and influence in Brussels.\u201d * * * Facebook founder grilled \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg has been questioned by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook\u2019s reluctance to ban lies in political advertising. The Democratic congresswoman\u2019s questions about whether Facebook would take down campaign ads that told lies drew extensive fudging from Zuckerberg who at times struggled to answer. Zuckerberg was appearing at a committee hearing regarding the launch of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project, Libra. \u201cIn order for us to make decisions about Libra, I think we need to kind of dig into your past behaviour and Facebook\u2019s past behaviour with respect to our democracy,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez. Poppy Noor writes: \u201cAOC has shown a remarkable ability to extract energising viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle. * * * Wanted known \u2013 Coldplay has revealed the tracks of its new album, Everyday Life, by placing ads in the classified sections of newspapers around the world. The band started close to home with local papers in north Wales and Devon but also included Australia\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald, the Otago Daily Times in New Zealand and Le Monde in France. In the North Wales Daily Post, the advertisement sits alongside ads for bales of hay and a fridge-freezer. Lead guitarist Jonny Buckland tweeted: \u201cI once had a holiday job at the Daily Post, placing photos of houses for sale. I wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Klein on the climate crisis Activist and author Naomi Klein tells Anushka Asthana that combating the climate crisis must be at the heart of an urgent restructuring of politics and the economy. Plus: Daniel Trilling on the shocking discovery of 39 bodies inside a lorry in Essex. Lunchtime read: The culinary gourds are smiling on us Yesterday we brought you some frightening statistics on pumpkin wastage at Halloween, with more than 8m of them expected to be binned uneaten this year. Tony Naylor writes: \u201cIt can be hard work to hollow out these thin-walled but robust monsters, discard the toughest fibrous bits, separate the seeds and create something tasty from the watery flesh. But you can make delicious food from even the most unpromising pumpkin.\u201d Naylor rounds up some enticing ideas from chefs, bakers and cookery writers. Sport George Ford is expected to face New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final, with Eddie Jones springing another selection surprise in a team that is probably \u201cthe tightest group of England players there has ever been\u201d, according to Manu Tuilagi. Wales, meanwhile, are confident the centres Jonathan Davies and Hadleigh Parkes will be fit for their semi-final against South Africa. J\u00fcrgen Klopp praised Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for two \u201csensational\u201d goals in a 4-1 win over Genk but admitted he was less than impressed with Liverpool\u2019s overall performance in Belgium. Frank Lampard said Chelsea had provided the blueprint for future success with their display in the 1-0 Champions League win at Ajax, which fired their hopes of qualification for the last 16. The England and Wales Cricket Board has insisted the Hundred will be judged a success only if it \u201cgrows the game as a whole\u201d after the controversial new cricket format came under sustained scrutiny from MPs. And five years after finally admitting female members, the R&amp;A has made the decision to allow golfers to get ready on the premises at the Old Course by installing a women\u2019s changing room. Business After soaring 6% in two weeks of volatile trade, sterling has stabilised as Brexit appears to be in a holding pattern. The pound is trading around $1.291 and \u20ac1.159 at time of writing. Currency markets are sticking to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the eurozone, Japan and United States due to review policy. Asian shares have pulled ahead as corporate earnings and a ceasefire in northern Syria helped prop up sentiment. On Wall Street overnight the Dow and the Nasdaq added 0.2% each while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3%. Tesla shares jumped 21% in after-hours trading following a surprise third-quarter profit. The FTSE is trending flat to a few points down ahead of the open. The papers The discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex is the main story on most of the front pages today, including the Guardian: \u201cPolice work to identify 39 people found dead in lorry\u201d, the Daily Telegraph: \u201cHuman cargo driven to frozen fate\u201d, the Mirror: \u201cThe tomb of steel\u201d and the i: \u201cDream of a new life ends in horror\u201d. Several papers feature pictures of Mo Robinson, whom police are questioning in connection with the deaths, including the Sun: \u201c39 dead in his truck\u201d, the Times: \u201cLorry migrants froze to death\u201d and the Mail, which asks \u201cWhy were warnings ignored?\u201d saying ministers were warned about the port three years ago. The Express features the truck on its front page, but leads on \u201cFury over EU still deciding our fate\u201d while the FT has \u201cSoftBank to force 4,000 WeWork job cuts as part of turnaround plan\u201d.

The wind, the stars and the tides guided them. The ocean was inundating the island \u2013 garden crops and fresh water supplies were being destroyed by brackish water. The Samu clan on my athe\u2019s (grandfather\u2019s) side, were one of the clans that had decided to relocate. The Ait Koedal clan of my aka\u2019s (grandmother\u2019s) side would choose to stay. I sometimes think of my aka, holding her baby (my ama) just a few months old, slipping into the water and climbing aboard the boat, waving goodbye to her family, and seeing her island home slip below the line of the horizon. The clans would establish communities on the mainland called Bamaga and then Seisia. The area where my ama grew up was called \u201cSweet Corner\u201d. The kids who owned it were the Sweet Corner girls and the Sweet Corner boys.</p> <p>My father was born in England just after the second world war. I remember my his mother telling me about being in London during the war. She spoke of bombs that would whistle through the sky and then go deathly silent, of not knowing if they would drop miles away or right on top of you. I sometimes think of my grandmother listening to the whistle and then the silence, holding her baby close.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each time something difficult has happened to me, something beautiful has come out of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These two stories of fierce matriarchs stay with me.</p> <p>Years later my parents would meet in Bamaga and marry in a half-built church, with all of my ama\u2019s family, none of my dad\u2019s, and a few pet dogs. A few years and siblings later, along came me.</p> <p>As a kid growing up in Roma, western Queensland, in the 80s I would flick through the pages of my dad\u2019s National Geographics, mostly looking at the photos, imagining I was in some faraway world. I didn\u2019t know it at the time but, in many ways, I was looking at my future. Although writing and directing were not the things I did when I left school, they found their way into my life through the people I met, the stories they told and how they made me feel.</p> <p>Ten years ago my beautiful ama passed away. It was before my daughter was born. I made my first short dramatic film called <a href=\"https://iview.abc.net.au/show/water\">Water</a>, a sci-fi story set in the near future of a strong woman who, while heavily pregnant, crosses a dry salt lake. I dedicated the film to my daughter as a reminder to her of the strong and fierce women who have walked before her on both sides.</p> <p>The second short film that I wrote and directed is <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/1595778115740/out-of-range\">Out of Range</a>. It\u2019s a story of reconnection \u2013 I was tired of seeing how Indigenous dads were portrayed in the media. None of these portrayals reflected me, my brothers, my uncles and grandfathers.

      "bodyText": "If we look at our lives as a collection of stories, how do they affect who we are today and who we\u2019d like to be tomorrow? Our memories are shaped by how we felt in those moments, not by the actions within them. It\u2019s these feelings that sit in our beings, that shape our energy and perspectives as we move through the world. As storytellers we try to explore these truths. In 1947, when my ama (mother) was just a few months old, a number of clans from Saibai Island made the brave decision to cross the treacherous waters to mainland Australia, sailing on pearling luggers. The wind, the stars and the tides guided them. The ocean was inundating the island \u2013 garden crops and fresh water supplies were being destroyed by brackish water. The Samu clan on my athe\u2019s (grandfather\u2019s) side, were one of the clans that had decided to relocate. The Ait Koedal clan of my aka\u2019s (grandmother\u2019s) side would choose to stay. I sometimes think of my aka, holding her baby (my ama) just a few months old, slipping into the water and climbing aboard the boat, waving goodbye to her family, and seeing her island home slip below the line of the horizon. The clans would establish communities on the mainland called Bamaga and then Seisia. The area where my ama grew up was called \u201cSweet Corner\u201d. The kids who owned it were the Sweet Corner girls and the Sweet Corner boys. My father was born in England just after the second world war. I remember my his mother telling me about being in London during the war. She spoke of bombs that would whistle through the sky and then go deathly silent, of not knowing if they would drop miles away or right on top of you. I sometimes think of my grandmother listening to the whistle and then the silence, holding her baby close. These two stories of fierce matriarchs stay with me. Years later my parents would meet in Bamaga and marry in a half-built church, with all of my ama\u2019s family, none of my dad\u2019s, and a few pet dogs. A few years and siblings later, along came me. As a kid growing up in Roma, western Queensland, in the 80s I would flick through the pages of my dad\u2019s National Geographics, mostly looking at the photos, imagining I was in some faraway world. I didn\u2019t know it at the time but, in many ways, I was looking at my future. Although writing and directing were not the things I did when I left school, they found their way into my life through the people I met, the stories they told and how they made me feel. Ten years ago my beautiful ama passed away. It was before my daughter was born. I made my first short dramatic film called Water, a sci-fi story set in the near future of a strong woman who, while heavily pregnant, crosses a dry salt lake. I dedicated the film to my daughter as a reminder to her of the strong and fierce women who have walked before her on both sides. The second short film that I wrote and directed is Out of Range. It\u2019s a story of reconnection \u2013 I was tired of seeing how Indigenous dads were portrayed in the media. None of these portrayals reflected me, my brothers, my uncles and grandfathers. I\u2019d dedicate this film to my good bala, Martin Leroy Adams, who passed away after I had made my first film. It occurs to me that each time something difficult has happened to me, something beautiful has come out of it. If our lives are a collection of stories, what would they be without suffering? And what is this potential in us to turn this suffering into an inspired place of beauty, that uplifts and takes us to the best versions of ourselves? Directing one of my latest works, Kutcha\u2019s Carpool Koorioke, has been a reminder of the beauty that can grow from difficult times. There\u2019s an episode where Kutcha Edwards is joined by Archie Roach and Uncle Jack Charles.

That\u2019s more than 18,000 tonnes of edible flesh. Most of us do not even consider pumpkins food.</p> <p>That misunderstanding has been compounded by carving pumpkins occasionally being labelled \u201cfor ornamental use only\u201d. But that is changing: Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose, for example, do not use such labelling; all of their carving pumpkins are edible.</p> <p>It can be hard work to hollow out these thin-walled but robust monsters, discard the toughest fibrous bits, separate the seeds and create something tasty from the watery flesh. But you can make delicious food from even the most unpromising pumpkin. Here are some ideas from chefs, bakers and cookery writers.</p> <h2><strong>Pumpkin and sage picnic pie</strong></h2> <p>The wet flesh in bigger pumpkins lends itself to pie fillings. Roast chunks with lots of garlic until caramelised and toss it in a blitzed dressing of sage, lemon zest and oil. Line a bread tin with shortcrust pastry (at home, I use all-butter Jus-Rol) and pack the mix in. After cooking \u2013 45 minutes at 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas mark 7 \u2013 the filling will still be juicy and the pastry perfect \u2013 and you get that mosaic effect of the dressing and its flavours running around the chunks and right through the pie. <br><em>Calum Franklin, executive chef, Holborn Dining Rooms, London</em></p> <h2><strong>Pumpkin tortelli</strong></h2> <p>Halloween pumpkins can be watery, so once you\u2019ve cooked the flesh, hang it in a colander overnight to get rid of as much liquid as possible. You want intense flavour. These tortelli come from Lombardy and they are basically pumpkin mixed with mostarda (mustard oil and fruit preserve) and parmesan, stuffed into pasta and served with sage butter. It isn\u2019t measured exactly; it\u2019s down to taste. Puree the mixture if you like, too. I would recommend people make fresh pasta for this. Roll it out thinly in one long strip, dot your pumpkin mix on, fold it over, seal it, cut it \u2013 I use a square shape \u2013 and you have lovely tortelli. <br><em>Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, London</em></p> <h2><strong>Pumpkin sourdough</strong></h2> <p>When you add roasted, liquidised pumpkin to sourdough (200g to 1kg of flour; reduce the water slightly), you get a gorgeous loaf. It imparts a natural earthy flavour, as well as making the crumb noticeably softer. And you get a crisper crust. After removing any fibrous material around the seeds, gently dry them in a low oven and roast them with salt and olive oil \u2013 you can put them in the bread, too. The key thing to know when adding seeds is that they suck moisture from bread. Immediately after roasting them, pour a little water over the seeds and they will absorb it. You will get all the toasted flavour, but no dry seeds. <br><em>Aidan Monks, owner-baker, Lovingly Artisan, Cumbria</em></p> <h2><strong>Pumpkin jam</strong></h2> <p>Technically, because it contains seeds, pumpkin is a fruit \u2013 so why not treat it as one? Finely chop the flesh, add a little water and a handful of brown sugar and let it bubble until pulpy. Blitz with a hand blender, put it back on the stove and cook it until it is thick and spitting. Let it cool and thicken and there you go: pumpkin jam. It\u2019s sweet, so stick it on dark rye sourdough. It needs that bitterness. <br><em>Andrew Dargue, chef-owner, Vanilla Black, London</em></p> <h2><strong>Broad bean and pumpkin stew</strong></h2> <p>Locro de zapallo is a classic Peruvian, originally Andean, dish, usually served with white rice. The quick, easy version is: saut\u00e9 sliced onions, garlic and red chilli in olive oil, add pumpkin (250g per person, roughly cubed) and vegetable stock, and cook until the pumpkin breaks down but still retains some chunks. To finish, add cooked broad beans, tons of chopped parsley and a dash of cumin. It should be a vibrantly orange, garlicky, thick, sloppy stew, fresh with parsley. This is vegan but, if you want, add cream and crumbled feta. <br><em>Martin Morales, chef-owner, Ceviche restaurants, London</em></p> <h2><strong>Arnad\u00ed de calabaza</strong></h2> <p>Ideally, choose a smaller, sweeter pumpkin for this tasty, simple Valencian dessert. Cover the pumpkin with foil and bake for about an hour at 190C (170C fan)/gas mark 5. In a sieve, press out as much water as possible and then mash it until smooth. To make four portions, mix 400g of pumpkin with 50g ground almonds, 60g sugar, one egg yolk, half a teaspoon of cinnamon and lemon zest. Spoon it into individual ramekins, top with blanched almonds and honey and bake until golden. We serve it with homemade turr\u00f3n ice cream. <br><em>Joe Wright, chef-owner, Porta, Chester</em></p> <h2><strong>Sweetcorn and pumpkin chowder</strong></h2> <p>A light, vegan hug-in-a-bowl for autumn. Saut\u00e9 onion, minced garlic and charred sweetcorn with four tablespoons of olive oil. Add a tablespoon of plain or gluten-free flour, followed by cubes of pumpkin \u2013 you can use any, from fibrous Halloween types to our favourite acorn squash. Then, adding veg stock slowly, cook until it is just soft. Finish with seasoning, chopped flat-leaf parsley and roasted pumpkin seeds. <br><em>Samantha Evans, chef-owner, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry, Wales</em></p> <h2><strong>Chana chaat</strong></h2> <p>Dry-fried pumpkin seeds \u2013 keep them moving in the pan so they don\u2019t burn \u2013 are great in adventurous salads. They work especially well as a nutty complement to sweet-sour pops of fresh fruit. One of my favourites is our take on chana chaat. This sees toasted pumpkin seeds, couscous, chickpeas, raisins, a little fresh tomato and pomegranate seeds tossed together, seasoned and drizzled with coriander-mint dressing, made by blitzing fresh coriander, toasted coriander seeds, mint, sugar, pickled chillies, sunflower seeds, turmeric and lime juice. <br><em>Nav</em><em>ed Nasir, executive chef, Dishoom</em></p> <h2><strong>Red pipian sauce</strong></h2> <p>This pre-Hispanic Mexican recipe uses pumpkin seeds, with the red coming from charred tomatoes and dried guajillo chilli. Roast 800g of tomatoes, 500g of onions and peeled garlic, turning occasionally. Toast 25g of chillies for about 30 seconds, then soften them in boiling water. In a blender, process all the ingredients and 380g of toasted pumpkin seeds until smooth. Pass the salsa through a strainer, season and serve with the roasted chicken or pumpkin. It\u2019s a kiss of spiciness \u2013 but not overpowering. <br><em>Martha Ortiz, chef-patron, Ella Canta, London</em></p> <h2><strong>Spiced pumpkin panna cotta</strong></h2> <p>This is my take on a pumpkin spiced latte. To make six, put half a tablespoon of coffee granules in 300ml of milk \u2013 granules work best to get that proper coffee taste \u2013 and heat until infused. Then add 360ml of cooked pumpkin puree, 420ml of double cream, 120ml of caster sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix it together and bring it almost to the boil. Off the heat, add three sheets of pre-soaked bronze leaf gelatine. Whisk thoroughly and sieve it. Pour into moulds and allow six hours to set. <br><em>Roberta Hall, chef-owner, The Little Chartroom, Edinburgh</em></p> <h2><br><strong>Pumpkin and lentil wellington</strong></h2> <p>A warm, hearty core to a vegan roast. Seeds and excess innards extracted, dice a pumpkin\u2019s edible core into 2cm cubes and bake at 210C (190 fan)/410F/gas mark 7 with oil and garlic for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, simmer the lentils in water with diced onion, bay leaves and thyme. Using Jus-Rol puff pastry, roll out a long rectangle. Leaving space at one edge to roll it over, add the pumpkin, drained lentils and onions mixture lengthways, minus the bay leaves and thyme. Brush the seal with soya milk, roll it over, brush the exterior, sprinkle with salt and bake on greaseproof paper until golden, about 30 minutes. Slice, serve. <br><em>Nathan Wattam, head chef, Common, Manchester</em></p> <h2><strong>Fermented pumpkin</strong></h2> <p>Remove the rubber seal from a Kilner jar (some air needs to escape) and add your pumpkin flesh, leaving a one-third space at the top because it will expand. Add small amounts of sympathetic spices \u2013 nutmeg, cinnamon, smoky black cardamom \u2013 plus enough water to completely cover the pumpkin, and 2% salt (eg 20g salt to 1kg pumpkin). Leave that in a warm kitchen for four days; the <em>lactobacillus</em> fermentation will start and it will turn sour and pickle-like. Refrigerated, it lasts for ages. We use it pureed with game or as a base for savoury tarts. <br><em>Matthew Pennington, chef-owner, the Ethicurean, near Bristol</em></p>",

Nathan Wattam, head chef, Common, Manchester Fermented pumpkin Remove the rubber seal from a Kilner jar (some air needs to escape) and add your pumpkin flesh, leaving a one-third space at the top because it will expand. Add small amounts of sympathetic spices \u2013 nutmeg, cinnamon, smoky black cardamom \u2013 plus enough water to completely cover the pumpkin, and 2% salt (eg 20g salt to 1kg pumpkin). Leave that in a warm kitchen for four days; the lactobacillus fermentation will start and it will turn sour and pickle-like. Refrigerated, it lasts for ages. We use it pureed with game or as a base for savoury tarts. Matthew Pennington, chef-owner, the Ethicurean, near Bristol",

      "bodyText": "As he prepares to descend an abandoned mineshaft in the Johannesburg suburb of Roodepoort, Fix, a sinewy informal goldminer from Lesotho, recounts stories of subterranean gun battles and unearthing the scattered bones of those who came before him. \u201cThis is very dangerous work,\u201d he says, draining a quart of beer for courage. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of money down there.\u201d South Africa\u2019s commercial capital of approximately 5 million inhabitants sits atop some of the world\u2019s largest gold deposits, as evinced by the more than 200 towering spoil heaps that punctuate its sprawling cityscape. Millions of ounces of unmined gold are still believed to lie beneath its surface, fuelling a booming but frequently deadly illicit goldmining industry. Fix, recruited and brought to South Africa by a criminal syndicate in 2013, has spent six years traversing Johannesburg\u2019s estimated 140km (87-mile) labyrinth of underground mine tunnels. Sometimes, he says, he can go down a shaft in the far west of the city and emerge bleary eyed on its opposite edge a week later. In some mining areas surrounding Johannesburg, informal miners have been rumoured to spend as long as six months underground, sustained by makeshift underground villages where basic foodstuffs, airtime, alcohol and even sex are sold at dramatically inflated prices. Media reports suggest that more than 300 informal miners \u2013 most of them illegal, and known locally as zama zamas, meaning \u201ctake a chance\u201d in isiZulu \u2013 have been killed by collapsing mineshafts or, more frequently, in turf wars between rival syndicates. Many more are likely still unaccounted for underground. A man walks in front of a goldmine dump outside Soweto According to a 2015 report by the South African Human Rights Commission, there are as many as 30,000 zama zamas operating across South Africa, most of them concentrated in and around Johannesburg. Like Fix, about 75% are said to be undocumented migrants, primarily from Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The rise of the burgeoning illicit gold trade, which is estimated to cost South African coffers more than \u00a3753m a year, is largely a product of the formal mining industry\u2019s collapse. Gold was first discovered on the Witwatersrand reef in 1886, leading to the establishment and rapid industrialisation of Johannesburg and accounting for its longstanding status as the world\u2019s largest city not found beside a major water source. By the 1970s, South Africa was by far the biggest global gold producer, with more than 75% of all reserves, which contributed more than 21% of the country\u2019s GDP. But a steep decline in gold prices and deposits as well as rising labour and electricity costs during the past decade led to widespread mine closures and almost halved the sector\u2019s workforce by 2016. \u201cThe significant level at which mines are still shutting down and retrenching has a direct impact on the number of people going to the informal mining industry,\u201d says Kgothatso Nhlengethwa, a Johannesburg-based geologist and researcher on informal mining. Today, there are an estimated 6,000 abandoned or disused mines across South Africa, the vast majority of them found along the so-called Golden Arc \u2013 the elliptical basin that spans the breadth of Johannesburg and continues into the neighbouring Free State and North West provinces. Johannesburg, viewed from an old goldmine dump Most of these sites have now been taken over by zama zamas and the violent syndicates that control them. The recent political and economic turmoil of some of South Africa\u2019s neighbours coupled with the inability of the ruling African National Congress to regulate the country\u2019s informal mining sector has compounded the issue, pushing an increasing number of unskilled new arrivals into this perilous world. Between 2011 and 2016, Gauteng province, which comprises Johannesburg, also added almost a million new inhabitants through net migration from other South African provinces. The country\u2019s most urbanised province is expected to accept a million more internal migrants by 2021, the vast majority emanating from the still-underdeveloped former rural \u201chomelands\u201d created by the apartheid regime to segregate the non-white population from urban centres. But with Johannesburg already experiencing a severe housing shortage and the national unemployment rate sitting at 29%, many of the new migrants, both local and international, are pushed into the growing expanse of outlying informal settlements, where opportunities for formal employment are particularly scant. Poor migrants, many of them from Zimbabwe, have moved into dilapidated bungalows in Durban Deep\u2019s old mining village. Photographs: Shaun Swingler In Durban Deep, a defunct Victorian-era goldmine on the western flank of Johannesburg, hundreds of poor migrants, mostly from Zimbabwe, have moved into the crumbling bungalows of former white mine employees. The once leafy and affluent mine village, and its recently shuttered golf course, are increasingly enveloped by two warren-like informal settlements. Together, they account for about 40,000 inhabitants and epidemic levels of violent crime often associated with mining syndicates. \u201cMaybe 85% of people in this area are making a living from illegal mining,\u201d says Fani, a middleman who resides in a dilapidated Durban Deep home and sells locally mined gold to pawnbrokers and jewellers from across the city, who will then launder it into the legal market for eventual export. According to David van Wyk, a mining researcher at the Johannesburg-based Bench Marks Foundation, there is a dependency ratio of about eight to 10 people per illegal miner. \u201cSo that\u2019s about 400,000 people who are dependent on small scale mining,\u201d he says. Kassim Bhorat: \u2018When the mine closed in 1999, business went down considerably.\u2019 . Photograph: Shaun Swingler This figure excludes local businesses in areas that have often experienced significant economic downturn and visible urban decay in the wake of formal mine closures. Many such businesses are now heavily reliant on zama zamas for trade. Kassim Bhorat\u2019s grandfather bought a small convenience store near Durban Deep in 1958, when the mine was in its heyday, which Bhorat then took over and rebranded as an electronics outlet in 1990. \u201cWhen the mine closed in 1999, business went down considerably,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then about 10 years ago the zama zamas started moving in and that helped a lot. I imagine many other businesses around here would say the same.\u201d A group of zama zamas from Zimbabwe work behind the informal settlement of Matholesville. . Photograph: Shaun Swingler In the nearby settlement of Matholesville, scores of vendors sit on crowded street corners selling headlamps, balaclavas, knee pads and other essentials to a clientele almost unanimously looking to carve out its existence underground. \u201cYou have entire subsidiary industries developing around sites where illegal mining occurs,\u201d Robert Thornton, a Wits University anthropologist who specialises in illegal mining, told local media in 2017. Numerous zama zamas, activists and researchers claim that local police also profit from this underground economy by taking bribes and kickbacks from buyers and syndicates, or by confiscating gold from the zama zamas only to sell it themselves. \u201cThe cops just want money,\u201d says Fani. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about law enforcement.\u201d The town of Carletonville outside of Johannesburg has been hit hard by the collapse of formal mining. Photographs: Shaun Swingler A short drive beyond the city limits, the town of Carletonville and many of the former mining villages that surround it, until recently the bedrock of Gauteng\u2019s formal mining sector, have fallen into a similar state of abandonment. A number of run-down properties and scruffy sections of road around the town have been partially swallowed by sinkholes, which locals say often appear after bouts of tremors resulting from activity at the diminished number of still-functional local mines. Thabo Dikgang, a zama zama from Carletonville, processes gold outside his home. Photographs: Shaun Swingler Combined with the hulking unrehabilitated mine dumps that enfold Carletonville and kick up great clouds of toxic dust when the wind blows, the area has a decidedly dystopian feel and provides a stark depiction of the death rattle of the formal mining industry. In 2017 alone, as many as 8,500 people were retrenched from formal mines in Carletonville, with most of those who could afford to do so joining the growing exodus into Johannesburg. Rethabile Mokwena is a broker between local zama zamas and a wealthy buyer from the city. Photograph: Shaun Swingler Rethabile Mokwena used to work as a local contractor for Sibanye-Stillwater, the largest individual producer of gold from South Africa. He now makes a meagre living as a broker between local zama zamas and a wealthy Zimbabwean buyer from the city. He undertakes the laborious and hazardous process of refining gold dust into amalgam with a blowtorch and mercury in a small corrugated zinc shack, or \u201cburn house\u201d, behind his one-bedroom home in a sand-swept township on the edge of Carletonville. Mokwena says he has problems with his lungs as a result of the work. According to Nhlengethwa, the gold is usually extracted from silica-based rock, which can cause silicosis, a chronic lung disease that has claimed the lives of thousands of mine workers since the 1960s. \u201cThe large-scale mining companies have a way to mitigate that risk by providing proper protective gear to avoid inhaling those particles,\u201d she says. \u201cThe zama zamas do not.\u201d Aside from the health risks, Mokwena says that police regularly raid his house and confiscate any gold and cash they find. \u201cBut they won\u2019t arrest you,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019ll just sell your stuff to other buyers.\u201d \u201cThere is no other work,\u201d says Thabo Dikgang, a burly local zama zama whose earnings support a wife and five children. \u201cEven if someone dies inside those shafts today, someone else will be there to take his place tomorrow.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

But what about his family\u2019s? There is a growing interest in the idea of transgenerational trauma (TGT) \u2013 trauma that is somehow transmitted from parent to child and on down the generations.</p> \n<p>Saleem is careful with his children, and probably even over-protective of them. What about others? He knows men who can\u2019t stop themselves from raging at the children, shouting, lashing out. \u201cSometimes the children are the same way. They see how their fathers are and they think this is the way to be.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Joseph El-Khoury, a Lebanese psychiatrist who works with members of the militias that fought in the conflicts that have shaken Lebanon over the last 50 years, Saleem\u2019s account is no surprise. The men he deals with are \u201cvery angry and resentful, and what they choose, a lot of them, is just to completely withdraw, do the minimum \u2026 you\u2019ve learned that by serving or being part of a group you sacrificed yourself, lost friends, and you\u2019re not better off.\u201d</p> \n<p>The resentment, the anger, he says, is being taught to a newer, younger generation. \u201cThey hold the political views and the social views that link to that conflict, but they don\u2019t make that connection.\u201d You can see it in small ways, he says. For example, in the geography of the town, or who hangs out where. \u201cThere are no barriers but there are mental barriers, psychological barriers.\u201d </p> \n<h2>\u2018You internalise that, and it becomes you\u2019</h2> \n<p>Trauma is what happens in our mind as a result of a particular event or series of events. It will affect different people differently: some may be fine or suffer only a few consequences, while for others the effects may evolve into post-traumatic stress disorder or depression. For many years conflict was seen as the main culprit, but increasingly physical and sexual abuse are thought to be triggers too.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/13/the-link-between-stress-and-depression-and-the-10-simple-words-that-could-help\">The link between stress and depression \u2026 and the 10 simple words that could help</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOne aspect of suffering one or several traumas,\u201d says Peter Fonagy, a psychoanalyst, clinical psychologist and head of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, \u201cis a greater susceptibility to stress.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 1966 a Montreal-based psychiatrist called <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/56369661.pdf\">Vivian Rakoff </a><a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/56369661.pdf\">noted</a> that he was seeing greater numbers of adolescent offspring of Holocaust survivors. \u201cIt is almost as if their parents, in an attempt to justify their survival, demanded qualities of their children which were the accumulation of their expectations of all the dead who were murdered,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Since then there have been many studies looking at, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180409161302.htm\">children of holocaust survivors</a>, on the <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-12128-007\">grandchildren of holocaust survivors</a>, the children of prisoners of war<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/11215\"> in the US civil war</a>, on families <a href=\"https://www.cvsni.org/media/1164/young-peoples-transgenerational-issues-in-ni-april-2012.pdf\">in Northern Ireland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21615769\">in the Middle East</a>. There is also a growing body of research into more indirect impacts in large historical traumas such as the eviction of <a href=\"http://tpcjournal.nbcc.org/examining-the-theory-of-historical-trauma-among-native-americans/\">Native Americans from the land</a>, or the enslavement and <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271597832_The_intergenerational_trauma_of_slavery_and_its_aftermath\">transport of Africans</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b1b558fcd5946932239ecb7cdf50288d52c86a4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b1b558fcd5946932239ecb7cdf50288d52c86a4/0_362_3584_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Derry in 1971 showing people being lined up against a wire fence by british soldiers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Derry in 1971.

There are studies which do find negative impacts - that the children of holocaust survivors, for example, can experience emotional problems of their own, <a href=\"https://psychotherapy.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2003.57.4.519\">difficulties in relationships</a>, in the way they function. Researchers in Northern Ireland concluded that the transmission of trauma to children of victims of the Troubles made them more prone to developing <a href=\"https://www.cvsni.org/media/1171/towards-a-better-future-march-2015.pdf\">toxic stress in childhood</a>. But some research has ended up in an entirely different place, finding that trauma in a parents\u2019 life can lead to <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Secondary-salutogenic-effects-in-veterans-whose-Dekel-Solomon/bdf64b65e5cb63a684239ac41ebecd4691e8b975\">higher resilience in children</a>. And yet more studies have concluded that there is <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1025706427300\">no clear effect</a> whatsoever.</p> \n<p>If trauma is being passed from one generation to the next, what is the mechanism of transmission? Some interesting work is being done around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2014/apr/25/epigenetics-beginners-guide-to-everything\">epigenetics</a> \u2013 the idea that the trauma may cause genetic changes that are then transmitted to your offspring. But epigenetics is a young and and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/19/epigenetics-dna--darwin-adam-rutherford\">still unproven</a> field.</p> \n<p>The main mechanism appears to be simply the parenting style of the traumatised parent. Basically, are they a good mum or dad?</p> \n<p>Fonagy says that, in an ideal world, as a baby you have a primary caregiver who mirrors you \u2013 who smiles when you smile, and so on. \u201cYou internalise that and it becomes you.\u201d The problems arise when the parent is unable, perhaps because of trauma, to perform that role.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you have someone who has been very neglected, where no one has held up a mirror, then you have a gap there, a blank, a nothing. And when you are maltreated, you take that experience of maltreatment as you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Research on rats has shown that when mothers are stressed in pregnancy or do not care properly for their babies, the offspring <a href=\"https://developingchild.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/Stress_Disrupts_Architecture_Developing_Brain-1.pdf\">tend to get more stressed</a> themselves, impairing memory and learning abilities.</p> \n<h2>What can be done?</h2> \n<p>If trauma can be transmitted down through the generations, what kind of mitigation can be done? Some countries have recognised the potential dangers and are trying to stem them. Much work has been done in Northern Ireland, for example, to mitigate the effect of the Troubles on the older and younger generations.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://wavetraumacentre.org.uk/who-we-are/our-funders/\">Wave trauma centres</a> are government- and EU-funded centres that provide counselling and psychotherapy and also run community courses on the impact that trauma can have on the family.</p> \n<p>But in Lebanon, resources are thinner. For every 100,000 people, Lebanon has roughly three psychologists and three mental health nurses. Western nations typically have scores or even hundreds.</p> \n<p>Stigma aggravates the problem, says El-Khoury. \u201cWe struggle to get people into clinics because they fear the stigma of seeing a psychiatrist.\u201d </p> \n<p>Fonagy suggests the best possible treatment for trauma is not professional but social. Social networks, community, family, trusting relationships can help people to develop the capacity to reflect and overcome their experiences.</p> \n<p>\u201cAdversity turns into trauma when the mind experiences itself as being in isolation,\u201d says Fonagy. \u201cThe tragedy is, of course, that the very experience that caused the trauma \u2013 like war \u2013 will destroy the social networks needed to overcome it.\u201d</p>",

He has remarried but he doesn\u2019t speak to his new wife about the war. \u201cI don\u2019t like to leave the children,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be outside the house at night. For years and years I didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all, but now I look online at night to try to understand.\u201d Saleem\u2019s experiences since the war sounds familiar to researchers who deal with post-traumatic stress disorder. But what about his family\u2019s? There is a growing interest in the idea of transgenerational trauma (TGT) \u2013 trauma that is somehow transmitted from parent to child and on down the generations. Saleem is careful with his children, and probably even over-protective of them. What about others? He knows men who can\u2019t stop themselves from raging at the children, shouting, lashing out. \u201cSometimes the children are the same way. They see how their fathers are and they think this is the way to be.\u201d For Joseph El-Khoury, a Lebanese psychiatrist who works with members of the militias that fought in the conflicts that have shaken Lebanon over the last 50 years, Saleem\u2019s account is no surprise. The men he deals with are \u201cvery angry and resentful, and what they choose, a lot of them, is just to completely withdraw, do the minimum \u2026 you\u2019ve learned that by serving or being part of a group you sacrificed yourself, lost friends, and you\u2019re not better off.\u201d The resentment, the anger, he says, is being taught to a newer, younger generation. \u201cThey hold the political views and the social views that link to that conflict, but they don\u2019t make that connection.\u201d You can see it in small ways, he says. For example, in the geography of the town, or who hangs out where. \u201cThere are no barriers but there are mental barriers, psychological barriers.\u201d \u2018You internalise that, and it becomes you\u2019 Trauma is what happens in our mind as a result of a particular event or series of events. It will affect different people differently: some may be fine or suffer only a few consequences, while for others the effects may evolve into post-traumatic stress disorder or depression. For many years conflict was seen as the main culprit, but increasingly physical and sexual abuse are thought to be triggers too. \u201cOne aspect of suffering one or several traumas,\u201d says Peter Fonagy, a psychoanalyst, clinical psychologist and head of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, \u201cis a greater susceptibility to stress.\u201d In 1966 a Montreal-based psychiatrist called Vivian Rakoff noted that he was seeing greater numbers of adolescent offspring of Holocaust survivors. \u201cIt is almost as if their parents, in an attempt to justify their survival, demanded qualities of their children which were the accumulation of their expectations of all the dead who were murdered,\u201d he said. Since then there have been many studies looking at, for example, the children of holocaust survivors, on the grandchildren of holocaust survivors, the children of prisoners of war in the US civil war, on families in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East. There is also a growing body of research into more indirect impacts in large historical traumas such as the eviction of Native Americans from the land, or the enslavement and transport of Africans. The results are not entirely clear. There are studies which do find negative impacts - that the children of holocaust survivors, for example, can experience emotional problems of their own, difficulties in relationships, in the way they function. Researchers in Northern Ireland concluded that the transmission of trauma to children of victims of the Troubles made them more prone to developing toxic stress in childhood. But some research has ended up in an entirely different place, finding that trauma in a parents\u2019 life can lead to higher resilience in children. And yet more studies have concluded that there is no clear effect whatsoever. If trauma is being passed from one generation to the next, what is the mechanism of transmission? Some interesting work is being done around epigenetics \u2013 the idea that the trauma may cause genetic changes that are then transmitted to your offspring. But epigenetics is a young and and still unproven field. The main mechanism appears to be simply the parenting style of the traumatised parent. Basically, are they a good mum or dad? Fonagy says that, in an ideal world, as a baby you have a primary caregiver who mirrors you \u2013 who smiles when you smile, and so on. \u201cYou internalise that and it becomes you.\u201d The problems arise when the parent is unable, perhaps because of trauma, to perform that role. \u201cWhen you have someone who has been very neglected, where no one has held up a mirror, then you have a gap there, a blank, a nothing. And when you are maltreated, you take that experience of maltreatment as you.\u201d Research on rats has shown that when mothers are stressed in pregnancy or do not care properly for their babies, the offspring tend to get more stressed themselves, impairing memory and learning abilities. What can be done? If trauma can be transmitted down through the generations, what kind of mitigation can be done? Some countries have recognised the potential dangers and are trying to stem them. Much work has been done in Northern Ireland, for example, to mitigate the effect of the Troubles on the older and younger generations. The Wave trauma centres are government- and EU-funded centres that provide counselling and psychotherapy and also run community courses on the impact that trauma can have on the family. But in Lebanon, resources are thinner. For every 100,000 people, Lebanon has roughly three psychologists and three mental health nurses. Western nations typically have scores or even hundreds. Stigma aggravates the problem, says El-Khoury. \u201cWe struggle to get people into clinics because they fear the stigma of seeing a psychiatrist.\u201d Fonagy suggests the best possible treatment for trauma is not professional but social. Social networks, community, family, trusting relationships can help people to develop the capacity to reflect and overcome their experiences. \u201cAdversity turns into trauma when the mind experiences itself as being in isolation,\u201d says Fonagy. \u201cThe tragedy is, of course, that the very experience that caused the trauma \u2013 like war \u2013 will destroy the social networks needed to overcome it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The five biggest oil and gas companies, and their industry groups, have spent at least \u20ac251m (\u00a3217m) lobbying the European Union over climate policies since 2010, research has revealed. The data on the scale of lobbying by oil companies and their representatives comes as 200 organisations demand the setting up of a firewall around democratic politics to protect it from the influence of the fossil fuel industry. Declarations from the EU\u2019s transparency register reveal BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total have registered spending \u20ac123m between 2010 and 2018 on lobbying EU institutions, the report by a coalition of NGOs reveals. Their 13 industry groups declared spending a further \u20ac128m in the same period. In total, between 2010 and 2018 the companies and their lobbying industry bodies have spent at least \u20ac251.3m on lobbying activities within EU institutions, according to the report by Corporate Europe Observatory, Food &amp; Water Europe, Friends of the Earth Europe and Greenpeace. The researchers say the figure represents the tip of the iceberg, as in some years companies made no declarations of spending in the voluntary register. The report also does not examine lobbying spending by each company relating to national parliaments and institutions. Analysis of the European commission\u2019s public record of meetings shows the oil firms and their industry groups employ 200 lobbyists in Brussels, who have held 327 meetings with top EC officials since 2014, when Jean-Claude Juncker took office \u2013 the equivalent of more than one meeting per week. At the same time, the profits of the big five have continued to rise to more than $82bn (\u00a362bn) in 2018. Pascoe Sabido, researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, said: \u201cBig polluters like Shell, BP and their lobby groups have delayed, weakened and sabotaged EU action on the climate emergency thanks to their hefty lobby spending. A cool quarter of a billion over the last decade buys a lot of access and influence in Brussels.\u201d The report comes after the Guardian\u2019s Polluters series, which revealed that 20 oil and gas companies \u2013 including BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total \u2013 can be directly linked to a third of greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. The companies \u2013 which include multinationals and state-owned firms \u2013 are continuing to expand their operations and driving the climate emergency, despite having been aware for decades of their industry\u2019s devastating impact on the planet. The report says the lobbying has succeeded in watering down EU climate legislation. Lobbying, it says, peaks at times when legislation is being drawn up. The oil and gas companies, and their industry groups had high spending in 2014 during the discussions over the EU\u2019s 2030 climate targets, when they spent \u20ac34.3m on lobbying the EU institutions. The report says the climate targets were weakened as a result; they included no binding energy savings target and included a \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d renewable energy target. The Guardian recently revealed how the car industry and big oil companies are the most negative influencers on climate policy of all the top 250 biggest investor-owned industry and their trading associations. The NGOs behind the report are demanding that politics be freed from fossil fuel influence. In a call, supported by 200 civil society organisations, they said they wanted to see an end to the fossil fuel industry accessing decision making. They are calling for: an end to lobbying meetings with fossil fuel and their representatives no revolving door between public office and the oil and gas industry the end of fossil fuel subsidies no sponsorships or partnerships with industry representatives The call to set up a firewall between the fossil fuel industry and democratic politics comes as pressure is growing on the oil and gas industry. The US Congress held a hearing on Wednesday examining the oil industry\u2019s efforts to suppress the truth about the climate emergency. In New York, a supreme court trial opened this week examining allegations that ExxonMobil misled its investors about climate change. In the UK, BP and Shell have faced a growing backlash. This month the Royal Shakespeare Company announced it was ending its sponsorship deal with BP and the National Theatre said it would end its Shell sponsorship in the new year. Sebastian Mang, climate policy adviser for Greenpeace Europe, said: \u201cBig oil and gas are causing death and destruction in exchange for eye-watering profits. But millions of people are calling them out, as they face trial for their role in fuelling the climate emergency \u2026 It\u2019s time our governments hold them to account.\u201d A spokesperson for Chevron said: \u201cWe lobby ethically, constructively and in a nonpartisan manner.

We are crystal clear about our support for the Paris agreement, the European commission\u2019s vision to achieve EU climate neutrality by 2050 and the steps we are taking to help meet society\u2019s need for more and cleaner energy. ExxonMobil said: \u201cExxonMobil, like many companies, non-governmental organisations and other entities, engages with the European institutions. We have a responsibility to our customers, employees, communities and shareholders to engage in a public policy dialogue that impacts our business.\u201d The company said it complied with the requirements of the EU transparency register.

But Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School seeks to uncover stories like al-Humaizi\u2019s, which don\u2019t fit neatly into quick news hits, as more and more women take to the road.</p> <p>On a state level, the removal of the female driving ban seems like a rare progressive fluke for a country whose brazen flexes of state control have drawn international outrage; five weeks before the ban\u2019s end, the film notes, at least 10 female activists who publicly called for the change <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/21/further-arrests-saudi-arabia-womens-rights-activists-driving-ban\">were arrested and branded as traitors </a>in the state press.

Producers Nick London and Fiona Stourton had secured a rare filming visa based on the narrow focus of their project, a process begun in the weeks after King Salman announced the ban\u2019s end in fall 2017.</p> <p>The crew arrived in Saudi Arabia in mid-October 2018, and filmed on and off for three months. The team was, for the most part, surprisingly left to their own devices, said Gornall, although \u201cat the same time, there were other things that reminded you that film-making was very new, and a thing you have to be careful about.\u201d For example, she accidentally caused a scene by filming alone outside a crowded cafe. \u201cBut overall, it was a lot easier to film in Saudi Arabia than I thought it would be.\u201d</p> <p>The central hub of filming was the titular Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School in Riyadh, a looping maze of new drivers and instructors in white cars, and the gateway to certification for aspiring female drivers. Gornall and her crew followed several women at different levels of driving ability. For some, like Sarah Saleh, who works on an auto showroom floor but was not able to drive, a license offered freedom of mobility and the chance to actually drive a product she sells. For women like race-car driver Amjad Alamri and Uber driver al-Humaizi, the ban\u2019s end translated into career opportunities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"967e075d4749aceaba91ff19ede4848db234b99b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/967e075d4749aceaba91ff19ede4848db234b99b/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Saleh, the auto saleswoman who was unable to drive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Saleh, the auto saleswoman who was unable to drive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alamri, introduced to Gornall through a Saudi member of her film crew, began learning to drive long before the ban\u2019s end; now, she\u2019s a striking presence on the racetrack, inspecting her car, willing herself not to get too distracted on the turns. \u201cThe ambition after having so many barriers for years and years and being told no this isn\u2019t for you \u2013 she is one of those feminists who really is taking the bull by the horns,\u201d said Gornall.</p> <p>Meeting women such as Alamri and al-Humaizi was \u201cquite surprising\u201d, said Gornall. \u201cThere was quite a rebellious streak to some of the women we met.\u201d</p> <p>But that rebelliousness bumps into opposition beyond the high walls of the state.

      "bodyText": "About halfway through Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School, airing on HBO this week, the film looks as though it could be heading into a commercial break. Scenes in the sprawling, dust-cloaked capital of Riyadh give way to a magnificent desert ringed by sandstone plateaus. A single black Hyundai streaks through, trailing sand like a comet. In a scene worthy of a car ad, a woman, Shahad al-Humaizi, drives through the desert, sunglasses coolly in place. Natural grandeur, woman at the wheel \u2013 it\u2019s not an image often associated with Saudi Arabia and one only state-sanctioned since June 2018, when the country\u2019s King Salman formally lifted a decades-long ban on female drivers. But Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School seeks to uncover stories like al-Humaizi\u2019s, which don\u2019t fit neatly into quick news hits, as more and more women take to the road. On a state level, the removal of the female driving ban seems like a rare progressive fluke for a country whose brazen flexes of state control have drawn international outrage; five weeks before the ban\u2019s end, the film notes, at least 10 female activists who publicly called for the change were arrested and branded as traitors in the state press. Just months after the ban lifted, the brutal murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a consulate in Istanbul, which a UN report blames on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, drew widespread condemnation, as has the country\u2019s blockade on neighboring Yemen, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises of the decade. Still, as Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School demonstrates, on a micro level, the end of the driving ban is no small event for numerous women in the country, offering new opportunities for employment, mobility and passion. \u201cI felt that having only known about Saudi Arabia through a lot of western media reports,\u201d director Erica Gornall told the Guardian, \u201cI wanted to go there on the ground and meet these women we\u2019d seen on the news.\u201d Gornall, who has contributed to and directed several documentary projects for BBC2, joined the team behind Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School relatively late in the process, just weeks before they were due to depart for Riyadh. Producers Nick London and Fiona Stourton had secured a rare filming visa based on the narrow focus of their project, a process begun in the weeks after King Salman announced the ban\u2019s end in fall 2017. The crew arrived in Saudi Arabia in mid-October 2018, and filmed on and off for three months. The team was, for the most part, surprisingly left to their own devices, said Gornall, although \u201cat the same time, there were other things that reminded you that film-making was very new, and a thing you have to be careful about.\u201d For example, she accidentally caused a scene by filming alone outside a crowded cafe. \u201cBut overall, it was a lot easier to film in Saudi Arabia than I thought it would be.\u201d The central hub of filming was the titular Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School in Riyadh, a looping maze of new drivers and instructors in white cars, and the gateway to certification for aspiring female drivers. Gornall and her crew followed several women at different levels of driving ability. For some, like Sarah Saleh, who works on an auto showroom floor but was not able to drive, a license offered freedom of mobility and the chance to actually drive a product she sells. For women like race-car driver Amjad Alamri and Uber driver al-Humaizi, the ban\u2019s end translated into career opportunities. Alamri, introduced to Gornall through a Saudi member of her film crew, began learning to drive long before the ban\u2019s end; now, she\u2019s a striking presence on the racetrack, inspecting her car, willing herself not to get too distracted on the turns. \u201cThe ambition after having so many barriers for years and years and being told no this isn\u2019t for you \u2013 she is one of those feminists who really is taking the bull by the horns,\u201d said Gornall. Meeting women such as Alamri and al-Humaizi was \u201cquite surprising\u201d, said Gornall. \u201cThere was quite a rebellious streak to some of the women we met.\u201d But that rebelliousness bumps into opposition beyond the high walls of the state. Keeping to the film\u2019s small-scale focus, Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School visits the issue of driving, and women\u2019s rights at large, in individual conversations and family discussions.

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D\u2013NY) questioned Michael McGarrity, the FBI\u2019s assistant director for its counterterrorism division, about why the FBI doesn\u2019t treat white supremacists the way it treats other terrorists. @ocasio2018 pointed out that mass killings committed by white supremacists were considered hate crimes while similar massacres committed by Muslim killers were charged with terrorism.

Corporate Pac money</h2> \n<p>Ocasio-Cortez achieves the seemingly impossible: turning a discussion about the intricacies of campaign finance into a clear and immensely watchable three-minute video. The clip, which was uploaded by the leftwing channel NowThis news, has been viewed more than 37m times, making it the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/14/campaign-finance-but-make-it-viral-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-unlikely-video-hit\">most watched political video ever posted</a> to Twitter.</p> \n<p>She starts out with the proposition \u201clet\u2019s play a game\u201d \u2013 and off she goes.</p> \n<p>In this game, she is the self-interested bad guy, trying to make as much money as possible. She checks in every now and then with the panel of government watchdogs, to see how much she can get away with. The answer? Pretty much everything \u2013 playing into her point that of course the system is broken.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h810bO-4LIs\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h810bO-4LIs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. Green New Deal</h2> \n<p>After Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal failed to pass the Senate, she gave the GOP a supreme telling off by tearing down the presumption that only elites care about the environment. In the clip, she asks:</p> \n<p>\u201cYou want to tell people that their desire for clean air and water is elitist? \u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> \n<p>If she has already proven that she can act as a great game-show host and detective \u2013 here is proof that she excels in giving a lecture, too:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvhOzMilLGv/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "It isn\u2019t often that you hear someone rave about a great congressional hearing they\u2019ve seen online. Heck, outside of big national events, I\u2019m going to bet you have never willingly watched C-Span. But less than one year since she entered Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has represented New York\u2019s 14th congressional district since January, has changed that. AOC has shown a remarkable ability to extract energizing viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle. This is exactly what happened on Wednesday during her questioning of Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg about his early awareness of the disgraced political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested millions of Facebook users\u2019 personal information to influence the 2016 US election. The confrontation is uncomfortable to watch, with Ocasio-Cortez grilling Zuckerberg on key details about his knowledge back then \u2013 he denies having any \u2013 and then ending on the zinger: \u201cYou don\u2019t know? This was the largest data scandal with respect to your company, that had catastrophic impacts on the 2016 election. You don\u2019t know?\u201d She is met with a squirming Zuckerberg and therein, a viral moment is made. This wasn\u2019t her first time capturing people\u2019s attention with her line of questioning. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even her first time that day. 1. ExxonMobil Just hours before she made Zuckerberg eat his own words, AOC attended a hearing with the oil giant ExxonMobil. In the video, she shows Martin Hoffert, a consultant for the company, a graph he worked on from 1982 and asks him to describe it. Thus she gets him to explain how the company knew about climate change before she was even born \u2013 predicting its levels accurately until the present day. The stinger comes at the end, when Hoffert testifies: \u201cWe were excellent scientists,\u201d and she adds: \u201cYes. You were: so they knew.\u201d 2. White terrorism During this hearing, Ocasio-Cortez exposes an American double standard: that white supremacist acts of violence are treated as hate crimes, while similar violence committed by Muslims is treated as terrorism. Her cunning ability to use the FBI\u2019s own rhetoric against it is what makes it so watchable. She gets the bureau\u2019s assistant director for counter-terrorism to describe terrorism in his own terms, and then repeatedly uses his own definitions as a stick to beat him with. 3. Corporate Pac money Ocasio-Cortez achieves the seemingly impossible: turning a discussion about the intricacies of campaign finance into a clear and immensely watchable three-minute video. The clip, which was uploaded by the leftwing channel NowThis news, has been viewed more than 37m times, making it the most watched political video ever posted to Twitter. She starts out with the proposition \u201clet\u2019s play a game\u201d \u2013 and off she goes. In this game, she is the self-interested bad guy, trying to make as much money as possible. She checks in every now and then with the panel of government watchdogs, to see how much she can get away with. The answer? Pretty much everything \u2013 playing into her point that of course the system is broken. 4. Green New Deal After Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal failed to pass the Senate, she gave the GOP a supreme telling off by tearing down the presumption that only elites care about the environment. In the clip, she asks: \u201cYou want to tell people that their desire for clean air and water is elitist? \u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d If she has already proven that she can act as a great game-show host and detective \u2013 here is proof that she excels in giving a lecture, too:",

strike against its remuneration report \u2013 a 25% vote against that if repeated twice triggers a spill of the board \u2013 but appears to have been saved by votes from Packer, who owns 37% of Crown.</p> <p>In front of about 100 mostly older shareholders, the chairman, John Alexander, and other members of the Crown board repeatedly batted away questions raised by the anti-gambling activists Tim Costello and Stephen Mayne on issues ranging from allegations of favourable treatment of high-rollers by border officials to accusations organised crime has been involved in organising high-roller junkets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Packer\u2019s friend Lawrence Ho.</p> <p>Melco\u2019s attempts to buy almost 20% of Crown have been put on ice while New South Wales authorities <a

is too close to Ho\u2019s father, Stanley, who is banned from involvement with Crown\u2019s harbourside Barangaroo project over allegations, which he has always denied, of links to organised crime triads.</p> <p>Costello and Mayne, who dominated questions from the floor, also attacked the board and Alexander over Alexander\u2019s two-decade history as an employee of the Packer family and his continuing role as executive chairman \u2013 a role long abolished at most large listed companies in favour of an independent, non-executive chair.</p> <p>\u201cDo your job for the independent

opening address to launch a fresh salvo against reporting by Nine newspapers and the media company\u2019s flagship TV current affairs show, 60 Minutes, attacking \u201ca number of sensationalist and unproven claims made, with many focused on allegations from over five years ago\u201d.</p> <p>The meeting, which at times descended into farce, followed a year from hell for the company that is unlikely to improve next week when the former border force boss Roman Quaedvlieg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/23/roman-quaedvlieg-to-be-first-witness-at-hearings-into-crown-corruption-allegations\">gives evidence</a> at public hearings held as part of one of at least four different investigations into allegations surrounding Crown.</p> <p>Crown\u2019s high-roller revenue, traditionally a lucrative but unpredictable source of profit that adds cream to the steady stream of \u201cgrind\u201d revenue earned from poker machines, collapsed by 46% in the three months to the end of June, which Alexander put down to \u201cdifficult trading conditions in the international VIP market\u201d.</p> <p>Alexander said the fall in VIP revenue helped drive a tumble in the company\u2019s profit for the financial year from $573m to $403m.</p> <p>International casinos have been pummelled by a mainland Chinese crackdown on gambling over the past two years, including the 2016 arrest and imprisonment of 19 Crown staff for promoting gambling, which is illegal in China.</p> <p>The chief financial officer, Ken Barton, refused Mayne\u2019s offer to link the final-quarter VIP revenue plunge to the ongoing media firestorm.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some macroeconomic headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think this business is very hard to predict over a relatively short period of time.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander and other members of the board repeatedly claimed Crown was the most regulated company in Australia \u2013 a phrase Mitchell denied they were \u201cparroting\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI take objection to that, I have to say, that\u2019s not the way

      "bodyText": "Shareholders in the crisis-ridden gambling empire controlled by James Packer, Crown Resorts, have delivered hefty protest votes against two directors, the Minerals Council chair Helen Coonan and the media mogul Harold Mitchell, at an annual meeting dominated by questions about a wave of scandals threatening to engulf the group. The company also came close to earning a strike against its remuneration report \u2013 a 25% vote against that if repeated twice triggers a spill of the board \u2013 but appears to have been saved by votes from Packer, who owns 37% of Crown. In front of about 100 mostly older shareholders, the chairman, John Alexander, and other members of the Crown board repeatedly batted away questions raised by the anti-gambling activists Tim Costello and Stephen Mayne on issues ranging from allegations of favourable treatment of high-rollers by border officials to accusations organised crime has been involved in organising high-roller junkets. Other questions from the pair also dealt with the role at the company of Hong Kong\u2019s Melco, which owns 10% of Crown and is helmed by Packer\u2019s friend Lawrence Ho. Melco\u2019s attempts to buy almost 20% of Crown have been put on ice while New South Wales authorities investigate issues including whether the company is too close to Ho\u2019s father, Stanley, who is banned from involvement with Crown\u2019s harbourside Barangaroo project over allegations, which he has always denied, of links to organised crime triads. Costello and Mayne, who dominated questions from the floor, also attacked the board and Alexander over Alexander\u2019s two-decade history as an employee of the Packer family and his continuing role as executive chairman \u2013 a role long abolished at most large listed companies in favour of an independent, non-executive chair. \u201cDo your job for the independent shareholders and move away from a long-time loyal combative Packer employee who\u2019s been paid $73m,\u201d Mayne told independent directors. Alexander instead used his opening address to launch a fresh salvo against reporting by Nine newspapers and the media company\u2019s flagship TV current affairs show, 60 Minutes, attacking \u201ca number of sensationalist and unproven claims made, with many focused on allegations from over five years ago\u201d. The meeting, which at times descended into farce, followed a year from hell for the company that is unlikely to improve next week when the former border force boss Roman Quaedvlieg gives evidence at public hearings held as part of one of at least four different investigations into allegations surrounding Crown. Crown\u2019s high-roller revenue, traditionally a lucrative but unpredictable source of profit that adds cream to the steady stream of \u201cgrind\u201d revenue earned from poker machines, collapsed by 46% in the three months to the end of June, which Alexander put down to \u201cdifficult trading conditions in the international VIP market\u201d. Alexander said the fall in VIP revenue helped drive a tumble in the company\u2019s profit for the financial year from $573m to $403m. International casinos have been pummelled by a mainland Chinese crackdown on gambling over the past two years, including the 2016 arrest and imprisonment of 19 Crown staff for promoting gambling, which is illegal in China. The chief financial officer, Ken Barton, refused Mayne\u2019s offer to link the final-quarter VIP revenue plunge to the ongoing media firestorm. \u201cThere are some macroeconomic headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think this business is very hard to predict over a relatively short period of time.\u201d Alexander and other members of the board repeatedly claimed Crown was the most regulated company in Australia \u2013 a phrase Mitchell denied they were \u201cparroting\u201d. \u201cI take objection to that, I have to say, that\u2019s not the way we look at it,\u201d he said. He said the board had unanimously signed a full-page newspaper advertisement savaging Nine\u2019s coverage because if \u201cyou leave a void, someone else will fill it\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not bunkered down,\u201d he said. He said he didn\u2019t know why shareholders delivered a vote against him of more than 27% and said he was confident of beating a lawsuit against him in which the corporate regulator is trying to have him disqualified as a company director for allegedly helping Seven get a cheap deal to broadcast the Australian Open in 2013, when he was on the board of Tennis Australia. \u201cI deny vehemently any wrongdoing,\u201d he said. \u201cI fully expect to win these proceedings and clear my name.\u201d Coonan said a vote against her of almost 23%, delivered after advice to institutional shareholders by proxy advisers, was not related to her long list of roles at organisations including the Minerals Council and the new Australian Financial Complaints Authority, where she is chair. \u201cAs to the vote, I read very carefully the proxy advices and it appears the vote you refer to has nothing to do with my workload and has something to do with the audit and governance committee and the ratio of audit to non-audit fees,\u201d she said. Coonan chairs the audit and governance committee. Last year Crown paid big four accounting firm EY about $1.5m to audit the company, but an additional $4m for other services, mostly tax advice. She also blasted coverage of Crown\u2019s woes. \u201cThe unsubstantiated and unproven allegations that have been made against Crown have been deeply distressing to all of us,\u201d she said. About 17.7% of votes were cast against the remuneration report, meaning the company would have recorded a strike but for the votes held by Packer. \u201cSome people do not like what they claim to be high fixed remuneration, and I think when you look through most Australian companies it\u2019s not that high in any rate,\u201d the Crown director Geoff Dixon, who chairs the company\u2019s remuneration committee, told the meeting. The Crown director Andrew Demetriou was easily re-elected, and did not face any questions over his role at failed training group Acquire. Alexander also told the meeting Crown had settled a claim of a tax bill of almost $400m levied against it over its aborted attempt to buy US casino group Cannery in the late 2000s. Terms of the settlement with the tax office were confidential, he said.",

Baseball runs deep in the city and the story behind why they left for Washington is a complex one. Now, some 15 years later, Montreal is well on its way to hosting a MLB team again, either through expansion or franchise relocation. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/10/21/nationals-world-series-run-brings-cherished-expos-to-forefront/\">American press</a> has put together a series of articles discussing the team link to Montreal, but I was wondering what the vibe was like up in La Belle Province surrounding their former franchise, which has made the World Series for the first time. A quick peak at the Montreal Gazette, an English daily, reveals minimal coverage of the team. Matthew Ross, Chairman and Founder of ExposNation told the Guardian:</p> <p>\u201cWhile the roots of the Nationals are in Montreal, they were uprooted and didn\u2019t really look back once they left. Meanwhile, Montrealers never really looked at them as their team. They\u2019re as related to Montreal these days, as the Pirates are. Montrealers are more curious about the Rays, with the Sternberg 2024 sharing announcement over the summer.\u201d</p> <p>So it seems that despite the success of the Nats, the link is permanently broken. Now the city eagerly awaits the return of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youppi!\">Youppi</a> and the Expos. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-24T01:53:33.650Z\">at 2.53am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db0e13f8f0898437061b73b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T23:27:17.071Z\">12.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Astros off the field</strong></p> <p>Astros manager AJ Hinch has emerged as a bright spot during some dark days for the Houston Astros organization. </p> <p>Today he condemned the clubhouse actions of an Astros executive taken after their defeat of the Yankees in the ALCS. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019s uncalled for. For me as a leader in this organization down here in the clubhouse, on the field, I take everything that happens in the clubhouse to heart.\u201d<br><br>Hinch also said: \u201cNo one, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a player, a coach, a manager, any of you members of the media, should ever feel like when you come into our clubhouse that you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable or disrespected.\u201d<br><br>This is in stark contrast to the organization\u2019s initial response, releasing a statement which torpedoed the Sports Illustrated report as \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible\u201d. Of course, you can read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/23/houston-astros-washington-nationals-world-series-game-1-baseball\">Tom Dart\u2019s account about the ongoing situation here. </a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db0ba048f08c78d1cb4ffc9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T23:14:29.043Z\">12.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hola!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We all saw it coming: the roof rattling in Houston on Tuesday night in Game 1, the Astros in the midst of yet another roaring late-inning rally. The Nationals, rookies in the World Series game, were up a run in the home eighth, seemingly on their way to blowing a 5-2 lead and a chance to skip out of Houston\u2019s thunder-dome with a 1-0 lead. </p> <p>From there you could\u2019ve written the rest of the story rather easily: underdogs blow their big Series moment and there\u2019s no chance at a bounce back. Astros in five? After all, Houston\u2019s rollicking roster, so stacked in nearly every way, are as unforgiving as they come. </p> <p>And then it flipped. Sean Doolittle came on with two outs and overcame the decibels and Jose Altuve. Houston\u2019s engine, fresh off his ALCS winning walk-off home run, lined to right, leaving the tying run stranded at second. In the ninth, Doolittle struck out Alex Bregman before Yuli Gurriel and Carlos Correa popped out to end the game. </p> <p>Perhaps we should\u2019ve known. These Nats beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, a team that\u2019s supposed to be suiting up in their third consecutive World Series. Then Washington thoroughly embarrassed the St Louis Cardinals, another blue-blooded National League outfit. </p> <p>Now they\u2019ve walked into a loud and hostile room and walked out with a win. Aggressive managing from Dave Martinez helped: the Nats skipper summoned an inning from starter Patrick Corbin in the sixth to protect that lead. It may or may not impact their starting pitching plans for the rest of the Series, but the move worked and sent out a message to anyone still wondering if the Nats thought this Series was just gravy. </p> <p>Now it\u2019s the Astros, who came in as the biggest World Series favorites since 2007, who need to steady their yacht as they face the Nat\u2019s stingy ace, Stephen Strasburg, who\u2019s excelled in his seven postseason games. They\u2019ll throw another ace, Justin Verlander, who is making his 29th postseason start and did get touched up some by the Yankees last round. <br></p> <p>All shall be revealed shortly as we head into our coverage of Game 2 of the 115th World Series.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a look at the report from tonight\u2019s Game 2. Well the Nationals just walked into Houston and ripped two games away from a team that was meant to waltz to a second title in three seasons. Not so fast. Washington have won eight straight playoff games and 18 of their last 20 overall. The end result is that they are heading home, knowing that taking two of three games will bring the franchise its first World Series title. We will have more live game action on Friday night in addition to more traditional coverage. Until then, thank you for reading, and wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon or goodnight. Marisnick bounces out to third and this ballgame is over! Nationals 12-3 Astros, bottom 9th Springer chops to the left side of the infield and Rendon throws it away. The E5 extends the inning. Now Altuve has a base hit, and the Astros are content to waste all our time. Here is Jake Marisnick off the bench. Martin Maldonado hits a home run over the Fuddruckers sign in left, and I thought Fuddruckers were no longer with us. The train does its thing, which is admirable and sad at the same time. Now Reddick grounds out to second and the Astros are down to their final out. Nationals 12-2 Astros, bottom 9th Javy Guerra is in, and he entices a fly ball to center out of Correa. One down. Nationals 12-2 Astros, top 9th Parra skies to center. Inning over. Houston have three outs left. Michael Taylor with another blast, which leads to yet another celebration in the dugout. There\u2019s lots to admire with these Nats, including their consistency. Turner strikes out, and Parra enters off the bench. Nationals 11-2 Astros, top 9th Suzuki grounds out to cheers that are quite loud. Do they do Bronx cheers in Houston? Nationals 11-2 Astros, bottom 8th Rainey goes 1-2-3 after striking out Alvarez. To the ninth! Nationals 11-2 Astros, bottom 8th Oh, Rainey is in pitching now. I was getting cookies, which I think are allowed at this stage. There\u2019s more \u201call they gotta do is get back to Cole and Verlander\u201d type stuff from Smoltz, who clearly doesn\u2019t get what is happening right now. Gurriel flies out to center, two down. Here\u2019s Alvarez. Nationals 11-2 Astros, bottom 8th Bregman flies to right. The Nats are building good will everywhere. Nationals 11-2 Astros, top 8th Altuve makes a great tumbling stop at second to retire Zimmerman and end the inning. Cabrera\u2019s RBI single scores Soto. Their fans are undoubtedly asking them to save some runs for Game 3. Nationals 10-2 Astros, top 8th Kendrick singles, Soto moves to second, and Hinch is out to get James. We are in extensive gar-bage time, and it\u2019s ugly. Hector Rondon is in to face Cabrera. Down 0-2 FOX TV in the US tells us that there are just three teams to lose the first two World Series games at home and comeback to win it. They are: 1985 Kansas City Royals 1986 New York Mets 1996 New York Yankees So I am saying there\u2019s a chance, but that\u2019s not a pretty picture if you live in Houston. Nationals 10-2 Astros, top 8th Rendon strikes out, Soto walks. Adam Eaton just put one in the seats leading to yet another cabaret in the DC dugout. Houston, it would seem, have more than just one problem. They are getting creamed at home and now face a long flight to DC knowing their sure thing World Series title is anything but. A wild turn of events. Nationals 8-2 Astros, top 8th Robles strikes out but reaches on a past ball so he\u2019s on first. Here\u2019s Turner, who strikes out without reaching first. Eaton is next. Nationals 8-2 Astros, bottom 7th Strasburg is being hugged by four Nationals and deservedly so. Meanwhile, Altuve is popping out harmlessly to short. Two down for Brantley. Analyst John Smoltz is on FOX TV in the US giving \u201call Houston has to do...\u201d type of advice to the Astros. But what he doesn\u2019t seem to understand are the RPM\u2019s on the the buzzsaw they\u2019ve just run into. The Nats have barely lost since May and don\u2019t look like starting now. Vegas need to look in the mirror. Brantley grounds out to first, inning over. Nationals 8-2 Astros, bottom 7th Reddick walks, then Springer bounces into a 5-4 force out. One down with a man on for Altuve. Verlander 6IP 7H 4R 4ER 3BB 6SO 1HR Not what they were looking for out of Verlander says Captain Obvious Strasburg 6IP 7H 2H 2ER 1BB 7SO 1HR He was phenomenal after his rocky first, and held on through a tough sixth inning well over 100 pitches. Terrific outing. Nationals 8-2 Astros, bottom 7th So here\u2019s Fernando Rodney, which means Martinez is feeling really good about his chances. He faces Reddick to open the home seventh. True story... Nationals 8-2 Astros, top 7th Suzuki started this inning with a blast, and finishes it with a ground ball out to second. This inning is finally over, one that may live on in infamy for Houston and their fans! A roller to third, Bregman will have to hurry, he\u2019s got it and he throws it away! Two more are coming in for DC! What a nightmare inning, and especially so for Bregman! He needs to put that ball in his pocket but instead, he airmailed it! Here comes Hinch to get Pressly. Josh James will enter. What a mess in Houston! Cabrera: a line shot, right up the middle, and two more runs come in for the Nats! Turner is in, so is Soto! What an inning for Washington and it\u2019s crickets in Houston! Zimmerman steps in with two on and two out. Man, Bregman had to make that play...that\u2019s an E-5 even if they didn\u2019t score it that way. Ground ball to short, Bregman runs to his left and he can\u2019t get it! Robles scores and the Nats have a two run lead! He\u2019s gotta make that play! And the bases are still loaded for Cabrera! Oh boy... Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Rendon skies to center - is it deep enough? It is not! They won\u2019t run on Springer and that\u2019s just what Houston needed. That is also the argument agains the sac bunt. Anyway, now they intentionally walk Soto, which is absolutely the right move, and they will take their chances with Kendrick. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Conservative: Eaton lays down a sac bunt that advances the runners. Am I allowed to like that move? Here\u2019s Rendon - swallow hard Houston. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Ball four! Two on, no outs. Here\u2019s Eaton. They are reviewed, but you\u2019re not alone in this department. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Now Robles walks and here comes AJ Hinch to speak to Verlander. That will do it for Verlander, who had it for five innings tonight, but not in the first and not in the seventh. He is on the hook ands here comes Pressly in relief: heis operating with something of a balky knee. Tough sledding ahead, here comes Turner. Kurt Suzuki launches one to deep left center and that\u2019s way out of here! There\u2019s a dance party in the DC dugout as the visitors go on top! Wow! Astros blink first! Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Oh nasty! Strasburg floats a full-count curveball over the plate and Tucker can\u2019t handle it! Strike three - huge stones from Strasburg, who is almost definitely done after 114 pitches. Great for Martinez to stick with him through late game trouble - old school! Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Full count: the merry-go-round will be in motion! Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Check swing, did he go? Yes! It\u2019s 2-2 to Tucker... Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Broken bat, little fly ball a little north of second base and Strasburg survives Correa. Here\u2019s Tucker, who will pinch hit for the catcher Chirinos. Pitching coach Paul Manhart is on the hill to chat with Strasburg. Tucker had a big hit last night as the Astros rallied in the eighth. Two on, two out. How will it end? Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Full count! Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Alvarez is intentionally walked to face Correa, which, despite the righty, righty thing, strikes me as a lotta bit crazy, regardless of his struggles. Two on, one out. Here we go! Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Gurriel laces a shot down the third base line, just fair! He\u2019s at second base with a one out double and with Strasburg approaching 100 pitches, the wheels begin to turn for Nats manager Dave Martinez. Here\u2019s Alvarez trying to cash in. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 6th Bregman steps in to face Strasburg and grounds out routinely to short: that\u2019s a big first out. Here\u2019s the Cuban Gurriel as the Nats Hurler continues to cruise. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 6th Routine grounder to short is no problem for Correa - Verlander is through six approaching 100 pitches. No reason to not bring him out for the seventh and go batter by batter. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 6th Kendrick lines to center where Springer makes an easy play. Then Cabrera strikes out, Verlander\u2019s sixth of the evening. Now it\u2019s up to Zimmerman in the away sixth. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 5th Brantley hits a drive to center, back goes Robles to the edge of the outfield grass and he\u2019s under it to make the catch. That\u2019s a loud inning ending out for Houston, who have stranded four to DC\u2019s five runners. To the sixth! Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 5th Altuve is getting the regular treatment leading off of first. 1-2 to Brantley. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 5th Now Altuve has a two-out knock and here\u2019s Brantley up to keep the inning alive. Strasburg up to 83 pitches... Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 5th Line drive hit on the screws, Turner, on one knee picks it from the dirt, gets up and throws out Springer for the out. What a play by Turner right there! Fantastic. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 5th Reddick opens the home fifth with a sharp grounder to first, which is handled easily by Zimmerman. One down. Springer is next. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th A tapper to first results in an easy out and Verlander escapes the wrath of Soto...for now. His 83rd pitch of the game retires the side. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th These people are crazy, insisting on pitching to Soto. It\u2019s 2-2 now. He watches a fastball low. Full count, Rendon will run with the pitch. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th Rendon walks and that brings up Soto. They\u2019re pitching to him, again. It\u2019s 2-0. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th Ground ball to short - Correra has it, takes a short step to second, throws to first, double play! I told you he should have stolen second! Here\u2019s Rendon with nobody on, just how Houston likes it. Hadn\u2019t seen this one before... Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th On an 0-2 offering, Turner flips one into the opposite field (right), and that\u2019s a leadoff hit. He may try to get steal second, but with base runners rare, I wouldn\u2019t try with the meat of the order coming up. Here\u2019s Eaton. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Oh my. Chirinos chases a change up that dropped quickly. That ends the mild threat. Strasburg has six strikeouts and 72 pitches. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Correa, a grounder to third, Rendon runs in to his right and has it, throws to first and that\u2019s the second out. Now it\u2019s up to Chirinos. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Alvarez grounds a ball into right field, just beyond the reach of a diving Cabrera who was once again in the shift. That\u2019s a one-out baserunner and here is Carlos Correa trying to get his sleeping bat going. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Meanwhile, Strasburg is dealing, getting Gurriel to chase high heat for his fifth strikeout of the night. Now it\u2019s Alvarez with one down. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 4th Robles pops to second. Verlander cruising. Inning over. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 4th Zimmerman grounds on the left side of the infield, Verlander chases, slides, has the ball throws and...hits his own leg? He threw the ball into his own leg. Haven\u2019t seen that one before. One on, one out for Suzuki, who promptly skies to left where a chasing Brantly sticks up his glove and makes the catch. Two down for Robles. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 4th Cabrera chases up and away for his second strikeout, Verlander\u2019s fifth of the night. Here\u2019s Zimmerman, the first non-Expos draft pick for the relocated Nats. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Bregman bounces to short - Turner has it, flips to second for the force, and Washington survive the error. To the fourth we go! Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Brantley loops one just beyond the outstretched arm of Cabrera who is out in shallow right. That moves Altuve to third and brings up Alex Bregman, who hit a colossal shot in his last at-bat. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Strasburg is watching Altuve closely, throwing repeated to first. Meanwhile it\u2019s 1-2 to Brantley. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Altuve grounds to shot - Turner can\u2019t handle it, picks it up and fires on a bounce which Zimmerman can\u2019t pick! So it\u2019s a two-out E-6 which opens a door for Houston. Here\u2019s Brantley to try and make them pay. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Reddick can\u2019t handle a change-up low and away and strikes out. Then Springer skies an infield pop up for the second out. Now it\u2019s up to Altuve, who had a double back in the first. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 3rd Kendrick pops up and Verlander is walking off the mound well before the ball is caught in right. Chutzpah! He survives the two-out double: inning over. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 3rd Do they listen? No. They pitch to him. Soto muscles a pitch into the right field corner, turns the corner at first and cruises into second with a two out double. Why? Kendrick is here to try and bring the 20-year-old Ruthian slugger home. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 3rd Rendon grounds to second, Altuve is there, makes the grab and fires over to first for the second out. Here\u2019s the dangerous Soto. Don\u2019t pitch to him! Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 3rd Eaton pops out to center and that will bring up Rendon, who had a two-run double in the first. The soon to be extremely wealthy infielder is down in the count 1-2 after whiffing at a Verlander cheddar. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Chirinos is completely overmatched, striking out to end the inning. So both aces put up zeros after being touched up in the opening frame, which is what we like to call settling in. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Correa looks at a filthy curveball for strike three: now the Astros catcher Robinson Chirinos is up with two outs and the bases empty. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Alvarez lines a shot into shallow right but a diving Cabrera, not known for his defense, makes a terrific stab, whilst in the defensive shift, for the out. One down for Correa. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 2nd Fans are up in Houston as Verlander gets ahead 0-2. Turner pops to right and that\u2019s inning over, a better, and more efficient one for Verlander who is on 36 pitches. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 2nd Now here\u2019s the Nats catcher Kurt Suzuki who drives a fastball to center for a base hit. So it\u2019s one out and one on for Victor Robles. He lunges at a fastball out of the strikezone for the K. Two down. Top of the lineup - here\u2019s Turner, who lead off this game with a walk. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 2nd Ryan Zimmerman strikes out as Verlander resumes regular service, during a sequence that featured a silly, 78mph lollipop curveball that was awesome. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 1st Gurriel grounds out to third to end a juicy first inning at Minute Maid Park (yeah, I said it). Alex Bregman swings, tosses his bat, peeks at his teammates and watches it fly - a home run way, WAY out in left! It\u2019s a huge blast for the struggling MVP candidate and a huge confidence boost for the suddenly raging Astros faithful. Nationals 2-0 Astros, bottom 1st Michael Brantley has a two-out single that might have scored Altuve, had he been on base. Instead Houston have a two out runner for Bregman. Nationals 2-0 Astros, bottom 1st Altuve is stealing third, and he\u2019s out! Why? What is that about? He\u2019s going to score on a single, probably. That seems desperate. Why are the Astros acting desperate? They must be seriously concerned about Strasburg. Nationals 2-0 Astros, bottom 1st Springer whiffs on a nasty Strasburg curveball but then Altuve loops a pitch to left and that\u2019s off the wall! Altuve strolls into second with a one out double and the crowd is alive again in Houston. Nationals 2-0 Astros, top 1st Some 21 pitches later, Verlander walks off the mound after a rocky first frame after Cabrera strikes out. It could have been worse... Nationals 2-0 Astros, top 1st Kendrick pops out to right, two down, and now it\u2019s up to Asdrubal Cabrera. Nationals 2-0 Astros, top 1st Soto strikes out: that is an absolute miracle considering how he has been hitting. Kendrick the DH is next with a man in scoring position and one out. Anthony Rendon lines a shot off the top of the left field wall - here comes Turner, Eaton is right behind him! It\u2019s a two-RBI double for the Nats star third baseman (who once said he thought baseball was boring). DC are up early and now, here is Juan Soto, who I would walk immediately, I don\u2019t care what the situation is. Here\u2019s why... Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Now Eaton lines a ground ball to the left of a lunging Bregman at third for a base hit. FOX TV in the US tells us that Verlander has had his issues in the first inning - that\u2019s holding true right now, and here comes Rendon with two on and nobody out. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Turner is on with a four-pitch walk, which is not really what nervous Astros fans were looking for. The runner is a threat to steal. Let\u2019s see how aggressive Martinez is early. Verlander is paying some attention to him, throwing over twice already. And we\u2019re off! Verlander fires a high fastball to Turner so start Game 2 of the World Series! Houston Astros lineup Yeah, it\u2019s just one game, but there\u2019s a wee bit of pressure on these folks tonight. 1. George Springer, CF 2. Jose Altuve, 2B 3. Michael Brantley, LF 4. Alex Bregman, 3B 5. Yuli Gurriel, 1B 6. Yordan Alvarez, DH 7. Carlos Correa, SS 8. Robinson Chirinos, C 9.

Kurt Suzuki, C 9. Victor Robles, CF National Anthem Airman First Class Leah Fox of the USAF performed the national anthem. It was classic and strong. Who needs celebrities? I give her an 8/10. Here\u2019s the latest on Rob Drake from Guardian sport. Danger lurking for Houston? I believe him. The body of work from these Nats since the opening stages is strong: the Vegas folks who made them huge underdogs should be thinking twice right about now. A tweet from Major League umpire Rob Drake is making news before Game 2 of the World Series. Obviously that is extremely unsettling, and the Guardian will have more coverage as the story develops. The truth about Montreal As many of you know, the Nats were born abroad, more specifically in Montreal, where they played from 1969 until the conclusion of the 2004 season. Baseball runs deep in the city and the story behind why they left for Washington is a complex one. Now, some 15 years later, Montreal is well on its way to hosting a MLB team again, either through expansion or franchise relocation. The American press has put together a series of articles discussing the team link to Montreal, but I was wondering what the vibe was like up in La Belle Province surrounding their former franchise, which has made the World Series for the first time. A quick peak at the Montreal Gazette, an English daily, reveals minimal coverage of the team. Matthew Ross, Chairman and Founder of ExposNation told the Guardian: \u201cWhile the roots of the Nationals are in Montreal, they were uprooted and didn\u2019t really look back once they left. Meanwhile, Montrealers never really looked at them as their team. They\u2019re as related to Montreal these days, as the Pirates are. Montrealers are more curious about the Rays, with the Sternberg 2024 sharing announcement over the summer.\u201d So it seems that despite the success of the Nats, the link is permanently broken. Now the city eagerly awaits the return of Youppi and the Expos. Astros off the field Astros manager AJ Hinch has emerged as a bright spot during some dark days for the Houston Astros organization. Today he condemned the clubhouse actions of an Astros executive taken after their defeat of the Yankees in the ALCS. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019s uncalled for. For me as a leader in this organization down here in the clubhouse, on the field, I take everything that happens in the clubhouse to heart.\u201d Hinch also said: \u201cNo one, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a player, a coach, a manager, any of you members of the media, should ever feel like when you come into our clubhouse that you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable or disrespected.\u201d This is in stark contrast to the organization\u2019s initial response, releasing a statement which torpedoed the Sports Illustrated report as \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible\u201d. Of course, you can read Tom Dart\u2019s account about the ongoing situation here. We all saw it coming: the roof rattling in Houston on Tuesday night in Game 1, the Astros in the midst of yet another roaring late-inning rally. The Nationals, rookies in the World Series game, were up a run in the home eighth, seemingly on their way to blowing a 5-2 lead and a chance to skip out of Houston\u2019s thunder-dome with a 1-0 lead. From there you could\u2019ve written the rest of the story rather easily: underdogs blow their big Series moment and there\u2019s no chance at a bounce back. Astros in five? After all, Houston\u2019s rollicking roster, so stacked in nearly every way, are as unforgiving as they come. And then it flipped. Sean Doolittle came on with two outs and overcame the decibels and Jose Altuve. Houston\u2019s engine, fresh off his ALCS winning walk-off home run, lined to right, leaving the tying run stranded at second. In the ninth, Doolittle struck out Alex Bregman before Yuli Gurriel and Carlos Correa popped out to end the game. Perhaps we should\u2019ve known. These Nats beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, a team that\u2019s supposed to be suiting up in their third consecutive World Series. Then Washington thoroughly embarrassed the St Louis Cardinals, another blue-blooded National League outfit. Now they\u2019ve walked into a loud and hostile room and walked out with a win. Aggressive managing from Dave Martinez helped: the Nats skipper summoned an inning from starter Patrick Corbin in the sixth to protect that lead. It may or may not impact their starting pitching plans for the rest of the Series, but the move worked and sent out a message to anyone still wondering if the Nats thought this Series was just gravy. Now it\u2019s the Astros, who came in as the biggest World Series favorites since 2007, who need to steady their yacht as they face the Nat\u2019s stingy ace, Stephen Strasburg, who\u2019s excelled in his seven postseason games. They\u2019ll throw another ace, Justin Verlander, who is making his 29th postseason start and did get touched up some by the Yankees last round. All shall be revealed shortly as we head into our coverage of Game 2 of the 115th World Series. Until then, please feel free to weet thoughts, feelings and predictions at me @lengeldavid Stick with us, more to come... David will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how Game 1 developed:",

However there is a backstop. If the sector fails to innovate and manage emissions, it could be brought into the ETS as early as 2022.</p> <p>In a joint statement signed by the major industry leaders including DairyNZ, Federated Farmers and Beef and Lamb New Zealand, the sector welcomed the collaborative approach, and said it was \u201cpleased\u201d agriculture would not have its emissions taxed.</p> <p>\u201cAchieving this programme of work will not be cheap, and it will not be easy \u2026 we welcome this pragmatic and sensible decision by the government to work in partnership with industry to achieve tangible on-farm change and hope that it might provide a blueprint for the way we work together to solve environmental challenges in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The five-year action plan will include government incentives for early adopters, improved tools for estimating and benchmarking farm emissions, integrated farm plans that include a climate module, and recognition of on-farm climate mitigation efforts such as small plantings, riparian areas and natural cover.</p> <p>The opposition National party\u2019s spokesman on climate change, Scott Simpson, said the ETS tax was hanging over farmers\u2019 heads if they didn\u2019t adapt quickly enough.</p> <p>Forcing farmers out of business would also raise global emissions, Simpson said, because New Zealand would be forced to import more food.</p> <p>\u201cNational has a clear criteria that would need to be met before we\u2019re comfortable with agriculture entering the ETS or a similar pricing mechanism. There needs to be science-based mitigation options available for farmers that don\u2019t lead to herd culling and decreased food production,\u201d Simpson said.</p> <p>\u201cNew Zealand would have the only farmers in the world to be a part of an ETS. It\u2019s important we are not put at a disadvantage to our international competitors or we risk losing our valuable market share to a less sustainable producer.\u201d</p> <p>As well as government grants totalling more than NZ$200m, industry bodies said they would also commit at least NZ$25m a year to boost emissions-reduction efforts around the country.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand farmers have five years to reduce their carbon emissions before the government introduces financial penalties, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced. Ardern\u2019s Labour coalition government has committed to making New Zealand carbon net-zero by 2050, with the PM likening the climate change battle to the previous generations\u2019 struggle against the rise of nuclear power. If emissions are not adequately reduced, farmers could face additional taxes as early as 2022. There has been long-simmering hostility between the Labour government and farmers, especially in the dairy sector, with many saying the government\u2019s sweeping plans to force them to be more environmentally sustainable are not economically viable and would cause some to walk off their properties. The climate emissions reform plan and cleaning up the waterways has caused stress for many, farmers say. But Ardern says she has listened to farmers and is willing to give them time to reform on a property-by-property basis. \u201cFor too long politicians have passed the buck and caused uncertainty for everyone while the need for climate action was clear,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cThis plan provides the primary sector with certainty and puts us shoulder-to-shoulder on a path to reduce emissions, with ongoing support to help with the plan such as the $229m sustainable land use investment.\u201d \u201cThis will reduce emissions by giving farmers the autonomy to plan to do so, and reward those who do,\u201d she said. In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Ardern said farmers would be included in the emissions trading scheme (ETS) \u2013 a commitment she softened on Thursday, with critics accusing her of caving in to pressure from the powerful industry. The government has said if the primary sector takes enough proactive action to reduce emissions it would not be brought into the ETS. However there is a backstop. If the sector fails to innovate and manage emissions, it could be brought into the ETS as early as 2022. In a joint statement signed by the major industry leaders including DairyNZ, Federated Farmers and Beef and Lamb New Zealand, the sector welcomed the collaborative approach, and said it was \u201cpleased\u201d agriculture would not have its emissions taxed. \u201cAchieving this programme of work will not be cheap, and it will not be easy \u2026 we welcome this pragmatic and sensible decision by the government to work in partnership with industry to achieve tangible on-farm change and hope that it might provide a blueprint for the way we work together to solve environmental challenges in the future.\u201d The five-year action plan will include government incentives for early adopters, improved tools for estimating and benchmarking farm emissions, integrated farm plans that include a climate module, and recognition of on-farm climate mitigation efforts such as small plantings, riparian areas and natural cover. The opposition National party\u2019s spokesman on climate change, Scott Simpson, said the ETS tax was hanging over farmers\u2019 heads if they didn\u2019t adapt quickly enough. Forcing farmers out of business would also raise global emissions, Simpson said, because New Zealand would be forced to import more food. \u201cNational has a clear criteria that would need to be met before we\u2019re comfortable with agriculture entering the ETS or a similar pricing mechanism. There needs to be science-based mitigation options available for farmers that don\u2019t lead to herd culling and decreased food production,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cNew Zealand would have the only farmers in the world to be a part of an ETS. It\u2019s important we are not put at a disadvantage to our international competitors or we risk losing our valuable market share to a less sustainable producer.\u201d As well as government grants totalling more than NZ$200m, industry bodies said they would also commit at least NZ$25m a year to boost emissions-reduction efforts around the country.",

      "bodyText": "A group of snorkelling grandmothers who swim up to 3km five days a week have uncovered a large population of venomous sea snakes in a bay in Noumea where scientists once believed they were rare. Dr Claire Goiran from the University of New Caledonia and Professor Rick Shine from Australia\u2019s Macquarie University were studying a small harmless species known as the turtle\u2010headed sea snake located in the Baie des Citrons, but would occasionally encounter the 1.5 metre-long venomous greater sea snake, also known as the olive-headed sea snake. Goiran and Shine believed the greater sea snake was an anomaly in the popular swimming bay as it had only been spotted about six times over 15 years. From 2013, they decided to take a closer look at the greater sea snake to better understand its importance to the bay\u2019s ecosystem. \u201cThe study zone is in the most touristic bay in Noumea, so I often meet people when I am doing field work on sea snakes,\u201d Goiran said. \u201cWhen I was snorkelling on my own studying sea snakes, I used to meet a friend of mine called Aline that was snorkelling and taking photos on the same reef. In order to help me, she started taking photos of sea snakes and would send them to me by mail. \u201cI was very happy, so she asked her neighbour and friend Monique to help me too. Monique asked another friend, and soon there were seven grandmothers helping me.\u201d The group named themselves \u201cthe fantastic grandmothers\u201d and range in age from 60 to 75. As the grandmothers sent photos through to Goiran and Shine, they realised they had vastly underestimated the population of greater sea snakes. Goiran and Shine have now published a paper in the journal Ecosphere revealing there are more than 250 greater sea snakes in the bay. Greater sea snakes have distinctive markings, allowing individuals to be easily identified from photographs. \u201cEven when I am stuck at university with teaching, I know what is going on in the study zone because the grandmas survey the zone for me and send me the photos,\u201d Goiran said. \u201cRemarkably,\u201d Shine added, \u201cthe grandmothers found a large number of lethally toxic sea snakes in a small bay that is occupied every day by hordes of local residents and cruise\u2010ship passengers \u2013 yet no bites by the species have ever been recorded at Baie des Citrons, testifying to their benevolent disposition.\u201d They said the findings mean the role the snakes play in the functioning of the ecosystem is more important than previously thought. Scientists believe the snakes likely play a role in nutrient cycling through coral reefs, but there is little research available. Would this work have been possible without help from the citizen scientist grandmas? \u201cOf course not,\u201d Goiran said. However it was hard to get all seven in the group going out at the same time, she said, because \u201cthere is always at least one away hiking, biking, sailing, taking yoga class or taking care of the grandkids\u201d. One of the grandmothers, Aline Gu\u00e9mas, said she was not scared of the greater sea snakes despite their potential deadly bite. The grandmothers always keep their distance and never touch them. \u201cThat\u2019s the job of the boss,\u201d Gu\u00e9mas said. Her job was just to take videos and photos. Other members of the group helped with identifying the snakes and documenting their characteristics. The sea snakes could move quickly, making taking photographs difficult at times. But Gu\u00e9mas said \u201cthey are very slow in their movements when they forage for food\u201d, making those times ideal for photography. Her friend in the group, Sylvie Shebert, said she was afraid of the snakes at first but has grown to appreciate them. \u201cIt has been interesting to learn about and discover their lifestyle and to work with the group,\u201d she said. \u201cIt allows us to integrate our swimming with the scientific world by sharing the results of what we find with the researchers, such as the area where the snake is located, it\u2019s condition such as if it is pregnant or not, that kind of thing.\u201d Monique Mazi\u00e8re said \u201cthe snakes are not aggressive, just curious\u201d. \u201cOf course, we will never touch them.\u201d",

Guardian Australia revealed earlier this year that Newstart recipients with partial capacity to work had reached a record high of 200,000 in December 2018 as people increasingly languish on the unemployment payment, now for an average of three years. But new data for June 2019, released on Wednesday, provided different figures, showing 284,900 on Newstart had \u201cpartial capacity to work\u201d in December 2018. The figure for June increased to 289,489, of a total of 686,000 people on Newstart. It means 42% of recipients now have an illness or disability that prevents them from working full-time. In September 2014, the figure was 25% using the new figures. Notes provided in the updated quarterly statistics report confirmed the previous data only included people who had been assessed as having a \u201cpartial capacity to work\u201d within the past two years. This is also stated in the previous reports. But it means sick and disabled people who have been languishing on Newstart for years but had not been reassessed in the past 48 months were excluded from the statistics. The new statistics are significant because welfare groups have long argued changes to the disability support pension would result in a large number of people languishing on Newstart because they were too sick to work. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that 40% of people on Newstart have an illness or disability,\u201d said the Australian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie. \u201cNo one can survive on $40 a day and it\u2019s even tougher if you\u2019re sick or have a disability.

The Department of Social Services\u2019 Nathan Williamson rejected that the previous data contained \u201cerrors\u201d, saying the department had found a \u201cbetter way, a more fulsome way\u201d to report the statistics. People with a partial capacity to work are considered not sick or disabled enough to be granted the disability pension as a result of the tightening of disability support pension eligibility. They are assessed as being able to work more than 15 hours a week but less than 30 hours a week. The Howard government introduced \u201cpartial capacity to work\u201d for people on Newstart in a bid to get more people into work and reduce spending on the more generous disability support pension.

This would also allow access to driver\u2019s licence databases and photographs held by the states and territories. A system for the collation, access, use, sharing and disclosure of this type of data is also outlined in the legislation, sparking concerns about privacy and data security. Four recommendations have been made by the PJCIS committee, chiefly that the regime be rebuilt subject to \u201cparliamentary oversight and reasonable, proportionate and transparent functionality\u201d. It also calls for the regime to be subject to annual reporting, and for the new laws to outline requirements of a participation agreement that sets out the obligations of all parties participating in the identity-matching services in detail. The committee also concurrently examined changes to the Australian Passports Act which would authorise the minister for foreign affairs to disclose personal Australian travel document data for the purpose of participating in the identity-matching services. The committee concluded that the legislation should only be amended to ensure that automated decision making can only be used for favourable or neutral outcomes for the subject, and that such decisions would not negatively affect a person\u2019s legal rights or obligations.",

In court on Thursday, Justice Jayne Jagot ordered Huang \u2013 exiled from Australia after his permanent residency was torn up by the government last year \u2013disclose all of his assets, both in Australia and worldwide, by 11 November. The ATO alleges Huang, a property developer, sought to avoid tax by \u201cgrossly understating\u201d his income for three years, and now owes $140m in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. Huang is contesting the case, and had resisted declaring his worldwide assets, with his lawyers arguing in court the Chinese national had \u201cnot insubstantial\u201d commercial arrangements around the world \u2013 including continuing development projects in Australia \u2013 that could be impacted by him being forced to disclose all of his financial arrangements. Huang\u2019s Yuhu Group is currently developing the site at One Circular Quay in Sydney\u2019s CBD. But work on the project, on the shores of Sydney harbour, has stalled, there is no builder and it is unclear when the project might resume. In court, lawyers for Huang sought \u2013 and received \u2013 assurances that the information disclosed to the court about Huang\u2019s global empire would not be used to mount fresh investigations into his tax affairs or shared with overseas revenue agencies. Huang was exiled from Australia in December last year when the government, on advice from Asio over concerns of foreign political interference, rescinded his permanent residency. His application for citizenship was withdrawn. Huang had been a significant political donor to both the Coalition and Labor parties since arriving in Australia in 2011, but security agencies had consistently raised concerns about his close links to the Chinese Communist Party.

He trains at the gym and values his sleep, and knows he needs regular professional \u201ccheck-ups from the neck up\u201d, he says. \u201cThe difference is I don\u2019t fight [bipolar] anymore. A key part of my recipe is surfing, but you can\u2019t be in the ocean all day, so I need to talk about it, and I need to be surrounded by good people.\u201d Trebilco says people who sense a loved one is struggling with their mental health just need to \u201cbe there, give them a hug, let them talk it out, listen and then ask how you can help. \u2018Can I take you to a doctor?\u2019 is a hard question to ask, but just check in. The biggest thing you can do to start that conversation is be completely honest about how you\u2019re feeling. If you tell someone you\u2019re doing it a bit tough, you\u2019re opening up the doors for your friends and family to say they\u2019re not OK, and then you can help each other out.\u201d The best time to have these conversations is during a normal activity you do together, says Hickie \u2013 eating a meal, walking, surfing, carrying out home repairs \u2013 and \u201cas a normal part of conversation, not a special \u2018we must now sit down and talk about emotional things\u2019.\u201d Hickie advises avoiding phrases such as \u201cI think you should get help\u201d or \u201cyou should see a doctor or a counsellor\u201d. Instead, gently suggest: \u201cLet\u2019s go and get more information.\u201d If it appears necessary to go beyond online sources to seeing a health professional in person, Hickie suggests you say: \u201cWe\u2019ll go together.\u201d \u201cIt is really about building trust first,\u201d says Simkin. \u201cUsually I found [myself] bringing up the conversation during activities: working on bikes, road trips, hikes, a barbecue. Just get out of the everyday box: head to the smash house, do some paintballing. \u201cDon\u2019t go straight to the point. Build it up. I had a few best friends when I came back home [but] most of them have not much clue of the things I have gone through. It is a slow process and it is a matter of just them being there for me.\u201d \u2022 Happy Sad Man is screening in cinemas around Australia in October and November \u2022 In Australia, support is available at BeyondBlue on 1300 22 4636 or www.beyondblue.org.au; at the crisis support service Lifeline at 13 11 14 or www.lifeline.org.au; and at Mensline on 1300 789 978 or www.mensline.org.au.
