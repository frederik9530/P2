      "bodyText": "A couple who say their children are being religiously indoctrinated during Christian school assemblies are to launch a high court challenge. Lee and Lizanne Harris will say in a judicial review claim in the autumn that Burford primary school in Oxfordshire made their children take part in Christian prayers and watch re-enactments of Bible stories including the crucifixion. The couple withdrew their children from the assemblies but say the school refused to provide a meaningful alternative of equal educational worth. Instead, the Harris children were put in a room with an iPad and supervised by a teaching assistant, according to their parents. At the time the Harris children enrolled, Burford primary school was a community school with no religious character. But in 2015 it became an academy and joined the Church of England\u2019s Oxford Diocesan Schools Trust (ODST). All state schools are required to provide an act of daily worship of a \u201cbroadly Christian character\u201d under the 1944 Education Act. Parents are entitled to withdraw their children from collective worship. The Harrises, whose case will be heard at the high court in November, will argue that the school must provide an inclusive assembly as a meaningful alternative for pupils withdrawn from Christian worship. They will raise concerns that during school assemblies, stories of God and Christianity were presented to children as fact, and that school leavers were presented with a Bible as a \u201cguide to life\u201d at a ceremony in a church. The couple also claim that it is inappropriate that officials from a nearby church, St John the Baptist, which is part of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, regularly led worship at school assemblies. In a statement, they said: \u201cWe enrolled our children into a state community school \u2013 which is meant to have no religious character \u2013 but over time we noticed harmful aspects of evangelism spreading into assembly and other parts of the school which goes against our children\u2019s rights to receive an education free from religious interference. \u2018When our children go to school they shouldn\u2019t have to participate in Christian prayers, or watch biblical scenes such as the crucifixion being acted out, nor should they have to hear from evangelical preachers who spout harmful and often divisive messages.\u201d They were going to court reluctantly, they added, \u201cbut [we] feel strongly that we need to try to make our children\u2019s education as inclusive as possible. \u201cWe also don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable that they be left to play with an iPad because we\u2019ve withdrawn them. They should be able to participate in an inclusive assembly that is of equal educational worth and which is welcoming and respectful of all students no matter their background.\u201d The school\u2019s website says daily assemblies provide space for children \u201cto develop a reflective approach to life, and the ability to express their thoughts. Additionally, it is a time when children and staff come together to celebrate shared beliefs and values relating to the day to day life of school.\u201d Once a week, it says, assemblies are organised by the children\u2019s coordinator at St John the Baptist church at which \u201cBible stories are read and brought to life through interactive drama using mime, costume, props, puppets and sound effects, with the children also getting involved\u201d. The website of the ODST, whose 33 church and community schools educate more than 6,100 children, says the trust is \u201cmotivated by our Christian values to serve our local communities, but we do not impose those values \u2026 We welcome those of all faiths and none, and we are proud of the ethnic diversity within our academies which reflects that of their local community.\u201d In a statement, the trust said: \u201cCollective worship, which is a statutory requirement in all church and community schools, is aimed at encouraging pupils to develop a sense of mystery, awe and wonder about the world.

I think we\u2019re on a 10-to-15 year cycle, which would mirror what has happened in Canada.\u201d",

Earlier this year, he introduced a package of bills aimed at lowering prices.

It would also enable US consumers to import pills from Canada and other industrialized countries and it would set drug prices based on what they cost in those other places.</p> <p>\u201cThis resonates in Canada as well,\u201d said Nada Temerinski, 29, who had come from Montreal.</p> <p>Unlike Sanders\u2019 vision for the US, Canada has a private heath insurance since its system does not cover the cost of all benefits, such as prescription drugs. Instead, a review board negotiates prices in part based on rates in other countries.</p> <p>\u201cI would hope that it inspires Canadian politicians,\u201d Temerinski said of Sanders\u2019 work. \u201cI\u2019m hoping as America moves further left, that Canada does as well and ideally we could move towards prescription-free.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/28/baltimore-sun-cnn-trump-cummings-racist-attack\">Democrats and media condemn Trump\u2019s racist Cummings attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rachael Lockwood, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was sharing insulin prescribed for one child with type 1 diabetes between two when another son was diagnosed.</p> <p>\u201cWe were desperate,\u201d she said.

Sanders\u2019 northern sojourn, a trip his campaign sponsored, was designed to highlight the rising cost of prescription drugs in the US, which the senator said was the result of \u201cincredible corruption and greed\u201d on the part of the US pharmaceutical industry. \u201cHow does it happen 10 minutes away from the American border in Michigan, people here are paying one-10th of the price for the vitally important drug they need to stay alive?\u201d Sanders asked, calling the disparity a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d. In his remarks outside of the Olde Walkerville Pharmacy in Windsor, Sanders vowed that as president he would appoint an attorney general to investigate the pharmaceutical industry for what he described as \u201ccollusion\u201d between the major drug companies. \u201cPrices go up and up and up at the same level for the same companies,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what you do is you throw these people in jail if they engage in price-fixing.\u201d The trip came just two days before the second Democratic debate in Detroit. Among 20 candidates over two nights, healthcare is expected to be a major flashpoint. Sanders has exchanged barbs with former Vice-President Joe Biden, who has called the senator\u2019s healthcare policies \u201crisky\u201d. Sanders has accused Biden, whose healthcare plan would build on the Affordable Care Act, of not being honest about Medicare for all. Sanders\u2019 signature proposal, which would give the US something similar to Canada\u2019s national healthcare system, has framed the party debate. Several leading candidates support some version of it. The bus took about an hour to drive six miles across the Detroit river to Windsor, Ontario. Sanders listened as people told their stories. Quinn Nystrom, a type 1 diabetic who organizes caravans out of Minnesota, said she knew people who had lost limbs, been hospitalized or even died as a result of rationing medicine. \u201cInsulin is our oxygen,\u201d she said, stressing that caravan trips are not a sustainable solution to the problem, especially because many cannot afford to take a day off of work or find the fee to apply for a passport. \u201cWhat [the pharmaceutical companies] are doing to Americans is price-gouging us and they\u2019re holding us hostage and people are dying,\u201d she said. When the bus arrived at the pharmacy, around 100 Canadians greeted the passengers. Some held signs that said \u201cInsulin is a human right\u201d. A little girl held a Sanders plush toy with a button on the back that said: \u201cPush to activate the revolution.\u201d An elderly man played accordion while trying to finagle a moment with the senator. In Canada, insulin does not require a prescription. When the American group finished their purchases, Sanders drew gasps from the Canadian crowd. Citing a Yale study, he told them that one in four American diabetics ration their insulin because of cost. That prince for one vial has risen astronomically in two decades, he said, as pharmaceutical companies have spent \u201chundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions\u201d and \u201cbillions of dollars lobbying Congress\u201d. \u201cShame!\u201d someone shouted. Another yelled: \u201cDisgrace!\u201d \u201cThey buy and sell politicians, Republicans and Democrats,\u201d the senator said, \u201cto make sure that they can continue to charge the American people any price they want. This is not just insulin, it is prescription drug after prescription drug.\u201d Kathy and Hunter Sego paid $1,000 for 25 vials of insulin, enough for about six months. They estimated it would have cost $10,000 more for the same supply back home. Speaking to the crowd at the pharmacy, she described the hardship of choosing to pay the electricity bill or for son\u2019s medicine. On at least two occasion\u2019s their power has been turned off. \u201cHow can that be that in the United States of America that I am paying so much for insulin?\u201d she asked, fighting back tears. Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan would cap the out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at $200 per year. Earlier this year, he introduced a package of bills aimed at lowering prices. The legislation would allow the government to directly negotiate with drug manufacturers, to obtain lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. It would also enable US consumers to import pills from Canada and other industrialized countries and it would set drug prices based on what they cost in those other places. \u201cThis resonates in Canada as well,\u201d said Nada Temerinski, 29, who had come from Montreal. Unlike Sanders\u2019 vision for the US, Canada has a private heath insurance since its system does not cover the cost of all benefits, such as prescription drugs. Instead, a review board negotiates prices in part based on rates in other countries. \u201cI would hope that it inspires Canadian politicians,\u201d Temerinski said of Sanders\u2019 work. \u201cI\u2019m hoping as America moves further left, that Canada does as well and ideally we could move towards prescription-free.\u201d Rachael Lockwood, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was sharing insulin prescribed for one child with type 1 diabetes between two when another son was diagnosed. \u201cWe were desperate,\u201d she said. On Sunday, she and her three children aged seven, 12, and 16, made their second trip to Canada for the insulin. In 2016, she voted for Donald Trump in hopes that a businessman might be able to fix the nation\u2019s problems. But now that she is a \u201cmedical refugee,\u201d as one member of the caravan described them, forced to travel abroad for affordable medicine, her perspective has changed. Trump, she said, will not be her choice in 2020. This was not Sanders\u2019 first trip to Canada for prescription drugs. He said he had made a similar trip from Vermont to Montreal, with women with breast cancer. \u201cIt never ends,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThe greed of the pharmaceutical industry \u2013 the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry \u2013 is scandalous and we have got to take them on.\u201d",

That mentality isn\u2019t a cut and paste. \u201cWe are going to have to really think about Xabi [Artetxe] coaching and supporting him for him to get the best out of Egan and the guys. That\u2019s why I went to Colombia in January. I thought, \u2018Can we produce the culture that\u2019s going to get the best out of them?\u2019 rather than expecting them to adapt to our culture which is different.\u201d While Thomas acknowledged that he and Froome, both approaching their mid\u2011thirties, now faced competition from Brailsford\u2019s collection of prodigious young talents, he was dismissive of those who are suggesting he is past his best. \u201cI don\u2019t read it, although certain stuff filters through to me and spurs me on\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a lot closer to the end than the start: me and Egan are on separate spectrums but it\u2019s great to be having this success.\u201d Second overall, after a battle for fitness, crashes and a lack of hard racing, was a significant result for Thomas. However intense his disappointment, he hid it well as, 12 months after his own success, Bernal was feted in Paris. \u201cI can be proud and satisfied I\u2019ve done everything I could to try and be in the best shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were a lot of doubters. It\u2019s always nice to show what I can do and back it up. If someone else had won, it would be really disappointing, but Egan\u2019s won and it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Brailsford praised Thomas\u2019s resilience despite the setbacks in his title defence. \u201cGeraint\u2019s ridden really well here, considering that a lot wrote him off after the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole theory that he can\u2019t win after the first time \u2014 he deserves a lot of credit for getting himself in the shape he did. Having missed the racing he was supposed to have, he\u2019s done terrifically well. \u201cHe was very close to winning this. He just had that little block in the middle where he could have stepped up and he could have been right up there.\u201d",

affected\u201d.</p> \n<p>It said that legislation to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland with immediate effect would be needed to get through a no-deal Brexit if the devolved government is not restored by the end of October.</p> \n<p>\u201cJohnson may well find that having left one political union, he spends an increasing proportion of his time trying to keep another together,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>The IfG, which has offices next to the Foreign Office near St James\u2019s Park, has regular access to lawmakers and top officials enabling it to give frank assessments on all aspects of government.</p> \n<p>Its publication comes just days after Johnson unveiled plans for a <a

fuelling speculation that Johnson is preparing for one even though he is publicly ruling it out before Brexit happens.</p> \n<p>However, the report outlines just how uncertain the future would be for Boris Johnson after a crashout, suggesting everything other than Brexit would be overshadowed.</p> \n<p>In another sign of the uncertainty Johnson faces, the owner of Vauxhall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/29/brexit-could-spell-end-of-ellesmere-port-plant-says-vauxhall-owner\">warned on Sunday</a> that it will close its Ellesmere Port plant with the loss of 1,000 jobs if Brexit renders it unprofitable.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo deal is a step into the unknown: the prime minister\u2019s second 100 days will be even more unpredictable than his first,\u201d the report says, adding that the EU is unlikely to agree to negotiate any \u201cside deals\u201d to soften the impact.</p> \n<p>\u201cRather than \u2018turbo-charging\u2019 the economy, as Johnson has suggested, the government is more likely to be occupied with providing money and support to businesses and industries that have not prepared or are worst affected by a no-deal Brexit \u2013 as well as dealing with UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens here, who have been similarly caught out,\u201d it says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\"

documents but warns that \u201cas the name suggests these are just assumptions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Nobody can predict how the country, businesses and ordinary voters will react to no deal, something the IfG has been saying for some time, say the authors, Joe Owen, Maddy Thimont Jack and Jill Rutter.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe risk registers that exist across Whitehall for a no-deal Brexit may have detailed plans for how to manage anticipated risks.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut some of the biggest potential headaches will come from those issues that have not been foreseen,\u201d the reports concludes.</p> \n<p>With Labour, the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats and up to 40 backbench Tories all pledging to fight a no-deal Brexit, Johnson has begun a campaign to try to convince the public and MPs that his government will be ready if necessary.</p> \n<p>No 10 revealed that Johnson has tasked a series of new cabinet committees with preparing for no deal, with overall responsibility going to Michael Gove, effectively now a minister without portfolio.</p> \n<p>The prime minister spoke to his cabinet at lunchtime on Sunday to outline a new \u201cdaily operations committee\u201d codenamed

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s ambitious domestic agenda would be crushed by the pressing needs of the emergency that would follow a no-deal Brexit, a new report by a Whitehall thinktank has concluded. The Institute for Government (IfG) warned there is \u201cno such thing as a managed no deal\u201d and the hard Brexiters predictions of a \u201cclean break\u201d from the EU will not materialise. Johnson will begin his first full week in Downing Street by ramping up planning for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, with more than \u00a31bn to be announced within days for preparations by Sajid Javid, the chancellor. He sent out a raft of cabinet ministers over the weekend to talk about \u201cturbo-charging\u201d preparations as part of a publicity blitz, making clear that the UK will be heading for no deal unless EU leaders agree to replace the Irish backstop. The new prime minister is also heading to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the coming days to promise to \u201cstrengthen the union\u201d, but he faces a difficult meeting with Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, on Monday as she warned over the weekend that she cannot sign up to his no-deal Brexit strategy. In its report on no deal, the IfG predicted that the union of the United Kingdom would come under \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with Northern Ireland \u201cmost acutely affected\u201d. It said that legislation to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland with immediate effect would be needed to get through a no-deal Brexit if the devolved government is not restored by the end of October. \u201cJohnson may well find that having left one political union, he spends an increasing proportion of his time trying to keep another together,\u201d it said. The IfG, which has offices next to the Foreign Office near St James\u2019s Park, has regular access to lawmakers and top officials enabling it to give frank assessments on all aspects of government. Its publication comes just days after Johnson unveiled plans for a high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds, 20,000 new police officers and extra money for social care and schools. The pledges appear designed to appeal to the public in an election, fuelling speculation that Johnson is preparing for one even though he is publicly ruling it out before Brexit happens. However, the report outlines just how uncertain the future would be for Boris Johnson after a crashout, suggesting everything other than Brexit would be overshadowed. In another sign of the uncertainty Johnson faces, the owner of Vauxhall warned on Sunday that it will close its Ellesmere Port plant with the loss of 1,000 jobs if Brexit renders it unprofitable. \u201cNo deal is a step into the unknown: the prime minister\u2019s second 100 days will be even more unpredictable than his first,\u201d the report says, adding that the EU is unlikely to agree to negotiate any \u201cside deals\u201d to soften the impact. \u201cRather than \u2018turbo-charging\u2019 the economy, as Johnson has suggested, the government is more likely to be occupied with providing money and support to businesses and industries that have not prepared or are worst affected by a no-deal Brexit \u2013 as well as dealing with UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens here, who have been similarly caught out,\u201d it says. The authors reveal that the government\u2019s planning assumptions are \u201clocked away on secret computers known as Rosa terminals\u201d across Whitehall in classified documents but warns that \u201cas the name suggests these are just assumptions\u201d. Nobody can predict how the country, businesses and ordinary voters will react to no deal, something the IfG has been saying for some time, say the authors, Joe Owen, Maddy Thimont Jack and Jill Rutter. \u201cThe risk registers that exist across Whitehall for a no-deal Brexit may have detailed plans for how to manage anticipated risks. \u201cBut some of the biggest potential headaches will come from those issues that have not been foreseen,\u201d the reports concludes. With Labour, the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats and up to 40 backbench Tories all pledging to fight a no-deal Brexit, Johnson has begun a campaign to try to convince the public and MPs that his government will be ready if necessary. No 10 revealed that Johnson has tasked a series of new cabinet committees with preparing for no deal, with overall responsibility going to Michael Gove, effectively now a minister without portfolio. The prime minister spoke to his cabinet at lunchtime on Sunday to outline a new \u201cdaily operations committee\u201d codenamed XO. It will be chaired by Gove and meet in the Cobra emergency situation room, with live actions, deadlines and lines of accountability on screens at every meeting. Others involved include an all-male lineup of Javid; the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab; the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay; and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general. There will be two other Brexit committees chaired by the prime minister \u2013 an exit economy and trade committee \u2013 meeting regularly, and an exit strategy committee meeting twice weekly. Dominic Cummings, the mastermind behind Vote Leave, who has been hired as Johnson\u2019s special adviser, has been tasked with delivering Brexit \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. In a meeting with fellow special advisers, he made it clear that he believes No 10 can outmanoeuvre parliamentary critics of no deal and force Brexit to happen by 31 October. However, leading former cabinet ministers \u2013 Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart \u2013 are all preparing to join the cross-party battle to make sure parliament has a say on the form of the UK\u2019s departure. One source close to the group said Cummings\u2019s confidence of being able to proceed with a no deal if necessary was \u201cmisplaced\u201d, while another former cabinet minister described the senior No 10 adviser as a \u201cmaster of disinformation and spin\u201d. The IfG report warned that Johnson\u2019s emergency efforts, now led by Cummings and Gove, will drain the capacity of Whitehall and government and crowd out his ambitions for domestic reforms. It pointed out that Theresa May said her priority was stamping out \u201cburning injustices\u201d when she assumed power and Johnson\u2019s ambitions could similarly be stymied. \u201cDeal or no deal prime ministers need time, capacity and political capital to spend on their priorities,\u201d the authors say, warning how a Brexit crisis could swamp efforts. \u201cBrexit is likely to preoccupy the work of the civil service for years to come. There will be at least 16,000 officials working on it by the autumn, and that number could still increase,\u201d it says. \u201cDelivering a no-deal Brexit would leave the prime minister with little space for an ambitious domestic agenda. \u201cWhitehall would be working flat out on Brexit for months, with many areas of work extending for years,\u201d the report adds. No matter how keen Johnson and his new team are to institute a new domestic agenda, \u201cmajor showdowns in parliament would continue, on the budget or Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 both due shortly after 31 October\u201d, says the report. \u201cThe difficult choices that have been unresolved for the last three years will not evaporate overnight on 31 October. And Brexit will remain the key dividing line in a parliament in which Johnson\u2019s government has a wafer-thin majority, and one that is constantly under threat,\u201d it concludes. In the coming weeks, it says the whole of government must shift to no-deal planning with thousands of civil servants moved to operational no-deal centres immediately. The report also suggests an emergency Brexit budget may be needed in the autumn, something the new chancellor is said to be looking at already. A second report by the Confederation of British Industry out on Monday will say neither the UK nor the EU are ready for no deal.",

In her regular column for the Scottish Mail on Sunday, Davidson wrote: \u201cWhen I was debating against the pro-Brexit side in 2016, I don\u2019t remember anybody saying we should crash out of the EU with no arrangements in place to help maintain the vital trade that flows uninterrupted between Britain and the European Union. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government should pursue a no-deal Brexit and, if it comes to it, I won\u2019t support it.\u201d Saying she had confirmed her position to Johnson when the pair spoke by telephone last week after his election as UK Conservative leader, Davidson added: \u201cAs leader of the party in Scotland, my position exists independently of government. I don\u2019t have to sign a no-deal pledge to continue to serve.\u201d The Scottish government also poured scorn on Johnson\u2019s announcement of \u00a3300m for growth deals, saying that with a no-deal Brexit on the table it was \u201cfiddling while Rome burns\u201d. A spokesperson for Derek MacKay, the Scottish finance secretary, said: \u201cInvestment in Scotland is always welcome but on top of delivering on this existing commitment the new prime minister must honour his new found belief in the Barnett formula by transferring a full share of the \u00a33.6bn announced for towns in England to the Scottish government, further funding for no-deal planning as well as the \u00a3160m of farming funding that has been withheld, a fair share of the funds given to the DUP to prop up the UK government and the outstanding \u00a3175m of police and fire VAT charges that have yet to be returned. \u201cIf Mr Johnson thinks he can win over Scotland with recycled and underfunded spending plans he has a lot to learn in his new role.\u201d The announcement of \u00a3300m in cash for development projects comes on top of an existing \u00a32.78bn committed for growth deals across the devolved nations. During his visit to Scotland, Johnson is expected to say: \u201cOur union is the most successful political and economic union in history. We are a global brand and together we are safer, stronger and more prosperous. \u201cSo as we prepare for our bright future after Brexit, it\u2019s vital we renew the ties that bind our United Kingdom. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be in Scotland today to make clear that I am a passionate believer in our great union, and I look forward to visiting Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure that every decision I make as prime minister promotes and strengthens our union.\u201d Johnson has made visiting Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a priority amid warnings from some Tory colleagues that a no-deal Brexit could increase support for independence. He has infuriated Davidson by sacking her ally, David Mundell, as Scottish secretary, and replacing him with another Scottish Tory MP, Alister Jack, plus an English MP, Robin Walker, as a junior minister. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is reviewing the timetable for a possible second vote on Scottish independence and Johnson has been branded the \u201clast prime minister of the UK\u201d by the SNP. Both Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, have told the prime minister it would be \u201cunconscionable\u201d for the UK to leave the EU without a deal. Johnson told the first meeting of his cabinet on Thursday that he would be taking the title of minister for the union alongside that of prime minister \u2013 a move described by a spokesman as a statement of his commitment to strengthening the union.",

      "body": "<p>Cindy Sherman does not want to appear on camera. \u201cWhy not?\u201d asks the director, Clare Beavan. \u201cPeople,\u201d says Sherman, \u201care just so curious to see what I really look like. So there is this intrigue.\u201d Can you make a film about someone without seeing their face as they talk about their life and work? I\u2019m one of those desperate to see Sherman, to reconcile the person with the roles she creates for her art, but perhaps I\u2019m just prying. In the Arena documentary Cindy Sherman #untitled (BBC Four), we get her voice in a new interview, and Beavan has filleted previous filmed interviews, the last from 2009. Peel away the layers in her portraits and you can see the traces of Sherman\u2019s eyebrows and the wrinkles in her skin. \u201cYou can see the cracks in the armour,\u201d says her old photography teacher. She\u2019s in there somewhere, despite her best efforts to vanish.</p> <p>This film is a great look at one of the most important artists working today, told through the interviews with Sherman and through insightful offerings from those who have known and worked with her. I could have done without the inclusion of a group of Instagram influencers \u2013 used to make the point about how relevant Sherman\u2019s work is in our selfie-obsessed, digitally artificial world \u2013 and had more from Sherman on the big issues: love, death, ageing and parrot-keeping. Her parrot, Mister Frieda, is the only being allowed in the studio with Sherman while she works \u2013 it\u2019s a pity he only says \u201chello\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/30/cindy-sherman-national-portrait-gallery-review-a-lifetime-of-making-herself-up\">Cindy Sherman review \u2013 a lifetime of making herself up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I love Sherman\u2019s filing cabinets of props \u2013 fake eyeballs in one drawer, teeth in another, noses in another. People say she is really trying to do self-portraits or reveal a hidden side to her, but that\u2019s not right, says Sherman: \u201cIt\u2019s more that I\u2019m trying to lose myself, to really totally disappear.\u201d In footage from previous interviews, Sherman reveals more of her working practice \u2013 she has a mirror next to the camera and concentrates on \u201ctrying to transform that reflection that I see into this other person\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Cindy Sherman does not want to appear on camera. \u201cWhy not?\u201d asks the director, Clare Beavan. \u201cPeople,\u201d says Sherman, \u201care just so curious to see what I really look like. So there is this intrigue.\u201d Can you make a film about someone without seeing their face as they talk about their life and work? I\u2019m one of those desperate to see Sherman, to reconcile the person with the roles she creates for her art, but perhaps I\u2019m just prying. In the Arena documentary Cindy Sherman #untitled (BBC Four), we get her voice in a new interview, and Beavan has filleted previous filmed interviews, the last from 2009. Peel away the layers in her portraits and you can see the traces of Sherman\u2019s eyebrows and the wrinkles in her skin. \u201cYou can see the cracks in the armour,\u201d says her old photography teacher. She\u2019s in there somewhere, despite her best efforts to vanish. This film is a great look at one of the most important artists working today, told through the interviews with Sherman and through insightful offerings from those who have known and worked with her. I could have done without the inclusion of a group of Instagram influencers \u2013 used to make the point about how relevant Sherman\u2019s work is in our selfie-obsessed, digitally artificial world \u2013 and had more from Sherman on the big issues: love, death, ageing and parrot-keeping. Her parrot, Mister Frieda, is the only being allowed in the studio with Sherman while she works \u2013 it\u2019s a pity he only says \u201chello\u201d. I love Sherman\u2019s filing cabinets of props \u2013 fake eyeballs in one drawer, teeth in another, noses in another. People say she is really trying to do self-portraits or reveal a hidden side to her, but that\u2019s not right, says Sherman: \u201cIt\u2019s more that I\u2019m trying to lose myself, to really totally disappear.\u201d In footage from previous interviews, Sherman reveals more of her working practice \u2013 she has a mirror next to the camera and concentrates on \u201ctrying to transform that reflection that I see into this other person\u201d. She edits out the pictures where she recognises herself until \u201cfinally, I see the one that looks like somebody else\u201d. These somebody elses are a huge cast of characters, from clowns and Renaissance Madonnas and pig-nosed horrors to Hitchcockian heroines and pink-cheeked teenagers and ageing society dames.

The Clean Energy Regulator, which released the report, says this makes Australia the global leader in per capita renewable energy deployment.

He cites a 2018 study that tracked participants\u2019 activity levels and personality traits over 20 years, and found that those who moved the least showed malign personality changes, scoring lower in the positive traits: openness, extraversion and agreeableness. There is substantial data showing that walkers have lower rates of depression, too. And O\u2019Mara says the scientific literature tells us \u201cthat getting people to engage in physical activity before they engage in a creative act is very powerful\u201d.</p> <h2>Media roundup</h2> <p>The <strong>Sydney Morning Herald</strong> reports that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/xi-jinping-s-cousin-a-high-roller-as-crown-comes-under-pressure-over-crime-influence-20190726-p52b2s.html\">a cousin of Chinese president Xi Jinping</a> was on board a private jet for high-roller gamblers that was searched by police on the Gold Coast in 2016 as part of an international money-laundering investigation.

Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony to Congress potentially cleared the path to impeachment, House judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler said on Sunday, defending the decision to call the former special counsel before Congress. Hong Kong police fired teargas and rubber bullets at protesters on Sunday, as political unrest deepened. Tens of thousands of people defied police orders to keep the rally constrained to a park in central Hong Kong. Dozens of gold miners have invaded a remote indigenous reserve in the Brazilian Amazon where a local leader was stabbed to death, taking over a village after the community fled in fear, local politicians and indigenous leaders have said. A woman from Belarus has died after being swept away by a river in Alaska while trying to reach an abandoned bus made famous by the book and film Into the Wild. Opinion and analysis New data released quietly late last week underscores the staggering pace of growth of renewable energy across Australia. Nearly 3.5 gigawatts of large-scale clean energy projects were built in 2018. In generation terms, the amount of clean electricity being sent into Australian homes and businesses is expected to increase 36% this year, and should grow another 25% next year. The Clean Energy Regulator, which released the report, says this makes Australia the global leader in per capita renewable energy deployment. And in an outcome considered near impossible four years ago, the country already has enough projects committed to meet the national 2020 renewable energy target, roughly equivalent to about 23% of electricity required. The link between the Old Etonian Boris Johnson and punk rock may not be immediately obvious, writes John Harris, but the Brexit instinct is at least partly about outrage for outrage\u2019s sake. \u201cLed by a serial smasher-upper and self-publicist, we are on our way out of the EU because of a collective set of desires akin to the punk-era urge to break things, along with a connected inability to channel resentment into anything more than gestures of self-harm \u2026 This is an increasingly familiar populist trick: encouraging a set of voters to relish taboo-busting as a kind of surrogate for a lost sense of economic agency and power.\u201d Sport Egan Bernal has become the first Colombian to win the Tour de France. The 22-year-old was mobbed by teammates and delirious Colombian fans who had flooded Paris to celebrate a long-awaited success in the world\u2019s most famous cycle race. Collingwood and Adelaide are struggling with the burden of expectation in the AFL finals race, writes Craig Little, while Richmond and Brisbane are relishing the pressure. Thinking time: How walking makes us healthier, happier and brainier Neurologist Shane O\u2019Mara\u2019s book In Praise of Walking is a backstage tour of what happens in our brains while we perambulate. O\u2019Mara, 53, is in his element striding through urban landscapes \u2013 from epic hikes across London\u2019s sprawl to more sedate ambles in Oxford, where he received his DPhil \u2013 and waxing lyrical about science, nature, architecture and literature. He favours what he calls a \u201cmotor-centric\u201d view of the brain \u2013 that it evolved to support movement and, therefore, if we stop moving about, it won\u2019t work as well. \u201cOur sensory systems work at their best when they\u2019re moving about the world,\u201d says O\u2019Mara. He cites a 2018 study that tracked participants\u2019 activity levels and personality traits over 20 years, and found that those who moved the least showed malign personality changes, scoring lower in the positive traits: openness, extraversion and agreeableness. There is substantial data showing that walkers have lower rates of depression, too. And O\u2019Mara says the scientific literature tells us \u201cthat getting people to engage in physical activity before they engage in a creative act is very powerful\u201d. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a cousin of Chinese president Xi Jinping was on board a private jet for high-roller gamblers that was searched by police on the Gold Coast in 2016 as part of an international money-laundering investigation. The ABC says the US military has allocated more than a quarter of a billion dollars on naval construction in the Northern Territory, \u201cin a move that could raise tensions with China\u201d. And the Australian reports that Australia will lead an international online campaign to target child exploitation. Coming up The New South Wales coroner will hand down findings in the death of pregnant Aboriginal woman Naomi Williams, who presented around 50 times to medical service providers in the year before she died in Tumut hospital. The defamation case brought by former Labor MP Emma Husar against BuzzFeed is back in court in Sydney.

Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series.</em></p> \n<p>Last week was a low point for June\u2019s morals, but here she found new depths, driving a pregnant woman to suicide-by-cop. None of June\u2019s spiteful actions will bring Gilead down, or even hurt its founders, but that\u2019s not her goal right now. She\u2019s hellbent on getting revenge on Ofmatthew, the informer she blames for the death of Hannah\u2019s beloved Martha Frances.</p> \n<p>Serena\u2019s betrayal, Hannah\u2019s loss and the many cruel home-truths of Commander Lawrence seem to have made June crack. The malicious bully we see here has nothing in common with the woman who chose five women to save from death for the resistance a few episodes ago, or the one who threw herself on top of Janine to shield her from a beating. Not even mouthing off to Lawrence can give her the satisfaction or punishment she craves. \u201cNo one\u2019s empty of sin,\u201d she tells Aunt Lydia during her \u2018testifying\u2019, but June is empty of everything else. She feels no fear when Ofmatthew snaps and points a gun at her, no sadness as she curiously examines a dead baby, and she is doing all she can to avoid feeling guilt for her role in Frances\u2019 execution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6833e75c7c6cd3b3ca97209e624b7de4d9cc991\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6833e75c7c6cd3b3ca97209e624b7de4d9cc991/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serving up cruel home-truths ...

The handmaids are all in the same boat, and have always shown compassion to one another. Them suddenly turning on Ofmatthew seems to be an excuse to push her storyline to a speedier conclusion, ending in the depressingly inevitable Loaves and Fishes bloodbath. June muses that now she knows how Emily felt before she ran over an Eye, to reach that point of self-destruction. But as Ofmatthew\u2019s lifeless body is hauled out, June has triumph in her eyes. Maybe she\u2019s gloating over the destruction of an enemy, or maybe she\u2019s satisfied to learn that, unlike Ofmatthew, Emily, or Ofglen, she isn\u2019t going to snap.</p> \n<h2><strong>Aunt Lydia</strong></h2> \n<p>Praise be \u2013 an Aunt Lydia flashback! Three seasons in and we finally come closer to understanding the Aunt Formally Known As Lydia Clemmons, in what was easily this episode\u2019s highlight. We meet her in an undisclosed period of time pre-Gilead, where she\u2019s a caring teacher with free-flowing hair and chilli, who transitioned out of family law because she just wasn\u2019t able to help enough children. This is a woman who, like the Aunt Lydia we know and are deeply unsettled by, is convinced of her own ability to do (and define) good.</p> \n<p>The flashback sees Lydia getting close to a single-parent family she is trying to help, as well as to a colleague, Jim. She\u2019s clearly a well-meaning and lonely person, recovering from a marriage that \u201cwas a mistake\u201d, but the hints of the Lydia who will find her calling in Gilead are there from the start, as she refers to children as a \u2018blessing\u2019, and twitches with disapproval when single mother Noelle asks if she has a girlfriend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3521995044d248377fcf1b56e1ac9806a7ded2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3521995044d248377fcf1b56e1ac9806a7ded2/0_91_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We have witnessed, essentially, the birth of Aunt Lydia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We have witnessed the birth of Aunt Lydia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Savage/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She craves physical contact, and a scene in which Noelle applies makeup to her face becomes almost sensual. Later, Lydia is filled with self-disgust after letting her passions run away with her at the end of an otherwise lovely first date with Jim. He\u2019s still keen on a second date, but Lydia has some issues regarding her own sexuality, and is repulsed by herself afterwards, promptly pulling her hair back into its familiar style, and declaring that she has a duty to \u201creport moral weakness\u201d as she arranges for Noelle\u2019s son to be taken into care. We have witnessed, essentially, the birth of Aunt Lydia. What we still don\u2019t know is where the fear of her own sexuality comes from. Lydia remains a fascinating enigma, and it\u2019s a joy to see the ever-brilliant Ann Dowd get more material. Lydia, like most characters this season, has been inconsistent in her motivations, but Dowd is never less than magnificent.</p> \n<h2><strong>The sound of music</strong></h2> \n<p>If you\u2019d felt that what this series was missing is Aunt Lydia belting out Dolly Parton, oh boy was this the episode for you, as she and Jim sing Islands in the Stream at a New Year\u2019s Eve karaoke session.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, after that gruesome final scene, we were treated to a cheery blast of Doris Day\u2019s Que Sera Sera \u2013 and what better anthem for June, who is increasingly losing sight of the big picture and giving way to hopelessness?</p> \n<h2><strong>Under his eye</strong></h2> \n<p>The baby Nicole drama has been moved to the backburner, as per Fred and Commander Winslow\u2019s plan. June is still on call for TV appearances, which gives her temporary immunity from the wrath of the Aunts \u2013 and explains how she gets away with most of her behaviour here.<br><br>Seeing how the Aunts pair up handmaids with Commanders \u2013 over glasses of port \u2013 is an interesting insight into how, in their minds at least, they have the handmaids\u2019 best interests at heart.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s an acquired taste, seeing others in pain,\u201d June muses in voiceover. Like a smoky whisky, apparently. Removing people\u2019s compassion for those less fortunate than themselves is a key component of all controlling regimes. Is Gilead finally conquering June?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"42ad171a-5e4c-40ca-bc10-8d3dbf7eaea2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div

Last week was a low point for June\u2019s morals, but here she found new depths, driving a pregnant woman to suicide-by-cop.

Aunt Lydia Praise be \u2013 an Aunt Lydia flashback! Three seasons in and we finally come closer to understanding the Aunt Formally Known As Lydia Clemmons, in what was easily this episode\u2019s highlight. We meet her in an undisclosed period of time pre-Gilead, where she\u2019s a caring teacher with free-flowing hair and chilli, who transitioned out of family law because she just wasn\u2019t able to help enough children.

Lydia remains a fascinating enigma, and it\u2019s a joy to see the ever-brilliant Ann Dowd get more material. Lydia, like most characters this season, has been inconsistent in her motivations, but Dowd is never less than magnificent. The sound of music If you\u2019d felt that what this series was missing is Aunt Lydia belting out Dolly Parton, oh boy was this the episode for you, as she and Jim sing Islands in the Stream at a New Year\u2019s Eve karaoke session. Elsewhere, after that gruesome final scene, we were treated to a cheery blast of Doris Day\u2019s Que Sera Sera \u2013 and what better anthem for June, who is increasingly losing sight of the big picture and giving way to hopelessness? Under his eye The baby Nicole drama has been moved to the backburner, as per Fred and Commander Winslow\u2019s plan. June is still on call for TV appearances, which gives her temporary immunity from the wrath of the Aunts \u2013 and explains how she gets away with most of her behaviour here. Seeing how the Aunts pair up handmaids with Commanders \u2013 over glasses of port \u2013 is an interesting insight into how, in their minds at least, they have the handmaids\u2019 best interests at heart. \u201cIt\u2019s an acquired taste, seeing others in pain,\u201d June muses in voiceover. Like a smoky whisky, apparently. Removing people\u2019s compassion for those less fortunate than themselves is a key component of all controlling regimes. Is Gilead finally conquering June?",

London is not the only place with strange ways, or at least where a great deal of things happen in unimaginably rapid succession. This was a great episode for fans of primitive cave bombs, reckless chasm-jumping, ill-advised derring-do, amateur beachside amputations and bedside waterboarding. My heart was softened by the reappearance of Horace the Pug early on, and as events raced by I alternated between mildly weepy and completely broken. Then Valentine met his half-siblings and I was all puddle.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s hard to know where to start with this episode, where as many things happened in one hour\u2019s screen time as have happened in the previous four series. And yet it was masterfully managed. Most importantly, though, Horace the Pug returned! He\u2019s put on weight. But obviously that\u2019s his prerogative. Not content with addressing each other in the third person, Dr Enys and Sindy Doll were now speaking to each other exclusively through the dog. I do love these two \u2013 and their chemistry is a great compliment to that of Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson. These pairings \u2013 alongside the contrasting charms of Jack Farthing (Sir Evil George) and Heida (Ghost Elizabeth) \u2013 have been the backbone of this show.

No! They\u2019re as bad as the terrible tincture Elizabeth took. Bring Dr Enys and his unproven methods to Sir Evil George. A hearty salute to Jack Farthing for inhabiting this difficult role so excellently; even Cary Warleggan thought the waterboarding was a bit much.

(Not enough Prudie in this series. We demand a Prudie spinoff series, please, alongside the spinoff series for Sir Evil George\u2019s chin.) And moody Tess is superb. \u201cWe aren\u2019t all lucky enough to sell our body to our master for the price of a wedding ring.\u201d Way to tell Demelza to check her privilege.</p> \n<p>The learnin\u2019 and the smashin\u2019 of prejudice around mental illness, gender and race weigh heavy this series. Was Demelza and Morwenna\u2019s literacy project a step too far? Probably, but never mind. \u201cTruly difference betwixt commons and learned is simply that: learnin\u2019.\u201d Fortunately Poldark has earned the privilege to preach like this and they\u2019re just about getting away with it so far. We shall see if it all gets a bit much as the series progresses.</p> \n<h2>Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor</h2> \n<p>T\u2019is a shameful fact that until now, the music has never been mentioned here over five series. Time to remedy that. This week I want to give a melodic tavern shout-out to the composer of the soaring Poldark earworm, Anne Dudley. The theme tune that plays over the title credits is an orchestral arrangement designed \u201cto underscore the Cornish sweeping landscapes and passionate love story.\u201d Top marks to Dudley, who won an Oscar for best score for The Full Monty and has worked on arrangements for The Pet Shop Boys, Elton John and Pulp. May many over-filled tankards be raised aloft to all the excellent musicians involved, and especially to lead violinist Chris Garrick. I have such a Pavlovian response to this theme now (causing immediate lowering of blood pressure) that I am going to miss the music almost as much as Demelza\u2019s National Velvet outfit. </p> \n<h2>Classic Poldark lines</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cNed, I think we\u2019re wanted elsewhere.\u201d The best way ever to say to someone, \u201cIt\u2019s time to leave.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cSir George has been called away to the \u2026 north \u2026 of England.\u201d AKA: his bedroom from which banging can be heard. The barbaric north! Genius prevarication.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cMeanwhile I\u2019m supposed to look Morwenna and Caroline in the face and tell them you\u2019ve all gone fishing?\u201d \u201cExcellent idea.\u201d Ross and Demelza\u2019s relationship in a nutshell.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cI\u2019ve lost one son to greedy mine-owners, I won\u2019t lose another to highfalutin nonsense.\u201d I would give an Academy Award to John Macneill (Jacka Hoblyn, father of Tommy) purely for his delivery of this line which was beyond reproach in impossible circumstances. One of the great things about Poldark is the strong ensemble cast, many of whom have been in the series since the beginning and inhabit their background roles as if they really are living in the period. Tricorns off to all.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cI do hold a finger to my tongue. I do hold a finger waiting.\u201d A strange song, t\u2019were indeed, but Demelza sang it well.</p> \n<h2>Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment</h2> \n<p>As I have predicted, due to the intervention of Aidan Turner\u2019s agent, all of Ross\u2019s feats of derring-do in a hot and sweaty underground cave were conducted not only fully clothed but wearing a fully buttoned-up shirt and an extra waistcoat. Instead we got naked Demelza in the bath. We don\u2019t want naked Demelza in the bath, we want her in her National Velvet costume!</p> \n<h2>Next week</h2> \n<p>Sir Evil George has taken refuge in a world of shadows. Morwenna goes back to her son. Ned goes on the attack. It\u2019s all kicking off, as we would expect as we approach the midway point \u2026</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c3dc92f8-9b66-4c99-b0b2-64553a6a54e6\"

Instead we got naked Demelza in the bath. We don\u2019t want naked Demelza in the bath, we want her in her National Velvet costume! Next week Sir Evil George has taken refuge in a world of shadows. Morwenna goes back to her son. Ned goes on the attack. It\u2019s all kicking off, as we would expect as we approach the midway point \u2026",

      "bodyText": "The parents of the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox say little progress has been made to heal toxic divisions in society since she was killed by a far-right extremist in 2016. They were speaking at the end of a 288-mile charity bike ride in support of a charity set up by the family after her death. Forty cyclists rode from her Batley and Spen constituency to central London over five days to symbolise her journey from her home to becoming an MP. The ride included 1,820 metres of hill climbing on the first day, and challenges from last week\u2019s record-breaking heatwave. At the end of the journey, Cox\u2019s family said divisions in society and the \u201ctoxicity\u201d of the discourse in public life had worsened since her death. Her father, Gordon Leadbeater, said: \u201cAfter Jo\u2019s murder, a lot of people spoke the right words about how it was time to heal some of the divisions in the community. Sadly I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a lot of progress and there are one or two individuals in all areas of the spectrum who seem to be making things worse.\u201d Referring to a plaque in parliament in her memory, her father said he wished the individuals concerned \u201cwould turn around and look at that before they open their mouths\u201d. \u201cNo one disagrees with what Jo stood for \u2013 more in common, treating one another with respect.\u201d Cox\u2019s father and her mother, Jean, said the charity bike ride was one way they hoped to leave a legacy for their daughter\u2019s two young children. Gordon said: \u201cIt would have been easy for us to sit at home and pull the curtains but that is not what Jo would have wanted.\u201d One of Cox\u2019s Labour colleagues, Bermondsey and Old Southwark MP Neil Coyle, called the event \u201can extension of the positivity that is Jo\u2019s legacy\u201d. Coyle added: \u201cWe have a really volatile national situation and I think the country is at a crossroads and is still deeply divided after the referendum. \u201cAnything that helps bring people together through Jo\u2019s legacy is really important and we don\u2019t celebrate when it happens enough.

The teenager put his success down to the many hours he has devoted to Fortnite since the day it came out in September 2017, sometimes playing it for up to eight hours a day.</p> \n<p>\u201cMe and my mum, we clash quite a lot,\u201d Ashman told the BBC. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand how it worked, so she thought that I was spending eight hours a day in my room just wasting my time. So now that I\u2019ve proved to her I can do stuff, I\u2019m really happy.\u201d</p> \n<p>His mother, Lisa Dallman, said she once threw out an Xbox after an argument but now accepted his career choice as a professional esport player. He got into gaming watching his uncle play the shooter Gears of War, before getting his own Xbox aged six.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"12da897b-2587-4cf0-a974-48466c48a579\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Fortnite: Battle Royale</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When was it released?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it so popular with kids?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there violence? And is it addictive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements \u2013 nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers \u2013 into one package that is free to download.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dallman told the BBC: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest with you, I\u2019ve been quite against him gaming.

Second, the Alps/final mountain stage coming right at the end meant that so much more was in balance till the end, I feel like in most past tours the last few days before Paris have been without mountain drama. Third, I think that because JA was not considered a GC threat he was allowed to gain more time than was wise at the outset, and because he climbs pretty well and time trials very well, he managed to hang on to it longer than anyone imagined. Fourth, Froome\u2019s injury seemingly made Ineos less dominant, and Ineos still had to deal with a two-headed team leader, which led to confusion, and less dominance, no real boss of the tour and its pace. Imagine if Froome was there and the two leaders were him and G, with Egan left to be their super mountain helper, following team orders and not pursuing his own glory?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Nicely done. We had a teacher at school called Mr Gilman, and he was once on what was known as bus-stop duty. This involved making sure everyone - and we\u2019re talking around 1000 kids - got onto buses going down Camden Road in orderly fashion. Part of the job was also making sure members of the public were allowed to get on first, and he once ushered someone on, who took exception to the effrontery of being told what he could do. So he gave him a slap. I\u2019d like to say no one laughed. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3dd6b18f08d0b6ca539650\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T17:10:29.674Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u201cI used to be in the overrated camp,\u201d</strong> says Michael Ireton of Paris. \u2018Then I studied art and architectural history.

But this year they struggled to control things, and the race erupted into flamboyance, chaos and attacks, with a leader no one foresaw and a winner most didn\u2019t expect for a few years. It\u2019s almost a shame he\u2019s part of the Ineos machine, but perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have won without it.

      "bodyText": "Sorry, just as I was checking out, I saw Bernal enjoying the moment with his younger brother. I think my eyeballs might be sweating. Ta-ra. So I guess this is it. Thanks all for your company and comments over the last three weeks \u2013 it\u2019s been great. Enjoy the rest of your weekend, and see you again next year. Au revoir! And here\u2019s one celebrating the champ. Here\u2019s the report of today\u2019s frolics. Ewan says he had tears in his eyes when they rolled onto the Champs Elysees, and can\u2019t believe he won. The race started badly for him but the second half has been great. He says the finish was messy and he was quite far back but he was patient and went down the right even though he\u2019d been told not to, but had enough speed to get it done. Ienos pose for photos, Bernal in the middle, resplendent in yellow. Glorious. The top finishers today: 1. Caleb Ewan 2. Dylan Groenewegen 3. Niccolo Bonifazio 4. Max Richeze 5. Edvald Boasson Hagen And the top in the general classification: 1. Egan Bernal 2. Geraint Thomas 3. Steven Kruijswijk 4. Emanuel Buchmann 5. Julian Alaphilippe Didn\u2019t Ewan enjoy that moment, charging away to celebrate. He and Groenewegen picked separate wings of path, and he had just that little bit more pace. So there we go! What a Tour it\u2019s been! Caleb Ewan is one one! He steals it down the side and on the line! Sagan is nicely placed but here comes Groenewegen! He\u2019s gone very early! Alaphilippe is at the front, scouting for his mates; Viviani is a little further back than he\u2019d like. They absolutely cane through the subway and up the hill! Here we go! Down the side of the Seine they go, Mitchelton-Scott at the front. There are just so many absolute kings in this peloton. I\u2019ve not a clue what\u2019s going to happen next. Greg Van Avermaet goes! There goes the bell and here we go! 6.6km to go! \u201cWhat a fantastic finish,\u201d says Neil Blackshaw. \u201cThere is no more beautiful city than Paris, it takes your breath away and it is doing the race proud. What a spectacle.\u201d Absolutely. Meanwhile, Matthews has to change bikes and is absolutely devastated. We\u2019re back in a pack! Nibali leads the peloton. 13.6km to go, or two laps. This is going to be such a finish. The gap\u2019s down to 11s as just off the front, the teams gather and jostle. Three laps to go and the front four are still the front four, leading by 20s. Paris is still absolutely poppin\u2019. There he is! We see Bernal, who gives the camera a V for victory. 22! The group are 28s ahead now, with 23.9km to go. Could this be a decisive break? Surely not. Elite sport during the working day is basically the greatest thing in the world, but worry now \u2013 the Ashes is almost upon us. The front four look strong, lined up and swapping the lead to use the slipstreams. Four laps to go... It\u2019s getting dark now and the lights are making things look divine. It\u2019s nice. They\u2019re setting it up and setting it up; the pace is pretty stiff now, and the sunset in Paris is, frankly, gorgeous. The leaders have 22s with which to play. Five laps and 33.7km to go. \u201cI feel strongly that it is important to make a distinction between someone from rich USA or Canada (the North) winning and someone from Latin America winning,\u201d says Paul Sander. \u201cNo one would wish to take away anything from Greg LeMond but someone from the South winning is a major achievement and should be acknowledged as such. Proud to be living in Latin America.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s fair. I guess cycling is more prone to being bought than most sports, on account of the technology that\u2019s such a big part of it. Tratnik, Fraile, Politt, Scully are the front four; the peloton has caught the rest and the gap is 20s with six laps to go. Cosnefroy has caught up with the second little group; the lead is 26s with 46lm to go. Rosskopf and Van Melsen launch a chase from the peloto and they go around the Arc again. These lads are about six seconds clear. Tratnik leads at the moment, from Politt, Fraile and Scully. 48km to go. \u201cIt\u2019s great not just for Colombia but for the whole of the Americas!\u201d says Paul Griffin. \u201cNot since 1989 has anyone from South or North America won this great race. That it\u2019s been won so thrillingly is the icing on the cake. The cherry on top of the icing is that Bernal, like his predecessor Greg LeMond, seems a decent, straightforward person. You wouldn\u2019t want some despicable, bullying, egotistical maniac winning it. Let\u2019s rejoice that that\u2019s never happened\u201d. \u201cThe Eagle of Toledo will always soar high,\u201d says Gary Naylor. Paris looks amazing from above, the roads fanning out from the Arc. Apparently Chris Froome is ahead of schedule in his rehab, and has started turning pedals over again. \u201cJust a side story,\u201d says Neil Donovan. \u201cThe stage start in Nimes in 40 degree heat, my 13-year-old son started to faint waiting for Peter Sagan to come out of the team bus. Bora were brilliant. Got him into the bus, doctors making sure he was ok etc etc. Riders letting him get selfies and autographs. Bora - our new favourite team!\u201d Sport! Onto the Champs Elysees we go, and the circuits begin with 57.6km to go. Into Paris we go as the lads glide through the streets. What is wrong with people, part 97,503,910? Summat else to read. \u201cI think Paris is fantastic, but used to think it was overrated,\u201d says my colleague Rob Bleaney. \u201cA mate moved there and numerous trips have changed my perspective.\u201d It\u2019s the feelgood story of the summer! Right, I want to go to Paris now. See ya! \u201cReally appreciate the Tour coverage you provided,\u201d says William Hill. \u201cGrateful. Bernal and Ineos were awesome, yet Sagan\u2019s feat is maybe as great - even more so. Maybe overlooked with all the attention directed at yellow. Anyway, thanks for your terrific coverage and look forward to 2020.\u201d All these lads are absolute freaks of nature. Caleb Ewan has never ridden the Champs Elysees so doesn\u2019t know where the smoothest bits are. He\u2019s hoping to find out. 66.6km to go - freaky. We see a crew of Colombians, who cheer their man on. What a feeling that must be. Bloody hell, the Vuelta starts in less than a month. They\u2019re not right, these lads. \u201cAs a Colombian passing thru Tunisia I could only watch German TV to follow the Tour in France,\u201d says says Andres Rengifo. \u201cJust got tired saying all of that! You guys were brilliant, and often your sport and non-sport commentary was the subject of conversation with my friends and fam here and everywhere. Choked up to watch my boy Egan Bernal win at 22 his first Tour de France, and the first one by a Latin American cyclist since..EVER. I still remember back in the 80s when we would wake up early to listen to the Colombian radio broadcast from the interminable climbs of the Alps and the Pyrenees, the time trials, the treacherous stages with pav\u00e9 in Normandy, the falls, the withdrawals, the fevers, and at last, les Champs Elysees. Chochise, Lucho, Fabio, Condorito, Santiago, Nairo, Rigo, Estaban, Fernando, so many names, so much glory. Here: fresh new sound that is just like the one from my childhood. Que viva Colombia carajo!\u201d Thanks Andres! 79.2km to go as a weirdo on the pavement leans into the cyclists\u2019s faces. What makes people do that? \u201cI applaud your coverage these past three weeks,\u201d says Loretta Ebert. \u201cI am in the US and have been hospitalised with a fractured pelvis and your commentary and input from others has kept me sane. The race itself was one of the best in last few years and I applaud Alaphilippe\u2019s courage. I was sorry to see Pinot\u2019s abandonment. He might have made for a thrilling end in the last two stages. As for Paris, a great city but agree the food is overrated.\u201d Gosh, hope you\u2019re on the mend. We\u2019re coming up to Versailles so let\u2019s have a Versailles fact: despite not being in the capital, and not having been home to a royal family for quite sometime, it canes Buckingham Palace for number of visitors. Sagan and his domestique are at the front, Nibali behind them. \u201cAm a touch biased, but 100% agree with your friend-Colombia is grrrreat,\u201d reckons Dav Matter.\u201d I cycle the same roads as Egan near Bogot\u00e1, but currently following the blog from a bus in the Coffee Region, hoping to get to a lovely spot called Salento in time for the coronation.\u201d Greater even than Frosties? \u201cJust so you know, Colombia is better than Brazil,\u201d says Luke Webb, \u201cespecially if you are a cycling fan. Every Sunday they close roads &amp; open them up to cyclists and runners. There\u2019s a 15km 5% climb in Medellin where they close one lane (See last stage of this year\u2019s Tour Colombia).\u201d 91.8km to go. Everyone\u2019s having a nice time. \u201c As others have said, thanks for the Tour coverage,\u201d says Gilman Miller. \u201cI\u2019m no tour historian but my general observations on what made this tour stand out are, first, only one individual time trial and not a terribly long one (this helped Egan limit his losses, and meant that time trialing was not the most valuable skill in determining the winner), the team time trial is stupid, and I would expect and hope that future tours will have a couple time trials again. Second, the Alps/final mountain stage coming right at the end meant that so much more was in balance till the end, I feel like in most past tours the last few days before Paris have been without mountain drama. Third, I think that because JA was not considered a GC threat he was allowed to gain more time than was wise at the outset, and because he climbs pretty well and time trials very well, he managed to hang on to it longer than anyone imagined. Fourth, Froome\u2019s injury seemingly made Ineos less dominant, and Ineos still had to deal with a two-headed team leader, which led to confusion, and less dominance, no real boss of the tour and its pace. Imagine if Froome was there and the two leaders were him and G, with Egan left to be their super mountain helper, following team orders and not pursuing his own glory?\u201d Nicely done. We had a teacher at school called Mr Gilman, and he was once on what was known as bus-stop duty. This involved making sure everyone - and we\u2019re talking around 1000 kids - got onto buses going down Camden Road in orderly fashion. Part of the job was also making sure members of the public were allowed to get on first, and he once ushered someone on, who took exception to the effrontery of being told what he could do. So he gave him a slap. I\u2019d like to say no one laughed. \u201cI used to be in the overrated camp,\u201d says Michael Ireton of Paris. \u2018Then I studied art and architectural history. Now firmly--VERY firmly--in the great city camp. So much art and architecture to see, from age-old to cutting edge contemporary.\u201d I think it was doing A-level European history post-1814 that did it for me, then doing revolution stuff at university. There\u2019s such a sense of serious stuff having happened on the streets. Steven Kruijswijk is pretty chuffed with his third place. \u201cA great feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cToday\u2019s not the day for a punch-up,\u201d says Drew Goldie, \u201cso apologies for this, but if Guy Hornsby didn\u2019t think last year\u2019s Tour was gripping (vis. his reference to Thomas\u2019s speech) I think he\u2019s missing out. The race up to La Rosiere when Thomas took yellow was amazing; and throughout the race no-one - not Froome/Thomas/Sky/their opponents, especially Du Moulin, and me - knew if Froome would eventually fire, and the tension was wonderful. I actually thought Du Moulin might exploit the Sky uncertainty, but it turned out that Thomas exploited Du Moulin\u2019s. Add the usual baffling Movistar tactics, and the permutations were endless. I know it\u2019s fashionable, and very correct, to bemoan the Sky years, and only good manners has prevented most from cheering that Froome\u2019s not here, but last year\u2019s race was compelling.\u201d It\u2019s always the day for a punch-up. Just over 100km to go. Dey Bardet, king of the mountains, takes some congratulations. Paris, then. Overrated, or one of the greatest cities in the world? I\u2019m the former and my missus is closer to the latter. I\u2019d agree with her that the food is overrated - too rich, too bland - but the history is so emotionally overwhelming and there are very few cities of which that can be said. \u201cThanks to the Guardian live blog team,\u201d says the Costa Brava\u2019s Gareth Thomas. \u201cAs I\u2019m watching the TDF in a bar, it\u2019s too noisy to hear the Spanish commentator. With the visuals on the big screen, the commentary from the Guardian live blog, and of course a cold beer, it all works fine!\u201d I just had a swing of water in my north London box room, so we\u2019re in the same zone. I have a friend who reckons that Bernal\u2019s Colombia is the greatest country in South America. I find it hard to see how anywhere can be better than Brazil (the obvious criticism ignored for a moment). Am I wrong? WARNING: minor Anglo-Saxon. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really get \u2018that\u2019 close,\u201d tweets Jeremy CP. \u201cFull stages yesterday and Friday and he may have been 10-20+ minutes down. For a Frenchman, talk about Pinot not Alaphilippe.\u201d Yes, fair enough. Wiggins is with Brailsford, who says winning never gets old, and agrees that Bernal\u2019s maturity exceeds his age. It\u2019s extremely revealing stuff. 114.4km to go. \u201cThis has honestly been the most enjoyable Tour for many many years,\u201d reckons Guy Hornsby. \u201cAnd I say this as a huge British cycling fan who\u2019s been spoilt with a cavalcade of victories in Grand Tours since Wiggins broke through. While those were massive for cycling, the means in which they were achieved were seldom memorable, even with G last year (his winner\u2019s speech was probably the highlight of the race). Sky\u2019s dominance sapped so much enjoyment out of those wins. But this year they struggled to control things, and the race erupted into flamboyance, chaos and attacks, with a leader no one foresaw and a winner most didn\u2019t expect for a few years. It\u2019s almost a shame he\u2019s part of the Ineos machine, but perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have won without it. So thanks for the panache, Julien, the effort G, the climbs Pinot, and the skills, Egan. What a win. Thanks for you lot all too, for making the MBM such fun. My money\u2019s on Caleb Ewan next.\u201d Yes, agreed - sport needs jeopardy. \u201cHello Daniel,\u201d says Alan Amos. With regard to your comment, \u2018I wonder if Alaphilippe can make the necessary improvements between now and next term, or if it\u2019s just a physiological hurdle that he\u2019ll never overcome\u2019: Would he want to try? As far as I can see it, neither he nor his team were aiming at GC in this Tour, nor have Quick-Step had a rider that was capable of taking on such a challenge in the decades that the team has existed. To radically change the aims of the team towards GC in a grand tour for next year would be such a change I couldn\u2019t imagine it happening: at the same time, I can\u2019t see Alaphilippe leaving them. We\u2019ll see what happens next...\u201d Yes, but he got so close \u2013 I know he sort of said he never thought it was on, but the way he responded on the first Alp stage suggested to the contrary. Once people have had a taste... What could they do to make this stage more of a thing and less of a jaunt? Wild animals en route? Sagan photobombs Bernal and Ineos\u2019 moment, then they raise glasses and guzzle. Bernal has another, and Thomas enjoys one too. More news as I get it. We see it slowmo and actually that\u2019s a pretty good neck from yerman, hurled straight down, no fuss. Bernal has champagne in his hand, and clinks flute with whoever\u2019s in the car next to him. He sees it away, lad that he is. Wiggins says the bonhomie on this stage gets boring after a bit. \u201cYou just wanna race.\u201d The stage starts! Alaphilippe pretends to attack, wag that he is. I wonder if Alaphilippe can make the necessary improvements between now and next term, or if it\u2019s just a physiological hurdle that he\u2019ll never overcome. It\u2019s another belting day in France, after that little mountain interlude. Bernal and Alaphilippe blather togather, which is nice to see. Off they head to the start. Bernal looks pretty relaxed, all things considered. The boys are gathered on the line... It\u2019s been an absolutely vintage Tour, packed with all manner of drama, desolation and controversy \u2013 an absolute joy, basically. And in Egan Bernal, cycling has a popular and deserving winner who might just take the sport to new people and places. He\u2019ll enjoy a relaxing little jaunt into Paris this evening, while the sprinters do the work and we blather blather to each other. Start: 5.10pm BST, 6.10pm local time. Reading: This.",

      "bodyText": "Alvaro Bernal, a Colombian corn farmer, traversed the pouring rain to reach the cobbled square in Zipaquir\u00e1, a quaint town in the Andes. His grandson, Egan Bernal, had just won the Tour de France, cycling\u2019s greatest honour, and cemented himself as arguably the most successful sportsman in his nation. \u201cWe\u2019re in love with him,\u201d the 75-year-old said. \u201cThis is a victory for Colombia and for Zipaquir\u00e1.\u201d Bernal, known in his home country as \u201cthe boy wonder\u201d, hails from humble beginnings but has sent records tumbling. He is the first rider from a Latin American country to win the Tour, and at 22 is the youngest champion in 110 years. \u201cHe should know that we love him here,\u201d his grandfather said. Zipaquir\u00e1, a sleepy mountainside town a short drive north of Bogot\u00e1, the capital, draws tourists to its cathedral built in a cavernous salt mine. With its cobbled streets and old colonial buildings it\u2019s the quintessential Andean town. Now its residents have a new reason to celebrate. Bernal\u2019s victory at the Tour, fought over 21 gruelling days, marks arguably the highest achievement for Colombian sports, eclipsing the victory of Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah in the men\u2019s doubles in tennis at Wimbledon just two weeks earlier. Four years ago Bernal was pedalling 20km daily to university in Bogot\u00e1. His training was navigating the region\u2019s hilly climbs and sporadic thunderstorms. When it became clear that Bernal was the champion-in-waiting on Saturday, the central square in Zipaquir\u00e1 filled with supporters. A big screen showed the race live, while confetti rained down from overhead. The crowd cheered in ecstasy; many dressed in the national team\u2019s football shirt, yellow, like the Tour winner\u2019s jersey. Some held their own bicycles aloft. Others waved the national flag. Entrepreneurial hawkers had quickly created shirts emblazoned with their favourite son\u2019s image. The party went on through the night and showed little signs of abating on Sunday morning. Many had cycled in from neighbouring towns to join the celebrations, holding banners aloft as the sun broke through the morning fog. Fabio Hernan Rodr\u00edguez, a local coach, trained Bernal when he was an eight-year-old equipped only with a beaten up mountain bike. \u201cHe was always humble but so driven,\u201d he said, while posing for photographs with wellwishers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a surprise to me. I knew this was coming.\u201d The newspapers could barely contain their excitement. \u201cColombia makes history,\u201d the front page of El Espectador read on Sunday. \u201cYellow fever!\u201d read a headline on the website of El Tiempo. For many Colombians the victory represents a chance for their country to shed its reputation as a nation hamstrung by political violence and drug trafficking. \u201cWe have our problems, but we can achieve anything,\u201d said student Katherine Salinas. In Colombia, cycling is second only to football as the nation\u2019s favourite sport. While across the world, road cycling is often viewed as a rich man\u2019s pursuit, in Colombia it is commonplace. Every weekend cities close their main thoroughfares to cars, allowing cyclists to enjoy the urban streets. Each major race is must-watch television across the country. Colombia\u2019s president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, was similarly generous in his praise for the young champion. \u201cWhat happened today fills us with emotion,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday, when Bernal took an insurmountable lead. Duque went on to mention Nairo Quintana, another Colombian who had been the country\u2019s golden boy of cycling until this weekend, having won the Giro de Italia in 2014 and the Vuelta de Espa\u00f1a two years later. In Zapaquir\u00e1, locals struggled to contain their emotions. \u201cWe are just too happy, we can\u2019t hide it,\u201d said Alfredo Molano, who had travelled from Bogot\u00e1 to celebrate the victory. \u201cThis is phenomenal, it\u2019s immense for Colombia.\u201d For Alvaro Bernal, the champion\u2019s grandfather, the euphoria will eventually fade and life will get back to normal. \u201cWe are here and we are waiting for him to come home,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him yet but we love him very much.\u201d",

The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that freedom of navigation in the strait of Hormuz was \u201cvital not just to the UK, but also our international partners and allies. \u201cWhile we continue to push for a diplomatic resolution that will make this possible again without military accompaniment, the Royal Navy will continue to provide a safeguard for UK vessels until this is the reality.\u201d Commander Tom Trent, the commanding officer of HMS Duncan, said: \u201cWe have relocated from an intense deployment in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, which included support to the French carrier strike group with live operations in Syria.\u201d Last week, the government confirmed that the Royal Navy had been tasked with accompanying British-flagged ships through the strait to provide reassurance to the shipping industry. It followed two sets of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and an attempt by the Iranian navy to push a British oil ship towards Iranian waters. Britain\u2019s relations with Iran worsened when the UK seized an Iranian ship, Grace 1, near Gibraltar earlier this month. The ship was suspected of breaching EU sanctions by carrying oil destined for Syria. Tehran denied the ship was heading for Syria and threatened to seize a British oil tanker in retaliation if it was not released. A British-flagged oil tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard in the shipping route last week. A second British-linked tanker was also boarded by armed guards before being released. On Wednesday, the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani indicated that the captured Stena Impero could be released if the UK returns Grace 1 to Iran. On Sunday, he wrote to Boris Johnson saying that he hoped diplomatic ties between the two countries would be stronger under the leadership of the new prime minister. In the letter, published on his website, he congratulated Johnson, and said he hoped his \u201conly one visit to Tehran\u201d when foreign secretary in 2017 and now his tenure as PM would lead to a \u201cfurther deepening of bilateral and multilateral relations\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s most senior judge has appealed for people to give money to a charity whose volunteers support those who become embroiled in civil court cases but cannot afford a lawyer. Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, asked on Sunday for donations to the Personal Support Unit. She made this week\u2019s Radio 4 Appeal, a BBC programme in which well-known people ask for donations to charities. \u201cI know how intimidating the civil and family courts can be for people without legal knowledge or help,\u201d Lady Hale, patron of the Personal Support Unit, told listeners. \u201cEveryone deserves access to justice whether or not they can afford a lawyer.\u201d She told the story of a woman helped by the legal advice charity after becoming involved in a family court fight with a former partner. Protracted austerity since 2012 has reduced funding by about \u00a3950m a year in real terms, causing an alarming rise in the number of people forced to represent themselves. Lady Hale\u2019s appeal is likely to reignite the controversy over cuts. The number of people receiving legal aid has fallen more than 80% in eight years. Critics say the result is unnecessary conflict and stress, and unsatisfactory justice. A year ago, the then most senior family court judge in England and Wales talked about problems caused by increasing numbers of people who found themselves without lawyers. Sir James Munby discussed the effects of cuts in legal aid at a press conference to mark his retirement as president of the family division of the high court. \u201cThe fact is that we have far more litigants in person in the family courts now than we did,\u201d Sir James said in July 2018. \u201cThe problem is in private law cases, that is cases where the disputes are within the family, not between the family and the local authority, and by and large legal aid is no longer available for private law cases unless there\u2019s been an allegation and evidence of domestic violence. \u201cThe consequence has been that very large numbers of people are now coming to court without representation.\u201d He added that has brought into prominence a number of problems.",

On Sunday they return to the Gabba to close out Round 20 against the Western Bulldogs, who shrugged off last week\u2019s loss to St Kilda to blow the doors of Fremantle at the Docklands and have them a step closer to playing finals for the first time since the 2016 premiership. Like then, you sense the flag could be won by the team that can \u201cbring the bottled lightning, a clean tumbler and a corkscrew\u201d at the right time of year. Looking at it right now, with the ladder topped by the L-W-L-W-L-W Cats, the teams poised holding the corkscrew are the Lions and Tigers. Conversely, the sixth-placed Collingwood and eighth-placed Adelaide have four weeks to try and force a solution from the soup. On the weekend\u2019s showing, that appears something of a stretch.",

      "body": "<p>The Wallabies are enjoying a rare moment in the sun after their gritty 16-10 win against Argentina on Saturday night, but a long, dark cloud is drifting across the Tasman.</p> <p>The Wallabies almost always beat Argentina and they almost always win at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, so in a way their victory against the Pumas was only a perfunctory victory. But after suffering their worst season since 1958 last year and coming off a 35-17 loss to the Springboks in Johannesburg the previous week, a win\u2019s a win for the Wallabies.</p> <p>With the World Cup in Japan around the corner, the Wallabies needed to experience the exhilarating feeling of victory to restore self-belief to a team that had gotten used to losing. Indeed, there was much to like about the Wallabies\u2019 performance, none more so than that of five-eighth Christian Lealiifano, the cancer survivor who showed so much courage to resume his rugby career, let alone play Test football again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/27/wallabies-show-pre-world-cup-promise-in-holding-off-pumas\">Wallabies show pre-World Cup promise in holding off Pumas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At 31 years of age, Lealiifano may not be as quick as he used to be nor as physical, but it is his beautiful mind that separates him from the other playmakers in the Wallabies squad. Lealiifano at five-eighth is like having an assistant coach on the field. He created the Wallabies\u2019 sole try to winger Reece Hodge by executing a rehearsed move from a scrum. Using big centres Samu Kerevi and Tevita Kuridrani as decoys, Lealiifano put blind winger Marike Koroibete into a gap and, two passes later, Hodge was over.</p> <p>Lealiifano\u2019s abilities as a communicator and an organiser were most noticeable after he left the field in the 51st minute, when the Wallabies\u2019 play started to degenerate badly. But the main reason Michael Cheika should seriously consider starting Lealiifano at five-eighth in the World Cup is his style of play suits the Wallabies better than the other number 10 candidates. Lealiifano takes the ball to the line better than the other options and has the ability to execute a flat attack under pressure.</p> <p>It was appropriate the Wallabies\u2019 try originated from a scrum, an area of the game they dominated so strongly. In a reversal of form from Johannesburg, the Wallabies were awarded five scrum penalties against a team renowned for its scrummaging and coached by former Wallabies scrum coach Mario Ledesma. If the Wallabies can maintain that solid platform, it will be a major plus for them at the World Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/19/wallabies-begin-rugby-championship-seeking-fine-balance-ahead-of-world-cup\">Wallabies begin Rugby Championship seeking balance ahead of World Cup | Bret Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other pleasing feature of the Wallabies\u2019 game was their defence. Unlike most other major teams that employ a rush defence, the Wallabies are using an almost passive rugby league-style defensive pattern, emphasising patience and discipline, which they call \u201csoaking\u201d. The Wallabies managed to restrict Argentina to one try, but the Pumas are not a prolific try-scoring team. They also seemed a bit flat after going so close to beating the All Blacks in Buenos Aires the previous week and did not threaten much.</p> <p>After leaking so many tries last year, the Wallabies had to try something different, but their new defensive system has not yet been fully tested. It will be interesting to see how the Wallabies\u2019 new defensive pattern works against the All Blacks in the opening Bledisloe Cup Test in Perth on Saturday week because the Kiwis will take and use whatever time and space is given to them.</p> <p>For all the good things the Wallabies did against the Pumas, there are areas they will need to markedly improve if they are to be successful in the Bledisloe Cup and the World Cup. While the Wallabies are heavily focused on getting across the advantage-line, they do not always seem to know what to do once they get there. The Pumas dropped a lot of ball in attack, but there was little effective counter-attack from the Wallabies. And their skills still need to be honed a lot sharper. Hodge may not have scored his try against a better defensive team because of some of the poor passing in the attacking move that led up to it.</p> <p>It is difficult to read too much into the form of the phony war that is the Rugby Championship. The All Blacks have not been at the top of their game, beating Argentina narrowly and drawing with the Springboks. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has been in experimental mode to prepare for the World Cup, but the Kiwis will start to get serious in the Bledisloe Cup. The All Blacks have held it since 2003. Significantly, Hansen is departing after the World Cup. He will not want to be known as the coach who lost the Bledisloe Cup, particularly as he will not have a chance to regain it.</p> <p>New Zealand have to win only one of two Bledisloe Tests to retain the cup. At some point in the series, the All Blacks will produce close to their best rugby and the Wallabies will need to be ready for the dark cloud that is surely coming \u2013 or their time in the sun will be brief.</p>",

The Wallabies almost always beat Argentina and they almost always win at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, so in a way their victory against the Pumas was only a perfunctory victory. But after suffering their worst season since 1958 last year and coming off a 35-17 loss to the Springboks in Johannesburg the previous week, a win\u2019s a win for the Wallabies. With the World Cup in Japan around the corner, the Wallabies needed to experience the exhilarating feeling of victory to restore self-belief to a team that had gotten used to losing. Indeed, there was much to like about the Wallabies\u2019 performance, none more so than that of five-eighth Christian Lealiifano, the cancer survivor who showed so much courage to resume his rugby career, let alone play Test football again. At 31 years of age, Lealiifano may not be as quick as he used to be nor as physical, but it is his beautiful mind that separates him from the other playmakers in the Wallabies squad. Lealiifano at five-eighth is like having an assistant coach on the field. He created the Wallabies\u2019 sole try to winger Reece Hodge by executing a rehearsed move from a scrum. Using big centres Samu Kerevi and Tevita Kuridrani as decoys, Lealiifano put blind winger Marike Koroibete into a gap and, two passes later, Hodge was over. Lealiifano\u2019s abilities as a communicator and an organiser were most noticeable after he left the field in the 51st minute, when the Wallabies\u2019 play started to degenerate badly. But the main reason Michael Cheika should seriously consider starting Lealiifano at five-eighth in the World Cup is his style of play suits the Wallabies better than the other number 10 candidates. Lealiifano takes the ball to the line better than the other options and has the ability to execute a flat attack under pressure. It was appropriate the Wallabies\u2019 try originated from a scrum, an area of the game they dominated so strongly. In a reversal of form from Johannesburg, the Wallabies were awarded five scrum penalties against a team renowned for its scrummaging and coached by former Wallabies scrum coach Mario Ledesma. If the Wallabies can maintain that solid platform, it will be a major plus for them at the World Cup. The other pleasing feature of the Wallabies\u2019 game was their defence. Unlike most other major teams that employ a rush defence, the Wallabies are using an almost passive rugby league-style defensive pattern, emphasising patience and discipline, which they call \u201csoaking\u201d. The Wallabies managed to restrict Argentina to one try, but the Pumas are not a prolific try-scoring team. They also seemed a bit flat after going so close to beating the All Blacks in Buenos Aires the previous week and did not threaten much. After leaking so many tries last year, the Wallabies had to try something different, but their new defensive system has not yet been fully tested. It will be interesting to see how the Wallabies\u2019 new defensive pattern works against the All Blacks in the opening Bledisloe Cup Test in Perth on Saturday week because the Kiwis will take and use whatever time and space is given to them. For all the good things the Wallabies did against the Pumas, there are areas they will need to markedly improve if they are to be successful in the Bledisloe Cup and the World Cup. While the Wallabies are heavily focused on getting across the advantage-line, they do not always seem to know what to do once they get there. The Pumas dropped a lot of ball in attack, but there was little effective counter-attack from the Wallabies. And their skills still need to be honed a lot sharper. Hodge may not have scored his try against a better defensive team because of some of the poor passing in the attacking move that led up to it. It is difficult to read too much into the form of the phony war that is the Rugby Championship. The All Blacks have not been at the top of their game, beating Argentina narrowly and drawing with the Springboks. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has been in experimental mode to prepare for the World Cup, but the Kiwis will start to get serious in the Bledisloe Cup. The All Blacks have held it since 2003. Significantly, Hansen is departing after the World Cup. He will not want to be known as the coach who lost the Bledisloe Cup, particularly as he will not have a chance to regain it. New Zealand have to win only one of two Bledisloe Tests to retain the cup. At some point in the series, the All Blacks will produce close to their best rugby and the Wallabies will need to be ready for the dark cloud that is surely coming \u2013 or their time in the sun will be brief.",

      "bodyText": "There is one experience that almost all Newstart recipients might share in common: skipping meals to get by on $40 a day. The resounding response to a survey of about 500 Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients suggests many are missing multiple meals each week. As political support grows for an increase to Newstart, the Australian Council of Social Service surveyed people on the payment about how they get by on $277.85-per-week. It found 84% of those who responded said they had skipped meals to save money. And of those that were skipping meals, 30% said they missed between three and four each week. A further 13% went without food at least eight times a week. \u201cI regularly don\u2019t eat at all,\u201d one survey respondent said. The Morrison government has so far fended off calls for a $75 a week increase to the unemployment benefit, which is advocated by Acoss and the Greens. Labor, which has joined the push without nominating a figure, backed a Greens proposal to hold a Senate inquiry last week. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said people were skipping meals because of the \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d payment. \u201cOur survey shows people can\u2019t afford rent, food, energy, clothing, transport, haircuts, dental care or internet access, which severely hampers their chances of getting a job, especially as there is only one job available for every eight people looking,\u201d she said. Other findings include the 65% respondents who said they didn\u2019t eat meat to save money, and around the same proportion said they didn\u2019t use a heater or cooling. More than 60% reported that they had not been able to see a dentist in two years. Some survey respondents reported halving their medication and only showering sporadically to save electricity. \u201cI am no longer purchasing food that requires refrigeration so that I can turn the fridge off,\u201d one respondent said. While single, childless Newstart recipients who receive the base rate are commonly thought to live on $40 a day, the figure does not take into account bills and other expenses. Asked how much they were left with after paying for housing, nearly 60% said they had less than $100 left for the week after they paid their housing costs. A further 39% reported having $50 or less. A separate Salvation Army report has found that people on Newstart live on $17 a day on average after accommodation costs. Despite the government\u2019s claims that Australia\u2019s safety net was the best in the world, Guardian Australia reported last week that the Newstart allowance is considered one of the lowest unemployment payments in the OECD. Departmental data, meanwhile, disproves the claim made by Coalition frontbenchers that most people on Newstart are only on the payment for a short period. In fact, at December 2018, the average was three years. A $75 a week boost would cost about $3bn a year.",

Six years in purgatory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/07/australia-pat-cummins-injury\" title=\"\">injury after injury</a> limiting him to the odd white-ball match and the physio room.

A bowler who seethes with pace but also shows a mastery of seam movement and aggressive lines. A refusal to give in, the kind who forces a wicket when batsmen are on top. A hard striker of the ball with a classical technique and patience for days. A dash of matinee idol: tall, straight, with a high-beam smile. A courteous manner with everyone he meets. None of the nuggety, sunburned grumpiness of Australian cricket cliche.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/13/pat-cummins-interview-australia-ashes\">Pat Cummins: 'Being intimidating is about using body language' | Sam Perry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is also clear from Cummins is his sense of perspective: more deliberate and relaxed than some of his forebears. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/11/england-australia-cricket-world-cup-semi-final-report\" title=\"\">the lost World Cup semi-final?</a> \u201cI went and lay by the beach in France,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cI deliberately chose that when I was looking for places. Somewhere no one speaks English and no one knows what cricket is. I try and grab every chance I can to switch off, especially on a long tour. A couple of days away feels like a week.\u201d</p> <p>He was philosophical about that game: disappointed to fall so close, proud of progress from the shambles of a few months earlier. Not that he was shrugging at the silverware. Plenty of people forget Cummins played in Australia\u2019s winning 2015 campaign, though he never will.</p> <p>\u201cJust about my career highlight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a tournament where I felt lucky to be in that 15, I was there and thereabouts in the ODI team the entire time but never felt like I\u2019d cemented a spot. It\u2019s a once-in-a-career opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/live/2015/mar/29/cricket-world-cup-2015-final-australia-new-zealand-live\" title=\"\">play a World Cup at home</a>, I was 21 and right in the mixer.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s the Ashes that really have his attention, where he thinks Australia have a better chance to compete. And it was another 2015 tour, when he reprised his fringe role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/23/ashes-2015-ratings-england-australia\" title=\"\">in that year\u2019s Ashes</a>, that he thinks can help him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever bowled with a Dukes ball before,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great environment to learn, and to see guys like Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in their home conditions go about their work, see how Aussie guys deal with the pressure of an away series, being right there in the middle of it without having the stresses of playing. I feel like I\u2019m better equipped for this time around.\u201d</p> <p>On that tour and in this year\u2019s World Cup, English conditions agreed with him. \u201cThere always seems to be sideways movement and the Dukes ball, even if it goes soft, still has a bit of swing. It\u2019s not 40 degrees so you can run in all day. It feels like if you put into the wicket you\u2019re going to get something out of it. It levels the contest sometimes as opposed to a flat day-three or day-four wicket in Australia or a flat ODI wicket, sometimes you go into defence mode. Over here you can always sense a wicket coming.\u201d</p> <p>Cummins had more injury delays after 2015 and it was a flat wicket when he first returned to Tests for Australia\u2019s 2017 draw in Ranchi. But he immediately showed what cricket had been missing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qv81iLVtKQ\" title=\"\">by whistling down bouncers</a> at the helmets of India\u2019s batsmen, bowling with proper pace on the somnolent track.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d played one [Sheffield] Shield game, a few ODIs, and suddenly I was on the flight,\u201d he says. \u201cI got over there really excited, I was bowling well and I couldn\u2019t believe I was back in the Test side quicker than I\u2019d hoped to be. I played a lot of grade cricket or time in the nets where I was managing my body, but all that goes out the window. You\u2019re playing for Australia in a Test match, doing anything you can to win it. Maybe it was handbrake off. Maybe that gives more clarity.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/30/pat-cummins-australian-fast-bowlers\">Pat Cummins the coming man provides dilemma for Australian cricket | Mike Selvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the rest of that year each Cummins spell was heart in mouth. When would he break down again? But he played twice in India, then all five Ashes Tests, then four in South Africa. \u201cThe physios and doctors always told me this is normal, once you get a couple more years of cricket you\u2019ll get a good run. It\u2019s hard to believe until you get there.\u201d His body has been repaying those lost years since.</p> <p>There was no sterner test than Johannesburg 2018, Cummins flying the flag all but alone while Australia were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/03/south-africa-v-australia-fourth-test-day-five-live\" title=\"\">demolished after the sandpaper storm</a>. One impressed observer was the South Africa captain, Faf du Plessis. \u201cWe would sit on the side of the field and just admire what he does. We\u2019d say, \u2018Look at the guy, he\u2019s still running in and bowling quick.\u2019 Diving at balls when he\u2019s just finished an eight-over spell, runs in the series. As a batter I definitely felt he was the biggest challenge. He\u2019s a nice guy, Pat. You enjoy it when nice guys do well, even opposition, the good people of the game.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"142bed2048d0ee692d8496296eb40791c8f16d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/142bed2048d0ee692d8496296eb40791c8f16d32/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Cummins batting in the World Cup semi-final defeat by England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat Cummins batting in the World Cup semi-final defeat by England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even England supporters may have to like him. His cricket wins respect, his conduct wins regard. In Johannesburg last year he was one of the first to speak plainly of Australia\u2019s sledging: \u201cIf we talk about abuse it\u2019s certainly over the line and that\u2019s not pure emotion, that\u2019s pre-planned bullying sometimes, and we\u2019ve all been guilty of that.\u201d</p> <p>Now he says that \u201csport\u2019s quite emotional and there will definitely be times on the field when those emotions show through, but it\u2019s about trying to manage how we show them\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps his years on the sidelines have helped Cummins be a bit more objective, in the same way that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/10/australia-captain-tim-paine-expects-hostile-crowds-in-england\" title=\"\">emergency captain Tim Paine\u2019s own years</a> in the injury wilderness made him enough of an outsider to be a credible reformer of team and culture.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably the first time where we\u2019ve really had to sit back and think about how we wanted to play,\u201d Cummins says of the start of Paine\u2019s tenure. \u201cFor me personally, going to university or having a few pre-seasons trying to recover from injury, it\u2019s just knowing that you can\u2019t judge yourself on purely cricket, because if you do then you\u2019re forever riding this rollercoaster. Definitely taking a step back gives you time to actually think.\u201d</p> <p>Do not mistake any of that for going easy, though. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve always played is to get into the fight,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a side that\u2019s really hungry, many of them in their first Ashes, their first away Test. For me it\u2019s about remembering what I did well last time against England, try to adjust to English conditions, but I just want to really make a mark. It doesn\u2019t get much bigger for a Test player than an Ashes, and you never know if it\u2019s going to be your last. So make the most of it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Most people in cricket know the Pat Cummins story. The teen prodigy, man of the match in his first Test aged 18, bowling like the wind to smash through South Africa before his vital runs sealed an absurd victory chase. Six years in purgatory, injury after injury limiting him to the odd white-ball match and the physio room. Then the comeback that has made him the No 1 Test bowler in the world and winner of the Allan Border medal for Australia\u2019s male cricketer of the year. Cummins the person is as compelling. A bowler who seethes with pace but also shows a mastery of seam movement and aggressive lines. A refusal to give in, the kind who forces a wicket when batsmen are on top. A hard striker of the ball with a classical technique and patience for days. A dash of matinee idol: tall, straight, with a high-beam smile. A courteous manner with everyone he meets. None of the nuggety, sunburned grumpiness of Australian cricket cliche. What is also clear from Cummins is his sense of perspective: more deliberate and relaxed than some of his forebears. After the lost World Cup semi-final? \u201cI went and lay by the beach in France,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cI deliberately chose that when I was looking for places. Somewhere no one speaks English and no one knows what cricket is. I try and grab every chance I can to switch off, especially on a long tour. A couple of days away feels like a week.\u201d He was philosophical about that game: disappointed to fall so close, proud of progress from the shambles of a few months earlier. Not that he was shrugging at the silverware. Plenty of people forget Cummins played in Australia\u2019s winning 2015 campaign, though he never will. \u201cJust about my career highlight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a tournament where I felt lucky to be in that 15, I was there and thereabouts in the ODI team the entire time but never felt like I\u2019d cemented a spot. It\u2019s a once-in-a-career opportunity to play a World Cup at home, I was 21 and right in the mixer.\u201d But it\u2019s the Ashes that really have his attention, where he thinks Australia have a better chance to compete. And it was another 2015 tour, when he reprised his fringe role in that year\u2019s Ashes, that he thinks can help him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever bowled with a Dukes ball before,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great environment to learn, and to see guys like Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in their home conditions go about their work, see how Aussie guys deal with the pressure of an away series, being right there in the middle of it without having the stresses of playing. I feel like I\u2019m better equipped for this time around.\u201d On that tour and in this year\u2019s World Cup, English conditions agreed with him. \u201cThere always seems to be sideways movement and the Dukes ball, even if it goes soft, still has a bit of swing. It\u2019s not 40 degrees so you can run in all day. It feels like if you put into the wicket you\u2019re going to get something out of it. It levels the contest sometimes as opposed to a flat day-three or day-four wicket in Australia or a flat ODI wicket, sometimes you go into defence mode. Over here you can always sense a wicket coming.\u201d Cummins had more injury delays after 2015 and it was a flat wicket when he first returned to Tests for Australia\u2019s 2017 draw in Ranchi. But he immediately showed what cricket had been missing by whistling down bouncers at the helmets of India\u2019s batsmen, bowling with proper pace on the somnolent track. \u201cI\u2019d played one [Sheffield] Shield game, a few ODIs, and suddenly I was on the flight,\u201d he says. \u201cI got over there really excited, I was bowling well and I couldn\u2019t believe I was back in the Test side quicker than I\u2019d hoped to be. I played a lot of grade cricket or time in the nets where I was managing my body, but all that goes out the window. You\u2019re playing for Australia in a Test match, doing anything you can to win it. Maybe it was handbrake off. Maybe that gives more clarity.\u201d For the rest of that year each Cummins spell was heart in mouth. When would he break down again? But he played twice in India, then all five Ashes Tests, then four in South Africa. \u201cThe physios and doctors always told me this is normal, once you get a couple more years of cricket you\u2019ll get a good run. It\u2019s hard to believe until you get there.\u201d His body has been repaying those lost years since. There was no sterner test than Johannesburg 2018, Cummins flying the flag all but alone while Australia were demolished after the sandpaper storm. One impressed observer was the South Africa captain, Faf du Plessis. \u201cWe would sit on the side of the field and just admire what he does. We\u2019d say, \u2018Look at the guy, he\u2019s still running in and bowling quick.\u2019 Diving at balls when he\u2019s just finished an eight-over spell, runs in the series. As a batter I definitely felt he was the biggest challenge. He\u2019s a nice guy, Pat. You enjoy it when nice guys do well, even opposition, the good people of the game.\u201d Even England supporters may have to like him. His cricket wins respect, his conduct wins regard. In Johannesburg last year he was one of the first to speak plainly of Australia\u2019s sledging: \u201cIf we talk about abuse it\u2019s certainly over the line and that\u2019s not pure emotion, that\u2019s pre-planned bullying sometimes, and we\u2019ve all been guilty of that.\u201d Now he says that \u201csport\u2019s quite emotional and there will definitely be times on the field when those emotions show through, but it\u2019s about trying to manage how we show them\u201d. Perhaps his years on the sidelines have helped Cummins be a bit more objective, in the same way that emergency captain Tim Paine\u2019s own years in the injury wilderness made him enough of an outsider to be a credible reformer of team and culture. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the first time where we\u2019ve really had to sit back and think about how we wanted to play,\u201d Cummins says of the start of Paine\u2019s tenure. \u201cFor me personally, going to university or having a few pre-seasons trying to recover from injury, it\u2019s just knowing that you can\u2019t judge yourself on purely cricket, because if you do then you\u2019re forever riding this rollercoaster. Definitely taking a step back gives you time to actually think.\u201d Do not mistake any of that for going easy, though. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve always played is to get into the fight,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a side that\u2019s really hungry, many of them in their first Ashes, their first away Test. For me it\u2019s about remembering what I did well last time against England, try to adjust to English conditions, but I just want to really make a mark. It doesn\u2019t get much bigger for a Test player than an Ashes, and you never know if it\u2019s going to be your last. So make the most of it.\u201d",

The charity\u2019s chief executive, Sarah Lindsell, said: \u201cWe are so very happy and thrilled for Ella and Matt on the birth of Skye, and send our warmest congratulations. \u201cWe are honoured to have worked alongside them since Matt\u2019s mother, Tessa Jowell, lost her life to brain cancer last year, and we are hugely grateful for their ongoing support as we honour her legacy by striving to improve the life of everyone diagnosed with a brain tumour.\u201d Ella became famous after starting the food blog Deliciously Ella in 2012. She has subsequently written three books and pioneered the clean eating movement, although she claimed never to have used that phrase. The Guardian called her books \u201carguably the most successful fad diet cookbook series in recent years\u201d.",

She made par at the last before letting out a big smile, raising her arms in celebration and hurling her ball into the gallery.</p> <p>Ko finished at 15-under 269, less than four months after claiming her maiden major title at the ANA Inspiration in the California desert. There are five official majors in women\u2019s golf. </p> <p>Ko came from four strokes behind the overnight leader, fellow Korean Kim Hyo-joo, whose hopes disappeared with a triple-bogey at the par-three 14th, where her ball plugged in a greenside bunker.</p> <p>\u201cLast night I thought if I play a really good (final round) I can win,\u201d Ko said before being presented with the trophy by American skier Lindsey Vonn.</p> <p>Kim (73), China\u2019s Shanshan Feng (68) and American Jennifer Kupcho (66) tied for second on 13-under.</p> <p>With her fifth LPGA Tour victory in less than two years, Ko, 24, is projected to reclaim her world number one ranking. There is no secret to Ko\u2019s success other than a flawless swing and a consistency others can only dream of. Apart from her three LPGA wins this year, Ko has also finished runner-up three times, and has never been outside the top 30.</p> <p>\u201cShe plays a mistake-proof game,\u201d said Hall of Fame member Judy Rankin during the Golf Channel telecast.</p> <p>The same said could not be said of overnight leader Kim, who butchered the 14th after finding her ball almost buried in a bunker. She took a hack at the ball, which almost made it on the green, only to roll back down into the bunker, and into one of her large footprints.</p> <p>It was a happier day for Kupcho, who turned pro in May after winning the inaugural Augusta National Women\u2019s Amateur Championship. \u201cI came into the day not expecting to win so to play the way I did, especially on a Sunday, as new as I am out here, it\u2019s pretty exciting,\u201d Kupcho said.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s round was delayed by heavy rain, and the final group did not finish until after 7.30 pm local time. The final group crawled around the back nine in two hours and 47 minutes, but at least they finished, saving the tournament from spilling into Monday.<br>The Evian was the first of back-to-back majors, ahead of the Women\u2019s British Open that will start at Woburn on Thursday. <strong>R</strong><strong>euters</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T20:12:19.066Z\">at 9.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3ddda68f0845f89e315fd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T17:46:21.954Z\">6.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And so Ko Jin-young adds the Evian to this year\u2019s ANA Inspiration.</strong> Her second major of the season was richly deserved, that silky swing standing up to scrutiny when the pressure was cranked up on the back nine. You have to have some sympathy for Kim Hyo-joo, her tee shot plugging right up against the face of the bunker on 14, leading to a triple-bogey punishment that was all out of whack with the crime. Even so, she was always second-best to Ko today. The right woman won. A word of praise too for Shanshan Feng, who shot four sub-70 rounds this week, and Jennifer Kupcho, the US prospect following up her Augusta National amateur win with a second-place finish in a major as a pro. Congratulations to Ko Jin-young, commiserations to Kim Hyo-joo, and thanks to everyone for reading.

And here\u2019s the thin line between success and failure: back on 17, Ko curls in a left-to-right birdie putt! She\u2019s waving her putter in the sky before the ball drops. A perfect putt, perfectly timed in narrative terms.

Kim is just inside her, and really needs to make her putt if she\u2019s to salvage this situation.

Well, guess what. Yep. No prizes.</p> <p><strong>Le Tour hasn\u2019t been the only big sporting event in France to be seriously affected by the weather this week. </strong>The blistering heat of the first two days at the Evian Resort Golf Club in \u00c9vian-les-Bains was fine: only Lexi Thompson got hot under the collar, missing the cut then speaking of her annoyance at watching good drives taking hard bounces off cooked fairways and into trouble. But since then, storms have been an issue, with the field sent out yesterday in threesomes off split tees at seven in the morning to avoid a tempest.</p> <p><strong>That worked out well, with the poor weather only arriving as the final groups finished their rounds. </strong>But there\u2019s been more meteorological bother, with heavy overnight rain flooding fairways and tee boxes. So today the players will again take to the Evian Resort course in threesomes, going off two tees, but this time the play\u2019s been pushed back a couple of hours. The leading pack will be teeing off between 12pm and 1pm BST. But while Le Tour is all over bar the shouting, as the peloton ceremonially trundles into Paris, the 25th edition of the Evian is still very much up in the air, as the 54-hole leaderboard shows:</p> <p><strong><em>-15: </em></strong><em>Kim Hyo-joo<br> <strong>-14:</strong> Park Sung-hyun<br> <strong>-11:</strong> Ko Jin-young, Inbee Park<br> <strong>-10:</strong> Shanshan Feng, Lee Mi-hyang<br> <strong>-9:</strong> Caroline Hedwall<br> <strong>-8:</strong> Ariya Jutanugarn, Megan Khang, Chella Choi</em></p> <p><strong>Plenty of major-winning experience there. </strong>The leader Kim Hyo-joo won the 2014 edition of this tournament, shooting 61 along the way. Park Sung-hyun is the world number one, winner of the 2017 US Open and the 2018 PGA, and nearly snatched this year\u2019s PGA from under the nose of Hannah Green. Inbee Park just needs this title to complete the current five-major set. Ko Jin-young, she of a swing so graceful she makes Freddie Couples look like Jim Furyk, won this year\u2019s ANA. Shanshan Feng won the 2012 PGA. And Ariya Jutanugarn has both US and British Opens on her resume. In conclusion: it\u2019s on! A bit later than anticipated, perhaps, but on.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T10:21:30.088Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Ko Jin-young won the Evian Championship by two strokes in France on Sunday, cementing her reputation as a player for big occasions with her second major victory of the year. The South Korean seized control with a 15-foot birdie at the penultimate hole, where she perfectly read a sharply-breaking putt at the Evian Resort in Evian-les-Bains. She made par at the last before letting out a big smile, raising her arms in celebration and hurling her ball into the gallery. Ko finished at 15-under 269, less than four months after claiming her maiden major title at the ANA Inspiration in the California desert. There are five official majors in women\u2019s golf. Ko came from four strokes behind the overnight leader, fellow Korean Kim Hyo-joo, whose hopes disappeared with a triple-bogey at the par-three 14th, where her ball plugged in a greenside bunker. \u201cLast night I thought if I play a really good (final round) I can win,\u201d Ko said before being presented with the trophy by American skier Lindsey Vonn. Kim (73), China\u2019s Shanshan Feng (68) and American Jennifer Kupcho (66) tied for second on 13-under. With her fifth LPGA Tour victory in less than two years, Ko, 24, is projected to reclaim her world number one ranking. There is no secret to Ko\u2019s success other than a flawless swing and a consistency others can only dream of. Apart from her three LPGA wins this year, Ko has also finished runner-up three times, and has never been outside the top 30. \u201cShe plays a mistake-proof game,\u201d said Hall of Fame member Judy Rankin during the Golf Channel telecast. The same said could not be said of overnight leader Kim, who butchered the 14th after finding her ball almost buried in a bunker. She took a hack at the ball, which almost made it on the green, only to roll back down into the bunker, and into one of her large footprints. It was a happier day for Kupcho, who turned pro in May after winning the inaugural Augusta National Women\u2019s Amateur Championship. \u201cI came into the day not expecting to win so to play the way I did, especially on a Sunday, as new as I am out here, it\u2019s pretty exciting,\u201d Kupcho said. Sunday\u2019s round was delayed by heavy rain, and the final group did not finish until after 7.30 pm local time. The final group crawled around the back nine in two hours and 47 minutes, but at least they finished, saving the tournament from spilling into Monday. The Evian was the first of back-to-back majors, ahead of the Women\u2019s British Open that will start at Woburn on Thursday. Reuters And so Ko Jin-young adds the Evian to this year\u2019s ANA Inspiration. Her second major of the season was richly deserved, that silky swing standing up to scrutiny when the pressure was cranked up on the back nine. You have to have some sympathy for Kim Hyo-joo, her tee shot plugging right up against the face of the bunker on 14, leading to a triple-bogey punishment that was all out of whack with the crime. Even so, she was always second-best to Ko today. The right woman won. A word of praise too for Shanshan Feng, who shot four sub-70 rounds this week, and Jennifer Kupcho, the US prospect following up her Augusta National amateur win with a second-place finish in a major as a pro. Congratulations to Ko Jin-young, commiserations to Kim Hyo-joo, and thanks to everyone for reading. Hope to see you next week for all four days of the British Open! -15: Ko -13: Kupcho, Feng, Kim -11: A Jutanugarn -10: M Jutanugarn, S Park -9: Khang, I Park -8: Ciganda The brilliant 24-year-old South Korean tidies up for par, and she\u2019s the deserved winner of the Evian! A 67 to finish, a quite brilliant round of golf on a day when her closest competitors capitulated. -15: Ko -13: Kupcho, Feng, Kim Ko has been made to wait quite a while. Park wedges out to five feet. Ko then gets her chance to putt. She rolls her birdie effort four feet past. Kim knocks her birdie putt in for a 73. She\u2019s -13 and will have a share of second place. She\u2019ll be ruing that tee shot on 14. Park then sends her par putt three feet past. Bogey, a miserable 75, and she ends the week at -10, tied for sixth. The fiasco of the 18th hole was her round in microcosm. A farcical end to Park\u2019s round. She\u2019s squatting on a rock in the middle of the flower bed, wondering what the situation with a loose impediment is. She\u2019s allowed to move it without penalty. Then she bashes out of the flowers, Caddyshack style, over the green and into the deep rough on the other side. Not bad given she was still balancing on that rock. Ko does what she needs to do. A wedge into the heart of the green from 100 yards. She\u2019s not particularly close, 30 feet away perhaps, but then she\u2019ll have three putts for victory! Kim, the pressure off, wedges to six feet. Ko and Kim lay up with their second shots. Park Sung-hyun decides to go for it, taking out the fairway wood, and sends a huge slice into the flower arrangement to the right of the green. That might even have bounced a little further, in which case it\u2019s out of bounds. But we\u2019ll see. Either way, it\u2019s a denouement in keeping with her dismal final round. Up on the green, Inbee Park pars to sign for a very disappointing 73. Like her namesake Sung-hyun, she wasn\u2019t at the races today. She ends the week at -9, yet again tied for eighth, equalling her best finish in this event, a result she achieved in 2015 and 2018. The super grand slam still eludes her. One of the most important tee shots of Ko Jin-young\u2019s life coming up. She plays it safe with a 3-wood ... and that sensationally smooth swing doesn\u2019t let her down. Down the fairway. Two careful shots to the green, and this is all over! Fine drives by Kim and Park, too, as they realistically look for the final birdies that\u2019ll improve their position. Feng wedges into the last. It\u2019s decent, nothing more, and she\u2019s left with a 20-footer for a closing birdie. Her putt is a fine effort, gently oscillating this way and that. But it somehow stops on the right lip. It\u2019s a fine 66, and that\u2019s a share of the clubhouse lead with Kupcho. And here\u2019s the thin line between success and failure: back on 17, Ko curls in a left-to-right birdie putt! She\u2019s waving her putter in the sky before the ball drops. A perfect putt, perfectly timed in narrative terms. As Kim and Park par, she walks off to the 18th tee with a two-shot lead. -15: Ko (17) -13: Kupcho (F), Feng (F) -12: Kim (17) -11: A Jutanugarn (F), S Park (17) Ko sends her second at 17 over the flag. She\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet coming back. That\u2019s decent enough, given the state of play, and she shares a laugh and a joke with her caddie. Kim is just inside her, and really needs to make her putt if she\u2019s to salvage this situation. Park\u2019s approach is down a swale to the left; every time she\u2019s taken a step forward today, she slides straight back. Ko, Kim and Park all bash their tee shots at 17 straight down the middle. Up on 18, Feng lays up with her second. This is coming rather deliciously to the boil. Feng\u2019s drive at 18 is arrowed down the middle. Exactly what\u2019s required. Back on 16, the leader Ko knocks her tee shot over the flag to 12 feet, but the left-to-right birdie putt\u2019s never dropping. Par for Kim. And birdie for Park Sung-hyun, whose world-number-one-style tee shot lands 12 feet to the right of the flag, kicks left off the bank, and stops three feet from the hole. She\u2019s not quite out of it yet! This final round took quite a while to ignite - blame the incessant rain - but my word what a finish we have here! So many possibilities! -14: Ko (16) -13: Kupcho (F), Feng (17) -12: Kim (16) -11: A Jutanugarn (F), S Park (16) It was a strong finish by Moriya Jutanugarn. Birdies at 16 and 18, the latter reward for a wedge sent to kick-in distance. She signs for a 68 and ends the week at -10. Then eagle for her sister Ariya, coming up behind, and she\u2019s shot 68 as well, finishing a shot better off at -11. Meanwhile on 17, Shanshan Feng isn\u2019t finished: she fizzes her second shot to 15 feet, and guides in the left-to-right curler for birdie! She\u2019s just a shot off the lead at -13, and with the relatively easy par-five 18th to come! No bounce-back birdie for Kim on 15. She nearly curls in a big right-to-left breaker from the fringe, but par will have to do, and her head drops a little. Park duffs a chip from the side of the green, and then hits the flagstick again with another overcooked wedge. This one doesn\u2019t drop, but the tap-in that\u2019s left limits the damage to bogey. She\u2019s -10. And finally Ko\u2019s birdie putt slips by. Par. -14: Ko (15) -13: Kupcho (F) -12: Feng (16), Kim (15) -10: M Jutanugarn (F), S Park (15) Jennifer Kupcho tidies up for her birdie on 18! That\u2019s three birdies in the last four holes, and he\u2019s one off the lead. A magnificent 66 of carpe-diem brilliance from the Augusta National amateur champion! -14: Ko (14) -13: Kupcho (F) -12: Feng (16), Kim (14) Kupcho chips up from the bank. Her ball bounds ten feet past the hole, but stops softly and then is gathered back towards the cup by the camber of the green. She\u2019ll have a five-footer to make that birdie. Though up on 15, Ko takes three careful shots down the middle of the par five, and she\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 12 feet. It might be enough to seal the deal. Jennifer Kupcho has clearly decided that she\u2019s not going to leave \u00c9vian-les-Bains wondering. Out comes the fairway wood at 18. She\u2019s going for it, over the creek. And she only just makes it, the ball snagging on the bank on the other side. That was a yard away from a watery grave. You\u2019ve got to admire her style. Up and down for birdie, and she\u2019ll be signing for her second 66 of the week ... and setting a clubhouse lead of -13. If she can make it, she\u2019ll be posing the leader Ko Jim-young a question. Kim was two shots clear not very long ago. Now she\u2019s two behind. How on earth will she respond to the dramatic events on 14? Her tee shot back there wasn\u2019t great, but even so, plugging right up against the face was outrageously bad luck. Consider the fortune of Sung-hyun Park, whose tee shot was no better, and whose bunker shot was really travelling. It sounds ridiculous, but it really is a thin line between birdie and triple bogey. Golf, right there, in a nutshell. Kim putts from the fringe and nearly sinks an outrageous bogey putt, the ball slithering this way and that over a couple of humps. But it rolls six feet past, and she can\u2019t make the one coming back. A triple bogey. Meanwhile Ko lags a wonder putt from 70 feet to kick-in distance. Par, and she\u2019s suddenly two shots in the lead! And if that\u2019s not enough drama, up on 17, Kupcho sends her tee shot down the right, forcing her to go over some trees if she wants to reach the green. A sensational wedge over lands on the fringe, and she rattles in a 25-footer for her fourth birdie of the day! All of a sudden, everything\u2019s changed. Major-championship golf, folks, right here! -14: Ko (14) -12: Kupcho (17), Feng (15), Kim (14) -11: S Park (14) Less than half of Kim\u2019s ball is visible. She does extremely well to blast it straight into the air, avoiding the face. But it lands on the bank and topples back in. Adding insult to injury, it lands in her deep footprint. That\u2019s awful luck. But instead of bemoaning her luck, she quickly gets back to work, and splashes out before the situation overwhelms her. It\u2019s a fine escape, though her ball only just reaches the fringe. Kim\u2019s lie: it\u2019s a horror show. Plugged, right under the lip. Before she can work out what to do, Park - also in the bunker - whips a hot one out. The ball would have flown miles past the flag, perhaps off the other side of the green ... had it not hit the flagstick and dropped into the cup! An outrageous birdie that brings her back to -11. And with Kim in all sorts of bother, she\u2019s no longer out of this! Ko takes 6-iron on the par-three 14th. Not enough club, though it finds the front of the long, deep green. Kim sends her hybrid into the deep bunker to the right of the dancefloor. Advantage Ko, just about, though much will depend on Kim\u2019s lie. Ko Jin-young makes a move on 13! She sinks a long right-to-left swinger for a birdie out of nowhere, and the gap is down to one again. Pars for the leader Kim Hyo-joo and Park Sung-hyun. And Jennifer Kupcho gets out of 16 with a par, lagging her long birdie putt to the cup and tidying up. -15: Kim (13) -14: Ko (13) -12: Feng (14) -11: Kupcho (16) Kupcho plays the game with a smile. She wedges her tee shot into the heart of the short par-three 16th. The ball screws back violently and nearly topples into the lake, but is held up by the fringe. So nearly a fine shot; so nearly a disaster. But the young American simply laughs casually. Still, that\u2019ll be a tricky two putts for par, up against the fringe. Jennifer Kupcho is the real deal. She\u2019s had a year to remember already, winning the inaugural Augusta Women\u2019s Amateur title, and turning professional. But now she\u2019s threatening to win her first major in only her eighth start as a pro! Birdie at 15 now, her third of the day, the rest pars. She\u2019s four back at -11, but remember there\u2019s an eagle chance at the 18th. And if the leaders wobble ... well, what a story this would be. Whatever happens, though, she\u2019s announced herself as a real talent. The start of a late surge by Inbee Park? It\u2019s almost certainly too late, but having birdied 11, she drains a monster right-to-left curler on 13 to move up to -9. Hopes of a first Evian Championship for the seven-time major winner aren\u2019t quite extinguished yet, but she\u2019ll need a superb finish, and hope that Kim Hyo-joo and Ko Young-jin both collapse ignominiously. Park\u2019s par putt at 12 is never dropping, and there goes yet another shot. The world number one is four over for her round today. Quite a contrast to her first three rounds of 67, 66 and 66. She really doesn\u2019t like wet and cold conditions. Not that her partners do any better on the hole, which is playing as the hardest today. Both miss their par savers, and there\u2019s a bit of backslide at the top of the leaderboard. -15: Kim (12) -13: Ko (12) -12: Feng (12) -10: Kupcho (14), S Park (12) -9: A Jutanugarn (13) Kim\u2019s splash from sand is tentative, and only just creeps over the face and out. Her ball rolls apologetically onto the fringe. Ko clips crisply to eight feet, not good, not bad from where she was, down the bank in tousled nonsense. But Park, just off the side, chunks her chip. She\u2019s left with a 20-footer coming back. The former US Open and PGA winner is way off her game today. Kim\u2019s second into 12 takes a huge kick left and bounds into a greenside bunker. The door\u2019s ajar for Ko, but her second lands hard on the green and sails long and left. She\u2019s worried it\u2019s gone out of bounds, but it\u2019s OK, in so much as it\u2019s in the filthy rough. Park follows her in. All three with work to do for their pars. Ariya Jutanugarn has been quite the entertainer around the turn. Birdies at 8 and 9, bogey at 10, birdie at 11, and now bogey at 12. She\u2019s -9. Meanwhile Shanshan Feng, having turned in 32, bogeyed 10 and lipped out for birdie on 11; she\u2019s four back at -12. Park Sung-hyun can\u2019t say she hasn\u2019t had the breaks today. Her second shot into the trees was abysmal, but her ball rebounds out of the forest and lands in the semi-rough again. And there\u2019s a route into the green. She wedges a delightful third to 12 feet - the cream always rises - but her flat stick is stone cold. Her chance of saving an unlikely par trundles three feet past, then she yips the one coming back. A double-bogey six, and with the leader Kim making her birdie putt - Ko settles for par - the world number-one looks a beaten docket today. -16: Kim (11) -14: Ko (11) -12: Feng (11) -11: S Park (11) It could be the end of Park Sung-hyun\u2019s bid, too. Her driving has been off all day, and on 11 she sends a big hook into the trees. She gets a member\u2019s bounce back into the semi-rough, but she\u2019s lost a lot of yardage. So out comes too much club. Not enough loft to get over the trees at the side of the gentle dogleg left. She fires her ball low and left, straight into the branches and more trouble. Meanwhile Kim and Ko both wedge their second shots to 12 feet, setting up good looks at birdie. There could be some significant separation at the top soon. Moriya Jutanugarn\u2019s race is run. A double bogey at 12 after finding herself plugged in a bunker by the green. She slips to -8. She\u2019s alongside Carlota Ciganda, whose consistency in the majors, without reward, is almost Rickie Fowleresque. She\u2019s got the game to become Spain\u2019s first major winner. Perhaps next week at Woburn. But it won\u2019t be today. Still, birdies at 10 and 13 have lifted her up the standings. Shot of the day, perhaps the entire week, by Ko Jin-young at 10! The reigning ANA champ whips a wedge from 140 yards to a matter of inches, the ball nearly slam-dunking straight into the cup, bouncing a second time right next to the pin, and landing a foot past. She\u2019ll tap that in to move to within a shot of the leader! Ko is the only player in the final group under par. She\u2019s the one who looks like seizing the day, because that was simply sensational! Pars meanwhile for Sung-hyun Park and Kim, and this is becoming very interesting now. -15: Kim (10) -14: Ko (10) -13: S Park (10) It\u2019s taken the last group two hours and 48 minutes to complete the front nine. The conditions, the threesomes, and the lift, clean and place rules haven\u2019t helped. But it\u2019s been slow nonetheless. An awful lot of time being taken over some very short putts, to no apparent benefit in terms of quality. You have to wonder whether professionals across the board would be better served taking these short ones quickly, without too much thought, like Darren Clarke used to do. Park Sung-hyun\u2019s speed-to-result ratio today has been particularly poor. Brooks Koepka speaks for the HBH report on this topic. Kim pulls her putt to the left. Par. Ko then prods with great uncertainty at her shorter effort, and it dribbles away to the right. And finally Park tugs her one left. Nobody will be particularly happy with that miserable collection of putts, though in the context of the tournament that\u2019s a huge let-off for the leader Kim, who remains two in front. -15: Kim (9) -13: Feng (9), Ko (9), S Park (9) -10: Kupcho (10), M Jutanugarn (10) Ariya Jutanugarn sends a woeful chip whistling up the bank at 10 and miles past the hole. That was really heavy handed, and the resulting bogey might have cost her an outside chance of the title. She slips back to -9. Meanwhile back on the par-five 9th, Ko finds herself just off the front in two, and nearly chips in for eagle. But it rolls six feet past. Park Sung-hyun is also just off in two, but her chip up checks and stops six feet short. Neither birdie effort left is a gimme. With Kim looking at birdie from 12 feet, this is a big couple of minutes coming up! The rain\u2019s getting heavier. So much for the conditions improving during the afternoon. Birdie for Moriya Jutanugarn on 10; she\u2019s keeping on her sister Ariya\u2019s tail. They\u2019re both -10 now. And Shanshan Feng gets up and down from the front of 9, hitting the turn in 32! Two off the lead at -13, she\u2019s right in this tournament now ... unlike her partners Lee (-6) and Inbee Park (-8) who have gone out in 39 and 38 respectively. -15: Kim (8) -13: Feng (9), Ko (8), S Park (8) -10: Kupcho (10), M Jutanugarn (10), A Jutanugarn (9) -8: I Park (9), Khang (9) Birdie for Ariya Jutanugarn at 9. She\u2019s -10. Megan Khang tries her best to miss a four-footer at the same hole after a glorious approach, but the hole snaffles the ball just in time. After a dropped stroke at 7, she\u2019s back to -8. The leader Kim Hyo-joo makes her first birdie of the day ... and in what style! Her tee shot into the par-three 8th isn\u2019t all that. She\u2019s 40 feet from the flag. But she rolls in a gentle right-to-left slider, perfectly paced to tease the crowd as it threatens to stop a turn short before falling gently into the cup. She rises her putter into the air like Nicklaus at Augusta in \u201886, and allows a smile to briefly tickle at the corners of her mouth. She fights it, but the cat\u2019s out of the bag, and that\u2019ll have settled her after a nondescript start. And the rake spooks her opponents, because SH Park and Ko both miss ten-footers for birdie. What a momentum shifter! -15: Kim (8) -13: Ko (8), SH Park (8) -12: Feng (8) Moriya Jutanugarn screeches a gorgeous chip to kick-in distance at 9. A birdie that takes her up to -9, cancelling out the bogey she\u2019d made at 7. Her playing partner Jennifer Kupcho meanwhile splashes from sand to four feet, but pulls a nervous birdie putt left. That\u2019s a punch to the guts right at the end of a fine front nine. She still turns in 33, but needs every shot if she\u2019s to add a professional major to her Augusta National amateur title. -14: Kim (7) -13: SH Park (7), Ko (7) -12: Feng (8) -10: Kupcho (9) -9: M Jutanugarn (9), A Jutanugarn (8) -8: I Park (8) The leader Kim is short of the par-five 7th in three. She could do with another of her trademark scrambles here. But her chip in is weak, stopping 12 feet short of the cup. The next putt is huge, because both of the other players in this final group have birdie putts just inside her. In it goes! That ensures she retains her lead, because SH Park makes her birdie to move to within one again. -14: Kim (7) -13: SH Park (7), Ko (7) -12: Feng (8) The two-time major winner Ariya Jutanugarn breaks a run of pars with birdie at 8. She\u2019s keeping herself within touching distance at -9. Meanwhile a word on Lee Mi-hyang, the runner-up at this year\u2019s ANA. Her round has gone from bad to worse since that double at 3; bogeys at 4, 5 and 6 have crashed her all the way down the leaderboard to -5. Missing a short birdie putt at the par-five 7th won\u2019t have improved her mood. Another year to wait for a major breakthrough that\u2019s surely got to come for the 26-year-old South Korean. This is golf, and even seven-time major winners can struggle. Inbee Park just needs this tournament to become only the second player, after Karrie Webb, to complete a five-major Super Grand Slam. (She\u2019s already got a career Grand Slam to her name, for winning the other four, as per LPGA policy, the Evian only having been a fifth major since 2013.) It doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019ll complete the set today, sadly. Her tee shot at 7 is tugged into rough down the right; the second is a full-blown slice. Her third goes straight left into a deep bunker at the front of the green. She can\u2019t get up and down, and that\u2019s her third bogey of the day. She\u2019s -8 and though she\u2019s only six behind, her game doesn\u2019t look in any sort of shape for a challenge. The reigning ANA champion Ko Jin-young has been going along smoothly. Five pars to open. But now she strokes in a 20-footer for birdie at 6 to move within two strokes of the lead. Up on 8, Kupcho, competing in only her eighth tournament as a professional, clips her tee shot to six feet and knocks in the putt. This is heating up rather nicely, despite the state of the weather! -14: Kim (6) -12: Feng (6), Ko (6), SH Park (6) -10: Kupcho (8) -9: I Park (6) Meanwhile on 6, Feng looks utterly disgusted with herself upon sending her second shot into the green. But her ball screeches to a halt three feet from the flag. A lucky break? Or maybe she was just moaning about the weather, which would be fair enough. It\u2019s rank. In goes the birdie putt, and the 2012 PGA champ is right in the mix now, currently on course to better her third-place finish here in 2015 ... and surely now entertaining thoughts of a second major title. She looks relaxed out there - the histrionics back up the fairway aside - unlike a few of her competitors. -14: Kim (5) -12: Feng (6), SH Park (5) -11: Ko (5) Kim nearly drains a monster for birdie across 5. A tap-in for par. Par for Ko as well. But it\u2019s a third bogey of the day for the world number one SH Park, who races her birdie putt six feet past, then pulls the one coming back, the ball lipping out. She looks highly uncomfortable in her rain gear, tucking various hanging bits under her arms as she addresses her putts. None of this augurs well for the rest of the round, because this weather isn\u2019t going away. The rain is coming down in stair-rods now. All three members of the final group find the par-three 5th with their tee shots, though the leader Kim tugs her effort miles left of the flag. She\u2019s lucky the green is so big. SH Park meanwhile suffers some bad luck for once: she fires an iron straight at the flag. A couple of feet further, and it would have rolled extremely close indeed. But her ball careers off a downslope and rattles 15 feet past. Still a birdie chance, but it deserved so much more. Inbee Park is hanging on by her fingernails. Her tee shot at the par-three 5th comes up short. But she does extremely well to get up and down from sand, avoiding the ignominy of three bogeys on the bounce. She remains at -9. With the rain getting heavier and the wind rising, the South Korean superstar\u2019s hopes of landing the one major to elude her aren\u2019t over yet. \u201cFantastic leaderboard,\u201d writes Lucy Wesson. \u201cWith this weather, anything is possible. And you have the Jutanugarns and two solid Americans looking for their first titles (Kupcho and one of my favorites, Khang) ready to pounce! Great tournament! And I will be here with bells on for the women\u2019s Open Championship next weekend, unless wearing bells is frowned upon round these parts.\u201d They force me to sit in the corner of the office in a jester\u2019s hat, so I think you\u2019ll be fine. Two putts for SH Park. A par she\u2019d have grabbed with both hands when her drive was arcing towards bother. She can\u2019t keep getting away with those wild tee shots, though. At some point, she\u2019ll cop a bad lie. Ko ends up with her fourth par in four holes. And finally Kim, who is an inch\u2019s worth of energy away from guiding in a left-to-right curler, but has to settle for par as well. It\u2019s as you were at the top. SH Park\u2019s third drive of the day, and yet again it\u2019s pulled left. And for the third time, she gets the benefit of a break, her ball stopping one bounce short of the really thick stuff. She\u2019s able to hoick her second into the heart of the green, though that\u2019s two-putt territory. Her partners Kim and Ko are also on in regulation, with half-chances for birdie from 15 feet or so. Meanwhile another birdie for Moriya Jutanugarn, at 6, and she rises to -9. The former world number-one Shanshan Feng clips her second at 4 to eight feet. That\u2019s beautifully controlled, and she knocks in the putt for birdie. She moves to -11, but it\u2019s back-to-back bogeys for her playing partner Inbee Park, who pays the price after completely mishitting her second, a low hook into some mutant cabbage down the left. At the moment, this looks like a four-way fight. Mind you, there\u2019s an awfully long way to go, and it\u2019s raining again to boot. -14: Kim (3) -13: SH Park (3) -11: Feng (4), Ko (3) -9: Kupcho (5), I Park (4) -8: A Jutanugarn (5), M Jutanugarn (5), Khang (5) A break for SH Park, who once again finds her ball sitting up in the rough after a wild drive. It allows her to swish a lovely lob wedge into the heart of the green, setting up a birdie chance from 15 feet. And in it goes! Not so much luck for the leader Kim, whose drive was heading for a bunker but caught in the rough just in front. She\u2019s forced to play her second standing down in the sand, her ball well above her feet. But she nearly reaches the green anyway, manufacturing a lovely approach that sends her ball to the fringe. But she can\u2019t get up and down, and suddenly the lead is back to one. It\u2019s three pars in a row for Ko, meanwhile, and she\u2019s just three off the pace at -11. And birdie for Moriya Jutanugarn on 4. She joins her younger sister Ariya at -8. -14: Kim (3) -13: SH Park (3) -11: Ko (3) -10: Feng (3), I Park (3) -9: Kupcho (5) Bogey for Inbee Park at 3, the result of a miserable approach pulled into thick filth down the left. She\u2019s -10. Meanwhile her playing partner Lee Mi-hyang doubles, having zig-zagged her way down the hole. She\u2019s -8, her chances severely compromised now. Back on the tee, Park Sung-hyun sends another drive into the rough on the left. That\u2019s two out of two. She looks a little restricted in her rain gear, her swing not in sync. She\u2019s spoken before of her dislike for playing in wet, cold conditions, and yesterday evening\u2019s quotes - \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is going to change with the weather, I have played in the rain a lot of times, so I will focus on my game\u201d - smacked of a player protesting too much. It\u2019s a bogey-bogey start for Park. The world number one races a long birdie effort at the par-three 2nd 15 feet past the hole. She can\u2019t make the saver coming back, and suddenly Kim, who along with Ko makes a fuss-free two-putt par, has a healthy lead at the top. -15: Kim (2) -12: SH Park (2) -11: I Park (2), Ko (2) Caroline Hedwall shot a fantastic 64 on Friday, but the climate\u2019s closing in on the 30-year-old Swede today. Bogeys at 1 and 3, and her slim chance of victory is gone. She clatters back down to -7. She\u2019s slipped down the rankings to 11th a result, and her second top-ten career finish in a major (the first being a tie for third at the 2013 ANA) is suddenly in jeopardy. \u201cThank you for the live blog coverage of the LPGA Evian Championship,\u201d begins Lucy Wesson. \u201cAs a woman golfer, I love finding good coverage of these events. And I love the random Orson Welles commercials - awesome call backs! Cheers from America while I\u2019m having my morning coffee.\u201d And it\u2019s just a few hours until you can crack open one of Paul Masson\u2019s famous Californian carafes. By the way, we\u2019ll be covering all four days of the British Open live, so hopefully we\u2019ll see you again later this week for that. The aforementioned Mirim Lee is the only player within nine shots of the lead to be under par for her round so far. The chasing pack are static. Pars for Shanshan Feng, Lee Mi-hyang and super-slam-chasing Inbee Park at 2. Ah but here we go! Jennifer Kupcho, who at 22 has already made an indelible mark on the sport by winning the inaugural Augusta National Women\u2019s Amateur this year, birdies 3 to rise to -9. A lovely second shot pin high to eight feet. She wanders off smiling broadly, despite the rain coming down again. Kim is the leader in scrambling on the LPGA Tour, and she displays her greenside smarts by sending a crisp chip up the bank to a couple of feet. Par. Park\u2019s effort from a similar position is poor, however, an uncertain jab that checks the second it lands on the front of the green. She\u2019s left with a 12-footer for par. It\u2019s always missing on the right. That\u2019s a poor opening bogey. Ko meanwhile lags up from distance and tidies up for par. The leader\u2019s cushion at the top is now two. -15: Kim (1) -13: SH Park (1) -11: I Park (1), Ko (1) -10: Lee (1), Feng (1) Kim\u2019s ball is sitting up in the rough. She\u2019s able to fire a low iron towards the green, and there her luck runs out: instead of creeping onto the front, close to the flag, her ball breaks left and down a swale. That was one turn away from perfection. It\u2019s a thin line. Ko is on in regulation, though not particularly close. Finally it\u2019s the turn of Park, who takes up a huge divot and comes up well short of the green. The importance of finding the fairway and avoiding the damp rough, illustrated perfectly right here. The final group are out and about! And it\u2019s not an ideal start for the leader Kim Hyo-joo, whose opening drive finds the thick, wet rough down the left. The world number one Park Sung-hyun\u2019s first tee shot just creeps in there too, narrowly avoiding a large bunker. The third South Korean in the group, Ko Jin-young, finds the middle of the fairway. But her ball thunks to an immediate stop, evidence that there won\u2019t be much run this afternoon. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen Orson\u2019s other wine commercial, right?\u201d Our old pal Tom Lutz, there, practically begging me to post this fine clip of a master at work. Action is imminent, I feel it necessary to add. The early signs suggest low scores will come at a premium this afternoon. Of the early starters, many more players are over par for their rounds than under it. Yu Liu, Choi Hye-jin, Hsu Wei-ling and Caroline Masson are all three over already today, and none of them have played more than five holes. Amy Olson is four over through 4. Today could prove a battle. Enough to drive anyone to drink. Umbrellas are up again on the shores of Lake Geneva. Nothing too dramatic, and the rain\u2019s expected to ease off as the afternoon progresses. Expect the players to attack a few of the pins, the greens being so soft and receptive. On the other hand, the fairways are still a bit sodden, so the course will be playing a little longer. Pick-and-place rules are in effect. Nobody from the pack is making an early run, the sole exception being Mirim Lee, with back-to-back birdies at 2 and 3. She\u2019s -6. The leaders will be out soon enough, and then we\u2019ll really get going. Guardian fake news dept. Turns out the last entry shouldn\u2019t be time-stamped 11.33am, but misinformation o\u2019clock. It\u2019s the coverage that won\u2019t be kicking in for an hour or so. In fact, the early groups have taken to the course already, with the sky looking considerably brighter. Nothing of note to report yet, other than Jing Yan\u2019s entertaining start to the round: birdie, triple bogey, birdie. She\u2019s level par for the tournament. Significant news when we have it. You\u2019ve still got time to nip out for the Observer and 20 Bensons, if we\u2019re being honest. The course has taken a real hammering, and the start has been further delayed. The greenkeeping staff are doing their best to drain the waterlogged tees, fairways and greens, but it\u2019s a big ask. Still, here\u2019s some good news: conditions are improving, and they hope to get proceedings underway in the next 60 to 90 minutes. When they snap into action, so shall we. When the LPGA awarded the Evian Championship major status back in 2013, the tournament was moved from July to September. Cue rain and wind affecting proceedings, to such an extent that organisers shifted it back this year to July. Well, guess what. Yep. No prizes. Le Tour hasn\u2019t been the only big sporting event in France to be seriously affected by the weather this week. The blistering heat of the first two days at the Evian Resort Golf Club in \u00c9vian-les-Bains was fine: only Lexi Thompson got hot under the collar, missing the cut then speaking of her annoyance at watching good drives taking hard bounces off cooked fairways and into trouble. But since then, storms have been an issue, with the field sent out yesterday in threesomes off split tees at seven in the morning to avoid a tempest. That worked out well, with the poor weather only arriving as the final groups finished their rounds. But there\u2019s been more meteorological bother, with heavy overnight rain flooding fairways and tee boxes. So today the players will again take to the Evian Resort course in threesomes, going off two tees, but this time the play\u2019s been pushed back a couple of hours. The leading pack will be teeing off between 12pm and 1pm BST. But while Le Tour is all over bar the shouting, as the peloton ceremonially trundles into Paris, the 25th edition of the Evian is still very much up in the air, as the 54-hole leaderboard shows: -15: Kim Hyo-joo -14: Park Sung-hyun -11: Ko Jin-young, Inbee Park -10: Shanshan Feng, Lee Mi-hyang -9: Caroline Hedwall -8: Ariya Jutanugarn, Megan Khang, Chella Choi Plenty of major-winning experience there. The leader Kim Hyo-joo won the 2014 edition of this tournament, shooting 61 along the way. Park Sung-hyun is the world number one, winner of the 2017 US Open and the 2018 PGA, and nearly snatched this year\u2019s PGA from under the nose of Hannah Green. Inbee Park just needs this title to complete the current five-major set. Ko Jin-young, she of a swing so graceful she makes Freddie Couples look like Jim Furyk, won this year\u2019s ANA. Shanshan Feng won the 2012 PGA. And Ariya Jutanugarn has both US and British Opens on her resume. In conclusion: it\u2019s on! A bit later than anticipated, perhaps, but on.",

Allies of Corbyn say he is very prepared for an election after facing his third Tory prime minister in Johnson and having moved Labour\u2019s Brexit position to a clear commitment to a second referendum. However, some Labour MPs are increasingly worried about the threat of the Liberal Democrats being more unequivocally committed to remaining in the EU if there is a quick election called by Johnson to win a mandate for taking the UK out by 31 October. Neil Coyle, a Labour MP in Bermondsey and Old Southwark, a former Lib Dem seat, highlighted a Mail on Sunday/Deltapoll survey suggesting Labour would do better against Johnson without Corbyn as leader. \u201cLabour member?

Labour shied away from calling a vote on Johnson just before parliament broke up for the summer, because Conservative rebels wanted to give the new prime minister a chance to come up with a plan to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But with Johnson ramping up no-deal preparations, speculation about the likelihood of an election is increasing. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, branded Labour\u2019s position \u201chopeless\u201d and said she would provide the \u201creal opposition\u201d to Johnson by opposing leaving the EU in all circumstances.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s best chance of winning an Ashes series in England since 2001 lies in the hands of their bowlers. It is Josh Hazlewood, though, rather than Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc or James Pattinson who perhaps will play the most significant role once the first Test starts at Edgbaston on Thursday. The 28-year-old is more of a craftsman than a speed merchant, the most skilful bowler in a squad containing six seamers, but one still capable of breaking 90mph. Hazlewood was left out of Australia\u2019s World Cup squad following a serious back injury sustained in January. He could have played in the tournament but was rested specifically for the Ashes. To say he is ready to get stuck into England\u2019s fragile batting lineup would be an understatement. Good news for Australia. Bad news for Jason Roy, for whom Thursday will mark the opener\u2019s second Test appearance following his debut against Ireland at Lord\u2019s. Hazlewood was at pains to point out he has specific plans for a batsman who terrorised Australia\u2019s bowlers during the World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston, Roy scoring 85 in 65 balls as England eased to an emphatic victory. The Surrey batsman was less dynamic against Ireland, dismissed for five in a first innings where England were bowled out for 85 before scoring 72 in the second. That knock showed promise but it came from No 3 after Roy opted for a nightwatchman in Jack Leach late on the first day. Even then Leach outshone the 29-year-old \u2013 and every other England batsman \u2013 by top-scoring with 92. Edgbaston and Australia will be a completely different prospect for a batsman who has spent the majority of his first-class career in the middle-order. Hazlewood knows it and he has a specific plan for Roy. \u201cHe\u2019s only played one Test match and it\u2019s a lot different opening the batting in a Test than a one-day game, that\u2019s for sure. In England opening is probably the toughest place to bat. We\u2019ll see how he goes in Test cricket.\u201d Aaron Finch, Australia\u2019s one-day captain who, like Roy, is one of the best one-day openers in the world, played five Tests last year but will not be involved in the Ashes after struggling to cope in cricket\u2019s longest format. \u201cFinchy found it a big step up,\u201d Hazlewood said. \u201cHe found the ball swung and seamed around and the wickets were a lot different to a one-day wicket. To play attacking cricket in those conditions is tough. \u201cHe\u2019d played a lot of his four-day cricket at five or six and I think Roy is the same at Surrey.

Section 10 of the act states that nothing in it may \u201cdiminish any form of north-south co-operation provided for by the Belfast agreement\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnston repeats ad nauseam that the Irish backstop is unacceptable and that he is willing to leave the EU without a deal (Brussels rejects Johnson\u2019s plans for a new Brexit deal over summer, 26 July). Clearly he has not taken account of the EU Withdrawal Act 2018, which paves the way for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and is the law of the land. Section 10 of the act states that nothing in it may \u201cdiminish any form of north-south co-operation provided for by the Belfast agreement\u201d. An official mapping exercise identified well over 100 areas of north-south cooperation, many of which relate to the operation of the north-south ministerial council established under the Belfast agreement. Removal of the backstop, or a no-deal Brexit, would be unlawful under the act. I appreciate that breaking the law would be a mere bagatelle to this prime minister but I look forward to finding out precisely how he intends to do it. Mike Pender Cardiff \u2022 Boris Johnson and his shadowy advisers long ago war-gamed all options for this autumn. The most likely outcomes are: losing his majority; failing to get an agreement with the EU; and parliament blocking no deal. Thus he ends up looking weak. So, his strategy is to say he will rule out calling a snap election, while making impossible demands on Europe, so that he can claim to be forced into an election, to protect this plucky little nation facing an overbearing enemy (Johnson sets UK on collision course with EU over backstop, 27 July). A khaki election without a war. We\u2019ve rumbled you, Mr Johnson. Dr Nigel Mellor Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 In July 2018, Donald Trump heaped praise on Theresa May, calling her an \u201cincredible woman\u201d. This tribute followed a shocking interview with the Sun, in which he slammed her Brexit strategy, arguing that it threatened a UK-US trade deal \u2013 the perfect example of this president\u2019s erratic nature guided by self-interest and narcissism. As Johnson and Trump embark on their honeymoon, let us recognise this love-in for what it is: temporary. Trump has repeatedly called for a trade deal with \u201cunlimited potential\u201d, where everything is on the table, from chlorinated chicken to the NHS. And if there\u2019s one thing we know to be true of Johnson, it\u2019s that he will say or do anything to quench his thirst for power. Let us not forget that being \u201cpro-Europe, pro-immigration, pro-cycling, anti-Trump\u201d secured him the keys to City Hall. Just a few years later, completely reversing this position propelled him into No 10 with the backing of less than 0.1% of the electorate. Catherine West MP Labour, Hornsey and Wood Green \u2022 Now that Johnson has spoken the reality is clear: there were always two Brexits.

But we should go further. Humanity is waging a veritable war on wildlife and nature every day. We are destroying habitats, changing the climate and persecuting animals that encroach on farmland that was once their home. The pursuit of wildlife for \u201ctrophies\u201d to adorn our walls and with which to pose is the cruellest wildlife crime of all. Scientists have warned that \u201csport\u201d hunting of lions is leading to a loss of genetic diversity that puts their survival at risk. The combined rate of deaths from poaching and trophy hunting is now greater than the birth rate of elephants. Permits are granted to hunters to shoot species that are extinct in the wild and of which just small numbers remain in private collections.</p> <p>The late Polly Higgins, the acclaimed environmental lawyer, called for ecocide to be considered a crime on a par with genocide. If we are serious about protecting wildlife, world leaders should implement her recommendation. We must also take steps towards abolishing trophy hunting, a \u201csport\u201d that is as senseless as it is damaging to wildlife. We can begin by banning the import of hunting trophies into Britain, and by calling on <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\" title=\"\">Cites</a> at its conference next month to close the loophole that presently allows trophy hunters to shoot endangered species.<br><strong>John Cooper QC, Rosalind Coward</strong> <em>Author, Greenpeace UK board member 2003-11</em>, <strong>Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves</strong> <em>President, Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting</em></p> <p>\u2022 The biggest threat to rare mosses is not gardeners buying peat but those wishing to carpet our moors with trees (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/23/specieswatch-uk-rainforest-threatened-gardeners-sphagnum-moss\" title=\"\">Specieswatch: the \u2018UK rainforest\u2019 threatened by gardeners</a>, 24 July).

      "bodyText": "Calls for a new Geneva convention to protect wildlife and nature reserves in conflict zones are welcome (Make environmental damage a war crime, say scientists, 25 July). But we should go further. Humanity is waging a veritable war on wildlife and nature every day. We are destroying habitats, changing the climate and persecuting animals that encroach on farmland that was once their home. The pursuit of wildlife for \u201ctrophies\u201d to adorn our walls and with which to pose is the cruellest wildlife crime of all. Scientists have warned that \u201csport\u201d hunting of lions is leading to a loss of genetic diversity that puts their survival at risk. The combined rate of deaths from poaching and trophy hunting is now greater than the birth rate of elephants. Permits are granted to hunters to shoot species that are extinct in the wild and of which just small numbers remain in private collections. The late Polly Higgins, the acclaimed environmental lawyer, called for ecocide to be considered a crime on a par with genocide. If we are serious about protecting wildlife, world leaders should implement her recommendation. We must also take steps towards abolishing trophy hunting, a \u201csport\u201d that is as senseless as it is damaging to wildlife. We can begin by banning the import of hunting trophies into Britain, and by calling on Cites at its conference next month to close the loophole that presently allows trophy hunters to shoot endangered species. John Cooper QC, Rosalind Coward Author, Greenpeace UK board member 2003-11, Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves President, Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting \u2022 The biggest threat to rare mosses is not gardeners buying peat but those wishing to carpet our moors with trees (Specieswatch: the \u2018UK rainforest\u2019 threatened by gardeners, 24 July). Our research found one of the best ways to increase sphagnum moss is through the occasional burning of the heather, to restore it, as practised on driven grouse moors. Mosses were highest on areas burnt between three and 10 years earlier yet were very low if the area was left unmanaged for 17 years or more. We must thank the hard work and dedication of gamekeepers who protect the future of this internationally significant resource.

The arrangements have become increasingly popular among bricks and mortar retailers who have struggled with high costs and the rise of online shopping.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8113512b-8ee0-49dc-80d3-0b56df87e441\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What\u2019s the problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, unseasonably warm weather, rising costs and broader economic problems. In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Primark is looking for rent reductions of up to 30%, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story.

In the current market, those rates are often lower than past rates.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spokesman added: \u201cLike any responsible retailer, we have a duty to our shareholders to maintain a competitive cost base, and we seek to maintain good relationships with our landlords.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jun/20/cva-high-street-landlords-rent-cuts-philip-green-arcadia-peter-simon-monsoon\">High street landlords hold a weak hand at the CVA poker game</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is not yet clear how many of the company\u2019s 189 stores might secure cost cuts, but Primark is thought to be offering some concessions in exchange.

      "bodyText": "Primark is pushing for rent cuts in a bid to bring its costs in line with high street rivals that have used insolvency proceedings to slash payments to landlords. The fast-fashion chain is understood to be in discussions with landlords over lower rents on properties where lease contracts are coming up for renewal. The move comes after competitors such as Monsoon and Topshop owner Arcadia pushed for lower rents as part of insolvency programmes known as company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). The arrangements have become increasingly popular among bricks and mortar retailers who have struggled with high costs and the rise of online shopping. Primark is looking for rent reductions of up to 30%, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story. Next, one of the healthier high street retailers along with Primark, said earlier this year that it cut rents by 29% for 28 leases renewed over 2018. A spokesman for Primark said: \u201cAs leases come to an end, we seek new agreements that reflect the prevailing market rental rate for the property and its circumstances. In the current market, those rates are often lower than past rates.\u201d The spokesman added: \u201cLike any responsible retailer, we have a duty to our shareholders to maintain a competitive cost base, and we seek to maintain good relationships with our landlords.\u201d It is not yet clear how many of the company\u2019s 189 stores might secure cost cuts, but Primark is thought to be offering some concessions in exchange. They include signing on to longer leases or investing in refurbishments that it believes will increase the property\u2019s value. Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, defied the high street exodus recently to open its biggest ever store in Birmingham, offering cafes, a beauty salon and a barbers over five floors. Rivals, however, are shutting stores at a rapid rate, with 75,000 retail jobs lost since last year. Tough high street conditions have forced the owner of footwear chain Office to become the latest retailer to consider a CVA. Its South African parent company, Truworths, has appointed turnaround advisors Alvarez &amp; Marsal to explore its options. Last month, landlords for Sir Philip Green\u2019s group, which has 570 stores, approved a restructuring plan that kept the company from falling into administration, saving 17,000 jobs. The agreement involved at least 23 store closures and rent cuts for nearly 200 stores. On Friday, Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley said the retail industry was in \u201cdire straits\u201d. He added that CVAs were being used as \u201ccarte blanche\u201d to penalise creditors and landlords, while leaving healthy retailers at a disadvantage. \u201cThe more successful retailers [are] subsidising the rotten ones,\u201d he said.",

Their musical groove influenced artists as varied as Little Feat, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Public Enemy and the Grateful Dead.</p> <p>Once Neville, who was nicknamed Poppa Funk, quit the Meters in 1977 he joined his siblings Charles, Aaron and Cyril to form the Neville Brothers, whose best- known album, Yellow Moon (1989), contained several landmark tracks including the title song, a version of Dylan\u2019s With God on Our Side, and Sister Rosa, their ode to the civil rights pioneer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/25/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">Rosa Parks</a>.

His father was a station porter fond of singing tunes by Nat King Cole and the Texan bluesman <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-charles-brown-1076504.html\" title=\"\">Charles Brown</a>. His mother was part of a dance act with her brother, George \u201cBig Chief Jolly\u201d Landry.</p> <p>Art was the oldest of the four brothers. His interest in playing keyboards was triggered at the age of three, when his grandmother took him to a New Orleans church where he spotted the organ. \u201cI turned the little switch and hit one of the low keys,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt scared the daylights out of me, but that was the first keyboard I played.\u201d</p> <p>He later began playing the piano and performing with his brothers, and in high school joined (and subsequently led) his first band, the Hawketts. He was the lead singer on their version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaqBwWJNUjI\" title=\"\">Mardi Gras Mambo</a>, a regional hit in 1954. It became a regular fixture at New Orleans\u2019s annual Mardi Gras celebrations.</p> <p>In 1958 he joined the US Navy, emerging in 1962 to continue his musical career. He formed Art Neville and the Neville Sounds, which included Aaron and Cyril before they quit to form their own group.

      "bodyText": "Art Neville, who has died aged 81, was a founder not only of the Meters, whose music in the late 1960s and early 70s helped to define the genre of New Orleans funk, but of the Neville Brothers, who were masters of various soul, blues and gospel styles and were distinguished by their intricate vocal harmonies. The Meters provided the musical backup for innumerable soul and funk artists, including on big-selling classics such as Lee Dorsey\u2019s Working in the Coal Mine (1966) and Labelle\u2019s Lady Marmalade (1974). But they also had hits in their own right, notably in 1969 with Cissy Strut (1969) and Look-Ka Py Py. Their musical groove influenced artists as varied as Little Feat, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Public Enemy and the Grateful Dead. Once Neville, who was nicknamed Poppa Funk, quit the Meters in 1977 he joined his siblings Charles, Aaron and Cyril to form the Neville Brothers, whose best- known album, Yellow Moon (1989), contained several landmark tracks including the title song, a version of Dylan\u2019s With God on Our Side, and Sister Rosa, their ode to the civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. They toured with major artists, including the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead and Tina Turner, and were traditionally the closing act on the final Sunday night of New Orleans\u2019s annual Jazz &amp; Heritage festival. Art was born in New Orleans to Arthur Neville and his wife, Amelia (nee Landry). His father was a station porter fond of singing tunes by Nat King Cole and the Texan bluesman Charles Brown. His mother was part of a dance act with her brother, George \u201cBig Chief Jolly\u201d Landry. Art was the oldest of the four brothers. His interest in playing keyboards was triggered at the age of three, when his grandmother took him to a New Orleans church where he spotted the organ. \u201cI turned the little switch and hit one of the low keys,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt scared the daylights out of me, but that was the first keyboard I played.\u201d He later began playing the piano and performing with his brothers, and in high school joined (and subsequently led) his first band, the Hawketts. He was the lead singer on their version of Mardi Gras Mambo, a regional hit in 1954. It became a regular fixture at New Orleans\u2019s annual Mardi Gras celebrations. In 1958 he joined the US Navy, emerging in 1962 to continue his musical career. He formed Art Neville and the Neville Sounds, which included Aaron and Cyril before they quit to form their own group. Now a four-piece completed by guitarist Leo Nocentelli, bass player George Porter Jr and drummer Joseph \u201cZigaboo\u201d Modeliste, they played regularly at New Orleans clubs, backing artists such as the Pointer Sisters and Lee Dorsey. In 1965 they became the Meters, whose refinement of the loping, syncopated rhythm called the \u201csecond line\u201d became emblematic of New Orleans funk. Prime examples included the group\u2019s hits Cissy Strut, Look-Ka Py Py, Chicken Strut (1970) and Hey Pocky A-Way (1974). Cissy Strut, which reached No 23 on the mainstream Billboard chart, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2011. The Meters made countless recordings as the house band for the songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint, with highlights including Working in the Coal Mine, which reached No 8 in the UK and the US, Dr John\u2019s album In the Right Place (1973), and Labelle\u2019s US chart-topper Lady Marmalade, a song about a prostitute in the French quarter of New Orleans with the famous line \u201cVoulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?\u201d In 1974 the Meters backed Robert Palmer on his album Sneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley, and in 1975 Paul McCartney invited them aboard the Queen Mary ocean liner in Long Beach, California, to play at the launch party of the Wings album Venus and Mars. Also present was Mick Jagger, who invited the Meters to support the Rolling Stones on their tours of the US and Europe in 1975-76. The group now included Cyril, who joined for their album Fire on the Bayou (1975). Art and Cyril quit the Meters in 1977 and formed the Neville Brothers with Aaron and Charles. The brothers had already gathered the previous year to back their uncle George Landry on the album The Wild Tchoupitoulas. At first the Neville Brothers were slow to gain recognition. Art recalled how when they used to play at Tipitina\u2019s in New Orleans \u201cyou could have blown it up and not hurt anyone but the Neville Brothers\u201d. Though Keith Richards hailed their 1981 album Fiyo on the Bayou as the finest of the year, sales were poor. They failed to release another studio album until Uptown (1987), a conscious effort to find a more mainstream sound (with Richards and Carlos Santana guesting) that prompted accusations of a sellout. A change of fortune came with Yellow Moon, sympathetically produced by Daniel Lanois, which successfully moulded the group\u2019s collective skills into a coherent whole. In 1989 the group won a Grammy for best pop instrumental performance for the Yellow Moon track Healing Chant. Outside the Neville Brothers Art began playing concerts with his former Meters bandmates, following a reunion at the 1989 New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage festival. They subsequently formed a new version of the band called the Funky Meters, and Art continued to perform with both outfits. He won another Grammy in 1996 with various artists for best rock instrumental performance for SRV Shuffle, a tribute to the guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan.

      "body": "<p>On Tuesday morning, more than 100 people gathered to march on a cabinet meeting at Essex county council\u2019s Chelmsford headquarters. In scorching heat, protesters turned out from Hullbridge and Benfleet, Hadleigh and Great Parndon and Tye Green. \u201cI need books, not screens,\u201d said the banner propped on a toddler\u2019s buggy. \u201cNo to the library vandals!\u201d read another.</p> <p>The Conservative-run local authority first unveiled its plans for libraries late last year, saying it hoped to close 25 of Essex\u2019s 74 branch libraries, handing 19 more to volunteers and 15 to partnership schemes. The people of Essex weren\u2019t impressed and the following months saw hundreds march against the cuts throughout the county: 500 in Manningtree, 500 in Galleywood, 300 in Colchester, 300 in Shenfield, 1,000 in Chelmsford. Tens of thousands also signed petitions in protest and a public consultation drew 20,000 responses. Then, earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/09/essex-drops-library-closure-plans-following-sustained-public-protests\">Essex executed a remarkable U-turn</a>, announcing that no library would close in the next five years.</p> <p>\u201cOur Future Libraries strategy has changed drastically due to what the people of Essex told us. I am delighted that the consultation ignited such passion for keeping the service alive,\u201d said councillor Susan Barker at the time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/25/do-libraries-run-by-volunteers-check-out\">Do libraries run by volunteers check out?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But despite the promises, Essex is still marching. Now the focus has shifted to plans for handing an unspecified number of branches to volunteers, which campaign group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SaveOurLibrariesEssex/\">Save Our Libraries Essex</a> (SOLE) calls \u201cstealth closures\u201d. A widely adopted measure by councils facing swingeing cuts, such branches are no longer the local authority\u2019s responsibility. Instead, they are put in the hands of unpaid, untrained members of the community who have to give up their own time to maintain regular opening hours.</p> <p>Protester Andy Abbott said: \u201cEssex is not really known as a hotbed of radicalism, and I think they probably thought people would take it lying down, I think they thought it would all go under the radar. It has really stunned them, the level of protest.</p> <p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for our protests a third of Essex libraries would be closing in just a few weeks\u2019 time. We prevented that from happening.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday morning, more than 100 people gathered to march on a cabinet meeting at Essex county council\u2019s Chelmsford headquarters. In scorching heat, protesters turned out from Hullbridge and Benfleet, Hadleigh and Great Parndon and Tye Green. \u201cI need books, not screens,\u201d said the banner propped on a toddler\u2019s buggy. \u201cNo to the library vandals!\u201d read another. The Conservative-run local authority first unveiled its plans for libraries late last year, saying it hoped to close 25 of Essex\u2019s 74 branch libraries, handing 19 more to volunteers and 15 to partnership schemes. The people of Essex weren\u2019t impressed and the following months saw hundreds march against the cuts throughout the county: 500 in Manningtree, 500 in Galleywood, 300 in Colchester, 300 in Shenfield, 1,000 in Chelmsford. Tens of thousands also signed petitions in protest and a public consultation drew 20,000 responses. Then, earlier this month, Essex executed a remarkable U-turn, announcing that no library would close in the next five years. \u201cOur Future Libraries strategy has changed drastically due to what the people of Essex told us. I am delighted that the consultation ignited such passion for keeping the service alive,\u201d said councillor Susan Barker at the time. But despite the promises, Essex is still marching. Now the focus has shifted to plans for handing an unspecified number of branches to volunteers, which campaign group Save Our Libraries Essex (SOLE) calls \u201cstealth closures\u201d. A widely adopted measure by councils facing swingeing cuts, such branches are no longer the local authority\u2019s responsibility. Instead, they are put in the hands of unpaid, untrained members of the community who have to give up their own time to maintain regular opening hours. Protester Andy Abbott said: \u201cEssex is not really known as a hotbed of radicalism, and I think they probably thought people would take it lying down, I think they thought it would all go under the radar. It has really stunned them, the level of protest. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for our protests a third of Essex libraries would be closing in just a few weeks\u2019 time. We prevented that from happening. But what they still have in place is a closure plan by stealth,\u201d he said. No details have been provided of how many branches would be handed to communities, but campaigners fear it will be a large proportion; Essex council has spoken of its ambition \u201cto create the largest network of community-run libraries in the country\u201d. Liz Miles, who is coordinating campaigns, said: \u201cThis is why people are very angry. All we know is from the strategy document is that they have received 80 expressions of interest for about 39 libraries,\u201d said \u201cNeither has Essex county council acknowledged that the expressions of interest came largely from the draft survey, which threatened to close 44 libraries (25 of them in September) unless people came forward with offers of interest. We hope that most of these will be withdrawn, now we have been promised that there is no danger of closure.\u201d Chants of \u201cNo ifs, no buts, no Essex library cuts\u201d accompanied Tuesday\u2019s protest outside the council building, where a tense meeting saw the cabinet approve the plans to keep all libraries open for the next five years. Essex council is offering groups who are interested in running a library \u00a318,000 over three years, along with an initial donation of books, training and a regular refresh of reading materials.

      "bodyText": "Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony to Congress \u201cbroke the lie\u201d Donald Trump has been telling and potentially cleared the path to impeachment, House judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler said on Sunday. That does not mean, however, that an attempt to remove Trump from office is set to begin. Adam Schiff, chair of the intelligence committee, said that \u201cfor the purposes of the law and constitution, where we are now is most accurately described as preliminary to a judicial proceeding\u201d. Nadler, a New York Democrat, was defending the decision to call former special counsel Mueller before Congress, amid controversy over the impact and value of his appearances before the judiciary and intelligence panels. \u201cI think it was very important that he testified,\u201d Nadler told ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cbecause he \u2026 broke the lie that the president and the attorney general have been saying to the American people. \u201cSince his report was issued the attorney general and the president have misrepresented that report, lied to the American people about it, said the report found no collusion, no obstruction and totally exonerated the president. \u201cAll those three statements are lies. It was very important for Mueller to get up there and say just that.\u201d In his testimony, Mueller did not go beyond the contents of his 448-page report into Russian election interference, links between Trump and Moscow and possible obstruction of justice by the president. Mueller had resisted the call to testify and observers noted the 74-year-old former FBI director\u2019s halting and reluctant demeanour. On Saturday the Washington Post went so far as to report that \u201csome lawmakers are privately wondering whether there was some truth to \u2026 rumours\u201d that Mueller \u201cmight not be as sharp as he once was\u201d. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment but Trump did not hesitate to crow about \u201cthe greatest display of ineptitude [and] incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen\u201d. Schiff told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday he wished Mueller \u201chad testified in more narrative fashion, that the words didn\u2019t need to be coaxed from him as much as they did\u201d. Mueller submitted his report in March and it was published in redacted form in April, after attorney general William Barr issued a summary of its contents which Democrats said was misleading. He did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Moscow but did lay out 11 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president or his campaign. Trump has claimed complete exoneration \u2013 as he did in tweets on Saturday in which he urged equal focus on supposed misdeeds by Democrats and FBI agents. Mueller stated both on paper and in person on Capitol Hill that he did not exonerate the president on questions of obstruction of justice. The White House has blocked attempts to call witnesses to testify, moves House Democrats say are unconstitutional, given their mandated oversight role. The result is a rolling battle for public opinion. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney fired his own shot on Sunday, telling CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that part of the president\u2019s motivation for a controversial attack on the House oversight chairman was that Elijah Cummings \u201cis spending all of his time on this impeachment inquiry which we all know is going nowhere\u201d. In turn, Nadler made clear Democrats believe Mueller\u2019s testimony had PR value. \u201cThe hearing was an inflection point,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cIt showed quite clearly that the report did not exonerate the president, that it found that the Russian government interfered in the campaign, they tried to interfere in our election and the Trump campaign welcomed that assistance and co-operated. \u201cAnd then the president lied repeatedly to the American people and to investigators and conducted a corrupt cover-up with at least five criminally indictable acts of obstruction of justice.\u201d As Mueller repeatedly pointed out, a Department of Justice opinion holds that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The special counsel also stressed that he was not saying he would have indicted Trump but for the opinion\u2019s existence. Nonetheless, Nadler told CNN, \u201cthese are very serious offences against the rule of law and we now have to get further evidence and put it before the American people as we consider articles of impeachment in the committee.\u201d Nadler repeated his view that Trump \u201cutterly deserves\u201d to be removed. On Friday, in a suit that mentioned the word impeachment 76 times, the judiciary committee petitioned in court for access to evidence collected by Mueller. Nadler said such evidence might include material on possible wrongdoing by Trump outside the Russia inquiry, for example under the emoluments clause of the constitution which is meant to guard against personal gain from public office. Schiff told NBC: \u201cRight now the most important thing is to obtain the grand jury material, to see the evidence.\u201d Around 100 Democrats in the House, less than half the caucus, have come out in support of impeachment. Nadler rejected a claim by California Democrat Jackie Speier that if impeachment has not begun by September it will be too late, given the proximity of the 2020 election. As well as the near-guarantee that impeachment would fail in the Republican-held Senate, Democratic leaders are wary of galvanising Trump supporters. Schiff said he worried \u201cabout the message of taking an impeachment case to trial, losing that case, having the president acquitted, and then having an adjudication that this conduct is not impeachable. \u201cBut the jury that I\u2019m most worried about, not the Senate because I think that\u2019s a preordained conclusion, is the American people. Can we make the case to the American people? And I want to make sure that that\u2019s true before we go down this path because it\u2019s going to occupy a year of the nation\u2019s time.

      "body": "<p>How should our society reward those who serve it well? In times past, it was simple. The monarch, not just a symbol of society but then its embodiment, proffered wealth, land and title. In these halcyon days of democracy, neither the Queen nor the prime minister can give chums and lackeys pots of gold and tracts of Lincolnshire, but some things stay the same: on our behalf, they still distribute preferment in the form of honours.</p> <p>It is truly an anachronism and by tinkering with its flaws, those who control the system yearly seek to make it more reflective of a modern age. But they delude themselves, for even on its own terms as a rough and ready mechanism for giving all sections of society the chance to be recognised for outstanding service and contribution, the system does not work.</p> <p>We hand out about 2,000 honours each year in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours list and the new year honours list. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/21/after-100-years-is-it-time-to-remove-empire-from-uk-honours-system\" title=\"\">there\u2019s an issue</a> those who administer the process are loth to recognise.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was thinking this is an issue now. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to be able to accept this. So I wasn\u2019t jumping for joy</p> <footer> <cite>Dotun Adebayo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This system of societal reward carries on against the backdrop of a never-ending drumbeat of appeals, indeed an insistence, that Britons from minority backgrounds should play a full and constructive role in making this a fair and equal society. But it is a system that speaks not of Britain today or even the Britain of this century, but of Britain and its long-passed empire. It offers honours in our name, such as Order of the British Empire, that many deserving people \u2013 artists, musicians, doctors, professors, sports stars, activists, politicians \u2013 cannot in good conscience accept.</p> <p>For many minorities, the empire is much more than a historical footnote. Its enduring symbols and psychological legacies remain a live issue and an open wound. To accept this type of preferment is to attach them inextricably to a thing that they despise; to forge a link with Britain\u2019s past that would, to many they respect or might wish to represent, be unacceptable. Is that desirable or right? Having spent time speaking to minority Britons who have been obliged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/25/mbe-obe-honour-or-betrayal\" title=\"\">confront this dilemma</a>, I don\u2019t think it is.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to overstate the case. Minority Britain is not a monolith. Some nominated minority Britons go happily to Buckingham Palace, unencumbered by qualms or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/obe-empire-david-olusoga\" title=\"\">baggage of empire</a>. I asked Samir Shah, the celebrated TV executive and former chair of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, how long it took him to accept his OBE in 2000 (upgraded this year to a CBE). \u201cA nanosecond,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>But others have refused outright. Think of the writer Benjamin Zephaniah, who roundly and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/27/poetry.monarchy\" title=\"\">very publicly rejected</a> an OBE in 2003. \u201cI thought that it wasn\u2019t just good enough for me to just say no and just leave it quietly,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think I had to make a big statement to people generally, but especially to people in my community, to say, look, we don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Howard Gayle, the first black footballer to break through into the Liverpool team in the 1980s and now a tireless community worker. He told me his decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/howard-gayle-mbe-liverpool-first-black-footballer\" title=\"\">turn down an MBE</a> for his work with the anti-racism group Kick It Out was a no-brainer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long history in colonialism and slavery and we\u2019ve never, ever been thought of as a culture deserving of an apology for what was done to us and to our ancestors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9730c5480d91f3851e3039b6e0c2a0f0204b46d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9730c5480d91f3851e3039b6e0c2a0f0204b46d/0_0_3048_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benjamin Zephaniah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"955\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benjamin Zephaniah: \u2018I thought that it wasn\u2019t just good enough for me to just say no and just leave it quietly.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susannah Ireland/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both men made a choice and happily live with it.

      "bodyText": "How should our society reward those who serve it well? In times past, it was simple. The monarch, not just a symbol of society but then its embodiment, proffered wealth, land and title. In these halcyon days of democracy, neither the Queen nor the prime minister can give chums and lackeys pots of gold and tracts of Lincolnshire, but some things stay the same: on our behalf, they still distribute preferment in the form of honours. It is truly an anachronism and by tinkering with its flaws, those who control the system yearly seek to make it more reflective of a modern age. But they delude themselves, for even on its own terms as a rough and ready mechanism for giving all sections of society the chance to be recognised for outstanding service and contribution, the system does not work. We hand out about 2,000 honours each year in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours list and the new year honours list. But there\u2019s an issue those who administer the process are loth to recognise. This system of societal reward carries on against the backdrop of a never-ending drumbeat of appeals, indeed an insistence, that Britons from minority backgrounds should play a full and constructive role in making this a fair and equal society. But it is a system that speaks not of Britain today or even the Britain of this century, but of Britain and its long-passed empire. It offers honours in our name, such as Order of the British Empire, that many deserving people \u2013 artists, musicians, doctors, professors, sports stars, activists, politicians \u2013 cannot in good conscience accept. For many minorities, the empire is much more than a historical footnote. Its enduring symbols and psychological legacies remain a live issue and an open wound. To accept this type of preferment is to attach them inextricably to a thing that they despise; to forge a link with Britain\u2019s past that would, to many they respect or might wish to represent, be unacceptable. Is that desirable or right? Having spent time speaking to minority Britons who have been obliged to confront this dilemma, I don\u2019t think it is. I don\u2019t want to overstate the case. Minority Britain is not a monolith. Some nominated minority Britons go happily to Buckingham Palace, unencumbered by qualms or the baggage of empire. I asked Samir Shah, the celebrated TV executive and former chair of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, how long it took him to accept his OBE in 2000 (upgraded this year to a CBE). \u201cA nanosecond,\u201d he told me.

Anyway, how do the driver standings look? Hamilton 223 Bottas 184 Verstappen 162 Vettel 141 Leclerc 120 Gasly 55 Sainz 48 Raikkonen 31 Kvyat 27 Norris 22 \u201cIt\u2019s a day to learn,\u201d deadpans Mercedes honcho, Toto Wolff. He is not all that happy with life. What a shame if that\u2019s the last German Grand Prix for a while. It does sort of look that way, but Formula 1 being Formula 1, you never know. The band strike up and what a race that was! The podium lads raise their trinkets and out comes the fizz! Podium and anthem time! Ok, let\u2019s have a full list of finishers: Verstappen Vettel Kvyat Stroll Sainz Albon Raikkonen Giovinazzi Grosjean Magnussen Hamilton Kubica Russell Kvyat\u2019s missus had a baby girl last night! Great stuff. Mazal tov! Before the last safety car, Vettel thought he could do something because he felt like he was faster than the others, so passing them was relatively straightforward. \u201cIt was a long race,\u201d says Vettel. \u201cAt some points it felt like it was never ending, but it was good fun.\u201d Verstappen says it was amazing out there, he enjoyed it and it was all about trying not to make too many mistakes in really difficult conditions. \u201cAll credit in the world to Verstappen,\u201d says Amanda Orson, \u201cbut Vettel going from #20 to #2 is just incredible. He should have been Driver of the Day.\u201d Can\u2019t argue with that. Verstappen gets out of his car and celebrates his second win in three races with his team. \u201cWhat a race\u201d says Vettel, an observation accurate both generally and specifically. \u201cWhat a result!\u201d says Verstappen to his team. He is delighted, and why not. And Sebastian Vettel comes second from the back of the grid, with Daniil Kvyat coming third! Lap 63/64 Come on! Vettel absolutely mashes Kvyat on the straight and the crowd go wild! He\u2019s second now, while Versatappen leads by more than four seconds! But what an effort from Vettel, who started at the back of the grid! Lap 62/64 Albon blocks off Gasly and Gasly can\u2019t stay away, bumping him and ruining his own chances\u00b1 Lap 61/64 Verstappen extends his lead - it\u2019s 2.475s to Kvyat, who leads Stroll ... no he doesn\u2019t! He can\u2019t handle Vettel\u2019s power, and Vettel takes him out! Lap 61/64 Juna Pablo Montoya once finished second from the back of the grid; can Vettel get onto the podium? He\u2019s fourth, less than half a second behind Stroll! Lap 60/64 Vettel gains on Sainz, who holds him off, then Vettel sorts him on the inside! Superb! Then Albon does Gasly to move sixth and it\u2019s all going on! Lap 59/64 The safety car departs and Verstappen steps on it! Five laps to go! Lap 59/64 Right, our placing: 1. Verstappen 2. Kvyat 3. Stroll 4. Sainz 5. Vettel 6. Albon Lap 58/64 Bottas\u2019 gaffer was proper vex when he spun off. Lovely stuff. Lap 58/64 They reckon it\u2019ll take three laps to remove Bottas\u2019 debris as Hamilton pits again; presumably he\u2019s seeking a fastest lap point, though needs to get into the top 10 for that. Lap 57/64 Back comes the safety car as we see Bottas\u2019s spin - he slides on a bit of water and his rear tyres take him off. That will not be unwelcome to the 15th-placed Hamilton; did I say 15th? I meant 15th and last. Lap 56/64 AND BOTTAS, PUSHING HARD TO ATTACK STROLL, SPINS OFF! WHAT IS GOING ON! WHAT A RACE! MEANWHILE, IN MERCEDES DIGS, TABLES ARE THUMPED! Lap 56/64 Sainz is now in that battle for third with Stroll and Bottas, with Vettel behind them in sixth place. Lap 55/64 Verstappen leads by 9.903 from Kvyat, while Bottas tries to relieve Stroll of his third place. Verstappen just got his tyres exactly right, while the rain came at exactly the wrong point for Hamilton. Lap 54/64 Hamilton is 14th now, and pits for a change of tyres! He needs something out of Wacky Races! Lap 53/64 It\u2019s impossible to see anyone catching Verstappen now, and with Kvyat behind him we\u2019re looking at a Honda one-two ... but then Hamilton goes off the track! He went wide at a corner, too wide, spun, and though he managed to right himself lost plenty of time in so doing. His run of 22 point-accumulating races is surely at an end! Lap 52/64 Vettel is carving through the field, currently sitting seventh but lapping fastest of all of them. Hamilton has been extremely quiet since finding himself 12th. Lap 51/64 Stroll was the first Canadian to lead a race since Jacques Villeneuve, but now he\u2019s third - Kvyat passes him. The gap to Verstappen is 9.128s/ Lap 50/64 Albon goes by Magnussen as the track dries out... Lap 48/64 This is an absolutely ridiculous race! Verstappen nails Stroll and records the fastest lap of the race, then seconds later Kvyat beats it; in between the two is Stroll, and fourth is Bottas, fifth is Sainz, sixth is Magnussen. Lap 48/64 Hamilton pits and Stroll takes the lead! Verstappen is just behind - 0.176s - and Hamilton serves his penalty to rejoin the race in twelfth. Lap 47/64 Bottas pits too and Hamilton leads the race now, 2.556s ahead of Raikkonen, from Vettel, from Giovinazzi, from Stroll, from Verstappen. Lap 46/64 Off goes the safety car and Albon and Sainz both attack Hamilton! One on each side! But around the corner he holds it down! Albon then finds himself sliding from fourth to eighth, while in front Verstappen extends his lead to 3.964 before pitting for slicks! Lap 45/64 There\u2019s no rain expected so Bottas\u2019 team tell him he needs to get at Verstappen immediately. Hamilton, meanwhile, will probably need to pit at some point, which will mean he has to take his penalty then, not at the line. The safety car is almost away. Lap 44/64 Imagine John Terry taking a penalty on this track. Lap 44/64 We see Hulkenberg debriefing with his team; he looks \u201cgutted\u201d. Lap 43/64 Vettel leads Bottas by 1.8s as the safety car mooches around; Hamilton will be gearing up for a proper assault when it departs but would presumably have liked as long as possible to make up the gap. Lap 42/64 Vettel, seventh, also pits and picks inters. Lap 41/64 Hulkenberg is out of his car as Hamilton closes on Bottas and Verstappen pits onto inters! Lap 41/64 Well this has been a quiet night in at the library. No podium for Hulkenberg, who finds himself off the track - it\u2019s not obvious how he\u2019s done that - and that\u2019ll be the safety car back on! What a mistake! Lap 40/64 Rare mistake from Raikkonen who slides, misses his steer, drives off the track and has to force his way back on. He\u2019s ninth now. Lap 39/64 But Hamilton isn\u2019t having it; he\u2019s never be satisfied, and absolutely nails Hulkenberg. That\u2019s him in third, roughly 11 seconds off the pace and two behind Bottas. Lap 38/64 Hulkenberg has never finished on the podium, but might just manage it today if Hamilton gets another penalty. It\u2019s raining a little, but not heavily. Lap 37/64 Verstappen is seven seconds clear but Hamilton is going faster than him - though he\u2019s also under investigation for behind the safety car behaviour. Bottas, meanwhile, is far too quick for Hulkenberg and passes him into second. The lead is 8.583s. Lap 36/64 Hamilton is absolutely ganting to do Albon, who bravely holds him up to begin with but has no answer when he goes by. Lap 35/64 Versatppen pulls away from Hulkenberg - his lead is 4.643 now and increasing all the time. Lap 34/64 Five second penalty for Hamilton for going the wrong side of the bollard! If he pits again he\u2019ll have to wait the time out; if he doesn\u2019t it\u2019ll be added to his finishing time! Lap 34/64 Let\u2019s go racing! Off they go again! Hamilton is 4.70 off the front! Lap 33/64 The safety car is away presently. Lap 33/64 Albon is doing pretty well for someone who\u2019s never driven an F1 car in the rain. Or maybe it\u2019s not that difficult. Lap 33/64 Verstappen leads by 0.801 from Hulkonen, then it\u2019s Bottas, Albon, Hamilton, Sainz, Raikkonen, Vettel. This is so set-up it\u2019s ridiculous. Lap 32/64 Hamilton\u2019s team don\u2019t think the damage to the car is too bad, but meantime he\u2019s down in fifth. Lap 31/64 Hamilton might\u2019ve gone into the pits the wrong side of the bollards ... they\u2019re investigating. Versatappen, on intermediates, leads and looks good all of a sudden! Lap 30/64 The safety car is still out but Bottas goes in and Verstappen leads! Lap 30/64 Who saw that coming? Hamilton was absolutely cruising, but now he\u2019s fifth behind Albon, Hulkenberg, Verstappen and Bottas - that\u2019s in ascending order. Lap 30/64 OH MY DAYS! Hamilton goes off where Leclerc did, manages to stay on, and needs a new front wing! They\u2019re not ready for him in the pits and Bottas takes the lead! It\u2019s all going on! Lap 29/64 Nightmare for Leclerc, who was in position to challenge for the lead, and he hollers his agony. Looking again, a tiny bit of understeer saw him slide, the back came out from under him and there he went. The safety car comes on... Lap 29/64 Hamilton goes in while Leclerc stays ahead of Bottas. Hamilton\u2019s stop is a long one and LECLERC GOES WIDE AND CRASHES OUT! Lap 28/64 Norris has lost power and is off! 1. Hamilton 2. Leclerc 3. Bottas 4. Verstappen 5. Hulkenberg 6. Albon 7. Raikkonen 8. Vettel 9. Sainz 10. Giovinazzi 11. Gasly 12. Grosjean Lap 27/64 In goes Bottas ... and Verstappen spins on a kerb and is driving very slowly indeed! Will that be the beginning of the end for him? Lap 26/64 Leclerc\u2019s advantage is done; he\u2019s no longer lapping faster than the rest, but sits third now Verstappen has pitted. Lap 26/64 Verstappen goes in! Red Bull gamble, and go for mediums, maybe even to the end! Lap 25/64 Hamilton leads by 8.599, and is asking his boys how Magnussen\u2019s getting on on slicks. The answer is pretty well. The corners are wet, but everywhere else is largely dry. Lap 25/64 Vettel pits and comes back in 11th, Grossjean passing him, but he\u2019s on softs. If it doesn\u2019t rain properly, he\u2019ll be set; if it does, his team will look silly. Lap 24/64 I can\u2019t even remember the last time we saw Hamilton. He\u2019s in quarantine there at the front. Lap 23/64 Magnussen, in 16th, pits, and goes for slicksI think. It\u2019s raining and will continue so to do for 10 minutes, but with very little enthusiasm. Lap 22/64 Bottas leads Verstappen by 1.1310s; Verstappen has closed slightly, but has roughly seven laps before Leclerc is right in his chevy chase. Lap 21/64 Vettel doesn\u2019t like his tyres but his team are keeping him out for at least one more lap. He\u2019s seventh currently, and can only be pleased with that except he isn\u2019t because that\u2019s the type of people these people are. Lap 20/64 We\u2019re expecting more rain in the immediate future, but in the meantime Leclerc, on intermediates, is still on a boust. He\u2019s gained six places after starting tenth on the grid and is 4.7s behind Verstappen, whom he\u2019s chasing. Lap 19/64 Cut to see Sainz with his nose into the wall. He manages to get himself out of there, but is now 15th! We then see that he went into a spin, and apologises to his team. Lap 19/64 Leclerc\u2019s boys tell him he\u2019s the quickest, and he\u2019s closing the gap a little. Lap 18/64 Leclerc was more than three seconds faster than Hamilton on that last lap. He\u2019s in fourth, more than six seconds behind Versatppen. Lap 17/64 Verstappen fancies he can get Bottas! But then he gets too close, the back of the car doesn\u2019t stick, he turns away from the lane and from the corner, and ends up having to go off the track to stay involved! Lap 16/64 Versatppen contemplates slicks, decides against it on this lap but is still discussing the possibility. Lap 16/64 Hamilton leads by 6.513 now, which is decent - we\u2019ve hardly seen him, which tells you how comfortable he is. Lap 15/64 Ricciardo was going for his seventh finish on the spin, and they chuck out the virtual safety car while they clear the much. Lap 14/64 Gosh, Ricciardo\u2019s car is gozzing muck all over the show and he\u2019s out of the race! Lap 13/64 Vettel, it\u2019s though, has a problem, and is losing time; Leclerc, meanwhile, avoids a penalty for an unsafe early release, but Ferrari are fined. I don\u2019t see the point of that, given I\u2019m fairly sure they can find the funds down the back of the couch. Lap 12/64 Raikonnen is pulling away from Vettel, who\u2019s seventh; he was getting caught by Sainz, but is now back building the difference. We\u2019re expecting rain in the next 10-15 minutes. Lap 11/64 So our leaderboard goes: 1.Hamilton 2. Bottas 3. Verstappen 4. Leclerc 5. Hulkenberg 6. Raikkonen Lap 11/64 It\u2019s drying up pretty quickly, we\u2019re told. Lap 10/64 Hamilton looks so solid out there. It\u2019s hard to see anyone doing anything about this ... but there\u2019s heavier rain expected in the next 10-15 minutes. Lap 9/64 Vettle\u2019s up from 20th to ninth; I daresay he famcies himself for some podium here. Lap 8/64 Vettel passes Magnussen and so does Sainz. Hamilton\u2019s lead is 2.8. Lap 7/64 Vettel is 17-odd seconds behind Hamilton, but Hamilton is extending his lead at the front. He, Bottas and Verstappen are miles faster that the rest. Lap 6/64 Vettel up to eighth now, and this is excellent from him. Lap 5/64 Behind Magnussen, in fifth, is Leclerc ... but he storms past! He had so much more power there, and Hulkenberg also bousts away. Lap 5/64 Bottas rushes past Magnussen and Verstappen goes by him too, able to break much later than both the others. Lap 4/64 The safety flag goes in and we\u2019re back away again. Hamilton pulls away... Lap 4/64 Bottas and Versatppen both pit, so Magnussen is now second with Bottas third, Verstappen fourth. Lap 4/64 Hamilton has time to pit and come out still in front. His lead is 5.912. Lap 3/64 Vettel goes in for some intermediates; Hamilton is told that he\u2019s going into the pits behind the safety car Lap 2/64 Sainz has already been off three times, and Vettel is 13th. Verstappen, meanwhile, barges past Raikkonen, and Perez bangs into the wall, ends up with a flat, and THE SAFETY CAR IS COMING ON! Lap 2/64 Versappen is fourth, Hulkonen fifth, then Leclerc, Gorssjean and Sainz! Hamilton leads by 2.254, pretty good! Lap 1/64 Vettel is up six places already! Lap 1/64 Hamilton gets away well, and Bottas does Verstappen right away! So does Raikkonen! AND WE\u2019RE AWAY! It\u2019s now a 64-lap race! Those three have come off the total. The safety car skips off to the pits, and the cars pull into the grid. We\u2019re nearly there... Come on lads, let\u2019s be having you. And round they go again! Hamilton wants to get on with it. They go round for another lap, behind the safety car, and no one\u2019s quite sure what\u2019s going on: whether it\u2019s a rolling start or a standing start. I take it back. The Racing Point car looks like Germolene. And off we go... The formation laps will start on time, behind the safety car, with everyone on wets. They reckon it\u2019s going to be raining for the first hour ten or so. Basically, we need Choni HaM\u2019agel; \u201ccircle-drawing incident\u201d is one of my favourite Wikipedia headings ever. The Racing Point car looks like a tube of toothpaste. Norris notes that not only is it wet but there\u2019s poor visibility. He\u2019s got some confidence, and pretending not to be arsed that Vettel\u2019s next to him. Vettel is forced to answer questions, confirming that he\u2019s on wets while striding purposefully away and wearing an \u201cI\u2019m being super friendly but do one\u201d face. Various of the drivers haven\u2019t experienced a wet race, and Alex Albon, who is one of them, confirms that it\u2019s very slippery out there. Anthem time! Kevin Magnussen is using wets or, put another way, there\u2019s no definitive school of thought about how to approach these conditions. The Renault drivers aren\u2019t sure what tyres to use, we learn. George Russell says it\u2019s very slippery but doesn\u2019t think it needs a safety car start. The track doesn\u2019t look too wet, says Martin Brundle, so intermediates are the order of the day. Talking of yerman... Should every race be in the rain? I believe there\u2019s a procedure called seeding that can make this happen. They got me at \u201cpunch-ups\u201d. Lando Norris, who qualified 16th, will now be starting from the back of the grid after taking on new MGU-K, energy store and control electronics. Lots of drivers are sneaking in an extra little practice. There\u2019s bare spritz all over the show. It\u2019s pretty wet in Hockenheim, so I assume Schumacher will win. I\u2019m not surprised Hamilton is pushing through. Everyone knows that you force yourself to work when you\u2019re ill so you can take a sickie when you\u2019re in shape to enjoy it. It\u2019s one of those where he\u2019s almost doing too well. Of the 11 Grands Prix so far this season, Lewis Hamilton has won eight, finished second twice, and fifth once, leading Valtteri Bottas at the top of the driver standings by 39 points. He\u2019s in a good spot. Problem being that he\u2019s now ill. Not too ill to secure pole position for today\u2019s race, but finding a few fast laps is not the same as putting body and mind through 67 of the blighters. Behind him, Jos Verstappen and Bottas, second and third on the grid respectively, will be fancying the ruckus. The Hockenheimring is one of the best circuits in the world for overtaking, but on the other hand, only Hamilton has won a race on it. If he can find a way to do likewise today, a sixth championship will look like a formality. Start: 2.10pm BST, 3.10pm local time.",

Brunt sprays a wide and Perry gets off strike with one, so there won\u2019t be a fifty. Lanning has one run left to win it... and she does, with a single behind point.

      "bodyText": "Never in doubt. Yes, Australia did lose three wickets early on but the moment the best two players in the world came together was the moment the contest came to a close. They are unstoppable, their stand unbeaten on 87 when the winning run was scored. Lanning\u2019s side are now one win away from going through this tour undefeated. As for Knight\u2019s team, they are absolutely nowhere at the moment. Thanks for your company on the OBO today. We\u2019ll be back in Bristol on Wednesday night for the final Women\u2019s Ashes T20. Bye for now! 17.5 overs: Australia 122-3 (Lanning 43, Perry 47) Target 122. Brunt drifts onto Perry\u2019s pads and she helps it on its way. Brunt roars with frustration. Perry becomes the first player in men or women\u2019s T20 international cricket to collect 1000 runs and 100 wickets. Just brilliant. Brunt sprays a wide and Perry gets off strike with one, so there won\u2019t be a fifty. Lanning has one run left to win it... and she does, with a single behind point. They\u2019ve done it with ease. 17th over: Australia 113-3 (Lanning 41, Perry 41) Target 122. Ecclestone into her last over but it doesn\u2019t matter now in terms of this\u2019s result. Can she get another wicket? She won\u2019t but it is a tough set to get away, three singles their lot. The spinner finishes with 1/18. 16th over: Australia 110-3 (Lanning 39, Perry 40) Target 122. Perry brings up the Australian 100 with style, dancing down the track at Marsh and clobbering her over the midwicket rope. Six of the best! Lanning fancies a half-century herself, dancing too before directing over mid-off with a no fuss at all for four more. Too easy. 12 off it. 15th over: Australia 98-3 (Lanning 34, Perry 33) Target 122. Sciver drops short to Lanning who wants all of it, carting her through backward square on the front foot into the gap - see you later. The all-rounder wins the edge to finish but Lanning is deep in the crease cutting, running away for another four. 11 off the over. Game over. 14th over: Australia 87-3 (Lanning 25, Perry 31) Target 122. Brunt is back now too and tries to bang it in short at Perry to start her fresh set but the superstar is having none of that, leaning back to cream her through midwicket for four. The 50-partnership comes up (from 43 balls) off the next ball. There is no way that England can contain the runs remaining from here - they need wickets, pronto. 13th over: Australia 80-3 (Lanning 24, Perry 25) Target 122. Ecclestone, who has 1/6 from her two overs, is back for her third. Another important over: England\u2019s best bowler has to break this up. Perry is good enough to split the gap at backward point for a couple to begin, repeating the dose to the other side of point for two more. She saves a brilliant shot for later in the over, dancing and clipping over midwicket into the gap for a timely boundary. Ecclestone forces a miscued push to mid-off to finish but the over has gone for nine. Australia need 42 runs from 42 balls to wrap up the T20 mini-series. 12th over: Australia 71-3 (Lanning 23, Perry 17) Target 122. Sciver, who Isa Guha notes was England\u2019s opening bowler in last year\u2019s World T20, is now on. \u201cYou just want senior players saying to give them the new ball,\u201d the former England international\u2019s critique after that job was given to Elwiss in this innings. It is an accurate over from the strong all-rounder, going for just four singles. 11th over: Australia 67-3 (Lanning 21, Perry 15) Target 122. Big over this from Kate Cross, back for her third. Seven are added, which Australia will be happy with at this stage. It would have been nine if not for an excellent dive by Brunt on the backward square rope. 10th over: Australia 60-3 (Lanning 19, Perry 10) Target 122. The evergeeen Marsh goes again and is where she has to be but Lanning makes room to play a stroke we saw so often on Friday night, dancing and elevating inside-out over cover for her second boundary. \u201cWhat a shot,\u201d says Charlotte Edwards on TV. \u201cSuperb.\u201d 9th over: Australia 52-3 (Lanning 13, Perry 8) Target 122. Elwiss is back for her second over and it goes a lot better than the first at the top of the innings but Perry is able to free her arms to cut one boundary along the way. Eight off it at a good time for the visitors. 8th over: Australia 44-3 (Lanning 11, Perry 2) Target 122. Marsh is on and there is some action to begin, Wyatt with a chance to running out Perry but the throw isn\u2019t on the mark. Jones tries to deflect the ball onto the stumps rather than gloving it, too. That\u2019s a huge opportunity gone begging for the hosts - 41/4 with Perry gone and this is on. Even so, it\u2019s a handy over with just three coming from it. 7th over: Australia 41-3 (Lanning 9, Perry 1) Target 122. Lanning doesn\u2019t make the same mistake as Gardner, getting four from another short and wide Cross offering, albeit off the toe end of the bat. She keeps the strike thanks to a Beaumont misfield at point. Short and wide but perhaps a little bit of extra bounce is enough to force an error from Gardner, placing Cross to Marsh at short third! Australia should still win this easily but England have a pulse. 6th over: Australia 35-2 (Lanning 4, Gardner 1) Target 122. Lanning gets moving from Brunt with a couple to square leg then another to third. Gardner has walked out in front of Perry, as she did on Friday night. Brunt tries to bump her first up but it is way over head - wide ball. She gets off the mark from another shorter deliver, pulling out to deep midwicket for a single. England will have to bowl them out. Ecclestone does Mooney with one that skids on! Lovely bowling from the classy left-armer. Better still after being hit for four down the ground for four earlier in the over. England have been rinsed in this series but the left-armer leaves with her reputation enhanced. 5th over: Australia 30-2 (Lanning 1) Target 122. 4th over: Australia 26-1 (Mooney 5, Lanning 1) Target 122. Lanning is nearly run out for a diamond duck! The throw from Cross was quick but not quite accurate enough - it needed to be perfect. Jones gets the bails but a dive from the Australian skipper gets her home. Mooney isn\u2019t far away from losing her wicket too, miscuing a short-arm jab out to deep square leg, falling just metres in front of Wyatt. It is always eventful when Katherine Brunt is at the bowling crease. Brunt gets Healy first ball! It was short but the extra pace did the damage, winning a top edge on the pull that Jones takes well. 3rd over: Australia 23-0 (Healy 20, Mooney 3) Target 122. Sure enough, Ecclestone is right on the money and doesn\u2019t allow Mooney or Healy anything to hit. She\u2019s without doubt England\u2019s best bowler. 2nd over: Australia 21-0 (Healy 19, Mooney 2) Target 122. Cross gets the second over rather than the first. Mooney is off strike with one to square leg to begin. Healy gets another chance for easy runs off her pads, clipping four more when Cross misses her mark. Too easy. Elwiss hasn\u2019t opened the bowling in any match since 2012, Lydia Greenway tells us on the television. What a strange decision. 1st over: Australia 14-0 (Healy 14, Mooney 0) Target 122. A rank full toss allows Healy to get busy from the second ball of the chase, smashing her over midwicket with ease for four. Next up, she overcorrects and allows the Australian opener to crunch four more over point. More width now, Healy cutting a couple more; well stopped by Ecclestone on the rope. A third boundary to finish, steering with ease to the third man rope. Starts don\u2019t come much gentler than that. They could win this in a real hurry. As Mel Jones says on TV, why is Elwiss bowling the first over? Odd. The players are back on the field! Elwiss is taking the new ball at Healy, who is opening with Mooney. PLAY! Back in 15 for the chase. See you then. 20th over: England 121-8 (Ecclestone 17, Marsh 1) Ecclestone does the job at the death, making room to lift Schutt over long-off, just clearing Haynes\u2019 fingertips. That six It gets England beyond a run a ball, which isn\u2019t a bad effort considering how poorly they batted. Ecclestone takes Schutt through the gap at midwicket for four to begin the over but there is a bad mix-up from the second delivery, Elwiss coming back for a second run out to backward square but the spinner wasn\u2019t coming. Gardner\u2019s throw and Healy\u2019s backhanded effort with the gloves were enough to get Australia an eighth wicket. 19th over: England 108-7 (Elwiss 5, Ecclestone 6) Five singles to the sweepers but they can find the gaps against Jonassen. She finishes with 2/19 with nine dots along the way. She\u2019s been excellent. \u201cInsofar as placement of fielders is concerned,\u201d emails Sarah Bacon, \u201cwhile England has managed to loft a few past the fingertips of the Aussie fielders, I think that Australia is proving better equiped in this area. Thoughts?\u201d Yep, Australia have outcaught England comprehensively in this series. The hosts looked overwhelmed in the field on Friday. 18th over: England 103-7 (Elwiss 3, Ecclestone 3) England have raised their 100 with an Elwiss single to cover but there isn\u2019t much to get excited about in another successful over. Brunt was actually given out caught before she was stumped, ala Brian Lara v Zoe Goss. Brunt dances at Kimmince but she sees her coming, sending it out wide and beating the bat, Healy doing the rest after missing the bails to begin. But it doesn\u2019t matter - the \u2018keeper has loads of time. 17th over: England 98-6 (Brunt 6, Elwiss 1) The third ump takes their time to give Elwiss not out, her dive to Healy\u2019s end over the line. She is then off the mark first ball in her first T20 since 2016. Straight down backward square\u2019s throat! Winfield had to go and hit it well but has picked out the boundary rider. 16th over: England 94-5 (Winfield 12, Brunt 3) Whoa, a SIX! The first of the innings. A fine one too, Winfield taking Wareham straight back over her head. The first boundary in six overs. By contrast, Australia struck 40 (nine sixes, 31 fours) on Friday night. A lot of work to do. 15th over: England 84-5 (Winfield 4, Brunt 1) Big appeal for lbw, Healy insisting that Kimmince had Winfield, but turned down. Must have been very close but without DRS, we\u2019ll never know. Sigh. A wide and three singles isn\u2019t going to be enough to get this tally up to anything credible so they\u2019re going to have to bowl the house down. 14th over: England 80-5 (Winfield 2, Brunt 0) Brunt considered paddling the first ball of her afternoon but pulled out of it. She isn\u2019t able to beat the field to get off the mark. One wicket and one run from the Wareham over, her figures now 2/12 from three. Tip top. A gentle return catch, taken with ease by the leggie. The England captain danced at her but didn\u2019t quite get to the pitch, checking a drive but only only managing to give catching practice. 13th over: England 79-4 (Knight 17, Winfield 1) Winfield is off the mark first ball to midwicket. She was good the other night after coming in for Sarah Taylor. Usually an opener, of course. Nothing left to chance by Jonassen, bowling Beaumont. She misses a reverse sweep, nutmegged. The delivery was fuller and quicker; the spinner might have saw her coming. Fine bowling. 12th over: England 74-3 (Beaumont 42, Knight 14) Mooney drops another off Beaumont! It\u2019s a tougher than the previous over, above her head on the circle at mid on, but she got both hands to it. Earlier in the set, Knight nearly did exactly the same thing, only just clearing the Queenslander in that position. Of course, she\u2019s a wicketkeeper at domestic level but plays in the Australian team as a specialist bat. Eight from it, giving England something of a platform. 11th over: England 66-3 (Beaumont 37, Knight 11) DROPPED! Mooney took a fantastic snaffle earlier but has put down an easy one here, Beaumont the recipient of the life after chipping Kimmince to long-on at a very catchable height. The all-rounder had a good shout against Beaumont for leg before in her first over, too. But she survives. It\u2019s still a good over for Lanning\u2019s side, only four added. 10th over: England 62-3 (Beaumont 35, Knight 9) Beaumont is well enough set that she is happy to take on Molineux and does it really well twice in a row, dancing to punch the spinner over her head then flicking her just as effectively over midwicket for four more. 9th over: England 51-3 (Beaumont 25, Knight 8) Ooooh! Knight was run out on Friday and so nearly again here. Haynes has a great arm but the throw from short third isn\u2019t on target at the non-strikers\u2019 end. After the dicey moment to begin it is a prodcutive over, finished off with a well-timed cut by the captain for four. They need her here. 8th over: England 43-3 (Beaumont 23, Knight 2) After watching a couple to begin, Knight gets off the mark with a sweep to midwicket, two further singles exchanged on the posh side to finish the successful Wareham over. She\u2019s a very good cricketer. Sciver bowled around her front pad! The legspinner Wareham gets a wicket first ball. The England all-rounder went across her stumps in an effort to paddle past fine leg but got cramped and missed the ball. 7th over: England 40-2 (Beaumont 22, Sciver 8) Schutt is so hard to get away with her natural movement and changes of pace. In turn, both Sciver and Beaumont are happy to focus on turning the strike over, collecting five risk-free singles. Better batting now. 6th over: England 35-2 (Beaumont 20, Sciver 5) Good batting from Beaumont, middling Jonnasen over mid-on for a once-bounce four to end the power play on a positive note. Four singles along with that four makes eight from the over, England\u2019s most convincing so far. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Hello David Langlois. \u201cDo you think Elysse Perry gets quite the credit she deserves?. Where is there a more versatile or effective sportsperson on the planet? They day she wins SPOTY overseas sports personality of the year I\u2019ll begin believing her incredible achievements are recognised in England (it\u2019s not going to happen, but it should).\u201d In Australia, she is absolutely a household name. But that hasn\u2019t been by accident. The investment made in putting women\u2019s cricket on free TV over the last four summers is really paying off. 5th over: England 27-2 (Beaumont 14, Sciver 3) The squeeze is already on. Molineux is straight where she needs to be, just four runs taken out to the sweeper at cover but without threatening the rope. Jonassen is into the book with the final ball of an excellent first over, getting rid of Wyatt. The punchy opener danced at her in an effort to plonk it over long-on but didn\u2019t get much of it, wonderfully taken by Mooney running back with the flight of the ball. Perfect technique. 4th over: England 23-2 (Beaumont 13) 3rd over: England 22-1 (Wyatt 9, Beaumont 12) Buzzers! Did we call overthrows that before David Lloyd? Not to worry; England has four of them with Wareham taking a ping at Beaumont\u2019s end from cover but it spills away to the rope. Australia won\u2019t mind that - the young spinner did execute a fine run out in the World T20 final last year, Mel Jones reminds me on TV. Earlier in the Perry set, Beaumont played the shot of the day so far, crunching past point. This was the ground where the pocket rocket made the first of her three international centuries last summer, earning a Wisden gong. 2nd over: England 11-1 (Wyatt 8, Beaumont 2) Four more off the edge! This time Wyatt is trying to deflect behind point but it flies through second slip. An top first over from Australia\u2019s swing master. 1st over: England 6-1 (Wyatt 4, Beaumont 1) After a legside wide to begin before the wicket, Beaumont gets the board moving via the bat with one to long leg. Wyatt too with an edge that would have gone straight to first slip if Perry had one! Perfect outswinging delivery; deserved a second scalp not four runs. \u201cWhere\u2019s the slip?\u201d asks Mel Jones on television. With all that movement, it\u2019s a good question. The hold Perry has on Jones! She has her again. It is a dreadful shot too, gifting a limp catch to cover point. The fourth time she has picked her up in the series. No footwork. Horrible cricket. The players are on the field. This series has been such a massive mismatch since the opening exchanges, England winning about five of the 50 hours played thereafter. Let\u2019s hope that by batting first here at Hove today, the hosts get a big competitive total and we have ourselves an interesting afternoon. Wyatt and Jones are opening for England, Perry taking the first over with the ball. PLAY! The restructure. There has been a lot of debate since England lost the Ashes about what women\u2019s cricket is going to look like in this country as of next summer, when the new domestic plan kicks in. The ECB\u2019s women\u2019s cricket supremo, Clare Connor, has been on TMS and Sky TV before play talking about this very topic. I\u2019ll get those comments to you as soon as they appear on the wires, et al. Let\u2019s talk, by the way. Email, twitter - you know the drill. Confirmation from the England camp that Shrubsole was left out, not injured. That\u2019s a big call but she hasn\u2019t been at her best. Have a read of Megan Schutt\u2019s column. She\u2019s a gem. It makes complete sense to me that we become a republic. In doing so, I hope Australia can move forward in a whole range of areas, especially the way we officially appreciate our Indigenous history. It\u2019s just ridiculous to me that we have a union jack on our flag but no reference to our Aboriginal people, and the date of Australia Day has to change. Australia: Alyssa Healy (wk), Beth Mooney, Meg Lanning (c), Ashleigh Gardner, Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Sophie Molineux, Jess Jonassen, Georgia Wareham, Delissa Kimmince, Megan Schutt. England: Danni Wyatt, Amy Jones (wk), Tammy Beaumont, Nat Sciver, Heather Knight (c), Georgia Elwiss, Lauren Winfield, Katherine Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Laura Marsh, Kate Cross. That will be a relief for Heather Knight, the home skipper. The big news from the middle is that England\u2019s vice-captain, Anya Shrubsole, has been left out of the playing XI. Of course, she had 50 taken from her three overs during Lanning\u2019s masterclass on Friday. Australia, as we expected, are unchanged. We\u2019re in Brighton for the weekend! Well, strictly speaking we\u2019re in Hove for Sunday afternoon but we\u2019re happy all the same. It\u2019s muggy and sticky and the track looks a road. After Australia\u2019s utterly dominant 93-run triumph in the first rubber on Friday, they have an unbeatable 10-2 points lead but England can still win these T20s as they did in the corredponding series in November 2017. I\u2019ll be back with the toss and the teams in a tick. Good afternoon!",

      "body": "<p>A year ago, as Egan Bernal matched the pace of Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas in the Tour de France \u2013 and left many of its big names trailing in the mountains \u2013 the 21-year-old Colombian was instantly tipped as a future Tour winner. A curious trail of fortuitous events has now propelled him to overnight stardom as his country\u2019s first Tour de France winner and made him the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/28/tour-de-france-ineos-name-thomas-and-bernal-as-joint-team-leaders\" title=\"\">probable leader</a> of the world\u2019s most successful cycling team \u2013 Ineos \u2013 for years to come.</p> \n<p>Had things gone to plan, Bernal would have led Ineos at the Giro d\u2019Italia after taking a crushing win in the first major stage race of 2019, Paris-Nice. Instead a training crash sidelined him with a broken collarbone and he was pencilled in for the Tour de France. The withdrawal of the four-times winner, Froome, left a gap alongside the defending champion, Thomas, in the Ineos hierarchy and, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/18/geraint-thomas-abandons-tour-de-suisse-after-heavy-crash-on-stage-four\" title=\"\">Thomas fell off at the Tour of Switzerland</a> in June, up stepped Bernal to take the third major stage race of his career.</p> \n<p>If there is any surprise at Bernal\u2019s victory, it is that it has taken so long for a Colombian to win the Tour. It is 44 years since Cochise Rodr\u00edguez finished the race alongside Felice Gimondi and it was 1983 when Colombians arrived en masse; a year later Luis \u201cEl Jardinerito\u201d Herrera won the legendary stage finish at L\u2019Alpe d\u2019Huez and by the late 1980s there were two Colombian teams in the race, with Fabio Parra finishing on the podium in 1988.</p> \n<p>Bernal is directly in that line, along with Oliverio Rinc\u00f3n, a stage winner in Andorra in 1993, and Victor-Hugo Pe\u00f1a, a yellow-jersey holder in 2003. He hails from the town of Zipaquir\u00e1, 30km outside Bogota and a town known for its salt industry; a cathedral built 200m underground inside one of the mines is a major tourist attraction. The town is 2,700m above sea-level; the pass leading from Zipaquir\u00e1 to his mother\u2019s home town, Pacho, tops out at 3,600m. According to his mother, Florites, young Egan set himself the target of getting there inside one hour and he would be capable of winning the Tour de France; he managed it in 56 minutes this spring.</p> \n<p>Bernal began riding a mountain bike at seven years old; his father, Germ\u00e1n, had been deprived of a possible cycling career because the family\u2019s lack of resources meant he had to go out to work. In an attempt to discourage his son from following in his footsteps he sent him on long trips on his cousin\u2019s heavy bike but, according to his mother, that simply whetted his appetite.</p> \n<p>As a junior he managed silver and bronze medals at the world championships; that drew the attention of the Italian talent scout Gianni Savio, a dapper little man and a fixture on the pro circuit since the 1980s, who runs the small-budget Androni Giocattoli team. On the strength of one test and a trip to Italy Savio secured Bernal on a four-year contract; under Savio Bernal finished fourth in the Tour de l\u2019Avenir, the under-23 \u201cmini Tour de France\u201d, in 2016.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/28/blood-rain-and-cheers-tour-de-france-2019-in-pictures\">Blood, rain and cheers: Tour de France 2019 \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A year later he won the Avenir and Team Sky bought him out of his deal with Savio. Since then his rise has been meteoric. In his debut World Tour race, at the Tour Down Under, he finished sixth. He followed that with wins in the Tour of Colombia and a time-trial stage in the Tour de Romandie where he took the scalp of Primoz Roglic. En route to overall victory at the Tour of California he defeated Adam Yates in one of his two mountain stage wins.</p> \n<p>In his debut Tour he finished 15th and not surprisingly he was rapidly put on a five-year deal rumoured to be worth \u00a312m. \u201cI\u2019ve searched and searched for the rider that might be the next Chris Froome, who would be our next big leader for Grand Tours,\u201d said the Sky, now Ineos, chief, Dave Brailsford. \u201cMy choice was Bernal.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if inspired is the right word but just being around him \u2013 I\u2019m two years older than him but it\u2019s like being with a big champion,\u201d his teammate Tao Geoghegan Hart said in a 2018 interview with the website <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com\" title=\"\">cyclingtips.com</a> . \u201cJust the care he takes with everything.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bernal has gained a reputation for being calm, equable, a rider who does not look for excuses when things go wrong.

      "bodyText": "A year ago, as Egan Bernal matched the pace of Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas in the Tour de France \u2013 and left many of its big names trailing in the mountains \u2013 the 21-year-old Colombian was instantly tipped as a future Tour winner. A curious trail of fortuitous events has now propelled him to overnight stardom as his country\u2019s first Tour de France winner and made him the probable leader of the world\u2019s most successful cycling team \u2013 Ineos \u2013 for years to come. Had things gone to plan, Bernal would have led Ineos at the Giro d\u2019Italia after taking a crushing win in the first major stage race of 2019, Paris-Nice. Instead a training crash sidelined him with a broken collarbone and he was pencilled in for the Tour de France. The withdrawal of the four-times winner, Froome, left a gap alongside the defending champion, Thomas, in the Ineos hierarchy and, when Thomas fell off at the Tour of Switzerland in June, up stepped Bernal to take the third major stage race of his career. If there is any surprise at Bernal\u2019s victory, it is that it has taken so long for a Colombian to win the Tour. It is 44 years since Cochise Rodr\u00edguez finished the race alongside Felice Gimondi and it was 1983 when Colombians arrived en masse; a year later Luis \u201cEl Jardinerito\u201d Herrera won the legendary stage finish at L\u2019Alpe d\u2019Huez and by the late 1980s there were two Colombian teams in the race, with Fabio Parra finishing on the podium in 1988. Bernal is directly in that line, along with Oliverio Rinc\u00f3n, a stage winner in Andorra in 1993, and Victor-Hugo Pe\u00f1a, a yellow-jersey holder in 2003. He hails from the town of Zipaquir\u00e1, 30km outside Bogota and a town known for its salt industry; a cathedral built 200m underground inside one of the mines is a major tourist attraction. The town is 2,700m above sea-level; the pass leading from Zipaquir\u00e1 to his mother\u2019s home town, Pacho, tops out at 3,600m. According to his mother, Florites, young Egan set himself the target of getting there inside one hour and he would be capable of winning the Tour de France; he managed it in 56 minutes this spring. Bernal began riding a mountain bike at seven years old; his father, Germ\u00e1n, had been deprived of a possible cycling career because the family\u2019s lack of resources meant he had to go out to work. In an attempt to discourage his son from following in his footsteps he sent him on long trips on his cousin\u2019s heavy bike but, according to his mother, that simply whetted his appetite. As a junior he managed silver and bronze medals at the world championships; that drew the attention of the Italian talent scout Gianni Savio, a dapper little man and a fixture on the pro circuit since the 1980s, who runs the small-budget Androni Giocattoli team. On the strength of one test and a trip to Italy Savio secured Bernal on a four-year contract; under Savio Bernal finished fourth in the Tour de l\u2019Avenir, the under-23 \u201cmini Tour de France\u201d, in 2016. A year later he won the Avenir and Team Sky bought him out of his deal with Savio. Since then his rise has been meteoric. In his debut World Tour race, at the Tour Down Under, he finished sixth. He followed that with wins in the Tour of Colombia and a time-trial stage in the Tour de Romandie where he took the scalp of Primoz Roglic. En route to overall victory at the Tour of California he defeated Adam Yates in one of his two mountain stage wins. In his debut Tour he finished 15th and not surprisingly he was rapidly put on a five-year deal rumoured to be worth \u00a312m. \u201cI\u2019ve searched and searched for the rider that might be the next Chris Froome, who would be our next big leader for Grand Tours,\u201d said the Sky, now Ineos, chief, Dave Brailsford. \u201cMy choice was Bernal.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if inspired is the right word but just being around him \u2013 I\u2019m two years older than him but it\u2019s like being with a big champion,\u201d his teammate Tao Geoghegan Hart said in a 2018 interview with the website cyclingtips.com . \u201cJust the care he takes with everything.\u201d Bernal has gained a reputation for being calm, equable, a rider who does not look for excuses when things go wrong. He learned Italian in six months, to enable him to communicate at Androni, and English in another six after being signed by Sky. That points to a man who may adapt better than most of his compatriots to racing in a continent away from home. The consensus is that Bernal will win multiple Tours de France, having shown such promise at such a tender age. It is certainly true that many of cycling\u2019s greatest champions won the Tour at a relatively young age \u2013 Merckx, Hinault, Anquetil \u2013 but the equation is more complex than it seems, however blatant Bernal\u2019s talent may be at this stage. He has two weaknesses; he seems to crash more often than he should and he still has the occasional off-day \u2013 in the Tour it came in the time trial at Pau. The last precocious youngster to top the Tour podium, Jan Ullrich in 1997, was a year older than Bernal, and, like the Colombian, won the Tour ahead of a teammate, Bjarne Riis, who also happened to be the previous year\u2019s winner. As with Bernal, Ullrich was instantly hailed as the man who would dominate the Tour for years to come. Speculation about Bernal\u2019s future may seem premature; better to celebrate his win for what it is right now.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cHow can wealth persuade poverty to use its political freedom to keep wealth in power? Here lies the whole art of Conservative politics in the 20th century.\u201d</p> <p>Those words were written by the Labour hero <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1948/jul/05/leadersandreply.mainsection\" title=\"\">Aneurin Bevan</a>, seven years after the end of the second world war and a decade before the arrival of the Beatles, but their power endures. Indeed, the imminence of Brexit and the entry into Downing Street of yet another moneyed Old Etonian prompts much the same question, though Britain\u2019s current circumstances demand that it should be slightly rephrased. So, let us turn to the Irish writer Fintan O\u2019Toole\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/16/brexit-paranoid-fantasy-fintan-otoole\" title=\"\">Heroic Failure</a>, which updates Bevan\u2019s point.</p> <p>\u201cThe great mystery of Brexit is the bond it created between working-class revolt on the one side and upper-class self-indulgence on the other,\u201d writes O\u2019Toole. What, he wonders, could have possibly glued together \u201cstockbroker superciliousness\u201d and \u201cthe raw two-fingered defiance of working-class patriotism\u201d?</p> <p>The answer is the spirit of punk, or something like it. \u201cOne great binding agent was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/13/punk-1976-1978-british-library-40th-anniversary-sex-pistols-buzzcocks\" title=\"\">Anarchy in the UK</a>, the sheer joy of being able to fuck everything up,\u201d he writes. As Boris Johnson proves, the Brexit instinct is at least partly about outrage for outrage\u2019s sake \u2013 the kind of sensibility whose most vivid cultural manifestation was in the brazen provocations of punk rock (appropriately enough John Lydon \u2013 AKA Johnny Rotten \u2013 supports our exit from the EU). Led by a serial smasher-upper and self-publicist, we are on our way out of the EU because of a collective set of desires akin to the punk-era urge to break things, along with a connected inability to channel resentment into anything more than gestures of self-harm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/28/boris-johnson-turbo-charging-no-deal-brexit-plans-say-ministers\">Boris Johnson \u2018turbo-charging\u2019 no-deal Brexit plans, say ministers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To go much further back into English history, it could be argued that Johnson is also channelling a kind of cavalier spirit. Popular history recalls those 17th-century defenders of monarchy and privilege as \u2013 to quote the Encyclopedia Britannica \u2013 \u201cswashbuckling\u201d and \u201coverbearing\u201d. Like them, Johnson wants us to think of him as an opponent of dour Puritanism and the bringer of the kind of joy that one supportive newspaper groaningly calls \u201cJohnsun\u201d. Many of the new prime minister\u2019s past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/19/held-captive-by-his-carers-for-four-weeks-lets-look-at-boris-johnsons-best-bits\" title=\"\">stunts and outbursts</a> have served the cause of contrasting himself with supposedly grey, technocratic, orthodox politicians, and thereby feeding his own romantic myth (a myth is all it is, of course: there is no more dull and conventional path to power in this country than one that begins at Eton, passes through Oxford, and then ends at Westminster). </p> <p>Myth-making and politics as performance are now delivering the keys to high office across western democracies. If politics has long intersected with the world of showbusiness, the 21st century has so blurred the two that they often seem to be one and the same. The president of the United States of America, as you may have noticed, does not derive his popularity from any conventional notion of substantive achievement, but instead from a daily pantomime of boasting and nastiness that keeps his supporters in the required state of excitement. Italy and now Ukraine have seen the rise of politicians who actually used to be comedians; in the latter, the latest development is the launch of a new anti-establishment party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/ukraine-election-rock-star-set-for-coalition-talks-with-comedian-turned-president\" title=\"\">led by a rock star</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a310b019f55f30358437f6d6db36c3291b169ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a310b019f55f30358437f6d6db36c3291b169ba2/0_104_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Lydon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018John Lydon \u2013 AKA Johnny Rotten \u2013 supports our exit from the EU.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These developments seem to me to be rooted in two things: the fact that post-1979 neoliberalism has stripped traditional politicians of much of their power, often threatening to reduce politics and statecraft to mere gesture; and that governments have largely failed to tackle most of the issues of our age, from the climate emergency to the drastic challenges of automation.</p> <p>An opening has thus appeared for people who at least affect \u2013 and with Johnson, affectation is all \u2013 to reject the basic norms of politics as usual. As the Trump experience has proved, even questions of deceit can bounce off them: if lying is part of a nihilistic, provocative persona, then having a distant relationship with the truth is all part of the act. This, perhaps, is how you end up with a prime minister who will not confirm how many children he has, who serially makes things up about the EU, and who does not just have a reputation for barely being able to tie his own shoelaces, but actively trades on it.</p> <p>When the Labour party attacks him because he \u201chas no plan\u201d to deal with Britain\u2019s fundamental problems, it speaks a self-evident truth. But a lack of prudence, coherence and basic seriousness seems to be the basis of Johnson\u2019s personal brand. Besides, is his apparent policy platform \u2013 money splurged here and there and free-market business as usual \u2013 any less credible that the programmes offered by just about every UK government this century?</p> <p>Then there is his taste for ugly rhetoric designed to ensure that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/boris-johnson-five-things-we-learned-from-leadership-launch\" title=\"\">the plaster comes off the ceiling</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This is an increasingly familiar populist trick: encouraging a set of voters to relish taboo-busting as a kind of surrogate for a lost sense of economic agency and power. This version of taking back control is not to do with jobs, wages or houses, but the licence to say anything you want, whatever the consequences.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHow can wealth persuade poverty to use its political freedom to keep wealth in power? Here lies the whole art of Conservative politics in the 20th century.\u201d Those words were written by the Labour hero Aneurin Bevan, seven years after the end of the second world war and a decade before the arrival of the Beatles, but their power endures. Indeed, the imminence of Brexit and the entry into Downing Street of yet another moneyed Old Etonian prompts much the same question, though Britain\u2019s current circumstances demand that it should be slightly rephrased. So, let us turn to the Irish writer Fintan O\u2019Toole\u2019s book Heroic Failure, which updates Bevan\u2019s point. \u201cThe great mystery of Brexit is the bond it created between working-class revolt on the one side and upper-class self-indulgence on the other,\u201d writes O\u2019Toole. What, he wonders, could have possibly glued together \u201cstockbroker superciliousness\u201d and \u201cthe raw two-fingered defiance of working-class patriotism\u201d? The answer is the spirit of punk, or something like it. \u201cOne great binding agent was Anarchy in the UK, the sheer joy of being able to fuck everything up,\u201d he writes. As Boris Johnson proves, the Brexit instinct is at least partly about outrage for outrage\u2019s sake \u2013 the kind of sensibility whose most vivid cultural manifestation was in the brazen provocations of punk rock (appropriately enough John Lydon \u2013 AKA Johnny Rotten \u2013 supports our exit from the EU). Led by a serial smasher-upper and self-publicist, we are on our way out of the EU because of a collective set of desires akin to the punk-era urge to break things, along with a connected inability to channel resentment into anything more than gestures of self-harm. To go much further back into English history, it could be argued that Johnson is also channelling a kind of cavalier spirit. Popular history recalls those 17th-century defenders of monarchy and privilege as \u2013 to quote the Encyclopedia Britannica \u2013 \u201cswashbuckling\u201d and \u201coverbearing\u201d. Like them, Johnson wants us to think of him as an opponent of dour Puritanism and the bringer of the kind of joy that one supportive newspaper groaningly calls \u201cJohnsun\u201d. Many of the new prime minister\u2019s past stunts and outbursts have served the cause of contrasting himself with supposedly grey, technocratic, orthodox politicians, and thereby feeding his own romantic myth (a myth is all it is, of course: there is no more dull and conventional path to power in this country than one that begins at Eton, passes through Oxford, and then ends at Westminster). Myth-making and politics as performance are now delivering the keys to high office across western democracies. If politics has long intersected with the world of showbusiness, the 21st century has so blurred the two that they often seem to be one and the same. The president of the United States of America, as you may have noticed, does not derive his popularity from any conventional notion of substantive achievement, but instead from a daily pantomime of boasting and nastiness that keeps his supporters in the required state of excitement. Italy and now Ukraine have seen the rise of politicians who actually used to be comedians; in the latter, the latest development is the launch of a new anti-establishment party led by a rock star. These developments seem to me to be rooted in two things: the fact that post-1979 neoliberalism has stripped traditional politicians of much of their power, often threatening to reduce politics and statecraft to mere gesture; and that governments have largely failed to tackle most of the issues of our age, from the climate emergency to the drastic challenges of automation. An opening has thus appeared for people who at least affect \u2013 and with Johnson, affectation is all \u2013 to reject the basic norms of politics as usual. As the Trump experience has proved, even questions of deceit can bounce off them: if lying is part of a nihilistic, provocative persona, then having a distant relationship with the truth is all part of the act. This, perhaps, is how you end up with a prime minister who will not confirm how many children he has, who serially makes things up about the EU, and who does not just have a reputation for barely being able to tie his own shoelaces, but actively trades on it. When the Labour party attacks him because he \u201chas no plan\u201d to deal with Britain\u2019s fundamental problems, it speaks a self-evident truth. But a lack of prudence, coherence and basic seriousness seems to be the basis of Johnson\u2019s personal brand. Besides, is his apparent policy platform \u2013 money splurged here and there and free-market business as usual \u2013 any less credible that the programmes offered by just about every UK government this century? Then there is his taste for ugly rhetoric designed to ensure that \u201cthe plaster comes off the ceiling\u201d. This is an increasingly familiar populist trick: encouraging a set of voters to relish taboo-busting as a kind of surrogate for a lost sense of economic agency and power. This version of taking back control is not to do with jobs, wages or houses, but the licence to say anything you want, whatever the consequences. Anyone who is offended is dismissed as a puritanical defender of joyless political correctness. Punk spirit, cavalier style and wilful provocation will all inform the manner in which Johnson and his allies frame their greatest challenge of all: how on earth to deal with the very real crisis of Brexit and honour the Halloween deadline that the Tory party has so stupidly fetishised. And they look set to play a crucial role in gaining consent from those who have most to lose from crashing out of the EU. Faced with a set of impossible challenges, Johnson will present himself as the flamboyant, verbose, rule-breaking Englishman, positioned against the washed-out logicians of the EU machine, who were never going to help in the first place. Whether this approach could survive the sudden appearance of expensive food, empty shelves and queues of lorries is an interesting question. It would take an amazingly mould-breaking politician to ride this out, and Johnson is a lot less mould-breaking than he would like us to think. But in the midst of all that talk about a quickfire election and given deep-rooted English cultural traits and the strange, hallucinatory times in which we live, I would not underestimate his appeal.

      "bodyText": "Phillip Cocu played at Pride Park on 10 August 2001 in a routine pre-season friendly victory over Derby with Barcelona when Patrick Kluivert scored twice. Fast\u2011forward almost two decades and it is a stadium Cocu now calls home after replacing Frank Lampard in the Derby dugout. Cocu won seven league titles at PSV Eindhoven (four as captain and three in five years as a manager) but a burgeoning reputation as a coach was dented by a disastrous 98-day reign at Fenerbah\u00e7e last year.

Utilities across the country are pushing to delay climate action and stall the growth of renewables, which are<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/25/business/coal-solar-wind-renewable-energy/index.html\"> already a cheaper source of electricity</a> than continuing to operate three-quarters of US coal plants.</p> <p>Last week in Florida, the CEO of an electric utility called for large charges on customer bills in order to make solar customers \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FloridaMunicipalPowerAgency/videos/631848114005461/\">go away</a>\u201d. The Sunshine State gets a measly 3% of its electricity from renewables.

Once its favored politicians took office, the utility succeeded in rolling back solar policies.</p> <p>These same electric utilities have <a href=\"https://www.energyandpolicy.org/utilities-knew-about-climate-change/\">funded climate denial for decades</a>. Now they\u2019ve moved on to delay: more than half the country\u2019s highest-emitting utilities are <a href=\"https://www.energyandpolicy.org/utility-carbon-targets/\">slow-walking</a> their own plans to decarbonize over the next decade. Some major utilities have zero plan to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>When a private electric utility chooses to spend its guaranteed profits on denial or delay, the public cannot choose to stop buying its power. There is no exit from a monopoly.</p> <p>In the Ohio case, these utilities started their attacks on renewables in 2011. By 2014, the state had frozen its clean energy targets and made it nearly impossible to build wind energy. This latest change will erode what little policy is left. The law will eliminate clean energy targets and gut an energy efficiency program that has <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/ohio-house-passes-controversial-energy-bill-vote/pUPecUHOFeTT6sjP6XN5GP/\">saved the state $5</a><a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/ohio-house-passes-controversial-energy-bill-vote/pUPecUHOFeTT6sjP6XN5GP/\">bn</a> \u2013 instead cementing Ohio\u2019s position at the bottom of national clean energy rankings. With only 2.5% of its electricity from renewable energy sources last year, the state is in 49th place.</p> <p>In a truly Orwellian doublespeak, Ohio\u2019s latest policy is called the Clean Air Program. The lawmakers don\u2019t even have the guts to call the law what it is \u2013 a coal plant subsidy \u2013 and instead refer to these dirty sources as \u201clegacy assets\u201d.</p> <p>Some advocates have focused on the parts of the bill that would subsidize nuclear, and the legislation\u2019s small offerings for solar \u2013 both carbon-free sources of power. Yet the bill provides almost twice as much funding for coal as clean energy.</p> <p>This is all occurring as Ohio bakes in another heatwave. As farmers throughout the state struggle to plant crops under record rainfall and flooding. As poor communities surrounding these coal plants continue to breathe toxic air.</p> <p>The climate crisis is on Ohio\u2019s doorstep. Yet the corporations running these ancient coal plants want to keep them operating until 2040, when they will be 85 years old. These plants are long past retirement age.</p> <p>The next time you feel that you are to blame for climate change \u2013 because you forgot to hit the light switch, or you took that flight to see your ailing mother \u2013 remember the Ohio electric utilities and their coal subsidies. Remember the politicians who gave them this billion-dollar bailout after receiving <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/2018/04/firstenergy_pac_writes_big_che.html\">personal favors</a>, like a flight to Trump\u2019s inauguration on a corporate jet. And know that one day after signing this bill, Ohio Governor DeWine attended a Trump fundraiser <a href=\"https://documented.net/2019/07/15/murray-energy-ceo-to-host-trump-fundraiser/\">hosted</a> by coal baron Bob Murray.</p> <p>Fighting the climate crisis is not about purifying yourself. It\u2019s about dismantling corporate power.

The law will eliminate clean energy targets and gut an energy efficiency program that has saved the state $5bn \u2013 instead cementing Ohio\u2019s position at the bottom of national clean energy rankings. With only 2.5% of its electricity from renewable energy sources last year, the state is in 49th place. In a truly Orwellian doublespeak, Ohio\u2019s latest policy is called the Clean Air Program. The lawmakers don\u2019t even have the guts to call the law what it is \u2013 a coal plant subsidy \u2013 and instead refer to these dirty sources as \u201clegacy assets\u201d. Some advocates have focused on the parts of the bill that would subsidize nuclear, and the legislation\u2019s small offerings for solar \u2013 both carbon-free sources of power. Yet the bill provides almost twice as much funding for coal as clean energy. This is all occurring as Ohio bakes in another heatwave. As farmers throughout the state struggle to plant crops under record rainfall and flooding. As poor communities surrounding these coal plants continue to breathe toxic air. The climate crisis is on Ohio\u2019s doorstep. Yet the corporations running these ancient coal plants want to keep them operating until 2040, when they will be 85 years old. These plants are long past retirement age. The next time you feel that you are to blame for climate change \u2013 because you forgot to hit the light switch, or you took that flight to see your ailing mother \u2013 remember the Ohio electric utilities and their coal subsidies. Remember the politicians who gave them this billion-dollar bailout after receiving personal favors, like a flight to Trump\u2019s inauguration on a corporate jet. And know that one day after signing this bill, Ohio Governor DeWine attended a Trump fundraiser hosted by coal baron Bob Murray. Fighting the climate crisis is not about purifying yourself. It\u2019s about dismantling corporate power. Electric utilities are a great place to start.

      "bodyText": "The British aerospace industry has stepped up plans for a Brexit exodus from the UK aviation regulator, as a second deadline for the UK leaving the EU without a deal looms. More than 600 British aerospace firms have now applied to be regulated in Europe as third-country parties under a scheme for companies seeking access to the single market in case of a no-deal Brexit. The scheme opened in October. The UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) gives regulatory approval for British-made parts to be used throughout the EU, but that ability will lapse if the UK leaves without a deal. The number of applications by UK firms for EU authorisation to cover themselves for a no-deal Brexit has tripled between December and July. In December 2018, the Guardian revealed that only 200 UK aerospace manufacturers had applied to come under the jurisdiction of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as third-country parties, suggesting many firms would not have been prepared for a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. Manufacturers which have not received authorisations from the EASA or other European aviation authorities would be unable to sell new parts to European customers, dealing a potentially crippling blow to many UK exporters. The latest total of applications submitted by UK firms to the EASA for third-country certificates is 636, according to European commission sources, while about 10 more are in the process of completing their applications, almost four months after the date when the UK was first scheduled to leave the EU. The aerospace lobby group ADS estimates that about 800 companies will eventually need new regulatory arrangements under a no-deal Brexit. While the regulatory changes do not involve major job moves out of the UK, industry insiders said it could contribute towards making the UK less attractive for future inward investment. If the UK leaves the EU with a deal the EASA applications will immediately lapse, as CAA approvals will continue to be valid across Europe. British manufacturers Rolls-Royce, Cobham and Meggitt are among the 636 businesses that have applied to the EASA. Canada\u2019s Bombardier and the US company GE Aviation, which both have significant operations in the UK, have also applied. The UK narrowly avoided leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March after the EU agreed to extend the negotiating period, following the then prime minister Theresa May\u2019s repeated failures to pass her withdrawal bill. The aerospace industry has been among the most forthright in its opposition to leaving the UK without a deal. Airbus, Europe\u2019s largest aerospace company, has warned it will consider closing British factories in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

She pulls up two red plastic chairs and sits herself down on one, her laptop open on her knees. The videos are part of an edgy multimedia tribute to Kathy Acker that sprawls across the ICA\u2019s lower floors. Valk is here to add a final theatrical flourish, directing a previously unstaged script by the pirate queen of 70s and 80s counterculture.

He cites a 2018 study that tracked participants\u2019 activity levels and personality traits over 20 years, and found that those who moved the least showed malign personality changes, scoring lower in the positive traits: openness, extraversion and agreeableness. There is substantial data showing that walkers have lower rates of depression, too. And we know, says O\u2019Mara, \u201cfrom the scientific literature, that getting people to engage in physical activity before they engage in a creative act is very powerful. My notion \u2013 and we need to test this \u2013 is that the activation that occurs across the whole of the brain during problem-solving becomes much greater almost as an accident of walking demanding lots of neural resources.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Mara\u2019s enthusiasm for walking ties in with both of his main interests as a professor of experimental brain research: stress, depression and anxiety; and learning, memory and cognition. \u201cIt turns out that the brain systems that support learning, memory and cognition are the same ones that are very badly affected by stress and depression,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd by a quirk of evolution, these brain systems also support functions such as cognitive mapping,\u201d by which he means our internal GPS system. But these aren\u2019t the only overlaps between movement and mental and cognitive health that neuroscience has identified.</p> <p>I witnessed the brain-healing effects of walking when my partner was recovering from an acute brain injury. His mind was often unsettled, but during our evening strolls through east London, things started to make more sense and conversation flowed easily. O\u2019Mara nods knowingly. \u201cYou\u2019re walking rhythmically together,\u201d he says, \u201cand there are all sorts of rhythms happening in the brain as a result of engaging in that kind of activity, and they\u2019re absent when you\u2019re sitting. One of the great overlooked superpowers we have is that, when we get up and walk, our senses are sharpened. Rhythms that would previously be quiet suddenly come to life, and the way our brain interacts with our body changes.\u201d</p> <p>From the scant data available on walking and brain injury, says O\u2019Mara, \u201cit is reasonable to surmise that supervised walking may help with acquired brain injury, depending on the nature, type and extent of injury \u2013 perhaps by promoting blood flow, and perhaps also through the effect of entraining various electrical rhythms in the brain. And perhaps by engaging in systematic dual tasking, such as talking and walking.\u201d</p> <p>One such rhythm, he says, is that of theta brainwaves. Theta is a pulse or frequency (seven to eight hertz, to be precise) which, says O\u2019Mara, \u201cyou can detect all over the brain during the course of movement, and it has all sorts of wonderful effects in terms of assisting learning and memory, and those kinds of things\u201d. Theta cranks up when we move around because it is needed for spatial learning, and O\u2019Mara suspects that walking is the best movement for such learning. \u201cThe timescales that walking affords us are the ones we evolved with,\u201d he writes, \u201cand in which information pickup from the environment most easily occurs.\u201d</p> <p>Essential brain-nourishing molecules are produced by aerobically demanding activity, too. You\u2019ll get raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which, writes O\u2019Mara, \u201ccould be thought of as a kind of a molecular fertiliser produced within the brain because it supports structural remodelling and growth of synapses after learning \u2026 BDNF increases resilience to ageing, and damage caused by trauma or infection.\u201d Then there\u2019s vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which helps to grow the network of blood vessels carrying oxygen and nutrients to brain cells.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Robots can\u2019t do this.

The second time, not quite so much and, by the third or fourth time, you don\u2019t need the GPS at all, because you\u2019ve learned the route.

      "bodyText": "Taking a stroll with Shane O\u2019Mara is a risky endeavour. The neuroscientist is so passionate about walking, and our collective right to go for walks, that he is determined not to let the slightest unfortunate aspect of urban design break his stride. So much so, that he has a habit of darting across busy roads as the lights change. \u201cOne of life\u2019s great horrors as you\u2019re walking is waiting for permission to cross the street,\u201d he tells me, when we are forced to stop for traffic \u2013 a rude interruption when, as he says, \u201cthe experience of synchrony when walking together is one of life\u2019s great pleasures\u201d. He knows this not only through personal experience, but from cold, hard data \u2013 walking makes us healthier, happier and brainier. We are wandering the streets of Dublin discussing O\u2019Mara\u2019s new book, In Praise of Walking, a backstage tour of what happens in our brains while we perambulate. Our jaunt begins at the grand old gates of his workplace, Trinity College, and takes in the Irish famine memorial at St Stephen\u2019s Green, the Georgian mile, the birthplace of Francis Bacon, the site of Facebook\u2019s new European mega-HQ and the salubrious seaside dwellings of Sandymount. O\u2019Mara, 53, is in his element striding through urban landscapes \u2013 from epic hikes across London\u2019s sprawl to more sedate ambles in Oxford, where he received his DPhil \u2013 and waxing lyrical about science, nature, architecture and literature. He favours what he calls a \u201cmotor-centric\u201d view of the brain \u2013 that it evolved to support movement and, therefore, if we stop moving about, it won\u2019t work as well. This is neatly illustrated by the life cycle of the humble sea squirt which, in its adult form, is a marine invertebrate found clinging to rocks or boat hulls. It has no brain because it has eaten it. During its larval stage, it had a backbone, a single eye and a basic brain to enable it to swim about hunting like \u201ca small, water-dwelling, vertebrate cyclops\u201d, as O\u2019Mara puts it. The larval sea squirt knew when it was hungry and how to move about, and it could tell up from down. But, when it fused on to a rock to start its new vegetative existence, it consumed its redundant eye, brain and spinal cord. Certain species of jellyfish, conversely, start out as brainless polyps on rocks, only developing complicated nerves that might be considered semi-brains as they become swimmers.

Witnesses said the fight erupted in the buffet area onboard P&amp;O\u2019s Britannia in the early hours of Friday morning after a day of \u201cpatriotic partying\u201d while the ship was en route to Southampton from Bergen, Norway, with passengers using furniture and plates as weapons. The ITV journalist Richard Gaisford tweeted that a witness told staff the violent confrontation ensued after one person became upset that a fellow passenger was wearing a clown outfit because they had specifically booked a cruise with no fancy dress. The Press Association reported that an entertainer working on Britannia said a clown had gatecrashed a black-tie party held in the 16th-floor restaurant, prompting anger. However, on Sunday P&amp;O Cruises said there was no clown onboard. \u201cFollowing an incident on board Britannia on Thursday evening we can confirm that all guests disembarked yesterday and the matter is now in the hands of the local police,\u201d a spokesman said, adding that P&amp;O did not tolerate disruptive behaviour. Hampshire police confirmed that they were not aware of a clown being involved in the brawl. A spokeswoman said: \u201cThere is no information to suggest that a clown or anyone wearing fancy dress was involved in this incident.\u201d Officers are still investigating reports concerning the public order incident and have appealed for information, after the arrested pair, a man, 43, and a woman, 41, both from Chigwell, Essex, were released on Sunday. Police said three men and three women were assaulted in the melee, and that a number of injuries were suffered including significant bruising and cuts. Gaisford, from the news programme Good Morning Britain, said he became aware of the incident at 2am when security were called over the emergency PA system to urgently attend the 16th-floor restaurant. He tweeted that he had been told \u201cthere was blood everywhere\u201d, with witnesses saying they were \u201cso frightened they had to hide\u201d as passengers \u201cused furniture and plates as weapons\u201d after a day of heavy alcohol consumption by many guests. \u201cOne witness, part of a group involved in the trouble, explained to staff that things kicked off when another passenger appeared dressed as a clown,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis upset one of their party because they\u2019d specifically booked a cruise with no fancy dress.

With the Chinese transfer window closing on Wednesday, Bale\u2019s hopes of sealing a move away from the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u this summer could now rest on him finding another club in Europe, with Real said to be prepared to let him join a Champions League rival for the right price.

But the main thread hangs on a rebel movement, the League of the Unverifieds, whose radical underground action prompts a crisis of conscience in a bought-off newspaper editor, David Strachey (who reported Bigman\u2019s killing as \u201csuicide by droid\u201d), while affirming the doubts of Eloise Jayne, a counterterrorist sceptical of the 21st-century sus laws she\u2019s ordered to enforce. A brainy, bustling novel, Zed is hugely enjoyable as well as hard going at times: robotic chit-chat from ubiquitous Very Intelligent Personal Assistants, as well as a blizzard of acronyms and Beetle\u2019s own Newspeak (\u201cBespoke\u201d), added to the fact that much of the firm\u2019s senior-level discussion takes place in virtual reality, or \u201cReal Virtuality\u201d (in which, for instance, \u201cthe Real Douglas Varley\u201d speaks alongside \u201cthe actually real Douglas Varley\u201d), can make for a bumpy ride. What\u2019s great about it, though, is that Kavenna uses her scenario not only for horror, but laughter, too, as a send-up of corporate hubris and government heedlessness. Beetle targets London because the UK is \u201cthe most advanced benign regulatory environment in the world\u201d; the prime minister is mentioned for the first time only a few pages from the end, and even then Kavenna says her name isn\u2019t important. As for Brexit? Compared with Beetle, or whichever voracious duosyllable it\u2019s a proxy for, it seems to be irrelevant, which may be this madcap satire\u2019s most chilling point. \u2022 Zed by Joanna Kavenna is published by Faber &amp; Faber (\u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>Central bankers rarely say anything that sticks in the memory. Mark Carney has been at the Bank of England for the past six years and is known as the rock star central banker, and not always in a good way. His answers to questions at press conferences are often like solos from the lead guitarist of a 1970s prog rock band: long and boring.</p> <p>Indeed, only two central bankers have ever come up what might be called zingers.

      "bodyText": "Central bankers rarely say anything that sticks in the memory. Mark Carney has been at the Bank of England for the past six years and is known as the rock star central banker, and not always in a good way. His answers to questions at press conferences are often like solos from the lead guitarist of a 1970s prog rock band: long and boring. Indeed, only two central bankers have ever come up what might be called zingers. William McChesney Martin, who ran the US central bank for almost two decades from 1951 to 1970, said the Federal Reserve was in the position of a \u201cchaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is \u201cturbo-charging\u201d preparations to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October as his government\u2019s number one priority, according to several senior cabinet ministers. The new prime minister sent out cabinet ministers for interviews across newspapers and broadcasters this weekend as part of a publicity blitz about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Their message is that the UK will be heading for no deal unless EU leaders agree to replace the Irish backstop. Michael Gove, the new Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal preparations, said the government was \u201coperating on the assumption\u201d that Britain would leave without a deal on 31 October and it was a \u201cvery real prospect\u201d because EU leaders had so far not changed their minds about scrapping the backstop. He said in the Sunday Times that an agreement might not be struck with Brussels by then, but there was a \u201cnew clarity of mission, we will exit the EU on October 31, no ifs, no buts, no more delay\u201d. On Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, he said: \u201cYou can\u2019t just reheat the dish that\u2019s been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable.\u201d At the same time, Sajid Javid, the new chancellor, told the Sunday Telegraph there would be \u201csignificant extra funding\u201d this week to get Britain \u201cfully ready to leave\u201d the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. He said the additional spending would include financing one of the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever public information campaigns\u201d to ensure individuals and businesses were ready for a no-deal exit. Javid added that he planned to fund 500 new Border Force officers and look at new infrastructure around the country\u2019s ports to minimise congestion and ensure goods could flow. And Priti Patel, the new home secretary, told the Mail on Sunday that she would stop the \u201cautomatic right of entry for EU citizens, with or without work\u201d in order to give the \u201ctype of preference to brilliant scientists, academics and highly skilled workers that we want to see more of\u201d. Gove and Javid are part of a new \u201cwar cabinet\u201d of six key ministers to deliver Brexit by 31 October \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. Rishi Sunak, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, then gave an interview on Sky News saying the government was \u201cturbo-charging\u201d no-deal preparations. \u201cOf course we would prefer to [leave] with a new deal, one that removes this anti-democratic backstop,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are prepared to enter into negotiations with the spirit of friendship and determination but if the EU doesn\u2019t want to do that it is right we are absolutely prepared for that. We are turbo-charging preparations for no deal. That is now the government\u2019s number one priority.\u201d Johnson is pushing ahead with the preparations despite cross-party MPs pledging to join forces to prevent no deal. Philip Hammond, the former Conservative chancellor, held private talks with Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, shortly before Johnson entered Downing Street last Wednesday, to plot cross-party moves aimed at preventing the new prime minister agreeing to a no-deal Brexit. However, Johnson\u2019s new senior adviser Dominic Cummings has put the government on a war footing to face opponents in parliament and achieve an exit on 31 October with or without a deal. He told a meeting of the prime minister\u2019s advisers that he had been tasked with delivering Brexit \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. There is growing speculation that this could include an election if parliament blocks the new government\u2019s Brexit plans, even though Johnson has ruled that out. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party was ready for an election, telling Sky that he was \u201cnot in the slightest bit\u201d fazed by going up against Johnson. Meanwhile, polls have suggested the Tories were boosted by a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d after the election of their new leader. Since Johnson became prime minister, the Conservatives have gained 10 points to stand at 30%, new polling by Opinium for the Observer showed. The polling shows the Conservatives benefiting from an ebbing of support away from the Brexit party. Despite being pushed into second place, Labour are also up three points to 28% at the expense of the Green party.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s become a truism of modern-day politics that social media and the online activism it enables have coarsened debate and left politicians vulnerable to campaigns of intimidation. What is less widely known is that the same is said of medical science. Earlier this year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/profmsharpe\" title=\"\">Michael Sharpe</a>, a professor of psychological medicine at the University of Oxford, announced that he had withdrawn from research on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/chronic-fatigue-syndrome\" title=\"\">myalgic encephalomyelitis</a> (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), because the field had become \u201ctoo toxic\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sharpe says that he has received \u201cthousands of emails calling me every obscenity you can imagine\u201d \u2013 largely from ME sufferers or their advocates. But this, he reckons, is not the real problem. What concerns him far more is when activists target the official machinery to undermine a professional reputation.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many freedom of information requests we\u2019ve had,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s well over 100. There have been three debates in parliament about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/me-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-patients-suffer-put-off-treatments-our-research\" title=\"\">Pace trial</a> with one or two MPs using parliamentary privilege to allege that we\u2019re fraudulent scientists. We\u2019ve had investigation by the Health Research Authority. Most of us have been reported to the General Medical Council in an attempt to get our medical licences removed. So you find yourself constantly under investigation for some kind of fraud or semi-criminality or medical misconduct. And that is the problem. You can\u2019t function like that.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"de7795f9-da64-426e-9c02-23db960b4add\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>85%</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Of sufferers in England have experienced loss of employment due to chronic fatigue syndrome/ME&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>\u00a33.3bn</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Estimated cost to&nbsp;the UK&nbsp;economy&nbsp;of CFS/ME&nbsp;in&nbsp;2014/15</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>17m </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Number of people worldwide who have&nbsp;CFS/ME, including&nbsp;more than 250,000&nbsp;in the UK</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>\u00a3542m</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Total spent by&nbsp;the NHS&nbsp;on people&nbsp;with CFS/ME in&nbsp;2014/15&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>76%</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Of those living with&nbsp;CFS/ME in the UK&nbsp;are women&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Pace trial, of which Sharpe was an author, was a landmark 2011 study published in the <em>Lancet</em> that examined the effects of various therapies on people suffering from ME/CFS. The trial became the subject of controversy for several reasons. One is that it looked at ways of dealing with the symptoms of an illness rather than exploring a cure for a disease. Another is that it suggested there might be a psychological component to the manner in which sufferers experience the illness. And then finally, question marks were raised over the trial\u2019s methodology.</p> \n<p>There are a number of conditions, including ME/CFS, that fall into the frustrating category of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Others include fibromyalgia and multiple chemical sensitivity. What they all share, to varying degrees, is a scientific uncertainty about cause. And as a result, many of these conditions have sufferers who have become embittered by what they perceive as the failure of the medical establishment to take their chronic illnesses seriously.</p> \n<p>In a 2001 survey of 400 GPs, 64% thought patients with MUS had psychiatric illnesses and 84% thought they had personality problems. It\u2019s in that context that there is a heightened sensitivity to claims about the efficacy of psychological treatments. The Pace trial found that there were significant improvements in the wellbeing of patients who underwent either cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or graded exercise treatment (GET). The questioning of the legitimacy of the trial was immediate.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We start with&nbsp;questions and&nbsp;hypotheses. These people have&nbsp;a&nbsp;different perspective and we keep getting the wrong answers</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Michael Sharpe</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Sharpe first became interested in the relationship between ME/CFS and psychological therapies in the late 1980s when he ran a psychiatry and psychology service at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford.

As he has written: \u201cThe term CFS trivialised a serious medical condition \u2013 the equivalent of trivialising dementia by calling it a chronic forgetfulness syndrome \u2013 and shifted the focus from a \u2018disease\u2019 to a single symptom, \u2018chronic fatigue\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shepherd says that Pace endorsed the belief that there is \u201cno disease process going on, no disease causing these symptoms\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sharpe counters that nowhere in his writing has he ever argued that there is no underlying disease, only that, given the disease has not been identified, the most effective current treatment has to be directed at the symptoms. \u201cI have always said that, like all chronic illnesses, there is a percentage of the variance that\u2019s caused by how people cope with it, how they think about it, how they behave.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s become a truism of modern-day politics that social media and the online activism it enables have coarsened debate and left politicians vulnerable to campaigns of intimidation. What is less widely known is that the same is said of medical science. Earlier this year Michael Sharpe, a professor of psychological medicine at the University of Oxford, announced that he had withdrawn from research on myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), because the field had become \u201ctoo toxic\u201d. Sharpe says that he has received \u201cthousands of emails calling me every obscenity you can imagine\u201d \u2013 largely from ME sufferers or their advocates. But this, he reckons, is not the real problem. What concerns him far more is when activists target the official machinery to undermine a professional reputation. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many freedom of information requests we\u2019ve had,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s well over 100. There have been three debates in parliament about the Pace trial with one or two MPs using parliamentary privilege to allege that we\u2019re fraudulent scientists. We\u2019ve had investigation by the Health Research Authority. Most of us have been reported to the General Medical Council in an attempt to get our medical licences removed. So you find yourself constantly under investigation for some kind of fraud or semi-criminality or medical misconduct. And that is the problem. You can\u2019t function like that.\u201d The Pace trial, of which Sharpe was an author, was a landmark 2011 study published in the Lancet that examined the effects of various therapies on people suffering from ME/CFS. The trial became the subject of controversy for several reasons. One is that it looked at ways of dealing with the symptoms of an illness rather than exploring a cure for a disease. Another is that it suggested there might be a psychological component to the manner in which sufferers experience the illness. And then finally, question marks were raised over the trial\u2019s methodology. There are a number of conditions, including ME/CFS, that fall into the frustrating category of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Others include fibromyalgia and multiple chemical sensitivity. What they all share, to varying degrees, is a scientific uncertainty about cause. And as a result, many of these conditions have sufferers who have become embittered by what they perceive as the failure of the medical establishment to take their chronic illnesses seriously. In a 2001 survey of 400 GPs, 64% thought patients with MUS had psychiatric illnesses and 84% thought they had personality problems. It\u2019s in that context that there is a heightened sensitivity to claims about the efficacy of psychological treatments. The Pace trial found that there were significant improvements in the wellbeing of patients who underwent either cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or graded exercise treatment (GET). The questioning of the legitimacy of the trial was immediate. Sharpe first became interested in the relationship between ME/CFS and psychological therapies in the late 1980s when he ran a psychiatry and psychology service at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. An infectious disease doctor kept telling him that his clinic was full of chronically fatigued patients whom he was unable to help. Symptoms vary in the condition but in many cases sufferers report total exhaustion and an inability to move, let alone exercise. Sharpe says he decided to try some CBT treatments, which proved \u201cremarkably helpful\u201d. In 1996, he published his first trial in the British Medical Journal and his head of department received a letter saying the research was flawed. \u201cLuckily, in those days the head of department just looked at the data, said it all seemed fine and told me to carry on.\u201d By 2011, and the publication of the Pace trial, Sharpe\u2019s opponents were a lot more organised. \u201cSocial media had become more prominent,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of this had been people in their bedrooms writing in green ink up until then.\u201d But what really made the difference, he says, is that \u201cthe Americans got involved\u201d. The United States has a very different system of healthcare, which is largely private and insurance-based. That means the validity of diagnosis, what will and will not be accepted by insurance firms, is critical. If you suffer from an unrecognised condition, there\u2019s a very good chance you won\u2019t be able to receive any treatment.

Over 20 years ago, the New England Journal of Medicine ran an editorial on increasingly aggressive campaigns against medical researchers, warning that \u201cwith widening media coverage of health research, and expanding research on the outcomes of clinical care, such attacks may become more frequent and acrimonious\u201d.

Each chapter of <em>The Garden Jungle</em> begins with a recipe \u2013 from home-brewed cider to mulberry muffins to Jerusalem artichoke soup. These culinary snippets paint a picture of the good life, showing how our approach to managing our gardens can lead to a deeper and more permanent re-engagement with nature, one that feeds through to our physical and mental health, as well as being a necessary counterbalance to the chemical-intensive aggro-industrial complex that is doing its best to destroy our environment.</p> <p><em>The Garden Jungle</em> purports to be \u201ca celebration of the lives of the little creatures that live in our gardens\u201d, but is in fact, in its way, as radical and angry as Mark Cocker\u2019s galvanising <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/17/our-place-review-mark-cocker-blistering-attack-britain-conservation-failures\" title=\"\">Our Place</a></em>.

      "bodyText": "Every year, towards the end of May or the beginning of June, I catch my wife looking shifty. She always sets to work in the evening, as dusk draws in, hoping that I\u2019ll be too wrapped up in a book to notice her nefarious activities. By some strange and unstated rule of garden administration, the hydrangeas in our two-acre plot of Kentish Weald are her preserve. After our first year in the house, when they were ravaged by slugs, she now surrounds the Annabelles and Emile Mouill\u00e8res with little blue pellets of songbird \u2013 and hedgehog-killing metaldehyde. I disapprove \u2013 I run my horticultural bailiwicks on strictly organic lines \u2013 but I recognise that I am still in the minority when it comes to Britain\u2019s gardeners. Dave Goulson is the country\u2019s foremost expert on bees, the author of the superlative A Buzz in the Meadow, and has now written an exquisite, compelling and quietly evangelical book about how gardeners can play their part in saving the planet. Each chapter of The Garden Jungle begins with a recipe \u2013 from home-brewed cider to mulberry muffins to Jerusalem artichoke soup. These culinary snippets paint a picture of the good life, showing how our approach to managing our gardens can lead to a deeper and more permanent re-engagement with nature, one that feeds through to our physical and mental health, as well as being a necessary counterbalance to the chemical-intensive aggro-industrial complex that is doing its best to destroy our environment. The Garden Jungle purports to be \u201ca celebration of the lives of the little creatures that live in our gardens\u201d, but is in fact, in its way, as radical and angry as Mark Cocker\u2019s galvanising Our Place. Goulson, like Cocker, has grown tired of the hypocritical paradox that lies at the heart of Britain\u2019s relationship with nature \u2013 that we profess ourselves to be gifted gardeners, champions of wildlife, but are destroying the networks of biodiversity in our countryside more quickly than almost anywhere else on the planet. Where Goulson\u2019s book is so good is in suggesting specific, practical and easily implemented remedies that every gardener can adopt, no matter how small their patch. It\u2019s easy to feel that we are powerless to stand in the way of climate change and the collapse of pollinator numbers, but, Goulson says, even the smallest act of resistance is meaningful both in the cumulative effect widespread green gardening would have on the environment, but also in the message it sends about where our priorities lie. A lawn \u2013 \u201cneat, green and stripy\u201d as we British like them \u2013 is an environmental wasteland. Over the last year, I\u2019ve slowly stopped mowing ours and now, knee-high and dense with wildflowers, it thrums with crickets in high summer, teems with a vast range of butterflies and bees. We need writers such as Goulson just now and this is a book that should be read by every gardener in the country: a manifesto for the grey-haired branch of Extinction Rebellion. It may feel like the world is on a downward slope both precipitous and irredeemable; Goulson says that by acting together, we might just turn things round, one garden at a time. \u2022 The Garden Jungle Or Gardening to Save the Planet by Dave Goulson is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a316.99).

The furniture is antique, campaign style mainly. Everything is solid oak and I hand-finished the floor. I like my desk area; I can sit there with the side door open and read and write songs.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m really into old clothes \u2013 I love Victoriana, and I have a really large collection of old pocketwatches. I get a lot of clothes made because I\u2019m a big lad and it\u2019s difficult to source them second hand \u2013 everyone was so small back then. We have a thing called towpath chic \u2013 it\u2019s like a dystopian rustic mix and the colours are very natural: greens and brown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cdfb7916-2bf5-4323-a87c-eba878c7cc82\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic \u2013 and newly costly.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain\u2019s cities, Guardian Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.</p>\n    <p><b>Chris Michael, Cities editor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There are certain noises you learn by being on the canal that other people don\u2019t know. You know what kind of birds are outside your boat by the way they tap on the side. At night, you can tell if it\u2019s a swan or a duck or a coot by the tapping.</p> \n<p>Living on a boat forces you to be green. I have two solar panels. Our water is in a thousand-litre stainless steel water tank that we fill up from water points. All the wood we use is reconstituted wood and the electricity is run by batteries \u2013 we don\u2019t plug in to the short.

The best bit is the freedom and the idea that you can just move wherever you want \u2013 a nomad lifestyle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3d7b2eeb1c7a00eb457ec01963b2ac9305294de\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3d7b2eeb1c7a00eb457ec01963b2ac9305294de/0_0_4904_3678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Matt, Jo and Billy Beau's narrowboat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>You\u2019re outside a lot of the time which is really nice.

The best bit is when spring arrives and you\u2019re like: \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s nice living on a boat.\u201d We basically live outside and Billy Beau, who is two, loves it. Every morning he speaks to the swans and he knows the names of all the wildlife.</p> \n<p>What do our wardrobes consist of? About 10 pairs of dungarees. Matt wears a waistcoat with a tiny vest underneath in the summer. Large party dresses with netting underneath are a big no-no on a boat because you\u2019d knock everything over, and if you fell in you\u2019d sink. Usually Matt only wears his very short shorts that he likes to call his ballsy shorts. That\u2019s all he wears because it\u2019s too hot in the winter with the fire on and too hot in summer for clothes.

It was a wreck but I did something with it, sold it and bought another one. This is my fifth boat \u2013 it\u2019s pirate-themed. All my life people have compared me to a pirate; if I find an object, I\u2019ll use it, like the curtains and the skulls. I\u2019m on an army pension and it does not suffice me to live in a flat or a house. I\u2019ve lived on a boat for seven years. Now my rent is cheap, council tax is cheap, it\u2019s cheap living and I can afford it even if I lose all my benefits.</p> \n<p>Since I\u2019ve been on a boat my life has gone from shit to pretty amazing. The community here is very tight-knit and I seem to be the centre of it. You\u2019ll never meet such a diverse range of people as have been brought together by boats and this marina [New Islington, Manchester]. I often dress as a pirate \u2013 not every day, but if I go to a gig or a festival. When I first saw this boat it was a right mess and I always said it would look good as a pirate boat. How it looks today is how I always knew it could look.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Our favourite boat-term is gongoozler\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"034dd0e75c7bb8997911ed598d8519540775f27e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034dd0e75c7bb8997911ed598d8519540775f27e/0_576_4773_2864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cressida wears Kowtow at folkclothing.com, Jonah wears shorts by Oliver Spencer, shirt by Jon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cressida wears Kowtow at <a href=\"https://www.folkclothing.com/\">folkclothing.com</a>, Jonah wears shorts by <a href=\"https://oliverspencer.co.uk/\">oliverspencer.co.uk</a>, shirt his own.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Cressida Kocienski</em> <em>is a filmmaker from Leeds, and Jonah Falco is a musician and engineer from Toronto, Canada</em></p> \n<p>Living on a boat is hard work but a lot of fun. It also has a really strong community, especially of women, which is something that is really appealing. It\u2019s hard to connect with people in London but living on a boat you have a readymade community of people that are always there for you.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c0b81ce1858c06e0b967a9bd29cf56d1d2504f64\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0b81ce1858c06e0b967a9bd29cf56d1d2504f64/0_0_3479_4789/726.jpg\" alt=\"Jonah and Cressida's stove.\" width=\"726\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Our boat is manufactured by Harland &amp; Wolff. It\u2019s a star class butty and was built in 1935. During the war women were drafted to keep the freight going when the men went off to war, and the woman who steered our boat was called Frankie C Martin.</p> \n<p>Our wardrobes have a lot of stuff we don\u2019t mind getting mud and coal on. Less durable fabrics won\u2019t last you more than 20 minutes. Hard-wearing things are good.</p> \n<p>Our favourite boat-term is gongoozler \u2013 it\u2019s used to describe a non-boater. It could be someone who likes to sit and watch boats go up and down, or people in Camden staring at you and filming you \u2013 that\u2019s gongoozling. We are often seen as a nuisance community, but we are also a stabilising and creative community, living in a way that points towards a better future for sustainability.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Sandals are a big no-no because you can trip up\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7df6347ef6d87c51abb03505f358ae680ccd57ee\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df6347ef6d87c51abb03505f358ae680ccd57ee/0_594_4904_2942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grace Mattimore and her dog Rolo, Manchester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grace Mattimore and her dog, Rolo, at their mooring in Manchester.

I\u2019d always wanted to \u2013 I used to walk along the canals and love it. The opportunity came one day and I thought: if I don\u2019t do it now I\u2019ll never do it. I\u2019ve got a cruiser stern and it\u2019s about 50ft.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve been up to Hebden Bridge, Marple, Macclesfield and the Peaks on my boat. I\u2019ve been up to Lymm, I\u2019ve done the Leeds and Liverpool canal. I\u2019ve done quite a bit.</p> \n<p>When you\u2019re doing work on your boat, you don\u2019t wear your best clothes; it gets very dirty and muddy. Sandals are a big no-no when you\u2019re doing the locks because you can trip up, and I have sometimes (although I do wear them anyway.)</p> \n<p>When you\u2019re washing up, liquid goes straight out of your sink and into the canal \u2013 I don\u2019t really agree with that so I get the eco [washing-up liquid]. I use a composting toilet, and solar panels. It\u2019s quite hard, especially in the winter. Boat life is best in summer \u2013 you can take your boat out cruising and get to enjoy the sunshine on it.</p> \n<h2>\u2018You\u2019re so much more aware of what you consume\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"788a623f839fc6bf5eab37213089f507d504e014\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/788a623f839fc6bf5eab37213089f507d504e014/0_115_4904_2942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poppy and Toby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poppy wears dress by <a href=\"https://www.marquesalmeida.com/\">marquesalmeida.com</a>; Toby wears trousers by <a href=\"http://gap.co.uk/\">gap.co.uk</a>, T-shirt <a href=\"https://uk.americanvintage-store.com/en/\">americavintage-store.com</a>, sunglasses <a href=\"http://persol.com/\">persol.com</a>.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Poppy Okotcha is a model from the UK and South Africa, and Toby Burgess is an architect and jewellery</em><em> maker from Cornwall</em></p> \n<p>We\u2019ve been living on boats for four years.

We consciously don\u2019t make much rubbish, especially when we\u2019re moving the boat around, because you have to put it somewhere and that\u2019s quite tricky.

We\u2019re looking forward to what will happen with the policy change around diesel engines because nearly all boats have diesel engines and so it will be interesting to see the switch to electric. </p> \n<p>Boating does make you more conscious of the environment when you see how things affect the canal. You notice when there is a really big freeze and you can\u2019t move your boat and the ducks can\u2019t get into the water. When you\u2019re detached in a house, you don\u2019t even necessarily know if it\u2019s raining.</p> \n<p>We didn\u2019t know when we got onto the canals that we\u2019d find a community as friendly as it is. Everyone likes coming to parties on boats \u2013 it makes it feel special because you\u2019re separate from land.

      "bodyText": "Hawkeye is a musician and songwriter from Dorset and is moored in Hertfordshire This is a 70ft tug-style boat and I\u2019ve lived on it for the past six years. The furniture is antique, campaign style mainly. Everything is solid oak and I hand-finished the floor. I like my desk area; I can sit there with the side door open and read and write songs. I\u2019m really into old clothes \u2013 I love Victoriana, and I have a really large collection of old pocketwatches. I get a lot of clothes made because I\u2019m a big lad and it\u2019s difficult to source them second hand \u2013 everyone was so small back then. We have a thing called towpath chic \u2013 it\u2019s like a dystopian rustic mix and the colours are very natural: greens and brown. There are certain noises you learn by being on the canal that other people don\u2019t know. You know what kind of birds are outside your boat by the way they tap on the side. At night, you can tell if it\u2019s a swan or a duck or a coot by the tapping. Living on a boat forces you to be green. I have two solar panels. Our water is in a thousand-litre stainless steel water tank that we fill up from water points. All the wood we use is reconstituted wood and the electricity is run by batteries \u2013 we don\u2019t plug in to the short. I think it\u2019s one of the greenest ways to live. \u2018What\u2019s in our wardrobes? About 10 pairs of dungarees\u2019 Jo Bowis, from Cornwall, is a member of the Mediaeval Baebes, an actors\u2019 agent and author of Express Yourself: a Mamoir. Her partner, Matt, from Stoke-on-Trent, is artistic director of the Crystal Maze Live Experience. We\u2019ve lived on this boat for four years. It\u2019s a 55ft narrowboat and it\u2019s a cruiser stern, which basically means there\u2019s a bit of outside area at the back of it. The best bit is the freedom and the idea that you can just move wherever you want \u2013 a nomad lifestyle. You\u2019re outside a lot of the time which is really nice. The worst bit is changing the toilet, and the darkness in winter is really hard too. The best bit is when spring arrives and you\u2019re like: \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s nice living on a boat.\u201d We basically live outside and Billy Beau, who is two, loves it. Every morning he speaks to the swans and he knows the names of all the wildlife. What do our wardrobes consist of? About 10 pairs of dungarees. Matt wears a waistcoat with a tiny vest underneath in the summer. Large party dresses with netting underneath are a big no-no on a boat because you\u2019d knock everything over, and if you fell in you\u2019d sink. Usually Matt only wears his very short shorts that he likes to call his ballsy shorts. That\u2019s all he wears because it\u2019s too hot in the winter with the fire on and too hot in summer for clothes. Ballsy shorts suffice all year round. \u2018I often dress as a pirate\u2019 Dave is a retired soldier from Leicester and is moored in Manchester After I split up with my wife, I went on eBay and bought a boat, just like that. It was a wreck but I did something with it, sold it and bought another one. This is my fifth boat \u2013 it\u2019s pirate-themed. All my life people have compared me to a pirate; if I find an object, I\u2019ll use it, like the curtains and the skulls. I\u2019m on an army pension and it does not suffice me to live in a flat or a house. I\u2019ve lived on a boat for seven years. Now my rent is cheap, council tax is cheap, it\u2019s cheap living and I can afford it even if I lose all my benefits. Since I\u2019ve been on a boat my life has gone from shit to pretty amazing. The community here is very tight-knit and I seem to be the centre of it. You\u2019ll never meet such a diverse range of people as have been brought together by boats and this marina [New Islington, Manchester]. I often dress as a pirate \u2013 not every day, but if I go to a gig or a festival. When I first saw this boat it was a right mess and I always said it would look good as a pirate boat. How it looks today is how I always knew it could look. \u2018Our favourite boat-term is gongoozler\u2019 Cressida Kocienski is a filmmaker from Leeds, and Jonah Falco is a musician and engineer from Toronto, Canada Living on a boat is hard work but a lot of fun. It also has a really strong community, especially of women, which is something that is really appealing. It\u2019s hard to connect with people in London but living on a boat you have a readymade community of people that are always there for you. Our boat is manufactured by Harland &amp; Wolff. It\u2019s a star class butty and was built in 1935. During the war women were drafted to keep the freight going when the men went off to war, and the woman who steered our boat was called Frankie C Martin. Our wardrobes have a lot of stuff we don\u2019t mind getting mud and coal on. Less durable fabrics won\u2019t last you more than 20 minutes. Hard-wearing things are good. Our favourite boat-term is gongoozler \u2013 it\u2019s used to describe a non-boater. It could be someone who likes to sit and watch boats go up and down, or people in Camden staring at you and filming you \u2013 that\u2019s gongoozling. We are often seen as a nuisance community, but we are also a stabilising and creative community, living in a way that points towards a better future for sustainability. \u2018Sandals are a big no-no because you can trip up\u2019 Grace Mattimore is a head chef from Manchester I\u2019ve lived on a boat for five years now. I\u2019d always wanted to \u2013 I used to walk along the canals and love it. The opportunity came one day and I thought: if I don\u2019t do it now I\u2019ll never do it. I\u2019ve got a cruiser stern and it\u2019s about 50ft. I\u2019ve been up to Hebden Bridge, Marple, Macclesfield and the Peaks on my boat. I\u2019ve been up to Lymm, I\u2019ve done the Leeds and Liverpool canal. I\u2019ve done quite a bit. When you\u2019re doing work on your boat, you don\u2019t wear your best clothes; it gets very dirty and muddy. Sandals are a big no-no when you\u2019re doing the locks because you can trip up, and I have sometimes (although I do wear them anyway.) When you\u2019re washing up, liquid goes straight out of your sink and into the canal \u2013 I don\u2019t really agree with that so I get the eco [washing-up liquid]. I use a composting toilet, and solar panels. It\u2019s quite hard, especially in the winter. Boat life is best in summer \u2013 you can take your boat out cruising and get to enjoy the sunshine on it. \u2018You\u2019re so much more aware of what you consume\u2019 Poppy Okotcha is a model from the UK and South Africa, and Toby Burgess is an architect and jewellery maker from Cornwall We\u2019ve been living on boats for four years. We love the idea that they are little off-grid homes and it makes you so much more aware of what you consume. We consciously don\u2019t make much rubbish, especially when we\u2019re moving the boat around, because you have to put it somewhere and that\u2019s quite tricky. You never really leave lights on; it\u2019s like a reflex now. Even if we do eventually move off the boat, we\u2019re going to be taking that lesson with us. We\u2019re looking forward to what will happen with the policy change around diesel engines because nearly all boats have diesel engines and so it will be interesting to see the switch to electric. Boating does make you more conscious of the environment when you see how things affect the canal. You notice when there is a really big freeze and you can\u2019t move your boat and the ducks can\u2019t get into the water. When you\u2019re detached in a house, you don\u2019t even necessarily know if it\u2019s raining. We didn\u2019t know when we got onto the canals that we\u2019d find a community as friendly as it is. Everyone likes coming to parties on boats \u2013 it makes it feel special because you\u2019re separate from land. It\u2019s kind of like a secret password when you say: \u201cI live on a boat.\u201d \u2018You live a much simpler life\u2019 Phelan is an architect from Berlin and is moored in London My boat is not a classic narrowboat style \u2013 it has a bit of a retro and futuristic charisma. My girlfriend and I had never been to London before \u2013 we moved straight on to the boat and it was a great way to see different parts of the city. When we bought the boat it was like a shell and we built it back up from the ground. We re-did all the electrics and the plumbing, and all the joinery \u2013 we were living in a construction [site] for three years. It was pretty terrible at times. The logistics of getting a sheet of plywood inside the boat are difficult, so I had to get it delivered to work and then get it here. Then it doesn\u2019t fit through the door so you start cutting it up on the roof, and when you get it in nothing is square. You can\u2019t even use a spirit level because it\u2019s on the water so obviously it moves. I\u2019d describe the boat\u2019s interior as open, warm and cavernous. We burn firewood and coal for heating so I don\u2019t think living on a boat is very sustainable in itself, but you develop a really good awareness about sustainability. You generate a good sensibility for how much power different appliances use, so we can\u2019t use an electric kettle, for example, because everything that generates heat uses a massive amount of energy. You become aware how much is needed to live and you live a much simpler life. It\u2019s quite liberating. \u2018You need good weather gear\u2019 Mark Kennedy is an artist from Manchester For me, living on a boat was purely accidental \u2013 it just became available and I needed somewhere to live.

The Suns have finally gone down at the end of a long day of sport. And frankly, I need a lie down after that one. There were some big performances today - from the Giants in the Super Netball, the Raiders in the NRL, and the Bulldogs in the AFL, but it was that last game that really got the blood pumping. The Bombers can now dream of a top-four finish, while the Gold Coast will rue another missed opportunity to snap their horror run. And spare a thought for Dale Morris, the 250-game Bulldog who looks like he may have seriously injured his knee. Thanks for joining me today, I\u2019ll catch you next time.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T09:43:44.415Z\">at 10.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3d68308f08d0b6ca5392d7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T09:22:44.930Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AFL: Full-time - Gold Coast Suns 15.6 (96) lose to Essendon Bombers 16.10 (106)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A cracking finish to end the night. The Bombers finally see off the Suns, but they left it about as late as humanly possible. A late couple of goals makes the final score look a little more comfortable than it was, the Suns even nudged ahead at one stage. Brave stuff from Gold Coast who played an equal role in making this a thriller - not that it\u2019s much of a consolation considering their position on the ladder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a4d7a1bda8807cfd279903bb5f224d6b3a813eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a4d7a1bda8807cfd279903bb5f224d6b3a813eb/0_73_1773_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Stringer celebrates a goal at Metricon Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Stringer celebrates a goal at Metricon Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hyde/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>AAP - Bombers sneak past Suns in AFL thriller</strong></p> <p>Goals in the dying seconds by Cale Hooker and Jake Stringer secured Essendon a narrow 10-point AFL win over Gold Coast. The Bombers were two points behind with just over a minute to play at Metricon Stadium when Hooker slotted a set shot to put the visitors in front. From the resulting centre bounce, Jake Stringer came away with the football and booted it from inside the centre square, his shot bouncing through to seal the 16.10 (106) to 15.6 (96) win.</p> <p>The goal was Stringer\u2019s fourth in a best-on-ground display by the Essendon forward and secured the Bombers their fifth-straight win. Defeat, the Suns\u2019 14th in a row, was harsh on the hosts who thought they might have secured a massive upset when Chris Burgess scored with two and half minutes to play to put Gold Coast ahead.</p> <p>Burgess had earlier been at the centre of a highly controversial goal umpiring decision in the third quarter. A set shot by David Zaharakis was tapped back into play by Burgess despite appearing to have crossed the goal line. Replays showed the ball was about a foot over the line when Burgess touched it but because the umpires had called play on, there was no score review and the goal was not given.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T10:12:46.726Z\">at 11.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3d66578f08d0b6ca5392ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-28T09:12:14.536Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>AFL</strong>: Who\u2019s more nervous in this situation?

Coyne had met with Beattie and was told only a small majority of the 16 NRL clubs supported him staying.</p> <p>Beattie said a replacement would likely be in place late in the year and was adamant the commission wouldn\u2019t be rushed.Under current laws, anyone who holds an NRL club job must wait three years after leaving it before being allowed to join the commission.

Titmus was clearly emotional as she left the pool, not stopping for reporters after news broke about her training partner Shayna Jack\u2019s positive test for a banned substance.</p> <p>The Dolphins had plenty to celebrate on the second last night of the world titles, also adding 4x100m mixed freestyle silver and 200m backstroke silver to their growing tally. However, the news about Jack clearly rocked Dolphins teammates particularly Titmus who trains with the 20-year-old under mentor Dean Boxall in Brisbane.</p> <p>Titmus still had plenty to be proud about despite Ledecky finally avenging her shock 400m freestyle loss to the Australian at the start of the meet. Ledecky missed the 200m and 1500m after she succumbed to a stomach bug following her rare defeat at the hands of Titmus.</p> <p>Before the race Ledecky had not been beaten over 400m, 800m or 1500m at a major meet since 2012. </p> <p>Ledecky returned from her sick bed, only for Titmus to again help relegate the American to silver in Thursday\u2019s 4x200m freestyle relay final with Australia claiming a stunning gold. But Ledecky finally got her revenge as she claimed her fourth straight 800m world title, finishing almost one and a half seconds ahead of Italy\u2019s Simona Quadrella.</p> <p>Ledecky became the fourth woman to win a specific individual event four times, joining Hungary\u2019s Katinka Hosszu, Italy\u2019s Federica Pellegrini and Swede Sarah Sjostrom.

There were some big performances today - from the Giants in the Super Netball, the Raiders in the NRL, and the Bulldogs in the AFL, but it was that last game that really got the blood pumping. The Bombers can now dream of a top-four finish, while the Gold Coast will rue another missed opportunity to snap their horror run. And spare a thought for Dale Morris, the 250-game Bulldog who looks like he may have seriously injured his knee. Thanks for joining me today, I\u2019ll catch you next time. A cracking finish to end the night. The Bombers finally see off the Suns, but they left it about as late as humanly possible. A late couple of goals makes the final score look a little more comfortable than it was, the Suns even nudged ahead at one stage. Brave stuff from Gold Coast who played an equal role in making this a thriller - not that it\u2019s much of a consolation considering their position on the ladder. AAP - Bombers sneak past Suns in AFL thriller Goals in the dying seconds by Cale Hooker and Jake Stringer secured Essendon a narrow 10-point AFL win over Gold Coast. The Bombers were two points behind with just over a minute to play at Metricon Stadium when Hooker slotted a set shot to put the visitors in front. From the resulting centre bounce, Jake Stringer came away with the football and booted it from inside the centre square, his shot bouncing through to seal the 16.10 (106) to 15.6 (96) win. The goal was Stringer\u2019s fourth in a best-on-ground display by the Essendon forward and secured the Bombers their fifth-straight win. Defeat, the Suns\u2019 14th in a row, was harsh on the hosts who thought they might have secured a massive upset when Chris Burgess scored with two and half minutes to play to put Gold Coast ahead. Burgess had earlier been at the centre of a highly controversial goal umpiring decision in the third quarter. A set shot by David Zaharakis was tapped back into play by Burgess despite appearing to have crossed the goal line. Replays showed the ball was about a foot over the line when Burgess touched it but because the umpires had called play on, there was no score review and the goal was not given. AFL: Who\u2019s more nervous in this situation? The Suns - who are so close to snapping that mammoth losing streak, but otherwise have nothing to lose? Or the Bombers, who everyone expected to waltz this one but who must be confident after an excellent run. Just three points in it. Three minutes to go. AFL: Gold Coast Suns 13.6 (84) Essendon Bombers 14.9 (93) That\u2019s the last time I write off the Suns. Every time I do they seem to score. Two goals in it. Excitement she wrote. And controversy too - if the poor umpire call on the Bombers\u2019 goal-that-wasn\u2019t proves crucial. Five minutes left. AFL: Gold Coast Suns 11.6 (72) Essendon Bombers 13.8 (86) Out of all today\u2019s games, I wouldn\u2019t have pegged this one as the most exciting before kick-off. Every time it looks like the Bombers have finally got a grip on it, the Suns hit back. It looks like they\u2019re just starting to crack now. The Bombers extend their lead to 14 with 13 minutes to go. I think a few Gold Coast heads are starting to drop. After 13 straight defeats, I can\u2019t imagine self-belief is that high. AFL: The big talking point of the match so far - although if the Bombers win it might not be quite so headline worthy. Was the ball all the way over the line? Only joking, of course it was. AFL: 3QT - Gold Coast Suns 9.6 (60) Essendon Bombers 10.8 (68) That\u2019s got to hurt the Suns. A clutch of goals in a row at the end of the third and the Bombers have finally got their noses in front. If they keep this up, they could end up with even more body parts in front come the final siren. AFL: Looks like I\u2019ve put the mockers on the Suns... two quick goals from Essendon have put them within four points. In fact, you might say they\u2019re storming back. No apologies for that shameless picture pun. AFL - Gold Coast Suns 9.6 (60) Essendon Bombers 6.8 (44) The expected resurgence isn\u2019t quite manifesting for the Bombers. They keep whittling down the margin but the Suns keep bouncing back. If the gap stays in double digits for the change, we could be in for a cracking final quarter. Football: Little bit of fitness/illness news from Sydney\u2019s trip to China for the clash with Paris St-Germain on Tuesday. They\u2019d better not bring it back with them. I had a bout of something similar not long ago. Sickness has hit Sydney FC before their pre-season football friendly against French glamour club Paris St Germain in China. The Sky Blues arrived in China on Saturday evening but several of them have caught a bug, including captain and centre half Alex Wilkinson, left back Michael Zullo, young defender Patrick Flottmann, midfielder Brandon O\u2019Neill and a couple of staff members. The Sky Blues\u2019 match on Tuesday evening will be PSG\u2019s last pre-season hit-out and they could finally field Brazilian superstar Neymar, who didn\u2019t take part in their three previous warm-ups. (AAP) An excellent win for the Raiders against the Panthers, whose winning run of seven comes to a shuddering halt. It was a good contest but Canberra\u2019s class shone through in the end. They\u2019ve proved their worth as a top four team. AAP - Resilient Raiders end Panthers\u2019 streak Penrith have been brought back to earth with a thud after having their seven-game NRL winning streak emphatically snapped 30-18 by Canberra. The Panthers were on track for what would\u2019ve equalled a club-record eighth-straight victory when they shot out to a 4-0 lead in just the fourth minute. But the Raiders wasted little time in taking the lead in the 15th minute, before kicking on with a dominant second half to claim their sixth win in seven games. It was a resilient performance from Ricky Stuart\u2019s men, who had to contend with defending eight of the opening nine sets of the match. The victory consolidates Canberra\u2019s grip on fourth spot, while the defeat for Penrith leaves them precariously placed in seventh position. John Bateman continued his impressive maiden NRL season with another strong performance, scoring a try and running for a team-high 131 metres. Jack Wighton added a try assist, line-break assist and 111 metres. Canberra were holding onto a six-point lead at halftime but blew the game open with three tries in 13 minutes - all down their right edge. A comfortable finish for the Cats after a shaky start at the SCG. It looked like we might have a contest early doors but Geelong were just too good for the final three quarters and the Swans couldn\u2019t keep up. AAP - Cats\u2019 Hawkins kicks five in 250th AFL game Geelong spearhead Tom Hawkins has marked his 250th AFL game with his first five-goal haul of the season for the ladder leaders who have beaten Sydney by 27 points at the SCG. The Cats trailed by 14 points at quarter-time but controlled Sunday\u2019s game thereafter to charge to a 16.11 (107) to 12.8 (80) victory. After struggling in recent weeks to post high scores, Geelong kicked more than 100 points for the first time since round 12. The teams were level at half-time, but the Cats kicked away in the third quarter, booting four goals to one. Hawkins and Esava Ratugolea gave Geelong strong marking targets and Patrick Dangerfield, Mitch Duncan and Jordan Clark all contributed a couple of goals. The Cats\u2019 midfield were able to get on top after the first quarter, with Tim Kelly tallying a game-high 31 touches and Duncan and Joel Selwood also prominent. Sydney youngster Jordan Dawson continued his breakout season, kicking a career-best three goals and Isaac Heeney also booted three for the home team. NRL: Penrith 18-26 Canberra Grab your popcorn. We\u2019re into the final few minutes in Penrith and it\u2019s getting pretty tense out there. Both sides have played well, but the Raiders have been a smidge more clinical and creative. If they can hold on to beat a Panthers side that was flying before this game (and at the risk of jinxing it, it looks like they will), it will be a serious message of intent to their finals rivals. AFL: HT - Gold Coast Suns 7.3 (45) Essendon Bombers 4.5 (29) As expected, Essendon have come back into it - although the Suns still have a decent lead as we head into the main break. Sixteen in it but the in-form Bombers will still fancy their chances at overturning that deficit in the next two quarters. If not, a defeat now, and against this opposition, could prove a fatal blow to their finals momentum. NRL: As ScoMo might say, how weird is this? Canberra taking control at Panthers Stadium with a couple of quick tries - including this one. As tries go, it\u2019s an oddball. Literally. A spirited performance from the Thunderbirds in the final two quarters but it\u2019s the Vixens who finish on top after building that early margin. Report to follow. AAP - Vixens claim third straight win The Melbourne Vixens have taken a major step towards a Super Netball semi-final berth by defeating the Adelaide Thunderbirds 63-57. With all their returning World Cup players in action, the Vixens took care of business at Melbourne Arena on Sunday to sit on 54 competition points, two behind the second-placed Sunshine Coast Lightning. The home side were forced to grind out the result after grabbing a four-goal first-quarter lead, both sides scoring 16 goals apiece in the third and fourth quarters. Kate Moloney and Liz Watson provided plenty of drive through midcourt for the Vixens, the pair combining for 52 goal assists while Caitlin Thwaites finished with 30 goals from 33 attempts in her battle with Adelaide\u2019s defensive standout Shamera Sterling. Vixens goaler Tegan Philip (33/40) became the most capped Vixens player as she surpassed Bianca Chatfield\u2019s club record of 111 games. NRL: Penrith 12-18 Canberra A lovely team effort from the Raiders to grab another try early in the second half. Aidan Sezer the man finishing it off, picking up the kick through the line after one bounce. The conversion is good and the Panthers have their backs against the wall. Penrith haven\u2019t played badly at all, but the Raiders have been better. The Panthers need to respond quickly... and do! A chip from Maloney and Leota is the man to finish it off under the posts. Thirty minutes to go. AFL: 3QT - Sydney Swans 7.6 (48) - Geelong Cats 10.10 (70) A big quarter from the Cats as they dominate the midfield as well as the scoreboard. Just seven points from the Swans. It\u2019s going to take a massive final quarter from the hosts to turn things around, especially if the Cats back this up in the final quarter. AFL: 1Q - Gold Coast Suns 4.2 (26) - Essendon Bombers 1.3 (9) Just when it looked like every game today was going to form ... up pop Gold Coast. There\u2019s a lot of game still to come of course but the Suns go into the change with a healthy margin over the Dons after a surge midway through the first quarter. The Bombers fight to try and pull one back in the final minute but the Suns cling on for a 17-point lead. Game on. AFL: Swans 6.6 (42) - Cats 8.8 (56) The Cats are finally starting to turn the screw, building a healthy lead at the start of the third quarter. The Swans are clinging on, just, as Geelong show the form that has put them at the top of the ladder since round two. The next five or 10 minutes could decide the game if Geelong rack up a big margin. Warning signs for the Swans. The Bloods need to stop bleeding. NRL: HT - Penrith 6-12 Canberra The Raiders head into the sheds six points to the good, Cleary pulling two back with a kick at the siren. It\u2019s been a good battle so far, and the Panthers know they\u2019re still in the hunt - as they should after the run they\u2019ve been on. Bit of push and shove just before the end of the half. The ref waits for it to simmer down and, by the end of it all, there\u2019s nothing doing. Just a few words for Maloney to act more leader-like and pipe down. Like that\u2019ll happen. Basketball: Ben Simmons says he understands Australian fans being mad at him for pulling out of the basketball World Cup warm-up games but he\u2019s done it to help the Boomers. Simmons today became the latest big name unavailable for next month\u2019s matches in Australia, joining a swag of fellow NBA superstars who have withdrawn from the provisional US World Cup squad. It won\u2019t impress fans who had flocked to purchase tickets, starting at more than $200, with more than 50,000 expected at each of the Boomers v US games on August 22 and 24 at Melbourne\u2019s Marvel Stadium. \u201cPeople can be mad at me and I completely understand but my goal is to bring a (2020) Olympic medal to Australia,\u201d said Simmons. \u201cSo if you guys are mad at me now then that\u2019s fine but, hopefully, when I\u2019m holding that medal up with my teammates, then you guys are smiling.\u201d Simmons withdrew from the exhibition games after discussions with Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis. They agreed it was best for the team\u2019s preparation. \u201cOf course, I want to come home and play in front of Melbourne fans and Australian fans and bring basketball back here,\u201d said Simmons. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the toughest decision I\u2019ve had in a long time, since breaking my foot and not playing that whole (2016-17 rookie) season. It was a mutual decision.\u201d AAP NRL: Penrith 4-12 Canberra Time to jump over to Panthers Stadium where it\u2019s proving a bit of an arm wrestle - both sides playing well, confidence high, and just two points between them. A professional foul puts Whare in the bin for 10. No arguments either - it was pretty blatant, if not entirely necessary. Good opportunity for the Raiders... and they take it almost immediately. Whitehead makes the most of the Panthers\u2019 weakness to crash over. Croker kicks it to make it 12-4. The Raiders\u2019 tails are up. AFL: HT - Sydney Swans 6.5 (41) - Geelong Cats 6.5 (41) All square at half-time. Great first quarter from the Swans, but the Cats have bounced back in style. Loving this game so far. Every time it looks like the Cats are about to surge into the lead, the Swans respond to keep them in check. It\u2019s tighter than a World Cup final super over. Netball: HT - Vixens 31-25 Thunderbirds The Vixens have given themselves some breathing space at the break after edging the first two quarters. That big win for the Giants earlier in the day must have given them some extra incentive to cement their place in the top four. The Thunderbirds are not out of it yet though. AFL: Sydney Swans 4.4 (28) - Geelong Cats 3.3 (21) After all those full-time whistles, I can finally switch to the SCG where the Cats have just got back into it at the start of the second quarter with two quick goals. The Swans went into the first break in a strong position but there\u2019s a reason Geelong have been at the top of the ladder pretty much all season. The Swans respond with a goal of their own though. Early signs suggest we\u2019re in for a good one. The Bulldogs finish on the attack and with the Roosters holding on, but it was always a big ask to grab another eight points late on against the premiers. A routine, if not entirely convincing, win by the Roosters. The Bulldogs showed plenty of bite in that second half - but when the dust settled, they\u2019d lost. Again. Roosters up to third but the Raiders are up next and could jump back above them. AAP - Cordner hurt in Roosters\u2019 win over Dogs The Sydney Roosters\u2019 scratchy 20-12 win over Canterbury has come at a cost with Boyd Cordner, Siosiua Taukeiaho and Jared Warea-Hargreaves all facing time on the NRL sidelines. The premiers came into the match looking to reinforce their status as title favourites and, for a while in the opening half-hour, they threatened to blow the 15th-placed Bulldogs off ANZ Stadium. But in front of 10,586 fans, they failed to impress in the second half yet still did enough to record back-to-back wins. Cordner limped from the field with a calf injury in the 56th minute before Taukeiaho went off 11 minutes later with the same problem. Cordner is expected to miss a couple of weeks, meaning the Roosters are set to be without both of their skippers with Jake Friend nursing a fractured forearm. Waerea-Hargreaves might be the latest victim of the game\u2019s crackdown on late shots after being put on report for an off-the-ball hit on Jack Cogger. \u201cI know we\u2019re in a good spot,\u201d coach Trent Robinson said of his side\u2019s premiership defence. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to walk the same path. If you\u2019re looking for the exact same feeling, then you\u2019re crossing your fingers. You can\u2019t repeat what you did last year or what you did five years ago. I know we\u2019re in a hungry position. Do I want to see that first half again? Yes. Do I want to see a better second half? Yes.\u201d It\u2019s all over, Freo have finally been put out of their misery. They\u2019ve battled gamely without ever really making a dent in that big Bulldogs lead. For their part, the Dogs were excellent almost throughout, dominating the midfield. This win puts them up to ninth, right on the heels of the Crows. They need to build on it though - with two tough games against the Lions and Bombers coming up. Fingers crossed for Dale Morris on his injury, but it didn\u2019t look good. AAP - Dale Morris injury sours Bulldogs AFL win Western Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge is bracing himself for confirmation that the 47-point win over Fremantle at Marvel Stadium will be the last of Dale Morris\u2019 AFL career. In his first senior game since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the pre-season, Morris limped from the ground in the third quarter of Sunday\u2019s clash and took no further part in the 16.17 (113) to 9.12 (66) win in front of 21,181 fans. The 36-year-old crumpled to the turf after his left leg buckled under him as he attempted to change direction chasing a ball on the ground. He immediately motioned for assistance and hobbled to the bench under his own steam after being helped to his feet. Scans are expected to confirm the respected defender has ruptured the ligament again, which would end the 2016 premiership player\u2019s 253-game career. \u201cIt\u2019s a suspected ACL injury but we\u2019ll just need to take some time to confirm it,\u201d Beveridge said. \u201cIt would be great for (the scan) to come up otherwise, but we\u2019ll communicate that when we know what the status is.\u201d Morris, who fought back last year from a partially ruptured ACL in his other knee, remained upbeat on the bench, encouraging teammates and offering direction despite the devastating setback. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Beveridge said. \u201cI patted him on the back at three-quarter time and he had this big smile on his face and it just shows the character and attitude of Dale Morris. We\u2019re really fortunate to have had him in our ranks for so long.\u201d NRL: Bulldogs 6-20 Roosters Well that Bulldogs revival was short-lived, if anything it seemed to spark the Roosters into action. A Morris try and Mitchell conversion has reinstated the 14-point lead. Taukeiaho has just been helped off the field, trying not to put any pressure on his leg. That does not look good. Trent Robinson seems rightly concerned. Just over 10 minutes to go. NRL: The Warriors aren\u2019t letting go of the controversy over that Roger Tuivasa-Sheck \u2018forward\u2019 pass against the Eels last night. AAP: Warriors chief executive Cameron George will seek answers from the NRL over their latest refereeing grievances and has called on fans to make their own unique protest. George wants supporters to come to Friday\u2019s home game against Canberra dressed as referees following Saturday\u2019s contentious 24-22 loss to Parramatta at BankWest Stadium. Coach Stephen Kearney vented his frustration at the officiating and George told Radio Sport it continued a trend of rough refereeing against the New Zealand-based team over the last month. In a pitch that could create confusion for players at Mt Smart Stadium, George also urged fans to bring whistles. \u201cLet\u2019s give Canberra a bit of their own back in terms of what New Zealand\u2019s all about,\u201d George said. \u201cEveryone can bring a whistle if they want and have a bit of fun with it.\u201d Kearney was fuming that Parramatta won the penalty count 9-2 and also had a number of key decisions go their way, including a questionable forward pass ruling against Warriors skipper Tuivasa-Sheck which denied a potentially match-winning try. The New Zealand TAB has backed up George\u2019s sentiment, saying it will refund $NZ44,000 worth of bets on the Warriors from the game, labelling it a \u201cjustice payout\u201d. NRL: Bulldogs 6-14 Roosters Twenty-three minutes to go and the Bulldogs finally give their fans something to cheer about - Reimis Smith with a try in the corner. Meaney adds the extras. They\u2019ve improved since the break while the Roosters still look like they\u2019re happy to do just enough to win. It\u2019s still shaping into a routine victory - but if the Bulldogs can grab another, it would really put a cat among the Roosters. AFL: Western Bulldogs veteran Dale Morris has left today\u2019s clash with Fremantle, sparking fears he has seriously re-injured his left knee. Morris ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season but capped a remarkable comeback when he was named for his first AFL match of the season against the Dockers at Marvel Stadium. However, the 36-year-old crumpled to the turf in the third quarter after his left leg buckled under him as he attempted to change direction chasing a ground ball. AAP AFL: 3QT - Western Bulldogs 14.11 (95) - Fremantle Dockers 7.9 (51) If the Bulldogs could play like this every week, they would be right up there instead of dancing around the finals fringes. Then again, not all opponents are as passive as the Dockers have been today - their defence has really let them down. Still another quarter to go but this has been the Dogs\u2019 game since the start of the second. NRL: HT - Bulldogs 0-14 Roosters The Roosters are looking very comfortable it has to be said - although they possibly should be further ahead. They\u2019re certainly more comfortable than Dean Pay must be at the minute. No one seriously expected the Bulldogs to spring a surprise today but this will only add to the speculation surrounding his job - especially if it turns into a big score. One-way traffic. Roosters on cruise control - which is possibly why the lead isn\u2019t bigger. If they were a little more focused, they could rack up a lot of points. Seven points on the day for the Giants, who took their foot off the gas slightly for that final quarter. Fair play to the Magpies who kept battling though. Crucially, the result means the Giants leapfrog the Magpies on the ladder with the finals just in sight. AAP: Giants crush Magpies Giants Netball have moved into Super Netball\u2019s top four after a comprehensive 63-56 victory over Collingwood Magpies. The Magpies went into the clash at Melbourne Arena three points clear of the Giants in fourth spot but the visitors unleashed an 18-9 second-quarter blitz to set up the win. By grabbing three bonus points, the Giants improve to 38 competition points, with the Magpies (35) falling to fifth with four rounds to play in the regular season. While both teams contained a number of players backing up from World Cup duties, it was the Giants\u2019 returning stars who shone the brightest. Diamonds captain Caitlin Bassett (35/38) and English Rose Jo Harten (23/27) fuelled the Giants\u2019 attack while Jamie-Lee Price added 21 goal assists. The Magpies grabbed an early advantage thanks to five unanswered goals but Harten ensured the Giants secured the first bonus point, drilling 10 of her 11 shots for a 16-14 lead after one quarter. But it all unravelled for the home side in the second term as the Giants punished a series of Magpies turnovers, extending their edge to 34-23 at half-time. NRL: While we\u2019re on rugby league, just thought I\u2019d bring you the latest in the Mark Coyne debacle. Or rather, the latest in the post-Mark Coyne debacle. AAP: Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter Beattie has flagged a fresh push for reform as the game seeks a replacement for Mark Coyne. Former Queensland and St George great Coyne fell on his sword on Saturday night, resigning from the commission after his arrest for a drunken, expletive-ridden tirade at Singapore police almost two months ago. Coyne had met with Beattie and was told only a small majority of the 16 NRL clubs supported him staying. Beattie said a replacement would likely be in place late in the year and was adamant the commission wouldn\u2019t be rushed.Under current laws, anyone who holds an NRL club job must wait three years after leaving it before being allowed to join the commission. Beattie indicated his desire to scrap the rule and put it on the agenda when the ARLC meets next month. He said it was not in the game\u2019s interest to exclude experienced administrators just because they had recent involvement with clubs. \u201cIt gives us an opportunity to have a look at the rules. One of the rules that I don\u2019t agree with is the three-year disqualification rule,\u201d Beattie said. \u201cIn other words if you are associated, like Darren Lockyer is with the Broncos, you can\u2019t be considered as a commissioner. Or if you\u2019ve association with the Rabbitohs like Nick Pappas, you can\u2019t be considered as a commissioner. Or (Melbourne chairman Bart Campbell) or any of them. What we\u2019re doing is excluding a whole lot of talented people who could sit on the commission. They\u2019d have to leave the club they\u2019re with.\u201d NRL: Bulldogs 0-14 Roosters We\u2019re just over 12 minutes away from half-time and it\u2019s all going according to script. Manu crashes over the line to extend the Roosters\u2019 lead, and Mitchell adds two more with the boot from the edge. They\u2019re just starting to get away from Canterbury. Netball: 3QT - Magpies 34-52 Giants The Giants win the quarter and extend their lead (slightly). Some important league points being won here in the context of the season with both teams scrapping for a spot in the top four. Cycling: I mentioned him briefly in the preamble, but this is my official \u201chats off\u201d to Egan Bernal on the eve of his Tour de France victory. A strange end to a genuinely tight contest for once. AFL: HT - Western Bulldogs 12.6 (78) - Fremantle 5.5 (35) It\u2019s looking pretty grim at the main break for the Dockers. The Bulldogs dominating the midfield, dominating all over to be fair. Poor old Fremantle, even wasting one last chance to give them a glimmer - skewing it wide and short. It\u2019s all Bulldogs at the minute. The Dockers will need to come out firing if they want to get back into this. Netball: HT - Magpies 23-34 Giants Speaking of netball. It was pretty tight there for a while but the Giants have blown out to a healthy lead at the break. They\u2019ve just come back out for the third quarter. Netball: I\u2019m sure there are more than a few netball fans out there who have been keeping an eye out for injuries and fatigue this weekend after the quick turnaround from the World Cup final. Some excellent points below from Sharni Layton. The mental health issue is particularly interesting, especially with regards to Diamonds players after that agonising one-point defeat in the final. Swimming: It\u2019s not exactly been a great 24 hours for Australia at the world championships, and the news about Shayna Jack\u2019s positive test for a banned substance clearly had an emotional effect on Arairne Titmus yesterday - not great when you\u2019re preparing to take on a revenge-driven Katie Ledecky. Regardless, it\u2019s still been a brilliant few days for Titmus. Well played that woman. Bring on the Olympics. AAP: Revenge was sweet for American great Katie Ledecky as she finally overcame illness to triumph over Ariarne Titmus at the world swimming titles in South Korea. But being relegated to 800m freestyle bronze was not what upset the Australian teenager at Gwangju on Saturday. Titmus was clearly emotional as she left the pool, not stopping for reporters after news broke about her training partner Shayna Jack\u2019s positive test for a banned substance. The Dolphins had plenty to celebrate on the second last night of the world titles, also adding 4x100m mixed freestyle silver and 200m backstroke silver to their growing tally. However, the news about Jack clearly rocked Dolphins teammates particularly Titmus who trains with the 20-year-old under mentor Dean Boxall in Brisbane. Titmus still had plenty to be proud about despite Ledecky finally avenging her shock 400m freestyle loss to the Australian at the start of the meet. Ledecky missed the 200m and 1500m after she succumbed to a stomach bug following her rare defeat at the hands of Titmus. Before the race Ledecky had not been beaten over 400m, 800m or 1500m at a major meet since 2012. Ledecky returned from her sick bed, only for Titmus to again help relegate the American to silver in Thursday\u2019s 4x200m freestyle relay final with Australia claiming a stunning gold. But Ledecky finally got her revenge as she claimed her fourth straight 800m world title, finishing almost one and a half seconds ahead of Italy\u2019s Simona Quadrella. Ledecky became the fourth woman to win a specific individual event four times, joining Hungary\u2019s Katinka Hosszu, Italy\u2019s Federica Pellegrini and Swede Sarah Sjostrom. Titmus claimed bronze in eight minutes, 15.70 seconds - an Oceania record. Afternoon everyone, it may be the end of the weekend but don\u2019t be too downbeat because before we reach Monday morning, there\u2019s still a mountain of sport to climb. Where\u2019s Egan Bernal when you need him? AFL and NRL action dominates the day, but there\u2019s also a smattering of Super Netball thrown in as normal service resumes after the World Cup. In fact, the Giants and Magpies clash, which features a host of players recently returned from Liverpool, is coming up to half-time. I\u2019ll bring you an update shortly. The Vixens take on the Thunderbirds this afternoon too. In the AFL, the Bulldogs and Dockers are under way in a battle both teams need to win to keep their finals hopes alive. After that, the Swans host a Cats side eager to regain their imperious, ladder-leading form after some recent stumbles. Rounding out the AFL action is the Suns game against the Bombers, which in terms of form could not be more lopsided. I sense another long afternoon for Gold Coast fans. Speaking of mismatches, in the NRL we\u2019re about to start in the game between the Roosters and the Bulldogs. After that, we\u2019re off to Panthers Stadium for Penrith\u2019s game against the Raiders. Of course there\u2019s also women\u2019s Ashes action, the Tour de France conclusion and more besides, but I\u2019ll be logged off by then. So there you go, enough sport to fill a stadium-sized hole in the middle of Sydney. Someone call Gladys Berejiklian.

      "bodyText": "The Tour de France brings highs and lows for the riders, both in their emotions and the scenery they ride through. This year\u2019s edition started in Brussels, Belgium, on July 6 and concluded in the French capital, Paris, with a procession over the cobblestones at sunset. Along the way, the riders have had to contend with a variety of terrains, disciplines and weather, as well as the noise of the enthusiastic fans that line the route. Click on the images and then the \u2018i\u2019 icons for caption info. Weather hazards Workers had to use diggers to clear the road on the 19th stage between Saint Jean De Maurienne and Tignes. Organisers stopped the stage for the riders\u2019 safety when a sudden, violent storm, which brought snow and hail, made the route through the Alps too dangerous. The riders had to deal with rain in earlier stages too, along with temperatures that exceeded 40\u00b0C. Time-trials Two of the 21 stages in the race were time-trials \u2013 stage two was a team time-trial, and stage 13 was an individual time trial \u2013 where the riders raced against the clock rather than each other. For this reason, it is often called the \u2018race of truth\u2019 as winning depends only on each rider\u2019s strength and endurance. Enthusiastic fans The Tour would be a duller and quieter spectacle if it didn\u2019t attract the thousands of fans who gather along the route of each stage. Town and country The riders have encountered a variety of environments: from the crowded streets of the cities, to empty countryside roads lined with lavender, to mountainous peaks such as the feared Col du Tourmalet. A splash of colour The Tour wouldn\u2019t be the same without the colourful fans that provide both noise and eccentricity. Joy and pain The Tour is one of the toughest physical tests in all of sport, and it takes a massive toll on the riders\u2019 bodies. While a select few riders experience the joy of a stage victory, many more experience the pain of defeat. This year\u2019s GC winner, Egan Bernal, rode into Paris on Sunday evening to claim his first ever Tour victory, hand-in-hand with last year\u2019s champion Geraint Thomas.",

      "body": "<p>Florida was on a knife-edge during the 2016 US presidential election. Almost every poll had it too close to call. In the final few weeks before the vote, a rash of ads appeared on radio and TV claiming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a> was too frail, too liberal and too ethically compromised to become president.</p> <p>Dr Dareld Morris, the owner of a small medical clinic in Florida, recorded and paid for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xf2Ot9Vok0\" title=\"\">his own anti-Clinton ad</a>.

When then-attorney general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeff-sessions\" title=\"\">Jeff Sessions</a> suddenly became more active in trying to prosecute White House leakers, Republican congressman Matt Gaetz suggested he\u2019d started \u201ctaking those supplements for low-T\u201d.</p> <p>During the campaign, Trump\u2019s own testosterone levels were revealed during a special episode of the talkshow <em><a href=\"https://www.doctoroz.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Oz</a></em>, certainly a presidential first. The audience whooped and cheered as Oz confirmed that Trump\u2019s T-score of 441 was \u201cgood\u201d.</p> <p><em><strong>Politicians have long </strong></em>believed that demonstrating physical strength projects strength as a leader. But the obsession with testosterone is about more than being able to win in a fight. Testosterone is an often-misunderstood hormone, present in both men and women. It plays an important role in sexual function and having a lot of it can help you build muscle, but it also helps with cognition, energy and mood. People with low testosterone are more likely to have multiple chronic health conditions (although researchers argue that a causal link has not been proven). So saying someone has low testosterone taps into a murky mix of insecurities: about not being manly, lacking assertiveness and being unable to satisfy sexually.</p> <p>In reality, levels of testosterone are far more complex to understand. Only a small percentage of total testosterone molecules are \u201cfree\u201d to be used by the body, and levels change constantly depending on your mood, time of day and other environmental factors. Nor is it true that testosterone makes you more athletic \u2013 this issue has come to a head in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/caster-semenya\" title=\"\">Caster Semenya</a>. But the IAAF\u2019s own analysis of 1,100 female runners found that in three of the 11 running events, women with lower testosterone performed better than those with higher levels.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One activist says: \u2018The movement to empower women has gone too far\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The truth is that most men experience a decline in testosterone levels from around the age of 30 and, until recently, most people thought of having low testosterone as part of a kind of \u201cmale menopause\u201d, an issue for older men with waning libidos. But this new, politicised, understanding of testosterone isn\u2019t just about ageing. It\u2019s succinctly explained in a video entitled The Truth About Soy Boys made by Paul Joseph Watson, a member of Ukip and one of the shining lights of Britain\u2019s alt-right community.</p> <p>Watson demonstrates that many of the politically correct left-wingers he despises are also committed vegans and argues that because foods like soya milk and tofu contain oestrogen, and oestrogen lowers testosterone, they are making vegans more feminine and therefore more liberal \u2013 or as he puts it: \u201cBuzzfeed-watching, tofu-eating, male-feminist virtue-signalling, beta-orbiter soy boys.\u201d</p> <p>It seems like this is just a churlish new way to mock political opponents, but there is a scientific backdrop to the banter. A 2007 study shows that average levels of testosterone in the main population have been going down considerably, so that, for example, men who were 50 in 1988 had higher testosterone concentrations than did comparable 50-year-old men in 1996. The study hypothesises that levels could be dropping by as much as 1% a year. </p> <p>In other words, men as a group are becoming softer and there\u2019s science to prove it. To reverse the trend, we just need to boost our testosterone. What could be better grist for the mill for those trying to make America great again or take back control?</p> <p><em><strong>Big pharma has</strong></em> been quick to offer miracle cures to this apparent ill. I first came across this strange linking between Trumpish rhetoric and hormone treatments watching TV adverts in America. One, for a product called Ageless Male, asks: \u201cWhen did it become OK for men to become softer, lazier, weaker?\u201d The same brand offers a free month\u2019s trial if you text the promo code \u201cwimp\u201d to its hotline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29acea2ca8e9745407c3be4b918e70b98c0e5fb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29acea2ca8e9745407c3be4b918e70b98c0e5fb3/0_720_8272_4963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Wolfson- testosterone magazine feature\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharp practice: sales of testosterone testing kits have risen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since those adverts began, there\u2019s been an increase in the number of men seeking to boost their testosterone levels. In the US, more than 1 million men have been getting new tests for testosterone levels and more than 283,000 initiated testosterone treatment in a four-year period.</p> <p>That impact is being felt in the UK, too. High-street pharmacies, as well as online start-ups, are now offering testosterone testing, letting men do at-home blood tests to help satiate or stoke their fears.</p> <p>Superdrug says it has seen the number of requests per week for the kits more than double since February. More people are going to their doctor with their worries, too, and NHS prescriptions for testosterone increased by 20% in the four years after 2012.</p> <p>Stricter controls on television advertising in the UK mean that pro-testosterone thinking is being stoked in books and online. The charge is led by Daniel Kelly, a fitness coach from Stoke-on-Trent who has written his own book advocating testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT) for young people. It\u2019s called <em>Optimized Under 35: How to Boost Your Testosterone, Increase Your Sex Drive and Achieve Incredible Health</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018It gives you acne and shrinks your balls, but there are no risks\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kelly\u2019s book is typical of the way testosterone devotees like to blend their version of science with a conservative worldview. In the introduction he talks about how testosterone use helped him with his anxiety and libido, and promises that the book will advise any reader how to reap the same benefits. Much of the book includes highly technical hormone advice and references to scientific studies.</p> <p>But the science is blended with sentiments more familiar to late-night listeners of LBC. \u201cThe movement to empower women has swung the pendulum too far,\u201d he writes. \u201cYoung men are brainwashed with anti-male vitriol\u2026\u201d and so on.</p> <p>Kelly sees this not just as a crisis of masculinity, but a crisis of testosterone; indeed he says the two are \u201cinseparable\u201d. In one passage he writes: \u201cThis low-T reality has infested many areas of society to the point that it\u2019s unacceptable to bring up traditional or conservative views in polite conversation\u2026 make no mistake, it\u2019s not \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019 that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s the toxic progressive ideology that hates anything masculine that poses a real problem to society.\u201d</p> <p>It would be easy to dismiss this as meninist nonsense, yet a part of me also thinks I would feel quietly emasculated if I were to discover I had low-T. It makes me think of the way false versions of femininity have long been measured in expensive grooming regimes and unrealistic body types. Even politically aware feminists can still feel inadequate staring at a size-zero model. Those are pressures that men have found it easier to avoid. Yet now, here we are creating our own field in which to feel deficient and unmanly \u2013 one which is completely invisible.</p> <p>To find out where I stand, I order a \u00a350 T-testing kit from Superdrug. Soon there are <em>Sweeney Todd</em>-like scenes at my kitchen table as I try to produce enough blood from a series of pinpricks to fill a vial. \u201cBabes, you\u2019ve got to milk your finger!\u201d shouts my girlfriend as she tries to scoop blood into the plastic tube. I\u2019ve always been told my bald head, monstrous body hair and speedy facial hair growth are classic signs of high testosterone. I send off the sample relatively confident I don\u2019t have any of the symptoms associated with low-T.</p> <p>While I wait for the results, I try to find out if there\u2019s any actual scientific proof behind the fears that we\u2019re not getting enough testosterone. I speak to Rebecca M Jordan-Young, a sociomedical scientist at Barnard College, Columbia University, and co-author of the forthcoming book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Testosterone-Unauthorized-Biography-Rebecca-Jordan-Young/dp/0674725328\" title=\"\">Testosterone: an Unauthorised Biography</a></em>. I am not surprised when she tells me that much of the received wisdom about testosterone is nonsense.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of low-T has been really pushed, but low-T in and of itself is not a problem \u2013 you can have pretty low-T and be getting an awful lot out of that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe average man has so much more testosterone than is needed for sexual functioning. In placebo-controlled, randomised trials, when they start with healthy people who have no complaints\u2026 most trials find no difference in any aspect of mood or cognition or behaviour even at massively high levels of testosterone.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan-Young says that hormones are extremely complex. The idea that ingesting more oestrogen from soy means you have less testosterone is a complete misunderstanding of how hormones work. Indeed, testosterone is often converted into oestrogen, which means that people who routinely inject testosterone often end up growing breasts.</p> <p>Other research has shown that some testosterone treatments, especially those self-administered without regular medical checks, may make men more prone to heart attacks and prostate cancer. Boosting testosterone can also make a man infertile. Jordan-Young says the reason for much of this confusion comes from the misconception that testosterone is \u201cthe male sex hormone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHormones were originally discovered within a research programme that was already set up to characterise them as about masculinity and femininity. It was originally thought that when they did find the \u2018male essence\u2019 it would only be found in male bodies, that it would be detrimental to female bodies and that it would be exclusively about sex-related functions. None of those things turned out to be true, but all of them lived on in our folklore.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true that for people who do have dangerously low testosterone, TRT can be very effective, but we\u2019re probably talking about less than 1% of men. For everyone else, the biggest impact TRT can have is a massive placebo effect.</p> <p>Jordan-Young says there is little solid evidence of a testosterone decline in men. Even the claim that men have less testosterone now than they did a generation ago is doubtful. Studies are conflicting: some say there\u2019s no decline at all; a couple say there\u2019s a small but statistically significant decline over time. But the best population-based data from the US doesn\u2019t show any decline in men.</p> <p><em><strong>Yet in this </strong></em>strange world in which endocrinology has overlapped with gender politics, the myth has spread faster than any scientific approach. Many healthy men believe they need more testosterone, not least because there are some men for whom TRT can be life-changing.</p> <p>Some of them are treated by Dr Richard Petty, who runs the <a href=\"https://www.wellmanclinic.org/\" title=\"\">Wellman Clinic</a>. Petty is a fantastically posh doctor who calls his secretaries \u201cthe girls\u201d and has an office on Harley Street as big as my flat. He began specialising in men\u2019s health after running a private clinic in the 1970s in Chelsea. When the recession and the three-day week hit, his patients could no longer afford to live in the area \u2013 as he puts it: \u201cThey had to live in their country houses or move to Putney\u201d \u2013 so the wives and children got new doctors in the suburbs and he kept \u201cthe chaps\u201d.</p> <p>He began dealing more with prostate cancer, learning about testosterone and publishing on its importance. He\u2019s rather more bullish than Jordan-Young about the prospects of TRT for transforming lives.</p> <p>I ask whether he can tell when someone comes through the door whether they have low testosterone. \u201cAbsolutely, I can see from the street. You get anaemic, you see. So they\u2019re pale. Even if they\u2019re brown they\u2019re not pink. Arteries in the face are less dilated than they would be otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Petty says for a number of the patients he sees, TRT can not only perk up their sex life but lead to major improvements in mental health, lifting a depression that they have previously been unable to treat effectively.</p> <p>I ask about my own test and he says he\u2019s very dubious about online laboratories, saying they can be as much as 15% off. Still, I\u2019m only hoping for a very rough idea. He tells me that seriously low-T would be a score of less than 13: \u201cThat\u2019s one-star petrol.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Armed with a new</strong></em> understanding of how testosterone works, I give Daniel Kelly a ring, hoping to convince him that men under 35 don\u2019t need to get involved with testosterone boosting. He\u2019s jollier than I expected, although occasionally says things like: \u201cSociety is trying to pigeonhole men almost into behaving like women.\u201d</p> <p>He explains that he now injects testosterone directly twice a week and plans to do so for the rest of his life. He did have quite low testosterone levels to begin with, but says he\u2019s not concerned simply about remedying low testosterone, but having an optimum level.</p> <p>I explain what Jordan-Young has said, that optimum testosterone isn\u2019t real and your body can do a lot with a little T, and Kelly groans. \u201cMainstream doctors think it\u2019s fine, as long as the hormones are in an arbitrary range made up by someone in an ivory tower who doesn\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s an arbitrary reference range that they made up. There\u2019s a big difference between normal health and optimal health. It\u2019s going to take some balancing, but what\u2019s the alternative: feel like crap because you\u2019re in some arbitrary reference range?\u201d</p> <p>He quotes studies at me that refute the link between testosterone and prostate cancer. He says over-the-counter hormone boosters can be dangerous, but he only advocates prescription TRT that \u201cshrinks your balls\u201d and gives you acne, and otherwise he believes \u201cthere are no risks\u201d.</p> <p>He accepts that some people don\u2019t need TRT and it should be a last resort after changes to diet, getting fit and giving up booze. Yet he still believes many men \u2013 not just men with severe symptoms, or men who doctors believe have dangerously low-T \u2013 would be happier if they increased their T-levels artificially, even though it means they\u2019ll have to do so for the rest of their lives. \u201cLow testosterone makes men more meek and lacking in confidence, and the honest truth is if you walk down the street most men won\u2019t even give you a strong handshake.\u201d</p> <p>As so often happens when science and politics collide, there are some slivers of truth hidden beneath a lot of nonsense. Testosterone can be transformative for those lacking it. But the idea that any kind of crisis of masculinity has been caused by lower testosterone in the population is a fiction, wished into existence by those peddling right-wing pseudoscience.</p> <p>Or so I had convinced myself, right up until my T results land in my inbox. I\u2019m shocked. I\u2019m in the one-star petrol category, with a score my \u201cSuperdrug doctor\u201d describes as \u201cwithin the normal range, but at the lower end\u201d. Despite not experiencing any of the associated problems with low testosterone, I honestly feel ashamed of my T-score. My logical brain might know I shouldn\u2019t be worried, but I find myself flicking back through Kelly\u2019s book, looking for advice. Maybe I do struggle to concentrate. Who doesn\u2019t feel a bit lethargic sometimes? If testosterone insecurity has been manufactured out of nowhere over the past decade, it\u2019s certainly working on me. Superdrug says I should do a second test to make sure of the result. I immediately start Googling to find a company that will give me a second opinion \u2013 and hopefully a better result.</p>",

Only a small percentage of total testosterone molecules are \u201cfree\u201d to be used by the body, and levels change constantly depending on your mood, time of day and other environmental factors. Nor is it true that testosterone makes you more athletic \u2013 this issue has come to a head in the case of Caster Semenya. But the IAAF\u2019s own analysis of 1,100 female runners found that in three of the 11 running events, women with lower testosterone performed better than those with higher levels. The truth is that most men experience a decline in testosterone levels from around the age of 30 and, until recently, most people thought of having low testosterone as part of a kind of \u201cmale menopause\u201d, an issue for older men with waning libidos. But this new, politicised, understanding of testosterone isn\u2019t just about ageing. It\u2019s succinctly explained in a video entitled The Truth About Soy Boys made by Paul Joseph Watson, a member of Ukip and one of the shining lights of Britain\u2019s alt-right community. Watson demonstrates that many of the politically correct left-wingers he despises are also committed vegans and argues that because foods like soya milk and tofu contain oestrogen, and oestrogen lowers testosterone, they are making vegans more feminine and therefore more liberal \u2013 or as he puts it: \u201cBuzzfeed-watching, tofu-eating, male-feminist virtue-signalling, beta-orbiter soy boys.\u201d It seems like this is just a churlish new way to mock political opponents, but there is a scientific backdrop to the banter. A 2007 study shows that average levels of testosterone in the main population have been going down considerably, so that, for example, men who were 50 in 1988 had higher testosterone concentrations than did comparable 50-year-old men in 1996. The study hypothesises that levels could be dropping by as much as 1% a year. In other words, men as a group are becoming softer and there\u2019s science to prove it. To reverse the trend, we just need to boost our testosterone. What could be better grist for the mill for those trying to make America great again or take back control? Big pharma has been quick to offer miracle cures to this apparent ill. I first came across this strange linking between Trumpish rhetoric and hormone treatments watching TV adverts in America. One, for a product called Ageless Male, asks: \u201cWhen did it become OK for men to become softer, lazier, weaker?\u201d The same brand offers a free month\u2019s trial if you text the promo code \u201cwimp\u201d to its hotline. Since those adverts began, there\u2019s been an increase in the number of men seeking to boost their testosterone levels. In the US, more than 1 million men have been getting new tests for testosterone levels and more than 283,000 initiated testosterone treatment in a four-year period. That impact is being felt in the UK, too. High-street pharmacies, as well as online start-ups, are now offering testosterone testing, letting men do at-home blood tests to help satiate or stoke their fears. Superdrug says it has seen the number of requests per week for the kits more than double since February. More people are going to their doctor with their worries, too, and NHS prescriptions for testosterone increased by 20% in the four years after 2012. Stricter controls on television advertising in the UK mean that pro-testosterone thinking is being stoked in books and online. The charge is led by Daniel Kelly, a fitness coach from Stoke-on-Trent who has written his own book advocating testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT) for young people. It\u2019s called Optimized Under 35: How to Boost Your Testosterone, Increase Your Sex Drive and Achieve Incredible Health. Kelly\u2019s book is typical of the way testosterone devotees like to blend their version of science with a conservative worldview. In the introduction he talks about how testosterone use helped him with his anxiety and libido, and promises that the book will advise any reader how to reap the same benefits. Much of the book includes highly technical hormone advice and references to scientific studies. But the science is blended with sentiments more familiar to late-night listeners of LBC. \u201cThe movement to empower women has swung the pendulum too far,\u201d he writes. \u201cYoung men are brainwashed with anti-male vitriol\u2026\u201d and so on. Kelly sees this not just as a crisis of masculinity, but a crisis of testosterone; indeed he says the two are \u201cinseparable\u201d. In one passage he writes: \u201cThis low-T reality has infested many areas of society to the point that it\u2019s unacceptable to bring up traditional or conservative views in polite conversation\u2026 make no mistake, it\u2019s not \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019 that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s the toxic progressive ideology that hates anything masculine that poses a real problem to society.\u201d It would be easy to dismiss this as meninist nonsense, yet a part of me also thinks I would feel quietly emasculated if I were to discover I had low-T. It makes me think of the way false versions of femininity have long been measured in expensive grooming regimes and unrealistic body types. Even politically aware feminists can still feel inadequate staring at a size-zero model. Those are pressures that men have found it easier to avoid. Yet now, here we are creating our own field in which to feel deficient and unmanly \u2013 one which is completely invisible. To find out where I stand, I order a \u00a350 T-testing kit from Superdrug. Soon there are Sweeney Todd-like scenes at my kitchen table as I try to produce enough blood from a series of pinpricks to fill a vial. \u201cBabes, you\u2019ve got to milk your finger!\u201d shouts my girlfriend as she tries to scoop blood into the plastic tube. I\u2019ve always been told my bald head, monstrous body hair and speedy facial hair growth are classic signs of high testosterone. I send off the sample relatively confident I don\u2019t have any of the symptoms associated with low-T. While I wait for the results, I try to find out if there\u2019s any actual scientific proof behind the fears that we\u2019re not getting enough testosterone. I speak to Rebecca M Jordan-Young, a sociomedical scientist at Barnard College, Columbia University, and co-author of the forthcoming book, Testosterone: an Unauthorised Biography. I am not surprised when she tells me that much of the received wisdom about testosterone is nonsense. \u201cThe idea of low-T has been really pushed, but low-T in and of itself is not a problem \u2013 you can have pretty low-T and be getting an awful lot out of that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe average man has so much more testosterone than is needed for sexual functioning. In placebo-controlled, randomised trials, when they start with healthy people who have no complaints\u2026 most trials find no difference in any aspect of mood or cognition or behaviour even at massively high levels of testosterone.\u201d Jordan-Young says that hormones are extremely complex. The idea that ingesting more oestrogen from soy means you have less testosterone is a complete misunderstanding of how hormones work. Indeed, testosterone is often converted into oestrogen, which means that people who routinely inject testosterone often end up growing breasts. Other research has shown that some testosterone treatments, especially those self-administered without regular medical checks, may make men more prone to heart attacks and prostate cancer. Boosting testosterone can also make a man infertile. Jordan-Young says the reason for much of this confusion comes from the misconception that testosterone is \u201cthe male sex hormone\u201d. \u201cHormones were originally discovered within a research programme that was already set up to characterise them as about masculinity and femininity. It was originally thought that when they did find the \u2018male essence\u2019 it would only be found in male bodies, that it would be detrimental to female bodies and that it would be exclusively about sex-related functions. None of those things turned out to be true, but all of them lived on in our folklore.\u201d It\u2019s true that for people who do have dangerously low testosterone, TRT can be very effective, but we\u2019re probably talking about less than 1% of men. For everyone else, the biggest impact TRT can have is a massive placebo effect. Jordan-Young says there is little solid evidence of a testosterone decline in men. Even the claim that men have less testosterone now than they did a generation ago is doubtful. Studies are conflicting: some say there\u2019s no decline at all; a couple say there\u2019s a small but statistically significant decline over time. But the best population-based data from the US doesn\u2019t show any decline in men. Yet in this strange world in which endocrinology has overlapped with gender politics, the myth has spread faster than any scientific approach. Many healthy men believe they need more testosterone, not least because there are some men for whom TRT can be life-changing. Some of them are treated by Dr Richard Petty, who runs the Wellman Clinic. Petty is a fantastically posh doctor who calls his secretaries \u201cthe girls\u201d and has an office on Harley Street as big as my flat. He began specialising in men\u2019s health after running a private clinic in the 1970s in Chelsea. When the recession and the three-day week hit, his patients could no longer afford to live in the area \u2013 as he puts it: \u201cThey had to live in their country houses or move to Putney\u201d \u2013 so the wives and children got new doctors in the suburbs and he kept \u201cthe chaps\u201d. He began dealing more with prostate cancer, learning about testosterone and publishing on its importance. He\u2019s rather more bullish than Jordan-Young about the prospects of TRT for transforming lives. I ask whether he can tell when someone comes through the door whether they have low testosterone. \u201cAbsolutely, I can see from the street. You get anaemic, you see. So they\u2019re pale. Even if they\u2019re brown they\u2019re not pink. Arteries in the face are less dilated than they would be otherwise.\u201d Petty says for a number of the patients he sees, TRT can not only perk up their sex life but lead to major improvements in mental health, lifting a depression that they have previously been unable to treat effectively. I ask about my own test and he says he\u2019s very dubious about online laboratories, saying they can be as much as 15% off. Still, I\u2019m only hoping for a very rough idea. He tells me that seriously low-T would be a score of less than 13: \u201cThat\u2019s one-star petrol.\u201d Armed with a new understanding of how testosterone works, I give Daniel Kelly a ring, hoping to convince him that men under 35 don\u2019t need to get involved with testosterone boosting. He\u2019s jollier than I expected, although occasionally says things like: \u201cSociety is trying to pigeonhole men almost into behaving like women.\u201d He explains that he now injects testosterone directly twice a week and plans to do so for the rest of his life. He did have quite low testosterone levels to begin with, but says he\u2019s not concerned simply about remedying low testosterone, but having an optimum level. I explain what Jordan-Young has said, that optimum testosterone isn\u2019t real and your body can do a lot with a little T, and Kelly groans. \u201cMainstream doctors think it\u2019s fine, as long as the hormones are in an arbitrary range made up by someone in an ivory tower who doesn\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s an arbitrary reference range that they made up. There\u2019s a big difference between normal health and optimal health. It\u2019s going to take some balancing, but what\u2019s the alternative: feel like crap because you\u2019re in some arbitrary reference range?\u201d He quotes studies at me that refute the link between testosterone and prostate cancer. He says over-the-counter hormone boosters can be dangerous, but he only advocates prescription TRT that \u201cshrinks your balls\u201d and gives you acne, and otherwise he believes \u201cthere are no risks\u201d. He accepts that some people don\u2019t need TRT and it should be a last resort after changes to diet, getting fit and giving up booze. Yet he still believes many men \u2013 not just men with severe symptoms, or men who doctors believe have dangerously low-T \u2013 would be happier if they increased their T-levels artificially, even though it means they\u2019ll have to do so for the rest of their lives. \u201cLow testosterone makes men more meek and lacking in confidence, and the honest truth is if you walk down the street most men won\u2019t even give you a strong handshake.\u201d As so often happens when science and politics collide, there are some slivers of truth hidden beneath a lot of nonsense. Testosterone can be transformative for those lacking it. But the idea that any kind of crisis of masculinity has been caused by lower testosterone in the population is a fiction, wished into existence by those peddling right-wing pseudoscience. Or so I had convinced myself, right up until my T results land in my inbox. I\u2019m shocked. I\u2019m in the one-star petrol category, with a score my \u201cSuperdrug doctor\u201d describes as \u201cwithin the normal range, but at the lower end\u201d. Despite not experiencing any of the associated problems with low testosterone, I honestly feel ashamed of my T-score. My logical brain might know I shouldn\u2019t be worried, but I find myself flicking back through Kelly\u2019s book, looking for advice. Maybe I do struggle to concentrate. Who doesn\u2019t feel a bit lethargic sometimes? If testosterone insecurity has been manufactured out of nowhere over the past decade, it\u2019s certainly working on me. Superdrug says I should do a second test to make sure of the result. I immediately start Googling to find a company that will give me a second opinion \u2013 and hopefully a better result.",

The big theme it forces you to contemplate is that people\u2019s decisions are only as good as their options. If you carry any preconception around such issues as abortion or the opioid crisis, I think you walk away less judgmental. 2. Book Finding My Voice by Valerie Jarrett I really enjoyed reading this memoir that trails Jarrett\u2019s journey into the White House and beyond. It humanises one of the most powerful female figures of our time in the political sphere \u2013 she remains the most trusted adviser to the Obamas. And she has such an interesting background: she was born in Iran, because her father, a black doctor, could not find any opportunities to practise medicine in America during the civil rights era. For much of her career she kept a relatively low profile, so it was wonderful to have her open up about where she came from. 3. Music Heard It in a Past Life by Maggie Rogers I\u2019ve been listening to this album on repeat every single day, annoying everyone around me. It\u2019s a freeing, uplifting album, and the strength of story in her lyrics is so profound for a woman of her age. I find myself dancing all around the house every time I turn it on: it just puts me in a good mood. I\u2019m one of her biggest fans \u2013 I\u2019ve just purchased tickets to take my fiance to go see her in concert in New York in October. So I\u2019m excited about that. 4. Fashion Brother Vellies Aurora James is the designer behind this shoe and handbag accessories line. She\u2019s so inspiring \u2013 she has a very sustainable approach to fashion. Her whole ethos is about elevating local artisans from all over the world, specifically Africa, who are paid a livable wage. Everything is colourful and kind of \u201cmore is more\u201d: it reminds me of the sort of woman I wanted to be when I was a little girl \u2013 like Blanche from The Golden Girls \u2013 women who love luxurious fabrics and prints and feathers, but done through an artisanal lens. 5. Podcast Still Processing It\u2019s my go-to podcast while I\u2019m in the shower \u2013 I love to use that time to think. It\u2019s produced by two New York Times culture writers, Jenna Wortham and Wesley Morris. It\u2019s like listening in on a phone call between two of your smartest friends about everything you\u2019re listening to, thinking about, talking about \u2013 such as the Michael Jackson documentary or social justice issues. In one episode they talk about the culture of aunties, thinking about all of the most iconic aunties in film history. Their perspective is always enlightening, well-researched and really funny. 6. TV When They See Us (Netflix) This is Ava DuVernay\u2019s new project, about the Central Park Five. It was a story that rocked America in the late 80s of five black teenage boys who were accused of crimes they did not commit. It shows how they became victims of the criminal justice system, and it\u2019s really eye-opening and heart-wrenching. I don\u2019t recommend binge-watching this series: it\u2019s best enjoyed like an IV drip, one drop at a time, and then you need to walk away to process what you\u2019ve just seen. But it\u2019s incredible: even though it\u2019s hard to watch, it\u2019s too important to miss.",

      "body": "<p>By now, we know reunion culture is a con. The brief excitement of seeing a favourite band re-form is swiftly tempered by watching them resentfully trot out the hits and confront their mortality. Plus, the past is no longer a novelty but our perpetual groundhog day of recycled franchises and rebooted brands.</p> <p>Which is why Sleater-Kinney\u2019s surprise return, in 2015, nine years after they went on hiatus, was so refreshing. Not content to rehash old glories, the feminist punks had a brilliant new album, the riotous, new wavy <em>No Cities to Love</em>, and singer-guitarists Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker and drummer Janet Weiss were unabashedly vocal about ending the dearth of fortysomething women in rock.</p> <p>Even better, it turned out not to be a one-off. This January, news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/02/st-vincent-review-live-cambridge-masseduction\" title=\"\">St Vincent</a>, AKA Annie Clark, had produced their new album \u201cbroke the internet\u201d, said US indie bible Pitchfork, sounding slightly awed by the \u201cendless possibilities of what this collaboration might sound like\u201d. \u201cEndless possibilities\u201d was on the money: <em>The Center Won\u2019t </em><em>Hold</em> is Sleater-Kinney\u2019s most diverse album, bursting with vaudevillian romps about how women are naturals at handling chaos, industrial demands for carnal and spiritual satisfaction, Tom Petty-indebted balladry couching admissions of betrayal and rousing choruses made to yell at last orders.</p> <p>In mid-June, I am due to meet the trio to discuss their second second coming over lunch in Portland, Oregon, but I get an email hours beforehand saying Weiss is ill. Tucker arrives at the neighbourhood spot first, her striped earrings matching her monochrome T-shirt. It\u2019s a shame about Weiss, I say. \u201cYeah,\u201d Tucker says with a sigh, looking at the sky. \u201cIt is.\u201d Brownstein appears, tiny and shaggily glam in a grey felted jacket. We head into the restaurant, which is straight out of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/27/portlandia-box-set-review\" title=\"\">Portlandia</a></em>, the now concluded Emmy-winning satire of life in the zealously artisanal city that Brownstein wrote and starred in. She orders fish stew, while Tucker orders cornbread and asks the waiter what their \u201czero food print\u201d certification means. It\u2019s a programme funding climate-friendly farming, we learn, as Michael Jackson plays over the stereo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are fewer stories in popular music by women of a certain age</p> <footer> <cite>Carrie Brownstein</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They laugh at the ethical absurdity. Tucker and Brownstein are Sleater-Kinney\u2019s songwriters and their 25-year friendship is seductive. They\u2019re as goofy as they are deferential, less serious than you might imagine \u2013 Brownstein\u2019s grin occupies half her face and Tucker frequently detonates an explosive laugh. This new album is a bit of a fluke, they explain. Last spring, Brownstein was developing an adaptation of her 2015 memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/10/hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl-carrie-brownstein-review-sleater-kinney\" title=\"\">Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl</a></em> for TV, a potential post-<em>Portlandia</em> project. The lightly fictionalised show would trace her and Tucker\u2019s search for a drummer in Olympia, Washington, where they met as students who moved to the city to join the early 90s riot grrrl scene.</p> <p>Back then, in real life, the pair flew to Melbourne to meet their first drummer without hearing a beat of her playing. They made two albums with Laura Macfarlane, until the geographical logistics became annoying. Then they found Weiss, who was \u201cthe best decision we ever made\u201d, Brownstein wrote in her memoir. Weiss joined for their third (and first great) album, 1997\u2019s poppy, punchy <em>Dig Me Out</em>. They eclipsed the DIY Olympia scene and became one of America\u2019s most innovative rock bands, subverting girl-group convention and classic rock excess, while Tucker\u2019s astonishing gospel wail gave their work a powerful spiritual urgency. Once fans found out that Tucker and Brownstein had briefly dated, they became queer icons of a sort, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6d151befcded88e9de341c6b88273fed0ec424d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6d151befcded88e9de341c6b88273fed0ec424d/0_0_1367_937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sleater-Kinney in 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Subverting girl-group convention\u2019\u2026 Sleater-Kinney in 2000 (l-r): Carrie Brownstein, Janet Weiss, Corin Tucker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brownstein\u2019s pilot for the show about their early days wasn\u2019t picked up. But if it had succeeded, she says, who knows when they would have had time to make a new album. \u201cI was like, why am I examining music through a historical lens? My relationship to music is right now. That\u2019s more important to me.\u201d</p> <p>That relationship was reinvigorated when they saw young people who missed them first time at their incendiary reunion shows. I went to five of those to make up for lost time; aged 16, I\u2019d bought their single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZA_7FtttRY\" title=\"\">Jumpers</a> on sight. It was on green vinyl and the credits billed three women, which was enough of a USP in the laddy 00s. I was too late \u2013 it turned out to be their last single.</p> <p>Brownstein recently started to think the bar around their 2015 comeback was too low. \u201cThere\u2019s this leeway: oh, it\u2019s not terrible! And it was nothing even close to terrible, but you can sail on the momentum of relieved enthusiasm for a while.\u201d Deciding to continue raises the stakes: the only point, says Tucker, is to do something different. \u201cWanting to play with what we\u2019ve done before, wanting to take risks.\u201d</p> <p>Taking risks can prove, well, risky. Nine days after I meet Tucker and Brownstein, Weiss quits Sleater-Kinney. \u201cThe band is heading in a new direction and it is time for me to move on,\u201d she says in a statement. I track her down and ask if she wants to talk; she considers it, but declines.</p> <p>Tucker and Brownstein sound crushed when we speak the day after Weiss\u2019s news. They admit that she wasn\u2019t unwell the day we met in Portland \u2013 this happened very recently and suddenly and they didn\u2019t know what was going on. They tried band therapy. They won\u2019t speculate on Weiss\u2019s reasoning, although Brownstein says they thought \u201ceveryone was really happy about the record\u201d.</p> <p>But the show will go on. Brownstein says they are as determined to evolve as ever. \u201cAfter these years, it might feel harder to take those risks, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m invested in. Corin and I took ourselves to the opposite side of the world to start Sleater-Kinney. There\u2019s always been something impulsive and scrappy about this band and I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s another way to be in it except to adapt and evolve.\u201d</p> <p>Appropriately, <em>The Center Won\u2019t Hold</em> takes inspiration from an unlikely source \u2013 at least for a punk band. They were driving around listening to Rihanna\u2019s ballad Stay when Brownstein said she wanted to write a song like it. When they started writing in earnest, she was living in Los Angeles, Tucker in Portland (Brownstein later moved back), so they had to work remotely for the first time, giving them space to expand their individual visions.</p> <p>Tucker\u2019s songs are bleaker than Brownstein\u2019s, full of searching and isolation: \u201cDarkness winning again,\u201d she sings on the stormy Reach Out. She was depressed. Tucker had worked for her dad for years, in marketing and web design. When his company was bought by a big corporation, she was let go. \u201cMy brain went: argh, too much,\u201d she says. She sought medication, which helped. She laughs: \u201cIt also gave me the freedom to be like: you\u2019re 100% supposed to be being an artist right now.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xfPoLEJpgY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_xfPoLEJpgY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xfPoLEJpgY\">Watch the video for The Center Won\u2019t Hold by Sleater-Kinney.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Brownstein apologetically ventures a \u201csuper-psychoanalytical\u201d theory. Tucker became a parent before Sleater-Kinney made 2002\u2019s <em>One Beat</em>, one of the period\u2019s few explicitly anti-Bush albums \u2013 Far Away depicted her breastfeeding while watching televised warfare. \u201cRemember your awareness of being a mother and having to be protective of your kids?\u201d Brownstein asks. \u201cYour son is 18, he\u2019s going to college. Not like, \u2018You\u2019re done!\u2019, but it seems like you feel so much more freedom to express anxieties. That\u2019s maybe harder when you\u2019re holding so tight to notions of family.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker agrees. She had worried that being a musician would mess up her kids \u2013 her second was born after the band\u2019s 2006 break \u2013 but with one kid out the door, she feels relief. \u201cIt is really freeing to rage a bit more in my songs.\u201d</p> <p>Not that she\u2019s been sanguine in the interim \u2013 she raged loudly on the last album. Also, what about her 11-year-old daughter? \u201cShe\u2019s raising herself,\u201d Brownstein deadpans. </p> <p>Their relationships have registered the change. Now 46, Tucker says she used to be the care-giver while Brownstein, 44, was needier. (Brownstein describes Weiss, 53, as consistently \u201cno-nonsense\u201d.)</p> <p>\u201cCarrie has really worked on being a very nurturing person,\u201d says Tucker, with comedy largesse. \u201cShe\u2019s very caring.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82f7c890c4cfcc9137e7ac26f0ec99cb047bc7a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82f7c890c4cfcc9137e7ac26f0ec99cb047bc7a2/0_0_3000_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrie Brownstein performing at the Sasquatch! festival in George, Washington, May 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrie Brownstein performing at the Sasquatch! festival in George, Washington, May 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSpeak louder!\u201d Brownstein demands, laughing.</p> <p>Tucker says she has become less nice, although she still insists on sharing her lunch. \u201cI\u2019ve <em>raised</em> two kids, done that, and now I\u2019m more in touch with what I need, what I deserve.\u201d</p> <p>That need rages through Broken, the bluesy piano ballad that took the Rihanna inspiration somewhere very different. It\u2019s a tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her in 1982. \u201cShe stood up for us when she testified me, me too,\u201d Tucker sings, ruefully: \u201cMy body cried out when she spoke those lines.\u201d</p> <p>Kavanaugh was appointed anyway. But one outcome, says Tucker, was positive. \u201cTo say \u2018me too\u2019 means this matters, that you have ownership over what happened to you. It\u2019s OK to say it impacted your life at any age. Men lost their jobs. That\u2019s a big deal. Harvey Weinstein walking to court in handcuffs \u2013 that\u2019s a win.\u201d Still: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough and the legal part is mind-numbingly slow to change.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the backlash is swift. \u201cStraight, white men are in a state of disinheritance from positions of power that they assumed were their inalienable right,\u201d says Brownstein, who gets academic when drawn on intellectual topics. \u201cWhen you have so many people fearful of losing power, what they do to keep it is the brutality we\u2019re living in. Take anti-abortion legislation \u2013 there\u2019s such pushback when there is progress. It is not inevitable.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThose reminders are very desolate.\u201d</p> <p>But Broken aside, <em>The Center Won\u2019t Hold</em> isn\u2019t explicitly political. \u201cIf people thought Sleater-Kinney was gonna put out some loud, anti-Trump record, they would be misguided,\u201d says Brownstein. The restaurant has closed, so we perch outside. Sleater-Kinney have already written those songs, she laughs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been addressing the #MeToo movement and shitty patriarchal systems of injustice and subjugation since 1995!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5uAH0vNn2s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E5uAH0vNn2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Listen to Sleater-Kinney\u2019s Hurry on Home.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>If anything, Trump\u2019s presidency has forced a reconsideration of what makes art \u201cpolitical\u201d. Performing rage was the preserve of punk. Now it\u2019s mainstream discourse. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to want to match that level of hyperbole,\u201d says Brownstein. \u201cEven though I appreciate the spirit of anger, that volume has been claimed by some really terrible people.\u201d Made by four women, the album is inherently \u201cits own political statement\u201d, she says. Tucker brings up Hillary Clinton: \u201cThis squashing of older women is such a part of our patriarchal culture, but it got turned up. We thought, let\u2019s not mellow out at all, let\u2019s take our music and see how much we can expand it, change it.\u201d</p> <p>Hang on \u2013 from singing about rape culture in 1995 to the violence of capitalism on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/18/sleater-kinney-no-cities-to-love-review\" title=\"\">No Cities to Love</a></em>, Sleater-Kinney have never been mellow. Brownstein half-agrees: \u201cThat was the whole creed we came out of \u2013 90s punk-rock feminism \u2013 but the older you get, the scarier it is to actually say you still want to be doing this because there are fewer stories in popular music by women of a certain age. Doing that when we were younger was almost taken for granted. Now you actually have to grab for it, be a little bit greedy and voracious.\u201d</p> <p>Expansive and adventurous, <em>The Center Won\u2019t Hold</em> makes that statement boldly. There\u2019s also the matter of Brownstein\u2019s bare bum being on the cover of single Hurry on Home. She had wanted the whole band to be naked. \u201cThat was a bad idea!\u201d Brownstein admits.</p> <p>Tucker \u2013 and her daughter \u2013 agreed. \u201cI was reading her texts aloud and she was like, \u2018MOM! You\u2019re not DOING THAT!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They cackle. They say they were too shy to celebrate their sexuality in their 20s. Brownstein claims someone once wrote an angry dissertation about a photo where her pants were visible. Plus, says Tucker, \u201cmusic has always been the playground of men\u2019s sexuality. Women have really struggled to claim their own space.\u201d (That\u2019s also why they think #MeToo has barely touched the music industry.)</p> <p>Sexual empowerment is in a state of hyper-evolution: now it would be the writer decrying Brownstein\u2019s knickers who would be considered a traitor. \u201cGender as a construct is now like a mesh bag,\u201d says Tucker, with relief. \u201cIt used to be so rigid,\u201d says Brownstein. \u201cThe queering of the culture and the deconstruction of gender identity has freed up a lot of things for women.\u201d She thinks her queerness challenges the idea that middle age is a sexual wasteland.</p> <p>It\u2019s all in the album\u2019s best lyric: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more frightening and nothing more obscene than a well-worn body demanding to be seen,\u201d Brownstein yelps on the euphoric Love, a love letter written by Sleater-Kinney to themselves, and to resistance through collaboration. It sounds a bit different now that Weiss has left \u2013 rallying cry turned eulogy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just don\u2019t have that relationship to what we do where I think, if we do the same thing, people will love us</p> <footer> <cite>Carrie Brownstein</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Weiss quit, it added to a wave of growing scepticism among the band\u2019s hardcore fans who, it turned out, don\u2019t really want Sleater-Kinney to change. They criticised the band\u2019s new singles, saying that Clark\u2019s production made them sound too much like St Vincent. They criticised Brownstein for having her bum out, concluding that she and Clark (who she once dated) must be trying to dominate the band. They accused the band of selling out for leaving indie label Sub Pop for indie label Mom + Pop. Weiss leaving was taken as proof of all this. In the comments beneath her departing statement, people called Clark \u201cYoko Ono\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s been strange to watch \u2013 indicative of a pretty limited imagination about female collaboration and ambition. Perhaps you can understand why fans would want a reliable constant during a period of political chaos that has shown, as Brownstein has said, that progress is not inevitable. And when someone leaves a totemic feminist band \u2013 ideally a crucible of shared politics \u2013 people inevitably question how they can believe in their mission if one of their members apparently didn\u2019t. Scarier, perhaps, is the senseless way that old friendships can just end.</p> <p>But the criticism was misplaced. It had, in fact, been Weiss\u2019s idea to work with Clark, who says she felt no fear about pushing Sleater-Kinney even though she was once a teenage worshipper of the band, whose posters were on her bedroom wall. After their 2006 farewell gig in New York, Clark was \u201cso amped up that I kicked over a newsstand in excitement\u201d. \u201cNow,\u201d she thinks, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of ways to move people\u2019s hearts and make them wanna kick things over and scream.\u201d</p> <p>The group abandoned their original plan to work with multiple producers after their trial week with Clark in Los Angeles really took off. After that, Weiss didn\u2019t return until the last two days of recording. She was busy, Brownstein laments in Portland. (Weiss works as a film and TV location manager, a career that started on Brownstein\u2019s <em>Portlandia</em>.) There is a personal cost of being in a band, especially when each member has a very different economic reality: Brownstein a celebrity, Tucker a working mum, Weiss developing a new career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BsYSqYZh0ub/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

If it\u2019s not there equally, it can be really hard.\u201d</p> <p>As for fans\u2019 scepticism, this wasn\u2019t new. In 1997, Sleater-Kinney were accused of selling out when they left tiny queercore label Chainsaw for almost-as-tiny Kill Rock Stars. \u201cFrom the beginning, people have knocked our ideas of ambition,\u201d says Tucker. The point of changing label, producer and sound was change itself. \u201cI just don\u2019t have that relationship to what we do where I think, if we do the same thing, people will love us,\u201d says Brownstein. \u201cThen you\u2019re making work by consensus, which is the worst way to make art. It lacks a point of view.\u201d She\u2019s steadfast: \u201cCorin and I feel very confident that whatever we\u2019re doing in Sleater-Kinney is Sleater-Kinney.\u201d</p> <p>Weiss\u2019s departure will affect how people hear <em>The Center Won\u2019t Hold</em>. But practically speaking, Tucker and Brownstein write the songs. In our bleak postmortem interview, Brownstein shows a flash of optimism. \u201cCorin and I started this band and we\u2019ll end it. It was a long and really special journey with Janet, but there\u2019s also something about it being Corin and I that feels familiar and very normal.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker lights up. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d</p> <p>Brownstein laughs. \u201cThanks for letting me know.\u201d</p> <p>They say the split isn\u2019t acrimonious \u2013 just bad timing from someone famed for good timing. \u201cWe want Janet to be happy and healthy,\u201d says Tucker. \u201cIf someone\u2019s not happy doing that job, it wouldn\u2019t be good for any of us.\u201d And so this summer, Sleater-Kinney will be back searching for a drummer to help them smash through new ground: just the same but brand new.</p> <p><em>The Center Won\u2019t Hold is released by Mom + Pop on 16 August. The band play London, Manchester and Glasgow in February 2020</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "By now, we know reunion culture is a con. The brief excitement of seeing a favourite band re-form is swiftly tempered by watching them resentfully trot out the hits and confront their mortality. Plus, the past is no longer a novelty but our perpetual groundhog day of recycled franchises and rebooted brands. Which is why Sleater-Kinney\u2019s surprise return, in 2015, nine years after they went on hiatus, was so refreshing. Not content to rehash old glories, the feminist punks had a brilliant new album, the riotous, new wavy No Cities to Love, and singer-guitarists Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker and drummer Janet Weiss were unabashedly vocal about ending the dearth of fortysomething women in rock. Even better, it turned out not to be a one-off. This January, news that St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, had produced their new album \u201cbroke the internet\u201d, said US indie bible Pitchfork, sounding slightly awed by the \u201cendless possibilities of what this collaboration might sound like\u201d. \u201cEndless possibilities\u201d was on the money: The Center Won\u2019t Hold is Sleater-Kinney\u2019s most diverse album, bursting with vaudevillian romps about how women are naturals at handling chaos, industrial demands for carnal and spiritual satisfaction, Tom Petty-indebted balladry couching admissions of betrayal and rousing choruses made to yell at last orders. In mid-June, I am due to meet the trio to discuss their second second coming over lunch in Portland, Oregon, but I get an email hours beforehand saying Weiss is ill. Tucker arrives at the neighbourhood spot first, her striped earrings matching her monochrome T-shirt. It\u2019s a shame about Weiss, I say. \u201cYeah,\u201d Tucker says with a sigh, looking at the sky. \u201cIt is.\u201d Brownstein appears, tiny and shaggily glam in a grey felted jacket. We head into the restaurant, which is straight out of Portlandia, the now concluded Emmy-winning satire of life in the zealously artisanal city that Brownstein wrote and starred in. She orders fish stew, while Tucker orders cornbread and asks the waiter what their \u201czero food print\u201d certification means. It\u2019s a programme funding climate-friendly farming, we learn, as Michael Jackson plays over the stereo. They laugh at the ethical absurdity. Tucker and Brownstein are Sleater-Kinney\u2019s songwriters and their 25-year friendship is seductive. They\u2019re as goofy as they are deferential, less serious than you might imagine \u2013 Brownstein\u2019s grin occupies half her face and Tucker frequently detonates an explosive laugh. This new album is a bit of a fluke, they explain. Last spring, Brownstein was developing an adaptation of her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl for TV, a potential post-Portlandia project. The lightly fictionalised show would trace her and Tucker\u2019s search for a drummer in Olympia, Washington, where they met as students who moved to the city to join the early 90s riot grrrl scene. Back then, in real life, the pair flew to Melbourne to meet their first drummer without hearing a beat of her playing. They made two albums with Laura Macfarlane, until the geographical logistics became annoying. Then they found Weiss, who was \u201cthe best decision we ever made\u201d, Brownstein wrote in her memoir. Weiss joined for their third (and first great) album, 1997\u2019s poppy, punchy Dig Me Out. They eclipsed the DIY Olympia scene and became one of America\u2019s most innovative rock bands, subverting girl-group convention and classic rock excess, while Tucker\u2019s astonishing gospel wail gave their work a powerful spiritual urgency. Once fans found out that Tucker and Brownstein had briefly dated, they became queer icons of a sort, too. Brownstein\u2019s pilot for the show about their early days wasn\u2019t picked up. But if it had succeeded, she says, who knows when they would have had time to make a new album. \u201cI was like, why am I examining music through a historical lens? My relationship to music is right now. That\u2019s more important to me.\u201d That relationship was reinvigorated when they saw young people who missed them first time at their incendiary reunion shows. I went to five of those to make up for lost time; aged 16, I\u2019d bought their single Jumpers on sight. It was on green vinyl and the credits billed three women, which was enough of a USP in the laddy 00s. I was too late \u2013 it turned out to be their last single. Brownstein recently started to think the bar around their 2015 comeback was too low. \u201cThere\u2019s this leeway: oh, it\u2019s not terrible! And it was nothing even close to terrible, but you can sail on the momentum of relieved enthusiasm for a while.\u201d Deciding to continue raises the stakes: the only point, says Tucker, is to do something different. \u201cWanting to play with what we\u2019ve done before, wanting to take risks.\u201d Taking risks can prove, well, risky. Nine days after I meet Tucker and Brownstein, Weiss quits Sleater-Kinney. \u201cThe band is heading in a new direction and it is time for me to move on,\u201d she says in a statement. I track her down and ask if she wants to talk; she considers it, but declines. Tucker and Brownstein sound crushed when we speak the day after Weiss\u2019s news. They admit that she wasn\u2019t unwell the day we met in Portland \u2013 this happened very recently and suddenly and they didn\u2019t know what was going on. They tried band therapy. They won\u2019t speculate on Weiss\u2019s reasoning, although Brownstein says they thought \u201ceveryone was really happy about the record\u201d. But the show will go on. Brownstein says they are as determined to evolve as ever. \u201cAfter these years, it might feel harder to take those risks, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m invested in. Corin and I took ourselves to the opposite side of the world to start Sleater-Kinney. There\u2019s always been something impulsive and scrappy about this band and I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s another way to be in it except to adapt and evolve.\u201d Appropriately, The Center Won\u2019t Hold takes inspiration from an unlikely source \u2013 at least for a punk band. They were driving around listening to Rihanna\u2019s ballad Stay when Brownstein said she wanted to write a song like it. When they started writing in earnest, she was living in Los Angeles, Tucker in Portland (Brownstein later moved back), so they had to work remotely for the first time, giving them space to expand their individual visions. Tucker\u2019s songs are bleaker than Brownstein\u2019s, full of searching and isolation: \u201cDarkness winning again,\u201d she sings on the stormy Reach Out. She was depressed. Tucker had worked for her dad for years, in marketing and web design. When his company was bought by a big corporation, she was let go. \u201cMy brain went: argh, too much,\u201d she says. She sought medication, which helped. She laughs: \u201cIt also gave me the freedom to be like: you\u2019re 100% supposed to be being an artist right now.\u201d Brownstein apologetically ventures a \u201csuper-psychoanalytical\u201d theory. Tucker became a parent before Sleater-Kinney made 2002\u2019s One Beat, one of the period\u2019s few explicitly anti-Bush albums \u2013 Far Away depicted her breastfeeding while watching televised warfare. \u201cRemember your awareness of being a mother and having to be protective of your kids?\u201d Brownstein asks. \u201cYour son is 18, he\u2019s going to college. Not like, \u2018You\u2019re done!\u2019, but it seems like you feel so much more freedom to express anxieties. That\u2019s maybe harder when you\u2019re holding so tight to notions of family.\u201d Tucker agrees. She had worried that being a musician would mess up her kids \u2013 her second was born after the band\u2019s 2006 break \u2013 but with one kid out the door, she feels relief. \u201cIt is really freeing to rage a bit more in my songs.\u201d Not that she\u2019s been sanguine in the interim \u2013 she raged loudly on the last album. Also, what about her 11-year-old daughter? \u201cShe\u2019s raising herself,\u201d Brownstein deadpans. Their relationships have registered the change. Now 46, Tucker says she used to be the care-giver while Brownstein, 44, was needier. (Brownstein describes Weiss, 53, as consistently \u201cno-nonsense\u201d.) \u201cCarrie has really worked on being a very nurturing person,\u201d says Tucker, with comedy largesse. \u201cShe\u2019s very caring.\u201d \u201cSpeak louder!\u201d Brownstein demands, laughing. Tucker says she has become less nice, although she still insists on sharing her lunch. \u201cI\u2019ve raised two kids, done that, and now I\u2019m more in touch with what I need, what I deserve.\u201d That need rages through Broken, the bluesy piano ballad that took the Rihanna inspiration somewhere very different. It\u2019s a tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her in 1982. \u201cShe stood up for us when she testified me, me too,\u201d Tucker sings, ruefully: \u201cMy body cried out when she spoke those lines.\u201d Kavanaugh was appointed anyway. But one outcome, says Tucker, was positive. \u201cTo say \u2018me too\u2019 means this matters, that you have ownership over what happened to you. It\u2019s OK to say it impacted your life at any age. Men lost their jobs. That\u2019s a big deal. Harvey Weinstein walking to court in handcuffs \u2013 that\u2019s a win.\u201d Still: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough and the legal part is mind-numbingly slow to change.\u201d Meanwhile, the backlash is swift. \u201cStraight, white men are in a state of disinheritance from positions of power that they assumed were their inalienable right,\u201d says Brownstein, who gets academic when drawn on intellectual topics. \u201cWhen you have so many people fearful of losing power, what they do to keep it is the brutality we\u2019re living in. Take anti-abortion legislation \u2013 there\u2019s such pushback when there is progress. It is not inevitable.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThose reminders are very desolate.\u201d But Broken aside, The Center Won\u2019t Hold isn\u2019t explicitly political. \u201cIf people thought Sleater-Kinney was gonna put out some loud, anti-Trump record, they would be misguided,\u201d says Brownstein. The restaurant has closed, so we perch outside. Sleater-Kinney have already written those songs, she laughs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been addressing the #MeToo movement and shitty patriarchal systems of injustice and subjugation since 1995!\u201d If anything, Trump\u2019s presidency has forced a reconsideration of what makes art \u201cpolitical\u201d. Performing rage was the preserve of punk. Now it\u2019s mainstream discourse. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to want to match that level of hyperbole,\u201d says Brownstein. \u201cEven though I appreciate the spirit of anger, that volume has been claimed by some really terrible people.\u201d Made by four women, the album is inherently \u201cits own political statement\u201d, she says. Tucker brings up Hillary Clinton: \u201cThis squashing of older women is such a part of our patriarchal culture, but it got turned up. We thought, let\u2019s not mellow out at all, let\u2019s take our music and see how much we can expand it, change it.\u201d Hang on \u2013 from singing about rape culture in 1995 to the violence of capitalism on No Cities to Love, Sleater-Kinney have never been mellow. Brownstein half-agrees: \u201cThat was the whole creed we came out of \u2013 90s punk-rock feminism \u2013 but the older you get, the scarier it is to actually say you still want to be doing this because there are fewer stories in popular music by women of a certain age. Doing that when we were younger was almost taken for granted. Now you actually have to grab for it, be a little bit greedy and voracious.\u201d Expansive and adventurous, The Center Won\u2019t Hold makes that statement boldly. There\u2019s also the matter of Brownstein\u2019s bare bum being on the cover of single Hurry on Home. She had wanted the whole band to be naked. \u201cThat was a bad idea!\u201d Brownstein admits. Tucker \u2013 and her daughter \u2013 agreed. \u201cI was reading her texts aloud and she was like, \u2018MOM! You\u2019re not DOING THAT!\u2019\u201d They cackle. They say they were too shy to celebrate their sexuality in their 20s. Brownstein claims someone once wrote an angry dissertation about a photo where her pants were visible. Plus, says Tucker, \u201cmusic has always been the playground of men\u2019s sexuality. Women have really struggled to claim their own space.\u201d (That\u2019s also why they think #MeToo has barely touched the music industry.) Sexual empowerment is in a state of hyper-evolution: now it would be the writer decrying Brownstein\u2019s knickers who would be considered a traitor. \u201cGender as a construct is now like a mesh bag,\u201d says Tucker, with relief. \u201cIt used to be so rigid,\u201d says Brownstein. \u201cThe queering of the culture and the deconstruction of gender identity has freed up a lot of things for women.\u201d She thinks her queerness challenges the idea that middle age is a sexual wasteland. It\u2019s all in the album\u2019s best lyric: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more frightening and nothing more obscene than a well-worn body demanding to be seen,\u201d Brownstein yelps on the euphoric Love, a love letter written by Sleater-Kinney to themselves, and to resistance through collaboration. It sounds a bit different now that Weiss has left \u2013 rallying cry turned eulogy. When Weiss quit, it added to a wave of growing scepticism among the band\u2019s hardcore fans who, it turned out, don\u2019t really want Sleater-Kinney to change. They criticised the band\u2019s new singles, saying that Clark\u2019s production made them sound too much like St Vincent. They criticised Brownstein for having her bum out, concluding that she and Clark (who she once dated) must be trying to dominate the band. They accused the band of selling out for leaving indie label Sub Pop for indie label Mom + Pop. Weiss leaving was taken as proof of all this. In the comments beneath her departing statement, people called Clark \u201cYoko Ono\u201d. It\u2019s been strange to watch \u2013 indicative of a pretty limited imagination about female collaboration and ambition. Perhaps you can understand why fans would want a reliable constant during a period of political chaos that has shown, as Brownstein has said, that progress is not inevitable. And when someone leaves a totemic feminist band \u2013 ideally a crucible of shared politics \u2013 people inevitably question how they can believe in their mission if one of their members apparently didn\u2019t. Scarier, perhaps, is the senseless way that old friendships can just end. But the criticism was misplaced. It had, in fact, been Weiss\u2019s idea to work with Clark, who says she felt no fear about pushing Sleater-Kinney even though she was once a teenage worshipper of the band, whose posters were on her bedroom wall. After their 2006 farewell gig in New York, Clark was \u201cso amped up that I kicked over a newsstand in excitement\u201d. \u201cNow,\u201d she thinks, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of ways to move people\u2019s hearts and make them wanna kick things over and scream.\u201d The group abandoned their original plan to work with multiple producers after their trial week with Clark in Los Angeles really took off. After that, Weiss didn\u2019t return until the last two days of recording. She was busy, Brownstein laments in Portland. (Weiss works as a film and TV location manager, a career that started on Brownstein\u2019s Portlandia.) There is a personal cost of being in a band, especially when each member has a very different economic reality: Brownstein a celebrity, Tucker a working mum, Weiss developing a new career. Those disparities inevitably affect what Sleater-Kinney means to everybody. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky when it\u2019s not the life raft you\u2019re all on,\u201d Brownstein says, sadly. \u201cNot that the band needs to be a life raft the same way it might have in 1997, but it requires an urgency mixed with joy and appreciation from each of us. If it\u2019s not there equally, it can be really hard.\u201d As for fans\u2019 scepticism, this wasn\u2019t new. In 1997, Sleater-Kinney were accused of selling out when they left tiny queercore label Chainsaw for almost-as-tiny Kill Rock Stars. \u201cFrom the beginning, people have knocked our ideas of ambition,\u201d says Tucker. The point of changing label, producer and sound was change itself. \u201cI just don\u2019t have that relationship to what we do where I think, if we do the same thing, people will love us,\u201d says Brownstein. \u201cThen you\u2019re making work by consensus, which is the worst way to make art. It lacks a point of view.\u201d She\u2019s steadfast: \u201cCorin and I feel very confident that whatever we\u2019re doing in Sleater-Kinney is Sleater-Kinney.\u201d Weiss\u2019s departure will affect how people hear The Center Won\u2019t Hold. But practically speaking, Tucker and Brownstein write the songs. In our bleak postmortem interview, Brownstein shows a flash of optimism. \u201cCorin and I started this band and we\u2019ll end it. It was a long and really special journey with Janet, but there\u2019s also something about it being Corin and I that feels familiar and very normal.\u201d Tucker lights up. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d Brownstein laughs. \u201cThanks for letting me know.\u201d They say the split isn\u2019t acrimonious \u2013 just bad timing from someone famed for good timing. \u201cWe want Janet to be happy and healthy,\u201d says Tucker. \u201cIf someone\u2019s not happy doing that job, it wouldn\u2019t be good for any of us.\u201d And so this summer, Sleater-Kinney will be back searching for a drummer to help them smash through new ground: just the same but brand new. The Center Won\u2019t Hold is released by Mom + Pop on 16 August. The band play London, Manchester and Glasgow in February 2020",

I need a holiday so badly, my many rashes present as tan. At work I pick up the phone and forget my name. I yawn at gale force three.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I couldn\u2019t work out how to click the box saying \u2018I\u2019m not a robot\u2019 yesterday, then wondered if maybe I\u2019d become one. My humanness is debatable. I\u2019m so tired that the air around my fingertips is thick soup, and when I move my hands it\u2019s like I\u2019m swimming, badly.\u201d \u201cHmm, yeah, I have that, but not soup, gel-like, toothpaste, like, my limbs are coated with something that hardens and cracks as I walk. I\u2019m so tired it, feels like I\u2019m wearing magnetic eyelashes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more tired than that. I\u2019m so tired that when I try and talk a sound comes out like a 90s modem, just a load of jelly and static, and I have to swallow a number of times to restart my throat and allow the words to come.\u201d \u201cOh, you try and talk? Wow, good for you. I\u2019m far too tired to talk. Instead, if I need to communicate, I perform a gentle beast-like mime, or whisper it into a nearby piece of technology.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so tired I misread headlines to comic effect, but don\u2019t have the energy to tell anybody about my witty mistake, thereby wasting one of the few true opportunities to connect with my family. I\u2019m so tired that all I can eat are moistened biscuits, with very pale tea.\u201d \u201cEat? I haven\u2019t eaten properly in days. Too tired. Just sandwich spread and crusts. I have a flannel beside my chair that I dip in Ribena, and ask passing strangers to wring into my mouth. I\u2019m so tired that my tongue is confused enough to allow each of these drips to taste like a full meal \u2013 tomato salad, ketchup, cherry pie, anything as long as it\u2019s red. The colour of stress.\u201d \u201cAt 4am I scroll through the last-minute holiday offers, and zoom in on the sunlit joy on young men\u2019s faces, and yearn for a release from this island of fatigue.\u201d \u201cI do the same, and I am tireder than you. My work is both stressful and physical, and requires emotional violence just to get to five o\u2019clock. My family ditto.\u201d \u201cI read novels in order to sleep, but instead they fill me with dystopian dreads, and I am plunged into new baths of wakefulness.\u201d \u201cEvery hour I look at the clock, and try and trick myself to sleep, but I am cleverer than me, so it\u2019s yet to work.\u201d \u201cMy body\u2019s so tired that it\u2019s forgotten how to sleep, and I lie in bed composing long emails to supermarkets about plastic waste.\u201d \u201cIn the morning I find poetry on my phone, quite beautiful compositions, occasionally in Tagalog. I have a constant hangover, despite having given up drinking alcohol \u2013 instead it feels like I\u2019ve drunk too many strangers\u2019 problems.\u201d \u201cI try, I try. My sleep hygiene is so good that you could eat your dinner off it. I plug my phone in downstairs, and retreat to a room so minimal it looks like heaven in a 60s film.\u201d \u201cMy sheets are hotel-quality \u2013 a good hotel, none of your rubbish \u2013 so fine, so expensive, that to lie down on them is to feel like you\u2019re floating through someone else\u2019s dream. Feather pillows, baked fresh. And still, I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m the most tired.\u201d \u201cYou think? I\u2019m so tired my nighttime routine plays tricks on me.\u201d \u201cI have developed an allergy to my silk pillowcase, the smell of lavender now speaks only of toilets. I play white noise from 9pm, but am so tired that I hear music in it, music that calls me, that beckons me, that summons me up to reorganise my spice shelf alphabetically.\u201d \u201cI need a holiday so badly that today I broke down and wept openly at the sound of seagulls. I\u2019m so tired that my brain rattles around in my skull like a lost button.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too tired for similes. I\u2019m so tired that my hair is glass, my skin is sand, my muscles are cheese strings, my tongue is a pastie.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so tired my body only exists as a vessel to carry around my exhaustion. Which is heavier than me.\u201d \u201cI need a holiday, when I will wipe these ghosts off me like cobwebs, and remove this cardigan of despair, and unclasp underwear that contains a winter\u2019s worth of bad decisions, and I will lie in dappled sunlight and finally sleep.\u201d \u201cWith jet lag? No chance.\u201d Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman",

      "body": "<p>Comedy is such a simple thing. One person tells a joke. Another person laughs. The end. Simple.</p> <p>Except, as every comedian knows, simple doesn\u2019t mean easy. Not only do you have to make someone laugh (which is hard), if you\u2019re a comedian, you have to make them laugh in the right way. At the right thing. For the right reason. We can all make a gag about Trump\u2019s hairdo, but that won\u2019t get us very far.</p> <p>And because of this, comics are constantly asking themselves questions. What\u2019s the truth I\u2019m telling? What is the power I\u2019m tilting at? Who or what am I mocking? And, more recently: who is going to take offence?</p> <p>On 11 June, the long-established comedian Jo Brand made a one-liner on a Radio 4 programme, <em>Heresy</em>. She cracked a slightly slack gag about the recent trend of throwing milkshakes over rightwing politicians. Brand said: \u201cWhy bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?\u201d The audience laughed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab936a3145a6494a30001aa1e00c951c63ccdcbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab936a3145a6494a30001aa1e00c951c63ccdcbc/0_0_942_1200/785.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Brand's joke on the front page of the Sun\" width=\"785\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sun decries Jo Brand\u2019s joke on its front page.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No Credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nigel Farage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/12/farage-furious-over-jo-brands-throw-battery-acid-not-milkshake-joke\" title=\"\">took offence</a> (which is odd, because he does like a chuckle). He called Brand\u2019s joke \u201can incitement to violence\u201d and demanded that the police investigate. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/13/police-investigate-jo-brands-battery-acid-remark\" title=\"\">did so</a>, and decided, legally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/14/police-to-take-no-action-against-jo-brand-over-battery-acid-comments\" title=\"\">it wasn\u2019t</a>. In fact, it was a joke. But, after two days of media furore, Brand apologised.</p> <p>Jokes are under scrutiny. Though the fundamentals of comedy haven\u2019t altered \u2013 comedians are employed to make people laugh \u2013 where those jokes go is changing. No longer does a gag stay in the room where it was told. If it\u2019s filmed on a phone and put online, it spreads to an audience for which it was never intended. If it\u2019s repeated on social media \u2013 clipped short, removed from the atmosphere around it, ripped from the buildup created by the comedian and sent out to people who don\u2019t even want to hear it \u2013 then it travels further; but also something is different. The words are the same, but it\u2019s not the same joke.</p> <p>To be clear \u2013 it\u2019s important to be clear \u2013 this article is not a \u201cwhither free speech\u201d article. It\u2019s not a piece<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>asks: \u201cWhat can comedians make jokes about these days?\u201d Because the answer is, of course, anything they like. If you\u2019re a comedian, that\u2019s your job (and your moral compass). But is it possible to be a comedian when you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re making jokes for? When you\u2019re unsure who\u2019s listening and what kind of mood they\u2019re in? How can comedians tell the jokes they want in a world where the butt of those jokes \u2013 from powerful politicians to powerless constituents \u2013 don\u2019t just get upset but turn a community against you or threaten legal action? Can comedy survive in this age of outrage?</p> <p>I call up comedians: Daliso Chaponda, the Malawian comic; American satirist Jena Friedman; Tiff Stevenson, the English standup; <em>Wacky Racists</em> comedy club host Sophie Duker; and Josie Long, who are all taking one-person shows to Edinburgh. I also talk to Geoff Norcott, Katy Brand and Brian Logan, the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s comedy critic. Frankie Boyle, outrage-iste extraordinaire, links me to his recent <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/frankie_boyle/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> post about free speech; Stewart Lee writes me a long email. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aee3fe4718c5735da5b629de7ed8e897321f1452\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aee3fe4718c5735da5b629de7ed8e897321f1452/0_0_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There\u2019s a bond of trust\u2019: Katy Brand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a bond of trust\u2019: Katy Brand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karla Gowlett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone I speak to insists that there is a difference between being in the room when a joke is told and receiving a truncated gag a few days later. \u201cThe more distant you are from the origin of a joke, the less funny it is,\u201d says Katy Brand, who has written a book about <em>Dirty Dancing</em>, out in October. \u201cThe joke goes out in rings, like a pebble in water, out and out and out, until it\u2019s a headline and people read it and get offended. The bigger the potential audience, the higher the risk of offence.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the size of the audience, though; it\u2019s whether that audience wants to hear the joke. When standups perform live, the people in the room really want to be there. They\u2019ve paid to be in on the joke, to be part of that particular comedy moment. In the past, Lee has called audiences \u201ccomplicit\u201d: involved as soon as a comedian says something and they laugh. Brand points out that at a comedy gig two contracts are operating. One is between the comedian and the venue. This one\u2019s a literal contract that hires the comedian to try and make people laugh for a specified amount of time, for a specified amount of money. And then there\u2019s another, virtual, contract, between the comedian and the audience. It says: \u201cThis is a space where we are going to have fun.\u201d This contract is a licence to play.</p> <p>\u201cSo you can enjoy yourself,\u201d says Brand. \u201cThere\u2019s a bond of trust and you\u2019re naturally freer. You\u2019re cut some slack about what you\u2019re doing, because the audience understand your intent.\u201d</p> <p>In that room, there\u2019s an acknowledgement that jokes take time to develop. To get an Edinburgh show, comedians need to hone their act in front of a live audience. Lee writes: \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would have developed some of the initially unwieldy and apparently tasteless ideas I have had over the years, that went on to become beloved bits, under the scrutiny of the online era. Things that you have maybe only done once in a little club, and which could still be ill formed and thoughtlessly worded in their infant state.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b12e768b58b0c6a0caed4cd88cd94503a031a6db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b12e768b58b0c6a0caed4cd88cd94503a031a6db/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Onstage is a protected space\u2019: comedian Josie Long.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Onstage is a protected space\u2019: comedian Josie Long.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bebber/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the comedian\u2019s best, most solid defence to a joke being misinterpreted is this: you had to be there. You had to be in the room. \u201cNinety per cent of people would probably laugh if they were in the room,\u201d says Katy Brand. \u201cOnstage is a protected space,\u201d says Josie Long, who is changing her subject matter at Edinburgh from politics to parenthood. Logan agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s a fluidity of communication on a comedy stage,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of a joke might be gestural, or playing a game with truth and fiction.\u201d</p> <p>But that defence doesn\u2019t always work. After all, Jo Brand felt duty-bound to apologise, despite doing what she was paid for. And \u201cI was only joking, you had to be there\u201d is the refuge of scoundrels, surely? Isn\u2019t that what Ukip candidate Carl Benjamin said recently about a 2016 video <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/07/police-investigating-ukip-candidate-youtube-carl-benjamin-jess-phillips-comments\" title=\"\">remark he made</a> about Jess Phillips: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even rape you\u201d?</p> <p>\u201cThe difference is, he\u2019s a politician, and she\u2019s a comedian,\u201d says Tiff Stevenson. <em>Britain\u2019s Got Talent</em> veteran Chaponda makes this point, too. If you\u2019re in a job where your words are supposed to be taken seriously (a politician), then you should expect people to do just that. If you\u2019re in a job where your words are supposed to be taken unseriously (a comedian), then, surely, you should expect people to understand that too. \u201cIn comedy, you say things you don\u2019t necessarily mean,\u201d says Chaponda, a sentiment echoed by Katy Brand: \u201cWhen someone says something as a joke, this doesn\u2019t mean it actually happened.\u201d It\u2019s that contract, again. If you pay for comedy, then you expect to hear jokes. Sometimes it can seem like people don\u2019t know what jokes are. Jokes aren\u2019t journalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f8c2dbf9cd6b6df5879f8b9d10258efd429d7a51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8c2dbf9cd6b6df5879f8b9d10258efd429d7a51/0_34_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daliso Chaponda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In comedy, you say things you don\u2019t necessarily mean\u2019: Daliso Chaponda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Expectations are part of this, of course, and even within comedy there are different expectations as to what you\u2019re going to be laughing at. If you book tickets to see Michael McIntyre and take your 12-year-old child, you would be justified in being shocked if McIntyre came on stage and did a Chris Rock set. If you listen to Radio 4, you\u2019d be right to take offence if Miles Jupp started swearing. But, other than that, strap yourself in. Comedians push your buttons. That\u2019s what they do.</p> <p>Geoff Norcott, who had a documentary on BBC Two last week about the middle classes, is billed as a rightwing comedian because he voted for Brexit and got a lot of stick when he went on <em>Mock the Week</em>. \u201cI fired a few shots at remainers and they were upset. Because <em>Mock the Week</em> has an established leftwing audience, so it shook them up a bit. But with <em>The Mash Report</em> I don\u2019t, because I was set up as who I am from the start.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie Duker thinks about audience expectations all the time. She\u2019s not so well known, so audiences can\u2019t predict where her comedy might go. \u201cThe way people receive me in different settings is so different,\u201d she says. \u201cSuper young, super cosmopolitan people, or older dudes in the sticks \u2013 I want both sets of people to like me and have a good time.\u201d</p> <p>Intent matters too. If a comedian says something outrageous, they may well be intending to make a point. Intent means that the best comedians can use offence as part of a complicated journey \u2013 via jokes \u2013 to get to an underlying truth. (If you\u2019re outraged, maybe you should wonder why.) Boyle, in his Instagram post, points out that jokes, in their simplest form, rely on outrage. There\u2019s a set-up and then, pow! The punchline is extreme, not ordinary. A joke is meant to shake you up. Jokes rely a lot on fear, and you laugh because you\u2019re a little bit scared of your reaction. Comedians know and love this. \u201cIf there\u2019s a joke where someone might be offended, I have to do it in front of them,\u201d says Duker. \u201cNot to offend them, but because I need to know that the material can work, even when I\u2019m scared of doing it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d406b22f3d3fb4f55a06ab2982fc4ecb7421ab66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d406b22f3d3fb4f55a06ab2982fc4ecb7421ab66/411_0_2177_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Duker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Duker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of all this, comedians are constantly listening to their audience. Which bit worked better? Why didn\u2019t that joke land? Are they laughing because they got the irony, or because they like the bigotry? Standups accept that they don\u2019t always get things right. Every comedian I speak to mentions that they have cut or rewritten jokes. Chaponda took out a gag that relied on a punchline about domestic violence. When Friedman released the DVD of her show <em>American C*nt</em>, she removed a gag about Caitlyn Jenner. \u201cEven if she\u2019s an OK target, now I\u2019ve met more trans people I don\u2019t want to attack this vulnerable population,\u201d she says. Josie Long used the word psychopathic, and was challenged, \u201cand I thought, I don\u2019t need to cling on to this\u201d. Often, comedians change jokes because of a conversation with an audience member who had experienced what they were joking about. Is the joke worth the hurt it\u2019s causing?</p> <p>Other times, though, comedians double down on their gags. Katy Brand had a routine about Christianity and she felt \u201cutterly confident\u201d in defending it because she was herself a teenage Christian, plus she had a theology degree. Stevenson put up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tiffstevenson/status/1145182821717164032\" title=\"\">a gag on Twitter</a> about the difference between how depression is viewed in men and women. When some men objected, she pointed to examples like Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, but also to her own experience.</p> <p>When comedians assess jokes, cast aside quips, try out and test new gags, they\u2019re aware of the audience. But they also know that much of the joy of comedy is to be found along the fault lines of offence and etiquette. Where comedy functions is in those areas that need to be explored, where society is trying to work out what it thinks. The shifting of what society finds acceptable and what it doesn\u2019t is precisely where comedians operate. And being offended, of course, is a choice.</p> <p>So what do audiences find offensive? It depends on who\u2019s telling the joke. If you\u2019re a comedian with an established following, you can probably guess at your audience\u2019s sensibilities. With Jimmy Carr, for instance, everything appears to be a target. (But even he doesn\u2019t tell race jokes.) Long\u2019s audience has a different sensibility. Sometimes, though, people get upset in ways you can\u2019t predict. When Norcott appeared on <em>Live at the Apollo</em>, he says: \u201cI made jokes about Tories, concentration camps. But the bit that got everyone upset was when I said my wife likes shoes. But she does!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d11b6e67f2ad3c6a5d72660739b0efa42c552aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d11b6e67f2ad3c6a5d72660739b0efa42c552aa/0_173_5197_3119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiff Stevenson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had to reassure the audience \u2026 I could feel their panic\u2019: Tiff Stevenson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carla Speight/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes audiences get upset on behalf of others. Chaponda was attacked for saying he wasn\u2019t offended by Alan Sugar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/lord-sugar-under-fire-over-racist-senegal-world-cup-team-tweet\" title=\"\">comparing the Senegal national football team to Marbella beach sellers</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s paternalistic,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that all black people should feel the same. That\u2019s ignorant.\u201d</p> <p>He also takes issue with the idea that being offended is a bad thing. \u201cSome people have said that being offended is like being punched in the face,\u201d he says. \u201cI went to see <em>Book of Mormon</em>, and I loved a lot of it, but I was offended by some of the jokes about Africa and religion, because I\u2019m very religious. That offence was interesting, it made me look at my own prejudices. But it wasn\u2019t like being punched in the face.\u201d</p> <p>Not many people are as reasonable as Chaponda.

      "bodyText": "Comedy is such a simple thing. One person tells a joke. Another person laughs. The end. Simple. Except, as every comedian knows, simple doesn\u2019t mean easy. Not only do you have to make someone laugh (which is hard), if you\u2019re a comedian, you have to make them laugh in the right way. At the right thing. For the right reason. We can all make a gag about Trump\u2019s hairdo, but that won\u2019t get us very far. And because of this, comics are constantly asking themselves questions. What\u2019s the truth I\u2019m telling? What is the power I\u2019m tilting at? Who or what am I mocking? And, more recently: who is going to take offence? On 11 June, the long-established comedian Jo Brand made a one-liner on a Radio 4 programme, Heresy. She cracked a slightly slack gag about the recent trend of throwing milkshakes over rightwing politicians. Brand said: \u201cWhy bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?\u201d The audience laughed. Nigel Farage took offence (which is odd, because he does like a chuckle). He called Brand\u2019s joke \u201can incitement to violence\u201d and demanded that the police investigate. They did so, and decided, legally, it wasn\u2019t. In fact, it was a joke. But, after two days of media furore, Brand apologised. Jokes are under scrutiny. Though the fundamentals of comedy haven\u2019t altered \u2013 comedians are employed to make people laugh \u2013 where those jokes go is changing. No longer does a gag stay in the room where it was told. If it\u2019s filmed on a phone and put online, it spreads to an audience for which it was never intended. If it\u2019s repeated on social media \u2013 clipped short, removed from the atmosphere around it, ripped from the buildup created by the comedian and sent out to people who don\u2019t even want to hear it \u2013 then it travels further; but also something is different. The words are the same, but it\u2019s not the same joke. To be clear \u2013 it\u2019s important to be clear \u2013 this article is not a \u201cwhither free speech\u201d article. It\u2019s not a piece that asks: \u201cWhat can comedians make jokes about these days?\u201d Because the answer is, of course, anything they like. If you\u2019re a comedian, that\u2019s your job (and your moral compass). But is it possible to be a comedian when you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re making jokes for? When you\u2019re unsure who\u2019s listening and what kind of mood they\u2019re in? How can comedians tell the jokes they want in a world where the butt of those jokes \u2013 from powerful politicians to powerless constituents \u2013 don\u2019t just get upset but turn a community against you or threaten legal action? Can comedy survive in this age of outrage? I call up comedians: Daliso Chaponda, the Malawian comic; American satirist Jena Friedman; Tiff Stevenson, the English standup; Wacky Racists comedy club host Sophie Duker; and Josie Long, who are all taking one-person shows to Edinburgh. I also talk to Geoff Norcott, Katy Brand and Brian Logan, the Guardian\u2019s comedy critic. Frankie Boyle, outrage-iste extraordinaire, links me to his recent Instagram post about free speech; Stewart Lee writes me a long email. Everyone I speak to insists that there is a difference between being in the room when a joke is told and receiving a truncated gag a few days later. \u201cThe more distant you are from the origin of a joke, the less funny it is,\u201d says Katy Brand, who has written a book about Dirty Dancing, out in October. \u201cThe joke goes out in rings, like a pebble in water, out and out and out, until it\u2019s a headline and people read it and get offended. The bigger the potential audience, the higher the risk of offence.\u201d It\u2019s not just the size of the audience, though; it\u2019s whether that audience wants to hear the joke. When standups perform live, the people in the room really want to be there. They\u2019ve paid to be in on the joke, to be part of that particular comedy moment. In the past, Lee has called audiences \u201ccomplicit\u201d: involved as soon as a comedian says something and they laugh. Brand points out that at a comedy gig two contracts are operating. One is between the comedian and the venue. This one\u2019s a literal contract that hires the comedian to try and make people laugh for a specified amount of time, for a specified amount of money. And then there\u2019s another, virtual, contract, between the comedian and the audience. It says: \u201cThis is a space where we are going to have fun.\u201d This contract is a licence to play. \u201cSo you can enjoy yourself,\u201d says Brand. \u201cThere\u2019s a bond of trust and you\u2019re naturally freer. You\u2019re cut some slack about what you\u2019re doing, because the audience understand your intent.\u201d In that room, there\u2019s an acknowledgement that jokes take time to develop. To get an Edinburgh show, comedians need to hone their act in front of a live audience. Lee writes: \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would have developed some of the initially unwieldy and apparently tasteless ideas I have had over the years, that went on to become beloved bits, under the scrutiny of the online era. Things that you have maybe only done once in a little club, and which could still be ill formed and thoughtlessly worded in their infant state.\u201d So the comedian\u2019s best, most solid defence to a joke being misinterpreted is this: you had to be there. You had to be in the room. \u201cNinety per cent of people would probably laugh if they were in the room,\u201d says Katy Brand. \u201cOnstage is a protected space,\u201d says Josie Long, who is changing her subject matter at Edinburgh from politics to parenthood. Logan agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s a fluidity of communication on a comedy stage,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of a joke might be gestural, or playing a game with truth and fiction.\u201d But that defence doesn\u2019t always work. After all, Jo Brand felt duty-bound to apologise, despite doing what she was paid for. And \u201cI was only joking, you had to be there\u201d is the refuge of scoundrels, surely? Isn\u2019t that what Ukip candidate Carl Benjamin said recently about a 2016 video remark he made about Jess Phillips: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even rape you\u201d? \u201cThe difference is, he\u2019s a politician, and she\u2019s a comedian,\u201d says Tiff Stevenson. Britain\u2019s Got Talent veteran Chaponda makes this point, too. If you\u2019re in a job where your words are supposed to be taken seriously (a politician), then you should expect people to do just that. If you\u2019re in a job where your words are supposed to be taken unseriously (a comedian), then, surely, you should expect people to understand that too. \u201cIn comedy, you say things you don\u2019t necessarily mean,\u201d says Chaponda, a sentiment echoed by Katy Brand: \u201cWhen someone says something as a joke, this doesn\u2019t mean it actually happened.\u201d It\u2019s that contract, again. If you pay for comedy, then you expect to hear jokes. Sometimes it can seem like people don\u2019t know what jokes are. Jokes aren\u2019t journalism. Expectations are part of this, of course, and even within comedy there are different expectations as to what you\u2019re going to be laughing at. If you book tickets to see Michael McIntyre and take your 12-year-old child, you would be justified in being shocked if McIntyre came on stage and did a Chris Rock set. If you listen to Radio 4, you\u2019d be right to take offence if Miles Jupp started swearing. But, other than that, strap yourself in. Comedians push your buttons. That\u2019s what they do. Geoff Norcott, who had a documentary on BBC Two last week about the middle classes, is billed as a rightwing comedian because he voted for Brexit and got a lot of stick when he went on Mock the Week. \u201cI fired a few shots at remainers and they were upset. Because Mock the Week has an established leftwing audience, so it shook them up a bit. But with The Mash Report I don\u2019t, because I was set up as who I am from the start.\u201d Sophie Duker thinks about audience expectations all the time. She\u2019s not so well known, so audiences can\u2019t predict where her comedy might go. \u201cThe way people receive me in different settings is so different,\u201d she says. \u201cSuper young, super cosmopolitan people, or older dudes in the sticks \u2013 I want both sets of people to like me and have a good time.\u201d Intent matters too. If a comedian says something outrageous, they may well be intending to make a point. Intent means that the best comedians can use offence as part of a complicated journey \u2013 via jokes \u2013 to get to an underlying truth. (If you\u2019re outraged, maybe you should wonder why.) Boyle, in his Instagram post, points out that jokes, in their simplest form, rely on outrage. There\u2019s a set-up and then, pow! The punchline is extreme, not ordinary. A joke is meant to shake you up. Jokes rely a lot on fear, and you laugh because you\u2019re a little bit scared of your reaction. Comedians know and love this. \u201cIf there\u2019s a joke where someone might be offended, I have to do it in front of them,\u201d says Duker. \u201cNot to offend them, but because I need to know that the material can work, even when I\u2019m scared of doing it.\u201d Because of all this, comedians are constantly listening to their audience. Which bit worked better? Why didn\u2019t that joke land? Are they laughing because they got the irony, or because they like the bigotry? Standups accept that they don\u2019t always get things right. Every comedian I speak to mentions that they have cut or rewritten jokes. Chaponda took out a gag that relied on a punchline about domestic violence. When Friedman released the DVD of her show American C*nt, she removed a gag about Caitlyn Jenner. \u201cEven if she\u2019s an OK target, now I\u2019ve met more trans people I don\u2019t want to attack this vulnerable population,\u201d she says. Josie Long used the word psychopathic, and was challenged, \u201cand I thought, I don\u2019t need to cling on to this\u201d. Often, comedians change jokes because of a conversation with an audience member who had experienced what they were joking about. Is the joke worth the hurt it\u2019s causing? Other times, though, comedians double down on their gags. Katy Brand had a routine about Christianity and she felt \u201cutterly confident\u201d in defending it because she was herself a teenage Christian, plus she had a theology degree. Stevenson put up a gag on Twitter about the difference between how depression is viewed in men and women. When some men objected, she pointed to examples like Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, but also to her own experience. When comedians assess jokes, cast aside quips, try out and test new gags, they\u2019re aware of the audience. But they also know that much of the joy of comedy is to be found along the fault lines of offence and etiquette. Where comedy functions is in those areas that need to be explored, where society is trying to work out what it thinks. The shifting of what society finds acceptable and what it doesn\u2019t is precisely where comedians operate. And being offended, of course, is a choice. So what do audiences find offensive? It depends on who\u2019s telling the joke. If you\u2019re a comedian with an established following, you can probably guess at your audience\u2019s sensibilities. With Jimmy Carr, for instance, everything appears to be a target. (But even he doesn\u2019t tell race jokes.) Long\u2019s audience has a different sensibility. Sometimes, though, people get upset in ways you can\u2019t predict. When Norcott appeared on Live at the Apollo, he says: \u201cI made jokes about Tories, concentration camps. But the bit that got everyone upset was when I said my wife likes shoes. But she does!\u201d Sometimes audiences get upset on behalf of others. Chaponda was attacked for saying he wasn\u2019t offended by Alan Sugar comparing the Senegal national football team to Marbella beach sellers. \u201cIt\u2019s paternalistic,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that all black people should feel the same. That\u2019s ignorant.\u201d He also takes issue with the idea that being offended is a bad thing. \u201cSome people have said that being offended is like being punched in the face,\u201d he says. \u201cI went to see Book of Mormon, and I loved a lot of it, but I was offended by some of the jokes about Africa and religion, because I\u2019m very religious. That offence was interesting, it made me look at my own prejudices. But it wasn\u2019t like being punched in the face.\u201d Not many people are as reasonable as Chaponda. Long reports that the general feeling of her audience is \u201canxious\u201d, and Brand says: \u201cNo one\u2019s very relaxed about anything at all at the moment.\u201d \u201cIf you feel genuinely besieged by some prevailing culture or mood that you don\u2019t feel comfortable in,\u201d she says, \u201cthen if you can put that general feeling of frustration and powerlessness into a vessel, that\u2019s a relief. It\u2019s exciting to be whipped up and join a group of people who all seem very angry. And there\u2019s a general feeling of besiegement on both sides.\u201d So comedians are becoming more vigilant about interpretation. Stevenson tells me about a time she made an off-the-cuff gag that could have been understood in a way she didn\u2019t want it to be. It bothered her so much that she returned to it during her set, explaining it to the audience. At another gig, where the audience was very PC, she could feel their discomfort when they laughed at a joke: \u201cI had to reassure them that I knew they weren\u2019t cheering for anti-abortionists. I could feel their panic.\u201d Stewart Lee says: \u201cI feel meaning and intent have to be evident right through a piece, like writing in a stick of rock, so it can\u2019t be snapped in two at any point by critics and repurposed.\u201d Lee might seem paranoid, but deliberate misunderstanding and social media pile-ons are common these days. Long was attacked on Twitter by Graham Linehan (writer of Father Ted) because they have differing views on trans rights. She didn\u2019t change her mind, but the ensuing furore led to her deleting her account for a while. \u201cI quite often do that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve been doing comedy since 2006 and there have been hate sites set up that talk about raping and murdering me. I\u2019ve had a far-right YouTuber decide to let his millions of fans attack me. I\u2019m not scared.\u201d Jena Friedman had a situation in a London comedy club where she confronted a heckler, but they sorted it out. He was a Bernie Sanders fan (Friedman is American), and when she tweeted about it using the pejorative epithet \u201cBernie bro\u201d, she was attacked by both left- and rightwingers.

It felt like a coordinated attack. I approached him and said: \u2018As a fellow comedian, why are you doing this?\u2019 But he has a YouTube show, a whole economy centred around this, he\u2019s making money, there\u2019s an entire ecosystem.\u201d Lee has noticed that some of his jokes that gently poke fun at his audience \u2013 \u201cmy own liberal constituency\u201d \u2013 have been stripped of context and weaponised online \u201cby alt-right types\u201d. \u201cThings I said as a joke 10 years ago, making fun of the sort of \u2018sensitive\u2019 standups whose shows I usually actually like, have been repurposed online,\u201d he writes. \u201cI made some jokes during the era of \u2018dead dad\u2019 one-man shows and they were repurposed as if they were intended to criticise Hannah Gadsby, who probably wasn\u2019t born when they were written.\u201d So now he goes to great lengths not to be misinterpreted.

Farage called Brand\u2019s joke \u201can incitement to violence\u201d and demanded that the police investigate. (Farage didn\u2019t hear it live, he was presenting his own radio show, on LBC.) Guido put the piece up on Twitter under the headline: \u201cJo Brand\u2019s Hate Speech\u201d, where it was picked up by Piers Morgan and others, including Leave.EU, Ukip, RT UK, and newspapers. Brand\u2019s joke, as the saying goes, went viral. There were radio phone-ins, Twitter shouting matches, police. Amazing, really. It was a joke. You have to wonder, sometimes, who\u2019s actually laughing. - Edinburgh festival fringe runs 2-26 August 2019.

      "body": "<p><strong>He\u2019s an opportunistic </strong>and populist Tory MP, who rises inexorably through his party. Remind you of somebody? I hear that David Hare is creating a new four-part drama series for BBC One, which is not \u2013 well, at least, not directly \u2013 about Boris Johnson, even if some of the characteristics are familiar. Interesting that Hare will have a Conservative at the centre of this series. The politicians in his dramas until now have been Labour, kicking off with 1993\u2019s <em>The Absence of War</em><em> </em>at the National, about a party leader who fails to win power, loosely based on Neil Kinnock in the 1992 election.</p> <p>Last year Hare portrayed a male Labour MP - played by John Simm - in his BBC Two series <em>Collateral</em>, and then, in his play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/10/im-not-running-review-david-hare-lyttelton-national-theatre\" title=\"\">I\u2019m Not Running</a></em>, a female one (Si\u00e2n Brooke), who stood for the leadership.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/06/david-hare-james-graham-drama-politics-labour-party\" title=\"\">Hare is the most political of writers</a>. Think of <em>Stuff Happens</em>, his response to the Iraq war, or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/jan/31/theatre\" title=\"\">The Permanent Way</a></em>, which looked back to the start of railway privatisation in 1991. Incidentally, that is being revived in London at <a href=\"https://www.londontheatredirect.com/news/casting-announced-for-the-permanent-way-at-the-vaults\" title=\"\">the Vaults</a>, the disused tunnels beneath Waterloo station. How appropriate!</p> <p>Now in his early 70s, Hare seems to be more prolific than ever. Yet, for me, his best plays are not the ones with grandstanding themes, but those on a smaller scale, such as <em>Skylight</em>, <em>The Judas Kiss</em>, <em>South Downs</em><em> </em>and <em>The Moderate Soprano</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05bc2f26fc91c9e9e04ebf1672eff47e30af56b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05bc2f26fc91c9e9e04ebf1672eff47e30af56b1/0_0_3599_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine in the 2016 hit The Night Manager.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hiddleston in the 2016 hit The Night Manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/AMC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What has happened</strong> to the follow-up series of BBC One\u2019s 2016 hit <em>The Night Manager</em>? I understand shooting was scheduled for this summer but has been called off. It means that Tom Hiddleston, who played the hotel manager turned spy, is free to go to Broadway with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/14/betrayal-review-a-haunting-reminder-of-deceptions-impact\" title=\"\">Jamie Lloyd\u2019s revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/14/betrayal-review-a-haunting-reminder-of-deceptions-impact\" title=\"\">Betrayal</a></em> (based on the playwright\u2019s affair with Joan Bakewell), which was a huge success in the West End earlier this year. The New York version begins next month and runs into December. So any <em>Night Manager</em> sequel can now only be shot next year.</p> <p>Also facing delays is the second <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2017/dec/30/misha-glenny-organised-crime-uncertainty-brexit-opportunity-mcmafia\" title=\"\">McMafia</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2017/dec/30/misha-glenny-organised-crime-uncertainty-brexit-opportunity-mcmafia\" title=\"\">, the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2017/dec/30/misha-glenny-organised-crime-uncertainty-brexit-opportunity-mcmafia\" title=\"\">BBC One</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2017/dec/30/misha-glenny-organised-crime-uncertainty-brexit-opportunity-mcmafia\" title=\"\"> hit from early 2018</a>. The problem is how to move the series on, although my difficulty was more with the lead actor, James Norton, who appeared to have had a charisma bypass to play the British son of a Russian mafia boss.</p> <p>Why is the TV industry so obsessed with sequels?

      "bodyText": "He\u2019s an opportunistic and populist Tory MP, who rises inexorably through his party. Remind you of somebody? I hear that David Hare is creating a new four-part drama series for BBC One, which is not \u2013 well, at least, not directly \u2013 about Boris Johnson, even if some of the characteristics are familiar. Interesting that Hare will have a Conservative at the centre of this series. The politicians in his dramas until now have been Labour, kicking off with 1993\u2019s The Absence of War at the National, about a party leader who fails to win power, loosely based on Neil Kinnock in the 1992 election. Last year Hare portrayed a male Labour MP - played by John Simm - in his BBC Two series Collateral, and then, in his play I\u2019m Not Running, a female one (Si\u00e2n Brooke), who stood for the leadership. Hare is the most political of writers. Think of Stuff Happens, his response to the Iraq war, or The Permanent Way, which looked back to the start of railway privatisation in 1991. Incidentally, that is being revived in London at the Vaults, the disused tunnels beneath Waterloo station. How appropriate! Now in his early 70s, Hare seems to be more prolific than ever. Yet, for me, his best plays are not the ones with grandstanding themes, but those on a smaller scale, such as Skylight, The Judas Kiss, South Downs and The Moderate Soprano. What has happened to the follow-up series of BBC One\u2019s 2016 hit The Night Manager? I understand shooting was scheduled for this summer but has been called off. It means that Tom Hiddleston, who played the hotel manager turned spy, is free to go to Broadway with Jamie Lloyd\u2019s revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal (based on the playwright\u2019s affair with Joan Bakewell), which was a huge success in the West End earlier this year. The New York version begins next month and runs into December. So any Night Manager sequel can now only be shot next year. Also facing delays is the second McMafia, the BBC One hit from early 2018. The problem is how to move the series on, although my difficulty was more with the lead actor, James Norton, who appeared to have had a charisma bypass to play the British son of a Russian mafia boss. Why is the TV industry so obsessed with sequels? Sometimes it\u2019s better to quit while you\u2019re ahead. Finally, back to Boris Johnson.

You will need to be a Brexit Tory \u2013 joining Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan as ready to ignore what you know to be true and right for the country in order to hold on to some political or cultural bauble. We are witnesses to a rightwing revolution whose final destination is an enforced nihilist libertarianism.</p> \n<p>What to do?

Yes, our capitalism will need to be reshaped, our political system overhauled and our social contract refashioned. But first and foremost comes EU membership, foundational for the rest.</p> \n<p>No united front is possible without the Labour party. Johnson has scorned Jeremy Corbyn as a Remainer.

Britain is European to its marrow \u2013 our interests, values, intertwined history, belief in a social contract and even our literature are European. We must make common cause with our neighbours, not exchange being the 28th member of the EU to become a non-voting state of the US. The shared ambition must be to build a generous society, living lives all have reason to value. Current levels of inequality are pernicious because they menace that possibility. There <em>is</em> such a thing as society.</p> \n<p>Our economy should be populated by companies that define their purpose one way or another as social betterment, including sustainability. The private and public sectors are interdependent parts of a functioning whole \u2013 the vibrancy of both is vital for the good of economy and society. The public sector needs proper resources to discharge its function, especially in terms of education and training, and those who work in it must be properly honoured for what they do. Our leaders should be characterised by duty, integrity and honesty. There is an environmental emergency: every aspect of policy should recognise this truth.</p> \n<p>The constitution must be organised as a federal Britain in which economic and political power is as close as possible to local people. We want a diverse truth-seeking media, with strong public service broadcasters. Culture is not some dispensable add-on. Music, art, theatre, TV and film speak to our souls.</p> \n<p>No common programme of this type is possible without political generosity. Suspend the vendetta against Blairites. Forget Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson\u2019s voting record when in government. She, in turn, should cease her criticisms of Corbyn.

      "bodyText": "Britain is not a rightwing country. There is no appetite to go on a national war footing with an accompanying recession in order to leave the EU without a deal. No appetite, either, for relishing the resulting decades of distrust and animosity with the rest of our continent. There remains overwhelming attachment to the idea of the United Kingdom, still substantial attachment to the idea of the European Union and wide distrust of Donald Trump\u2019s US. The great majority do not believe our major institutions \u2013 the civil service, the Bank of England, the judicial system \u2013 are broken because they will not blindly sign up to a no-deal Brexit. Yet the country is now governed by the most rightwing administration of modern times, led by a duplicitous rogue who wants the country to rally behind his absurd, fantasist rhetoric and to believe in a glorious future built on division, rupture and schoolboy patriotism. The talk about uniting the country with fake one-nation Tory commitments to education, \u201cleft-behind\u201d Britain and health are cloaks for a first-order threat to our civilisation, our values and who we are. Britain is at bottom a fair-minded, tolerant country whose citizens look out for each other. All that is to be submerged and forgotten. The Tory party has now completed its transmutation into a \u201crespectable\u201d version of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. To contain the ugly forces unleashed by Brexit, it has had to become the creature of its new master \u2013 the unparalleled brutality of the cabinet changes was but a part of that. Only thus is there any prospect of the party winning a general election. It is a coup, British style. In the future, it will not be enough to be a Tory to enjoy the benefits of patronage and accompanying social prestige that the party has always deployed to garner support. You will need to be a Brexit Tory \u2013 joining Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan as ready to ignore what you know to be true and right for the country in order to hold on to some political or cultural bauble. We are witnesses to a rightwing revolution whose final destination is an enforced nihilist libertarianism. What to do? The best of Britain must mount a united, full-fronted roar in response, protecting our values and advocating a wholly different programme to sustain our integrity and inclusiveness as a country while making common cause with the EU. Yes, our capitalism will need to be reshaped, our political system overhauled and our social contract refashioned. But first and foremost comes EU membership, foundational for the rest. No united front is possible without the Labour party. Johnson has scorned Jeremy Corbyn as a Remainer. The Labour leader should glory in the epithet, own it and turn it to his advantage \u2013 there is now no room for dissimulation and triangulation. In a de facto civil war initiated by the Brexit right, there is no middle ground. We are in a battle for the very idea of a country and the Labour leadership has to reaffirm that it is a national party and will in the national interest reach across party lines. Johnson\u2019s Brexit Tories, and their slavish fifth columnist press, are the new sectarian enemy. Labour has to make the case for Remain as the base for a wider common programme that it will negotiate with the Liberal Democrats, Greens and even dissident liberal Tories. Nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales should be welcomed to sign up; the promise will be a federal Britain inside the EU. They may refuse, but many of their voters will not. The elements are clear. Britain is European to its marrow \u2013 our interests, values, intertwined history, belief in a social contract and even our literature are European. We must make common cause with our neighbours, not exchange being the 28th member of the EU to become a non-voting state of the US. The shared ambition must be to build a generous society, living lives all have reason to value. Current levels of inequality are pernicious because they menace that possibility. There is such a thing as society. Our economy should be populated by companies that define their purpose one way or another as social betterment, including sustainability. The private and public sectors are interdependent parts of a functioning whole \u2013 the vibrancy of both is vital for the good of economy and society. The public sector needs proper resources to discharge its function, especially in terms of education and training, and those who work in it must be properly honoured for what they do. Our leaders should be characterised by duty, integrity and honesty. There is an environmental emergency: every aspect of policy should recognise this truth. The constitution must be organised as a federal Britain in which economic and political power is as close as possible to local people. We want a diverse truth-seeking media, with strong public service broadcasters. Culture is not some dispensable add-on. Music, art, theatre, TV and film speak to our souls. No common programme of this type is possible without political generosity. Suspend the vendetta against Blairites. Forget Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson\u2019s voting record when in government. She, in turn, should cease her criticisms of Corbyn. Corbyn himself must decide if he can lead such a common front or stand aside for those who will. Caroline Lucas and the Greens need to be recognised as representing a growing and powerful stream of opinion. One of the reasons for the rise of the right is the willingness of those on the liberal left to attack each other over second- and third-order differences; small gains while the big prize falls to the Brexit right. Now is the moment for a common programme, a common willingness to work together in parliament to block a no-deal Brexit and negotiate whatever pact possible for the inevitable general election. Johnson\u2019s ruthlessness in reinventing the Tory party as the party of Brexit has to be countered by the creation of an alternative programme for change \u2013 and a credible political architecture to deliver it. It\u2019s the challenge of our lives. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",

He has 14 first cousins who are, like him, an Irish-English mix and our circular rigmarole of pronouncing their names while he plays with them should give him a grounding in the Irish language.

It\u2019s near impossible to get 100%</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But questions of heritage rose afresh last week, when my sister Caoimhe got my dad an Ancestry profile and the whole family found ourselves rapt by our roots.</p> <p>Dad had looked into genealogy in the 90s, tracing the family tree back a century-and-a-half, before the entire square-tentacled mass retreated into a freckled full house of illiterate farmers. There were some odd additions \u2013 our great (x5) uncle Edward Maguire was, supposedly, chief of police of Chicago \u2013 but for the most part it was rustic sod-botherers. The dream is that you\u2019ll dig deep enough and find some improbable link to fame, fortune or foreign royalty. The best my dad could manage, back in the pre-internet days of library visits, census records and dusty birth documents, was to discover Derry\u2019s famed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/dr-edward-daly-derry-cleric-wounded-bloody-sunday-dies-aged-82\" title=\"\">Bishop Edward Daly</a>, a man he\u2019d been friends with all his life, was very slightly related to my grandmother, who\u2019d babysat the infant bishop.</p> <p>My father spent years at this and basically ended up with the same information he would have gotten if he\u2019d had a guess while very tired. It was as if he\u2019d spent two years opening a Kinder Egg, only to find inside a photo of the outside of a Kinder Egg.</p> <p>So, I was under no illusions. I\u2019m so offensively Irish, I could be one of those hilarious political cartoons you still get in British newspapers in 2019. I\u2019ve spent my entire life being called S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly, a name so unfathomably turf-scented, even other Irish people find it hilarious. But some small dream was alive inside. Maybe the new, modern, internet-enabled DNA-tracking methods would unveil my son\u2019s link to Persian aristocracy. Or Somali pirates.</p> <p>Alas, we found precisely the same Kinder Egg. Surpassing even our wildest disappointments, we discovered that my dad was 100% Irish. Not 96 or 98, but 100%. From what I\u2019ve read, it\u2019s near impossible to get 100%. Your ancestors would have to tether themselves to a tree and only have sex with people tethered to trees nearby, and repeat this for 1,000 years, to get 100%. But we managed it somehow.</p> <p>There was one upside, in that the service came with a list of hundreds of new second, third and further removed cousins, all of whom are now capable of getting to know me, and thus my son, through this service: 472 of them in total. I\u2019d better get him started on their names now.</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",

He has 14 first cousins who are, like him, an Irish-English mix and our circular rigmarole of pronouncing their names while he plays with them should give him a grounding in the Irish language. My own Irishness only comes up when someone presumes me to be English, and for my son\u2019s sake, I\u2019m getting better at not reacting to this in that disheartened way one does when cinema staff say, \u2018Will Pepsi do?\u2019 But questions of heritage rose afresh last week, when my sister Caoimhe got my dad an Ancestry profile and the whole family found ourselves rapt by our roots. Dad had looked into genealogy in the 90s, tracing the family tree back a century-and-a-half, before the entire square-tentacled mass retreated into a freckled full house of illiterate farmers. There were some odd additions \u2013 our great (x5) uncle Edward Maguire was, supposedly, chief of police of Chicago \u2013 but for the most part it was rustic sod-botherers. The dream is that you\u2019ll dig deep enough and find some improbable link to fame, fortune or foreign royalty. The best my dad could manage, back in the pre-internet days of library visits, census records and dusty birth documents, was to discover Derry\u2019s famed Bishop Edward Daly, a man he\u2019d been friends with all his life, was very slightly related to my grandmother, who\u2019d babysat the infant bishop. My father spent years at this and basically ended up with the same information he would have gotten if he\u2019d had a guess while very tired. It was as if he\u2019d spent two years opening a Kinder Egg, only to find inside a photo of the outside of a Kinder Egg. So, I was under no illusions. I\u2019m so offensively Irish, I could be one of those hilarious political cartoons you still get in British newspapers in 2019. I\u2019ve spent my entire life being called S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly, a name so unfathomably turf-scented, even other Irish people find it hilarious. But some small dream was alive inside. Maybe the new, modern, internet-enabled DNA-tracking methods would unveil my son\u2019s link to Persian aristocracy. Or Somali pirates. Alas, we found precisely the same Kinder Egg. Surpassing even our wildest disappointments, we discovered that my dad was 100% Irish. Not 96 or 98, but 100%. From what I\u2019ve read, it\u2019s near impossible to get 100%. Your ancestors would have to tether themselves to a tree and only have sex with people tethered to trees nearby, and repeat this for 1,000 years, to get 100%. But we managed it somehow. There was one upside, in that the service came with a list of hundreds of new second, third and further removed cousins, all of whom are now capable of getting to know me, and thus my son, through this service: 472 of them in total. I\u2019d better get him started on their names now. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

He looks over the final cut of a video, going out in 20 minutes. He has two phones, one for his daily use and another that he takes to the protests in case it gets damaged in the chaos. Chris is part of a group that calls itself StandwithHK, which has launched a media blitz aimed at the UK, calling on British residents to defend their country\u2019s former colony, Hong Kong. Full-page adverts appeared in major British newspapers, including the Guardian, while videos were launched on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. A flashmob was held in Trafalgar Square. An online petition automatically sends a letter to one\u2019s MP, based on the postcode given. On Sunday, protesters plan to hold rallies around the UK.

The announcement by Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 on Saturday followed the <a href=\"https://www.romaniajournal.ro/society-people/social/head-of-the-romanian-police-sacked-in-the-caracal-case-resignations-of-olt-prefect-and-police-chief-also-asked/\" title=\"\">sacking of the country\u2019s chief of police </a>after officers failed to respond to several emergency calls from a kidnapped 15-year-old girl who is believed to have subsequently been murdered.</p> <p>Despite the teenager telephoning police three times to report that she had been abducted, authorities waited 19 hours before attempting to rescue her \u2013 a delay that many Romanians believe cost the teenager\u2019s life.</p> <p>Hundreds of people gathered outside the suspect\u2019s house in the town of Caracal to protest on Friday.</p> <p>In response to widespread national outrage, the interior minister, Nicolae Moga fired the country\u2019s most senior police officer, Ioan Buda. \u201cI called for the sacking of the police chief \u2026 because drastic measures are required,\u201d said Moga.</p> <p>On Saturday D\u0103ncil\u0103 demanded an inquiry into the police response and called for punishment for all those responsible, and another two senior officers were abruptly sacked.</p> <p>The girl, who is identified only as Alexandra, was abducted on Wednesday as she tried to hitchhike home to the town of Dobrosloveni in the south of the country.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, she rang the emergency number, 112, three times and offered police what information she had about the place in which she was being held by the driver who picked her up. Buda told journalists she had shouted down the phone \u201che\u2019s coming, he\u2019s coming\u201d before the call was cut off.</p> <p>Relatives of Alexandra alleged that officers failed to take the alert seriously and reacted too late. A Facebook post by a man identified as the victim\u2019s uncle said: \u201cMy niece Alexandra may have been killed while police and prosecutors \u2018guarded\u2019 the criminal. A few heads have fallen but not enough!\u201d</p> <p>Three buildings were searched by officers before they finally pinpointed the property where she had been held, more than 12 hours after her calls.</p> <p>Police then sought a search warrant \u2013 which is not required in emergencies \u2013 and then waited until dawn to enter the house, 19 hours after Alexandra\u2019s last call. They found \u201chuman remains\u201d, which are being analysed, and jewellery the girl wore, police said.</p> <p>On Saturday morning, the authorities arrested a 66-year-old mechanic, named as Gheorghe Dinc\u0103, and placed him in custody on suspicion of juvenile trafficking and rape.</p> <p>Later, Dinc\u0103\u2019s court-appointed lawyer, Alexandru Bogdan, told reporters that his client had told prosecutors that he did know the girl but that he was not guilty.</p> <p>There is \u201cevidence to be determined by expertise, like what kind of bones they are,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cIt is premature to discuss about guilt based on these clues.\u201d</p> <p>The lawyer also added that the victim\u2019s calls appeared to have been made from Dinc\u0103\u2019s phone, although his client had not explained this.</p> <p>As the emerging details of the case continued to provoke alarm and anger, Romania\u2019s president, Klaus Iohannis, issued a statement saying he was \u201cdeeply saddened by the tragedy\u201d and \u201crevolted by the fact that, due to some malfunctions, the responsible authorities have failed to save a teenage girl who has lost her life under dramatic conditions\u201d.</p> <p>The case has also prompted questions over the sudden disappearance of another local teenager who has been missing since April, apparently also after hitching a ride.</p> <p>Forensic analysts were working to identify the human remains found at the property on Saturday night.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Romania\u2019s prime minister is considering calling a referendum on harsher penalties for crimes such as murder, rape and paedophilia. The announcement by Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 on Saturday followed the sacking of the country\u2019s chief of police after officers failed to respond to several emergency calls from a kidnapped 15-year-old girl who is believed to have subsequently been murdered. Despite the teenager telephoning police three times to report that she had been abducted, authorities waited 19 hours before attempting to rescue her \u2013 a delay that many Romanians believe cost the teenager\u2019s life. Hundreds of people gathered outside the suspect\u2019s house in the town of Caracal to protest on Friday. In response to widespread national outrage, the interior minister, Nicolae Moga fired the country\u2019s most senior police officer, Ioan Buda. \u201cI called for the sacking of the police chief \u2026 because drastic measures are required,\u201d said Moga. On Saturday D\u0103ncil\u0103 demanded an inquiry into the police response and called for punishment for all those responsible, and another two senior officers were abruptly sacked. The girl, who is identified only as Alexandra, was abducted on Wednesday as she tried to hitchhike home to the town of Dobrosloveni in the south of the country. On Thursday morning, she rang the emergency number, 112, three times and offered police what information she had about the place in which she was being held by the driver who picked her up. Buda told journalists she had shouted down the phone \u201che\u2019s coming, he\u2019s coming\u201d before the call was cut off. Relatives of Alexandra alleged that officers failed to take the alert seriously and reacted too late. A Facebook post by a man identified as the victim\u2019s uncle said: \u201cMy niece Alexandra may have been killed while police and prosecutors \u2018guarded\u2019 the criminal. A few heads have fallen but not enough!\u201d Three buildings were searched by officers before they finally pinpointed the property where she had been held, more than 12 hours after her calls. Police then sought a search warrant \u2013 which is not required in emergencies \u2013 and then waited until dawn to enter the house, 19 hours after Alexandra\u2019s last call. They found \u201chuman remains\u201d, which are being analysed, and jewellery the girl wore, police said. On Saturday morning, the authorities arrested a 66-year-old mechanic, named as Gheorghe Dinc\u0103, and placed him in custody on suspicion of juvenile trafficking and rape. Later, Dinc\u0103\u2019s court-appointed lawyer, Alexandru Bogdan, told reporters that his client had told prosecutors that he did know the girl but that he was not guilty. There is \u201cevidence to be determined by expertise, like what kind of bones they are,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cIt is premature to discuss about guilt based on these clues.\u201d The lawyer also added that the victim\u2019s calls appeared to have been made from Dinc\u0103\u2019s phone, although his client had not explained this. As the emerging details of the case continued to provoke alarm and anger, Romania\u2019s president, Klaus Iohannis, issued a statement saying he was \u201cdeeply saddened by the tragedy\u201d and \u201crevolted by the fact that, due to some malfunctions, the responsible authorities have failed to save a teenage girl who has lost her life under dramatic conditions\u201d. The case has also prompted questions over the sudden disappearance of another local teenager who has been missing since April, apparently also after hitching a ride. Forensic analysts were working to identify the human remains found at the property on Saturday night.",

I\u2019ll be zooming around all corners of the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there was no doubt Johnson was in campaign mode and aiming squarely at the disillusioned backers of Brexit. In front of Robert Stephenson\u2019s Rocket locomotive, built to run on the world\u2019s first intercity passenger rail line between Liverpool and Manchester, he made a series of pledges around local transport, housing and heritage that made him sound more like a power-mad local mayor than a prime minister.</p> <p>Speaking of struggling young people growing up in fading municipal towns with proud histories, he said: \u201cThey haven\u2019t failed. It\u2019s we, us, the politicians, our politics has failed them.\u201d People who voted for Brexit in the north weren\u2019t just voting against Brussels, he said. \u201cThey were voting against London, too, and against all concentrations of power in remote centres.\u201d</p> <p>There was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/27/critics-doubt-boris-johnson-can-deliver-new-rail-route-pledge\" title=\"\">an expensive list of policy fixes</a>. The flagship announcement was a \u00a33.6bn fund for left-behind communities, to be handed to 100 towns in the first instance. In effect, it is an expansion of a scheme first announced by May as she attempted to win support for her Brexit deal from Labour MPs.</p> <p>He also pledged to fund a new rail link between Manchester and Leeds and improved bus services in the short term. It comes on top of his commitments, repeated in his address, to spend tens of billions on police, improving school funding and increasing broadband access.</p> <p>The question is whether Johnson will be more effective than May in scooping up Labour Leavers \u2013 and while May effectively killed off Ukip, Johnson also has to deal with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party.</p> <p>\u201cThere are differences now,\u201d says one senior Tory opponent of the new prime minister. \u201cBack then, Theresa May, to her credit, tried to do some important and difficult things as part of her campaign that proved to be unpopular. Johnson will have absolutely no time for anything similar.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, moderate Tories are convinced that the bid to win Leave votes will hand the Liberal Democrats and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/jo-swinson-summer-tour-viable-pm-sarah-wollaston\" title=\"\">their new leader Jo Swinson</a> the chance to pick up Tory Remainers. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, but the net result at the moment looks like we\u2019re standing still,\u201d said one former minister.</p> <p>Labour is also trying to counter the Johnson threat to its turf. Insiders say detailed analysis has been done and a summer tour of marginal seats is planned. It is understood two months have been spent planning and testing a strategy against Johnson. Labour\u2019s internal research, insiders claim, suggests that Johnson now has limited ability to reach across party lines and his appeal to Labour Leave voters has declined through the Tory leadership campaign.</p> <p>Their plan acknowledges that the \u201cgame has changed\u201d and that the party needs to capitalise on the Tory admission that higher public spending is needed. \u201cBy moving on to our territory, accepting our terms on the economy, we\u2019re in control of the narrative,\u201d claimed one insider. \u201cJohnson and his hard-right cabinet will never convince the voters they\u2019re more in touch with ordinary people on issues like the NHS and schools.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Westminster notes</strong></h2> <p>Power mad already</p> <p>Several newly appointed ministers are already laying down the law to their officials. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has imposed a two-page limit on briefings and warned he will \u201cpay attention to the font sizes and margins\u201d. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has been insisting on his favourite pink cup for his coffee. And Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has demanded double spaces after full stops and deemed the word \u201cunacceptable\u201d unacceptable. All the big issues tackled.</p> <p>Calling for nurse</p> <p>At the end of the reshuffle, eyebrows were raised at the return of Nadine Dorries, the outspoken pro-Brexit Tory MP. The former nurse is now a junior health minister. She once described David Cameron and George Osborne as \u201ctwo posh boys who don\u2019t know the price of milk\u201d, but she is set to struggle to keep track of the price of paracetamol as a no-deal Brexit ensures it becomes a precious commodity.</p> <p>Brexit \u2018hard man\u2019 flexes muscles</p> <p>Self-styled \u201cBrexit hard man\u201d Steve Baker, a leading rebel under Theresa May, turned down a ministerial job offer from the new prime minister. Apparently, Baker\u2019s principles meant he could not bear to be muzzled by being in office - or was cross at not being offered something that better suited his immense skillset.</p>",

At a podium stood Boris Johnson, a campaigning Conservative prime minister, promising to deliver Brexit, support Britain\u2019s towns, provide better housing and improve local schools. It was a little over two years ago that Theresa May, his ousted predecessor, included almost identical commitments as she launched her party\u2019s election campaign just a few miles up the road in Bolton, admittedly in less bombastic fashion.

In front of Robert Stephenson\u2019s Rocket locomotive, built to run on the world\u2019s first intercity passenger rail line between Liverpool and Manchester, he made a series of pledges around local transport, housing and heritage that made him sound more like a power-mad local mayor than a prime minister. Speaking of struggling young people growing up in fading municipal towns with proud histories, he said: \u201cThey haven\u2019t failed. It\u2019s we, us, the politicians, our politics has failed them.\u201d People who voted for Brexit in the north weren\u2019t just voting against Brussels, he said. \u201cThey were voting against London, too, and against all concentrations of power in remote centres.\u201d There was also an expensive list of policy fixes. The flagship announcement was a \u00a33.6bn fund for left-behind communities, to be handed to 100 towns in the first instance. In effect, it is an expansion of a scheme first announced by May as she attempted to win support for her Brexit deal from Labour MPs. He also pledged to fund a new rail link between Manchester and Leeds and improved bus services in the short term. It comes on top of his commitments, repeated in his address, to spend tens of billions on police, improving school funding and increasing broadband access. The question is whether Johnson will be more effective than May in scooping up Labour Leavers \u2013 and while May effectively killed off Ukip, Johnson also has to deal with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. \u201cThere are differences now,\u201d says one senior Tory opponent of the new prime minister. \u201cBack then, Theresa May, to her credit, tried to do some important and difficult things as part of her campaign that proved to be unpopular. Johnson will have absolutely no time for anything similar.\u201d Meanwhile, moderate Tories are convinced that the bid to win Leave votes will hand the Liberal Democrats and their new leader Jo Swinson the chance to pick up Tory Remainers. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, but the net result at the moment looks like we\u2019re standing still,\u201d said one former minister. Labour is also trying to counter the Johnson threat to its turf. Insiders say detailed analysis has been done and a summer tour of marginal seats is planned. It is understood two months have been spent planning and testing a strategy against Johnson. Labour\u2019s internal research, insiders claim, suggests that Johnson now has limited ability to reach across party lines and his appeal to Labour Leave voters has declined through the Tory leadership campaign. Their plan acknowledges that the \u201cgame has changed\u201d and that the party needs to capitalise on the Tory admission that higher public spending is needed. \u201cBy moving on to our territory, accepting our terms on the economy, we\u2019re in control of the narrative,\u201d claimed one insider. \u201cJohnson and his hard-right cabinet will never convince the voters they\u2019re more in touch with ordinary people on issues like the NHS and schools.\u201d Westminster notes Power mad already Several newly appointed ministers are already laying down the law to their officials. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has imposed a two-page limit on briefings and warned he will \u201cpay attention to the font sizes and margins\u201d. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has been insisting on his favourite pink cup for his coffee. And Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has demanded double spaces after full stops and deemed the word \u201cunacceptable\u201d unacceptable. All the big issues tackled. Calling for nurse At the end of the reshuffle, eyebrows were raised at the return of Nadine Dorries, the outspoken pro-Brexit Tory MP. The former nurse is now a junior health minister. She once described David Cameron and George Osborne as \u201ctwo posh boys who don\u2019t know the price of milk\u201d, but she is set to struggle to keep track of the price of paracetamol as a no-deal Brexit ensures it becomes a precious commodity. Brexit \u2018hard man\u2019 flexes muscles Self-styled \u201cBrexit hard man\u201d Steve Baker, a leading rebel under Theresa May, turned down a ministerial job offer from the new prime minister. Apparently, Baker\u2019s principles meant he could not bear to be muzzled by being in office - or was cross at not being offered something that better suited his immense skillset.",

The new chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is in charge of no-deal preparations in the Cabinet Office, said there was a \u201cvery real prospect\u201d(\u00a3) that an agreement would not be struck with Brussels before that deadline. Writing in the Sunday Times, he said that while the aim was still to leave with a deal, the government needed to prepare for every eventuality. \u201cWith a new prime minister, a new government, and a new clarity of mission, we will exit the EU on October 31. No ifs. No buts. No more delay. Brexit is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe EU\u2019s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach \u2013 it\u2019s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it,\u201d he added. \u201cWe still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not.\u201d Gove said the government would do \u201ceverything in our power\u201d to secure a good deal for the UK, but said simply presenting Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to Parliament again would not be enough. \u201cYou can\u2019t just reheat the dish that\u2019s been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,\u201d he wrote. Planning for no deal was now a \u201cnumber one priority\u201d, he said, as the paper reported that Boris Johnson had put together a \u201cwar cabinet\u201d of six key ministers to deliver Brexit by 31 October \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. Chancellor Sajid Javid has said there will be \u201csignificant extra funding\u201d this week to get Britain \u201cfully ready to leave\u201d the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. The additional spending will include financing one of the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever public information campaigns\u201d to ensure individuals and businesses were ready for a no-deal exit, Javid told the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cUnder my leadership, the Treasury will have new priorities and will play its full role in helping to deliver Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my first day in office as chancellor, I tasked officials to urgently identify where more money needs to be invested to get Britain fully ready to leave on October 31 \u2013 deal or no deal.\u201d He added that he planned to fund 500 new Border Force officers and look at new infrastructure around the country\u2019s ports to minimise congestion and ensure goods could flow. Meanwhile, polls have suggested the Tories were boosted by a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d after the election of their new leader. Since Johnson became prime minister, the Conservatives have gained 10 points to stand at 30%, new polling by Opinium for the Observer shows. The polling shows the Conservatives benefitting from a surge in support away from The Brexit party. Despite being pushed into second place, Labour are also up three points to 28% at the expense of the Green party.",

Swimming Australia CEO Leigh Russell told reporters on Sunday the delay in revealing the positive test to the public was a matter of internal policy. \u201cWe must wait until Asada or the particular athlete speaks on any matter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have some very strict confidentiality agreements in place.\u201d Russell revealed her distress when Mack Horton staged his world titles anti-doping protest last weekend against controversial Chinese star Sun Yang, knowing that Jack had tested positive. But one of the few others who knew about Jack\u2019s plight at the time, the Australian team head coach Jacco Verhaeren, said he didn\u2019t feel awkward and would have joined Horton\u2019s podium protest if he could. Asked if she had her \u201chead in her hands\u201d when Horton failed to acknowledge Sun, Russell said: \u201cYes, it was such a difficult one. \u201cI absolutely support Mack. He\u2019s entitled to say and do on an issue that he is passionate about and we are too, this has not changed our thinking on a zero-tolerance approach or our policy. \u201cBut I certainly was watching Mack (protest), distressed about what would befall both Shayna and Mack in the coming days and week (once positive test broke).\u201d Verhaeren did not believe Jack\u2019s positive test had tarnished Horton\u2019s protest message and claimed the Olympic champion would still have done it if he knew about Jack\u2019s test. \u201cThe question is going to be asked \u2018should he have done that?\u2019,\u201d Verhaeren said in Gwangju. \u201cI think yes because that is a totally different subject as well. This is about someone standing up for clean sport and we still do that. \u201cIf the meet started tomorrow with this knowledge he would stand there again and if I could I would stand next to him.\u201d Horton refused to take the podium with Sun after the Chinese swimmer won the gold in the 400m freestyle. Horton and other swimmers have been angry that Sun was allowed to contest the titles ahead of a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing in September. Sun is accused of allegedly smashing vials of blood samples with a hammer during a routine out-of-competition drug test. The 27-year-old previously served a three-month ban in 2014 for doping after testing positive for a banned stimulant. Australian team swimmers competing in South Korea weren\u2019t told of Jack\u2019s positive drug test until the news broke on Saturday, a month later. Russell said she understood Jack had been planning to reveal the news later this week, after the world titles ended, when it would not be a distraction for the Dolphins. The substance Jack tested positive to has not been revealed and that may not be made public for months, unless the swimmer chooses to announce it, as the matter is bound by confidentiality while it is investigated. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting a very quick resolution to this process,\u201d Russell said. Jack says she would never knowingly take a banned substance and has no idea how she came to test positive. Russell said Jack was at home in Brisbane with plenty of family support and was also being supported by Swimming Australia.",

      "bodyText": "The former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond held private talks with Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer shortly before Boris Johnson entered Downing Street last Wednesday, to plot cross-party moves aimed at preventing the new prime minister agreeing to a no-deal Brexit. The meeting in the House of Commons \u2013 which took place shortly after Hammond had resigned from the government \u2013 is evidence of the fierce backlash Johnson faces from MPs of all parties if he tries to defy parliament and take the UK out of the EU without an agreement on 31 October. It is understood that the former political opponents Hammond and Starmer agreed to work together through the summer recess with other leading parliamentarians who oppose no deal, including former Tory ministers Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, to thrash out how best to use parliamentary votes to torpedo no deal. On Saturday night Starmer confirmed that Johnson\u2019s arrival in No 10 had spurred more cross-party discussions at high levels involving senior Tories sacked by Johnson, or who chose to resign, as opponents of no deal prepared a cross-party counter-offensive against his new hard-Brexit cabinet and government. \u201cThe political direction of travel under Boris Johnson is clear,\u201d said Starmer, \u201cand so it is more important than ever that we build a strong cross-party alliance to stop a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThat work will intensify over the summer, before parliament resumes in September.\u201d The plans being hatched include amending Brexit-related legislation that has to pass through parliament before the UK can leave the EU in a way that would force the Johnson to ask for a further extension to the UK\u2019s membership if no Brexit agreement has been reached by early October. A \u201clast resort\u201d option is for Hammond and other Tory Remainers to vote for a no-confidence motion in their own government if no deal still appears on the cards. A new Opinium/Observer poll on Sunday will heighten fears among Remainers that Johnson could resort to calling a snap Brexit election to seek a mandate for a no-deal Brexit if he fails to persuade EU leaders to reopen talks on the Irish backstop and Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. The poll, conducted after Johnson was elected Tory leader, shows a marked \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, putting the Tories up seven points compared with a fortnight ago, on 30%. The Conservatives have leapfrogged Labour (which is 3 points up on 28%) to retake the lead. The surge in support appears to come at the expense of the Brexit party which has dropped 7 points to 15%. The Liberal Democrats, whose new leader Jo Swinson took office last week, are up 1 point on 16%. Johnson also has a 21-point lead over Jeremy Corbyn when voters are asked who would make the best prime minister. It is the biggest lead since May forged ahead of Corbyn before the 2017 election.

      "body": "<p>Gemma Chan is nervous, as if she\u2019s waiting for the dentist to perform a particularly painful extraction. We meet in a caf\u00e9 filled with babies and tired-looking mothers, in a fancy, rich-people part of north London. The setting is appropriate, given what we\u2019re here to talk about: <em>I Am Hannah</em>, the new improvised Channel 4 drama she co-created with director Dominic Savage. It tells the story of a woman in her mid-30s who dates, scattershot, via apps, while feeling the weight of the biological and social pressures to have a baby. Chan, 36, is keen to point out that it is not autobiographical.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, God. I have friends who are so happily married with children, on their third, some friends who\u2019ve done it who are struggling with elements of it, and other friends who have no interest in it, are free and single.\u201d She inhales sharply. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s weird. I do find it strange that in your 30s, suddenly, you become more aware that, if I\u2019m going to do it, try to have a biological child, I need to think about it now.\u201d She clams up. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have anything to add to that.\u201d</p> <p>It takes a while for her nerves to ease. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m naturally quite shy. I\u2019ve had to work really hard to mask that, not appear anxious or nervous.\u201d Red carpets are tricky for her, even now. She always worries she\u2019s going to fall over. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve nearly fainted before, because you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re not breathing and all of the flashes start going off in your face, and I\u2019ve started to\u2026\u201d She mock-swoons. \u201cImagine!\u201d To deal with it, she puts on a character, her own version of Sasha Fierce, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s alter ego. \u201cIn character I feel like I can do anything, really. That\u2019s part of what attracted me to acting. But if you ask me to make a speech as me, I find that so difficult. I hate my own birthday, I hate being the centre of attention.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f31c248a41bdb1da63b2dff6b319948d0e46dca8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31c248a41bdb1da63b2dff6b319948d0e46dca8/449_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In character I feel like I can do anything, but I\u2019m naturally quite shy\u2019: with Lisa Lu in Crazy Rich Asians.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In character I feel like I can do anything, but I\u2019m naturally quite shy\u2019: with Lisa Lu in Crazy Rich Asians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the level of Chan\u2019s recent success, she may have to start getting used to it. After slowly beginning her career in British television, she has hit Hollywood with a vengeance, playing Minn-Erva in <em>Captain Marvel</em>, which required being at work before 3am for four hours of hair and makeup, as her character was entirely blue. She was Bess of Hardwick in <em>Mary Queen of Scots</em>, and Madam Ya Zhou in <em>Fantastic Beasts</em><em> and Where to Find Them</em>. Then there was <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, which cemented her status as an international star when she played Astrid, an elegant, ultra-wealthy socialite whose surface perfection covered up a hidden pain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d be on a set and not only would I be the only Asian, I\u2019d be the only actor of colour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For someone who is so reticent in interviews, so reluctant to give anything away, Chan hints at a rebellious side that doesn\u2019t come out much in public. She\u2019s \u201cquite lazy,\u201d she says and \u201cI definitely have always been fly by the seat of my pants. If I can leave things until the last minute, I will.\u201d She was not always well behaved at school, she claims, and she has never liked authority. Has that carried through to her adult life? \u201cErr, yeah,\u201d she laughs. \u201cYes. Oh, God.\u201d But she won\u2019t tell me how. \u201cThere\u2019s just a little bit of a naughty side. Everything I can think of is either lame or I can\u2019t say it.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps there\u2019s an indication in what happened to her at this year\u2019s Met Gala, where Tom Ford dressed her in an Elizabeth Taylor-inspired look, adhering to the camp theme perfectly. \u201cThat whole experience was so surreal,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re in line, and literally every person around you, it\u2019s like being in Madame Tussauds. I had Joan Collins on one side, Kim Kardashian and Kanye in front of me. Gwyneth just there. They\u2019re all talking to each other, because they know each other, and you\u2019re just standing there going, this is mental.\u201d</p> <p>When Chan went to her hotel to change into her second look, she found herself on a bus back to the afterparty with Celine Dion. \u201cShe was an absolute fucking legend,\u201d she says, happily. \u201cIt was me and her and her dancers, just dancing on this bus. It was the best half an hour of my life.\u201d There is a video, but she vows that it will never be seen. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it happened. Nothing will top that. I pole-danced on a bus with Celine Dion.\u201d</p> <p>Was it being part of the <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> phenomenon that led her to the point of riding on a party bus with Celine Dion? \u201cI think that\u2019s fair to say, yes,\u201d says Chan. \u201cI look back on it now and I couldn\u2019t have imagined that film being made, even five years ago.

After school, she studied law at Oxford University (she chose Worcester College because it had an even male/female and state school/private school split). She eventually won a job at a law firm, but deferred the placement for two years in a row before finally turning it down to go to drama school. \u201cI realise that what had initially attracted me to law was watching films that were courtroom dramas and barristers giving these amazing speeches,\u201d she laughs. She says she just hadn\u2019t known it was possible to be a professional actor.</p> <p>Telling her parents she was going to pursue acting and not law was difficult. \u201cI knew how important education was because of my parents,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s what got my dad out of poverty, enabled his siblings to, and it meant he could come to the UK.\u201d It made the decision hard. \u201cIt was really, really painful. I hated that. I hated causing them pain.\u201d They did not take the news well. \u201cI feel bad for talking about it now because they\u2019re so proud and supportive. But I totally understand where they were coming from. It was a pure fear of not knowing whether I was going to be all right. Both my parents are immigrants. They came from nothing, had to work so hard, and so the idea for them, I suppose, of taking a risk, that wasn\u2019t a luxury they had. I always knew that was the luxury and privilege that I had, that they had given me.\u201d</p> <p>When Chan left drama school, one of her teachers told her she might find it difficult to get acting jobs. I ask if it was meant kindly. \u201cErm,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it was meant well, but it was also said quite bluntly, as well. In a way, they were right. At that time, 11 years ago, there were very, very few opportunities on British TV if you were an actor of colour and the logical thing would have been to go to America.\u201d The teacher had told her that she\u2019d have more of a shot if she crossed the Atlantic. \u201cBut I really wanted to try and make it work in the UK. I wanted to give that a chance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f5e7d4ffeacf1547684feb0dc14385cd5840ba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f5e7d4ffeacf1547684feb0dc14385cd5840ba7/0_0_2249_3488/645.jpg\" alt=\"Dress rehearsal: with Tom Ford celebrating the opening of Camp: Notes on Fashion, Arrivals at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in May 2019.\" width=\"645\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress rehearsal: with Tom Ford celebrating the opening of Camp: Notes on Fashion, Arrivals at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ovidiu Hrubaru/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I mention a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/idris-elba\" title=\"\">Idris Elba</a>, in which the actor was asked about race, and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve turned a corner until we don\u2019t have to talk about it.\u201d Chan says she gets where he\u2019s coming from. \u201cThe ideal place would be for it to be completely normalised and not a big deal.

But definitely at the beginning, there was nothing out there that was remotely a good part that I would be able to audition for. I wouldn\u2019t be called in for anything that was a lead role.\u201d She decided she needed to get as much experience as she could. She took everything she was offered and built up her career, small part by small part. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t going to be handed to me in any way. I suppose that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>For a while,<em><strong> </strong></em>Chan was a tabloid regular, in part because of her years-long relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jack-whitehall\" title=\"\">Jack Whitehall</a>, which ended in 2017.

      "bodyText": "Gemma Chan is nervous, as if she\u2019s waiting for the dentist to perform a particularly painful extraction. We meet in a caf\u00e9 filled with babies and tired-looking mothers, in a fancy, rich-people part of north London. The setting is appropriate, given what we\u2019re here to talk about: I Am Hannah, the new improvised Channel 4 drama she co-created with director Dominic Savage. It tells the story of a woman in her mid-30s who dates, scattershot, via apps, while feeling the weight of the biological and social pressures to have a baby. Chan, 36, is keen to point out that it is not autobiographical. \u201cI mean, God. I have friends who are so happily married with children, on their third, some friends who\u2019ve done it who are struggling with elements of it, and other friends who have no interest in it, are free and single.\u201d She inhales sharply. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s weird. I do find it strange that in your 30s, suddenly, you become more aware that, if I\u2019m going to do it, try to have a biological child, I need to think about it now.\u201d She clams up. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have anything to add to that.\u201d It takes a while for her nerves to ease. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m naturally quite shy. I\u2019ve had to work really hard to mask that, not appear anxious or nervous.\u201d Red carpets are tricky for her, even now. She always worries she\u2019s going to fall over. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve nearly fainted before, because you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re not breathing and all of the flashes start going off in your face, and I\u2019ve started to\u2026\u201d She mock-swoons. \u201cImagine!\u201d To deal with it, she puts on a character, her own version of Sasha Fierce, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s alter ego. \u201cIn character I feel like I can do anything, really. That\u2019s part of what attracted me to acting. But if you ask me to make a speech as me, I find that so difficult. I hate my own birthday, I hate being the centre of attention.\u201d Given the level of Chan\u2019s recent success, she may have to start getting used to it. After slowly beginning her career in British television, she has hit Hollywood with a vengeance, playing Minn-Erva in Captain Marvel, which required being at work before 3am for four hours of hair and makeup, as her character was entirely blue. She was Bess of Hardwick in Mary Queen of Scots, and Madam Ya Zhou in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Then there was Crazy Rich Asians, which cemented her status as an international star when she played Astrid, an elegant, ultra-wealthy socialite whose surface perfection covered up a hidden pain. For someone who is so reticent in interviews, so reluctant to give anything away, Chan hints at a rebellious side that doesn\u2019t come out much in public. She\u2019s \u201cquite lazy,\u201d she says and \u201cI definitely have always been fly by the seat of my pants. If I can leave things until the last minute, I will.\u201d She was not always well behaved at school, she claims, and she has never liked authority. Has that carried through to her adult life? \u201cErr, yeah,\u201d she laughs. \u201cYes. Oh, God.\u201d But she won\u2019t tell me how. \u201cThere\u2019s just a little bit of a naughty side. Everything I can think of is either lame or I can\u2019t say it.\u201d Perhaps there\u2019s an indication in what happened to her at this year\u2019s Met Gala, where Tom Ford dressed her in an Elizabeth Taylor-inspired look, adhering to the camp theme perfectly. \u201cThat whole experience was so surreal,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re in line, and literally every person around you, it\u2019s like being in Madame Tussauds. I had Joan Collins on one side, Kim Kardashian and Kanye in front of me. Gwyneth just there. They\u2019re all talking to each other, because they know each other, and you\u2019re just standing there going, this is mental.\u201d When Chan went to her hotel to change into her second look, she found herself on a bus back to the afterparty with Celine Dion. \u201cShe was an absolute fucking legend,\u201d she says, happily. \u201cIt was me and her and her dancers, just dancing on this bus. It was the best half an hour of my life.\u201d There is a video, but she vows that it will never be seen. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it happened. Nothing will top that. I pole-danced on a bus with Celine Dion.\u201d Was it being part of the Crazy Rich Asians phenomenon that led her to the point of riding on a party bus with Celine Dion? \u201cI think that\u2019s fair to say, yes,\u201d says Chan. \u201cI look back on it now and I couldn\u2019t have imagined that film being made, even five years ago. I feel so lucky that I was a part of it.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd not to overhype it or overegg it or anything, but I took my mum and dad with me to the premiere in London, and they were just in tears. My mum said to me, she never expected to see people [on screen] who looked like her family, the food that we ate, music that was in the soundtrack that she hadn\u2019t heard since her childhood.

      "body": "<p>The history of the many incarnations and issues of the Pride movement is explored in this earnest, informative but sometimes unwieldy documentary. Ashley Joiner\u2019s thoroughly researched film contextualises Pride as a celebration born out of a reaction to the hostility, repression and incomprehension faced by gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans and queer people. But even within something as theoretically unifying as Pride, not everyone feels included.

Ribbons on the gondoliers\u2019 hats flutter out of focus, bouquets adorn the boats. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to think you\u2019re watching an art film set in Venice,\u201d recalls director Jeff Stark. But you weren\u2019t. You were watching a beer ad filmed under leaden skies on Manchester\u2019s grimiest waterway.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe shot really tight at first so that the bridges looked Venetian \u2013 or just about.\u201d A scratchy recording of O Sole Mio completes the mood. Purists will complain that the 19th-century song was Neopolitan rather than Venetian, but that misses the point. \u201cWe used it to spoof the Cornetto ad that was popular at the time,\u201d Stark explains. </p> \n<p>In Stark\u2019s 1993 ad for Boddingtons, he cuts to an aerial shot and we see that the young man is holding something that looks like ice cream. \u201cAs the gondolas pass by each other, she leans over as if for a kiss and ... nicks his pint!\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWA3r5zMwAU\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZWA3r5zMwAU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The beer thief was played by Anna Chancellor. \u201cShe was a nobody at the time.\u201d She got the role after taking part in what used to be known as a \u201ccattle call\u201d: \u201cTwo minutes of audition and \u2018Next!\u2019\u201d I told Anna to drink the beer like a man and then wipe the froth from her mouth as she sat in the gondola. When she did, the lipstick smeared up her cheek. The makeup woman rushed over and said: \u2018You can\u2019t do that!\u2019 But I said: \u2018Hang on! That\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>And so it happened that, wide-eyed and lipstick-smeared, Chancellor uttered the immortal line: \u201cBy \u2019eck, it\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d Thanks to the help of a dialect coach, Somerset-raised, boarding school-educated Chancellor sounded more Noel Gallagher than Noel Coward. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cdfb7916-2bf5-4323-a87c-eba878c7cc82\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals.

There is a possibility that ad agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty\u2019s Cream of Manchester ad campaign, which ran from 1991 until 1999 and is credited with revitalising the city\u2019s image, is responsible for that transformation. According to the Manchester Evening News, Stark\u2019s ad \u201ctold the world something about the reinvention of the murky old city, that its once-filthy waterway could almost pass for Venice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since then, stretches of canal and rivers flowing through Manchester have undergone huge makeovers, with developments including Salford Quays transforming the city\u2019s waterfronts. The Irwell now is used for rowing and pleasure cruises while parts of it have become wildlife havens. As yet, though, there is no regular gondola service.</p> \n<p>But there is a bitter end to the story. Boddingtons\u2019 Strangeways brewery in the heart of Manchester closed in 2005, with the loss of 60 jobs. Now, after more than a decade as a car park, it is set for a \u00a3175m housing, retail and commercial development called Old Brewery Gardens.</p> \n<p>As for Boddingtons bitter, the one-time cream of Manchester is <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/boddingtons-bitter-end-1056793\">today brewed in south Wales</a>.</p> \n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/canal-revolution\">canal revolution series</a> looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

      "bodyText": "There is a sense of erotic anticipation. Two gondolas drift towards each other languorously. A woman and man eye each other in a knowing, sexually charged way. Ribbons on the gondoliers\u2019 hats flutter out of focus, bouquets adorn the boats. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to think you\u2019re watching an art film set in Venice,\u201d recalls director Jeff Stark. But you weren\u2019t. You were watching a beer ad filmed under leaden skies on Manchester\u2019s grimiest waterway. \u201cWe shot really tight at first so that the bridges looked Venetian \u2013 or just about.\u201d A scratchy recording of O Sole Mio completes the mood. Purists will complain that the 19th-century song was Neopolitan rather than Venetian, but that misses the point. \u201cWe used it to spoof the Cornetto ad that was popular at the time,\u201d Stark explains. In Stark\u2019s 1993 ad for Boddingtons, he cuts to an aerial shot and we see that the young man is holding something that looks like ice cream. \u201cAs the gondolas pass by each other, she leans over as if for a kiss and ... nicks his pint!\u201d The beer thief was played by Anna Chancellor. \u201cShe was a nobody at the time.\u201d She got the role after taking part in what used to be known as a \u201ccattle call\u201d: \u201cTwo minutes of audition and \u2018Next!\u2019\u201d I told Anna to drink the beer like a man and then wipe the froth from her mouth as she sat in the gondola. When she did, the lipstick smeared up her cheek. The makeup woman rushed over and said: \u2018You can\u2019t do that!\u2019 But I said: \u2018Hang on! That\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u201d And so it happened that, wide-eyed and lipstick-smeared, Chancellor uttered the immortal line: \u201cBy \u2019eck, it\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d Thanks to the help of a dialect coach, Somerset-raised, boarding school-educated Chancellor sounded more Noel Gallagher than Noel Coward. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I made Anna\u2019s career, but she did go on to star in Four Weddings and a Funeral the following year,\u201d says Stark. \u201cMore importantly, she married my B camera operator Nigel Willoughby, who she met on set when he wasn\u2019t shooting close-ups with a massive telephoto lens. So at least someone found romance.\u201d The ad ends with the spurned man heading off in his gondola. He produces a can of Boddingtons from inside his jacket and says to the camera: \u201cThat Gladys Althorpe \u2013 she never buys her own.\u201d Stark filmed the ad on the River Irwell near Granada studios. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t sunny, so we had to use lots of lights to make it look like Venice. When we pull back in the ad to reveal it\u2019s not Venice but Manchester, you see factories and smoke stacks and there\u2019s some bloke fishing and a couple walking along the towpath, one pushing a shopping trolley, which is something that you won\u2019t see in La Serenissima. Of course, Manchester\u2019s very different now.\u201d It certainly is. There is a possibility that ad agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty\u2019s Cream of Manchester ad campaign, which ran from 1991 until 1999 and is credited with revitalising the city\u2019s image, is responsible for that transformation. According to the Manchester Evening News, Stark\u2019s ad \u201ctold the world something about the reinvention of the murky old city, that its once-filthy waterway could almost pass for Venice\u201d. Since then, stretches of canal and rivers flowing through Manchester have undergone huge makeovers, with developments including Salford Quays transforming the city\u2019s waterfronts. The Irwell now is used for rowing and pleasure cruises while parts of it have become wildlife havens. As yet, though, there is no regular gondola service. But there is a bitter end to the story. Boddingtons\u2019 Strangeways brewery in the heart of Manchester closed in 2005, with the loss of 60 jobs. Now, after more than a decade as a car park, it is set for a \u00a3175m housing, retail and commercial development called Old Brewery Gardens. As for Boddingtons bitter, the one-time cream of Manchester is today brewed in south Wales. The canal revolution series looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

So we turn into Blues Avenue, then into Suraska Street. Just before the square, we can see gangs of thugs 10 metres ahead of us, attacking people: a large guy in a red balaclava is kicking everyone in sight, including some teenage girls, with the full weight of his body. Some in the crowd run away, but more of the \u201cwarriors\u201d, beefy men with angry faces, go for them.</p> <p>We take refuge in a pharmacy. The staff are horrified and there\u2019s a frightened girl of about 10 with her mother (they probably weren\u2019t going to the march). \u201cDo something, Mummy,\u201d she wails, \u201cget me out of here, I\u2019m scared.\u201d Moments later, a trembling teenage girl rushes in, with what\u2019s left of her ripped handbag hanging from her shoulder; she tries to call the friend with whom she was marching but he was attacked again and they\u2019ve lost phone contact. I try to reassure her. I do up the shoulder strap on her dungarees, and we make sure none of her things are lost, because she had to pick them up from the pavement and put them in her backpack.</p> <p>Thugs run past the windows, one of them carrying a burning rainbow flag. There are clouds of smoke. My friend M thinks they\u2019ve set fire to a car, but these are smoke bombs. When things start to calm down, we stand in the doorway and look around to see what we should do.</p> <p>After hiding behind some police cars, we reach the square. I was supposed to be making a speech at the opening, but it\u2019s out of the question \u2013 this is like a riot.

And everywhere there are hands showing the finger, lots and lots of those middle fingers, to say, \u201cFuck you, faggots\u201d. They are chanting, \u201cFags out!\u201d (to the tune of the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Go West), which is also written on their shirts.</p> <p>Altogether, there\u2019s plenty of sexual reference: sex is pouring from their mouths, throats and eyes. A skinny little guy comes running after us for just about the entire march.

Now and then, a pushier thug appears from behind the police, trying to go for someone one-to-one. It\u2019s always a guy the size of a wardrobe, wanting to take on a lad half his size, or a musclebound 40-year-old man against a 15-year-old girl with a hair bow \u2013 what fine defenders of widows and orphans. We\u2019re fully aware that, if the police weren\u2019t here, it wouldn\u2019t stop at hitting, spitting and kicking: Bia\u0142ystok has had pogroms before. And those were the work of perfectly ordinary people, too. From the start, M has been shaking badly, unable to get over the sight of that thug in the red balaclava kicking the girl \u2013 but he carries on marching. I can tell how much it\u2019s costing him, but I know he\u2019s far braver than the guys in the T-shirts with the \u201ccursed soldiers\u201d and Warsaw Uprising anchors on them (both are icons of Polish wartime suffering, sacred symbols for the nationalists). They are bold with the boldness of the herd, which is sure of its impunity as it attacks a lone victim.</p> <p>As we pass the cathedral, source of all this fury, there\u2019s a crowd on its steps. It was from here that the city\u2019s archbishop, Tadeusz Wojda, sent out his message of \u201c<em>Non possumus</em>\u201d (\u201cwe cannot [agree]\u201d for the march to go through the city) earlier in the month \u2013 we can\u2019t allow free citizens of Poland to exercise their constitutional rights. Now all these Mr Kowalskis and Mrs Bielskas, in their flowery cotton dresses, the Damians with \u201cLaw of the Wolf\u201d on their shirts and in their eyes, are standing the length of the march, running and showing the finger, spewing forth their homily of vulgarities. Wojda doesn\u2019t have to attack anyone in person. Hooligan gangs preach his gospel for him.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been standing here for so long that people ask me to get up on the platform and make the speech I was supposed to make at the start. I don\u2019t bother to get out my notes and speak off the top of my head, so it\u2019s not entirely coherent. I do my best, but I can\u2019t find the voice I\u2019d like to find \u2212 one that sounds more hopeful. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Around me everyone is disguising themselves, taking off their rainbow accessories \u2013 somehow they have to get out of here</p> <footer> <cite>Jacek Dehnel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Afterwards, I stay on the platform, because now we are moving again. From up here, with the music, the whole scene looks slightly different, and I decide to send two, three, five times more kisses and hearts to all the people showing us the finger. A girl of about 15 in the crowd glares at me angrily and, without losing eye contact, slowly draws a finger across her throat. The wheels of the platform roll over a ripped-up cobblestone that was thrown at us. A marshal extracts another from under the wheels and takes it over to the policemen to ask what he should do with it, but they just shrug. Ahead, there\u2019s another volley of bangers, and the police force a passage into the final square for us.</p> <p>So here we are, we got there, we did it despite Wojda\u2019s declaration. But we\u2019re surrounded by hatred.</p> <p>There\u2019s a drag queen on the platform and she\u2019s taking off her shoes. I wonder how long it will take to disassemble her costume. And around me everyone\u2019s doing the same. It feels agonising, possibly even worse than the sea of furious faces. Everyone is disguising themselves.</p> <p>The boy next to me tells his girlfriend to take off her glasses and gently unpeels the rings of glitter sparkling around her eyes. A girl with a cloud of gauze tries to hide it in her supermarket carrier bag but finally realises it\u2019s impossible to hide so she tosses the bag on to the platform. Everyone is taking off their rainbow accessories, folding up flags, stuffing them into black backpacks and putting on dark clothing. Somehow, they have to get out of here, and they have to go on living in this city.</p> <p>My friend J comes to fetch me and we walk to the car together, at first with a radio journalist holding a microphone \u2013 she has asked for a comment, and I give her one, because it\u2019s a bit safer like this, they probably won\u2019t beat us up in the eyes or ears of the media, that might hold them back; then we walk on, across the sunny city, one guy leaps in my direction and kicks, but wide of the mark, any old how, while screeching something, \u201cfuck off fucking faggots\u201d, but after that things are calmer. We reach the \u201cfamily picnic\u201d, with the big guns and military stuff, and he comments that the city actually made the grade, because that sort of picnic distracts people from going to attack others. I explain that in fact it\u2019s there to counteract the march and there\u2019s nothing innocent about it. He doesn\u2019t entirely believe me, until we pass two security guards standing at the entrance to the park and a telling incident occurs.</p> <p>We have just walked between the two guards when a couple of young girls appear from the opposite direction, one with a star stuck on her cheek. The guards refuse to let them through: this is the exit, not the entrance, they say. The girls ask where the entrance is and the guards reply that they won\u2019t be let in anyway, because they\u2019re from the march and people from the march aren\u2019t being admitted to the \u201cfamily picnic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHold on,\u201d says J, \u201cwe\u2019re from the march and we walked through!\u201d The guards are embarrassed, saying that\u2019s very bad, and that they won\u2019t let the girls in. \u201cBut the march is over now,\u201d says J. That\u2019s irrelevant, they say, the picnic is obviously an LGBT-free zone.</p> <p>J, who happens to be heterosexual, drove me home to Warsaw. He told me what had made the deepest impression on him. It was a woman with a toddler, aged about two or three, both of whose tiny hands she was posing to show the middle finger, while she said: \u201cThis is how you do it!\u201d And then she chanted: \u201cFuck-off-fag-gots! Fuck-off-fag-gots!\u201d</p> <p><em>Jacek Dehnel is a novelist, poet and columnist who speaks publicly on issues affecting Poland\u2019s LGBT community.

Opponents of the march spat, swore, and hurled abuse - in between invocations of fealty to God and the fatherland.</p> <p>Two days after the march, Tadeusz Wojda, archbishop of Bia\u0142ystok, condemned the violence as \u201cincompatible with the attitude of a Christian\u201d, his brief statement leading swiftly on to an appeal for people to pray \u201cfor the family and its internal purity\u201d.</p> <p>Far-right thugs have been a presence on Polish streets since the early 1990s. What has changed in recent years is that the government itself now routinely makes statements that would make the average God-fearing hooligan blush. Ahead of the 2015 elections that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/poland-lurches-to-right-with-election-of-law-and-justice-party\" title=\"\">brought the ruling right</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/poland-lurches-to-right-with-election-of-law-and-justice-party\" title=\"\">wing Law and Justice party (PiS) to power</a> \u2013 and which were held at the peak of the European migration crisis \u2013 the PiS, ), then in opposition, portrayed Muslim migrants as the great existential threat to the nation.

These are not internal Polish mechanisms,\u201d PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski told a party gathering ahead of the recent European elections. \u201cThey are a threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, however, what Kaczy\u0144ski and the thugs on the streets of Bia\u0142ystok are all expressing is a sense of impotent rage that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/30/poland-democratic-spring-fightback-citizens\" title=\"\">Polish society as a whole is moving away from them</a>. This was the first equality march in Bia\u0142ystok \u2013 just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable for many that such an event could be held at all. For Wojda, who decried it as \u201can initiative alien to our land and society\u201d, it clearly still is.</p> <p>But the church\u2019s authority is collapsing, leaving nationalists and conservatives terrified that their country will go the way of Ireland and adopt a \u201cnew morality\u201d rooted in the language of diversity and human rights.

      "bodyText": "We set off from the Arsenal gallery in a small group of about 20 people, first through Bia\u0142ystok\u2019s Branicki Palace gardens, where a \u201cfamily picnic\u201d is in full swing, organised by the Law and Justice party local authorities as a contrast to the Pride march. There are bouncy castles, but what there\u2019s most of is military stuff, border guards, some big guns and armoured personnel carriers \u2212 it\u2019s a family event, for the kiddies, so let\u2019s have plenty of militarism. We continue along Sk\u0142odowska Street towards the square from where the march is meant to start, but some people are running away from there and heading down another street, because marchers are being hit. So we turn into Blues Avenue, then into Suraska Street. Just before the square, we can see gangs of thugs 10 metres ahead of us, attacking people: a large guy in a red balaclava is kicking everyone in sight, including some teenage girls, with the full weight of his body. Some in the crowd run away, but more of the \u201cwarriors\u201d, beefy men with angry faces, go for them. We take refuge in a pharmacy. The staff are horrified and there\u2019s a frightened girl of about 10 with her mother (they probably weren\u2019t going to the march). \u201cDo something, Mummy,\u201d she wails, \u201cget me out of here, I\u2019m scared.\u201d Moments later, a trembling teenage girl rushes in, with what\u2019s left of her ripped handbag hanging from her shoulder; she tries to call the friend with whom she was marching but he was attacked again and they\u2019ve lost phone contact. I try to reassure her. I do up the shoulder strap on her dungarees, and we make sure none of her things are lost, because she had to pick them up from the pavement and put them in her backpack. Thugs run past the windows, one of them carrying a burning rainbow flag. There are clouds of smoke. My friend M thinks they\u2019ve set fire to a car, but these are smoke bombs. When things start to calm down, we stand in the doorway and look around to see what we should do. After hiding behind some police cars, we reach the square. I was supposed to be making a speech at the opening, but it\u2019s out of the question \u2013 this is like a riot. Beneath a monument on the far side of the square there are hooligans, with flags, and in the centre there\u2019s the rather inconspicuous parade with its rainbow flags. There\u2019s a stink of rotten eggs and lots of abusive shouting. The police cordon isn\u2019t \u201ctight\u201d, as the press later reported \u2013 there are big gaps near us, so now and then hoodlums lunge at the marchers, ripping their placards to pieces and threatening to beat them up. Most of all, they bellow insult after insult, some in gangs, others individually, some with their own crazy monologues. And everywhere there are hands showing the finger, lots and lots of those middle fingers, to say, \u201cFuck you, faggots\u201d. They are chanting, \u201cFags out!\u201d (to the tune of the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Go West), which is also written on their shirts. Altogether, there\u2019s plenty of sexual reference: sex is pouring from their mouths, throats and eyes. A skinny little guy comes running after us for just about the entire march. He\u2019ll be with us for a good hour and a half; now and then, his nice, tanned face will loom up, distorted with rage, but plainly with fascination, too. There are almost only men here. Sometimes one holds a woman by the hand, but this is a men\u2019s club: hooligans old and young; some in neo-fascist attire, others like typical uncles or grandads, holding shopping bags, with sagging cheeks and comb-overs; work-worn blokes in down-at-heel shoes, sweat stains under their arms. These are ordinary, thoroughly ordinary people: nice Mr Kowalski from the allotments, Mr Nowak who goes to the local shop, Mr Wolski from No 6. But with masks instead of their usual faces, which are altered in a nightmarish way, their eyes full of blood, their voices raucous, yelling, \u201cfuck, arse, faggots\u201d. The fact that those rosaries, those crosses, those icons of Jesus they\u2019re holding up are soiled with filth, interlaced with the ugliest words of all, with linguistic excrement, is an act of blasphemy no Polish bishop will ever condemn. There are bottles flying. The whole way, we march amid the stench of rotten eggs; the cobbles are covered in yellow gunk. We pass a girl of about 20, with very fine features.She stops and takes a break, facing away from the front of the march; she has a huge, bleeding lump on her forehead, the size of a plum; her brother strokes her arm and, with a smile, she says something about how everyone\u2019s looking, so she combs her hair the other way with her fingers to cover up the mark. There\u2019s non-stop whistling, and bangers exploding. There\u2019s also non-stop chanting: \u201cFuck-off-out-of-it! But the Pride march gathers strength; we start chanting too, drowning out their shrieks. We pass a guy with a beer belly bulging from under his T-shirt like risen dough from a bread tin; he\u2019s wielding a snapped-off pedal (in Polish, peda\u0142 means a bike pedal, but also \u201cfaggot\u201d), twirling it with abandon. He\u2019s like a sozzled uncle at a wedding who thinks he\u2019s a great comedian. \u201cYour-bike\u2019s-bust-ed! \u201d we chant at him, but he\u2019s inordinately pleased with himself. Now and then, a lorry drives along the march with a megaphone, spitting out Catholic propaganda about how gays and lesbians rape children by the dozen. But finally our own truck playing music drives up, too. Crude insults are hurled by a guy with black hair, wearing a T-shirt inscribed \u201cArmy of God\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of Jesus\u201d (but what if Jesus is ashamed of you, I wonder).

From the start, M has been shaking badly, unable to get over the sight of that thug in the red balaclava kicking the girl \u2013 but he carries on marching. I can tell how much it\u2019s costing him, but I know he\u2019s far braver than the guys in the T-shirts with the \u201ccursed soldiers\u201d and Warsaw Uprising anchors on them (both are icons of Polish wartime suffering, sacred symbols for the nationalists). They are bold with the boldness of the herd, which is sure of its impunity as it attacks a lone victim. As we pass the cathedral, source of all this fury, there\u2019s a crowd on its steps. It was from here that the city\u2019s archbishop, Tadeusz Wojda, sent out his message of \u201cNon possumus\u201d (\u201cwe cannot [agree]\u201d for the march to go through the city) earlier in the month \u2013 we can\u2019t allow free citizens of Poland to exercise their constitutional rights. Now all these Mr Kowalskis and Mrs Bielskas, in their flowery cotton dresses, the Damians with \u201cLaw of the Wolf\u201d on their shirts and in their eyes, are standing the length of the march, running and showing the finger, spewing forth their homily of vulgarities. Wojda doesn\u2019t have to attack anyone in person. Hooligan gangs preach his gospel for him. We\u2019ve been standing here for so long that people ask me to get up on the platform and make the speech I was supposed to make at the start. I don\u2019t bother to get out my notes and speak off the top of my head, so it\u2019s not entirely coherent. I do my best, but I can\u2019t find the voice I\u2019d like to find \u2212 one that sounds more hopeful. Afterwards, I stay on the platform, because now we are moving again. From up here, with the music, the whole scene looks slightly different, and I decide to send two, three, five times more kisses and hearts to all the people showing us the finger. A girl of about 15 in the crowd glares at me angrily and, without losing eye contact, slowly draws a finger across her throat. The wheels of the platform roll over a ripped-up cobblestone that was thrown at us. A marshal extracts another from under the wheels and takes it over to the policemen to ask what he should do with it, but they just shrug. Ahead, there\u2019s another volley of bangers, and the police force a passage into the final square for us. So here we are, we got there, we did it despite Wojda\u2019s declaration. But we\u2019re surrounded by hatred. There\u2019s a drag queen on the platform and she\u2019s taking off her shoes. I wonder how long it will take to disassemble her costume. And around me everyone\u2019s doing the same. It feels agonising, possibly even worse than the sea of furious faces. Everyone is disguising themselves. The boy next to me tells his girlfriend to take off her glasses and gently unpeels the rings of glitter sparkling around her eyes. A girl with a cloud of gauze tries to hide it in her supermarket carrier bag but finally realises it\u2019s impossible to hide so she tosses the bag on to the platform. Everyone is taking off their rainbow accessories, folding up flags, stuffing them into black backpacks and putting on dark clothing. Somehow, they have to get out of here, and they have to go on living in this city. My friend J comes to fetch me and we walk to the car together, at first with a radio journalist holding a microphone \u2013 she has asked for a comment, and I give her one, because it\u2019s a bit safer like this, they probably won\u2019t beat us up in the eyes or ears of the media, that might hold them back; then we walk on, across the sunny city, one guy leaps in my direction and kicks, but wide of the mark, any old how, while screeching something, \u201cfuck off fucking faggots\u201d, but after that things are calmer. We reach the \u201cfamily picnic\u201d, with the big guns and military stuff, and he comments that the city actually made the grade, because that sort of picnic distracts people from going to attack others. I explain that in fact it\u2019s there to counteract the march and there\u2019s nothing innocent about it. He doesn\u2019t entirely believe me, until we pass two security guards standing at the entrance to the park and a telling incident occurs. We have just walked between the two guards when a couple of young girls appear from the opposite direction, one with a star stuck on her cheek. The guards refuse to let them through: this is the exit, not the entrance, they say. The girls ask where the entrance is and the guards reply that they won\u2019t be let in anyway, because they\u2019re from the march and people from the march aren\u2019t being admitted to the \u201cfamily picnic\u201d. \u201cHold on,\u201d says J, \u201cwe\u2019re from the march and we walked through!\u201d The guards are embarrassed, saying that\u2019s very bad, and that they won\u2019t let the girls in. \u201cBut the march is over now,\u201d says J. That\u2019s irrelevant, they say, the picnic is obviously an LGBT-free zone. J, who happens to be heterosexual, drove me home to Warsaw. He told me what had made the deepest impression on him. It was a woman with a toddler, aged about two or three, both of whose tiny hands she was posing to show the middle finger, while she said: \u201cThis is how you do it!\u201d And then she chanted: \u201cFuck-off-fag-gots! Fuck-off-fag-gots!\u201d Jacek Dehnel is a novelist, poet and columnist who speaks publicly on issues affecting Poland\u2019s LGBT community. In 2018 he married his long-term partner in London, as same-sex marriage is not legally recognised in Poland. Antonia Lloyd-Jones translated Why Poland\u2019s ruling party is demonising \u2018LGBT ideology\u2019 The brutal attack on last weekend\u2019s equality march in the city of Bia\u0142ystok, in north-eastern Poland, occurred amid a government campaign to whip up homophobic feeling and fear of so-called \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d. Twenty-five people were detained by police after the attack on the march, during which far-right nationalist hooligans threw bottles, fireworks, rocks, rotten eggs and punches at participants. Opponents of the march spat, swore, and hurled abuse - in between invocations of fealty to God and the fatherland. Two days after the march, Tadeusz Wojda, archbishop of Bia\u0142ystok, condemned the violence as \u201cincompatible with the attitude of a Christian\u201d, his brief statement leading swiftly on to an appeal for people to pray \u201cfor the family and its internal purity\u201d. Far-right thugs have been a presence on Polish streets since the early 1990s. What has changed in recent years is that the government itself now routinely makes statements that would make the average God-fearing hooligan blush. Ahead of the 2015 elections that brought the ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) to power \u2013 and which were held at the peak of the European migration crisis \u2013 the PiS, ), then in opposition, portrayed Muslim migrants as the great existential threat to the nation. Now, with key parliamentary elections due in the autumn, gay rights are being constituted as the new invasion. \u201cThese ideologies, philosophies, all of this is imported. These are not internal Polish mechanisms,\u201d PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski told a party gathering ahead of the recent European elections. \u201cThey are a threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence.\u201d In many ways, however, what Kaczy\u0144ski and the thugs on the streets of Bia\u0142ystok are all expressing is a sense of impotent rage that Polish society as a whole is moving away from them. This was the first equality march in Bia\u0142ystok \u2013 just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable for many that such an event could be held at all. For Wojda, who decried it as \u201can initiative alien to our land and society\u201d, it clearly still is. But the church\u2019s authority is collapsing, leaving nationalists and conservatives terrified that their country will go the way of Ireland and adopt a \u201cnew morality\u201d rooted in the language of diversity and human rights. The fear is well-founded. On Saturday in Warsaw more than 1,000 gathered in support of gay rights after the violence in Bialystok. Amelia Rae, 15, said: \u201cIf anything is going to change then the government needs to change.\u201d Christian Davies",

He has his regular venues and can call on his favourite musicians wherever he goes. In this case it\u2019s Hans Backenroth on bass, Kristian Leth, drums, and the phenomenal pianist Jan Lundgren. The same team made a splendid album of Swedish tunes a few years ago.

There\u2019s Dansevise, Denmark\u2019s entry in the 1963 Eurovision song contest, which comes out as a swinging jazz waltz, and the folk song whose title translates as In the Still of the Woods, reputed to have words by Hans Christian Andersen. It makes a beautiful slow ballad. I\u2019ve rarely heard Hamilton play better. His style is often described as \u201ctimeless\u201d, being full of echoes and memories of past masters, yet it is always fresh, alert and unmistakably his own.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A selection of Danish folk tunes, movie themes, cabaret songs and jazz numbers, played by a truly great tenor saxophonist. Scott Hamilton has been based in Europe (first London, now Florence) for around 20 years. He has his regular venues and can call on his favourite musicians wherever he goes. In this case it\u2019s Hans Backenroth on bass, Kristian Leth, drums, and the phenomenal pianist Jan Lundgren. The same team made a splendid album of Swedish tunes a few years ago. I\u2019ve just played them both and think this is perhaps slightly better. They\u2019ve come up with some really interesting and attractive pieces \u2013 not the obvious ones either. There\u2019s Dansevise, Denmark\u2019s entry in the 1963 Eurovision song contest, which comes out as a swinging jazz waltz, and the folk song whose title translates as In the Still of the Woods, reputed to have words by Hans Christian Andersen. It makes a beautiful slow ballad. I\u2019ve rarely heard Hamilton play better. His style is often described as \u201ctimeless\u201d, being full of echoes and memories of past masters, yet it is always fresh, alert and unmistakably his own.",

Trevor Nunn\u2019s brilliant and involving production does both. I had to pinch myself to check that I was, against expectation, enjoying myself inordinately, and to accept that even the songs with the lamest lyrics were turning out to be no obstacle to a great night out (handkerchiefs are required).</p> <p>This is the story of a middle-aged Italian immigrant, Francesca, who lives in Iowa and is married to a former American soldier, now a farmer.

      "bodyText": "Based on Robert James Waller\u2019s bestselling novel The Bridges of Madison County, Jason Robert Brown\u2019s musical, which had a short run on Broadway in 2014, needed either to rise above sentimentality or to embrace it unashamedly. Trevor Nunn\u2019s brilliant and involving production does both. I had to pinch myself to check that I was, against expectation, enjoying myself inordinately, and to accept that even the songs with the lamest lyrics were turning out to be no obstacle to a great night out (handkerchiefs are required). This is the story of a middle-aged Italian immigrant, Francesca, who lives in Iowa and is married to a former American soldier, now a farmer. Francesca is outstandingly played by Jenna Russell, who makes you sympathise with each lilting Italian syllable that she says and sings (the show is uneven musically, but there\u2019s a touch of Joni Mitchell to its best numbers). When Francesca\u2019s husband and children go off to a county fair without her, she looks forward to lie-ins and iced tea and studying seed catalogues. She is not, you would think, the sort of woman to stray. But when Robert Kincaid, a photographer on an assignment to photograph the bridges of Madison county for the National Geographic (played in the 1995 film version by Clint Eastwood opposite Meryl Streep), drops by asking for directions, it turns out to be the heart\u2019s directions that count. Robert is a free spirit (and, like most free spirits, essentially trapped). Edward Baker-Duly steps into Eastwood\u2019s shoes effortlessly \u2013 he even looks a bit like him. He lopes about with casual ease, more cowboy than cameraman, sings with a fine tenor voice, and a romance is cooked up along with the vegetable soup they prepare together. It\u2019s cosily improbable but who cares? The fennel now chopped, we are idling towards a moral climax: should Francesca throw away family life for new love? Her trusting husband is nicely played by Dale Rapley, and there are decent performances as their feistily self-involved children from Maddison Bulleyment and David Perkins, and enjoyable stretches in which bickering family talk turns into song. Add in starry singers Shanay Holmes and Gillian Kirkpatrick and the recipe is complete. Holmes is bewitching as Kincaid\u2019s young ex-wife (haunting an early scene), and the way Kirkpatrick switches from spying neighbour to siren singer is theatrical gold \u2013 Nunn at his innovative best. Jon Bausor\u2019s wonderful set creates huge spaces within the Menier\u2019s confines, starting with screened projections of the sea that Francesca crossed to get to Iowa which turn into blurred prairie: \u201c300 acres waiting to be tamed\u201d. In a week of heatwave and American musicals, crossing from Iowa to Oklahoma! was a seamless transition. It is one of the strengths of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s 1943 musical that, in spite of its greatest hit, Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin\u2019, beautiful days are not equally beautiful for everyone. In Jeremy Sams\u2019s exuberant and sensitive production, Jud Fry\u2019s death tarnishes Curly and Laurey\u2019s wedding day and Aunt Eller\u2019s motto \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be hardy\u201d \u2013 rings true.

      "body": "<p>Fishing floats, bottle stoppers, platform soles, pinboards, coasters. The uses of cork are many and varied, but it still retains a whiff of 1970s suburbia, like avocado bathroom suites or jumbo corduroy. Yet in its way, cork is a wonder material \u2013 strong in compression (those platform soles), water-resistant and a good source of insulation. Cork is also impeccably sustainable. Bark from <em>Quercus suber</em>, the cork oak, is carefully stripped by hand every nine to 12 years, leaving the tree intact, unlike felling for timber. Portugal and Spain are responsible for 80% of cork production, with much of it still going to make corks for wine bottles, despite the rise of the screw top.</p> <p>As for cork in architecture \u2013 or \u201ccorkitecture\u201d \u2013 the picture is more patchy. Cork has been a minor supporting player, used for flooring and wall tiles, or as an early form of insulation, sandwiched in walls. It has made the odd breakout appearance as cladding for temporary structures, such as \u00c1lvaro Siza and Eduardo Souto de Moura\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.apcor.pt/en/portfolio-posts/portugal-pavilion-at-expo-2000-hannover/\" title=\"\">Portugal pavilion</a> at Expo 2000 in Hanover, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/may/31/serpentine-gallery-pavilion-pictures\" title=\"\">2012 Serpentine Gallery pavilion</a> by the Swiss partnership of Herzog &amp; De Meuron in collaboration with artist Ai Weiwei.

Cork House is just that: a house constructed from solid blocks of expanded cork, like gingerbread or vegan Lego. \u201cIt\u2019s purely plant-based, a waste product and from a biodiverse landscape,\u201d says Milne. \u201cIts potential as a building material interested us.\u201d This sparked a six-year research project, conducted with the support of engineers Arup and UCL\u2019s Bartlett School of Architecture, among others. It\u2019s a familiar scenario, architects designing and building for themselves, but the scope and scale of the research programme elevates Cork House beyond the realms of the vanity project, enabling it to punch above its weight as a didactic prototype, despite being the smallest scheme on the six-strong Stirling shortlist.</p> <p>With huge variations in the scale and type of projects \u2013 this year\u2019s contenders include an opera house, a distillery, social housing and London Bridge station \u2013 judging the Stirling prize is like trying to choose between a cookery book and a science fiction novel. If Cork House were a book, it would be a manifesto or polemical tract that aimed to radically reframe the processes of architecture and construction through the prism of whole life sustainability, from design to demolition. Buildings account for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions and are rapacious consumers of resources and energy, yet too often sustainability is seen by architects and clients as just another box to tick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"772a090cdab942c29a3be0d068ca4ac1e25a0199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/772a090cdab942c29a3be0d068ca4ac1e25a0199/0_0_3666_4242/864.jpg\" alt=\"Cork House interior\" width=\"864\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cork House\u2019s \u2018womblike\u2019 interior, and walls that are \u2018slightly spongy to the touch\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magnus Dennis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cork House turns the conventional design process on its head. \u201cWe were interested to see what kind of architecture would develop if we worked from environmentally sustainable first principles and considered each stage of the life cycle,\u201d says Wilton. Made from reconstituted waste cork, which was then shaped and carved by robots, the solid cork blocks create and define the architectural language. Self-consciously \u201ceco-friendly\u201d buildings can often be visually undistinguished, but the strong, simple volume of Cork House, with its rye bread-textured walls, has a curious beauty and rigour.</p> <p>The project is set in a bucolic riverside enclave overlooked by the Mordor-esque silhouette of Eton College. Eton\u2019s high street oozes oleaginous quaintness, so is, on the face of it, not a predictable setting for an experiment in modernity and ecology. Nonetheless, something radical is going on in the shrubbery. Emerging from its garden site, the house is a long, low-slung pavilion, crowned by a quintet of beehive-like structures. Each is inset with a glazed oculus that anchors the roof like a paperweight, while funnelling light down into the interior. Slotted together without any mortar or glue, like drystone walling, their hefty, stepped forms call to mind ancient Mayan or Mesopotamian structures of stacked stone. Inside, the atmosphere is dark and womblike, shot through with the fugitive gleam of burnished copper and brass used for fixtures and fittings. Soft and slightly spongy to the touch, the cork walls are a reminder of the house\u2019s organic origins and a rebuttal to the brittle sterility and effortful minimalism of so many contemporary domestic interiors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30ea801c7a16fab4c735609f720cf7f498a78804\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ea801c7a16fab4c735609f720cf7f498a78804/0_0_4403_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cork House, Eton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cork House, Eton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricky Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/18/stirling-prize-2019-riba-shortlist-cork-building-social-housing\">Stirling prize 2019 shortlist: from a cork creation to a Teletubbies-style whisky distillery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because of the risk of flooding, the building is slightly elevated above the ground, impinging very lightly on the site.

      "bodyText": "Fishing floats, bottle stoppers, platform soles, pinboards, coasters. The uses of cork are many and varied, but it still retains a whiff of 1970s suburbia, like avocado bathroom suites or jumbo corduroy. Yet in its way, cork is a wonder material \u2013 strong in compression (those platform soles), water-resistant and a good source of insulation. Cork is also impeccably sustainable. Bark from Quercus suber, the cork oak, is carefully stripped by hand every nine to 12 years, leaving the tree intact, unlike felling for timber. Portugal and Spain are responsible for 80% of cork production, with much of it still going to make corks for wine bottles, despite the rise of the screw top. As for cork in architecture \u2013 or \u201ccorkitecture\u201d \u2013 the picture is more patchy. Cork has been a minor supporting player, used for flooring and wall tiles, or as an early form of insulation, sandwiched in walls. It has made the odd breakout appearance as cladding for temporary structures, such as \u00c1lvaro Siza and Eduardo Souto de Moura\u2019s Portugal pavilion at Expo 2000 in Hanover, and the 2012 Serpentine Gallery pavilion by the Swiss partnership of Herzog &amp; De Meuron in collaboration with artist Ai Weiwei. More recently, the Redshank House, a weekend bolthole on the Essex coast designed by architect Lisa Shell and sculptor Marcus Taylor, came wrapped in a warm, spongiform skin of Portuguese cork. Shortlisted for the 2019 Stirling prize, the annual award for the best building in Britain, Cork House by Matthew Barnett Howland, Dido Milne and Oliver Wilton takes corkitecture to another level by employing it as a total building material. Cork House is just that: a house constructed from solid blocks of expanded cork, like gingerbread or vegan Lego. \u201cIt\u2019s purely plant-based, a waste product and from a biodiverse landscape,\u201d says Milne. \u201cIts potential as a building material interested us.\u201d This sparked a six-year research project, conducted with the support of engineers Arup and UCL\u2019s Bartlett School of Architecture, among others. It\u2019s a familiar scenario, architects designing and building for themselves, but the scope and scale of the research programme elevates Cork House beyond the realms of the vanity project, enabling it to punch above its weight as a didactic prototype, despite being the smallest scheme on the six-strong Stirling shortlist. With huge variations in the scale and type of projects \u2013 this year\u2019s contenders include an opera house, a distillery, social housing and London Bridge station \u2013 judging the Stirling prize is like trying to choose between a cookery book and a science fiction novel. If Cork House were a book, it would be a manifesto or polemical tract that aimed to radically reframe the processes of architecture and construction through the prism of whole life sustainability, from design to demolition. Buildings account for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions and are rapacious consumers of resources and energy, yet too often sustainability is seen by architects and clients as just another box to tick. Cork House turns the conventional design process on its head. \u201cWe were interested to see what kind of architecture would develop if we worked from environmentally sustainable first principles and considered each stage of the life cycle,\u201d says Wilton. Made from reconstituted waste cork, which was then shaped and carved by robots, the solid cork blocks create and define the architectural language. Self-consciously \u201ceco-friendly\u201d buildings can often be visually undistinguished, but the strong, simple volume of Cork House, with its rye bread-textured walls, has a curious beauty and rigour. The project is set in a bucolic riverside enclave overlooked by the Mordor-esque silhouette of Eton College. Eton\u2019s high street oozes oleaginous quaintness, so is, on the face of it, not a predictable setting for an experiment in modernity and ecology. Nonetheless, something radical is going on in the shrubbery. Emerging from its garden site, the house is a long, low-slung pavilion, crowned by a quintet of beehive-like structures. Each is inset with a glazed oculus that anchors the roof like a paperweight, while funnelling light down into the interior. Slotted together without any mortar or glue, like drystone walling, their hefty, stepped forms call to mind ancient Mayan or Mesopotamian structures of stacked stone. Inside, the atmosphere is dark and womblike, shot through with the fugitive gleam of burnished copper and brass used for fixtures and fittings. Soft and slightly spongy to the touch, the cork walls are a reminder of the house\u2019s organic origins and a rebuttal to the brittle sterility and effortful minimalism of so many contemporary domestic interiors. Because of the risk of flooding, the building is slightly elevated above the ground, impinging very lightly on the site. It\u2019s tempting to think that it could just float away as the waters rise, like a modern ark, but when its time does come the house can be dismantled with minimal environmental impact. As a bio-renewable resource, the cork blocks can either be recycled or broken down and returned to the earth. The aim is to leave no trace. \u201cIt\u2019s a provocation, to some extent,\u201d declares Barnett Howland. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that cork is the answer to the construction industry\u2019s problems, but it does point up the need to think about a whole-life approach to buildings.\u201d Achieving this will not only require a paradigm shift in how buildings are commissioned, designed and made, but also a more profound reconceptualisation of the role of architecture and its relationship with society. Yet in bringing these issues into sharper relief, Cork House shows what might be possible, illustrating the increasingly critical importance of substance as well as style.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI only had a minute.\u201d Jane Bown, the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s greatest postwar photographer, used to tell the story of the day she was sent to the Royal Court theatre to photograph Samuel Beckett, acclaimed author of <em>Waiting For Godot</em>. Bown was renowned for snatching photographs against the odds, but the shy, unsmiling, and nervously intense figure of Beckett, compared by one friend to an \u201cAztec eagle\u201d, presented a rare challenge. \u201cYou can have a minute,\u201d he announced, fiercely asserting the superiority of drama to journalism.</p> <p>He was tall and remote; she was short but dauntless. In the half-lit alleyway outside the stage door, Bown positioned her reluctant celebrity against the wall, and fired off barely a dozen shots, later remembering the arctic blue intensity of Beckett\u2019s eyes. After the prescribed minute of photographic concentration, she packed up her Leica, thanked him for his time, and fled, hoping that she\u2019d got a usable frame. This is a story I heard from Jane Bown herself on a number of occasions. In the making of the radio programme on which this article is based, every other quotation either comes from the Beckett Foundation or was specially recorded for the BBC.</p> <p>Sometimes, art and adversity click. When you examine the contact sheet today, all Bown\u2019s frames are in focus, but there\u2019s one that seems to capture her elusive subject perfectly, the face of the writer famous for \u201cEver tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a36157c980d831bfd6007d5bc3291663ed7caea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a36157c980d831bfd6007d5bc3291663ed7caea9/0_0_7500_1591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Bown\u2019s contact strip containing her celebrated portrait of Samuel Beckett leaving the Royal Court theatre, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"212\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Bown\u2019s contact strip containing her celebrated portrait of Samuel Beckett leaving the Royal Court theatre, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is a picture worth a thousand words? From that awkward and fleeting encounter Bown created, by chance, an indelible portrait of the inscrutable artist confronting the torments of existence. For my generation, this became the icon of \u201cBeckettian\u201d, the adjective that conjures the solitary artist, part seer, part hermit: ascetic, angular, and reclusive.</p> <p>Writers often have three lives \u2013 public, private, and secret \u2013 and Bown\u2019s photo, brilliant as it is, turns out to be slightly misleading. The shy, public Beckett of <em>Godot</em> was also the convivial writer cherished by a devoted circle of actors and friends in Dublin, Paris and London as Sam. The occluded \u201cSam\u201d represents the complex private side of Samuel Barclay Beckett, an Irishman born in Dublin on Good Friday, 1906. His family, like Oscar Wilde\u2019s, were middle-class Irish Protestants. As a young man, Sam was an excellent cricketer whose \u201cgritty\u201d batting appears in Wisden. Having studied at Trinity College, Dublin, he exiled himself, via London, to Paris. In the footsteps of James Joyce, it was his ambition to join the European avant garde.</p> <p>Between the wars, he sat at Joyce\u2019s feet during the torturous gestation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations\" title=\"\"><em>Finnegans Wake</em></a> and developed his own gifts as a writer in the shadow of modernism. His first novel, <em>Murphy</em>, rejected many times, was finally published in 1938. Opening with a brilliantly alienated first line \u2013 \u201cThe sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\u201d \u2013 <em>Murphy </em>puzzled a lot of reviewers, was praised by Dylan Thomas, and sold badly.</p> <p>Then the war came, and the Nazi Panzers rolled into Paris. Beckett joined a Resistance cell, which was betrayed by a priest, fled south to unoccupied France, and lived for much of the war as a near vagrant and Resistance foot soldier in and around Roussillon in the Vaucluse. Returning to Paris after the liberation in 1944, he embarked on \u201cthe siege in the room\u201d, completing his trio of novels (<em>Molloy</em>, <em>Malone Dies</em>, <em>The Unnamable</em>) to establish a cult reputation as a writer\u2019s writer, an avant gardist with a quirky wit. Possibly it was his experience of war and resistance that inspired<em> En Attendant Godot</em>. As he began to pick up the threads of his prewar life in Paris, it was this vision of existence \u2013 boredom, and waiting seasoned with a gallows humour \u2013 that he expressed in radical dramatic form.</p> <p>Being the author of <em>Godot</em>, Beckett was certainly a member of the avant garde, but an unlikely theatrical innovator. As a writer uniquely troubled by man\u2019s fate, Beckett\u2019s earliest dramatic fragments had been experimental disappointments. Now, to break free from the oppressive influence of modernism, he wrote in French. After many vicissitudes, his \u201ctragicomedy in two acts\u201d received its premiere in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Babylone, on 5 January 1953. There\u2019s a common view that it flopped. Actually, produced on a shoestring, it did quite well, with some favourable reviews. When the script of <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, in Beckett\u2019s English translation, crossed the Channel it landed on the desk of a young director, Peter Hall, who, admitting that he hadn\u2019t \u201cthe foggiest idea\u201d what it meant, produced it at the Arts theatre, London in August 1955.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d330db851177370baf42c23af586027ffca9a669\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d330db851177370baf42c23af586027ffca9a669/0_172_2304_2880/800.jpg\" alt=\"Beckett at rehearsals for Waiting for Godot at the Royal Court in the 1980s.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beckett at rehearsals for Waiting for Godot at the Royal Court in the 1980s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Cooper/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking to the BBC in 1994, Hall recalled a \u201clyrical masterpiece\u201d, describing it as \u201ca great tragic play about living: what is it like to be alive, waiting for death\u2026? I also thought it was very funny, so I decided I\u2019d have a go.\u201d</p> <p>Godot had already provoked sarcastic hostility as the play in which \u201cnothing happens, twice\u201d, but Hall\u2019s production was a hit with the two most influential London critics, Ken Tynan (the <em>Observer</em>) and Harold Hobson (the <em>Sunday Times</em>), who both hailed this existential comedy as a masterpiece.</p> <p>It was also a theatrical revolution. From the moment Vladimir and Estragon step onto an empty stage with \u201cNothing to be done\u201d the audience is pitched into a strangely entertaining world in which the idea of boredom becomes a prolonged metaphor for the nature of existence, sustained by two tramps in vaudeville costume, trapped in exhilarating cross-talk, killing time in anticipation of \u201cMr Godot\u201d.Once Beckett had discovered his vocation, the plays that followed <em>Godot </em>(<em>Endgame</em>, <em>Krapp\u2019s Last Tape</em> and <em>Happy Days</em>) saw the myth of \u201cBeckett\u201d eclipse the identity of \u201cSam\u201d. In 1965, when he wrote<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdWxml9BwgA\" title=\"\"> <em>Eh Joe</em></a>, his first play for television, starring Jack MacGowran, he rehearsed a young leading lady from the West End named Si\u00e2n Phillips, then married to Peter O\u2019Toole. She was to play the Voice, a viperish whisper in Joe\u2019s ear.</p> <p>Phillips, who had seen <em>Godot</em> as a student, had no idea what to expect, and turned up for rehearsals \u201cprobably sporting a bit of Dior to boost my confidence\u201d, hot from the West End. \u201cI had a marvellous hairdo,\u201d she remembers, \u201cand a little hat.\u201d Then Beckett arrived. \u201cThis vision came in. He was so beautifully dressed with the most exquisite sweater I\u2019d ever seen \u2013 a silk polo-neck I think \u2013 with the softest cashmere jacket. He had these wonderful blue eyes (like O\u2019Toole). There\u2019s a picture taken of us at that moment. I look like a frightened rabbit. He looks like a beautiful bird of prey, incredibly handsome, a merciless god. I knew I was in the presence of a great man.\u201d</p> <p>Quite soon, Phillips discovered that while \u201cworking with Sam was one of the best things that ever happened to me\u201d, it was also \u201cthe most exhausting thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d She smiles at the memory. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anything like it. He was nothing but courteous, and he wasn\u2019t a bully, but he wanted to get it done his way, which was \u2018the only way\u2019.\u201d This, she discovered, was to treat the text like music. She imitates the beat. \u201cHe metronomed it for me.\u201d</p> <p>Some years later, Phillips encountered another version of Beckett\u2019s private side. She recalls that O\u2019Toole wanted to make a film of <em>Godot</em>, but \u201cSam wouldn\u2019t allow it\u201d. When the two men quarrelled at a dinner in Manchester Square in London, Phillips witnessed Beckett\u2019s artistic intransigence at first hand. \u201cHe said <em>Godot</em> would never be filmed, the only actor he cared about in movies was Buster Keaton, a film could not equal the theatre. It went on and on, very convivial, but quite aggressive. They seemed to become more Irish the more they drank.\u201d</p> <p>Beckett was often in London in the mid-60s, but was also at home in Paris with a circle of artistic friends that included the French-Israeli painter Avigdor Arikha whose eldest child, Alba, was Beckett\u2019s goddaughter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/majorminor-by-alba-arikha-review-a-teenagers-memoir-of-turbulent-times\" title=\"\">Alba, now a novelist</a>, was just a child, but she remembers \u201cblue eyes like the sea\u201d. As a small girl, she remembers \u201csomebody very tall picking me up.

His silences mattered as much as his words. He had an aura, but he was easy to talk to. We used to play Mozart and Schubert together, a very intimate experience. He came for dinner once a month, would recite poetry \u2013 a Shakespeare sonnet, Keats\u2019s Ode to a Nightingale<em> </em>\u2013 and listen to classical music.\u201d</p> <p>Beckett\u2019s visits to the Avigdor household were partly an escape from his fame. \u201cHe was a solitary man,\u201d says Arikha. \u201cPeople used to pester him, and he did not like celebrity.\u201d As \u201cSam\u201d, she says, he nurtured a circle of \u201cabout five close friends\u201d. These included stage designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/08/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\" title=\"\">Jocelyn Herbert</a>, literary critic AJ \u201cCon\u201d Leventhal, actors Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Magee and Jack MacGowran, director Alan Schneider, and the translator Barbara Bray. <br>In his prime (from 1950 to 1969), Beckett was peripatetic: flitting from Paris or Berlin to New York, Ireland and London. In the late 60s, Jack MacGowran\u2019s friendship with a young journalist from Bristol named Tom Stoppard led to a tantalising non-encounter at a party in Portland Place, near the BBC. Stoppard confides: \u201cI was at that time in a strange state of [Beckett] worship, and it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that you could actually meet him. To me, he was a kind of spiritual presence. So I was incapacitated. I was at this party, feeling like a yokel from Bristol\u2026 Someone said \u2018Would you like to meet Sam?\u2019 \u2018Sam?\u2019 \u2018Samuel Beckett.\u2019 Apparently, \u2018Sam\u2019 was in the kitchen. So I was led off and introduced to \u2018Sam\u2019. Of course I hadn\u2019t the faintest equipment to exploit this meeting. I have no idea what I should have said, and what he might have said in reply, and after a few minutes I backed away\u2026\u201d</p> <p>In the company of Irish compatriots, Beckett was more convivially Sam. Edna O\u2019Brien remembers the party that followed the first night of <em>Krapp\u2019s Last Tape,</em> starring Patrick Magee. \u201cSam wasn\u2019t happy, and told me he was going to go. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll come with you,\u2019 and offered him supper at home. As I was putting my key in the door, Sam said, \u2018Now, Edna, no wailing.\u2019 (I think he\u2019d heard about the Irish songs sung at my parties.) \u2018Please, no wailing\u2019. But then what does he do? \u2013 he sits down at my piano and starts to \u2018wail\u2019 himself, singing the songs of Schubert.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Brien remembers that \u201che stayed hours talking. I think he missed Ireland in a very particular way.\u201d Beckett\u2019s unique presence has stayed with her. \u201cHe had a remarkable innocence, the innocence of childhood, overlapped with an excavating intelligence \u2013 drunk or sober \u2013 and the bluest eyes like a wide-eyed bird. Those eyes were cold in their colour, but when he was moved by something, they were not cold.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, when Beckett was awarded the Nobel prize, a young professor of French literature at Reading University named James (Jim) Knowlson, who had been collecting rare editions of Beckett\u2019s work, approached the writer in Paris, with a rather cheeky proposal. Many of Beckett\u2019s typescripts had been sold to American archives, and Beckett himself always intended to deposit <em>En Attendant Godot</em> in the French national archive (where it is today).

      "bodyText": "\u201cI only had a minute.\u201d Jane Bown, the Observer\u2019s greatest postwar photographer, used to tell the story of the day she was sent to the Royal Court theatre to photograph Samuel Beckett, acclaimed author of Waiting For Godot. Bown was renowned for snatching photographs against the odds, but the shy, unsmiling, and nervously intense figure of Beckett, compared by one friend to an \u201cAztec eagle\u201d, presented a rare challenge. \u201cYou can have a minute,\u201d he announced, fiercely asserting the superiority of drama to journalism. He was tall and remote; she was short but dauntless. In the half-lit alleyway outside the stage door, Bown positioned her reluctant celebrity against the wall, and fired off barely a dozen shots, later remembering the arctic blue intensity of Beckett\u2019s eyes. After the prescribed minute of photographic concentration, she packed up her Leica, thanked him for his time, and fled, hoping that she\u2019d got a usable frame. This is a story I heard from Jane Bown herself on a number of occasions. In the making of the radio programme on which this article is based, every other quotation either comes from the Beckett Foundation or was specially recorded for the BBC. Sometimes, art and adversity click. When you examine the contact sheet today, all Bown\u2019s frames are in focus, but there\u2019s one that seems to capture her elusive subject perfectly, the face of the writer famous for \u201cEver tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\u201d Is a picture worth a thousand words? From that awkward and fleeting encounter Bown created, by chance, an indelible portrait of the inscrutable artist confronting the torments of existence. For my generation, this became the icon of \u201cBeckettian\u201d, the adjective that conjures the solitary artist, part seer, part hermit: ascetic, angular, and reclusive. Writers often have three lives \u2013 public, private, and secret \u2013 and Bown\u2019s photo, brilliant as it is, turns out to be slightly misleading. The shy, public Beckett of Godot was also the convivial writer cherished by a devoted circle of actors and friends in Dublin, Paris and London as Sam. The occluded \u201cSam\u201d represents the complex private side of Samuel Barclay Beckett, an Irishman born in Dublin on Good Friday, 1906. His family, like Oscar Wilde\u2019s, were middle-class Irish Protestants. As a young man, Sam was an excellent cricketer whose \u201cgritty\u201d batting appears in Wisden. Having studied at Trinity College, Dublin, he exiled himself, via London, to Paris. In the footsteps of James Joyce, it was his ambition to join the European avant garde. Between the wars, he sat at Joyce\u2019s feet during the torturous gestation of Finnegans Wake and developed his own gifts as a writer in the shadow of modernism. His first novel, Murphy, rejected many times, was finally published in 1938. Opening with a brilliantly alienated first line \u2013 \u201cThe sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\u201d \u2013 Murphy puzzled a lot of reviewers, was praised by Dylan Thomas, and sold badly. Then the war came, and the Nazi Panzers rolled into Paris. Beckett joined a Resistance cell, which was betrayed by a priest, fled south to unoccupied France, and lived for much of the war as a near vagrant and Resistance foot soldier in and around Roussillon in the Vaucluse. Returning to Paris after the liberation in 1944, he embarked on \u201cthe siege in the room\u201d, completing his trio of novels (Molloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable) to establish a cult reputation as a writer\u2019s writer, an avant gardist with a quirky wit. Possibly it was his experience of war and resistance that inspired En Attendant Godot. As he began to pick up the threads of his prewar life in Paris, it was this vision of existence \u2013 boredom, and waiting seasoned with a gallows humour \u2013 that he expressed in radical dramatic form. Being the author of Godot, Beckett was certainly a member of the avant garde, but an unlikely theatrical innovator. As a writer uniquely troubled by man\u2019s fate, Beckett\u2019s earliest dramatic fragments had been experimental disappointments. Now, to break free from the oppressive influence of modernism, he wrote in French. After many vicissitudes, his \u201ctragicomedy in two acts\u201d received its premiere in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Babylone, on 5 January 1953. There\u2019s a common view that it flopped. Actually, produced on a shoestring, it did quite well, with some favourable reviews. When the script of Waiting for Godot, in Beckett\u2019s English translation, crossed the Channel it landed on the desk of a young director, Peter Hall, who, admitting that he hadn\u2019t \u201cthe foggiest idea\u201d what it meant, produced it at the Arts theatre, London in August 1955. Speaking to the BBC in 1994, Hall recalled a \u201clyrical masterpiece\u201d, describing it as \u201ca great tragic play about living: what is it like to be alive, waiting for death\u2026? I also thought it was very funny, so I decided I\u2019d have a go.\u201d Godot had already provoked sarcastic hostility as the play in which \u201cnothing happens, twice\u201d, but Hall\u2019s production was a hit with the two most influential London critics, Ken Tynan (the Observer) and Harold Hobson (the Sunday Times), who both hailed this existential comedy as a masterpiece. It was also a theatrical revolution. From the moment Vladimir and Estragon step onto an empty stage with \u201cNothing to be done\u201d the audience is pitched into a strangely entertaining world in which the idea of boredom becomes a prolonged metaphor for the nature of existence, sustained by two tramps in vaudeville costume, trapped in exhilarating cross-talk, killing time in anticipation of \u201cMr Godot\u201d.Once Beckett had discovered his vocation, the plays that followed Godot (Endgame, Krapp\u2019s Last Tape and Happy Days) saw the myth of \u201cBeckett\u201d eclipse the identity of \u201cSam\u201d. In 1965, when he wrote Eh Joe, his first play for television, starring Jack MacGowran, he rehearsed a young leading lady from the West End named Si\u00e2n Phillips, then married to Peter O\u2019Toole. She was to play the Voice, a viperish whisper in Joe\u2019s ear. Phillips, who had seen Godot as a student, had no idea what to expect, and turned up for rehearsals \u201cprobably sporting a bit of Dior to boost my confidence\u201d, hot from the West End. \u201cI had a marvellous hairdo,\u201d she remembers, \u201cand a little hat.\u201d Then Beckett arrived. \u201cThis vision came in. He was so beautifully dressed with the most exquisite sweater I\u2019d ever seen \u2013 a silk polo-neck I think \u2013 with the softest cashmere jacket. He had these wonderful blue eyes (like O\u2019Toole). There\u2019s a picture taken of us at that moment. I look like a frightened rabbit. He looks like a beautiful bird of prey, incredibly handsome, a merciless god. I knew I was in the presence of a great man.\u201d Quite soon, Phillips discovered that while \u201cworking with Sam was one of the best things that ever happened to me\u201d, it was also \u201cthe most exhausting thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d She smiles at the memory. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anything like it. He was nothing but courteous, and he wasn\u2019t a bully, but he wanted to get it done his way, which was \u2018the only way\u2019.\u201d This, she discovered, was to treat the text like music. She imitates the beat. \u201cHe metronomed it for me.\u201d Some years later, Phillips encountered another version of Beckett\u2019s private side. She recalls that O\u2019Toole wanted to make a film of Godot, but \u201cSam wouldn\u2019t allow it\u201d. When the two men quarrelled at a dinner in Manchester Square in London, Phillips witnessed Beckett\u2019s artistic intransigence at first hand. \u201cHe said Godot would never be filmed, the only actor he cared about in movies was Buster Keaton, a film could not equal the theatre. It went on and on, very convivial, but quite aggressive. They seemed to become more Irish the more they drank.\u201d Beckett was often in London in the mid-60s, but was also at home in Paris with a circle of artistic friends that included the French-Israeli painter Avigdor Arikha whose eldest child, Alba, was Beckett\u2019s goddaughter. Alba, now a novelist, was just a child, but she remembers \u201cblue eyes like the sea\u201d. As a small girl, she remembers \u201csomebody very tall picking me up. His cheekbones were like a Giacometti sculpture.\u201d Alba\u2019s memory echoes the Bown portrait, but she recalls a gentleness to his angularity. \u201cHe had a raspy kind of cigarillo voice, and he could be very quiet. His silences mattered as much as his words. He had an aura, but he was easy to talk to. We used to play Mozart and Schubert together, a very intimate experience. He came for dinner once a month, would recite poetry \u2013 a Shakespeare sonnet, Keats\u2019s Ode to a Nightingale \u2013 and listen to classical music.\u201d Beckett\u2019s visits to the Avigdor household were partly an escape from his fame. \u201cHe was a solitary man,\u201d says Arikha. \u201cPeople used to pester him, and he did not like celebrity.\u201d As \u201cSam\u201d, she says, he nurtured a circle of \u201cabout five close friends\u201d. These included stage designer Jocelyn Herbert, literary critic AJ \u201cCon\u201d Leventhal, actors Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Magee and Jack MacGowran, director Alan Schneider, and the translator Barbara Bray. In his prime (from 1950 to 1969), Beckett was peripatetic: flitting from Paris or Berlin to New York, Ireland and London. In the late 60s, Jack MacGowran\u2019s friendship with a young journalist from Bristol named Tom Stoppard led to a tantalising non-encounter at a party in Portland Place, near the BBC. Stoppard confides: \u201cI was at that time in a strange state of [Beckett] worship, and it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that you could actually meet him. To me, he was a kind of spiritual presence. So I was incapacitated. I was at this party, feeling like a yokel from Bristol\u2026 Someone said \u2018Would you like to meet Sam?\u2019 \u2018Sam?\u2019 \u2018Samuel Beckett.\u2019 Apparently, \u2018Sam\u2019 was in the kitchen. So I was led off and introduced to \u2018Sam\u2019. Of course I hadn\u2019t the faintest equipment to exploit this meeting. I have no idea what I should have said, and what he might have said in reply, and after a few minutes I backed away\u2026\u201d In the company of Irish compatriots, Beckett was more convivially Sam. Edna O\u2019Brien remembers the party that followed the first night of Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, starring Patrick Magee. \u201cSam wasn\u2019t happy, and told me he was going to go. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll come with you,\u2019 and offered him supper at home. As I was putting my key in the door, Sam said, \u2018Now, Edna, no wailing.\u2019 (I think he\u2019d heard about the Irish songs sung at my parties.) \u2018Please, no wailing\u2019. But then what does he do? \u2013 he sits down at my piano and starts to \u2018wail\u2019 himself, singing the songs of Schubert.\u201d O\u2019Brien remembers that \u201che stayed hours talking. I think he missed Ireland in a very particular way.\u201d Beckett\u2019s unique presence has stayed with her. \u201cHe had a remarkable innocence, the innocence of childhood, overlapped with an excavating intelligence \u2013 drunk or sober \u2013 and the bluest eyes like a wide-eyed bird. Those eyes were cold in their colour, but when he was moved by something, they were not cold.\u201d In 1969, when Beckett was awarded the Nobel prize, a young professor of French literature at Reading University named James (Jim) Knowlson, who had been collecting rare editions of Beckett\u2019s work, approached the writer in Paris, with a rather cheeky proposal. Many of Beckett\u2019s typescripts had been sold to American archives, and Beckett himself always intended to deposit En Attendant Godot in the French national archive (where it is today). But there were still many letters, drafts, lesser works, theatrical memorabilia: Knowlson suggested, and Beckett agreed, that these should be preserved at Reading University. Today, Beckett\u2019s English-language archive is housed in one of the most surreal research centres in Britain, the university\u2019s Museum of English Rural Life, a converted late-Victorian red brick mansion popular with school parties and mums with toddlers. To step into the world of Godot, Krapp, and Pozzo, the visitor must pass haywains, pitchforks and china roosters. There\u2019s a consensus at MERL that Beckett, the outsider, would have enjoyed the absurdity of finding his archives next to dairy farming data and vintage combine-harvester models. Perhaps this is not as disjointed as it seems. Less than a mile from MERL is the sinister Victorian facade of HM Prison Reading, the scene of Oscar Wilde\u2019s degrading incarceration in 1896, two years of penal servitude with hard labour that effectively killed him. So the Beckett who began as a disciple of one great Irish writer finds his life\u2019s work stored for posterity in the town known for The Ballad of Reading Gaol. In 1971, having failed to persuade the reclusive Beckett to visit an exhibition of his collected papers, Knowlson invited Harold Pinter to the Beckett Foundation. This was a request Pinter could hardly refuse. He had been obsessed with Beckett\u2019s work ever since, as an impressionable teenager, he had stolen a copy of Murphy from Hackney library; his own plays owed an important debt to the wit, clarity, and precision of Beckett\u2019s example. Writing as a young man, he had expressed something of the spell that Beckett\u2019s work held over his imagination in the 1950s: The farther he goes the more good it does me. I don\u2019t want philosophies, tracts, dogmas, creeds, ways out, truths, answers, nothing from the bargain basement. He is the most courageous, remorseless writer going and the more he grinds my nose in the shit the more I am grateful to him\u2026. His work is beautiful. Pinter had invited Beckett to the first French production of The Caretaker, and had struck up a close friendship on the basis of a rare kind of conviviality involving alcohol, theatre \u2013 and cricket. (Both playwrights were fanatical followers of the English team\u2019s performance.) On their first meeting in Paris in the early 60s Beckett had insisted on showing Pinter the nightlife of Paris, and had driven his guest at high speed in a battered Citro\u00ebn from bar to bar until, at about four in the morning, they had ended up having onion soup in Les Halles. Pinter\u2019s account of this moment opens another window on to \u201cSam\u2019s\u201d private life. \u201cI was overcome,\u201d Pinter remembers, \u201cthrough alcohol and tobacco, with indigestion and heartburn, so I lay down on the table, and when I looked up, he [Beckett] was gone. I had no idea where he\u2019d gone, and he remained away so I thought perhaps that this had all been a dream\u2026 I think I went to sleep on the table, and about 45 minutes later I looked up, and there he was, and he had a package. He said: \u2018I\u2019ve been over the whole of damn Paris to find this, and finally I found it.\u2019 And he gave me a tin of bicarbonate of soda, which did indeed work wonders.\u201d Pinter (according to his widow, Lady Antonia Fraser) used to love discussing vital cricketing issues such as England\u2019s Ashes prospects with \u201cSam\u201d. He would also send Beckett copies of his plays, and visited him on his deathbed. Alba Arikha describes her own farewell at the nursing home in which her godfather ended his days. \u201cHe was lying in bed, and looked as majestic as ever. His main concern, I think, was that he could get his cigarettes and his whisky. He lay in bed, and held my hand. He murmured \u2018Je suis fatigu\u00e9.

Your works are strewn with Irish graves.\u2019 He said: \u2018No, no. I\u2019m not going back.\u2019 He was very determined. I said: \u2018I am. I own a grave, a lovely grave.\u2019 He was most puzzled and almost disapproving: \u2018So you\u2019re going back for an eternal dose of disgust?\u2019 Even though Ireland was in his blood and his bones, he was full of little vengeances.\u201d O\u2019Brien pauses in memory. \u201cAnyway, we got through that, and I could see he was tired. I said: \u2018I should let you go now.\u2019 \u2018Not yet, not yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018Stay a bit longer.\u2019\u201d So she stayed. \u201cAbsolutely nothing more was said,\u201d she tells me, her voice low and almost faltering with emotion. \u201cAnd it was just as happy and natural as the night of the Kerry dances.\u201d Archive on 4: Beckett\u2019s Last Tapes, presented by Robert McCrum, will be on Radio 4, Saturday 10 August, 8pm",

      "body": "<p>Valerie Cooper has always budgeted carefully in order to pay her utility bills on time. Now she faces cancelling a holiday to celebrate her husband\u2019s 70th birthday after her supplier, Shell, turned her \u00a31,450 credit into \u00a3666 arrears overnight. The cause was the botched installation of a smart meter which was supposed to save her money.</p> <p>\u201cAn engineer came in October 2017 and by 8pm he was still having problems trying to get the new meter to pick signals up,\u201d she says. \u201cHe took it out and put our old meter back in and returned next morning. The smart meter still didn\u2019t work so he fitted another one \u2013 which already had a reading on it.\u201d</p> <p>Fearing that the inherited meter reading would affect her bills, Cooper informed Shell, which told her to photograph the screen and email it. She did so repeatedly and spent the ensuing months asking vainly for an updated bill. In the meantime, she continued to pay her usual monthly direct debit of \u00a3104 and was told that she was \u00a31,450 in credit. Then, 18 months after the abortive installation, the updated bill arrived demanding \u00a3666. \u201cI am retired and disabled, my husband is worried to death about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can no way find that sort of money and I don\u2019t believe we owe it, since they haven\u2019t read the meter for nearly two years.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper is one of many householders who have found themselves paying a high price for the government\u2019s \u00a311bn smart meter rollout, which is supposed to send data automatically to suppliers and abolish the uncertainty of estimated readings. Some have had to foot the bill for repairs after technicians damaged their property. Others, like Cooper, have faced fantastical bills because their new meter failed to function. And hundreds have found that their meters stopped working when they switched supplier to cut costs.</p> <p>Shell, while admitting that its mistakes caused Cooper\u2019s spiralling debt, insist she is liable, although under rules issued by the regulator, Ofgem, companies can\u2019t retrospectively charge customers for energy used more than 12 months ago.</p> <p>It offered to reduce the debt by \u00a3300 as a goodwill gesture and spread the balance over an affordable repayment plan. \u201cWe\u2019d like to apologise to Mrs Cooper for the stress caused by our customer service failures,\u201d said the company, whose website promises that smart meters give back control to the customer. \u201cAfter looking into her account we found that her meter exchange was initially not updated on our systems, which is the reason why her account was billed incorrectly.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, we didn\u2019t do a good enough job to promptly fix the issue, but we have registered her meter exchange on the system.\u201d</p> <p>Suzanne Godfrey has been left with disabled heating and hot water systems after EDF sent a technician to install a smart meter, and she has been told she is liable for repairs. \u201cDuring installation they turned all the power off and then back on but couldn\u2019t restore power to the underfloor heating or secondary hot water loop,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThey sent an electrician but he didn\u2019t know how to restore the power. They refuse to send a specialist heating engineer and have questioned the quality and state of the equipment, which is only three years old and was working up to the moment EDF turned off the power.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m stunned that a large company can request access to my home, carry out work that causes a problem and then walk away from it.\u201d</p> <p>EDF says that customers are sent warnings to turn off sensitive equipment, including boilers, before a smart meter installation \u2013 Godfrey has denied receiving this \u2013 and explained that it will not guarantee to refund the cost of a heating engineer as the system may have had an underlying fault.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Samuel Crisp was left without heating or electricity through one winter\u2019s night after having a smart meter installed by Ovo. It transpired that the meter had been accidentally set to a pay-as-you-go setting and, after running through the emergency balance, his supply was disconnected even though his online account was \u00a3300 in credit. Ovo awarded him \u00a3150 as a gesture of goodwill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86fad4c2430f2ff431aa8a0cf2b87b83a7773401\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86fad4c2430f2ff431aa8a0cf2b87b83a7773401/0_166_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A smart meter by a thermostat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>S</em>eeing energy use live on a meter was intended to help save money, but estimates of potential savings have been revised down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics claim that corners are being cut in the rush to meet official targets. In 2016, the government announced that it expected suppliers to have offered or installed smart meters to all customers by 2020, a target that\u2019s proved unrealistic.</p> <p>The initiative is in response to the European commission\u2019s 2009 electricity directive, which envisaged smart technology being offered to 80% of homes across the EU by 2020. The UK opted for 100% coverage by the same date and handed responsibility to energy suppliers, rather than gas and electricity network operators, who have the workforce and infrastructure to install whole streets at a time, instead of home by home.</p> <p>The National Audit Office has predicted that taxpayers will end up paying half a billion pounds more than expected for the project over years to come. Meanwhile, the government has revised the annual sum it reckons a smart meter will save each household down from \u00a326 to \u00a311, while the \u00a3270 cost of each installation is passed on through higher bills.</p> <p>In the rush to meet deadlines and avoid fines, suppliers are still installing old first-generation meters which cease to transmit live readings if a customer switches suppliers, because not enough updated meters are available.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a shortage of properly trained technicians. Consumer group Which? estimates installations would have to triple to 30 a minute to fulfil the government target, although Ofgem insists that suppliers have adequate resources in place.</p> <p>Martyn James of the complaints website Resolver says it has received hundreds of complaints of inept installers and botched jobs.</p> <p>\u201cCustomers have complained of meters with holes drilled into them to fix to walls, damaging the mechanisms of the meter, long waits for missing parts and problems with displays that don\u2019t work, wrong readings and random bills,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIn one case, an installer caused a gas leak and when a team came to replace the pipework they found it would have to run through an asbestos panel. They insisted the customer must pay a four-figure sum to have it removed by specialists before they would make good.\u201d</p> <p>Most suppliers limit their responsibilities in their terms and conditions. According to Ofgem, customers may be required to update hazardous connections and appliances before an installation can proceed \u2013 which, if the old meter has already been removed, can leave them with a large and unavoidable bill. If damage is caused by the installation, the supplier should make good, but the problem is proving negligence if the company denies responsibility.</p> <p>Customers who feel they have been left unfairly out of pocket can take their case to the Energy Ombudsman, which received 86 complaints about substandard installations over the past 12 months. \u201cIn circumstances where the supplier is at fault for damage to a customer\u2019s property, we would expect the supplier to compensate the customer,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Valerie Cooper has accepted Shell\u2019s \u00a3300 offer, although she still disputes the accuracy of the bill. \u201cI was going to fight it to the end but I can\u2019t take the stress any more,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to pay the rest straight away to get rid of them and I will save up and take my husband away another time.\u201d</p> <h2>Is it time to call \u2018stop\u2019 as the rollout rolls on?<br></h2> <p> Smart meters automate readings in order to to make energy use easier for householders to understand, and are considered a critical upgrade of the energy system, helping the UK\u2019s electricity grid cope with an increasing but variable amount of wind and solar power.</p> <p>Last year, Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer fronted a PR campaign to encourage people to use the smart meters, visiting cities across the UK in the \u201cSmart Energy\u201d tour.</p> <p>The devices could also reduce the need for costly upgrades to power grids, aid integration of electric cars into the energy system and open up a host of innovative tariffs with energy costs based on time of use.</p> <p>While seen as an essential foundation for much of the UK\u2019s energy future, their rollout has been fraught with problems in the attempt to reach the 2020 deadline of installing up to 53 million devices. There have been calls for one of Britain\u2019s biggest national infrastructure projects to stop because of problems that have occurred after customers switch. Many meters have lost their smart functionality after people switched supplier \u2013 meaning consumers once again have to manually submit readings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Valerie Cooper has always budgeted carefully in order to pay her utility bills on time. Now she faces cancelling a holiday to celebrate her husband\u2019s 70th birthday after her supplier, Shell, turned her \u00a31,450 credit into \u00a3666 arrears overnight. The cause was the botched installation of a smart meter which was supposed to save her money. \u201cAn engineer came in October 2017 and by 8pm he was still having problems trying to get the new meter to pick signals up,\u201d she says. \u201cHe took it out and put our old meter back in and returned next morning. The smart meter still didn\u2019t work so he fitted another one \u2013 which already had a reading on it.\u201d Fearing that the inherited meter reading would affect her bills, Cooper informed Shell, which told her to photograph the screen and email it. She did so repeatedly and spent the ensuing months asking vainly for an updated bill. In the meantime, she continued to pay her usual monthly direct debit of \u00a3104 and was told that she was \u00a31,450 in credit. Then, 18 months after the abortive installation, the updated bill arrived demanding \u00a3666. \u201cI am retired and disabled, my husband is worried to death about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can no way find that sort of money and I don\u2019t believe we owe it, since they haven\u2019t read the meter for nearly two years.\u201d Cooper is one of many householders who have found themselves paying a high price for the government\u2019s \u00a311bn smart meter rollout, which is supposed to send data automatically to suppliers and abolish the uncertainty of estimated readings. Some have had to foot the bill for repairs after technicians damaged their property. Others, like Cooper, have faced fantastical bills because their new meter failed to function. And hundreds have found that their meters stopped working when they switched supplier to cut costs. Shell, while admitting that its mistakes caused Cooper\u2019s spiralling debt, insist she is liable, although under rules issued by the regulator, Ofgem, companies can\u2019t retrospectively charge customers for energy used more than 12 months ago. It offered to reduce the debt by \u00a3300 as a goodwill gesture and spread the balance over an affordable repayment plan. \u201cWe\u2019d like to apologise to Mrs Cooper for the stress caused by our customer service failures,\u201d said the company, whose website promises that smart meters give back control to the customer. \u201cAfter looking into her account we found that her meter exchange was initially not updated on our systems, which is the reason why her account was billed incorrectly. \u201cClearly, we didn\u2019t do a good enough job to promptly fix the issue, but we have registered her meter exchange on the system.\u201d Suzanne Godfrey has been left with disabled heating and hot water systems after EDF sent a technician to install a smart meter, and she has been told she is liable for repairs. \u201cDuring installation they turned all the power off and then back on but couldn\u2019t restore power to the underfloor heating or secondary hot water loop,\u201d she says. \u201cThey sent an electrician but he didn\u2019t know how to restore the power. They refuse to send a specialist heating engineer and have questioned the quality and state of the equipment, which is only three years old and was working up to the moment EDF turned off the power. \u201cI\u2019m stunned that a large company can request access to my home, carry out work that causes a problem and then walk away from it.\u201d EDF says that customers are sent warnings to turn off sensitive equipment, including boilers, before a smart meter installation \u2013 Godfrey has denied receiving this \u2013 and explained that it will not guarantee to refund the cost of a heating engineer as the system may have had an underlying fault. Meanwhile, Samuel Crisp was left without heating or electricity through one winter\u2019s night after having a smart meter installed by Ovo. It transpired that the meter had been accidentally set to a pay-as-you-go setting and, after running through the emergency balance, his supply was disconnected even though his online account was \u00a3300 in credit. Ovo awarded him \u00a3150 as a gesture of goodwill. Critics claim that corners are being cut in the rush to meet official targets. In 2016, the government announced that it expected suppliers to have offered or installed smart meters to all customers by 2020, a target that\u2019s proved unrealistic. The initiative is in response to the European commission\u2019s 2009 electricity directive, which envisaged smart technology being offered to 80% of homes across the EU by 2020. The UK opted for 100% coverage by the same date and handed responsibility to energy suppliers, rather than gas and electricity network operators, who have the workforce and infrastructure to install whole streets at a time, instead of home by home. The National Audit Office has predicted that taxpayers will end up paying half a billion pounds more than expected for the project over years to come. Meanwhile, the government has revised the annual sum it reckons a smart meter will save each household down from \u00a326 to \u00a311, while the \u00a3270 cost of each installation is passed on through higher bills. In the rush to meet deadlines and avoid fines, suppliers are still installing old first-generation meters which cease to transmit live readings if a customer switches suppliers, because not enough updated meters are available. There\u2019s also a shortage of properly trained technicians. Consumer group Which? estimates installations would have to triple to 30 a minute to fulfil the government target, although Ofgem insists that suppliers have adequate resources in place. Martyn James of the complaints website Resolver says it has received hundreds of complaints of inept installers and botched jobs. \u201cCustomers have complained of meters with holes drilled into them to fix to walls, damaging the mechanisms of the meter, long waits for missing parts and problems with displays that don\u2019t work, wrong readings and random bills,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one case, an installer caused a gas leak and when a team came to replace the pipework they found it would have to run through an asbestos panel. They insisted the customer must pay a four-figure sum to have it removed by specialists before they would make good.\u201d Most suppliers limit their responsibilities in their terms and conditions. According to Ofgem, customers may be required to update hazardous connections and appliances before an installation can proceed \u2013 which, if the old meter has already been removed, can leave them with a large and unavoidable bill. If damage is caused by the installation, the supplier should make good, but the problem is proving negligence if the company denies responsibility. Customers who feel they have been left unfairly out of pocket can take their case to the Energy Ombudsman, which received 86 complaints about substandard installations over the past 12 months. \u201cIn circumstances where the supplier is at fault for damage to a customer\u2019s property, we would expect the supplier to compensate the customer,\u201d it says. Valerie Cooper has accepted Shell\u2019s \u00a3300 offer, although she still disputes the accuracy of the bill. \u201cI was going to fight it to the end but I can\u2019t take the stress any more,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to pay the rest straight away to get rid of them and I will save up and take my husband away another time.\u201d Is it time to call \u2018stop\u2019 as the rollout rolls on? Smart meters automate readings in order to to make energy use easier for householders to understand, and are considered a critical upgrade of the energy system, helping the UK\u2019s electricity grid cope with an increasing but variable amount of wind and solar power. Last year, Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer fronted a PR campaign to encourage people to use the smart meters, visiting cities across the UK in the \u201cSmart Energy\u201d tour. The devices could also reduce the need for costly upgrades to power grids, aid integration of electric cars into the energy system and open up a host of innovative tariffs with energy costs based on time of use. While seen as an essential foundation for much of the UK\u2019s energy future, their rollout has been fraught with problems in the attempt to reach the 2020 deadline of installing up to 53 million devices. There have been calls for one of Britain\u2019s biggest national infrastructure projects to stop because of problems that have occurred after customers switch. Many meters have lost their smart functionality after people switched supplier \u2013 meaning consumers once again have to manually submit readings.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s briefest prime minister was George Canning in the early 19th century who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39653671\" title=\"\">lasted just 119 days</a>. He had the excuse that he died. A new record will be set if Boris Johnson is impelled to call an autumn election and the voters put the boot to his backside. The May premiership will have been followed by the mayfly premiership. He will be deposited in the dustbin of history as the fool who clawed all the way up to the pinnacle of the greasy pole, only then to almost instantly plunge off it. He has sufficient self-knowledge to grasp that this ignominy would be hugely satisfying not just to the great swaths of the country who would think that fate richly deserved, but to many of his colleagues as well. So when <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49125078\" title=\"\">he swears</a> that he has no intention of calling an election before the end of October, I almost believe him. My hunch is that he is extremely scared by the idea. Like many of his kind, outward bravado is the bluffer\u2019s mask on a pulsating mass of insecurities.</p> <p>Most of Westminster is increasingly convinced nevertheless that an election is coming and it is not hard to see why. The speeches introducing himself to the country as its prime minister have not been those of a man settling in for a long slog to 2022. They exude the sweaty aroma of a leader warming up for a dash to the country. He seeks to frame the argument as a contest between his blustery vision of a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49107417\" title=\"\">\u201cgolden age\u201d</a> for \u201cthe greatest place on Earth\u201d and the negativity of opponents whom he casts as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-first-speech-pm-panel\" title=\"\">\u201cthe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters\u201d</a>.

The bones of a Tory manifesto targeted at swing voters can be seen in the promises to splash more cash on law and order, education, the railways and housing. His forays to the West Midlands on Friday and the north-west yesterday, regions packed with marginal, must-win seats, also had the hallmarks of a leader limbering up for an election.</p> <p>Then there is the composition of his cabinet. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnsons-cabinet-cull-the-departures-so-far\" title=\"\">brutal culling</a> of so many senior ministers looked like a re-enactment of the multiple revenge killings at the climax of <em>The Godfather</em>, a cinematic bloodbath that he recently revealed to be his <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/boris-johnson-the-godfather-favourite-movie-scene-8991166\" title=\"\">favourite movie scene</a>. This was not just a display of the cold-eyed ruthlessness that lurks just below the clowning surface of this prime minister. It also displayed a desire for his government to be viewed as an entirely new one. An election this year would be a request to the country to extend Tory rule from nine years to 14, a big ask. It will suit him if voters can be persuaded to forget the May government and memories of the Cameron era are also obliviated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36d5c7a90719f7c6996b3c11784fb263ce6c6822\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d5c7a90719f7c6996b3c11784fb263ce6c6822/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson holds his first cabinet meeting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A consequence of the Midsummer Massacre of ministers is to swell the ranks of potential Brexit rebels on the Tory backbenches.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A consequence of the Midsummer Massacre of ministers is to swell the ranks of potential Brexit rebels on the Tory backbenches. The prime minister\u2019s friends are predicting that Philip Hammond and other ex-members of the May government will be \u201ca nightmare\u201d. He has created another tribe of resentful backbench Tories by removing Jeremy Hunt from the Foreign Office and purging all his supporters, even the Brexiters among them, from the top of government. Having this many angry colleagues seething on the backbenches would be a headache for a prime minister with a plump cushion of support in the Commons. He is squatting on a tiny and evaporating majority. The only way to change that is to try to alter the maths in parliament.</p> <p>The most compelling reason to think that he will choose, or be forced into, an election is the trajectory he is taking on Brexit. During the leadership contest, some Tory moderates tried to reconcile themselves to the spectre of a Johnson government, or to rationalise their desire to get a job in it, by telling themselves that he would soften his approach once he had blagged his way into Number 10. There\u2019s been absolutely no indication that he is tempering his position; rather, he is hardening his red lines. Brexit ultras now occupy every senior ministerial position engaged with the enterprise and he has doubled down on his demands that the withdrawal agreement be ripped up.</p> <p>The supposed logic of ramping up preparations for a no-deal outcome is that this will induce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/michel-barnier-boris-johnsons-combative-rhetoric-targets-eu-unity\" title=\"\">the EU</a> to blink and drop the repeated insistence of its leaders that the agreement can\u2019t be reopened. They will then buckle and give him concessions that they wouldn\u2019t offer to Mrs May. Now ask yourself this: how likely are Europe\u2019s leaders to make themselves look very stupid in order to make Boris Johnson look very clever? Especially when most of them continue to think that no deal is a bluff, because they believe Britain\u2019s parliament won\u2019t allow it?</p> <p>I suspect that, deep down, he knows that there is a vanishingly slight chance of securing a radically recast agreement. So the best educated guess about where he will get to in the autumn is this. There will be no better deal with the EU and parliament will prevent him from leaving without one. There would then be three avenues forward. One: he could seek another extension to the deadline for withdrawal. This would be a humiliating betrayal of his solemn pledge to his party that Britain is leaving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\" title=\"\">\u201ccome what may\u201d</a> on Halloween and that would put rocket boosters on support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Two: he could seek to resolve the deadlock by calling a fresh referendum. Mr Cummings used to argue for a two-stage plebiscite, but trying to take that course now would shatter the cabinet and detonate the Tory party. In these circumstances, option three \u2013 calling an election to seek a mandate for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 looks like his only viable choice. It could anyway be forced upon him by a successful no-confidence vote in the Commons.</p> <p>We know how he would wage the campaign. I did my best, he would say, but I was thwarted by those perfidious Europeans and Remoaner MPs. Give me the mandate to finally liberate us from the yoke of Brussels. This would not unite and heal Britain \u2013 it would divide the country even more deeply and nastily. But he doesn\u2019t have to unite Britain to win an election this way. He doesn\u2019t even have to get a majority of Britons to agree with him.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s briefest prime minister was George Canning in the early 19th century who lasted just 119 days. He had the excuse that he died. A new record will be set if Boris Johnson is impelled to call an autumn election and the voters put the boot to his backside. The May premiership will have been followed by the mayfly premiership. He will be deposited in the dustbin of history as the fool who clawed all the way up to the pinnacle of the greasy pole, only then to almost instantly plunge off it. He has sufficient self-knowledge to grasp that this ignominy would be hugely satisfying not just to the great swaths of the country who would think that fate richly deserved, but to many of his colleagues as well. So when he swears that he has no intention of calling an election before the end of October, I almost believe him. My hunch is that he is extremely scared by the idea. Like many of his kind, outward bravado is the bluffer\u2019s mask on a pulsating mass of insecurities. Most of Westminster is increasingly convinced nevertheless that an election is coming and it is not hard to see why. The speeches introducing himself to the country as its prime minister have not been those of a man settling in for a long slog to 2022. They exude the sweaty aroma of a leader warming up for a dash to the country. He seeks to frame the argument as a contest between his blustery vision of a \u201cgolden age\u201d for \u201cthe greatest place on Earth\u201d and the negativity of opponents whom he casts as \u201cthe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters\u201d. Deploying optimism can be effective as a campaign device and flamboyant pledges can seduce the gullible, but only during the shortish interval before reality catches up with the rhetoric. Another electoral rune is importing veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, including its mastermind, Dominic Cummings, into Number 10. \u201cTwenty thousand more police officers\u201d is sloganising from the same playbook that brought you \u201c\u00a3350 million more for the NHS every week\u201d during the 2016 referendum. The bones of a Tory manifesto targeted at swing voters can be seen in the promises to splash more cash on law and order, education, the railways and housing. His forays to the West Midlands on Friday and the north-west yesterday, regions packed with marginal, must-win seats, also had the hallmarks of a leader limbering up for an election. Then there is the composition of his cabinet. The brutal culling of so many senior ministers looked like a re-enactment of the multiple revenge killings at the climax of The Godfather, a cinematic bloodbath that he recently revealed to be his favourite movie scene. This was not just a display of the cold-eyed ruthlessness that lurks just below the clowning surface of this prime minister. It also displayed a desire for his government to be viewed as an entirely new one. An election this year would be a request to the country to extend Tory rule from nine years to 14, a big ask. It will suit him if voters can be persuaded to forget the May government and memories of the Cameron era are also obliviated. A consequence of the Midsummer Massacre of ministers is to swell the ranks of potential Brexit rebels on the Tory backbenches. The prime minister\u2019s friends are predicting that Philip Hammond and other ex-members of the May government will be \u201ca nightmare\u201d. He has created another tribe of resentful backbench Tories by removing Jeremy Hunt from the Foreign Office and purging all his supporters, even the Brexiters among them, from the top of government. Having this many angry colleagues seething on the backbenches would be a headache for a prime minister with a plump cushion of support in the Commons. He is squatting on a tiny and evaporating majority. The only way to change that is to try to alter the maths in parliament. The most compelling reason to think that he will choose, or be forced into, an election is the trajectory he is taking on Brexit. During the leadership contest, some Tory moderates tried to reconcile themselves to the spectre of a Johnson government, or to rationalise their desire to get a job in it, by telling themselves that he would soften his approach once he had blagged his way into Number 10. There\u2019s been absolutely no indication that he is tempering his position; rather, he is hardening his red lines. Brexit ultras now occupy every senior ministerial position engaged with the enterprise and he has doubled down on his demands that the withdrawal agreement be ripped up. The supposed logic of ramping up preparations for a no-deal outcome is that this will induce the EU to blink and drop the repeated insistence of its leaders that the agreement can\u2019t be reopened. They will then buckle and give him concessions that they wouldn\u2019t offer to Mrs May. Now ask yourself this: how likely are Europe\u2019s leaders to make themselves look very stupid in order to make Boris Johnson look very clever? Especially when most of them continue to think that no deal is a bluff, because they believe Britain\u2019s parliament won\u2019t allow it? I suspect that, deep down, he knows that there is a vanishingly slight chance of securing a radically recast agreement. So the best educated guess about where he will get to in the autumn is this. There will be no better deal with the EU and parliament will prevent him from leaving without one. There would then be three avenues forward. One: he could seek another extension to the deadline for withdrawal. This would be a humiliating betrayal of his solemn pledge to his party that Britain is leaving \u201ccome what may\u201d on Halloween and that would put rocket boosters on support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Two: he could seek to resolve the deadlock by calling a fresh referendum. Mr Cummings used to argue for a two-stage plebiscite, but trying to take that course now would shatter the cabinet and detonate the Tory party. In these circumstances, option three \u2013 calling an election to seek a mandate for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 looks like his only viable choice. It could anyway be forced upon him by a successful no-confidence vote in the Commons. We know how he would wage the campaign. I did my best, he would say, but I was thwarted by those perfidious Europeans and Remoaner MPs. Give me the mandate to finally liberate us from the yoke of Brussels. This would not unite and heal Britain \u2013 it would divide the country even more deeply and nastily. But he doesn\u2019t have to unite Britain to win an election this way. He doesn\u2019t even have to get a majority of Britons to agree with him. He just has to get enough voters in enough places to put him back in Number 10. An early election would seek to exploit the honeymoon that most new prime ministers enjoy for a while. The Opinium poll we publish this weekend indicates some evidence of a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, as it will inevitably be called, as Leave voters migrate back to the Conservatives. The Tories are up seven points and the Brexit party is down seven. He has a substantial 21-point lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the \u201cbest prime minister\u201d question. The dire condition of the Labour party is obviously an encouragement to Tory thinking that a swift election could hit what some of the prime minister\u2019s allies call \u201ca sweet spot\u201d. Faced with the threat of a Johnson election campaign designed to mobilise the Leave vote behind him, rational folk argue that the opposition parties must put together some kind of Remainer alliance and get working on it urgently. It is possible to envisage the Greens, the Lib Dems and the Welsh nationalists forming a common front.

Oca\u00f1a finished four Tours of the eight he started, winning in 1973.</p> <p>As Madiot said, \u201cjustice\u201d may be served next year or the year after. Or Pinot may eventually be forced to decide it is not going to happen \u2013 that the mental and physical torture involved are not worth the potential gains \u2013 and devote himself to winning the great mountain stages and the one-day Classics that are clearly well within his reach.

Most dramatic of these \u2013 and most similar to his fate this year in the Tour \u2013 was last year\u2019s Giro d\u2019Italia, where he was lying third overall at the start of the final day\u2019s mountain stage. Suffering from the onset of pneumonia, he was shepherded through the stage by his teammates, finishing 45 minutes behind. He was taken to hospital after the stage. It may be that Pinot lacks the physical robustness needed to compete on a daily basis at the highest level in the final week of a Grand Tour. There is no doubting his power and superlative climbing ability, while he seems to have become mentally stronger in recent years in spite of his tribulations, but even before this year\u2019s Tour started his health was highlighted as the one thing that might prevent him becoming France\u2019s first Tour winner since Hinault in 1985. Pinot will return to his fastness in the village of M\u00e9lisey in eastern France, to the animals he tends amid the peace and quiet and he will bounce back as he has done before. Last year, once his health had been restored, he was determined enough to win two illustrious mountain stages in the Vuelta, to ride a strong world championships, then take the Giro di Lombardia, one of cycling\u2019s five \u201cMonuments\u201d, the sport\u2019s most prestigious one-day races. On Friday Pinot\u2019s manager, Marc Madiot \u2013 never without a phrase to hit the cockles of the French cycling public\u2019s heart \u2013 railed against fate and said he believes that \u201cjustice\u201d means that one day Pinot will win the Tour de France. Pinot himself said he will return in 2020 and he may eventually take his Tour. Some do, even that most accident-prone of champions, the much-loved Spaniard Luis Oca\u00f1a, once described as suffering from what is \u201calmost an occupational illness among cyclists, hypochondria\u201d. Oca\u00f1a finished four Tours of the eight he started, winning in 1973. As Madiot said, \u201cjustice\u201d may be served next year or the year after. Or Pinot may eventually be forced to decide it is not going to happen \u2013 that the mental and physical torture involved are not worth the potential gains \u2013 and devote himself to winning the great mountain stages and the one-day Classics that are clearly well within his reach. There would be no dishonour in that.",

But now I\u2019m in Piraeus, 10km south-west of central Athens, and it feels right. I\u2019m going to what I hope are out-of-the-way islands \u2013 Ikaria, Kalymnos, Amorgos, Folegandros, Milos and Sifnos \u2013 each with a unique character. A great loop of seafaring will, over the next few weeks, take me across the Aegean Sea and back here.</p> <p>But first I have a night in the port. I wander up to my hotel, The Alex, and discover that it has opened that very day. I am its first-ever guest. Konstantinos, the excited owner, is bent on proving that Piraeus is a worthy stopover and takes me on a whirlwind tour. Through him I see the magic of the place and the unbroken seafaring traditions that still pull the strings. We finish at sunset in his rooftop restaurant, with a stunning view across the port and all the way to the Parthenon, lit up on its distant hill.</p> <p>Next morning I am at gate two on the quayside, where boarding is quick, efficient and not at all chaotic. Most people on the boat are going to Mykonos, but I am staying on to a lesser-known island: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/ikaria-greece-longevity-secrets-age\" title=\"\">Ikaria, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/ikaria-greece-longevity-secrets-age\" title=\"\">which has a reputation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/ikaria-greece-longevity-secrets-age\" title=\"\">for its inhabitants living to fabulous old age</a>. It was also, I read on the ferry deck, a place of exile for 16,000 communists after the second world war. Maybe I can weave these two themes together? As I tuck into a spinach and cheese pie, this foreknowledge gives me a sense of relief: the first chapter of my own odyssey is already shaping up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c4e74e0bb9f75f33252a8393472cf08ceea26d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c4e74e0bb9f75f33252a8393472cf08ceea26d5/0_63_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the waterfront \u2026 the port at Evdilos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the waterfront \u2026 the port at Evdilos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seven hours later I am sitting in a cafe in one of Ikaria\u2019s two ports. Evdilos is a smartly painted village on a steep mountain slope covered in oaks and plumes of pink oleanders. My guide is Urania, local artist and travel agent, who walks me up through the village\u2019s shady lanes and then back to a cafe by the sea.</p> <p>\u201cAsk me anything,\u201d she says, ordering iced coffees and local cakes, \u201cexcept \u2013 please \u2013 nothing about longevity.\u201d It transpires that a couple of newspaper articles on the Ikarian age phenomenon triggered a deadly deluge of outsiders, all pestering anyone with half a wrinkle to cough up the secret of long life.</p> <p>\u201cAt first we were all very polite,\u201d Urania says. \u201cI even arranged for one American channel to film a 97-year-old having breakfast, but when he rolled a cigarette, the director went crazy, shouting that it was all wrong. Now the old people refuse to tell their age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in longevity,\u201d I assure her, inwardly cursing.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says, cutting up the cakes for us to share. \u201cThe other subject to avoid is the communist stuff, but that wouldn\u2019t interest you, would it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d34a6e4c9a3ad31071e18a770d9e08b01bf2031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d34a6e4c9a3ad31071e18a770d9e08b01bf2031/0_0_960_960/500.jpg\" alt=\"a healthy plate of horiatiki on Ikaria\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We eat a lot of greens\u2019 \u2026 a healthy plate on Ikaria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thea's Inn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, Urania\u2019s husband, Theo, gives me a lift to my hotel, the family-run Erofili up the coast in the village of Armenistis. I swim, then go for dinner at local restaurant <a href=\"https://marymaryikaria.com/\" title=\"\">Mary Mary</a>, where Nikos, the owner, recommends the traditional Ikaria pie, filled with mixed greens, and <em>soufiko</em>.</p> <p>\u201cWe eat lots of greens,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSoufiko is really just a mixture of what you have in the garden.\u201d Nikos adds twists to such simple traditions, making superbly tasty dishes. His long-term ambition, however, belies this sophistication: he plans to retire to a smallholding up on the mountain. \u201cI\u2019ll keep chickens, grow vegetables and make cheese.\u201d</p> <p>Next day Urania and I drive up into the hills, and into the trees. Ikaria is a green island, and for centuries most of the population lived away from the coast. The old stone houses, some still inhabited, all face away from the sea, a relic of the time when pirates would roam the Aegean, looking for settlements to raid. In Christos Raches, the population went one step further, working their fields by night to avoid piratical attention. It still retains some of that nocturnal habit: its beautiful shady square is surrounded by tavernas, and at its liveliest after midnight. All around are oak forests and deep gorges dotted with waterfalls.</p> <p>On a nearby hillside, local pharmacist Nikos Afianes is developing a <a href=\"https://www.afianeswines.gr/eshop/en\" title=\"\">vineyard and winery</a> that also harks back to Ikaria\u2019s past. \u201cWhen I started, people told me that the soil was acidic, totally unsuitable for vines,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I knew that in ancient times the island was famous for its wine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4572e74a8db3b17ec7f7060e34a5c63bf18a9d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4572e74a8db3b17ec7f7060e34a5c63bf18a9d9c/0_485_6142_3685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nikos Afianes in his vineyard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nikos Afianes in his vineyard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nikos has dedicated a lifetime to researching this paradox, and rediscovered ancient Greek methods and materials. \u201cWe grow forgotten varieties, then ferment the wine in amphora buried in the earth using local strains of yeast.\u201d</p> <p>The result is organic wines that have won plaudits from both wine connoisseurs and archaeologists. We sit in Nikos\u2019s vineyard, opening bottles. The white begleri is my favourite: its amber colour threatens sweetness, but the wine is as dry as flint, with a rolling symphony of flavours. I notice a clump of trees on a small hill and ask what it is.</p> <p>\u201cOur village cemetery,\u201d says Nikos, offering to take me to see it. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting place.\u201d</p> <p>When we arrive, I immediately see why.

      "bodyText": "The bustle of the port is exhilarating: ship\u2019s horns booming, sailors shouting, swarms of taxis on the quaysides. If a shot of adrenaline is required before any island-hopping adventure, Piraeus provides. I park myself in a kafeneio for an hour and drink in \u2013 with some bitter Greek coffee \u2013 the sheer excitement of travel in a place where millions of odysseys have begun. When it comes to Greek island hopping, I really thought I\u2019d missed the boat. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen it 30 years ago: it\u2019s not the same now,\u201d people had been telling me, along with tales of ferry chaos, rip-off prices and the blight of mass tourism. But now I\u2019m in Piraeus, 10km south-west of central Athens, and it feels right. I\u2019m going to what I hope are out-of-the-way islands \u2013 Ikaria, Kalymnos, Amorgos, Folegandros, Milos and Sifnos \u2013 each with a unique character. A great loop of seafaring will, over the next few weeks, take me across the Aegean Sea and back here. But first I have a night in the port. I wander up to my hotel, The Alex, and discover that it has opened that very day. I am its first-ever guest. Konstantinos, the excited owner, is bent on proving that Piraeus is a worthy stopover and takes me on a whirlwind tour. Through him I see the magic of the place and the unbroken seafaring traditions that still pull the strings. We finish at sunset in his rooftop restaurant, with a stunning view across the port and all the way to the Parthenon, lit up on its distant hill. Next morning I am at gate two on the quayside, where boarding is quick, efficient and not at all chaotic. Most people on the boat are going to Mykonos, but I am staying on to a lesser-known island: Ikaria, which has a reputation for its inhabitants living to fabulous old age. It was also, I read on the ferry deck, a place of exile for 16,000 communists after the second world war. Maybe I can weave these two themes together? As I tuck into a spinach and cheese pie, this foreknowledge gives me a sense of relief: the first chapter of my own odyssey is already shaping up. Seven hours later I am sitting in a cafe in one of Ikaria\u2019s two ports. Evdilos is a smartly painted village on a steep mountain slope covered in oaks and plumes of pink oleanders. My guide is Urania, local artist and travel agent, who walks me up through the village\u2019s shady lanes and then back to a cafe by the sea. \u201cAsk me anything,\u201d she says, ordering iced coffees and local cakes, \u201cexcept \u2013 please \u2013 nothing about longevity.\u201d It transpires that a couple of newspaper articles on the Ikarian age phenomenon triggered a deadly deluge of outsiders, all pestering anyone with half a wrinkle to cough up the secret of long life. \u201cAt first we were all very polite,\u201d Urania says. \u201cI even arranged for one American channel to film a 97-year-old having breakfast, but when he rolled a cigarette, the director went crazy, shouting that it was all wrong. Now the old people refuse to tell their age.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not interested in longevity,\u201d I assure her, inwardly cursing. \u201cGood,\u201d she says, cutting up the cakes for us to share. \u201cThe other subject to avoid is the communist stuff, but that wouldn\u2019t interest you, would it?\u201d \u201cNot at all.\u201d Later, Urania\u2019s husband, Theo, gives me a lift to my hotel, the family-run Erofili up the coast in the village of Armenistis. I swim, then go for dinner at local restaurant Mary Mary, where Nikos, the owner, recommends the traditional Ikaria pie, filled with mixed greens, and soufiko. \u201cWe eat lots of greens,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSoufiko is really just a mixture of what you have in the garden.\u201d Nikos adds twists to such simple traditions, making superbly tasty dishes. His long-term ambition, however, belies this sophistication: he plans to retire to a smallholding up on the mountain. \u201cI\u2019ll keep chickens, grow vegetables and make cheese.\u201d Next day Urania and I drive up into the hills, and into the trees. Ikaria is a green island, and for centuries most of the population lived away from the coast. The old stone houses, some still inhabited, all face away from the sea, a relic of the time when pirates would roam the Aegean, looking for settlements to raid. In Christos Raches, the population went one step further, working their fields by night to avoid piratical attention. It still retains some of that nocturnal habit: its beautiful shady square is surrounded by tavernas, and at its liveliest after midnight. All around are oak forests and deep gorges dotted with waterfalls. On a nearby hillside, local pharmacist Nikos Afianes is developing a vineyard and winery that also harks back to Ikaria\u2019s past. \u201cWhen I started, people told me that the soil was acidic, totally unsuitable for vines,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I knew that in ancient times the island was famous for its wine.\u201d Nikos has dedicated a lifetime to researching this paradox, and rediscovered ancient Greek methods and materials. \u201cWe grow forgotten varieties, then ferment the wine in amphora buried in the earth using local strains of yeast.\u201d The result is organic wines that have won plaudits from both wine connoisseurs and archaeologists. We sit in Nikos\u2019s vineyard, opening bottles. The white begleri is my favourite: its amber colour threatens sweetness, but the wine is as dry as flint, with a rolling symphony of flavours. I notice a clump of trees on a small hill and ask what it is. \u201cOur village cemetery,\u201d says Nikos, offering to take me to see it. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting place.\u201d When we arrive, I immediately see why. Each gravestone is marked with dates, many with the age of the deceased. I read: 99, 88, 79, 88, 97, and then I stop. Born 1856. Died 1982. That makes 126. Nikos is further down the line, shaking his head. \u201cOnly 70. Tragic. So young.\u201d At the gate, he leaves me with two facts. \u201cThe soil stress on the vines means our wines have very high levels of resveratrol. Also, we use wild yeasts that yield beta-glucans.\u201d I go away and look these terms up. Resveratrol has been associated with longevity claims; and beta-glucans have been found to reduce cholesterol. Drinking Ikarian wine, it seems, does keep you young and fit. That evening Urania and I finish up at a panegyri, a local celebration, held under huge ancient trees in the last golden rays of sunlight. We take trays the size of tables and load up with psiti (roast meat), prothesi (goat soup), horiatiki (salad) and longevity juice (wine). I\u2019m introduced to the local sea captain and others.

How, for goodness sake, can Whitehall officials, with the best will in the world, make this crazy no-deal scenario work properly?</p> <p>Treasury officials have not been the flavour of the year with a government apparently dead set on heading for the Brexit cliff. Why? Because they have been warning of the catastrophic consequences of \u201cno deal\u201d \u2013 not to say of the somewhat less catastrophic consequences of <em>any </em>Brexit deal \u2013 hard, soft or in-between.</p> <p>Recently, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/18/no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-britain-into-a-recession-says-obr\" title=\"\">added to the warnings</a>. Even on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s \u201cless pessimistic\u201d no-deal Brexit scenario, the OBR sees damaging consequences for household incomes, the public finances and the pound.</p> <p>In which latter context, it is worth emphasising that the uncertainty that followed the referendum \u2013 and the huge hit to business confidence \u2013 has meant that the traditional boost to investment and exports (and import saving) from a devaluation has been conspicuous by its absence. The trade balance is terrible. The collapse of confidence in the pound has been bad news for most of us.</p> <p>The plain fact of the matter is that Brexit <em>is</em> crazy and our latest prime minister must know it.</p> <p>Now, while he was in the course of losing the race against Johnson, Jeremy Hunt was foolish enough to move to the ultra-right, no-deal fringe and complain that \u201cthe EU has deliberately chosen to make the UK poorer\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps he really is deluded and believes that a period of 'optimism' can work miracles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sorry? Who has chosen to make the UK poorer? Not the famous 17 million who voted Leave in the referendum without being informed of the consequences, let alone the lies. No, it is the Conservative party, under the leadership first of Theresa May, and now of Alexander Johnson. This once-great party subscribes to a policy of self-harm for the economy while fantasising about arranging a handful of trade deals that would in no way compensate for the (70) perfectly satisfactory trade deals we already have with, or via, the EU and which would be sacrificed by heading for the 31 October cliff.</p> <p>There have been times when mistaken economic policies have harmed our economy \u2013 the sado-monetarism of the early 1980s, and the Osborne austerity programme since 2010. There have been times when \u201cevents\u201d have caused serious disruption \u2013 the second world war and its aftermath necessitated an austerity programme until the wartime economy adjusted to peacetime; and the oil-shock of 1973-74, when oil prices rose fivefold, was what economists call an \u201cexternal shock\u201d. It aggravated the British economy\u2019s inflationary tendencies, leading to the collapse of the Heath Conservative government of 1970-74 and the Wilson-Callaghan Labour government of 1974-79.</p> <p>But deliberately choosing to cause harm to the economy and society is something else. And that is what is coming unless the country has a chance to think again, the only feasible route being another referendum \u2013 the second or third, depending how you score the 1975 referendum which confirmed our original membership.</p> <p>There is no shortage of speculation about what Johnson and his cohorts are up to \u2013 and I did not get where I am today by trying to read politicians\u2019 minds. There are those who say that Johnson is at heart a Remainer, and is going through the motions of pretending to believe in Brexit until it becomes obvious that it is nonsense and normal service can be resumed. But perhaps he really is deluded and believes that a period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/jul/24/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-in-full-video\" title=\"\">\u201coptimism\u201d</a> \u2013 after the period of low spirits, even depression, fomented largely by him and his Brexit like \u2013 can work miracles.</p> <p>There is only one macroeconomic sphere in which I agree with him. After a long period of needless austerity, the economy needs more expansionary, Keynesian policies. However, focusing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnsons-tax-cut-would-benefit-richest-10-most-say-experts\" title=\"\">tax cuts on the rich </a>is not the right way to cure the many ills of contemporary society.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018While we were strongly opposed to the Trotskyist revolution that has taken place in this country, now that it has occurred the important thing is that it should be made to work properly.\u201d It was on something like those lines that a few of us wrote a parody of a Financial Times leading article many years ago on a very slow news day, when I was working for the FT. There haven\u2019t been many slow news days since the June 2016 referendum; but the memory of that FT parody has come back to me in the light of the elevation to prime minister of the (at the time of writing ) United Kingdom of you know who. Another memory is of a senior civil servant saying to me during the disastrous monetarist period of early Thatcherism: \u201cMinisters do crazy things: my job is to see that they do crazy things properly\u201d (or words to that effect). How, for goodness sake, can Whitehall officials, with the best will in the world, make this crazy no-deal scenario work properly? Treasury officials have not been the flavour of the year with a government apparently dead set on heading for the Brexit cliff. Why? Because they have been warning of the catastrophic consequences of \u201cno deal\u201d \u2013 not to say of the somewhat less catastrophic consequences of any Brexit deal \u2013 hard, soft or in-between. Recently, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has added to the warnings. Even on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s \u201cless pessimistic\u201d no-deal Brexit scenario, the OBR sees damaging consequences for household incomes, the public finances and the pound. In which latter context, it is worth emphasising that the uncertainty that followed the referendum \u2013 and the huge hit to business confidence \u2013 has meant that the traditional boost to investment and exports (and import saving) from a devaluation has been conspicuous by its absence. The trade balance is terrible. The collapse of confidence in the pound has been bad news for most of us. The plain fact of the matter is that Brexit is crazy and our latest prime minister must know it. Now, while he was in the course of losing the race against Johnson, Jeremy Hunt was foolish enough to move to the ultra-right, no-deal fringe and complain that \u201cthe EU has deliberately chosen to make the UK poorer\u201d. Sorry? Who has chosen to make the UK poorer? Not the famous 17 million who voted Leave in the referendum without being informed of the consequences, let alone the lies. No, it is the Conservative party, under the leadership first of Theresa May, and now of Alexander Johnson. This once-great party subscribes to a policy of self-harm for the economy while fantasising about arranging a handful of trade deals that would in no way compensate for the (70) perfectly satisfactory trade deals we already have with, or via, the EU and which would be sacrificed by heading for the 31 October cliff. There have been times when mistaken economic policies have harmed our economy \u2013 the sado-monetarism of the early 1980s, and the Osborne austerity programme since 2010. There have been times when \u201cevents\u201d have caused serious disruption \u2013 the second world war and its aftermath necessitated an austerity programme until the wartime economy adjusted to peacetime; and the oil-shock of 1973-74, when oil prices rose fivefold, was what economists call an \u201cexternal shock\u201d. It aggravated the British economy\u2019s inflationary tendencies, leading to the collapse of the Heath Conservative government of 1970-74 and the Wilson-Callaghan Labour government of 1974-79. But deliberately choosing to cause harm to the economy and society is something else. And that is what is coming unless the country has a chance to think again, the only feasible route being another referendum \u2013 the second or third, depending how you score the 1975 referendum which confirmed our original membership. There is no shortage of speculation about what Johnson and his cohorts are up to \u2013 and I did not get where I am today by trying to read politicians\u2019 minds. There are those who say that Johnson is at heart a Remainer, and is going through the motions of pretending to believe in Brexit until it becomes obvious that it is nonsense and normal service can be resumed. But perhaps he really is deluded and believes that a period of \u201coptimism\u201d \u2013 after the period of low spirits, even depression, fomented largely by him and his Brexit like \u2013 can work miracles. There is only one macroeconomic sphere in which I agree with him. After a long period of needless austerity, the economy needs more expansionary, Keynesian policies. However, focusing tax cuts on the rich is not the right way to cure the many ills of contemporary society.",

Husband Adam has a bit of a petty moue going on when he mildly chides hairdresser Nicola about going to the pub to celebrate an unimportant birthday for a colleague. \u201cSee them at work anyway all day, don\u2019t you?\u201d he milds. I\u2019m sure I was not alone in screaming: \u201cThat\u2019s not the <em>point</em>, you cloth-brained tojo.\u201d</p> <p>Fact sadly is, Adam must have known it wasn\u2019t the point. At all. He was, in fact, rather self-aware \u2013 aware enough to be able to know after he\u2019d made the mistake, say, of criticising her wearing leggings to the gym (\u201cWho\u2019s that for then?\u201d) of accepting he might be a teensy bit jealous. But \u201cit just worries me\u2026 I love you <em>so</em> much\u201d. Seemingly mollified, Nicola smiles, and lets herself be kissed again. It is only afterwards we feel the temple throbbing, feel the iron band drawing round the head.</p> <p>Vicky McClure as Nicola has a face and body that can thrum with tension even when doing so little as moving from sofa to chair, from bedroom to rest her head against a cool basin, just to escape the relentless padding little-dog-lost passive entreaties of the boy-man she\u2019d married.</p> <p>It was all, of course, about coercion, the passive-aggressive coercion of the male provider, damned for his entitlement down many centuries in literature yet still phenomenally unaware. Not that Adam was a bully; violence was never overt, yet menace always was. Chiefly the menace that he might start bloody crying again.</p> <p>This creation of Dominic Savage, co-authored and developed with McClure, was a terrifyingly subtle, understated, mainly improvised slice of skilful televisual drama. The result of hundreds of hours of preparation, the dialogue felt fresh as none other can.</p> <p>McClure was, naturally, pitch-perfect as the lass who kids herself nothing\u2019s wrong except a niggling home boredom. There are no great epiphanies, only a slow realisation that Adam (a superb find in McClure\u2019s old friend Perry Fitzpatrick) is jealous to the point of psychopathy. The crux, if there is one, comes when she allows herself the nearest to an honest rant, to be greeted with a stubborn, denying: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t really see where you\u2019re coming from. I think it\u2019s just a little bit silly\u2026 haven\u2019t got time for it, if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d He doesn\u2019t notice her muttered, dark, presumably improvised: \u201cNeither do I.\u201d When she finally escapes to a family garden, her smile is as if the sun has come out. Two more in this series of one-off stories with other female leads to come: dark and chewy subjects, rendered with immense quality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f141a0f3ad7c00af1bf7d9d66b07fde7df857e1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f141a0f3ad7c00af1bf7d9d66b07fde7df857e1f/0_35_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blanca (Laura G\u00f3mez) and Taystee (Tasha Jefferson) in Orange Is the New Black.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lest we forget\u2026 Blanca (Laura G\u00f3mez) and Taystee (Tasha Jefferson) in Orange Is the New Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cara Howe/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Changes of scene all round in three series that have made an extremely welcome return.

Its origins were close to the postal DVD-by-delivery days, now a near-impossible concept to get one\u2019s enfeebled brain round, and, still, it seems a remarkably percipient headliner, introducing so many themes \u2013 race, feminism, victimhood, identity, gender \u2013 that would come to dominate the culture wars of this second decade. It just so happened to be set in a women\u2019s prison.</p> <p>The opener is tremendous. Piper\u2019s out of prison, but hardly loving it; it\u2019s a trope often done before, but seldom better. Taystee, wrongly now tagged a lifer, has lost every spark. More than any preceding series this, still, is essentially about women\u2019s friendships, bitternesses, vicious vicissitudes, but you also get, increasingly, a sense of the savage atrophying of simple bloody <em>time</em> on the incarcerated. I hope the newest Netflix employees will have to walk daily past a plaque of remembrance to this show: lest they forget.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4246f6e7295b1665385a520b8c8b4e2c67e06cd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4246f6e7295b1665385a520b8c8b4e2c67e06cd3/0_0_4372_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eve Myles in Keeping Faith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eve Myles in the \u2018turbo-pimped\u2019 Keeping Faith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Taylor/BBC/Vox Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09s7357\" title=\"\"><strong>Keeping Faith</strong></a>, a runaway word-of-internet hit when it launched on S4C in late 2017, now interestingly has its own female star, Eve Myles, as exec-producer. Welsh-set, with all that might entail both good and bad \u2013 drink, rain, drugs, busybodies, vicious boatyards and scrapyards, but also tremendous community goodwill, looking out for each other, the long, steady process of feeding three growing children, one a newly pupated goth.</p> <p>Above all, it\u2019s Myles\u2019s tour de force. I look at her juggling three children, a mortgage, a jailed husband, her solicitor\u2019s job, the conflicting small-p politics of small-town life and am simply exhausted. How does she do all this with a cheeky smile planted on her face?</p> <p>A thoroughly welcome return, although, with this second series, Faith Howells does appear to have planted her electric-blue heels rather firmly on <em>Broadchurch</em> territory. In a way, it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s been turbo-pimped by the BBC. It could only be discovered before on the iPlayer or BBC Wales, and indeed was co-shot in the Welsh language and thus felt like a grand chance to see a rather singular part of Britain. Whereas the mainstreaming now has those blue heels firmly accessorised with a sexy raincoat \u2013 you can tell they\u2019re hoping to \u201ciconise\u201d that as with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/feb/21/jumper-is-star-the-killing\" title=\"\">Sarah Lund\u2019s sweater</a> \u2013 and, as opposed to the intrigue of an awol\u2019d hubby, we\u2019re in the relatively mundane hunt to clear a (presumably) innocent wife of murder. For all that, there was very, very little actively wrong with <em>Broadchurch</em>, and something tells me there are many squirrelly twists lurking amid those Carmarthen dunes over the next six weeks.</p> <p>I tried my own word-of-mouthing months ago to promote Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80192098\" title=\"\"><strong>Money Heist</strong></a>, pushing it to No 5 on my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/30/euan-ferguson-best-television-tv-2018\" title=\"\">Top 10 telly of 2018</a>. I was thus delighted both at its return for a third series and the realisation that my faith had not been misplaced.</p> <p>It too, however, looks to have been somewhat a victim of its own success. Whereas parts one and two were almost exclusively confined to Madrid\u2019s Royal Mint \u2013 hostages, death, quite tremendous and un-CGI\u2019d action sequences, thrilling direction, weird yet entirely credible alliances \u2013 the gang and their \u201cprofessor\u201d have now escaped, with the vast moolah (hurrah), to all corners of the Earth.</p> <p>We take a little kind time to re-establish the personalities, and then one is, of course, nabbed, two years later. (If you can\u2019t trust a dodgy Cairo backstreet sleaze thief to sell you a knock-off satphone and keep shtum to Interpol, what\u2019s the world, etc?) So the stage is set for a rescue and, in its new improved budgetary guise, it has already travelled to the Caribbean, Thailand and points exotic: they\u2019re spending oodles now (and not just the gang).</p> <p>One of the supreme strengths of the series is to portray with honesty what is, in essence, an angry and unflinchingly violent handful of souls and imbue them with wit, bonding, indeed the capacity for love. Despite the loosened purse-strings, none of the essentially claustrophobic atmosphere has been shed: it\u2019s still a glorious <em>Peaky Blinders</em>, just with tapas and subtitles.</p>",

Husband Adam has a bit of a petty moue going on when he mildly chides hairdresser Nicola about going to the pub to celebrate an unimportant birthday for a colleague. \u201cSee them at work anyway all day, don\u2019t you?\u201d he milds. I\u2019m sure I was not alone in screaming: \u201cThat\u2019s not the point, you cloth-brained tojo.\u201d Fact sadly is, Adam must have known it wasn\u2019t the point. At all. He was, in fact, rather self-aware \u2013 aware enough to be able to know after he\u2019d made the mistake, say, of criticising her wearing leggings to the gym (\u201cWho\u2019s that for then?\u201d) of accepting he might be a teensy bit jealous. But \u201cit just worries me\u2026 I love you so much\u201d. Seemingly mollified, Nicola smiles, and lets herself be kissed again. It is only afterwards we feel the temple throbbing, feel the iron band drawing round the head. Vicky McClure as Nicola has a face and body that can thrum with tension even when doing so little as moving from sofa to chair, from bedroom to rest her head against a cool basin, just to escape the relentless padding little-dog-lost passive entreaties of the boy-man she\u2019d married. It was all, of course, about coercion, the passive-aggressive coercion of the male provider, damned for his entitlement down many centuries in literature yet still phenomenally unaware. Not that Adam was a bully; violence was never overt, yet menace always was. Chiefly the menace that he might start bloody crying again. This creation of Dominic Savage, co-authored and developed with McClure, was a terrifyingly subtle, understated, mainly improvised slice of skilful televisual drama. The result of hundreds of hours of preparation, the dialogue felt fresh as none other can. McClure was, naturally, pitch-perfect as the lass who kids herself nothing\u2019s wrong except a niggling home boredom. There are no great epiphanies, only a slow realisation that Adam (a superb find in McClure\u2019s old friend Perry Fitzpatrick) is jealous to the point of psychopathy. The crux, if there is one, comes when she allows herself the nearest to an honest rant, to be greeted with a stubborn, denying: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t really see where you\u2019re coming from. I think it\u2019s just a little bit silly\u2026 haven\u2019t got time for it, if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d He doesn\u2019t notice her muttered, dark, presumably improvised: \u201cNeither do I.\u201d When she finally escapes to a family garden, her smile is as if the sun has come out. Two more in this series of one-off stories with other female leads to come: dark and chewy subjects, rendered with immense quality. Changes of scene all round in three series that have made an extremely welcome return. Sadly it\u2019s going to be the last ever Orange Is the New Black, now Netflix\u2019s longest-running show. Its origins were close to the postal DVD-by-delivery days, now a near-impossible concept to get one\u2019s enfeebled brain round, and, still, it seems a remarkably percipient headliner, introducing so many themes \u2013 race, feminism, victimhood, identity, gender \u2013 that would come to dominate the culture wars of this second decade. It just so happened to be set in a women\u2019s prison. The opener is tremendous. Piper\u2019s out of prison, but hardly loving it; it\u2019s a trope often done before, but seldom better. Taystee, wrongly now tagged a lifer, has lost every spark. More than any preceding series this, still, is essentially about women\u2019s friendships, bitternesses, vicious vicissitudes, but you also get, increasingly, a sense of the savage atrophying of simple bloody time on the incarcerated. I hope the newest Netflix employees will have to walk daily past a plaque of remembrance to this show: lest they forget. Keeping Faith, a runaway word-of-internet hit when it launched on S4C in late 2017, now interestingly has its own female star, Eve Myles, as exec-producer. Welsh-set, with all that might entail both good and bad \u2013 drink, rain, drugs, busybodies, vicious boatyards and scrapyards, but also tremendous community goodwill, looking out for each other, the long, steady process of feeding three growing children, one a newly pupated goth. Above all, it\u2019s Myles\u2019s tour de force. I look at her juggling three children, a mortgage, a jailed husband, her solicitor\u2019s job, the conflicting small-p politics of small-town life and am simply exhausted. How does she do all this with a cheeky smile planted on her face? A thoroughly welcome return, although, with this second series, Faith Howells does appear to have planted her electric-blue heels rather firmly on Broadchurch territory. In a way, it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s been turbo-pimped by the BBC. It could only be discovered before on the iPlayer or BBC Wales, and indeed was co-shot in the Welsh language and thus felt like a grand chance to see a rather singular part of Britain. Whereas the mainstreaming now has those blue heels firmly accessorised with a sexy raincoat \u2013 you can tell they\u2019re hoping to \u201ciconise\u201d that as with Sarah Lund\u2019s sweater \u2013 and, as opposed to the intrigue of an awol\u2019d hubby, we\u2019re in the relatively mundane hunt to clear a (presumably) innocent wife of murder. For all that, there was very, very little actively wrong with Broadchurch, and something tells me there are many squirrelly twists lurking amid those Carmarthen dunes over the next six weeks. I tried my own word-of-mouthing months ago to promote Netflix\u2019s Money Heist, pushing it to No 5 on my Top 10 telly of 2018. I was thus delighted both at its return for a third series and the realisation that my faith had not been misplaced. It too, however, looks to have been somewhat a victim of its own success. Whereas parts one and two were almost exclusively confined to Madrid\u2019s Royal Mint \u2013 hostages, death, quite tremendous and un-CGI\u2019d action sequences, thrilling direction, weird yet entirely credible alliances \u2013 the gang and their \u201cprofessor\u201d have now escaped, with the vast moolah (hurrah), to all corners of the Earth. We take a little kind time to re-establish the personalities, and then one is, of course, nabbed, two years later. (If you can\u2019t trust a dodgy Cairo backstreet sleaze thief to sell you a knock-off satphone and keep shtum to Interpol, what\u2019s the world, etc?) So the stage is set for a rescue and, in its new improved budgetary guise, it has already travelled to the Caribbean, Thailand and points exotic: they\u2019re spending oodles now (and not just the gang). One of the supreme strengths of the series is to portray with honesty what is, in essence, an angry and unflinchingly violent handful of souls and imbue them with wit, bonding, indeed the capacity for love. Despite the loosened purse-strings, none of the essentially claustrophobic atmosphere has been shed: it\u2019s still a glorious Peaky Blinders, just with tapas and subtitles.",

Authoritarian regimes adore it. And, of course, police forces are fascinated by it, not least because it provides them with \u201cobjective\u201d grounds for stop and search. There are, however, some problems with this corporate and authoritarian tool. One is that the technology itself is flaky, prone to errors, false positives and bias. More importantly, it is a pathologically intrusive, privacy-eroding technology that can be used for general surveillance in combination with public video cameras. And in those applications it doesn\u2019t require the knowledge, consent or participation of the subject. It can \u2013 and will \u2013 be used to create general, suspicionless surveillance systems: Jeremy Bentham\u2019s panopticon on steroids. Imagine a public space \u2013 Trafalgar Square or Oxford Street, say \u2013 thronged with people and monitored by CCTV cameras linked to a facial-recognition machine. Every time a camera focuses on a face, superimposed on the person\u2019s visage is his or her name, plus other information about them \u2013 nationality, age, visa status, educational qualifications, criminal convictions (if any), employment history, political party. This is not science fiction. It\u2019s possible and working now in some parts of the world, notably China. And it\u2019s what has led some people to liken the technology to plutonium and others to call for an outright ban on it. We now have two options for controlling this runaway technology. One is to treat it like plutonium and ban its use for civilian purposes. The other is to treat it like a radioactive isotope \u2013 which has important uses in medicine \u2013 and regulate it accordingly. Oddly enough, this is what Microsoft suggests, arguing for \u201ca government initiative to regulate the proper use of facial-recognition technology, informed first by a bipartisan and expert commission\u201d. When one of the tech giants starts to argue for government regulation, then you know we have really got a problem. What I\u2019m reading FaceApp to the facts There\u2019s a nice story in Wired about the FaceApp hoo-ha and its wider contradictions. Why are we more worried about a single Russian-authored app than we are about Facebook? Data with destiny Stanford University sociologist Michael Rosenfeld and colleagues have produced a fascinating study on how dating apps have \u201cdisintermediated\u201d (ie replaced) friends and family as the links to future life partners. Visionary stuff \u201cAn image sensor isn\u2019t a \u2018camera\u2019 that takes \u2018photos\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a way to let computers see.\u201d Read the thoughtful blog post by Benedict Evans on why computer vision is changing what machines can do.",

He didn\u2019t look at the judge or the lawyers as they discussed his case. He\u2019d picked up a cold, and occasionally would sneeze.</p> <p>When the hearing began, Bretado argued that Jos\u00e9 should be disqualified from the Remain in Mexico program, and allowed to be with his family. She submitted Jos\u00e9\u2019s recently conducted medical evaluation, and spelled out the situation in plain language.</p> <p>\u201cOn 8 May his cognitive disability issue was put on the record,\u201d Bretado said.</p> <p>\u201cHe has now been returned to Mexico twice.

It was an important step, but just one in an increasingly confusing system. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f93e642ebba8120635123523ccf8d93d620d6863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93e642ebba8120635123523ccf8d93d620d6863/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carmen, Maria, Kevin, Rosa and Antonio hug during a family portrait.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen, Maria, Kevin, Rosa and Antonio hug during a family portrait.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Andrew/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the hearing, Jos\u00e9 was taken into US custody so the examination could take place. He was held for three days, but then abruptly sent back to the Buen Pastor shelter. Jos\u00e9 later managed to tell his lawyer he had been teased by officials while in custody. They had told him he would be sent to a mental asylum, Jos\u00e9 said, away from his mother. When he got back to the shelter, he was upset and scared.</p> <p>Back in Virginia, Jos\u00e9\u2019s family knew none of this, because he hadn\u2019t been able to call them while in custody. The first update they, and Jos\u00e9\u2019s lawyer, had on his case after he went back to Mexico most recently, was when they got a call from Buen Pastor shelter. After all the hope that Jos\u00e9 would be reunited with his mother and family, he instead continues to wait there, hoping for an update to emerge from the Kafkaesque immigration court system.</p> <p>It remains unclear what will happen to Jos\u00e9. Under the ever-shifting immigration policies of the Trump administration, few can predict what will happen next.</p> <p>He might be ordered to remain in Mexico for an asylum hearing, months from now. He might be detained on the US side of the border. Jos\u00e9\u2019s family hope he will be allowed to enter the US to be with them while his case is processed, but there is no predicting when that might happen.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a blessing. It\u2019s the thing we want the most,\u201d Maria, Jos\u00e9\u2019s sister, told the Guardian.</p> <p>For now, the family are forced to wait in limbo. They held a birthday party for Jos\u00e9 in June, and he has a space ready to sleep in Rosa\u2019s apartment. On Thursday, Tapia helped them Skype with Jos\u00e9 for the first time since he was stranded in Mexico. Everyone was in tears as they waved at each other down the phone, 3,000 miles apart.</p> <p>\u201cI have five children and four of them are here,\u201d Rosa said, after saying goodbye to her son.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all together now. He\u2019s the only one who is not here.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On 30 March, Jos\u00e9 arrived in El Paso, Texas, after a weeks-long journey from his home in El Salvador. The 27-year-old had traveled with his cousin and her son, escaping relentless gang violence back home. Like thousands of migrants arriving before them, under the Trump administration they were forcibly separated by the authorities after crossing the US-Mexico border. After being detained and questioned, Jos\u00e9 handed over a clutch of documents to the officials, before being ordered back to Mexico, under a recently instated Trump administration policy. Among the papers that Jos\u00e9, now alone, had given to the officials was a statement from his doctor, back in El Salvador. It said that Jos\u00e9 had the cognitive age of a four-year-old child. Since the Trump government implemented the so-called Remain in Mexico, or Migrant Protection Protocols policy, in March, tens of thousands of people have been sent back to Mexico after arriving at the border to apply for asylum. They are told to wait there, sometimes for months at a time, before returning to the US for a court hearing. But while they wait in Mexican border towns, families and individuals have become the targets of gangs and criminals. People have been extorted, raped and killed in the crowded towns along the border, while many have been forced to sleep on the streets as charity-run shelters have become overcrowded. Jos\u00e9 was held in a detention center in El Paso for two weeks before being loaded on to a bus and sent to Juarez. There he stayed with people he had met in the shelter before finding his way \u2013 Jos\u00e9 is unable to explain how \u2013 to the Buen Pastor shelter, a 10-minute drive south-west from the bridge that links Juarez with El Paso. By that time it had been almost three weeks since he had been separated from his 30-year-old cousin Malene, who had been his main caretaker in El Salvador, and her 13-year-old son, Jonathan, who describes Jos\u00e9 as \u201clike a brother\u201d. Jos\u00e9\u2019s family had no idea where he was, and his mother, Rosa, who lives in Virginia, has been unable to sleep through worry. \u201cI was really shocked, really surprised. I didn\u2019t expect him to be left alone,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cI thought: \u2018How can they do that?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it had happened.\u201d Rosa spoke to the Guardian at her home in suburban Virginia, a 40-minute drive south from Washington DC. A gold-framed photo of Jos\u00e9, her son posing on one knee, gazing into the camera, was sitting on a glass table next to Rosa\u2019s sofa. Rosa said she hadn\u2019t been able to sleep through worrying for Jos\u00e9. She wept as she spoke about her son.

And laugh, and be together. He has no evil in his heart.\u201d Volunteers at Buen Pastor helped Jos\u00e9 to contact his mother and his brothers and sisters, who had already made the journey north to the US. But with Jos\u00e9 stuck in the opaque immigration legal system, they were powerless to help. He had been living at the shelter for six weeks before his situation was noticed, by chance, by immigration advocates in El Paso\u2019s immigration court. Jos\u00e9 had been summoned to court on 8 May, and once there it was clear he could not understand the judge or prosecution. He is able to tell people his name, and the names of some family members, but is unaware of his date of birth or age \u2013 or where he is. Immigration advocates in court flagged Jos\u00e9\u2019s lack of comprehension with officials, but it didn\u2019t make a difference.

Rosa described a different person to the shy man the Guardian had met in Juarez a week earlier. She remembered Jos\u00e9 as being happy and carefree in El Salvador. \u201cJos\u00e9 enjoyed going out with his grandfather, out in the fields,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would not really help much, but he would just joke around and, like, throw seeds or pick up things, scare the birds away and he would laugh. He was playing.\u201d On 18 July, Bretado accompanied Jos\u00e9 to court, for a pivotal hearing. With his new test results in hand, the hope was that he could be released into the US. Jos\u00e9 sat next to Bretado, occasionally glancing around the courtroom. He didn\u2019t look at the judge or the lawyers as they discussed his case. He\u2019d picked up a cold, and occasionally would sneeze. When the hearing began, Bretado argued that Jos\u00e9 should be disqualified from the Remain in Mexico program, and allowed to be with his family. She submitted Jos\u00e9\u2019s recently conducted medical evaluation, and spelled out the situation in plain language. \u201cOn 8 May his cognitive disability issue was put on the record,\u201d Bretado said. \u201cHe has now been returned to Mexico twice. He\u2019s got the brain capacity of a four-year-old.\u201d Before this the court had watched as the interpreter spoke to Jos\u00e9 on behalf of the judge, Nathan Herbert. \u201cCan you hear and understand the interpreter?\u201d Herbert asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Jos\u00e9 said softly. The hearing continued, with Jos\u00e9 a silent passenger, as the attorney for the Department of Homeland Security, Sarah Calvillo, fought against the test being admitted as evidence. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the doctor\u201d who performed the test, Calvillo said, pushing back aggressively against Bretado\u2019s presentation to the judge. Calvillo also questioned the veracity of how it was conducted. Herbert ordered that Jos\u00e9 undergo evaluation to determine if he should be removed from the Remain in Mexico program. It was an important step, but just one in an increasingly confusing system. After the hearing, Jos\u00e9 was taken into US custody so the examination could take place. He was held for three days, but then abruptly sent back to the Buen Pastor shelter. Jos\u00e9 later managed to tell his lawyer he had been teased by officials while in custody. They had told him he would be sent to a mental asylum, Jos\u00e9 said, away from his mother. When he got back to the shelter, he was upset and scared. Back in Virginia, Jos\u00e9\u2019s family knew none of this, because he hadn\u2019t been able to call them while in custody. The first update they, and Jos\u00e9\u2019s lawyer, had on his case after he went back to Mexico most recently, was when they got a call from Buen Pastor shelter. After all the hope that Jos\u00e9 would be reunited with his mother and family, he instead continues to wait there, hoping for an update to emerge from the Kafkaesque immigration court system. It remains unclear what will happen to Jos\u00e9. Under the ever-shifting immigration policies of the Trump administration, few can predict what will happen next. He might be ordered to remain in Mexico for an asylum hearing, months from now. He might be detained on the US side of the border. Jos\u00e9\u2019s family hope he will be allowed to enter the US to be with them while his case is processed, but there is no predicting when that might happen. \u201cIt would be a blessing. It\u2019s the thing we want the most,\u201d Maria, Jos\u00e9\u2019s sister, told the Guardian. For now, the family are forced to wait in limbo. They held a birthday party for Jos\u00e9 in June, and he has a space ready to sleep in Rosa\u2019s apartment. On Thursday, Tapia helped them Skype with Jos\u00e9 for the first time since he was stranded in Mexico. Everyone was in tears as they waved at each other down the phone, 3,000 miles apart. \u201cI have five children and four of them are here,\u201d Rosa said, after saying goodbye to her son. \u201cWe\u2019re all together now. He\u2019s the only one who is not here.\u201d",

After Labour\u2019s landslide victory in 1997, which ended 18 years of Tory rule, Tony Blair declared that there was no time for New Labour to waste as it set about rebuilding the country, and modernising its cash-deprived public services. \u201cToday, enough of talking.

Instead, in only his second sentence uttered as prime minister, he divided the country \u2013 and the world \u2013 into two halves between the \u201cpessimists at home and abroad\u201d who might dare to doubt the wisdom of Brexit, and those who believe the sheer \u201cpluck\u201d and \u201cnerve\u201d of the British people would ensure leaving the EU delivers ever greater freedom and prosperity. \u201cThe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters \u2013 they are going to get it wrong again.\u201d </p> <p>At times he sounded almost menacing. \u201cThe people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts, because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31st, no ifs or buts.\u201d If the dozens of Foreign Office members of staff who had crammed against the railings that give their courtyard a view of No 10, and the Cabinet Office employees who leaned out of windows to get a glimpse of the new prime minister, had expected a tone of conciliation, what they heard instead sounded more like the first shots in a general election campaign \u2013 one to be fought between those who truly believed in Brexit and those who opposed leaving the EU on 31 October, come what may, deal or no deal.</p> <p>Johnson gazed repeatedly up at the Whitehall buildings around him, telling those in government and outside it that things were about to change. His recognition of May\u2019s contribution to the government of the country was brief, almost cursory. \u201cI pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service,\u201d he said at the opening his speech. His real verdict on her time in office, as he drew to a close, was, however, scathing. \u201cAfter three years of unfounded self-doubt, it is time to change the record. To recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3f0bf7f39e63cbc9add7efc86be40246d66a4a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3f0bf7f39e63cbc9add7efc86be40246d66a4a3/0_87_2615_1569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson, centre left, holds his first cabinet meeting on Thursday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson, centre left, holds his first cabinet meeting on Thursday.

Soon after parading through its corridors to the applause of staff, he went straight to his office in the House of Commons to conduct the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\" title=\"\">savage purge of cabinet ministers</a> in modern political history. Some had seen the way the wind was blowing and concluded their best interests would be served by quitting before Johnson had the chance to sack them.</p> <p>Greg Clark, the business secretary who opposes a no-deal Brexit and believes it would be disastrous for the economy, had held an impromptu departure party on the Commons terrace on Tuesday evening, buying trays of drinks for friends and staff. The chancellor Philip Hammond had announced he was going too, and David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy, followed.

      "bodyText": "New prime ministers are often remembered for their grand, unifying pronouncements in the minutes before they enter No 10 Downing Street, when the world\u2019s gaze is upon them. Just over 40 years ago Margaret Thatcher, before a throng of reporters and with husband Denis looking on from the doorstep, quoted the words of St Francis of Assisi as she promised to bring the country together (\u201cwhere there is discord, may we bring harmony \u2026\u201d) On taking over from Thatcher in 1990, following years marred by social discord, including the miners\u2019 strike and the poll-tax riots, John Major spoke of creating \u201ca nation at ease with itself\u201d. After Labour\u2019s landslide victory in 1997, which ended 18 years of Tory rule, Tony Blair declared that there was no time for New Labour to waste as it set about rebuilding the country, and modernising its cash-deprived public services. \u201cToday, enough of talking. It is time, now, to do,\u201d he said. And just three years ago, Theresa May promised to fight the \u201cburning injustices\u201d that divided people from one another across Britain\u2019s unequal society, and to create \u201da country that works for everyone\u201d. By contrast, Boris Johnson, in his address to the nation last Wednesday afternoon, shunned the lofty, healing themes and soundbites of his predecessors. Instead, in only his second sentence uttered as prime minister, he divided the country \u2013 and the world \u2013 into two halves between the \u201cpessimists at home and abroad\u201d who might dare to doubt the wisdom of Brexit, and those who believe the sheer \u201cpluck\u201d and \u201cnerve\u201d of the British people would ensure leaving the EU delivers ever greater freedom and prosperity. \u201cThe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters \u2013 they are going to get it wrong again.\u201d At times he sounded almost menacing. \u201cThe people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts, because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31st, no ifs or buts.\u201d If the dozens of Foreign Office members of staff who had crammed against the railings that give their courtyard a view of No 10, and the Cabinet Office employees who leaned out of windows to get a glimpse of the new prime minister, had expected a tone of conciliation, what they heard instead sounded more like the first shots in a general election campaign \u2013 one to be fought between those who truly believed in Brexit and those who opposed leaving the EU on 31 October, come what may, deal or no deal. Johnson gazed repeatedly up at the Whitehall buildings around him, telling those in government and outside it that things were about to change. His recognition of May\u2019s contribution to the government of the country was brief, almost cursory. \u201cI pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service,\u201d he said at the opening his speech. His real verdict on her time in office, as he drew to a close, was, however, scathing. \u201cAfter three years of unfounded self-doubt, it is time to change the record. To recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged in the world.\u201d Johnson waved briefly on the No 10 doorstep, then disappeared inside for the first time as prime minister. Soon after parading through its corridors to the applause of staff, he went straight to his office in the House of Commons to conduct the most savage purge of cabinet ministers in modern political history. Some had seen the way the wind was blowing and concluded their best interests would be served by quitting before Johnson had the chance to sack them. Greg Clark, the business secretary who opposes a no-deal Brexit and believes it would be disastrous for the economy, had held an impromptu departure party on the Commons terrace on Tuesday evening, buying trays of drinks for friends and staff. The chancellor Philip Hammond had announced he was going too, and David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy, followed. But no one had expected the ruthless purge Johnson then ordered. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, his rival for the leadership in the last round of the contest, refused to be demoted to the defence brief and was fired. So, too, was Liam Fox, the pro-Brexit international trade secretary who had clashed with Johnson over how to deliver Brexit. Hunt supporters, even those who were pro-Brexit, including defence secretary Penny Mordaunt, were ousted, as were some of Johnson\u2019s cheerleaders, such as housing minister James Brokenshire. In all, 11 cabinet ministers lost their jobs in what the Tory MP Nigel Evans described as a \u201cmidsummer massacre\u201d.

Barnett asked how he was feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s rather a strange feeling,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cI always thought I was going to be prime minister myself\u2026 but there you are.\u201d</p> <p>Never mind, Stan. And he didn\u2019t, for he announced he\u2019d be having a word in his son\u2019s shell-like about issues. \u201cBrexit! Well Brexit\u2019s gonna be fixed, but don\u2019t forget about the rainforest!\u201d trumpeted Stanley. Stanley thought his son would be fine at being PM, because he\u2019s \u201cbeen through a tough English education\u201d. Eton and Oxford? wondered Barnett. \u201cCome on!\u201d said Stanley, before continuing to promote his son\u2019s prime ministerial qualifications. \u201cBut you know, OK, OK, don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s not doable. I know people who\u2019ve done it very competently and you might say, \u2018Well, were they really desperately qualified for it?\u2019 The answer is,\u201d said Stanley firmly, \u201cyou rise to the occasion.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, come on, dude! In my head, I could hear Shouty Man again. In real life, I think he was shouting \u201cStop Brexit\u201d.

You can hear the punch lines lumbering around the corner before they arrive. \u201cDUDE!\u201d bellowed Johnson, though we\u2019d all worked out that joke minutes before. \u201cDude\u201d. Yuk. Dude is the preferred endearment of the boho wealthy when they talk to their toddlers. \u201cAw, come on dude, it\u2019s not nice to be so rough with the kitty.\u201d Switching back to Barnett, her producers had Johnson Sr, Stanley, on the phone, to comment on his son\u2019s success. Barnett asked how he was feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s rather a strange feeling,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cI always thought I was going to be prime minister myself\u2026 but there you are.\u201d Never mind, Stan. And he didn\u2019t, for he announced he\u2019d be having a word in his son\u2019s shell-like about issues. \u201cBrexit! Well Brexit\u2019s gonna be fixed, but don\u2019t forget about the rainforest!\u201d trumpeted Stanley. Stanley thought his son would be fine at being PM, because he\u2019s \u201cbeen through a tough English education\u201d. Eton and Oxford? wondered Barnett. \u201cCome on!\u201d said Stanley, before continuing to promote his son\u2019s prime ministerial qualifications. \u201cBut you know, OK, OK, don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s not doable. I know people who\u2019ve done it very competently and you might say, \u2018Well, were they really desperately qualified for it?\u2019 The answer is,\u201d said Stanley firmly, \u201cyou rise to the occasion.\u201d Yes, come on, dude! In my head, I could hear Shouty Man again. In real life, I think he was shouting \u201cStop Brexit\u201d. But in my mind, it sounded like: \u201cWe\u2019re doomed.\u201d Three podcasts presented by real-life couples Feast of Fun One of the most successful and longest-lasting podcasts, Feast of Fun has been going since 2005 and has won the Best LGBT podcast award five times. It\u2019s essentially a talk show hosted by couple Fausto Fern\u00f3s and Marc Felion. They showcase all sorts of gay and gay-friendly people, some famous \u2013 George Takei, Margaret Cho, John Waters \u2013 but others not. Based in Chicago, Feast of Fun offers a weekly free episode, plus daily subscription-only shows. It might occasionally need an edit button, but it\u2019s funny and honest and a genuine pioneer of queer podcasting. Sh**ged Married Annoyed Standup Chris Ramsey based so much of his comedy around his relationship with his actor/singer wife, Rosie, and their young son, Robin, that earlier this year he and Rosie realised they should make a podcast about it. Both Chris and Rosie are from and live in South Shields, and their warmth and wit makes this immensely popular podcast a regular in the iTunes top 10. Listeners send in questions, as do celebrities, but the delight of this show is the hosts\u2019 silliness and fun. They\u2019re having a proper laugh together, and so do you. Maybe Baby This podcast is so new that the first episode only went out today. Virgin Radio presenter Kate Lawler and her fiance, Boj, are wondering whether or not they should have a child. He\u2019s for, she\u2019s agin. But might she change her mind? The couple talk to various celebrities (Spencer Matthews, Vogue Williams and Russell Kane are on the preview) about what being a parent is actually like. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought that having kids is like Fight Club, in that no one tells the truth until you\u2019ve joined, but this sounds like a fun show.",

      "bodyText": "\u2018We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves,\u201d announced Boris Johnson in Downing Street. His would be a government of \u201cpluck and nerve\u201d. An authentically Conservative government whose \u201cpowers of organisation and determination\u201d no one should underestimate. His government certainly should not be underestimated, but not for reasons Johnson can ever admit. It has no pluck, but what a nerve. It is Nigel Farage\u2019s government in spirit. His florid face and restless malice haunt its every meeting. Brexit party propagandists know its ministers are Farage\u2019s proteges. They urged them on as the temperature rose with cries of: \u201cBoris is making mincemeat out of the opposition. We\u2019ve got Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Raab in key government positions. And to top it all off, on the hottest day of the year, the Remoaner snowflakes are in total meltdown.\u201d It will be Farage\u2019s government in fact one day. Either Johnson will succeed in crashing Britain out of the EU, in which case there will be no reason not to merge the Conservative and Brexit parties. Or he will fail, in which case Farage will announce that Brexit has been betrayed and the Brexit party will replace the Conservative party. Either way, Farage is waiting for the call. \u201cWe need a political revolution in this country,\u201d he told a remarkably sycophantic interviewer. To deliver it to a grateful nation, he wouldn\u2019t rule out being prime minister himself. It is a helping-police-with-their-inquiries government, whose small army of politicians and advisers from the Vote Leave campaign may include among their number persons of interest to a criminal investigation by the Met into alleged breaches of electoral law in the 2016 referendum. With appropriate symmetry, the Met is also investigating Farage\u2019s outfit, Leave.EU. The chief commissioner says decisions on whether to prosecute none, either or both are due \u201cwithin weeks\u201d. It is a nepotism government. It so treats the affairs of state as a family affair that Johnson can make his brother Jo business minister, with no one in our decaying democracy finding the strength in their facial muscles to raise a quizzical eyebrow; where Stanley Johnson can appear on the propaganda channel of the Islamic Republic of Iran to announce that he looked forward to his son \u201cbuilding bridges with Iran\u201d \u2013 the poor man did not know that building bridges was not his sprog\u2019s forte \u2013 and say it on the very day his son was denouncing Jeremy Corbyn for taking money from the propaganda channel of the Islamic Republic of Iran. \u201cHow incredible that we should even think of entrusting that gentleman with the stewardship of this country\u2019s security,\u201d Johnson (Boris) declared. In truth, it is incredible that we consider entrusting this country\u2019s security to either, the more so because Johnson\u2019s supposedly patriotic government is also a clear-and-present-danger-to-the-nation government, a Make-Britain-Poor-Again government, which would hit the poorest people and regions just by leaving the single market. The supposed party of economic competence is going far further and envisaging an option that could break Britain by playing with a crash-out. The supposed party of national security would hammer defence industries with a no-deal Brexit. The supposed party of law and order has produced a government for organised crime by pulling Britain out of EU efforts to control international gangs through border, policing and criminal justice co-operation. The phoniness of this government\u2019s patriotism is revealed in its decision to trust Gavin Williamson, despite Theresa May firing him because there was \u201ccompelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorised disclosure\u201d from the National Security Council. How fitting that the phoney should be back at the cabinet table, for this, to add to the charge sheet, is a phoney government, which pretends its priority is advancing Brexit when its first duty is protecting Johnson\u2019s damaged ego. Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, was all for Brexit. She did not commit to Johnson, like a gangster committing to a crime boss, so he fired her. Liam Fox was one of the intellectual authors of Brexit \u2013 if that is not an abuse of the word. But he backed Hunt rather than Johnson, so he had to go too. As with Johnson, so with Farage. First in Ukip and now in the Brexit party, he has always loathed dissent, so much so that his Brexit party isn\u2019t even a party but a limited company owned by Farage and his cronies. The result is a yes-man government: a team of sycophants rather than of rivals. Nicky Morgan said in 2018 she would refuse to serve in an administration led by Boris Johnson after he accused Theresa May of strapping the UK to a \u201csuicide vest\u201d. That same year, Jo Johnson said a no-deal Brexit would \u201cinflict untold damage on our nation\u201d. In March 2019, Amber Rudd forced Theresa May to disavow a no-deal Brexit. Only a few weeks ago, Matt Hancock was showing the level of his oratory when he replied to (Boris) Johnson\u2019s \u201cfuck business\u201d dismissal of industry\u2019s fears about Brexit with \u201cI say fuck \u2018fuck business\u2019\u201d. It\u2019s not merely that Morgan, (Jo) Johnson, Rudd and Hancock have taken jobs in (Boris) Johnson\u2019s government \u2013 they sold out their country when they sold their souls by agreeing to make the Faragist pledge to support Britain leaving without a deal if that was what their master demanded.

If you prefer more wild herbiness (but still with that NZ clear-sky freshness) then Central Otago is the place to go.

There are deeper causes: the influence of academic theories like intersectionality and critical theory; changing parenting attitudes; the Great Recession; the growth of a <a href=\"https://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/84-million-per-year-for-u-m-diversity-employees\">massive</a> industry of HR officers and diversity tsars; frustration with the centrist tack of the Democratic party.</p> <p>Panic Attack is a methodical, earnest and often insightful work of reporting and analysis, not a fiery polemic. Investigating the limits and self-defeating tendencies of the social-justice left, Soave believes \u201cintersectionality\u201d has become a snake eating its own tail. To him, it is a discourse that claims to embrace the complexity of the human experience yet more often reduces human beings to categories; a <a href=\"https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/24/atonement-as-activism/\">crusade against privilege</a> often led by well-heeled students at outrageously expensive universities; a movement for inclusivity that is frequently exclusive, polarizing and toxic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Soave sees leftwing outrage culture and rightwing trolling culture as symbiotic and self-perpetuating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201c[F]raming a specific issue in identitarian terms makes it less appealing to people who do not identify with the category of marginalization in question,\u201d Soave argues. This, he says, makes issue coalitions \u201cless diverse\u201d and \u201cprone to tactical errors, such as engaging in performative acts that confirm the wokeness of the in-group but scare off\u201d prospective allies.</p> <p>Though most of the book is about the digital-age left, Soave also looks at the right. Like Angela Nagle and <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/safety-pin-box-richard-spencer-neo-nazis-alt-right-identity-politics/\">Shuja Haider</a>, he sees leftwing outrage culture and rightwing trolling culture as symbiotic and self-perpetuating, though he takes pains to avoid a false moral equivalence between the social-justice left and the racist alt-right.</p> <p>It is \u201cwrong to blame the left for the alt-right\u2019s bad behavior and odious beliefs\u201d, he writes. \u201cThe alt-right is a white nationalist movement, wholly undeserving of public sympathy\u201d and \u201ca testament to the enduring power of racism\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/11/reason-is-non-negotioable-steven-pinker-enlightenment-now-extract\">\u2018Reason is non-negotiable\u2019: Steven Pinker on the Enlightenment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The left\u2019s infatuation with <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/2017/aug/20/once-and-future-liberal-reviews-identity-politics-mark-lilla\">identity politics</a> and outrage culture is a fatal mistake, Soave argues, in part because it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/ta-nehisi-coates-whiteness-power.html\">plays directly into the hands</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/250053/is-it-ok-to-be-white\">alt-right</a>. By \u201cturning away from bedrock principles of liberalism, free speech and inclusion, the left has made it easier for people <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/technology/2016/apr/14/the-red-pill-reddit-modern-misogyny-manosphere-men\">to swallow the red pill</a>. Shutting down abhorrent far-right speakers backfires in that it distracts from the speakers\u2019 messages, casting them as martyrs and making their critics on the left seem like the intolerant ones.\u201d</p> <p>Reflexive accusations of racism and sexism have created a cry wolf problem \u2013 and efforts by left-leaning institutions and platforms to narrow the window of acceptable discourse have had the opposite effect. Soave quotes the psychologist <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/books/2018/feb/14/enlightenment-now-steven-pinker-review\">Steven Pinker</a>: limiting people\u2019s exposure to controversial ideas means that when they are exposed for the first time, those ideas are like a \u201cbacillus to which they have no immunity\u201d.</p> <p>We are faced with not only viruses of intolerance but superbugs, and they grow stronger every day.</p>",

Panic Attack is a methodical, earnest and often insightful work of reporting and analysis, not a fiery polemic. Investigating the limits and self-defeating tendencies of the social-justice left, Soave believes \u201cintersectionality\u201d has become a snake eating its own tail. To him, it is a discourse that claims to embrace the complexity of the human experience yet more often reduces human beings to categories; a crusade against privilege often led by well-heeled students at outrageously expensive universities; a movement for inclusivity that is frequently exclusive, polarizing and toxic. \u201c[F]raming a specific issue in identitarian terms makes it less appealing to people who do not identify with the category of marginalization in question,\u201d Soave argues. This, he says, makes issue coalitions \u201cless diverse\u201d and \u201cprone to tactical errors, such as engaging in performative acts that confirm the wokeness of the in-group but scare off\u201d prospective allies. Though most of the book is about the digital-age left, Soave also looks at the right. Like Angela Nagle and Shuja Haider, he sees leftwing outrage culture and rightwing trolling culture as symbiotic and self-perpetuating, though he takes pains to avoid a false moral equivalence between the social-justice left and the racist alt-right. It is \u201cwrong to blame the left for the alt-right\u2019s bad behavior and odious beliefs\u201d, he writes. \u201cThe alt-right is a white nationalist movement, wholly undeserving of public sympathy\u201d and \u201ca testament to the enduring power of racism\u201d. The left\u2019s infatuation with identity politics and outrage culture is a fatal mistake, Soave argues, in part because it plays directly into the hands of the alt-right. By \u201cturning away from bedrock principles of liberalism, free speech and inclusion, the left has made it easier for people to swallow the red pill. Shutting down abhorrent far-right speakers backfires in that it distracts from the speakers\u2019 messages, casting them as martyrs and making their critics on the left seem like the intolerant ones.\u201d Reflexive accusations of racism and sexism have created a cry wolf problem \u2013 and efforts by left-leaning institutions and platforms to narrow the window of acceptable discourse have had the opposite effect. Soave quotes the psychologist Steven Pinker: limiting people\u2019s exposure to controversial ideas means that when they are exposed for the first time, those ideas are like a \u201cbacillus to which they have no immunity\u201d. We are faced with not only viruses of intolerance but superbugs, and they grow stronger every day.",

I had long been a fan of the Body Shop\u2019s Body Butters and never saw the need to try the body yogurts \u2013 a lightweight gel texture \u2013 assuming they wouldn\u2019t impart any shine or hydration. Boy was I wrong. They tick all my boxes. Intensely moisturising, brilliantly cooling \u2013 perfect for the hot weather (it really should come in travel-sized tubes) and leaves the skin with a no-grease sheen that lasts all day. They come in many scents \u2013 my fave is pink grapefruit \u2013 so you\u2019re bound to find one you love. On my radar: three ways to smoother feet Save this file For a quick, safe and effective way to remove layers of hard skin, you need this brilliant steel foot file (with compressed crystal technology pads). It is literally everything. Margaret Dabbs London Foot File, \u00a324, margaretdabbs.co.uk Socks appeal This innovative sock \u2013 essentially a foot mask \u2013 has infused a cacophony of dead skin-nibbling acids to leave you with brighter, smoother feet. Patchology Poshpeel Pedi Cure, \u00a318, spacenk.com Smooth operator Cracked skin begone. There is a reason why this concentrated, non-greasy foot cream has developed a cult following.

Introduced in 2009, retweeting transformed the social media landscape, he suggests, by allowing people to pass on information without having bothered to digest it. The result has been \u201cthe incentivising of extreme, polarising and outrage-inducing content\u201d. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s CEO, is considering adopting \u201cincentives\u201d to \u201cencourage more consideration before spread\u201d.</p> <p>The debate over the retweet button may seem arcane and geeky.

      "bodyText": "Has the retweet ruined the world? Chris Wetherell, the software developer who built Twitter\u2019s retweet button, thinks so. Introduced in 2009, retweeting transformed the social media landscape, he suggests, by allowing people to pass on information without having bothered to digest it. The result has been \u201cthe incentivising of extreme, polarising and outrage-inducing content\u201d. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s CEO, is considering adopting \u201cincentives\u201d to \u201cencourage more consideration before spread\u201d. The debate over the retweet button may seem arcane and geeky. It is, though, a fascinating lens through which to understand many contemporary social issues. It reveals how social anxieties are often played out in debates about technology and how such debates reflect, and exacerbate, broader social prejudices. The problem of the retweet is not really a retweet problem. We can understand it only in the context of broader trends, in particular, our changing relationship to news and information and the growth of a more polarised society. Last week, the media regulator Ofcom published its 2019 report on news consumption in Britain. It showed the continuing trend of young people abandoning TV news as a source of information.

They only have limited knowledge and you can\u2019t correct it.\u201d Such critics point to the willingness of the electorate to believe Donald Trump\u2019s constant untruths, the Leave campaign\u2019s infamous bus slogan and the odious conspiracy theories to which many cling as evidence of what happens in a more fragmented information landscape. It\u2019s true that those who voted for Trump or for Brexit are likely to have been less educated than those who oppose the US president or support Remain. Yet the roots of ignorance and misinformation are complex. A recent study in the US asked Democrats and Republicans about what their opponents thought on a range of political issues, from tax to immigration.

While still experimental, this audio technology could benefit the hard of hearing (11 million people in the UK), commuters on trains or buses trying to watch television on their phones and, of course, people like myself who really need to know what people in swimwear half my age are bickering about on Love Island. Nobody claimed that it would sort out questionable viewing choices. It\u2019s hard to celebrate Dyson cleaning up in Singapore James Dyson seems to be settling in wonderfully in Singapore, first buying the region\u2019s most expensive apartment (\u00a343m), and now another gaff (a snip at \u00a326.5m) with its own waterfall. I don\u2019t know about you, but I feel as though I should be dashing over to Singapore with a basket of muffins as a housewarming gift for the inventor. Now that the dust has settled, is it time to suck it up, perchance with the bagless vacuum cleaner that made Dyson\u2019s name (other brands are available)? Does it matter that Dyson was a vocal cheerleader for Brexit, only to uproot his company HQ and relocate to Singapore in a move that looked suspiciously like an attempt to avoid damage caused by, well, Brexit? Dyson (still running research facilities in the UK) says that Brexit had nothing (nothing, he says!) to do with the move. Yet people are still griping as though he\u2019d irresponsibly scarpered. I\u2019m embarrassed for Britain \u2013 can\u2019t a bloke enjoy his private waterfall in a south-east Asian corporate tax haven in peace? We all need to get over it and wish Dyson well. In due course, perhaps we could all club together, using whatever becomes the new exciting post-Brexit currency (Groats? Bone-necklaces? Hunks of human hair?) to send our favourite billionaire that tasty basket of muffins. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s most prominent criminal lawyers has become the legal adviser for detectives investigating an army agent operating in the top ranks of the IRA, the Observer can reveal. The spy, known as \u201cStakeknife\u201d and once described as the \u201cjewel in the crown\u201d of British military intelligence, allegedly was implicated in acts of murder and torture while he ran the IRA\u2019s internal security squad during the Troubles. The appointment of Jonathan Laidlaw QC, who defended News International boss Rebekah Brooks and has prosecuted Al-Qaida bombers, is being seen by legal experts as a sign of \u201cserious intent\u201d to put the army\u2019s long-serving informer in the dock. Reports have widely named Freddie Scappaticci, 73, as Stakeknife, the man in charge of the IRA\u2019s spy-catching unit that interrogated and killed members of the Provisionals accused of being informers. Since 2003, Scappaticci has denied he was \u201cStakeknife\u201d. But it is alleged that, while the unit abducted, sometimes tortured and shot informers dead, Stakeknife was a double agent passing on high-grade information to his handlers in British military intelligence. The Observer has learnt that Operation Kenova, the multimillion pound inquiry into the activities of Stakeknife, recruited Laidlaw to help its detectives draw up the legal papers needed to bring any prosecution. Legal sources have told the Observer that Laidlaw\u2019s experience in preparing charges for long-running investigations and ensuring cases are brought to trial will be crucial to Operation Kenova bringing the alleged army agent to court back in Northern Ireland. They said that Operation Kenova needed someone of Laidlaw\u2019s calibre to \u201cenable them to battle against the resistance both the Ministry of Defence and MI5 will put up to stop Stakeknife appearing in court. It shows serious intent to do so.\u201d Both the security forces and the leadership of the republican movement may have concerns if Stakeknife is forced to give evidence about his alleged role as an agent inside the IRA\u2019s most secretive unit. There are concerns that testimony could reveal the identities of alleged handlers and any alleged willingness to \u201csacrifice\u201d low-level informers to protect their agent placed in the upper echelons of the IRA. Laidlaw is a Treasury Counsel, a government lawyer who has been employed to prosecute Britain\u2019s first war crimes case, act as prosecuting lawyer against Al-Qaida suspects, as well as the IRA bombers who targeted Canary Wharf in 1996. He has also acted as defence counsel for Brooks when she was acquitted of all charges in the phone-hacking trial. Operation Kenova is headed by the chief constable of Bedfordshire, Jon Boutcher. He has promised to complete his report by the end of this year and will then hand his files to the Public Prosecution Service for Belfast. Operation Kenova has now gathered more than 12,000 documents, recorded over 1,000 statements and conducted 129 with witnesses, some of whom alleged they were picked up, tortured, threatened and beaten by Stakeknife\u2019s IRA unit. As well as the agent himself, Operation Kenova is questioning members of the security forces over their role in running an agent they are accused of allowing to kill with impunity. A spokesman for Operation Kenova declined to make any comment about Laidlaw\u2019s appointment.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018No ifs or buts.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to voters in his first speech as prime minister was that he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, come what may. He has spent the early days of his premiership setting the country on a disastrous course towards a no-deal Brexit. What unfolds will shape Britain for at least a generation to come: the health of our economy, the gap between the haves and the have-nots; the integrity of the union; our relationship with our allies; the determination of our place in the world.</p> <p>Britain has never been more in need of a leader capable of healing a divided nation. Yet though Johnson has promised to be a prime minister for the whole of the United Kingdom, the angry protests that greeted him at Downing Street symbolise how contentious and divisive a figure he is. Though he lacks any mandate, beyond winning a contest decided by the unrepresentative sliver of the electorate that makes up the Tory party membership, he has made no conciliatory attempt to unify the country, no effort to interpret the referendum result in the context of the slim majority it produced for Leave. He has left no doubt that he will not be a prime minister for Scotland and Northern Ireland, for those who voted Remain, for the least affluent areas of the country that will be hardest hit if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. He will be a prime minister for the minority of voters who say they support a no-deal Brexit and the rest of us be damned.</p> <h2>A toxic prospectus for government<br></h2> <p>Johnson\u2019s opening performances as prime minister were not encouraging. Both his Downing Street speech and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2019/july/prime-minister-statement-on-priorities-for-government/\" title=\"\">his parliamentary statement</a> the next day lacked gravitas and were characterised by the rambling and blustering that have come to be Johnson trademarks.</p> <p>But to underestimate him would be a mistake. His actions since becoming prime minister leave little room for doubt that the \u201cdo or die\u201d approach to Brexit he set out during the leadership contest was not just a play to win the hearts of the Tory selectorate. It was a toxic prospectus for government and there is a dangerous strategy that sits behind it: to make demands of the EU he knows there is almost zero chance it can agree to, making a no-deal exit more likely. And to prepare for the parliamentary showdown that this will inevitably precipitate, by presenting himself as the prime minister standing up for the will of the people against an recalcitrant legislature.</p> <p>So there is every chance that Britain will face an election soon. That Johnson has put his new government on a general election footing is obvious, not just in the spending commitments designed to appeal to Tory marginal voters, but in his dramatic cull of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet. Out went the moderates who have been clear they cannot countenance a no-deal scenario. In came a sorry collection of incompetents, unreconstructed Thatcherites and anti-European ideologues.</p> <p>Priti Patel, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/08/priti-patel-forced-to-resign-over-unofficial-meetings-with-israelis\" title=\"\">sacked as international development strategy </a>in 2017 for carrying out unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers while on holiday, is home secretary. She has a dismal record on civil liberties, which includes making <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/priti-patel-death-penalty-ian-hislop-question-time-video-home-secretary-9020006\" title=\"\">an incoherent case for the death penalty</a> on the BBC as recently as 2011.

The new foreign secretary is Dominic Raab, whose vision for post-Brexit Britain is a race to the bottom on taxes and regulation. Gavin Williamson, sacked just weeks ago as defence secretary for leaking sensitive information, is back as education secretary. Johnson\u2019s cabinet shows he prizes loyalty over competence. It represents a collective lurch rightwards, the logical next chapter of a story that began with Cameron\u2019s capitulation to his party\u2019s Eurosceptics in holding a referendum and continued with the red lines Theresa May adopted to keep them happy.</p> <h2>No deal will hit the economy hard<br></h2> <p>Johnson has set Britain on a collision course with Europe in making scrapping the backstop a precondition for any further negotiations. The EU cannot remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement unless there is another Irish border solution in place. To do so risks forcing a choice between undermining the Good Friday agreement or unravelling the integrity of the single market. So it looks like Britain is heading for no deal, which every forecast predicts will hit the economy hard. The pain will be inflicted most sharply on the areas that have suffered most as a result of deindustrialisation and on the families who can least afford to bear a further economic shock after a decade of austerity.</p> <p>A no-deal Brexit also makes the breakup of the UK more likely. It would provide further <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/sir-john-curtice-brexit-deadlock-pushing-scottish-remain-voters-to-independence-1-4957405\" title=\"\">succour to the Scottish independence movement</a>. It could necessitate the reimposition of home rule in Northern Ireland, which \u2013 together with a border \u2013 might sufficiently shift public opinion to require a poll on Irish reunification.</p> <p>And in making Britain more reliant on the US for trade, no deal risks putting us at the whims of a volatile, self-avowedly America First president. Donald Trump may have been effusive about the prospect of a US-UK trade deal, but large disparities in economic clout put the UK in a relatively weak position. He will do Johnson no favours and the UK can expect the tearing down of health and environmental standards <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Summary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf]\" title=\"\">to be on the table</a> in any trade talks. The White House is also calculating that closer trade ties will increase its leverage over the UK, drawing us further into its geopolitical and foreign policy orbit, diminishing Britain\u2019s sovereign control over its affairs.</p> <h2>Pre-election bribes</h2> <p>Johnson knows what pain lies ahead, which is why he has made commitments on increased spending on the police, schools and hospitals and transport infrastructure. More money in these areas is to be welcomed, but this is a pre-election bribe for voters, rather than a strategy to rebuild a state brought low by 10 years of austerity.</p> <p>Services for the most vulnerable in society, such as the children\u2019s services that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/01/observer-view-uk-inadequate-childrens-services\" title=\"\">cut six times as fast </a>in the poorest areas of the country compared with the most affluent, will barely get a look in. Expensive tax cuts will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnsons-tax-cut-would-benefit-richest-10-most-say-experts\" title=\"\">predominantly benefit</a> the richest 10% of families, while there will be no relief for the low-income families with children who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/14/universal-credit-hardship-tories\" title=\"\">lost thousands of pounds a year </a>through cuts to their tax credits and benefits. And these giveaways will pale into insignificance when set against the long-term damage to the public finances that will be wreaked by a no-deal Brexit.</p> <h2>Labour must step up<br></h2> <p>Any hope of avoiding the calamity of a no-deal Brexit rests on the decisions of Conservative moderates and the Labour leadership. If Johnson chooses to face parliament down rather than call for a pre-emptive general election, the decision of those Tories who oppose no deal will become critical. It may well be that the only way of stopping no deal will be to pass a vote of no confidence in the government by mid-October, which would trigger a general election that could conceivably put Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. If it is the only way of avoiding no deal, they must do so or be complicit in what follows.</p> <p>Johnson will position the Tories as the no-deal party and treat any general election as a quasi-referendum. It\u2019s a high-risk strategy: he is gambling that any seats he loses to the Liberal Democrats \u2013 who have been admirably, and consistently, clear on the issue of Brexit \u2013 will be more than compensated for by attracting voters that might otherwise be tempted by the Brexit party. What will ensure his bet pays off is if Labour continues to equivocate. Just last week, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, <a href=\"backhttps://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/john-mcdonnell/news/105548/watch-john-mcdonnell-suggests\" title=\"\">appeared to backpedal</a> from Labour\u2019s current position by saying it would \u201clook at\u201d any deal Johnson brings back. This is entirely disingenuous in implying that there could be a Johnson deal that Labour could support.</p> <p>Labour cannot win a general election by trying to please everyone on the biggest question Britain has faced in decades and winding up pleasing no one. It cannot wish Brexit away as an issue: it must commit to being a referendum-and-Remain party. It must focus its attacks on a Johnson no deal rather than fruitlessly aiming at easy targets among the Liberal Democrats .</p> <p>Our future prosperity is now at the whim of a group of ideologues who don\u2019t represent Britain but are nevertheless running the country. Johnson\u2019s strategy is clearly to lead Britain into a catastrophic Brexit if that\u2019s what it takes to bolster his premiership and his party against the Farage threat. There are those who still have the power to stop him. The question is, will they step up?</p>",

Labour must step up Any hope of avoiding the calamity of a no-deal Brexit rests on the decisions of Conservative moderates and the Labour leadership. If Johnson chooses to face parliament down rather than call for a pre-emptive general election, the decision of those Tories who oppose no deal will become critical. It may well be that the only way of stopping no deal will be to pass a vote of no confidence in the government by mid-October, which would trigger a general election that could conceivably put Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. If it is the only way of avoiding no deal, they must do so or be complicit in what follows. Johnson will position the Tories as the no-deal party and treat any general election as a quasi-referendum. It\u2019s a high-risk strategy: he is gambling that any seats he loses to the Liberal Democrats \u2013 who have been admirably, and consistently, clear on the issue of Brexit \u2013 will be more than compensated for by attracting voters that might otherwise be tempted by the Brexit party. What will ensure his bet pays off is if Labour continues to equivocate. Just last week, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appeared to backpedal from Labour\u2019s current position by saying it would \u201clook at\u201d any deal Johnson brings back. This is entirely disingenuous in implying that there could be a Johnson deal that Labour could support. Labour cannot win a general election by trying to please everyone on the biggest question Britain has faced in decades and winding up pleasing no one. It cannot wish Brexit away as an issue: it must commit to being a referendum-and-Remain party. It must focus its attacks on a Johnson no deal rather than fruitlessly aiming at easy targets among the Liberal Democrats . Our future prosperity is now at the whim of a group of ideologues who don\u2019t represent Britain but are nevertheless running the country. Johnson\u2019s strategy is clearly to lead Britain into a catastrophic Brexit if that\u2019s what it takes to bolster his premiership and his party against the Farage threat. There are those who still have the power to stop him. The question is, will they step up?",

      "bodyText": "A severely epileptic five-year-old girl risks an \u201cunnecessary death\u201d according to her mother after border guards seized her consignment of medical cannabis oils at Stansted airport. Indie-Rose Clarry, who has Dravet syndrome, a form of epilepsy, suffered severe seizures and panic attacks before using the medication over the past 14 months, said her mother, Tannine Montgomery. However, Montgomery was stopped by Border Force officers on Friday after returning from the Netherlands, even though she had a private prescription for the medicine written by her UK doctor. \u201cSeizing this medicine is condemning my lovely daughter to becoming comatose, racked by seizures and to be at high risk of an unnecessary death,\u201d said Montgomery. \u201cFor the love of God, this medicine is legal in the UK and I have a full lawful UK prescription for it.\u201d Parliament\u2019s health select committee told the Home Office this month to stop confiscating cannabis from the parents of sick children. Despite the government announcing last year that doctors can prescribe medical cannabis, which contains the psychoactive ingredient THC, campaigners said just two NHS prescriptions have so far been granted. Montgomery, from Suffolk, said that although she had a private UK prescription it was far cheaper to travel to the Netherlands to stock up on the oils. She yesterday urged health secretary Matt Hancock to \u201csort this crisis out\u201d. Although it is illegal to import such medicines without a licence, Mongtomery, 30, said UK Border Force officials have previously allowed her into the country with the drug. \u201cTo obtain a special import licence would cost us \u00a34,500 per month as opposed to the \u00a31,500 we pay for the drug at the moment,\u201d she said. Montgomery added that Hancock needed to intervene to halt the suffering of families. \u201cEvery day he doesn\u2019t act on it is a day of interminable suffering for mothers like me. \u201cFor families like us it\u2019s too much to bear the frustration of knowing that there\u2019s something that can transform the lives of our children but we are blocked from getting it,\u201d she said. Former home secretary Sajid Javid announced in 2018 that doctors would be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis products, including for severe epilepsy. However, parents have found they cannot easily access the medicines without paying thousands of pounds for an import licence. In addition, many doctors will not prescribe them, citing a lack of official guidance on the issue. Peter Carroll, from the campaign group End Our Pain, added: \u201cThis is truly shocking. The law was changed last November so that patients who could benefit from medical cannabis could be prescribed it here.",

The revelations expose a fresh dimension of the UK\u2019s hostile environment, showing that the strategy also persecutes passport-holding British citizens of colour.

      "bodyText": "The social justice and moral revival campaigner Rev William Barber has called on 2020 presidential candidates to visit Reserve, Louisiana, the town with America\u2019s highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins. Barber took part in a two-day tour of toxic pollution sites in southern Louisiana as part of his national Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Last month he drew several prominent Democratic 2020 candidates, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, to an event in Washington. \u201cIf you cannot come here to Reserve, then you don\u2019t have any business being president,\u201d Barber said on Saturday. \u201cIf you can\u2019t come here to Cancer Alley, you don\u2019t need to be at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d Barber, who is also president of Repairers of the Breach, was speaking at the entrance to the Pontchartrain Works facility, a chemicals plant in Reserve that is the primary cause of a cancer risk 50 times the national average. Flanked by members of the Concerned Citizens of Saint John the Baptist, a parish advocacy group fighting air pollution, Barber added: \u201cThese folks are not anti-job or anti-industry. They\u2019re anti-death. They\u2019re anti-being-killed when it doesn\u2019t have to happen. \u201cYou can have both. You can have the jobs and you can have regulation on not poisoning the water, poisoning the air and destroying people\u2019s lives.\u201d Reserve is the centre of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, exploring air pollution in St John the Baptist parish and other communities between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, a stretch of land known as cancer alley. \u201cIt made us feel like we aren\u2019t in this fight alone,\u201d said the Concerned Citizens president, Mary Hampton. The Pontchartrain Works facility is the only place in the US that produces the synthetic rubber Neoprene, which contains the primary constituent chloroprene, listed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a likely carcinogen. The plant is owned by the Japanese chemicals firm Denka, which purchased it from the US chemical giant DuPont in 2015. DuPont had run Neoprene production at the site since 1964. Barber visited another plant in neighbouring St James parish, the Uncle Sam plant operated by the fertilizer company Mosaic. The facility is home to a 200ft reservoir of acidic wastewater encased in walls of trace-radioactive gypsum. \u201cThat monstrosity is one of the greatest threats we face in southern Louisiana,\u201d said Robert Taylor, director of the Concerned Citizens of Saint John the Baptist, gesturing at the imposing walls. Barber and assembled residents also discussed the history of the land along the Mississippi where chemical plants now sit. Nearly all of it was once given over to sugar and rice plantations. \u201cSo they went from plantations to plants, killing people with contamination,\u201d Barber said. The tour came the morning after a town hall in New Orleans, co-hosted by the Poor People\u2019s Campaign and the Guardian, to discuss the impact of pollution in the region. In a panel session attended by community members, local politicians and environmental scientists, Barber pledged to make pollution issues in Reserve a central part of his campaign. \u201cWe have to drive this into the public narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to drive this into the public consciousness, and that part of the reason why the Poor People\u2019s Campaign is here.\u201d On Thursday, a study published by the University Network for Human Rights found that residents in Reserve have been diagnosed with cancer at \u201chighly unusual\u201d rates. The report was dismissed by Denka, which had not been shown its findings. \u201cFrom what we have learned, the study appears to be based on individual interviews rather than scientific analysis of actual cancer incidences,\u201d a Denka spokesman, Jim Harris, said. The company has long disputed the dangers presented by chloroprene and is currently lobbying the federal government to change its \u201clikely carcinogen\u201d status.",

In 2017, a record 41% of Americans said racial discrimination was the main reason black people could not get ahead. Among Democrats the figure was 64%, more than double what it was in 2010.

But race and racism remain hot issues and the NAACP presidential forum provided a preview of battles to come in the second Democratic debate, which will take place in Detroit next week. Biden said he was \u201cnot going to be as polite this time\u201d.

This has been fuelled in part by an eccentric process that has handed power over the destiny of the UK to a small and entirely unrepresentative Tory membership (just over one-tenth of one per cent of the British population) who then, in predictable fashion, duly agreed to support the unthinkable as party leader and prime minister. Another factor should not, however, be underestimated \u2013 the list of right-wing ideologues who will sit around the cabinet table in Downing Street. Most of the names represent a metaphor for the chasm that now exists between Scottish political values and the political culture that flourishes today in many parts of England.</p> <p>Most Scots since the 1970s have favoured social democratic policies with a leftish flavour. A clear majority also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">voted to remain in the EU</a> in 2016. Now this electorate is presented by an array of hard-right Brexiter zealots holding key positions in the British government. It would be difficult to think of a bunch more likely to increase Scottish disenchantment with \u201cour precious union\u201d (\u00a9 T May).</p> <p>The second reaction has come from the SNP and those who espouse the cause of Scottish independence. Of course, their deeply hostile public responses to the Johnson coronation were entirely predictable. In private, however, the independence camp must be in celebratory mood. For them, Christmas has come early. The UK is now led by the best recruiting sergeant for the cause of Scottish independence since the days of Margaret Thatcher, she who was dubbed by the late Donald Dewar as the \u201cmother of the Scottish Parliament\u201d established on the back of reaction to her deeply unpopular policies.</p> <p>Johnson is the very incarnation of everything Scottish nationalists loathe in English right-wing Tories: foppish, rich, privileged, incompetent, xenophobic. They will have enormous fun at his expense in the coming months as they milk the opportunity afforded by his election to try to batter the Union to death both within and outside Westminster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c4787a1adf39ad9f0bf9cad6707cd1d747b2de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c4787a1adf39ad9f0bf9cad6707cd1d747b2de8/0_0_4890_3261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson faces the prospect of seeing everything she has done to rejuvenate Conservatism in Scotland unravelling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Davidson faces the prospect of seeing everything she has done to rejuvenate Conservatism in Scotland unravelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Jack/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there are the Scottish Conservatives. Some did their best to avoid the horrendous outcome which has now been visited upon them through the aptly named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/oct/02/operation-arse-secret-tory-plot-keep-boris-johnson-out\" title=\"\">Operation Arse</a>. They failed. Johnson triumphed over them. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, now faces the prospect of the project designed to rejuvenate Conservatism in Scotland falling apart before her very eyes. This was not the doing of either the SNP or Labour, but of English Tories hell-bent on having Johnson as their champion, the only man who could save them from being overwhelmed by the Brexit party tsunami. It will be most interesting to see how Davidson\u2019s well-publicised talents cope with this thorny problem.</p> <p>In his first brief public confrontation with Johnson, the SNP Leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, described him as <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/ian-blackford-brands-boris-johnson-last-prime-minister-of-uk-in-fiery-commons-clash-1-4971129\" title=\"\">\u201cthe last prime minister of the United Kingdom\u201d</a>. It was a public admission of the sheer joy in SNP ranks at being presented with the political gift of Johnson\u2019s elevation. Blackford just stopped short of rubbing his hands in glee. But could the union between Scotland and England actually come to an end during Johnson\u2019s watch?</p> <p>There are omens. The most recent opinion polling suggests the gap between those for and against Scottish independence has narrowed to a close 49 per cent for \u201cyes\u201d and 51 per cent for \u201cno\u201d \u2013 and this before any Johnson effect is taken into account. Pollsters reckon that Johnson as PM could add a few more percentage points to the Yes vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/01/boris-johnson-scotland-tories-union\">How Boris Johnson\u2019s Scotland problem could keep the Tories out of power | Katy Balls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there is his vow to deliver Brexit by October, even at the cost of no deal, a scenario which would have potentially serious consequences for the Scottish economy. If no deal happened, the threshold of risk in people\u2019s eyes might therefore shift dramatically to independence as a better option, with the prospect of rejoining the EU afterwards.</p> <p>There are also longer term forces to be taken into account. English nationalism, red in tooth and claw, is now a political reality. Its message is England first, and with that scant regard for the needs or interests of the other three nations in May\u2019s \u201cprecious union\u201d. Apparently English nationalists are even prepared to see the end of the union if that is the cost of achieving Brexit. This writer has long felt that the English factor would eventually be more decisive in the collapse of the union than forces emanating from Scotland.</p> <p>However, it is likely that Johnson will be spared the humiliation of going down in history as the UK\u2019s last prime minister. Granting the authority to hold another referendum on Scottish independence is a power reserved for Westminster. A Johnson government will be resolutely opposed to ever agreeing to such a concession. Equally, the intrinsically canny and cautious Scottish government, loth to alienate moderate voters, is unlikely to contemplate employing \u201cother\u201d methods, at least in the short run.</p> <p>Johnson is more likely to be evicted from Downing Street by a vote of no confidence and defeat in a general election than by an existential crisis in the union. Nevertheless, future historians might well consider recent events as an important milestone on the road to eventual Scottish independence.</p> <p><em>Sir Tom Devine\u2019s books include The Scottish Nation: 1700-2007</em></p>",

Most Scots since the 1970s have favoured social democratic policies with a leftish flavour. A clear majority also voted to remain in the EU in 2016. Now this electorate is presented by an array of hard-right Brexiter zealots holding key positions in the British government. It would be difficult to think of a bunch more likely to increase Scottish disenchantment with \u201cour precious union\u201d (\u00a9 T May). The second reaction has come from the SNP and those who espouse the cause of Scottish independence. Of course, their deeply hostile public responses to the Johnson coronation were entirely predictable. In private, however, the independence camp must be in celebratory mood. For them, Christmas has come early. The UK is now led by the best recruiting sergeant for the cause of Scottish independence since the days of Margaret Thatcher, she who was dubbed by the late Donald Dewar as the \u201cmother of the Scottish Parliament\u201d established on the back of reaction to her deeply unpopular policies. Johnson is the very incarnation of everything Scottish nationalists loathe in English right-wing Tories: foppish, rich, privileged, incompetent, xenophobic. They will have enormous fun at his expense in the coming months as they milk the opportunity afforded by his election to try to batter the Union to death both within and outside Westminster. And then there are the Scottish Conservatives. Some did their best to avoid the horrendous outcome which has now been visited upon them through the aptly named Operation Arse. They failed. Johnson triumphed over them. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, now faces the prospect of the project designed to rejuvenate Conservatism in Scotland falling apart before her very eyes. This was not the doing of either the SNP or Labour, but of English Tories hell-bent on having Johnson as their champion, the only man who could save them from being overwhelmed by the Brexit party tsunami. It will be most interesting to see how Davidson\u2019s well-publicised talents cope with this thorny problem. In his first brief public confrontation with Johnson, the SNP Leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, described him as \u201cthe last prime minister of the United Kingdom\u201d. It was a public admission of the sheer joy in SNP ranks at being presented with the political gift of Johnson\u2019s elevation. Blackford just stopped short of rubbing his hands in glee. But could the union between Scotland and England actually come to an end during Johnson\u2019s watch? There are omens. The most recent opinion polling suggests the gap between those for and against Scottish independence has narrowed to a close 49 per cent for \u201cyes\u201d and 51 per cent for \u201cno\u201d \u2013 and this before any Johnson effect is taken into account. Pollsters reckon that Johnson as PM could add a few more percentage points to the Yes vote. Then there is his vow to deliver Brexit by October, even at the cost of no deal, a scenario which would have potentially serious consequences for the Scottish economy. If no deal happened, the threshold of risk in people\u2019s eyes might therefore shift dramatically to independence as a better option, with the prospect of rejoining the EU afterwards. There are also longer term forces to be taken into account. English nationalism, red in tooth and claw, is now a political reality. Its message is England first, and with that scant regard for the needs or interests of the other three nations in May\u2019s \u201cprecious union\u201d. Apparently English nationalists are even prepared to see the end of the union if that is the cost of achieving Brexit. This writer has long felt that the English factor would eventually be more decisive in the collapse of the union than forces emanating from Scotland. However, it is likely that Johnson will be spared the humiliation of going down in history as the UK\u2019s last prime minister. Granting the authority to hold another referendum on Scottish independence is a power reserved for Westminster. A Johnson government will be resolutely opposed to ever agreeing to such a concession. Equally, the intrinsically canny and cautious Scottish government, loth to alienate moderate voters, is unlikely to contemplate employing \u201cother\u201d methods, at least in the short run. Johnson is more likely to be evicted from Downing Street by a vote of no confidence and defeat in a general election than by an existential crisis in the union. Nevertheless, future historians might well consider recent events as an important milestone on the road to eventual Scottish independence.

Plan to turn plastic into fuel for homes</a>\u201d, News). The effort of collecting, transporting and cleaning them for possible recycling has largely failed, created much more pollution and contributed massively to climate change. The idea of burning plastics and using the energy to heat our homes was proposed by the plastics company Dow more than 30 years ago: it suggested treating all plastics as \u201cborrowed oil\u201d. At that time, ordinary domestic waste had a calorific value of low-grade coal, so the suggestion was that this waste should be burned in efficient plants with heat recovery and treatment of the gases produced, perhaps even trapping the carbon dioxide produced, rather than trying to recycle the complex (and dirty) mix of plastics.</p> <p>Today, with higher use of more complex plastics, this makes even more sense. Mixed plastics cannot really be recycled: they are long-chain molecules, like spaghetti, so if you reheat and reprocess them, you inevitably end up with something of lower performance; it\u2019s called down-cycling. Newsprint is what happens when you recycle paper: low strength is inevitable.

      "bodyText": "Senator Rex Patrick has announced Centre Alliance will support an inquiry into controversial meetings between Angus Taylor and the environment department over endangered grasslands. The reversal ups pressure on the energy minister after a week of Labor and the Greens targeting Taylor in parliament over whether he stood to personally benefit from lobbying to water down environmental protections for the grasslands. Taylor attempted to fend off the attacks by producing a letter from the NSW Farmers Association written nearly six months after the meetings were held, purporting to show the minister was acting in the interests of his constituents and not himself. On Thursday a Senate motion to establish a committee inquiry into Taylor\u2019s role was narrowly defeated 35 votes to 31, with Centre Alliance siding with the government in what Labor\u2019s Penny Wong described as a \u201cprotection racket\u201d for the minister. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But on Sunday Patrick said his party will now support the inquiry because freedom of information documents \u2013 revealed by a Guardian Australia investigation \u2013 show that Taylor was trying to meet with the department in relation to the classification of the grasslands and at that point there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of any constituent concern about the issue. Patrick said last week he was dissuaded from supporting an inquiry because \u201cwhilst [Taylor] was seeking a change, no change occurred\u201d and the letter \u2013 which he had not checked the date on \u2013 appeared to show a constituent had raised the issue. \u201cHowever, having now looked at the letter, it came six months after Angus [Taylor] sought a meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an area of concern in there for me.\u201d Despite Centre Alliance\u2019s change of heart, the government can continue to block an inquiry if Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation and former Liberal Cory Bernardi continue to vote with the Coalition in the Senate. Bernardi told Guardian Australia he has not had \u201cany representations to me suggesting why I should change my vote\u201d. He said he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d about nor had he seen the letter. In June a Guardian Australia investigation revealed Taylor met officials from then environment minister Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office and department to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of the critically endangered grasslands known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. The meetings occurred at the same time that New South Wales and federal investigations were under way into the poisoning of about 30 hectares that contained the grasses on a property in the state\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office canvassed whether protections for the grasslands could be watered down and if the change had to be published. Patrick said an inquiry would \u201callow for both sides of table to put facts on the table\u201d. \u201cThe focus is: was Angus Taylor seeking to influence a department on behalf of himself or related parties, or family members. That needs to be explored.\u201d In the Senate on Thursday Wong said that Taylor obtained the meetings \u201cbecause he was a cabinet minister\u201d, suggesting that in itself was \u201ccorrupt\u201d. Wong withdrew the word \u201ccorrupt\u201d but continued to argue that government members \u201cknow this is not kosher\u201d and that Taylor\u2019s conduct was a \u201cgross misuse of public office\u201d. \u201cThe point is that it is a misuse of public office as a cabinet minister to ask for treatment from a colleague in relation to a general policy proposition that is not available to everybody else,\u201d she said. Wong also accused Taylor of failing to declare his \u201cdirect interest\u201d in Jam Land. Taylor has declared his interest in Gufee Pty Ltd \u2013 which is a one-third owner of Jam Land \u2013 on the register of interests but there is no declaration of Jam Land.",

On Sunday Fletcher told ABC\u2019s Insiders that the final committee report recommending a review of unemployment benefits was signed off by its members, but did not deny that he caused a stronger call for an increase to be removed. It comes as the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, stares down a push within the Nationals to overturn government policy by commissioning modelling on the economic impact of lifting Newstart. The government is facing calls from within its own ranks \u2013 including from Liberals Dean Smith, Russell Broadbent and Andrew Wallace and Nationals Matt Canavan and Barnaby Joyce \u2013 to lift the rate of Newstart, a position that was also formally adopted by the Labor caucus this week. On Tuesday the Sydney Morning Herald revealed that in April a parliamentary committee chaired by Broadbent was set to recommend an increase before Fletcher intervened to warn the final report could not contain the specific Newstart recommendation. The other members of the committee were the Liberal MPs Kevin Andrews, Bert van Manen, Ben Morton and Rowan Ramsey, as well as the Labor MPs Ged Kearney and Sharon Bird. \u201cThe recommendations of that report were agreed by the members of the committee,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it always works with a parliamentary committee.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Insiders presenter Annabel Crabb asked at least five times if Fletcher intervened or contacted the committee members about the content of the report, but the minister continued to say only that committee members had signed off on the final report. \u201cLook, I speak to colleagues all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to go into the conversations that I have with colleagues.\u201d Crabb said it was \u201ctotally clear\u201d from his refusal to deny the report that it was correct he had personally intervened.

In a further sign of disquiet within the government about the issue, News Corp\u2019s Sunday papers reported that the National party\u2019s policy committee has defied Morrison by signing off on a plan to cost a proposal to boost Newstart. The modelling will reportedly examine the economic impact of raising the unemployment benefit, but quarantining 80% of the payment on a cashless welfare card, which can only be used for essentials. This week McCormack shot down calls to raise the Newstart rate from within his Nationals party room, instead urging jobseekers to move to regional towns to find work. On Sunday he said the National party policy committee \u201cwill continue to monitor the Newstart allowance but I believe the most meaningful thing we can do as a government is to provide the conditions under which business has the confidence to employ more people\u201d. Despite agreeing to call on the government to increase the rate, Labor caucus has not yet approved a proposal for a specific size of increase. The Labor MPs Mike Freelander and Nick Champion have endorsed calls for a $75 a week increase in the unemployment payment, which has been frozen at $275 a week for 25 years, a reduction of 40% in real terms according to the Australian Council of Social Services.",

Protesters surrounded the police headquarters chanting: \u201cBlack police\u201d \u2013 a reference to the triads, known in Chinese as \u201cblack societies\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about democracy as it is about trust,\u201d said Fong, 30. \u201cIf every Hongkonger chooses to stay at home, then we will surely die \u2026 This is the way Hongkongers show their trust to each other \u2013 by showing up and standing up for each other.\u201d Anger over last week\u2019s Yuen Long attack has added fuel to Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement, with additional rallies planned for Sunday. On Friday, thousands of protesters staged an 11-hour sit-in at the Hong Kong airport. Observers say escalated tensions raise the likelihood that Beijing will push the Hong Kong government to take a harder line on the protesters. In a rare move, police denied the demonstrators\u2019 application for the rally on Saturday in Yuen Long. Authorities also rejected a request to hold one on Sunday in Sheung Wan, near where police fired teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators who had defaced China\u2019s representative office in Hong Kong last week. Protesters have vowed to continue. Max Chung, who helped organise the rally on Saturday, said he believed residents had shown their resolve: \u201cHongkongers have stiffened their backs to say no to authoritarianism.\u201d",
