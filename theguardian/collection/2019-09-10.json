However, an amendment put forward by the rail union Aslef means the TUC will call for \u201cworkday campaign action\u201d instead. The UCU is urging workers to join the action alongside students at lunchtimes and before and after work, and to ask employers to jointly declare a climate emergency with staff unions and student unions.

The strikers are demanding their governments recognise the severity of the unfolding crisis and take appropriate action. This month\u2019s event comes days before world leaders meet in New York to discuss the climate crisis, and organisers said it was essential that adults join students on the streets to send an unequivocal message.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s rubbish,\u201d said Doreen Whitingham as she sat on a bench in Dudley Street, Wolverhampton\u2019s main shopping drag. \u201cThis place used to be brilliant for shopping. We had British Home Stores over there. That\u2019s gone. We had good little supermarkets and fruit and veg shops. All vanished. I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s crap now.\u201d Another shopper, Judith Baba, is sad rather than angry. She likes her trips into the city centre but says there are big gaps on the high street. \u201cPlaces like WHSmith aren\u2019t here in the city centre any more, which is strange,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t drive so have to rely on my daughter to take me to out-of-town places for some things. I think it\u2019s a pity.\u201d A report by the accountancy firm PwC and The Local Data Company suggests the chains are quitting Wolverhampton. According to the report, Wolverhampton experienced a net decline of 13 stores in the first six months of 2019, making it one of the hardest-hit city or town centres across Britain. The stores that have closed in that period range from Patisserie Valerie to the dessert emporium Icestone Gelato. A bike shop, nightclub, loan agency and calendar store also left town. Dudley Street is by no means devoid of shops. There is a Marks &amp; Spencer, the loss of which is often seen as the death knell to a shopping drag. There are busy fast food chains and fashion shops. But there are gaps. The corner site that Starbucks used to occupy is vacant, while between the Thorntons chocolate shop and Next there are two empty units, one grimly shuttered. One used to be an EE phone shop; the other a Foot Locker. That BHS site is being redeveloped and due to be taken over by the discount household goods stores B&amp;M and also a Wilko. And there is worse to come. In October 2017 excited Wolverhampton shoppers queued for the opening of a new Debenhams store in the Mander Centre. In April it was named as one of 22 branches that would be closing. The city council called it a \u201cshock.\u201d. And the future of the city\u2019s flagship department store Beatties (established 1877) is also in doubt. It is one of the House of Fraser stores bought by Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct \u2013 a chain which he has said was facing \u201cterminal\u201d challenges. Many of Beatties\u2019 shelves looked sparse and some areas were completely empty. The University of Wolverhampton has proposed buying Beatties and turning it into student digs, space for business startups and art exhibitions and for what it calls \u201cpop-up retail and leisure opportunities\u201d. Shopper Linda Woodall said the loss of Beatties would be a major blow. \u201cFor me, Beatties was Wolverhampton,\u201d she said. \u201cThis place is becoming all cafes and charity shops.\u201d However, is still possible to find interesting, thriving shops in Wolverhampton, if you know where to look. Places such as Oldies Unlimited, a specialist in rare records on Darlington Street. Simon Malpas, who runs the store with his father, Roger, said Wolverhampton used to have a reputation as a rough and ready sort of place. \u201cBut it\u2019s on the up.\u201d It doesn\u2019t surprise Malpas that some chains are leaving. \u201cThey can find cheaper rents and rates in the out-of-town places,\u201d he said. \u201cMore could be done to help keep the shops here.\u201d Further down Darlington Street, Blooms Menswear was bustling. It has operated for 60 years and has 25 full-time staff members. Blooms\u2019 director, Tom Vater, who has worked there since 1981, said Wolverhampton\u2019s high street faced a lot of competition, including a revitalised Birmingham a 20-minute train ride away, the out-of-town Merry Hill shopping centre 10 miles to the south and the internet. Vater said Blooms had prospered because, unlike high street rivals, it offered a bespoke, personal service. \u201cWe pride ourselves on it. We are a destination store,\u201d he said. The revamped market at the bottom of Snow Hill was also thriving. Housed in a bright collection of converted shipping containers, the market, which has been in existence since 1204, boasts no fewer than two fishmongers, at least half a dozen butchers, two Caribbean grocers, sari stalls and food takeaway stalls. \u201cPeople complain about the high street vanishing,\u201d said Jim James, who was buying pasties from the baker\u2019s stall. \u201cIt may just be that the high street\u2019s shifted out from the town and city centres into places like this. I reckon it can still be found if you look hard enough.\u201d The Labour-controlled city council said Wolverhampton retailers faced the same challenges as in many other places across the country. It said it was working hard to revitalise Wolverhampton through a range of developments and initiatives, ranging from a cinema, leisure and restaurant complex called Westside and a new state-of-the art railway station, due to open next year. The city also attracted headlines in the summer when the online retailer eBay opened a popup shop to showcase local small businesses \u2013 the first of its kind.",

      "bodyText": "Bacteria are increasingly developing ways of resisting antibiotics, threatening a future in which patients could become untreatable, doctors have warned. Over the last decade scientists in the UK studying samples from patients have identified 19 new mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. The changes in bacteria are driven by genetics and mean they become able to repel even entire types of \u201clast resort\u201d antibiotics, including carbapenems and colistin. For example, in 2016 an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhoea emerged, which posed a major challenge for hospital doctors and sexual health experts seeking to treat those affected. Over the same period no fewer than 12 new diseases and infections have been detected in England for the first time. Many have been brought into Britain by people who have picked it up abroad. These include swine flu, first detected in the UK in 2009, Ebola (2014) and the Zika virus (2014), but also lesser-known diseases such as Rift Valley fever (2013), Middle East respiratory virus (2012) and Monkeypox (2018). The two trends pose a threat to medicine\u2019s ability to keep patients alive and could drive up the annual death toll from antibiotic resistance, which stands at 2,200. \u201cInfectious diseases don\u2019t stand still. Bacteria are locked in an evolution race with antibiotics, constantly evolving new ways to avoid their impact,\u201d said Sharon Peacock, the director of Public Health England\u2019s (PHE) national infection service. PHE highlighted the worrying trends as it outlined plans on Wednesday \u2013 contained in its new strategy on infectious diseases \u2013 to improve the NHS\u2019s ability to identify and control them as far as possible over the next five years. Potential threats to health include the risk that globalisation and growing antimicrobial resistance may combine at some point to produce a global pandemic involving a previously unknown bug \u2013 what experts call the \u201cDisease X\u201d scenario. Prof Chris Witty, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said: \u201cDespite our arsenal of vaccines and antimicrobials, infectious diseases remain a real threat to public health. We are constantly faced with new threats, and antimicrobial resistance is growing.\u201d Over the last five years PHE has identified 32 \u201cpan-drug resistant bacteria\u201d that were able to resist all antibiotics thrown at them. PHE\u2019s warnings about the growing threat to health posed by infections comes as scientists report on Wednesday their discovery of a new strain of group A streptococcus bacteria. Experts say it may explain the big rise since 2016 in the number of children being affected by scarlet fever and throat infections, and warned that in some cases it can result in sepsis or toxic shock. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, has warned that rising antibiotic resistance is \u201cat risk of putting medicine back in the dark ages\u201d and could claim the lives of much larger numbers of patients than now. According to official estimates, there were 52,971 antibiotic-resistant infections recorded across the UK in 2015 and 2,172 deaths that were due to the person developing such an infection. In addition almost 80 disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people in England were lost to antibiotic-resistant infections. That captures the number of years in which someone has suffered poor health or disability, or died earlier than expected. Among European countries the UK ranks 13th for the number of disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people. PHE also believes that pandemic flu, declining numbers of people having recommended vaccinations and health inequalities are other threats to health over the next few years. Celia Ingham Clark, NHS England\u2019s medical director for clinical effectiveness, said: \u201cAs part of the long-term plan the NHS will reduce the use of antibiotics by a further 15% to keep them as effective as possible, for example by offering patients access to new treatments.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Retailers and unions are calling for urgent government action to help struggling high streets as new data shows the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty is rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. About 16 stores closed their doors every day in the first half of 2019 while only nine opened, resulting in a net decline of 1,234 chain stores on Britain\u2019s top 500 high streets according to analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and high street analysts the Local Data Company (LDC). The decline, which does not include independent shops, was faster than the net 1,123 closures during the same period last year \u2013 after just 222 in 2017 \u2013 and is the highest recorded since LDC began monitoring high streets in 2010. The shop closure data reflects a crisis on the high street that has cost tens of thousands of jobs. The retail industry employed 57,000 less people in the three months to the end of August compared to the same period a year before, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released on Tuesday. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of decline. Major chains including Karen Millen, Jack Wills, Bathstore, Patisserie Valerie and Debenhams have gone into administration this year after the collapse of House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld in 2018. Some of those chains are still in business, taken over by new operators after their collapse, but have closed outlets. Many other retailers, including Topshop owner Arcadia, Monsoon, New Look, Carpetright and Homebase have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills to stave off insolvency. \u201cThe government must address the growing crisis on our high streets,\u201d said Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, which has launched a Save our Shops petition. Usdaw, and some of the UK\u2019s biggest retailers including Tesco and Sainsburys, have demanded a review of business rates and other taxes to ensure there is a level playing field with online rivals. Last month, more than 50 major UK retailers, ranging from Marks &amp; Spencer to Harrods, Greggs and John Lewis wrote to chancellor Sajid Javid to demand an urgent review of business rates to safeguard the high street. They pointed out that retailers account for around 5% of the British economy but pay about 10% of all business taxes and about 25% of business rates. Usdaw also wants better support for communities and a minimum wage of \u00a310 an hour to help protect 4.5m jobs in the retail sector. The government recently increased its high street rescue fund by \u00a3325m to \u00a31bn, promising to pump extra money into 100 towns including Blackpool, Scarborough and Clacton. It has also announced \u00a3900m in business rates relief for small retailers and a taskforce of experts to assist local authorities in developing \u201cinnovative strategies to help high streets evolve\u201d. But retailers say a complete overhaul of property taxes is required to help fend off competition from online-only operators such as Amazon and Asos. \u201cHigh streets are undergoing a fundamental change in response to changing shopping habits, new technologies and rising costs of doing business, so it is vital that government supports the industry to make the necessary investment to adapt,\u201d said Dr Liliana Danila, economist at the British Retail Consortium. \u201cThe business rate system holds back investment, reduces productivity and increases regional disparities \u2026 The government must address the much-needed reforms to this broken tax system before more jobs are lost and stores are closed.\u201d Retail chains have been hit by a mix of low consumer confidence, which has cut spending, and rising costs from business rates, an increase in the legal minimum wage, and higher cost prices as a result of the decline in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. The rise of online shopping and a shift in how consumers spend their leisure time \u2013 towards spending more of their spare cash on holidays and dining and drinking at home \u2013 have also hit high streets and shopping malls. Fashion chains were hardest hit in the first six months of this year, with a net decline of 118 stores as chains such as New Look, LK Bennett, and Yorkshire-based menswear specialist Greenwoods either restructured or went bust, according to the PwC/LDC study. Restaurants, estate agents, pubs and bars also registered substantial numbers of closures. Wales was the hardest hit region, with a net 2.3% fall in store numbers \u2013 meaning one in every 44 stores in Wales closed its doors in the first half of this year. However, every region registered a decline in store numbers. The east of England, west and east Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber all reported declines of more than 2%, while Greater London and south-west England were just under 2%. \u201cThere\u2019s been no let-up in the changing ways that people shop and the cost pressures affecting high street operators,\u201d said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC. \u201cAs consumers continue to change the way they shop and spend their leisure time, the reality is that we may need fewer high streets in the future.\u201d There are some high street success stories.

He pulled off a shock success aboard Deirdre in Goodwood\u2019s Nassau Stakes last month, making her the first runner from Japan to win a British Group One race in 19 years, and the jockey is delighted to be climbing aboard her again.</p> \n<p>Even so, he had hoped to be able to ride in the Leger as well, until the <a href=\"https://www.racingpost.com/news/irish-champion-stakes-to-clash-with-st-leger-in-bid-to-avoid-all-ireland-replay/397927\">announcement that the Irish Champion</a> would be run two hours earlier than expected, partly to allow it to be shown on Japanese television. The Leopardstown contest will now start just 40 minutes after the Doncaster Classic, meaning jockeys have no hope of shuttling between the two as they have done in the past. Murphy smoothed things over with Andrew Balding, trainer of Dashing Willoughby, now to be ridden by William Buick.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s in super form,\u201d Murphy added of Deirdre, having partnered her on the Newmarket gallops on Tuesday morning in front of a contingent of Japanese media. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely in the same condition as she was leading up to Goodwood. She\u2019s very fit, that\u2019s for sure, and she\u2019s held her weight very well. I\u2019m thrilled, really looking forward to Saturday.

I\u2019m pleased Leopardstown have stepped in and made it possible for people in Japan to see the race. Obviously, I\u2019d have preferred if the race didn\u2019t clash with the Leger but that\u2019s a debate for another time. There\u2019ll be a lot of people in Japan watching this race.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 24-year-old Murphy has ridden more than 800 winners since arriving in Britain six years ago but has had few opportunities to impress in front of his home crowd and last year\u2019s Irish Champion, which he won aboard Roaring Lion, remains one of just two Irish successes to his name. The bookmakers make it a 12-1 shot that he will land the race again this weekend.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very competitive. I think Magical will probably go off favourite. If Deirdre runs to her Goodwood level, that\u2019ll make sure she runs a really good race and she\u2019ll be close but she\u2019s going to have to improve a little bit to win.\u201d He picks out Headman as a significant danger.</p> \n<p>This trip to Leopardstown is a brief diversion from Murphy\u2019s determined attempt to become champion jockey, a battle that will end next month, and he is not remotely tempted to take it easy at this late stage. \u201cI know I\u2019m 28 in front but I\u2019d like to keep riding winners. September is normally a very good month for Andrew and I\u2019d like to continue that.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Wednesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>The Kerry National looks as trappy as ever and I can\u2019t claim to be confident that I\u2019ve unravelled all the plots and subplots but, as with all the best handicaps, form study is its own reward and there are a couple of interesting ones at big prices.</p> \n<p>The general assumption about <strong>Valseur Lido (4.15)</strong> is that he\u2019s lost his way but he\u2019s still only 10 and sometimes these old boys have one last hurrah in them, especially if the handicapper gives them a chance. You might remember him as a blatant non-stayer in the last two Grand Nationals but he was within shouting distance of the lead before the home turn both times and his mark has since tumbled.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s 12lb below the rating he had in April and a whacking 26lb below the one he had at Aintree last year. True, it\u2019s three years since he won (when he stuffed Silviniaco Conti in a Grade One at Down Royal) but there have been flashes of ability, including at a late stage of the Bobbyjo Chase in February.</p> \n<p>Now he tries blinkers for the first time and a new jockey in Sean Flanagan might also have some effect. The stable\u2019s not in great form, they evidently prefer Poker Party and Valseur Lido is in the sales next week, so this might easily end in another flop but there\u2019s enough there for me to have an interest at 33-1.</p> \n<p>Drumcliff is the other interesting one, after a fair comeback from injury over hurdles last month. Somehow he\u2019s on the same mark as when beating 16 rivals at Uttoxeter last year and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a big handicap in him, though it doesn\u2019t have to be today. He\u2019s 25-1 and the market seems cool on him.</p> \n<p>The St Leger meeting gets off to a low-key start but it\u2019s good to see support for <strong>Equilateral (3.00)</strong>, who should be winning on this drop in class and appeals at 5-2. At Carlisle, <strong>Magic Timing (2.15)</strong> looks well treated for this handicap debut, with Joe Fanning and blinkers likely to prove helpful additions. He\u2019s 5-1.</p> \n<p>At Uttoxeter, <strong>Jaxlight (4.55)</strong> represents low-profile connections and still seems underestimated at 11-4 after last week\u2019s win.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"be9daed0-98b6-4575-afac-7007b857d8a9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Carlisle</b>&nbsp;1.40 Sendacard 2.15 Magic Timing (nap) 2.50 Avenue Of Stars 3.25 Flint Said&nbsp;No 3.55 Titanium Grey 4.30 Alotabottle 5.05 Royal Shaheen 5.35 Well Funded&nbsp;<br><br><b>Doncaster</b>&nbsp;1.50 Lazuli 2.25 Bravo Faisal 3.00 Equilateral 3.35 Dubai Acclaim 4.10&nbsp;Asoof 4.45 Willie John 5.20 Line Of Reason&nbsp;<br><br><b>Uttoxeter</b>&nbsp;<br>2.05 West To Crossgales 2.40 Mason Jar 3.15 Go Another One 3.45 Doubly&nbsp;Clever 4.20 Beni Light 4.55 Jaxlight (nb)&nbsp;<br><br><b>Kempton</b>&nbsp;5.30 Dream Catching 6.00 Pitchcombe 6.30 Mochalov 7.00 Strelka 7.30&nbsp;Withoutdestination 8.00 Manfadh 8.30 Purgatory&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

The stable\u2019s not in great form, they evidently prefer Poker Party and Valseur Lido is in the sales next week, so this might easily end in another flop but there\u2019s enough there for me to have an interest at 33-1. Drumcliff is the other interesting one, after a fair comeback from injury over hurdles last month. Somehow he\u2019s on the same mark as when beating 16 rivals at Uttoxeter last year and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a big handicap in him, though it doesn\u2019t have to be today. He\u2019s 25-1 and the market seems cool on him. The St Leger meeting gets off to a low-key start but it\u2019s good to see support for Equilateral (3.00), who should be winning on this drop in class and appeals at 5-2. At Carlisle, Magic Timing (2.15) looks well treated for this handicap debut, with Joe Fanning and blinkers likely to prove helpful additions. He\u2019s 5-1. At Uttoxeter, Jaxlight (4.55) represents low-profile connections and still seems underestimated at 11-4 after last week\u2019s win.",

      "bodyText": "The home affairs department ordered companies to preserve metadata and used warrants to access it \u201cwithout proper authority\u201d and twice unlawfully accessed stored communications, according to an ombudsman\u2019s report. In a sequel to the report revealing 116 illegal metadata searches by the ACT police, later admitted to number more than 3,000, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has declared that unlawful access by government agencies has \u201creduced significantly\u201d since 2016-17. But despite improved compliance, the ombudsman still found a litany of errors between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018 such as 31 instances of agencies receiving data outside the parameters of the authority, including 26 at the home affairs department. In 2015 law enforcement agencies gained the power to access individuals\u2019 metadata \u2013 information about a communication which does not include its content \u2013 when investigating certain offences, subject to oversight from the ombudsman. In its latest report, tabled in parliament on Tuesday, the ombudsman concluded that agencies were \u201cgenerally exercising their powers \u2026 appropriately\u201d but highlighted lapses including: In one instance Victorian police authorised metadata access that was \u201cnot for a permitted purpose\u201d and in two instances authorised requests for information that included content \u2013 although \u201cno information was received from the carrier\u201d in those cases. In 23 instances the Australian federal police used provisions authorising searches of information to find missing persons to gain information relating to criminal investigations. In four instances the AFP authorising officers took \u201cless than one minute\u201d to assess requests, calling \u201cinto question whether the [legislative] requirements could have been met\u201d. In the case of home affairs, the ombudsman identified \u201cinstances where preservation notices were given and stored communications warrants were applied for by a person who was not nominated to do so\u201d. Despite acknowledging the breaches were caused by \u201ca simple administrative error\u201d the ombudsman warned of \u201ccomplications \u2026 because stored communications had been obtained without the proper authority\u201d. \u201cThis presents a similar issue to that highlighted for the AFP, where the accuracy of authorisations and delegations can have significant flow-on effects.\u201d The ombudsman found home affairs officers did not have a proper delegation to authorise metadata access on 25 occasions, twice accessed data without proper authority and unlawfully accessed stored communications on two occasions. Three of 17 agencies audited unlawfully accessed stored communications because telecommunications carriers provided information which did not comply with conditions on the warrant or the data was not sufficiently identified as belonging to the person on the warrant. The ombudsman said that \u2013 despite carrier error \u2013 it is \u201cthe agency\u2019s responsibility to ensure it is only dealing with lawfully accessed stored communications\u201d and that information should be quarantined until they determine it is lawful to access it. The home affairs department disclosed that it gave a series of 56 historic domestic preservation notices to the same carrier over consecutive periods relating to the same person \u2013 a practice the ombudsman found had in fact occurred 100 times. While the practice is not \u201cstrictly in breach of any legislative provision\u201d, the ombudsman noted home affairs \u201cis not authorised to give ongoing notices because it is not an interception agency\u201d. Similarly, the AFP gave five consecutive foreign preservation notices in response to a foreign country\u2019s request to keep information to enforce a foreign law, using consecutive notices to overcome lack of authority to give an ongoing notice. The ombudsman also found that \u201ca number of agencies \u2026 have accessed telecommunications data outside an authorisation made under the [Telecommunications Interception and Access Act]\u201d, relying on an \u201calternative legislative basis\u201d and putting them outside its oversight. The ombudsman did not find any compliance issues in 2017-18 relating to access of journalists\u2019 metadata, which requires a warrant. In 2017 the AFP admitted an officer unlawfully accessed a journalist\u2019s call records without a warrant. The breaches of metadata laws by WA and ACT police, first reported by Guardian Australia in July, did not result in any disciplinary consequences, with top cops in both jurisdictions blaming administrative oversight. In the ACT, the director of public prosecutions concluded that illegally accessed metadata \u2013 although included in one brief of evidence for a prosecution \u2013 was not relied on to obtain the conviction.",

The federal government is under pressure to strengthen its proposal after a Greens bill to establish a body with much greater powers passed the Senate on Monday. The government\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog would consist of two arms: one overseeing the public sector and another covering law enforcement. The law enforcement arm would have largely the same powers and jurisdiction as the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which investigates corruption in the Australian federal police and the home affairs department, among other agencies. The Coalition\u2019s proposal would expand its remit to cover the tax office, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and the corporate and banking regulators. But Stephen Charles, a former Victorian court of appeal judge, has said the powers and jurisdiction of Aclei are insufficient to properly investigate corruption. He said it did not have the power to investigate ministers, former ministers, staffers, government contractors or the judiciary. Its lack of resources forced it to rely on the federal police for assistance, he said, creating a potential conflict of interest. \u201cThere are a multitude of ways in which Aclei is insufficient to fully investigate alleged corruption,\u201d Charles said.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning His comments coincide with an address to the national press club by shadow attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, who is expected to attack the Coalition\u2019s lack of progress on its integrity commission and reaffirm Labor leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s commitment to establishing such a body. Dreyfus said the Coalition was yet to produce even an exposure draft for its integrity commission, more than eight months after it was announced. \u201cIndeed, legislation to establish such a body is not even on the government\u2019s published legislative plan for the rest of this year,\u201d Dreyfus will say, according to a draft of his speech. \u201cAnd this is despite the fact at the time of the December press conference, the government claimed to have been working on legislation since January 2018.\u201d On Wednesday the Australia Institute released a report which found Aclei lacked the \u201cjurisdiction, power or resources to fully investigate alleged corruption\u201d. The report said it lacked the full investigative powers of a royal commission, had a limited definition of corrupt conduct, could not refer cases directly to prosecutors, and could not make findings of corrupt conduct. Aclei has the power to hold public inquiries but has not done so once, the report found. Earlier this year, the government referred allegations involving Crown to Aclei for investigation.

Crown has strongly denied those allegations, labelling the stories \u201cdeceitful\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Canadian man who spent five years held hostage in Afghanistan with his American wife has admitted striking her with a broom, but told a court in Ottawa that she asked to be hit, as his trial for sexual assault nears its conclusion. Under cross-examination by prosecutors on Tuesday, Joshua Boyle claimed he struck his estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman, several times in December 2017. But he had acted not out of anger, but because she frequently asked to be spanked. Boyle and Coleman, who married in 2011, were kidnapped by Afghan militants during a backpacking trip in 2012 and were transferred to the custody of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. Boyle has pleaded not guilty to assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement betweenOctober and December 2017, after the couple returned to Ottawa. Since taking the stand last week, Boyle, 36 has worked to counter the prosecution\u2019s depiction that he was a manipulative and abusive husband. He is also accused of administering a noxious substance. On Tuesday, he disputed accusations that he drugged Coleman with the anti-depressant trazadone, instead testifying he had offered her the drug because she was prone to \u201cfits\u201d. Hygiene routines \u2013 in disarray after five years in captivity \u2013 were a point of friction between him and Coleman, he said. He told the court that on 5 November \u2013 about a month after they were rescued by Pakistan security forces \u2013 Coleman flew into a rage when he suggested that she took a shower before meeting his parents. \u201cI don\u2019t remember if I invoked the fact both my mother and father had complained about Caitlan\u2019s hygiene,\u201d said Boyle. \u201cMeeting in public was often embarrassing for them.\u201d Earlier in the week, Boyle accused Coleman of \u201cincompetence\u201d as a mother, saying that while in captivity, Coleman would \u201cshut down\u201d, neglecting to feed their newborn or change diapers, prompting him to ask guards for food for the child. Even after the family was rescued in 2017 and brought to Canada, Boyle claimed Coleman would strike and violently shake their oldest child in their family\u2019s Ottawa apartment. In previous testimony from March and April, Coleman claimed Boyle was mercurial and violent, choking, punching and biting her. In addition to cataloguing numerous instances of sexual assault, she also alleged Boyle threatened to kill her \u2013 in front of their children. But during-cross examination, Boyle dismissed the accusation that he was manipulative in their relationship, suggesting Coleman\u2019s behaviour and accusations could be attributed to mental illness. He also claimed that his demands that Coleman maintain a certain weight and dress in a specific manner were merely \u201csuggestions\u201d that she could have freely disregarded. The trial, which began in March, has been marred by numerous procedural delays over what material \u2013 including Coleman\u2019s past sexual history \u2013 is admissible in court. The proceedings also came to a standstill in July after Coleman gave several interviews to media outlets about her time in captivity, despite an order from the judge not to discuss the case. The defence will question Boyle on Wednesday, with closing arguments scheduled for the end of September.",

Unlucky to see a late effort curl just wide. 5 Valon Berisha Two fine finishes from the Lazio winger gave Kosovo something to remember and exposed frailties in England\u2019s defence. Booked. 7 Vedat Muriqi The burly striker had a good game. Created both of Berisha\u2019s goals before winning and converting a penalty. 7. Substitutes Leart Paqarada Introduced at half-time. Booked for protesting too much about England\u2019s penalty. 6 Anel Rashkaj Helped to restore order after replacing Voca in the 59th minute. Booked. 6 Florent Hasani N/A (85min)",

San Marino spare the Scots from last place: hardly a promising scenario.</p> <p>To say Clarke is now in a different movie to the one he was recently starring in is a gross understatement. Having guided Kilmarnock to third place in last season\u2019s top flight, there was a perception the 56-year-old had the Midas touch as he swapped Rugby Park for international football in May. Belgium\u2019s 4-0 canter means Clarke has lost three of his first four matches in charge of Scotland, with the fact that the opposition has been stern doing little to dispel criticism. For Clarke, a coach previously immersed in club football, the month until Scotland\u2019s next match will be a test.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/09/scotland-belgium-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">Toothless Scotland crumble in face of Belgium\u2019s superior attacking class</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is the bit I have to get my head around,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to get used to international management.

My job is to stew on this, analyse the two performances [Scotland also lost to Russia on Friday] and try to improve us for the next game.</p> <p>\u201cI have to deal with the players that I have got, the players who are available. It is my job to work with the players we have and try to improve them as a team and move the country forward.\u201d</p> <p>A trait Clarke has inherited from previous Scottish regimes is the loss of soft goals. Successful Scotland teams of the \u2013 now distant \u2013 past were highly effective at being hard to beat. \u201cYou have to find the balance,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIt is a different level of football. With a club team you do get to work with them day in, day out, for weeks. You have training sessions where you can really drill them into this mentality.</p> <p>\u201cYou have players here who want to be attacking. You have to get the balance right. Yeah, we want to be difficult to beat, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we go to every game and sit in and defend. You have to remember that the games coming up, with the exception of Russia, who were in the last eight of the last World Cup, will not be as difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke also defended the Scotland support, who have been noticeably flat in recent times. \u201cIn terms of apathy I have always said that if we show the fans something \u2013 and obviously it is very difficult for them to believe having lost 4-0 at home \u2013 over the next four games they will be there in their numbers and will be right behind the team,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This doesn\u2019t feel like a time for learning curves, even if Steve Clarke concedes that is precisely what he is in the midst of. Scotland\u2019s meek capitulation against Belgium on Monday means Clarke now presides over a team who sit fifth in their European Championship qualifying section. San Marino spare the Scots from last place: hardly a promising scenario. To say Clarke is now in a different movie to the one he was recently starring in is a gross understatement. Having guided Kilmarnock to third place in last season\u2019s top flight, there was a perception the 56-year-old had the Midas touch as he swapped Rugby Park for international football in May. Belgium\u2019s 4-0 canter means Clarke has lost three of his first four matches in charge of Scotland, with the fact that the opposition has been stern doing little to dispel criticism. For Clarke, a coach previously immersed in club football, the month until Scotland\u2019s next match will be a test. \u201cThis is the bit I have to get my head around,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to get used to international management. The players will go back to their clubs, they will all be playing at the weekend, they will all be thinking about other things. My job is to stew on this, analyse the two performances [Scotland also lost to Russia on Friday] and try to improve us for the next game. \u201cI have to deal with the players that I have got, the players who are available. It is my job to work with the players we have and try to improve them as a team and move the country forward.\u201d A trait Clarke has inherited from previous Scottish regimes is the loss of soft goals. Successful Scotland teams of the \u2013 now distant \u2013 past were highly effective at being hard to beat. \u201cYou have to find the balance,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIt is a different level of football. With a club team you do get to work with them day in, day out, for weeks. You have training sessions where you can really drill them into this mentality. \u201cYou have players here who want to be attacking. You have to get the balance right. Yeah, we want to be difficult to beat, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we go to every game and sit in and defend. You have to remember that the games coming up, with the exception of Russia, who were in the last eight of the last World Cup, will not be as difficult.\u201d Clarke also defended the Scotland support, who have been noticeably flat in recent times. \u201cIn terms of apathy I have always said that if we show the fans something \u2013 and obviously it is very difficult for them to believe having lost 4-0 at home \u2013 over the next four games they will be there in their numbers and will be right behind the team,\u201d he said.",

All of which begs the question: how exactly did a blow-in from Kent prosper in New Zealand where highly talented inside backs are hardly a rarity? The answer, in Francis\u2019s case, was simple: the chance to rub shoulders with players such as Rieko Ioane, Sonny Bill Williams and George Moala and learn from them gave him a self-belief he had never previously enjoyed. \u201cI always felt the top was so far away where I was in England. The top level seemed almost unattainable.</p> <p>\u201cAt Maidstone I wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to play with someone like Billy Vunipola and have a conversation with him. If you\u2019re in London South East 2 you don\u2019t get the exposure to the top guys. In New Zealand you get Super Rugby players and All Blacks who come back and play for their clubs. Being exposed to those guys made the gap seem closer. It really stimulated me. I was thinking: \u2018They\u2019re not the gal\u00e1cticos I thought they were.\u2019 It fuelled the fire to keep at it.\u201d</p> <p>Playing Super Rugby developed the versatile skills and experience of southern hemisphere methods that, along with his appetite for hard work in the gym, clearly attracted Jones. Francis may not start the biggest World Cup fixtures but, either way, the management know they have a player who positively relishes a challenge. If he could offer young English hopefuls one piece of advice it is never, ever give up. \u201cHowever big things might seem at 16 years old don\u2019t let it go. Look where I am now.\u201d There is more than one way to the top if you want to ruck and maul badly enough.</p>",

I\u2019d train with the club on Tuesday and Thursday nights and play on Saturdays but I\u2019d also train with the academy at 5.30am, then go to work and train again in the evening.\u201d In the Auckland ITM Cup team at the time, coincidentally, were Gareth Anscombe and Hadleigh Parkes, both now based in Wales. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ironic \u2026 I was the No 10 behind Gareth for Auckland in 2011. I was really gutted about his injury last month. All of which begs the question: how exactly did a blow-in from Kent prosper in New Zealand where highly talented inside backs are hardly a rarity? The answer, in Francis\u2019s case, was simple: the chance to rub shoulders with players such as Rieko Ioane, Sonny Bill Williams and George Moala and learn from them gave him a self-belief he had never previously enjoyed. \u201cI always felt the top was so far away where I was in England. The top level seemed almost unattainable. \u201cAt Maidstone I wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to play with someone like Billy Vunipola and have a conversation with him. If you\u2019re in London South East 2 you don\u2019t get the exposure to the top guys. In New Zealand you get Super Rugby players and All Blacks who come back and play for their clubs. Being exposed to those guys made the gap seem closer. It really stimulated me. I was thinking: \u2018They\u2019re not the gal\u00e1cticos I thought they were.\u2019 It fuelled the fire to keep at it.\u201d Playing Super Rugby developed the versatile skills and experience of southern hemisphere methods that, along with his appetite for hard work in the gym, clearly attracted Jones. Francis may not start the biggest World Cup fixtures but, either way, the management know they have a player who positively relishes a challenge. If he could offer young English hopefuls one piece of advice it is never, ever give up. \u201cHowever big things might seem at 16 years old don\u2019t let it go. Look where I am now.\u201d There is more than one way to the top if you want to ruck and maul badly enough.",

Often when comedy stars \u201cgo serious\u201d, you can see the shadow of their funnier selves in every scene, but when taken out of his comfort zone, the Sandler we know virtually disappears. There was humour in both Punch-Drunk Love and The Meyerowitz Stories but it was awkward and intimate, more likely to make one shift in their seat than guffaw. Sandler has an under-appreciated ability to connect with the uncomfortable aspects of his more fleshed out characters, embarrassingly so at times, and his latest, arguably greatest, delve into drama pushes this to a whole new level.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/10/ford-v-ferrari-review-james-mangold-matt-damon-christian-bale\">Ford v Ferrari review \u2013 motor-racing drama gets stuck in first gear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He plays fast-talking jewelry dealer Howard Ratner, a man who spends his days frantically trying to make money while being followed by the men he owes money to, an exhausting lifestyle he can\u2019t seem to escape. But the more we get to know Howard, the less it seems like he wants to, forever inserting himself in increasingly precarious situations. Howard is the best, and worst, kind of antihero, caught in a trap of his own making, a way out always frustratingly in sight. As in Good Time, the Safdies have plotted out a perilous obstacle course for their protagonist involving the NBA player Kevin Garnett, a rare opal from an Ethiopian mine, a soon-to-be-ex wife and The Weeknd, and despite Howard continually testing our patience, we are unavoidably invested, sighing at his every misstep, figuring out whether we want him to succeed or fail.</p> <p>It\u2019s an intentionally stressful experience, not just because of Howard\u2019s aggressively frustrating character but because the Safdies take pleasure in our displeasure. The film packs in so many raised voices, blaring soundtrack choices and gaudy visuals that it often feels like a rather obnoxious sensory overload but we\u2019re never alienated because there\u2019s a deceptive delicacy behind these excesses. We\u2019re hurtling through the world that Howard lives and works in and it\u2019s not patronisingly translated or sanitised for us, it\u2019s just presented as is, and I admired how atmospheric they made it, a world I never once doubted.</p> <p>I also never once doubted Sandler, whose incisive character work here is probably the most impressive acting we have seen from him to date. It would have been far too easy to turn Howard into an overly mannered cartoon but Sandler opts for something far more precise and grounded. It\u2019s a performance entirely lacking in vanity \u2013 he makes Howard buffoonish at times, unpleasant at others \u2013 and despite being an immediately recognisable star, my idea of Sandler and what he represents quickly faded once the film began. It\u2019s a turn as immersive as the film around him and makes you crave more outside of his almost entirely useless Netflix deal.</p> <p>It\u2019s a remarkable match-up between film-makers and actor and reaffirms the importance of that partnership, especially for a movie star stuck in a profitable rut. Sandler deserves more, and if he wants us to keep watching, then so do we.</p> <ul> <li><p>Uncut Gems is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 13 December with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

There was humour in both Punch-Drunk Love and The Meyerowitz Stories but it was awkward and intimate, more likely to make one shift in their seat than guffaw. Sandler has an under-appreciated ability to connect with the uncomfortable aspects of his more fleshed out characters, embarrassingly so at times, and his latest, arguably greatest, delve into drama pushes this to a whole new level. He plays fast-talking jewelry dealer Howard Ratner, a man who spends his days frantically trying to make money while being followed by the men he owes money to, an exhausting lifestyle he can\u2019t seem to escape. But the more we get to know Howard, the less it seems like he wants to, forever inserting himself in increasingly precarious situations. Howard is the best, and worst, kind of antihero, caught in a trap of his own making, a way out always frustratingly in sight. As in Good Time, the Safdies have plotted out a perilous obstacle course for their protagonist involving the NBA player Kevin Garnett, a rare opal from an Ethiopian mine, a soon-to-be-ex wife and The Weeknd, and despite Howard continually testing our patience, we are unavoidably invested, sighing at his every misstep, figuring out whether we want him to succeed or fail. It\u2019s an intentionally stressful experience, not just because of Howard\u2019s aggressively frustrating character but because the Safdies take pleasure in our displeasure. The film packs in so many raised voices, blaring soundtrack choices and gaudy visuals that it often feels like a rather obnoxious sensory overload but we\u2019re never alienated because there\u2019s a deceptive delicacy behind these excesses. We\u2019re hurtling through the world that Howard lives and works in and it\u2019s not patronisingly translated or sanitised for us, it\u2019s just presented as is, and I admired how atmospheric they made it, a world I never once doubted. I also never once doubted Sandler, whose incisive character work here is probably the most impressive acting we have seen from him to date. It would have been far too easy to turn Howard into an overly mannered cartoon but Sandler opts for something far more precise and grounded. It\u2019s a performance entirely lacking in vanity \u2013 he makes Howard buffoonish at times, unpleasant at others \u2013 and despite being an immediately recognisable star, my idea of Sandler and what he represents quickly faded once the film began. It\u2019s a turn as immersive as the film around him and makes you crave more outside of his almost entirely useless Netflix deal. It\u2019s a remarkable match-up between film-makers and actor and reaffirms the importance of that partnership, especially for a movie star stuck in a profitable rut. Sandler deserves more, and if he wants us to keep watching, then so do we. Uncut Gems is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 13 December with a UK date yet to be announced",

      "bodyText": "Sancho was impressive ... Here are your player ratings ... Gareth Southgate knows it was not a perfect night ... And so that\u2019s your lot for this MBM. Our man Daniel Taylor was at St Mary\u2019s to witness this fizzy confection. Here\u2019s his report; thanks for reading this one. Nighty night! Gareth Southgate\u2019s verdict. \u201cThat was a bizarre game. Obviously some poor errors for goals. I\u2019m really pleased with the composure we showed to come back from our early mistake. Some devastating attacking play throughout. We used the ball really well. But the mistakes were obvious, there are areas where we need to do better. The outstanding parts of our play were obvious, the errors were obvious.\u201d Jadon Sancho, who scored his first and second goals as an international tonight, speaks to ITV. \u201cIt was a crazy game. Five goals, and I\u2019m happy to get two of them. I\u2019m just delighted to score my first goal for England. Scoring means a lot to me. I would like to dedicate my goals to my Nan, who was a big fan of me, but sadly she passed away.\u201d Those three points put England three clear at the top of Group A. They\u2019ve got 12 points from 12, and a match in hand over second-placed Czech Republic, who won 3-0 in Montenegro tonight. All of which means that England will qualify for Euro 2020 should they win in Prague next month. A trippy, psychedelic, positively lysergic match comes to an end. And they say qualifiers are boring. What entertainment! Another three points for England, who look great going forward, let\u2019s just leave it at that. 90 min +4: Took them a while, though. It\u2019s fair to say they\u2019ve made this harder than it needed to be. 90 min +3: No, it looks as though England have finally established a level of control. 90 min +2: Can Kosovo find a fourth? Oh go on. There can\u2019t be a single football fan out there who doesn\u2019t want to witness the mind-bending madness that would follow. There just can\u2019t be. 90 min +1: The first genuine lull of the match, so here\u2019s a polite request from Stuart Reid. \u201cAny chance you could remind your gentle readers that it is 0-0 between Grimsby and Macclesfield in the Carabao Cup?\u201d 90 min: A corner out on the left. Chilwell and Sterling play it short, and faff about. There will be five additional minutes. Can\u2019t there be 55? 88 min: Celina dances in from the left and is inches away from curling one into the bottom right. Pickford was beaten. Now that would have set up quite the denouement. 87 min: At the start of the aforementioned move, Rashkaj planted his studs on Mount\u2019s knee. He was booked, but should have been sent packing. Thankfully Mount is fine to continue. 86 min: Rashford nearly makes an instant impression, whipping down the left, cutting inside, and battering a low shot goalwards. Muric parries, but only to Sterling ... who unbelievably scoops over from six yards! He was offside, as it goes, but still. 85 min: And now Rashford replaces two-goal Sancho. Meanwhile Kosovo\u2019s own two-goal hero, Berisha, is swapped for debutant Hasani. 84 min: Mount comes on for Barkley. 83 min: Berisha is booked for petulantly kicking the ball away, having been penalised for tugging back Sterling on the halfway line. Utterly pointless. 81 min: Both sides are looking a wee bit tired as a result, though. Quite a few misplaced passes in promising positions, as the teams basketball their way up and down the pitch. 79 min: England respond with some sterile possession of their own. It\u2019d be wrong to describe the period as a lull, though. Nobody\u2019s let up from the get-go. 77 min: Kosovo push England back, enjoying plenty of possession in the opposition half. But the hosts hold firm in the final third as the visitors probe. St Mary\u2019s is slightly nervous now, with England fans sensing there\u2019s more absurdity surely in the post. It\u2019s just one of those nights. 75 min: The resulting corner is worked towards Henderson on the right. Henderson bursts into a gap and whips high towards the near post, where Keane flashes a header wide. Yeah, not sure how there\u2019s only been eight goals in this. 74 min: The ball\u2019s at Sterling\u2019s feet in the Kosovo box again. He\u2019s swarmed by defenders, but manages to dig out a no-backlift shot that\u2019s deflected and squirts inches wide of the bottom left. Not sure how - ahem - there\u2019s only been eight goals in this. 72 min: Rashkaj blooters wildly over from distance. Then England go up the other end, and nearly make it six. Muric plays a dreadful ball out to Halimi, who is easily robbed by Kane. England\u2019s captain slides a pass to the left for Sterling, free in acres. Sterling draws Muric and tries to slot into the bottom left. But his shot deflects off the keeper\u2019s leg and off the left-hand post! This match is preposterous. 71 min: Alexander-Arnold tries to curl one into the bottom right. He sets it out to the right of the wall, but it doesn\u2019t come back. Goal kick. 70 min: Sancho makes his way towards the Kosovo area. Aliti hangs out a cynical leg and puts a stop to his gallop. That\u2019s a yellow card, and a free kick 25 yards out, just to the right of centre. Alexander-Arnold looks like he fancies this. 68 min: It\u2019s not often I get to type these words on an MBM, so I\u2019ll take the opportunity while I can. I don\u2019t think this game is going to end 5-3. 67 min: In a parallel universe somewhere, Sterling has just scored two in two minutes. First he dribbles sweetly down the middle, but can\u2019t get a worthwhile shot away upon reaching the box. He probably should have laid off to Kane or Barkley. Then he\u2019s inches away from getting a head on a fine Alexander-Arnold right-wing cross. 65 min: It\u2019s an age before the penalty is taken. Halimi is booked for dissent, then Paqarada follows him into the book for encroachment. Then Kane takes ... and Muric saves! Kane fired his penalty towards the bottom left. Muric reads well, parries then snaffles. He was off his line, but there\u2019s no VAR, so no second chance for Kane! Is anything else going to happen in this match? 63 min: Barkley turns past Rashkaj and embarks on a Gazzaesque dribble down the middle, all power and poise. He reaches the box and is bundled over in the clumsy style by Rrahmani, who is booked for the trouble. 61 min: I wonder if there\u2019s anybody out there who doesn\u2019t want Kosovo to score the next goal? Nah, can\u2019t be. 59 min: Kosovo make their second change, swapping Voca for Rashkaj in the midfield. \u201cAs they also proved in the summer, and at the World Cup, England are a bit hooky at the back to say the least,\u201d argues Michael Gibbons. \u201cThat will get exposed in a major championship, because the knockout rounds are rarely negotiated with a succession of ice-hockey scores.\u201d 57 min: Berisha wanted to take that penalty, incidentally. Chances of international hat-tricks don\u2019t come along every day. But Muriqi wasn\u2019t having it. St Mary\u2019s is a cauldron right now. This is pure, unadulterated fun. Muriqi slots the ball into the top right. Just. It wasn\u2019t tight in the corner, and Pickford got a good hand to it. But not a strong one. Look at this preposterous scoreline! 53 min: Space for Berisha down the right. He rolls the ball into the box for Muriqi, who takes a touch on the edge of the box. Maguire slides in. He should intercept, but misses the ball, and hanging his leg out for a second time, taps Muriqi on the ankle. The big striker goes over, refusing to look this gift horse in the mouth. 51 min: Nope, he pulls it back for Henderson, who floats a ball into the box, easily claimed by Muric. Not a great couple of minutes for the Liverpool captain. 50 min: Barkley is bundled over by Vojvoda, 30 yards out on the left. It looks like Barkley fancies spanking this one goalwards himself. Scrub that about learning from their mistakes. Rice needlessly gives the ball away in midfield, allowing Kosovo to pour forward. Muriqi powers down the right before scooping a wonderful cross towards the left for Berisha, who takes a touch inside to see off Henderson with ease, then curls an unstoppable effort into the top right! Three minutes and 25 seconds it took him this half. 47 min: Kane sprays a fine pass down the right for Alexander-Arnold, who brings the ball down, spins and hammers a shot goalwards. Wonderful technique ... but straight at Muric, who parries. 45 min 35 sec. England haven\u2019t conceded in this half yet. Always learning from their mistakes. Some magnificent footage of Bernard Challandes, who thought Sancho was offside for England\u2019s fifth goal. He stormed off down the tunnel frowning fiercely and screaming in impotent frustration. \u201cTERRIBLE!\u201d he hollers at the top of his voice ... before catching a nearby camera and flashing an instant - and genuine - smile. The guy\u2019s a true character, you can\u2019t help but love him. Anyway, he\u2019s replaced Muslija with Paqarada, and we\u2019re off again. England get the ball rolling for the second period. Half-time entertainment. For those fond of 5-1 scorelines involving England. This match has been prorogued for 15 minutes. They don\u2019t survive them. Chilwell clips a pass down the left for Sterling, who knocks it past Rrahmani and zips into space. He makes it all the way to the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, then carefully dinks the cutest of crosses over the outstretched Muric towards Sancho, who can\u2019t miss from six yards. 45 min: Kosovo really need to hear the whistle. They\u2019ve got another three minutes to survive, though. Rice breaks up a Kosovan attack inside his own half. The ball breaks to Henderson, who immediately slides a pass down the left to release Sterling into acres. Suddenly England are four on two. Sterling slips the ball right for Sancho, who scores his first goal for England by taking a touch before sliding it past Muric in the fuss-free style. England are lovely to watch in full flow. 42 min: Aliti is good to continue, by the way, so no concerns there. 41 min: I\u2019m not even sure England were aware of Aliti\u2019s plight. Especially as the defender eventually got up again before the goal was scored. But on the touchline, manager Bernard Challandes isn\u2019t too happy about it, and talks himself into the book. Aliti and Alexander-Arnold come together on the halfway line. Aliti comes off worse, and goes down. England don\u2019t put the ball out - they\u2019re not obliged to - and off goes Sancho down the right. He reaches the byline, amid a cacophony of irate Kosovan whistling, and fires a low cross across the face of goal. Vojvoda, a couple of yards out, is taken by surprise, can\u2019t sort his feet out, and diverts the ball into the net. Oh dear. 37 min: Vojvova drives with purpose down the right and smacks a low shot towards the bottom right. It billows the side netting with Pickford sliding across in a panic. He probably had it covered. 36 min: Some space for Chilwell down the left. His cross, intended for either Kane or Sancho, is wayward. 34 min: Sterling jinks and jiggles down the left to win England another corner. This one finds Chilwell at the far post, but the header\u2019s no good. Miles over. 33 min: Now it\u2019s Kosovo\u2019s turn to play a little keep-ball. They don\u2019t really go anywhere, but that\u2019s not really the point. A statement of their collective confidence, the sort you\u2019d expect when on a two-year unbeaten run. They look a really tidy side. And on that subject, here\u2019s our old pal Simon McMahon. \u201cA plucky underdog raising their game and performing with heart and skill against a footballing superpower. It\u2019s enough to bring a tear to a glass eye. Makes me proud to be Kosovar.\u201d Satire, there, ladies and gentlemen, coming at you live from Dundee. 31 min: Berisha drops a shoulder and drifts in from the right. He sends a speculative effort goalwards. It\u2019s deflected, and heading out for a corner on the right, but Pickford does extremely well to slide over and stop the ball crossing the white line. 30 min: Henderson bursts through a little gap down the middle and very nearly finds Sterling just inside the area with a cute chip. It\u2019s read well by Aliti, who intercepts and clears. 28 min: England play keep-ball in the middle of the park. So composed, so very continental these days. Properly European, if you will. 26 min: Barkley is bundled over 30 yards from goal. He takes the free kick himself, sending a high floater towards Maguire, loitering on the right. But the big defender is beaten to the ball by Hadergjonaj, the lack of pace on the free kick England\u2019s undoing. 25 min: The Kosovo fans continue to make a hell of a noise. This match has been wonderfully entertaining, with a soundtrack to match. 23 min: Sancho busies himself down the right and lays off for Barkley, who sends a shot-cum-cross harmlessly over the bar. England look dangerous every time they go forward. 21 min: You\u2019ll not be surprised to hear that Kosovo aren\u2019t finished yet. They respond to falling behind by causing more bother in the England box, Berisha chesting down a pass to the left of goal and sending an overhead kick past the confused faces of Keane, Chilwell and Pickford. Nobody gets a touch, but English hearts were in mouths there. There was enough confusion, that could easily have been deflected in. This is a wonderful goal. Sterling turns and wriggles out of trouble in the centre circle, an electric eel, then barrels down the middle. He slips a pass to Kane on the left. Kane enters the area, takes a touch to get rid of Vojvoda, and slams a low shot between Muric\u2019s legs and into the net from a tight angle! 18 min: Muric miscontrols a simple backpass and for a brief moment it looked like the ball was going to apologetically trundle into the empty net. But despite Sancho applying pressure, the keeper runs back and hacks clear. 16 min: Barkley turns Voca with indecent ease on the halfway line, and burns off down the inside-left flank. He tees up Sterling on the edge of the box. Sterling uncharacteristically gets his feet in a tangle, and Hadergjonaj is eventually able to clear. But for a split second there, Sterling\u2019s eyes had lit up. 15 min: Sterling romps down the middle of the park and is inches away from releasing Kane on the right with a cute diagonal pass. Up the other end, Vojvoda is granted a little bit too much space out on the right. He can\u2019t find anyone with a looping cross, and Alexander-Arnold clears. 13 min: Kosovo aren\u2019t taking this lying down, though. They promised to attack, and having already delivered, here they come again. Voca slips a ball down the right for Muslija, who can\u2019t get his cross past first-man Maguire. Muriqi was lurking in the middle. This isn\u2019t going to end 1-1. 12 min: Chilwell takes the corner he\u2019d earned, hanging it high, and it\u2019s easy pickings for Muric in the Kosovo goal. 11 min: England have responded marvellously to that early nonsense. They\u2019ve absorbed the shock in the professional, proactive style, and are dominating right now. Maguire Beckenbauers his way down the middle and very nearly slips Kane free down the left channel. Not quite. Then Chilwell comes down the left flank, his low cross hysterically hacked out for a corner by the Kosovo captain Rrahmani. 9 min: Can England play at Southampton all the time, please? This is great fun. ... Keane does indeed make up for his dreadful error! Barkley hits the corner long. Keane rises high above Rrahmani, heading deliberately back across goal, where Sterling is able to expertly guide a header past Muric from six yards. What a start! 7 min: Sancho tears off down the right and earns the first corner of the match. Keane comes up, looking to atone. Barkley takes, and ... 6 min: England stroke the ball around the middle for a bit. A chance to clear their heads. Keane gets a couple of touches, which he probably needs after that San Marinoesque opening blow. 4 min: Sterling scampers down the left in a let\u2019s-sort-this-out style. He nearly gets past Voca but the Kosovan stands firm, refusing to budge, eventually clearing. 2 min: Goodness knows what Keane was thinking about then. He had been played into an awkward spot by Barkley\u2019s pointless backpass, it\u2019s true, but the pass to Maguire was never on. But never mind! Let\u2019s think of the greater good: St Mary\u2019s is bouncing as a result, and we have a game on here! He\u2019s played a piss-poor pass towards Maguire, easily intercepted by Muriqi, that\u2019s what. Suddenly Kosovo are two on one! Muriqi slips a simple ball down the inside left for Berisha, who opens his body and sidefoots powerfully past Pickford and into the bottom left! Wow! And we\u2019re off! Kosovo get the ball rolling. A fantastic atmosphere in St Mary\u2019s. And what\u2019s Keane done here, 34 seconds in? The teams are out! Kosovo - bedecked in blue and black - stand for their anthem, hands on heart. Then the English one. You know how it goes. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! A party atmosphere ahead of the game. Both sets of fans appear to be getting on like a house on fire. Here are a couple of Kosovo supporters politely jigging around to the racket made by a local brass band. Well, you can\u2019t be rude to your hosts, can you? Some nice late-70s retro kit on show, there, as well. Saints should bring that one back. Or any other of the McMenemy-era shirts, really, they had a run of crackers back then, Rank Xerox, Draper Tools, all that. An imperial phase of clobber. And now a word with the equally amiable Gareth Southgate. \u201cWe were pleased with the performance of Marcus Rashford and both of the full-backs, but we have some good players to come in. The wide areas are a heavy load, and we freshen the group. Jadon Sancho is a very exciting player in an area of the pitch where we have a few. We love taking games on the road, we want the rest of the country to see the team, it\u2019s a different type of atmosphere. This will be a proper test for us.\u201d Kosovo boss Bernard Challandes drips with charm as he\u2019s interviewed by ITV. All smiles and passionate rhetoric, his energy is infectious. He\u2019s given a bit of a hospital pass with the first question - is he disappointed to play England as they go on tour around the country? - but deals with it admirably. He admits a pang of disappointment for his players, many of whom will have long dreamed of playing at Wembley, but adds diplomatically: \u201cFor me as coach, it\u2019s a game for qualification, and perhaps to play here is better, I don\u2019t know! But we play against England, the pitch is very good, and the stadium is very nice. Why not a surprise? One chance, it\u2019s football! But I am realistic, I see England score five, five and four. We must play and take risks!\u201d You\u2019d need a heart of stone not to wish his side well. England\u2019s young guns have already done their bit against Kosovo. The under-21s won 2-0 in Hull last night, Phil Foden the star turn. Those desirous of more detail can slake their raging thirst for knowledge by clicking below. The inner sanctum. Hats off to Southampton for giving the dressing room at St Mary\u2019s a bespoke makeover. England will play in their famous white shirts this evening. Kosovo will therefore be good for their first-choice blue, though nothing\u2019s certain these days, we\u2019ll get back to you if the folk from their marketing department have forced them into second-choice yellow or third-choice black. Meet tonight\u2019s opponents. Kosovo face England for the first time in their history this evening. They make two changes to the side named against the Czechs, with Florent Muslija and Valon Berisha stepping up. Goalkeeper Arijanet Muric, on loan at Nottingham Forest from Manchester City, midfielder Bersant Celina of Swansea City, and Huddersfield Town defender Florent Hadergjonaj all start. No surprises there. England boss Gareth Southgate makes three changes to the team that swatted Bulgaria aside on Saturday. Jadon Sancho comes in for Marcus Rashford up front, while the full backs are rotated: Trent Alexander-Arnold replaces Kieran Trippier, while Danny Rose makes way for Ben Chilwell. James Maddison and Tyrone Mings sit on the bench, hoping to make their debuts tonight. England: Pickford, Alexander-Arnold, Keane, Maguire, Chilwell, Henderson, Rice, Barkley, Sancho, Kane, Sterling. Subs: Heaton, Gomez, Mount, Wilson, Mings, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Pope, Trippier, Maddison, Winks, Rashford, Rose. Kosovo: Muric, Vojvoda, Rrahmani, Aliti, Hadergjonaj, Voca, Halimi, Muslija, Celina, Valon Berisha, Muriqi. Subs: Kryeziu, Zhegrova, Rashani, Nuhiu, Ujkani, Dresevic, Bernard Berisha, Raskaj, Bekaj, Leart Paqarada, Hasani. The way things have been going recently, you\u2019d expect England to do well at St Mary\u2019s tonight. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve won their first three Group A qualifiers to the aggregate tune of 14-1; they\u2019ve won 33 of their last 42 qualification matches, drawing the others in a ten-year unbeaten run; and they\u2019re unbeaten in 29 competitive home fixtures staged away from Wembley, a sequence that stretches back to 1936. Then again, opponents Kosovo are on a pretty decent run of their own. They\u2019re unbeaten in 15, a stretch that goes back nearly two years. Having just beaten Bulgaria 3-2 and the Czech Republic 2-1, they\u2019re looking to make it three wins on the bounce in Group A. And they might take a little historical comfort from the result of England\u2019s one previous visit to Southampton in the Euro qualifiers, a 2-2 draw with Macedonia in 2002. Kosovo boss Bernard Challandes isn\u2019t making any bold claims, mind. He\u2019s of the opinion that England are \u201cthe best team in the world\u201d, though he is hoping that his \u201cvery young team ... show what is a very, very high level\u201d. Gareth Southgate\u2019s similarly youthful side won\u2019t be taking this one lightly, but they will hope to make it four wins from four and consolidate their position at the top of the group. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 7.45pm BST.",

What Cottin delivers, though, is by no means a tribute act to Waller-Bridge. To call her elegant would be insufficient. Cottin has a whole munitions depot of self-possession and chicness that gives her performance a more knowing, and also more mournful, edge. At 40, she\u2019s older than Waller-Bridge was, but she doesn\u2019t have more maturity \u2013 just less goofiness.</p> <p>Cottin\u2019s breakthrough show, Connasse, came out in 2013. The timing of her next TV show, Call My Agent, was fortuitous: with the benefit of subtitles and Netflix distribution, Cottin reached an international audience for the first time. Call My Agent, about a talent agency, has been a fantastic calling card, illustrating how much greater Cottin\u2019s range was than \u201cclown\u201d. It generated a lot of discussion, partly by being great, and partly because it was, as she says, the first prime-time French drama to feature a lesbian whose \u201chomosexuality was not the subject. The subject is how it is hard for her to commit to a relationship, because what she likes is the act of seduction.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 11 September. Top stories Donald Trump has fired John Bolton, his national security adviser, in tweets which laid bare searing internal divisions within his inner circle, saying he had \u201cdisagreed strongly\u201d with his top aide. The president\u2019s firing of his third national security adviser in as many years appears to have caught even the White House by surprise. Bolton himself added to the confusion, commenting minutes after his public dismissal that he had offered to resign on Monday night but that Trump had replied: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u201d \u201cTrump hired Bolton to break things, like the Obama administration legacy and the orthodox foreign policy establishment in general. Now, with the 2020 election coming, a downturn looming and a second presidential term in doubt, Trump is trying to build a foreign policy legacy of his own \u2013 or at least a reasonable impression of one,\u201d writes Julian Borger. Here\u2019s how Bolton\u2019s departure is likely to affect US foreign policy. The EU is looking to the Northern Ireland-only backstop to break Brexit deadlock, pinning its hopes on British negotiators reverting to the approach that was previously rejected by Theresa May as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK. With Boris Johnson facing a choice between breaking his word and extending the UK\u2019s EU membership beyond 31 October or bringing back a tweaked deal for a last-gasp vote in parliament, officials and diplomats have expressed hope that the prime minister will make a U-turn. Environment department officials were acutely sensitive about meeting Angus Taylor over critically endangered grasslands while his family\u2019s company was being investigated for alleged illegal land clearing in New South Wales, according to internal emails. The information is revealed in correspondence that had previously been partially redacted from documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. It comes after Labor again pursued the energy and emissions reduction minister in question time on Tuesday and called on him to resign over the saga. Former Liberal leader John Hewson has called on Scott Morrison to grant government MPs a conscience vote on a motion declaring a climate emergency. Hewson, who will join MPs on Wednesday to champion the new parliamentary motion which is being pursued by the Greens and is supported by most of the lower house crossbench, told Guardian Australia there was no controversy associated with declaring a climate emergency in 2019, \u201cbecause my view is it was an emergency 30 years ago\u201d. World Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he will annex large swathes of the occupied Palestinian territories if he is re-elected, a decision that for decades has been considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians\u2019 aspirations of statehood. A Turkish newspaper has revealed Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s last words before he was apparently drugged and lost consciousness. The Saudi journalist urged his killers not to cover his mouth because he had asthma and could suffocate, according to Turkey\u2019s Sabah newspaper. An Iranian female football fan has died a week after setting herself on fire outside a courtroom after learning she may face six months in prison for trying to enter a stadium, a news agency reported on Tuesday. The operator of the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant will have to dump huge quantities of contaminated water from the site directly into the Pacific Ocean, Japan\u2019s environment minister has said. Gwyneth Paltrow has been revealed as a \u201ca crucial source\u201d in the Harvey Weinstein revelations, in a new book which says the actor was scared of going on the record at first but then encouraged other women to speak out. Opinion and analysis Photographer Robert Frank, who has died aged 94, helped to change the direction of photography. The Swiss-born photographer\u2019s seminal book The Americans, which had an introduction from author Jack Kerouac, featured 83 pictures rejecting many conventions of photography up to that point. The black-and-white images are considered Frank\u2019s masterwork and focused on figures from the overlooked margins of American life \u2013 from teenage couples and factory workers to bikers. Dubbed the \u201cManet of the new photography\u201d by the New Yorker critic Janet Malcolm, Frank was considered the father of \u201cthe snapshot aesthetic\u201d, which captures a spontaneous moment taken on the fly. Can we save the world, one tree at a time? asks Van Badham. Bushfires are raging across Queensland and NSW. At the same time Australia faces a land-clearing crisis, although we know that deforestation drives more forests to burn, writes Badham. \u201cAnd this is why both habitat protection and active reforestation and revegetation has to be prioritised by governments \u2013 at all levels \u2013 in the pressing climate fight. The battlefront is not only to save the forests we have left, but to properly revegetate the spaces humanity has already taken over \u2013 for while wildlife areas perish, cities are also warming.\u201d Sport The Socceroos have earned a comfortable 3-0 win over Kuwait in the opening 2022 World Cup qualifier. In front of a hostile away crowd, Australia showed no signs of rust despite only playing one game since January as they surged at the hosts\u2019 backline at the Al Kuwait Sports Club Stadium on Tuesday night. England\u2019s Jimmy Anderson believes he can become the world\u2019s No 1 Test bowler once more. To make this goal a reality, he now plans to study how other elite athletes prolong their careers. Thinking time: The French Fleabag Mouche, or the French Fleabag, is a near replica of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s hit TV series, with Paris taking the place of London and Camille Cottin in the title role. What Cottin delivers, though, is by no means a tribute act to Waller-Bridge. To call her elegant would be insufficient. Cottin has a whole munitions depot of self-possession and chicness that gives her performance a more knowing, and also more mournful, edge. At 40, she\u2019s older than Waller-Bridge was, but she doesn\u2019t have more maturity \u2013 just less goofiness. Cottin\u2019s breakthrough show, Connasse, came out in 2013. The timing of her next TV show, Call My Agent, was fortuitous: with the benefit of subtitles and Netflix distribution, Cottin reached an international audience for the first time. Call My Agent, about a talent agency, has been a fantastic calling card, illustrating how much greater Cottin\u2019s range was than \u201cclown\u201d. It generated a lot of discussion, partly by being great, and partly because it was, as she says, the first prime-time French drama to feature a lesbian whose \u201chomosexuality was not the subject. The subject is how it is hard for her to commit to a relationship, because what she likes is the act of seduction. The fact that she likes women is completely accepted.\u201d Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s front page announces the cashless welfare card has \u201cfailed\u201d. The Australian reports that there isn\u2019t enough water available to conduct major environmental flows in the northern Murray-Darling River basin, and that environment minister Sussan Ley is \u201cbracing the public for horrendous environmental consequences in coming months.\u201d The ABC reports: \u201cThe most powerful bureaucrats in Australia have been wargaming to prepare the country for \u201cnational-scale systemic climate risks\u201d that could impact \u201cthe full spectrum of human activity\u201d and are already \u2018overwhelming\u2019 the country\u2019s ability to respond.\u201d Coming up Friends of the Biloela Tamil family stuck in detention on Christmas Island will go to Parliament House with more than 250,000 signatures supporting their release. The shadow attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, will give a speech at the National Press Club titled \u201cTime\u2019s up: why Australia needs a national integrity commission\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A surprising but delightful win for Michael! And a tough break, comme une breadstick, for Amelia. Bread week never disappoints. Thanks to all of you for the amazing lookalikes and puns and arcane regional helmet trivia. Standard. I\u2019m definitely tuning in next week to see what the drama is between Steph and Henry, and also because of certain contractual obligations. Please join me then! In the meantime come say hello on Twitter or Insta. Or if you want me to name my firstborn after you, buy my book!* Ciao x * remains childless, dies alone, has the last laugh WHAT is that drama between Steph and Henry?? They may as well have cued the Eastenders drums after that cliffhanger. Whhaaaa! Delighted. Our cherub is all growed up. Amelia goes home of course. She was good in previous weeks, so definitely leaves with no shame. Michael Owen has only seen eight films and one of them is Seabiscuit Who\u2019s won this do we think? I am too out of my mind to have any idea. I assume Rosie? @lobster1 David as Michael Owen is a good shout. Especially because Michael Owen is a FASCINATING cultural figure. Michael\u2019s done well enough. Like a seasoned theatre-goer hitting the cloakroom before the encore, Amelia makes a bid to go home early. But will anyone be joining her? Self assessment is a tax joke. Do you understand the riches I am giving you? Shoutout to HMRC A-Dora-ble Steph\u2019s loaf structure is beautiful, say the judges. Michell\u2019s garden of Welsh nationalism tastes delicious, though she suffers from a stodgy hedgepig. We\u2019ve all been there. Fougasse just sounds impolite doesn\u2019t it. The judges love Rosie\u2019s varied bread art, and she gets some nigh perfect scoring of her own. To David\u2019s credit he actually did not do very well. He must be freelance: because his self-assessment was spot on. Lots of don\u2019t. Not sure about any of the do\u2019s.\u201d Bread Dread Michael is SUCH a phrase-maker. We love him and Henry best, yes? Phil IS Johnny Vegas. Very good. @orbitalgirl matcha is definitely on the bingo. Matcha three from three to win a year\u2019s supply of bitter grass powder! Perfect David thinks he\u2019s in trouble. Are we buying that? I\u2019m not sure I am. Sandi\u2019s heartbreak jumper! Need. Especially now I know Helena has a husband. Amelia loses then locates her bread-scoring prison shiv. Big Sandi cedes the wing to her. Has anyone ever made that bread that proves using yeast from the air? I harbour ambitions. Amelia is making some sort of Victorian World Fair of flying bread saucers? It\u2019s...a lot. Wait, Phil is making a winner\u2019s wreath? That is hubris in a herby pretzel. Any Geordies in the house? What do we make of Noel\u2019s attempt at the accent? Knock it back, but not vigorously. Treat it like a lady.\u201d QUITE a lot to unpack there, from Phil. Did you know that on actual Halloween, goths dress as normos? Beige chinos and Boden. I find it very moving. That\u2019s right, cricket joke! A rich seam for me. Great swing from Noel, whacking a dough cricket ball to the boundary . Ironic that Fielding should be best at the crease. \u2018Scoring bread\u2019 is more or less the pitch for the whole show isn\u2019t it. This is huge A doughy diorama to take the crown! Paul and Prue discuss sending two bakers home. Scary, spicy times for Amelia. Rosie as \u2018glum golden retriever\u2019 also made me very un-glum @brolene @caroline700 Amelia as Scary Spice and Rosie as Bob from Blackadder are EXCELLENT. Take a cinnamon bun to the top of the class That\u2019s an excellent vocal warm up, if nothing else. A lost Gilbert &amp; Sullivan lyric. A little LEGO stationmaster, looking after a rural railway stop Amelia and Phil bring up the rear with their uneven buns. Steph and David\u2019s tight baps impress, but turns out Henry IS a bap sort of character. Good job, little lego man! What\u2019s a Scooby Doo burger? Is it drug slang? Henry is essentially a LEGO approximation of a man. Oh here\u2019s an unspecific one- Noel looks like a present day Muhammed Ali, I think? David\u2019s pert buns do look glorious. Nothing wrong with small baps. Though I imagine Paul likes them oversized. When you play a game of racially specific lookalikes, you win or you die HEAR ME OUT ON THIS ONE but Priya is M.I.A? Helena? I will not accept Penelope Cruz, we can do better. I think Helena Bonham Carter I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019re a bap sort of character,\u201d Noel psychoanalyses Henry, before recognising it\u2019s got weird. To file with: never worth making your own. See also hummous Michelle is Sian Clifford the Fleabag sister, right? Where\u2019s Wally? Seventh Heaven Steph is dry, Rosie soft. Michelle self-identifies as RUSTIC! It counts. Drink a drink. Michael\u2019s red bread is a beauty, and earns a proper Hollywood Handshake. Double drink! Oh my, I want Helena\u2019s cinnammon roll and the fact this isn\u2019t even a euphemism speaks volumes How can anything taste too much of pesto? I would IV pure pesto. Oh, hold that thought Michael: Where\u2019s Wally My brain no work so good tonight. Shall we do lookalikes for the bakers please? I\u2019ll start. @whatthedeauce Rosie\u2019s voice is really something isn\u2019t it. I find it earwormy. I don\u2019t even know if I like it, but could listen to it all day. Too pale!\u201d \u201cVery dark but good!\u201d Bakers getting their bread out of the oven like Floridian pensioners comparing tans. Amelia hates cheese?? Well it was nice knowing her. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you like cheese it\u2019s wonderful?\u201d Backpedalling so hard she just passed Victoria Pendleton. Noel\u2019s bread legs! Marvellous. And you thought the Mighty Boosh would never make a comeback. Henry has made backgammon breasts or something OOOH I could murder a cinnamon roll. Love them. Heavy on the cinnamon. *Plays Nina Simone\u2019s Sinner Man as a weak compromise* Alice is making...baklava? Je ne comprends pas. She may as well squeeze out a tiramisu. Is Amelia\u2019s harissa chorizo scenario going to be too heavy to rise? Don\u2019t tell me my putative bride Helena does crossfit Why are they all doing fitness things? I feel sick Puns: The entire bingo should have been puns! Noel smuggling a juggling into bread week was a welcome treat. Rosie adjusting a hospital drip into her dough was profoundly Hannibal. Why is no one talking about it Michael is a FITNESS INSTRUCTOR? That doesn\u2019t add up at all. I\u2019m not totally convinced Jamie made it home last week. I bet if you zoom out the window he\u2019s in that field, grazing among the sheep. AKA a night you\u2019d rather forget I wondered if Henry would be wearing a full morning suit this week. WAIT. Does Alice think Munch\u2019s The Scream is a painting of the mask from the Scary Movie movies? You can learn a lot in four days.\u201d Henry already more qualified than our political leaders. That\u2019s right, satire Michael has Bread Dread! He\u2019s our champion, isn\u2019t he? Quite a prison vibe with that montage of homemade shivs The Ch4 presenter is getting on the pun game! AND the Amazon Alexa ad. Tonight\u2019s wordplay is gonna be off the (kitchen) scale. @Darbles can you scatter the floor with polenta to soak up the oil? This is not legal advice @Greatismynewt as I expected, things are getting yeasty below the line already. Good work How does this work again? Oh yes, a drinky bingo! Prue more or less accusing someone of being born in a barn Paul gauging levels of crust-browning against his own skin David pouting like a Ariana Grande Sandi \u2018Tom Cruise\u2019 Toksvig talking about aliens Paul breaking someone\u2019s boules My body is trying to simultaneously co-exist at noon and 8pm, like a low-rent episode of Doctor Who. Anyway, how are we all? What are we eating and drinking? Also: I have just got off a plane from America. The jet lag being so profound that I believe myself to be legally mad at this present time. Or would if I knew what the time was. @kiikiireads terrible puns are my bread and butter Welcome to the GBBO live blog. It\u2019s bread week, you crumby rat finks!* This is always a big week in the tent. Nowhere to hide in bread, is there? Unless you\u2019re a mouse. With bread, one can\u2019t just whack a load of fondant icing over the mistakes. Which bakers will prove their worth, and who\u2019ll be eating sourdough grapes? I\u2019ll be writing up tonight\u2019s best bits live. Please get involved below the line with prurient gossip and grandma\u2019s recipes and all caps slanders. Actually, not the last one. Sorry for calling you all rat finks. I love you. The show starts at 8pm, so I\u2019ll see you back here then!",

      "bodyText": "MPs looking to stop no deal are exploring ways to bring back a version of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal plus a vote on a second referendum in the last two weeks of October, amid concerns Boris Johnson will still try to pursue a no-deal departure. Several sources told the Guardian that MPs will spend the next few weeks working on ways to bring back the deal \u2013 with added concessions to Labour \u2013 to the House of Commons via a backbencher or a temporary prime minister. MPs working on the options said more Tory and former Tory MPs were now open to backing a Brexit deal with a second referendum added, taking parliament closer to a cross-party majority for the plan. One former Tory MP said the option was under consideration and would \u201ccertainly have to be linked to a referendum\u201d. He added: \u201cWe will know in those two weeks whether it is possible or not.\u201d Another former Tory said: \u201cThere is an element of seeing what the next step is from No 10.

It comes as Ken Clarke, the veteran Tory who had the whip withdrawn last week, urged Johnson to \u201cput together a cross-party alliance to get a deal through,\u201d as he believed it could now achieve a majority with Labour MPs who regretted having not voted for it previously. The father of the House told the Byd yn ei Le programme on Welsh-language channel S4C that he would be willing to be an \u201chonorific figurehead\u201d for an alternative government seeking such a compromise if Johnson does not stitch together a deal. In scathing remarks about the state of politics, he described both Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as representing \u201can absurd choice for the premiership of this country\u201d and said the situation was the worst crisis in his political lifetime, amounting to a \u201ctragic farce\u201d. Parliament has repeatedly failed to find a compromise, but there are signs more opposition MPs are prepared to countenance voting for a deal. A separate cross-party group of opposition MPs formally launched a campaign to win support for Brexit via a managed deal on Tuesday. The founders, who include Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb and former Tory MP Rory Stewart \u2013 claimed up to 50 MPs may back the plan. Their proposal would involve using elements of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit legislation as the basis for an agreement which Boris Johnson could steer through parliament, possibly in time for a 31 October departure. Those supporting a second referendum would try to amend any proposal for a deal to secure a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Several MPs who support the people\u2019s vote campaign said an increasing number of Tory MPs were coming around to the idea of a confirmatory referendum to break the impasse, including Sir Oliver Letwin, who told the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday: \u201cIf [Boris Johnson] can\u2019t get a deal that he can bring to the House of Commons and get a majority for, there\u2019s another option of course, which is to bring back a deal and ensure a majority for it by attaching it to a referendum. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s a huge number of Labour MPs, Liberal Democrat MPs, SNP MPs, who would vote for any reasonable deal subject to a referendum and I think there\u2019s now an increasing number of Conservatives and ex-Conservatives who would as well, so I think there is a majority there too.\u201d The Labour frontbench would be sceptical about voting for any deal that was not negotiated by a Labour prime minister but could come under pressure from many of its MPs and members to compromise if it achieved a second referendum. Any such moves would increase pressure on Johnson to get his own deal with the EU and on Eurosceptic Tories to back him rather than risk a second referendum. There is still a possibility that the prime minister could climb down on his demand to entirely replace the backstop with another solution and settle for a more minor tweak to the political declaration, before putting that fresh deal to a vote and challenging the Eurosceptic holdouts to vote for it or lose the whip. However, he has so far been insistent that what he calls the \u201cantidemocratic backstop\u201d must be removed while the EU is adamant that is not possible, leading to a stalemate on his prospects for a negotiated deal.",

Aged 37 and the most successful seamer in Test history, Anderson could be forgiven for feeling he has no more mountains to climb after the calf injury that flared up on the opening morning at Edgbaston and wrecked his involvement in the Ashes series this summer. But such thoughts appear far from his mind with the winter tours to New Zealand and South Africa looming. And while fitness has scarcely been an issue before \u2013 his 575 Test victims owe as much to his longevity as his unquestionable skill \u2013 Anderson will double down in this department. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and investigate every possible avenue of what I need to do at my age to keep myself in good shape,\u201d said Anderson, who topped the Test bowling rankings as recently as December last year. \u201cI feel as fit as I ever have.

It said the iPhone 11 Pro would last four hours longer than the iPhone XS, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max five hours longer than the iPhone XS Max. Both iPhone 11 Pros also ship with a faster 18W charger in the box, something others have been doing for years. Apple has also improved its Face ID facial recognition system, implemented the new wifi 6 standard and faster wireless charging. One big missing feature for the iPhone is support for the latest 5G networks, which recently launched in the UK, US and elsewhere. While the availability of the new significantly faster mobile networks is limited at the moment, the rollout is expected to reach many major towns and cities by the end of 2019. Samsung, OnePlus and other predominantly Chinese smartphone manufacturers all have at least one 5G model on sale, giving them a significant advantage in the new era of mobile connectivity. Last year\u2019s iPhone revision ditched the old-style design with home button for the iPhone X-like screen, adding the larger, but cheaper 6.1-inch iPhone XR and 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max at the top end. But from launch until the end of June, that range of iPhones sold 26% fewer handsets globally than the iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus the previous year, according to data from Canalys, with three straight quarters of shipment decline. With a trade war between the US and China likely to affect Apple\u2019s growth in the Chinese market, and potentially increasing the cost of the iPhone elsewhere thanks to tariffs, the next few years may prove difficult. Apple will be banking on the top-end appeal of its most expensive iPhone 11 Pro to continue where the iPhone XS Max left off, while the cheaper iPhone 11 appeals to a wider market by competing more directly on price with the likes of Samsung. The iPhone 11 will cost $699 in the US (\u00a3729 in the UK, A$1,199 in Australia), $50 less than the iPhone XR from last year. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max will cost from $999 (\u00a31,049 in the UK, A$1,749 in Australia) and $1,099 (\u00a31,149 in the UK, A$1,899 in Australia), and will ship on 20 September.

The company is announcing new studies to follow-up on the widespread heart research they ran last year: one looking at hearing damage, using the watch\u2019s microphones to assess noise levels; another looking at menstrual cycles, partnering with with the Harvard school of public health; and a third looking at \u201chow metrics from Apple watch can serve as early warning signs to help improve overall health\u201d relating to heart function. </p> <p>The research is all opt-in for US residents, who can sign up using the new Apple Research app. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d77db6e8f083106f45590e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T17:28:14.752Z\">6.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">iPad</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cook turns to the iPad, and talks up iPadOS.

The mid-range iPhone 11 gets the twin-cameras of the XS, while the high-end iPhones Pro keep on top with three cameras. What for? Nobody knows! Or at least, nobody understands. More speculatively, some are suggesting an iPhone SE 3, with the low-end phone updated to resemble the iPhone 8.</li> <li><strong>New Watches</strong>. The Apple Watch ticks onwards to Series 5. The software suggests it\u2019ll support sleep tracking, though whether the hardware has the battery life to justify it is another question. If you\u2019re rich, you\u2019ll be able to buy a version in a ceramic shell. Oh! And Siri will be more capable, including being able to Shazam songs for you \u2013 we learned that in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/06/apple-rewrote-siri-to-deflect-questions-about-feminism\">the same batch of documents</a> that revealed Apple\u2019s fear of the word \u2018feminism\u2019.</li> <li><strong>New laptops? </strong>Rumours of a refresh to the MacBook Pro line have been around a while: Apple is clearly developing something which shrinks the bezels around the screen even further, fitting a 16 inch display in the same case as the current 15 inch model. Hopefully the disastrous Touch Bar is also being quietly sent off into the night. But will we see it launched today?</li> <li><strong>Apple Arcade and TV+</strong>: The services announced in June will be launching soon, alongside iOS 11 and Mac OS Catalina. The big question? Price. $9.99 for TV+ is a steep ask for any service with as few shows as Apple has \u2013 and that\u2019s if they were good.

      "bodyText": "And with that, we\u2019re done. A recap, then I\u2019m off: Three new iPhone 11s, in vanilla, pro and pro max flavour. They all have a new ultra-wide-angle camera, and night mode for those low-light shoots. The Apple Watch Series 5, with an always-on screen. A new basic iPad, with a larger screen and support for the Apple Pencil. Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ pricing \u2013 a fiver a month in euros, pounds and dollars. But free Apple TV+ for a year if you buy a phone, laptop, iPad or Apple TV. More bad news for Brits: the $999 iPhone 11 Pro is \u00a31049, and the $1099 Pro Max is \u00a31149. Again, VAT means it\u2019s not quite as simple, but those prices are going to sting. Thank the Brexit pound. And that\u2019s it! Tim says goodbye to the audience, goodbye to us at home, and signs off. So the rumoured MacBook Pro update remains missing in action, but there was one surprise, for those keeping track: the free year of Apple TV+ that gets bundled with every new Mac, iPad, iPhone and Apple TV. That could help the company gain a foothold in this market, but equally will raise some awkward questions in this new age of technology anti-trust enforcement. Also there is a new (refurbished) Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York. This has been your update on the Apple Retail Experience. Now we get the boring stuff: Deirdre O\u2019Brien, who took over from Angela Arendts, is on stage to talk about the Apple Retail Experience. You can now choose your watch strap when you buy an Apple Watch. And you can use your current iPhone as credit towards your new iPhone, she says. The iPhone 11 Pro will start at $999 and $1099 for the Max. Pre-order starts on Friday at 5am Pacific Time, and they\u2019ll be on shelves from September 20th. Also, the old iPhone 8 gets a price cut to $449. Filmmakers can shoot from two lenses at once (with pro camera apps like Filmic, that is), which, some filmmakers assure me, is actually pretty cool. There\u2019s a new font in the camera app! New buzzword alert! The iPhone 11 Pro has \u201cDeep Fusion technology\u201d, which lies behind the Night Mode, \u201cpixel by pixel optimising for detail and low-noise\u201d. Schiller calls it \u201ccomputational photography mad science\u201d, Google will call it \u201cwhat we did last year\u201d. Schiller walks through a few sample shots. Most interesting is the speed of the lenses \u2013 smartphones have got good at zooming over the years, but not at high-speed photography. That looks like it\u2019ll change. The camera(s)! Three lenses: 12MP wide, 12mp telephoto, and 12mp ultra-wide. So you\u2019ll be able to go from 0.5x zoom to 2x zoom, and get all the same night shift stuff that you also get on the iPhone 11. Apple is branding the iPhone 11 as \u201c2x optical zoom out\u201d, which is cheeky; I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll have the gall to call this a \u201c4x zoom\u201d, though. The battery! It \u201clasts 4 hours more than iPhone XS\u201d and, on the big one, \u201c5 hours more\u201d than the old big one. (Wow, that\u2019s actually a huge increase.) Someone is talking about the A13 bionic chip. It has 8.5 billion transistors. If you need the loo, now\u2019s the time. Phil Schiller comes up to talk about the phone. \u201cThe first phone we\u2019ve called Pro\u201d, he points out. It comes in \u201cmidnight green\u201d, \u201cspace grey\u201d \u201csilver\u201d and \u201cgold\u201d, comes in two sizes, 5.8\u201d and 6.5\u201d, and has an \u201cincredible new display\u201d that is brighter and more colourful than ever before. So it\u2019s been rebranded, from Super Retina to Super Retina XDR. \u201cBut what if I want to spend more than a thousand pounds on my phone?\u201d Good news! Apple is here for you: Tim Cook introduces the iPhone 11 Pro. It has three cameras. Price! The iPhone 11 starts at $699. That\u2019s $50 less than the starting price of the iPhone XR. The iPhone 11 will have \u201can hour more battery than the iPhone XR\u201d, apparently. Good improvement! But it\u2019s been years since Apple quoted these metrics in absolute numbers. The XR was \u201can hour and a half longer than the iPhone 8 Plus\u201d; the 8 Plus was \u201cabout the same as iPhone 7 Plus\u201d, which was \u201cup to 1 hour longer than iPhone 6s Plus\u201d. Someone is showing off a game to demonstrate how powerful the GPU is. The game looks bland but pretty. In the meantime, we\u2019ve started to get the UK pricing through, and friends, it is not pretty. The $329 iPad is going to be priced at \u00a3349 in the UK, while the Apple Watches are at parity \u2013 $399 becomes \u00a3399 and $499 becomes \u00a3499. Yes, the US prices are exclusive of tax while the UK ones include VAT at 20%, but, ouch. Now we get a bit of talk about the silicon inside the phone. It\u2019s called the A13 Bionic, is \u201cthe fastest CPU inside a smartphone\u201d and also has \u201cthe fastest GPU inside a smartphone\u201d, and until there are some independent benchmarks, we\u2019ll basically have to take that on trust, but it\u2019s probably true enough \u2013 Apple\u2019s in-house chip design is market-leading. Important new feature! The iPhone 11 can take front-facing portrait mode shots in landscape to fit more people in the frame. You can also now take slow-mo videos with the front-facing camera for perfect hair-flicking video if you want hair-flicking video. The big one. \u201cCustomers love iPhone,\u201d Cook says, stubbornly refusing to use the definite article because Apple\u2019s branding doesn\u2019t allow for it, before introducing another video. Interestingly, Apple is starting with the iPhone 11 \u2013 the base model, an update to last year\u2019s iPhone XR. Kayann comes on to walk us through the iPhone. (Again, Apple is too cool to say who she is.) It has an LCD screen \u2013 as in, not an OLED screen \u2013 and two cameras: a 12mp wide-angle camera, and a new 12mp ultra-wide-angle camera. The company\u2019s branding it, in-app, as \u201c0.5x zoom\u201d, so you \u201ccan capture way more without moving,\u201d Kayann says. It\u2019s cool, but I don\u2019t know if many smartphone photographers have felt that the already-very-wide-angle cameras on their phones are too zoomed in. More importantly, of course, the two cameras improve the portrait mode on the phone, adding stereoscopic depth of field. That\u2019s why they exist in the first place, really. And they enable another new feature: \u201cnight mode\u201d. The company is using smart long exposures to get high clarity in low light, without (it says) blurring. The wide angle lenses will help there: broadly, the shorter the focal length, the more light can get to the sensor. (Worth noting that Google\u2019s Night Shift on its Pixel phones has existed for a year, and been one of the best features on that iPhone competitor for all that time) What wasn\u2019t mentioned about the Series 5 Apple Watch? Anything about the silicon that powers it. Presumably, the internals are largely the same as the generation before, explaining how the always-on screen doesn\u2019t hit battery life. What else for the Watch? A built-in compass, which improves the mapping apps, and also allows for an actual compass app. International emergency calling for the cellular model. More straps, colours and cases. Look, the always-on screen was a big deal, they can\u2019t all be like that. The audience is clapping for a black leather strap. The new watches start at $399, or $499 for cellular models, and they\u2019ll hit shelves on September 20. The Series 3 watch \u2013 that\u2019s 2017\u2019s model \u2013 gets a price cut to $199. Almost cheap! Stan Ng comes onstage to talk about the new Apple Watch. The big difference about the Series 5? The display is always on, albeit dimmed most of the time. Apple says it\u2019s managed to do that with new display technology that allows for it to maintain an 18-hour battery life. Cook introduces the Watch segment with a video of people talking about how the Apple Watch has changed their lives \u2013 focusing, largely, on the health benefits. It\u2019s sweet, if sentimental, and gets to the point: this tech is saving lives, warning users of heart failure and calling ambulances following a bad fall. Cook returns, and invites Sumbul Desai to talk about a more systemic change the Watch enables: mass-participant health research. The company is announcing new studies to follow-up on the widespread heart research they ran last year: one looking at hearing damage, using the watch\u2019s microphones to assess noise levels; another looking at menstrual cycles, partnering with with the Harvard school of public health; and a third looking at \u201chow metrics from Apple watch can serve as early warning signs to help improve overall health\u201d relating to heart function. The research is all opt-in for US residents, who can sign up using the new Apple Research app. Cook turns to the iPad, and talks up iPadOS. The company, you may remember, is spinning the iPad version of iOS off into its own family. It means a few more iPad-specific software tweaks, but currently it\u2019s largely branding. More importantly, there\u2019s an upgrade to the cheap, base-level iPad. The new, 7th generation iPad is getting a larger screen (10.2\u201d, up from 9.7\u201d), and support for the Apple Pencil and Smart Connector, which lets users attach Apple\u2019s own keyboards to the device to turn it into a pseudo-laptop. It\u2019ll cost $329 for the base version, and\u2019ll start shipping on September 30th. More importantly, Apple TV+ is launching (in more than 100 countries) on November 1, with new shows launching every month. And it\u2019ll cost $4.99 a month. And! A year\u2019s subscription comes free with any Apple product. Which feels like how the majority of people will get access to this service, to be honest. The reviews are in: the trailer for See really is bad Cook\u2019s back, reintroducing Apple\u2019s streaming service. The trailers for its shows have been viewed more than 100m times, he says, which, fine. He shows new trailer for See, a Jason Momoa-helmed sci-fi epic about a postapocalyptic world where everyone is blind. It looks \u2013 I am sorry Jason \u2013 absolutely terrible. \u201cWe have a huge morning for you, with some truly big announcements,\u201d Cook says, mercifully dispensing with his \u201cusual updates\u201d, and launching straight into Apple Arcade, introducing Ann to introduce the service. (Apple is too cool to use surnames and I don\u2019t know who Ann is.) Ann walks us through some of the features of Apple Arcade that we were already told about in March, before introducing a few developers to walk us through their new games. Konami introduces a remake of arcade classic Frogger, exclusive to Apple Arcade. The developer\u2019s script is awful. \u201cWhoa! What is that! Is it a giant baby with sunglasses?!\u201d Yes, it is a giant baby is sunglasses, you made the game, you should know this. Capcom introduces Shin Sekai: Into the Depths, an underwater platformer, exclusive to Apple Arcade. Annapurna Interactive introduce Sayonara Wild Hearts, a fantastic rhythm action game the company describes as \u201ca playable music video\u201d. It\u2019s not exclusive to Apple Arcade \u2013 it\u2019s coming to Switch too \u2013 but it\u2019s easily the best of the games shown (I played the Switch version at E3 in May). But the real news: Apple Arcade launches on September 19, worldwide, with 100+ games for $4.99 a month. \u201cFor the whole family\u201d, too \u2013 no password sharing, and a one month free trial. \u201cWe hope you have a blast playing all the incredible games on Apple Arcade\u201d, says Ann, handing back to Tim. (Update: Ann is Ann Thai. Thanks Apple!) As ever, we open straight into a video made for the event, this time showing an impressionistic overview of, well, the history of Apple, from the Macintosh to the new Mac Pro, via clickwheels, trackpads and airpods. The message, if there is one: evolution, not revolution. \u201cGive people wonderful tools, and they\u2019ll do wonderful things\u201d, a caption reads, and Tim Cook takes the stage. How leaky is Apple? This leaky: New iPhones, plural. The XR, XS, and XS Max will all see updates, and rumoured new names too: the iPhones 11, Pro and Pro Max. What to expect? The mid-range iPhone 11 gets the twin-cameras of the XS, while the high-end iPhones Pro keep on top with three cameras. What for? Nobody knows! Or at least, nobody understands. More speculatively, some are suggesting an iPhone SE 3, with the low-end phone updated to resemble the iPhone 8. New Watches. The Apple Watch ticks onwards to Series 5. The software suggests it\u2019ll support sleep tracking, though whether the hardware has the battery life to justify it is another question. If you\u2019re rich, you\u2019ll be able to buy a version in a ceramic shell. Oh! And Siri will be more capable, including being able to Shazam songs for you \u2013 we learned that in the same batch of documents that revealed Apple\u2019s fear of the word \u2018feminism\u2019. New laptops? Rumours of a refresh to the MacBook Pro line have been around a while: Apple is clearly developing something which shrinks the bezels around the screen even further, fitting a 16 inch display in the same case as the current 15 inch model. Hopefully the disastrous Touch Bar is also being quietly sent off into the night. But will we see it launched today? Apple Arcade and TV+: The services announced in June will be launching soon, alongside iOS 11 and Mac OS Catalina. The big question? Price. $9.99 for TV+ is a steep ask for any service with as few shows as Apple has \u2013 and that\u2019s if they were good. Early indication suggests that this slate\u2026 is not. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog of Apple\u2019s autumn press conference. We\u2019ll be kicking off at 10am Pacific Time \u2013 that\u2019s 6pm UK time, and 3am in New South Wales if you\u2019re staying up for all the latest news. If you want to watch along live, Apple is streaming the event on its YouTube page for the first time, and you\u2019ll find the video embedded above. If you want to kill time, you could watch some of the other videos on their page, including a bizarre series of \u201cASMR\u201d clips of people working wood or going walking. Otherwise, stick around, and we\u2019ll try and work out together how it takes two hours to launch some phones, watches and laptops.",

      "bodyText": "The National Rifle Association sued San Francisco on Monday over the city\u2019s recent declaration that the gun-rights lobby is a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization\u201d. The lawsuit, filed in US district court for the northern district of California, accuses city officials of violating the gun lobby\u2019s free speech rights for political reasons and says the city is seeking to blacklist anyone associated with the NRA. It asks the court to step in \u201cto instruct elected officials that freedom of speech means you cannot silence or punish those with whom you disagree\u201d. Last week, the San Francisco board of supervisors passed a resolution calling the NRA a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization\u201d, contending the group spreads propaganda that seeks to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence. \u201cThey continue to stand in the way of gun violence reform and people are dying because of it,\u201d said Catherine Stefani, the San Francisco supervisor who drafted the resolution not long after a mass shooting at a garlic festival in nearby Gilroy, California, left three people dead. Despite the troubling drumbeat of mass shootings across the country, the overall gun homicide rate in San Francisco has dropped 49% over the past decade, a much more dramatic decrease than in the country as a whole. But the lifesaving success of local gun violence prevention programs rarely gets much attention in America\u2019s national gun debate, which is driven more often by headline-grabbing confrontations between gun rights and gun control activists, like the one San Francisco\u2019s board of supervisors kicked off last week. In the past months, the NRA has been hobbled by money troubles and vicious internal infighting, including a bitter legal battle with its own longtime public relations firm Ackerman McQueen. The group\u2019s powerful chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, left the organization in June, after being accused of conspiring against the NRA CEO, Wayne LaPierre. For the embattled gun rights group, public condemnation from a group of liberal California lawmakers appears to have come as a welcome distraction. The group\u2019s Twitter feed has been full of updates on the lawsuit, along with videos from a diverse selection of NRA members, declaring, \u201cI am not a terrorist.\u201d \u201cThis action is an assault on all advocacy organizations across the country,\u201d William A Brewer III, the NRA\u2019s lawyer said. \u201cThere can be no place in our society for this manner of behavior by government officials. Fortunately, the NRA, like all US citizens, is protected by the first amendment.\u201d San Francisco\u2019s resolution follows some recent high-profile shootings, including one in Gilroy, California, about 80 miles south-east of San Francisco, where a gunman entered a festival with an AK-style long gun, killing three people and injuring 17 before killing himself.

      "body": "<p>Apple has launched a new version of its popular smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 5, with an always-on display.</p> <p>Unveiled on stage at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Tuesday, the new version features a similar design to the Apple Watch Series 4 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/12/apple-watch-series-4-will-have-edge-to-edge-screen-and-health-features\">launched this time last year</a> but with a new screen that can remain on all the time.</p> <p>To enable the always-on display, which many other smartwatches have had for several generations, Apple said it is using the first LTPO display, which it claims allows the screen to refresh dynamically from as high as 60Hz to 1Hz, alongside a new display controller and ambient light sensor.</p> <p>Apple said the Series 5 still has 18-hour battery life with the screen continuously on. The watch again comes in 44mm and 42mm sizes, with options for 4G connected versions, and Apple\u2019s ECG heart monitor. There are also a series of new colours, straps and case options, including titanium and ceramic ones.</p> <p>The new watchOS 6, announced in June, will also enable more functionality independent of the iPhone.</p> <p>Apple is also continuing its health focus for the watch, which now includes menstrual cycle tracking as part of watchOS 6. It has also launched a research app, with three health research studies \u2013 hearing, women\u2019s health, and heart and movement. The app will allow anyone to enrol and will roll out in the US later this year. Apple said it cannot access information that directly identifies you through the app.</p> <p>The Apple Watch has become a sleeper hit, capturing the lion\u2019s share of the small but increasingly important smartwatch market almost immediately on launch in 2015. Since then the line has increased sales year by year, providing an extra revenue stream alongside the firm\u2019s AirPods wireless earbuds, as people continue to hold on to their smartphones for longer and longer.</p> <p>Apple sold 43m Apple Watches over the last two years, according to data from IDC, accounting for nearly 50% of the global smartwatch market.</p> <p>The new Apple Watch Series 5 will start at \u00a3399 in the UK or $399 in the US, with 4G models costing from \u00a3499 or $499, shipping on 20 September. Apple is also keeping the older Series 3 available and dropping its price to \u00a3199 in the UK, $199 in the US.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Apple has launched a new version of its popular smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 5, with an always-on display. Unveiled on stage at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Tuesday, the new version features a similar design to the Apple Watch Series 4 launched this time last year but with a new screen that can remain on all the time. To enable the always-on display, which many other smartwatches have had for several generations, Apple said it is using the first LTPO display, which it claims allows the screen to refresh dynamically from as high as 60Hz to 1Hz, alongside a new display controller and ambient light sensor. Apple said the Series 5 still has 18-hour battery life with the screen continuously on. The watch again comes in 44mm and 42mm sizes, with options for 4G connected versions, and Apple\u2019s ECG heart monitor. There are also a series of new colours, straps and case options, including titanium and ceramic ones. The new watchOS 6, announced in June, will also enable more functionality independent of the iPhone. Apple is also continuing its health focus for the watch, which now includes menstrual cycle tracking as part of watchOS 6. It has also launched a research app, with three health research studies \u2013 hearing, women\u2019s health, and heart and movement. The app will allow anyone to enrol and will roll out in the US later this year. Apple said it cannot access information that directly identifies you through the app. The Apple Watch has become a sleeper hit, capturing the lion\u2019s share of the small but increasingly important smartwatch market almost immediately on launch in 2015. Since then the line has increased sales year by year, providing an extra revenue stream alongside the firm\u2019s AirPods wireless earbuds, as people continue to hold on to their smartphones for longer and longer. Apple sold 43m Apple Watches over the last two years, according to data from IDC, accounting for nearly 50% of the global smartwatch market. The new Apple Watch Series 5 will start at \u00a3399 in the UK or $399 in the US, with 4G models costing from \u00a3499 or $499, shipping on 20 September. Apple is also keeping the older Series 3 available and dropping its price to \u00a3199 in the UK, $199 in the US.",

Dom Sibley\u2019s 51 took him to 1,000 Championship runs in the season, then Sam Hain (77 not out) and Matt Lamb (69 not out) added 129 more. The Championship\u2019s leading wicket-taker, Simon Harmer, wheeled out 36 overs, finishing with three for 67.</p> <p>At Taunton, <strong>Somerset</strong> failed to gather a batting point after being bowled out for 199; only 66 from captain Tom Abell and a fiery 40 from Jamie Overton, who was presented with his county cap in the lunch interval, preserved their hopes. Keshav Maharaj, playing his last match for <strong>Yorkshire</strong>, licked his lips and tweaked five for 54 against his favourite side. Yorkshire lost three wickets before the close.</p> <p>Darren Stevens\u2019 bashed 88 as he enters the end days of his <strong>Kent</strong> career nudged the innings into respectability. Ravi Ashwin, on return from waiter duty with India, took four for 121. <strong>Nottinghamshire\u2019s</strong> batsmen then suffered their now familiar wobble, losing two wickets before stumps. Stevens, inevitably, swiped one of them.</p> <p>Seventeen wickets fell on a green Southampton pitch after the Clark(e)s Jordan and Rikki kiboshed <strong>Hampshire</strong> for 149. Rikki Clarke\u2019s five for 21 included his 500th first-class wicket. <strong>Surrey\u2019s</strong> batting then folded in similar fashion, with Ollie Pope, overlooked for The Oval Test, top scoring with 68.</p> <p><strong>Middlesex\u2019s</strong> outside chance of promotion seemed to fade into the bad light at Lord\u2019s. After dismissing <strong>Durham</strong> for 147, pinned together by 54 from Australian Peter Handscomb \u2013 Steven Finn four for 41 \u2013 Middlesex had a collective afternoon swoon against Chris Rushworth and Ben Raine boldering in from the Nursery end, where the semi-demolished Compton and Edrich watched silently on.</p> <p><strong>Gloucestershire\u2019s</strong> promotion hopes stumbled after they were bowled out for 200 by <strong>Sussex</strong>, with three wickets for Chris Jordan in his first match back after injury. Phil Salt and Luke Wells then put on 73 without loss.</p> <p>At Old Trafford, Billy Godleman scored the first century for <strong>Derbyshire</strong> against <strong>Lancashire</strong> since Kim Barnett was about in his navy cap. Richard Gleeson earned five for 64.</p> <p>Hassan Azad yet again provided the foundation stone of <strong>Leicestershire\u2019s</strong> innings with 86 at Grace Road; while Riki Wessels was the sticking plaster to <strong>Worcestershire\u2019s</strong> fragile batting.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T18:30:44.208Z\">at 7.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d77e7b98f082514879f1a22\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T18:19:38.447Z\">7.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A bowler\u2019s day: </strong>I think, if my early evening addition hasn\u2019t let me down, that 103 wickets fell in the Championship in eight hours.

(But it was useful to be under there when it rained ...)</em></p> <p><em>Not mourned.</em></p> <p><em>Watched my first ever England match at lords from the back row of the lower Compton. The fact that they had to have a little digital screen under there telling you the score because you couldn\u2019t see the scoreboards tell you everything. Still going to miss it though.</em></p> <p><em>Also remember sitting there and turning round and seeing my dad talking to Barry Norman about how crap Mitchell Johnson has been bowling whilst waiting to be let back to his seat.</em><br></p> <p><em>Remember Kapil Dev in 1990, launching Eddie in to the building site in the \u20184 x 6 to save the follow on\u2019? I think the builders were penalised \u00a38k a day for late delivery of the C&amp;E stands.</em></p> <p><em>Sat on top tier of the Edrich stand to witness the best ever bowling display in a Lords final when 6-18 from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chappie03\">@chappie03</a> helped <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lancscricket\">@lancscricket</a> bowl out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EssexCricket\">@EssexCricket</a> for 57.</em></p> <p><em>Freezing cold and gloomy at the best of times.</em></p> <p><em>As I said earlier, I remember the stands before the Edrich and Compton were built. They didn\u2019t have a name as such, just \u2018Nursery End\u2019 or \u2018free seats\u2019 as we called them because you could sit there, or on the grass just behind the rope, for your \u2018ground admission\u2019.</em><br></p> <p><em>The seating was extremely uncomfortable, just slatted wooden benches, but you could rent a plastic cushion, with a little handle with which to carry it, for a shilling or 6d or whatever. They used to have them stacked up by the scorecards under Old Father Time, just outside the print shop. They turned \u2018extremely uncomfortable\u2019 into \u2018very uncomfortable\u2019, so I always sat on the grass.</em></p> <p><em>I don\u2019t know how many times I sat in the Edrich and Compton stands, not that many probably, but I do know the two best times I did, one in each. Both occasions will stay with me until I die.</em></p> <p><em>I was in the upper Edrich when I saw Afghanistan play MCC. Sam Hain, Brendon McCullum, Shiv, Dial T for Test Cricketer and Samit were in the MCC side, and although it was a damp and eventually wet day I had the time of my life. I was in among the Afghan supporters (there weren\u2019t any MCC supporters at all as far as I could tell) and they were truly wonderful. Rashid came to field on the boundary right below us (and later had Samit caught at deep midwicket), Shapoor bowled really well, Noor Ali was playing, Asghar was at mid on. I also got up close to Yasir Shah, who was so generous with everyone behind the pavilion during one of the interruptions. He\u2019d come down specially to speak to everyone. An unforgettable day.</em></p> <p><em>My fondest memory is of when it was raining and people were filing out for shelter, I stood at the top of the stairs with a big umbrella I\u2019d brought, and people sheltered under it briefly before going down, and then one Afghan boy, about ten years old, playfully poked a finger into my paunch. Made my day. Afghan Atalan!</em></p> <p><em>My other day to remember was two months later, when I met, in the upper Compton, AiX, Mrs AiX, Galactus, Chopper, Thamesider, Wegie, Busfield, Horizontal, Culinary, DirkGently and a couple of other people whose names I can\u2019t remember, to watch Middlesex against Lancashire. Probably a once in a lifetime chance for me. I even got to see Will McPherson from a few yards away and eat Welsh cakes.</em></p> <p><em>The stands may be torn down but memories remain treasured in my special place.</em></p> <p><em>That\u2019s lovely stuff. Most of the international cricket I\u2019ve watched since I moved to London in the 80s I\u2019ve seen from that end of the ground. There was the MCC v Rest of World test (just looked that up . 1987 - ye gods...), which I think was just the plain Nursery End, but I vividly remember Malcolm Marshall bowling Gavaskar with a beauty at the beginning of the fourth innings, with lightning flashing around overhead . Match pefectly poised, then the fifth day was a washout.</em></p> <p><em>Then Eng v West Indies 1991, with Robin Smith making a century. I remember his slow start, then gradually he got that cut shot working, and most of them seemed to come towards our corner of the ground. Happy memories indeed.</em></p> <p><em>Sad about the demise of the Compton and Edrich stands. The view from the front of the top tiers is one of my favourites. Always liked to sit there getting a bit crispy in the sunshine.</em></p> <p><em>I sat in the back row of the Compton lower for the first day of the Lord\u2019s test this year. Initially I had a bit of a grumble but in fact by the end, it turned out to be a fantastically sociable place to sit - chatting with all the passers-by who stopped to peer over the railing at the goings on in the middle.</em></p> <p><em>But in my mind, it will forever be linked with Eddie Hemmings, John Lever and the NatWest final. 30 years ago this year, it turns out - I was 18 years old and watching it in a pub in the Isle of Wight.</em></p> <p><em>I remember being in the C &amp; E in 1992 for the infamous ODI against Pakistan. Memories include the little scoreboard thingy that seemed like the cutting edge of technology, not seeing anything when the ball went in the air (I also missed Atherton hitting Ian Bishop for a six in 1995 for the same reason) and it being made clear to a large Pakistani gentleman that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 was not the sort of thing that was shouted at Lords.</em></p> <p><em>I will miss the Edrich upper. However they haven\u2019t put a foot wrong in my living memory with their redevelopments, so no doubt the new stands will be excellent in due course. Might give Lord\u2019s a miss next summer and pop along in 2021 for a look.</em></p> <p><em>What makes me feel really old is that I remember the Edrich and Compton being built. Watching Larry Gomes from those old wooden benches in the 1970s.....and Edmonds and Emburey in the days when most counties played 2 spinners.</em></p> <p>With many thanks to all BTL and on twitter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d77a3098f082514879f168b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T13:22:33.343Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Cosgrove </strong>out for 65 after a 122-run stand with Hassan Azad -<strong> Leicestershire 156-3</strong>.

Tom Alsop returns for Hampshire for the first time since his hamstring injury. </p> <p><strong>Nottinghamshire v Kent</strong>: Where is there for Notts to go? Perhaps their inspired win over Middlesex to take them to T20 finals day will prove a catalyst for change. Hmmm. Ravi Ashwin returns.

Stiaan van Zyl, George Garton and Chris Jordan return for Sussex after injury, as does Delray Rawlins, who missed their win over Middlesex because of international commitments. </p> <p><strong>Lancashire v Derbyshire</strong>: Lancashire need just 24 points to win promotion and dismiss the ghost of their nightmare T20 game against Essex . Glenn Maxwell plays his final game before returning to Victoria to prepare for the start of the Australian domestic season. Derbyshire include 18-year-old off-spinner Hamidullah Qadri in their squad.</p> <p><strong>Leicestershire v Northamptonshire:</strong> Northants have signed New Zealand all-rounder Doug Bracewell for the final three games of the season. Gareth Berg, who has joined from Hampshire, is also in their squad. George Rhodes could make his Leicestershire debut after joining from Worcestershire.</p> <p><strong>Middlesex v Durham</strong>: West Indies\u2019 fast bowler Miguel Cummins, who has signed for their three remaining Championship games, makes his debut for Middlesex. Durham, unbeaten in seven games, give a Championship debut to Scott Steel.</p> <p><strong>Worcestershire v Glamorgan:</strong> Worcestershire include Moeen Ali after his wonderful T20 century last week.

      "bodyText": "One hundred and three wickets fell on the first September day of this year\u2019s Championship, and yet neither the Division One leaders nor their chasing tail had a good day. Essex spent eight hours in the field at Edgbaston, where injury-plagued Warwickshire batted with great gumption. Dom Sibley\u2019s 51 took him to 1,000 Championship runs in the season, then Sam Hain (77 not out) and Matt Lamb (69 not out) added 129 more. The Championship\u2019s leading wicket-taker, Simon Harmer, wheeled out 36 overs, finishing with three for 67. At Taunton, Somerset failed to gather a batting point after being bowled out for 199; only 66 from captain Tom Abell and a fiery 40 from Jamie Overton, who was presented with his county cap in the lunch interval, preserved their hopes. Keshav Maharaj, playing his last match for Yorkshire, licked his lips and tweaked five for 54 against his favourite side. Yorkshire lost three wickets before the close. Darren Stevens\u2019 bashed 88 as he enters the end days of his Kent career nudged the innings into respectability. Ravi Ashwin, on return from waiter duty with India, took four for 121. Nottinghamshire\u2019s batsmen then suffered their now familiar wobble, losing two wickets before stumps. Stevens, inevitably, swiped one of them. Seventeen wickets fell on a green Southampton pitch after the Clark(e)s Jordan and Rikki kiboshed Hampshire for 149. Rikki Clarke\u2019s five for 21 included his 500th first-class wicket. Surrey\u2019s batting then folded in similar fashion, with Ollie Pope, overlooked for The Oval Test, top scoring with 68. Middlesex\u2019s outside chance of promotion seemed to fade into the bad light at Lord\u2019s. After dismissing Durham for 147, pinned together by 54 from Australian Peter Handscomb \u2013 Steven Finn four for 41 \u2013 Middlesex had a collective afternoon swoon against Chris Rushworth and Ben Raine boldering in from the Nursery end, where the semi-demolished Compton and Edrich watched silently on. Gloucestershire\u2019s promotion hopes stumbled after they were bowled out for 200 by Sussex, with three wickets for Chris Jordan in his first match back after injury. Phil Salt and Luke Wells then put on 73 without loss. At Old Trafford, Billy Godleman scored the first century for Derbyshire against Lancashire since Kim Barnett was about in his navy cap. Richard Gleeson earned five for 64. Hassan Azad yet again provided the foundation stone of Leicestershire\u2019s innings with 86 at Grace Road; while Riki Wessels was the sticking plaster to Worcestershire\u2019s fragile batting. A bowler\u2019s day: I think, if my early evening addition hasn\u2019t let me down, that 103 wickets fell in the Championship in eight hours. So think about that as you tuck into your vegetarian tortellini. An evening hurrah then to an allrounder - Darren Stevens, whose salad days never end - and four batsmen who stood tall- Hassan Azad, Tom Abell, Ollie Pope and the only centurion of the day - Billy Godleman. Thanks for all your messages and chatter BTL - see you tomorrow! I had better concentrate on my round-up now, as Middlesex\u2019s last hope, Dawid Malan, departs, for 24. I think 92 wickets have fallen today so far in the Championship... can we make the round 100 by the close? Notts trying to prove a point: 5 for 1. Libby lbw Stevens 1. Which batting lineup has had the worst season - Middlesex or Worcestershire or Notts? Or have I missed someone? And another at Lord\u2019s...77-6... Simpson lbw Raine for a three-ball duck. Deal with a bit of admin, watch a bit, and then remember I haven\u2019t checked the score at Taunton. Yorkshire have lost 2 for 0 on 27. Ballance and Kohler-Cadmore doing the running repairs - 40-2. Just looking on the Somerset website to see if I could find out if the pitch was already turning square - no real hints there. But I did discover that Jamie Overton was presented with his Somerset county cap during the lunch interval. And Middlesex lose another, Scott to Ben Raine, 77-5. As I write this Chris Rushworth is the leading British first-class wicket-taker in the country with 59! Behind only Simon Harmer. Holden whips Rushworth off his legs - and straight to square leg! Oh wondrous carthorse! Middlesex 59-4. Ask not for whom the bell tolls So.... Yorkshire have 21 overs to face today, and they\u2019ve survived two of them - 12/0. And Rushworth has his first scalp - Robson pushing forward into the gloom and caught at slip. Middx 51-3. Dawid Malan giving Middlesex supporters the heebie-jeebies as he gets off the mark with a ..flamboyant... four. Middlesex 47-2. Somerset 199 all out - is that a crucial bonus point missed? Five wickets for Maharaj. Sussex continuing to chip away at Gloucestershire - 165-6; Richard Gleeson\u2019s 4-55 precipitating a middle-order collapse of four for 16, but Billy Godleman and an obstinate tail have inched Derby to 202-6. Azad leading the way yet again at Grace Road, 86 not out, Leicestershire 210-5; and Worcestershire\u2019s bits and bobs innings has patchworked together a curate\u2019s egg of a total - 194-8. Chris Rushworth has moved to the dereliction end... Sam Hain (41 not out) picking up where Will Rhodes (38) and Dom Sibley (51) left off. Warwickshire 174 for 3. And Billy Godleman has scored the first century for Derbyshire against Lancashire since Kim Barnett! The hugest of slices of cake for Tom Abell - 60 off 166 balls - and the increasingly reliable Jamie Overton (22) Somerset 175-8, better but not enough. To be noted, Maharaj now has 3-46. Good old Darren Stevens ...43 not out to take Kent to 211-6 and slow the Notts advance. Eskinazi now bent double after being hit by Rushworth... on come the physios... A run! In other news... Hampshire 149 all out (Clarke 5-21), Surrey 15-2..... Great to see Rushworth in the flesh, charging in from the pavilion end, larger than life.... but hang on.... the first wicket falls in the second over. Gubbins lbw Carse for a miserable, head down, duck. Middlesex 0-1. Just preparing for Chris Rushworth... And as the Lord\u2019s floodlights come on - Durham go off. All out 147 before tea. A quietly magnificent 54 from Peter Handscomb, but not much else to speak of. Lovely to see Steven Finn leading the players off with 4-41 to loud applause and cheer or two. Tim Murtagh 3-32. The CCLive memories Sitting in the lower tier of those was always like watching an old film on TV - just a narrow strip visible! (But it was useful to be under there when it rained ...) Not mourned. Watched my first ever England match at lords from the back row of the lower Compton. The fact that they had to have a little digital screen under there telling you the score because you couldn\u2019t see the scoreboards tell you everything. Still going to miss it though. Also remember sitting there and turning round and seeing my dad talking to Barry Norman about how crap Mitchell Johnson has been bowling whilst waiting to be let back to his seat. Remember Kapil Dev in 1990, launching Eddie in to the building site in the \u20184 x 6 to save the follow on\u2019? I think the builders were penalised \u00a38k a day for late delivery of the C&amp;E stands. Sat on top tier of the Edrich stand to witness the best ever bowling display in a Lords final when 6-18 from @chappie03 helped @lancscricket bowl out @EssexCricket for 57. Freezing cold and gloomy at the best of times. As I said earlier, I remember the stands before the Edrich and Compton were built. They didn\u2019t have a name as such, just \u2018Nursery End\u2019 or \u2018free seats\u2019 as we called them because you could sit there, or on the grass just behind the rope, for your \u2018ground admission\u2019. The seating was extremely uncomfortable, just slatted wooden benches, but you could rent a plastic cushion, with a little handle with which to carry it, for a shilling or 6d or whatever. They used to have them stacked up by the scorecards under Old Father Time, just outside the print shop. They turned \u2018extremely uncomfortable\u2019 into \u2018very uncomfortable\u2019, so I always sat on the grass. I don\u2019t know how many times I sat in the Edrich and Compton stands, not that many probably, but I do know the two best times I did, one in each. Both occasions will stay with me until I die. I was in the upper Edrich when I saw Afghanistan play MCC. Sam Hain, Brendon McCullum, Shiv, Dial T for Test Cricketer and Samit were in the MCC side, and although it was a damp and eventually wet day I had the time of my life. I was in among the Afghan supporters (there weren\u2019t any MCC supporters at all as far as I could tell) and they were truly wonderful. Rashid came to field on the boundary right below us (and later had Samit caught at deep midwicket), Shapoor bowled really well, Noor Ali was playing, Asghar was at mid on. I also got up close to Yasir Shah, who was so generous with everyone behind the pavilion during one of the interruptions. He\u2019d come down specially to speak to everyone. An unforgettable day. My fondest memory is of when it was raining and people were filing out for shelter, I stood at the top of the stairs with a big umbrella I\u2019d brought, and people sheltered under it briefly before going down, and then one Afghan boy, about ten years old, playfully poked a finger into my paunch. Made my day. Afghan Atalan! My other day to remember was two months later, when I met, in the upper Compton, AiX, Mrs AiX, Galactus, Chopper, Thamesider, Wegie, Busfield, Horizontal, Culinary, DirkGently and a couple of other people whose names I can\u2019t remember, to watch Middlesex against Lancashire. Probably a once in a lifetime chance for me. I even got to see Will McPherson from a few yards away and eat Welsh cakes. The stands may be torn down but memories remain treasured in my special place. That\u2019s lovely stuff. Most of the international cricket I\u2019ve watched since I moved to London in the 80s I\u2019ve seen from that end of the ground. There was the MCC v Rest of World test (just looked that up . 1987 - ye gods...), which I think was just the plain Nursery End, but I vividly remember Malcolm Marshall bowling Gavaskar with a beauty at the beginning of the fourth innings, with lightning flashing around overhead . Match pefectly poised, then the fifth day was a washout. Then Eng v West Indies 1991, with Robin Smith making a century. I remember his slow start, then gradually he got that cut shot working, and most of them seemed to come towards our corner of the ground. Happy memories indeed. Sad about the demise of the Compton and Edrich stands. The view from the front of the top tiers is one of my favourites. Always liked to sit there getting a bit crispy in the sunshine. I sat in the back row of the Compton lower for the first day of the Lord\u2019s test this year. Initially I had a bit of a grumble but in fact by the end, it turned out to be a fantastically sociable place to sit - chatting with all the passers-by who stopped to peer over the railing at the goings on in the middle. But in my mind, it will forever be linked with Eddie Hemmings, John Lever and the NatWest final. 30 years ago this year, it turns out - I was 18 years old and watching it in a pub in the Isle of Wight. I remember being in the C &amp; E in 1992 for the infamous ODI against Pakistan. Memories include the little scoreboard thingy that seemed like the cutting edge of technology, not seeing anything when the ball went in the air (I also missed Atherton hitting Ian Bishop for a six in 1995 for the same reason) and it being made clear to a large Pakistani gentleman that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 was not the sort of thing that was shouted at Lords. I will miss the Edrich upper. However they haven\u2019t put a foot wrong in my living memory with their redevelopments, so no doubt the new stands will be excellent in due course. Might give Lord\u2019s a miss next summer and pop along in 2021 for a look. What makes me feel really old is that I remember the Edrich and Compton being built. Watching Larry Gomes from those old wooden benches in the 1970s.....and Edmonds and Emburey in the days when most counties played 2 spinners. With many thanks to all BTL and on twitter. Mark Cosgrove out for 65 after a 122-run stand with Hassan Azad - Leicestershire 156-3. And Worcestershire assume the customary position, 124-5 as Riki Wessels shakes his head and gets stuck in, again (25 not out). A couple of wickets for Chris Jordan against Gloucestershire - now 107 for five. Ah, that\u2019s more like it Lancashire - Derby 137 for five. Billy Godleman plugging away, 68 not out. And a sensational catch at third slip at high speed by Robson here at Lord\u2019s as Durham slip to 126 for 7. Clouds gathering. But there\u2019s always Chris Rushworth... Ashwin 4-35 now....Kent 120 for five and looking to Darren Stevens for one last breaking of the bread. Hampshire 106-8 - Clarke 5-21. FGS Somerset - 100 for 6. Tom Abell and Dom Bess left to stitch something back together. Anyone at Taunton? A September Ciderabad awaiting Yorkshire\u2019s batsmen? Dom Sibley 50 not out - surely deserving of an opener\u2019s winter tour spot? Warwicks 129 for 2. Ravi Ashwin doing his best to do the impossible for Notts - 3 for 29 including Daniel Bell-Drummond for 45. Kent 114 for 4. Hampshire starting the afternoon where they left off this morning, 84 for seven, another for Rikki Clarke (4-18) and 21 year old Conor McKerr throwing his hat in the ring. It seems a bit mean to spoil these dog(ish)-days of the Championship but y0u might like to read this... A lovely post-prandial stroll round the ground at lunch. A perhaps surprising number of people want to spend a September Tuesday at Lord\u2019s watching county cricket, which is lovely to see. The Coronation Gardens full of people novel reading, coffee drinking, phone-scrolling and a forlorn-looking elderly chap carrying a string bag full of onions. And here is the Spin wot I wrote. Inevitably there is a lot more in the excellent HIT FOR SIX report than I was able to cover in 900 words - I\u2019d urge you to have a look at it yourselves - I\u2019ll try to find a link. Division One Hampshire 60-5 (Clarke 3-6, Clark 2-25) v Surrey Kent 78-3 (R Ashwin 2-11) v Nottinghamshire Somerset 70-4 (Olivier 2-22) v Yorkshire Warwickshire 91-2 v Essex Division Two Gloucestershire 86-2 v Sussex Derbyshire 107-2 v Lancashire Leicestershire 91-2 v Northamptonshire Durham 80-4 v Middlesex Worcestershire 74-2 v Glamorgan Some excellent lunchtime reading. And Durham lose a wicket on the stroke of lunch - 80 for four. Tim Murtagh doing the damage. And a lunchtime county cap for Tom Helm! Lunch scores to follow. Have Hampshire got end-of-term-itus or are the Clark(s) unstoppable? A second for Jordan, Hampshire 60 for 5, with last wicket James Vince top scorer with 15. Here\u2019s some vintage Old Man River. In Division Two, James Bracey is carrying Gloucestershire\u2019s promotion hopes, 46 not out, Gloucs 68-2 against Sussex. Lancashire making heavy weather of Derbyshire, who are 81/1 - Billy Godleman 43 not out. Hasan Azad - in contention for batsman of the season - and Cosgrove have taken Leicestershire to 78 for 2, Durham are anchoring down to prevent pre-lunch demolition - 75 for 3. Worcestershire are 71 for 2 with Mo flowering three fours before falling for 18. All of a sudden, those wickets, they\u2019re a tumbling. Cummings returns from the pavilion end and Robson fends rather hopelessly and is caught at slip for the fattest of ducks. Durham 59-3. Hampshire have had a shocker - 26 for four!!!! The Clark(e)s have snaffled them all - three for Rikki and one for Jordan. Yorkshire steaming in at Taunton alas, Somerset 46-3, two for Olivier. Kent 62-1 and, as an exception, Rhodes and Sibley on the charge against Essex, Warwickshire 72-0. A little nugget I\u2019ve just discovered from the Middlesex experts in the box - Tom Helm is very highly regarded by England and Geoff Arnold is often down at Lord\u2019s having a look at him. Er, another wicket at Lord\u2019s with no addition to the score. Steel bowled Finn for 29, a little inside edge onto the off stump. Blame the clouds Durham. A wicket! as the clouds draw over Lord\u2019s. Lees lbw Harris for 26 and a nice solid first-wicket stand of 56 by Durham. Middlesex feel they have an outside chance of promotion if they can grab a couple of wins against Durham and Derbyshire and hold on for a (weather-affected) draw at Old Trafford. Right - a quick look round the grounds. Just five wickets have fallen in the first hour - which makes it one of our tamer CC mornings. In Division one, Kent are 40-1, Zak Crawley lbw to Luke Fletcher for 3. Steve Davies fell for 13 at Taunton, Somerset 25-1. In Division two, Leicestershire have lost a couple of early wickets - Horton and Ackermann - 32 for 2 against Northants. And Worcestershire are 39-1, which means Moeen is batting! I\u2019ve also spotted a Telegraph story that David Gower has sensed an \u201celement of implied ageism\u201d in Sky\u2019s decision not to renew his contract. Tricky, as there has to be an element of change and freshening up in any industry, especially TV. And Sky could do with more diversity. Though I\u2019ve always rather enjoyed his lackadaisical style. He was good as a stand in on radio 4 the other day too. A lovely memory from Cath Hanley on Twitter. Sitting in the lower tier of those was always like watching an old film on TV - just a narrow strip visible! (But it was useful to be under there when it rained ...) Do send me your memories of soggy sandwiches in Compton and Edrich. Not much happening here at Lord\u2019s at the moment, Durham 26 for 0 - Tim Murtagh has had Steel and Lees playing and missing a bit and Cummins looks like he\u2019d rather be tucked up with a cardigan and a log fire. Some Hundred news straight from the ECB newsroom - a couple of big name signings for the Trent Rockets, another overseas coach for the men, another British coach for the women. There\u2019s a story there somewhere, though I\u2019m not sure what. Perhaps it celebrates the strength of female coaches in this country. \u201cSalliann Briggs and Stephen Fleming have been appointed as head coaches for the Nottingham-based team in The Hundred. Former New Zealand captain Fleming is the most successful coach in the history of the Indian Premier League, winning three titles with the Chennai Super Kings. He returns to Trent Bridge where he skippered Nottinghamshire to the 2005 County Championship title. Grimsby-born Briggs was coach of Loughborough Lightning from 2016 to 2018 and led her team to Kia Super League Finals Day for the first time in 2016. She is currently coach of the Hobart Hurricanes in the Women\u2019s Big Bash League in Australia.\u201d We\u2019ve got a slightly skewiff view of the ground today, diagonally on from the wicket in a box on the first floor of the Tavern stand. The media centre is out of bounds, propped up with a scaffolding,, there\u2019s a fair scattering of bods in the pavillion , which looks a lot more normal in shirts and slacks than it does on Test match days. I\u2019ll try and get round the back of the stands for a true demolition shot after lunch but here is the view from the boundary. So three important rounds to come - with nearly everything still up in the air - Lancashire can clinch the Division Two Championship this round - but the chasing pack have all to play for. Essex, Somerset and, at a push, Yorkshire will be going full pelt for the pennant. Division One Hampshire v Surrey: Dean Elgar, Jamie Smith and Jade Dernbach are included in Surrey\u2019s squad. Tom Alsop returns for Hampshire for the first time since his hamstring injury. Nottinghamshire v Kent: Where is there for Notts to go? Perhaps their inspired win over Middlesex to take them to T20 finals day will prove a catalyst for change. Hmmm. Ravi Ashwin returns. Kent need only four points to secure their division one place for next season. Somerset v Yorkshire: Somerset have signed India\u2019s Murali Vijay for the last three games of the season while Lewis Gregory returns to the squad. Keshav Maharaj makes his final Championship appearance for Yorkshire. Warwickshire v Essex: Top of the table Essex, unbeaten in 10 Championship matches, haven\u2019t signed an overseas player for the title run in. Division Two Gloucestershire v Sussex: Shannon Gabriel makes his debut for Gloucestershire, as they look to secure what would be a surprise promotion to Division Two. Stiaan van Zyl, George Garton and Chris Jordan return for Sussex after injury, as does Delray Rawlins, who missed their win over Middlesex because of international commitments. Lancashire v Derbyshire: Lancashire need just 24 points to win promotion and dismiss the ghost of their nightmare T20 game against Essex . Glenn Maxwell plays his final game before returning to Victoria to prepare for the start of the Australian domestic season. Derbyshire include 18-year-old off-spinner Hamidullah Qadri in their squad. Leicestershire v Northamptonshire: Northants have signed New Zealand all-rounder Doug Bracewell for the final three games of the season. Gareth Berg, who has joined from Hampshire, is also in their squad. George Rhodes could make his Leicestershire debut after joining from Worcestershire. Middlesex v Durham: West Indies\u2019 fast bowler Miguel Cummins, who has signed for their three remaining Championship games, makes his debut for Middlesex. Durham, unbeaten in seven games, give a Championship debut to Scott Steel. Worcestershire v Glamorgan: Worcestershire include Moeen Ali after his wonderful T20 century last week. Timm van der Gugten returns after recovering from a back injury. Good morning from Lord\u2019s, where the sun is out and the cricket is going to take place to the sound of demolition - the bottom of the Edrich stand is a pile of rubble and the Compton forlornly watches its last round of cricket - Middlesex v Durham - naked in its concreteness. As the nights draw in the remaining three rounds of the Championship will start at 10.30am. Round-up to follow very shortly - slightly delayed by a very slow installation of chrome on my computer. It\u2019s lovely to be back!",

      "body": "<p>One way not to recognise a potentially heavy investment loss is to close your eyes, ignore the evidence and pretend nothing has happened. This seems to be Masayoshi Son\u2019s approach at WeWork.</p> <p>The SoftBank tech investor wants WeWork to abandon its flotation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/111f8e00-d346-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77\">reports the FT</a> (\u00a3), for reasons that are not hard to guess. A listing in New York would expose the horrible truth about the allegedly hip workspace landlord. It ain\u2019t worth $47bn, the value at which SoftBank injected the last portion of its $10.5bn investment. Try $15bn-$20bn, suggests Wall Street.</p> <p>Even the lower range looks rich. The problem with WeWork runs deeper than the teeth-grinding corporate mission statement (\u201cA place you join as an individual, \u2018me\u2019, but where you become part of a greater \u2018we\u2019\u201d). First, there\u2019s the losses \u2013 $1.9bn last year \u2013 with more expected into the middle distance.</p> <p>Second, there\u2019s the unflattering financial comparison with London-listed property group IWG, which has been in the same marketplace for years and makes real profits, but is worth a more sensible \u00a33.6bn.</p> <p>Third, there\u2019s an obvious risk in taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents. In a recession, tenants may decide to trade down and forgo WeWork\u2019s funky murals and cheese-tasting events, but the landlord\u2019s lease costs would remain fixed.</p> <p>Fourth, and perhaps most seriously, there\u2019s WeWork\u2019s breezy style of corporate governance. Co-founder Adam Neumann wasn\u2019t obviously living up to the spirit of collective endeavour when his investment vehicle was paid $5.9m by the company for the right to use the trademarked word \u201cwe\u201d. The sum has been repaid but how was the arrangement ever approved?</p> <p>Fans may counter that the sleepy world of shared office spaces was overdue a dose of innovation and global branding. Maybe, but WeWork remains a bricks and mortar company. It is not Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer where Son made a fortune.</p> <p>The flotation conundrum sets up serious tension. WeWork needs to raise $3bn-plus to keep expanding and unlock further investment. SoftBank, on the other hand, won\u2019t want to record a formal loss on its punt while it\u2019s looking to raise $100bn for its next Vision fund. It will still be in money on the early portions of its investment but any valuation for WeWork below $25bn looks likely to imply an overall loss. Even SoftBank\u2019s normally reliable Saudi backers would be unimpressed.</p> <p>The rest of us, though, can cheer Wall Street\u2019s refusal to play ball. It suggests rational analysis is returning to a stock market where, for a while, it seemed any over-hyped mega-venture with famous private equity-style backers could name its price. WeWork <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/oct/10/softbank-punt-on-wework-office-space-hub-is-risky-business\">always looked like a bubble</a>. Deflation had to happen.</p> <h2>The CBI needs to calm down on Corbyn</h2> <p>Advice for the CBI: damning all Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic proposals with equal fury doesn\u2019t work. Sometimes the Labour leader will produce ideas that big business might live with happily, or even come to applaud.</p> <p>A ministry for employment rights and a workers\u2019 protection agency \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/jeremy-corbyn-extension-workers-rights-labour-tuc-congress\">the central pitch in Corbyn\u2019s address to the TUC Congress in Brighton on Tuesday</a> \u2013 should not frighten any responsible employer. Enforcing employment laws vigorously might even benefit companies who would not think of breaching rules in the first place. Free-riders would find life harder and competition might be made marginally fairer.</p> <p>It is not a revolutionary idea \u2013 and certainly not a case of \u201cturning back the clock decades\u201d, in the CBI\u2019s excitable catch-all language. Sports Direct was obliged to reform working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">this paper\u2019s investigations in 2015</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\">a Commons select committee\u2019s report</a>. The affair struck a chord because workers \u2013 and, most fair-minded bosses \u2013 can recognise grubby behaviour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some other Labour business proposals, it is true, do not stand up to scrutiny or would not even achieve their aims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/sep/24/john-mcdonnell-is-not-offering-workers-real-share-ownership\">as argued here in the past</a>. The \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d, via which 10% ownership of every large company would be transferred over a decade to a workers\u2019 pot, should be binned.</p> <p>The biggest beneficiary, by far, every year would be the Treasury since dividends for employees would be capped at \u00a3500-a-head. There is nothing inclusive about second-class share ownership, especially when workers\u2019 existing pension schemes would suffer from the share dilution. If Labour wants to boost employee share ownership, cleverer approaches are available.</p> <p>But not every Labour idea is as radical as the CBI seems instinctively to believe. Ensuring that employment rights are respected should not be controversial. It would do the CBI no harm to say so.</p>",

It ain\u2019t worth $47bn, the value at which SoftBank injected the last portion of its $10.5bn investment. Try $15bn-$20bn, suggests Wall Street. Even the lower range looks rich. The problem with WeWork runs deeper than the teeth-grinding corporate mission statement (\u201cA place you join as an individual, \u2018me\u2019, but where you become part of a greater \u2018we\u2019\u201d). First, there\u2019s the losses \u2013 $1.9bn last year \u2013 with more expected into the middle distance. Second, there\u2019s the unflattering financial comparison with London-listed property group IWG, which has been in the same marketplace for years and makes real profits, but is worth a more sensible \u00a33.6bn. Third, there\u2019s an obvious risk in taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents. In a recession, tenants may decide to trade down and forgo WeWork\u2019s funky murals and cheese-tasting events, but the landlord\u2019s lease costs would remain fixed. Fourth, and perhaps most seriously, there\u2019s WeWork\u2019s breezy style of corporate governance. Co-founder Adam Neumann wasn\u2019t obviously living up to the spirit of collective endeavour when his investment vehicle was paid $5.9m by the company for the right to use the trademarked word \u201cwe\u201d. The sum has been repaid but how was the arrangement ever approved? Fans may counter that the sleepy world of shared office spaces was overdue a dose of innovation and global branding. Maybe, but WeWork remains a bricks and mortar company. It is not Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer where Son made a fortune. The flotation conundrum sets up serious tension. WeWork needs to raise $3bn-plus to keep expanding and unlock further investment. SoftBank, on the other hand, won\u2019t want to record a formal loss on its punt while it\u2019s looking to raise $100bn for its next Vision fund. It will still be in money on the early portions of its investment but any valuation for WeWork below $25bn looks likely to imply an overall loss. Even SoftBank\u2019s normally reliable Saudi backers would be unimpressed. The rest of us, though, can cheer Wall Street\u2019s refusal to play ball. It suggests rational analysis is returning to a stock market where, for a while, it seemed any over-hyped mega-venture with famous private equity-style backers could name its price. WeWork always looked like a bubble. Deflation had to happen. The CBI needs to calm down on Corbyn Advice for the CBI: damning all Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic proposals with equal fury doesn\u2019t work. Sometimes the Labour leader will produce ideas that big business might live with happily, or even come to applaud. A ministry for employment rights and a workers\u2019 protection agency \u2013 the central pitch in Corbyn\u2019s address to the TUC Congress in Brighton on Tuesday \u2013 should not frighten any responsible employer. Enforcing employment laws vigorously might even benefit companies who would not think of breaching rules in the first place. Free-riders would find life harder and competition might be made marginally fairer. It is not a revolutionary idea \u2013 and certainly not a case of \u201cturning back the clock decades\u201d, in the CBI\u2019s excitable catch-all language. Sports Direct was obliged to reform working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse after this paper\u2019s investigations in 2015 and a Commons select committee\u2019s report. The affair struck a chord because workers \u2013 and, most fair-minded bosses \u2013 can recognise grubby behaviour. Some other Labour business proposals, it is true, do not stand up to scrutiny or would not even achieve their aims, as argued here in the past. The \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d, via which 10% ownership of every large company would be transferred over a decade to a workers\u2019 pot, should be binned. The biggest beneficiary, by far, every year would be the Treasury since dividends for employees would be capped at \u00a3500-a-head. There is nothing inclusive about second-class share ownership, especially when workers\u2019 existing pension schemes would suffer from the share dilution. If Labour wants to boost employee share ownership, cleverer approaches are available. But not every Labour idea is as radical as the CBI seems instinctively to believe. Ensuring that employment rights are respected should not be controversial. It would do the CBI no harm to say so.",

Let us not miss the opportunity to do so again. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (July 2019), average earnings, when adjusted for inflation, stand at \u00a3502 a week in total pay, \u00a323 lower than in February 2008 \u2013 not \u201c\u00a3525 a week in total pay, \u00a322 lower than in February 2008\u201d as an earlier version stated.",

      "bodyText": "Fires are raging across Queensland and New South Wales \u2013 80 across Queensland alone. As is the case with the Amazon fires, for many the strong urge is to hide from the news. It\u2019s not for lack of caring. It\u2019s because you don\u2019t even need to have survived fire seasons to remember how this awful story ends \u2013 just a childhood memory of Bambi or Smokey Bear. The forest paradise is destroyed, the world made more ugly in its ruin. The animals are left homeless, scarred or dead. Watching the news at a distance is to feel as powerless to intervene and save the innocent creatures as we did back then. We\u2019re just weeping children stuck in their chairs while on the other side of the cinema screen \u2013 or the world \u2013 that which is most precious is annihilated. Amid the growing global climate anxiety, there\u2019s an intimate, personal distress induced by these blazes. Other desperate omens \u2013 the disappearing glaciers in Iceland, the bioluminescent coastlines in India, melting lakes in the Alps \u2013 register as disturbing but more abstract terrors. One explanation of why forest catastrophes are uniquely terrifying perhaps also explains the powerful impact of the Bambi story, even on children who have never seen a living deer. In his book Children\u2019s Dreaming and the Development of Consciousness, psychologist David Foulkes suggests animals are recruited as avatars of the emerging self in children\u2019s dreams; they feature heavily within them. \u201cAnimals carry human concerns,\u201d Foulkes writes, \u201cand readily become objects of identification.\u201d So it\u2019s not just on a metaphoric or rational level that we know what\u2019s happening to the creatures terrorised, scorched and destroyed in the flames is also happening to us. We grasp it psychologically. No wonder the instinct is to run away, hoping for a hero, a cosmic deus ex machina or someone\u2019s clever mum to save us, especially given governments from Brazil to Australia and the US seem so uninterested. Thinking about child psychology, the way children problem-solve and a panic-inspired, imperative emotional need to rescue every Bambi, everywhere, provoked me to the sudden question: Mum, can we regrow all the burning forests in our backyards at home? Amid much intimation that the Amazon fires are a convenient event for a Brazilian government intent on land clearing, the vocal point was made that Australia also faces a land-clearing crisis. Irrespective of what damage is wreaked by fires, more than three million hectares of local woodland are facing destruction through deliberate means by 2030. This means that three-quarters of already threatened species are likely to lose what remains of their habitat. The UN reports that a third of greenhouse gases are attributable to land clearing for farming. But governments, like that of New South Wales \u2013 a state currently on fire \u2013 have responded by weakening land-clearing laws and gifting amnesties to illegal land clearers. The horrifying science is that deforestation itself drives more forests to burn. And this is why both habitat protection and active reforestation and revegetation has to be prioritised by governments \u2013 at all levels \u2013 in the pressing climate fight. The battlefront is not only to save the forests we have left, but to properly revegetate the spaces humanity has already taken over \u2013 for while wildlife areas perish, cities are also warming. Plant life sequests carbon, and retains habitat and biodiversity, but trees also make the most significant contribution to urban cooling \u2013 a necessity for liveability as the climate heats. In Australia there are some efforts to do this at a local government level, but in the absence of a prioritised national strategy, it\u2019s piecemeal. A recent study reported in the Conversation found 54 out of 139 of communities studied \u201csuffered statistically significant\u201d losses of green space within the preceding decade \u2013 because it\u2019s not only the Amazon that\u2019s disappearing. In the empty space of any policy framework, we\u2019re building over the Australian backyard \u2013 tragically, maddeningly. The backyards and other green spaces of our communities are the one place where individuals can, in fact, make some material contribution to fixing the collective problem. It\u2019s not the present Morrison government but Bob Hawke\u2019s legacy, Landcare, showing leadership in replanting a denuded Australia. The networked national organisation of community-based groups does mobilise volunteers to assist land rehabilitation. It does plant trees. In the areas where their pilot scheme, Gardens for Wildlife, is running, they will even come to your home and advise how to turn what land you have into a working contribution to carbon capture and habitat extension. The most dangerous thing about this pilot scheme is the hope it inspires. Imagine if it was part of a coordinated national strategy, funded on a level the climate crisis should oblige.

      "bodyText": "Department of the environment officials were acutely sensitive about meeting Angus Taylor over critically endangered grasslands while his family\u2019s company was being investigated for alleged illegal land clearing in New South Wales, according to internal emails. The information is revealed in correspondence that had previously been partially redacted from documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws in June this year. It comes after Labor again pursued the energy and emissions reduction minister in question time on Tuesday and called on him to resign over the saga. The correspondence shows a senior department official, Geoff Richardson, emailing colleagues on 15 March 2017, five days before he and other colleagues were to meet with Taylor and Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office about the government\u2019s designation of the critically endangered natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. \u201cI have a meeting with Monica Collins [the head of compliance] on Friday to understand the background to this becoming an issue, which I believe is compliance action/s initiated by NSW around land clearing conducted at one or more properties south of Cooma,\u201d he writes. \u201cI need to understand this to know what Matt and I need to steer very clear of in any discussion with Mr Taylor.\u201d The department also revealed in responses to questions from a Senate committee that the meeting took place in Taylor\u2019s office at Parliament House and that no notes were taken by officials present. At the time of the meeting with Taylor, state and federal investigations were under way into whether the company Jam Land Pty Ltd illegally cleared land containing the grasses in the Monaro region of New South Wales. Angus Taylor\u2019s brother, Richard, is one of the directors of Jam Land and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. In his email, Richardson writes to colleagues that he is seeking background ahead of the meeting as to why the grasslands listing had become an issue. He makes it clear that he believes the reason is the compliance action related to clearing. Monica Collins, the department\u2019s head of compliance, the unit responsible for investigating potential breaches of Australian environment law, was asked by Frydenberg\u2019s office to attend the meeting with Taylor but another staff member from the unit went in her place. The newly published information has come via questions on notice put by the Greens senator Janet Rice as part of the Senate inquiry into fauna extinctions. The department agreed to supply the previously redacted material to the committee because \u201cit relates to information that is now publicly known\u201d. Another email, sent on 22 April 2017 by the senior environment official Stephen Oxley about a month after the Taylor meeting, also reveals that there was only one incident of clearing of Monaro grasslands for agriculture being pursued \u2013 and that was the compliance case involving Jam Land. \u201cSince the ecological community was listed in 2000, the Department understands that this has happened only once for agriculture activities, and that is in relation to the current compliance investigation,\u201d he wrote. In the same email, he goes on to say: \u201cBoth NSW and Commonwealth are pursuing the current compliance case in question because the alleged destruction of high quality native grasslands has triggered both state and national law.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Taylor has repeatedly stated he sought the briefing because of the impact of the listing on farmers in his electorate of Hume. But Oxley\u2019s email states that the regulatory impact on farmers had been low and no one else was being pursued for clearing the grasslands. The newly supplied sections are from the same email in which the department gave Frydenberg\u2019s office advice on whether the grassland protections could be watered down and whether such a change would have to be made public. In responses to written questions from the Senate committee, the department reiterates that the compliance matter was not discussed at the 20 March 2017 meeting with Taylor \u201cor in subsequent conversations with the former Minister for the Environment and Energy, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP\u2019s staff\u201d. A hearing last month of the Senate\u2019s inquiry into fauna extinctions was told Taylor did not declare his business or personal interest in Jam Land at the time of the meeting with department officials in March 2017 and that one of the senior officials present did not take notes. Asic records show Taylor\u2019s interest in Jam Land was recorded in May 2017, after the departmental meeting. However the department told the committee it was aware of the family connection when the meeting took place.",

      "bodyText": "The former Liberal leader John Hewson has called on Scott Morrison to grant government MPs a conscience vote on a new parliamentary motion declaring a climate emergency. Hewson, who will join MPs on Wednesday to champion the new parliamentary motion which is being pursued by the Greens and is supported by most of the lower house crossbench, told Guardian Australia there was no controversy associated with declaring a climate emergency in 2019, \u201cbecause my view is it was an emergency 30 years ago\u201d. He said Liberal backbenchers were feeling pressure from their constituents about the Coalition\u2019s lack of ambition on climate change, so the prime minister should allow a free vote on the motion. Hewson argued if it had been acceptable for Tony Abbott to declare a budget emergency in the run-up to the 2013 election, Liberals in 2019 should have no issue with adopting the language in the Greens motion, because declaring a climate emergency in Australia \u201calmost goes without saying\u201d. He said Australia should have adopted ambitious climate policy in the 1990s, but given that failure \u201cwe\u2019ve left it very late in the day to get to net zero emissions by 2050\u201d. The British parliament declared a climate emergency in May, endorsing a parliamentary motion moved by the Labour party. Conservative MPs in the UK were told to not oppose the Labour motion. A number of Australian councils have already declared a climate emergency, including the Wagga Wagga city council in the electorate of the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Michael McCormack \u2013 although the Wagga motion was subsequently rescinded. The Australian Medical Association has formally declared climate change a health emergency, pointing to \u201cclear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future\u201d. The Senate late on Tuesday passed a Greens motion on the voices calling on the government to protect Australian farmers by \u201ctaking urgent action to address the climate emergency\u201d. The Senate motion addressed drought and the elevated summer fire risk. The proposed declaration motion for the lower house calls on the House of Representatives to declare an environment and climate emergency and to take urgent action consistent with internationally accepted science. It notes that extreme weather events will devastate large parts of Australia and radically impact food production, water availability, public health, infrastructure, the community and the financial system; and notes that the government has acknowledged urgent action is required to address climate change. The proposal is being advanced by the lower house Green MP, Adam Bandt, and would seconded by the independent member for Warringah, Zali Steggall. The motion is supported by independents Helen Haines and Andrew Wilkie and the Centre Alliance member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie. The Greens are yet to canvass Labor on whether they will support the motion. The former Labor leader, Bill Shorten, went close to declaring a climate emergency during the May election campaign, declaring in a speech during the final week: \u201cWe will take [the climate change] emergency seriously, and we will not just leave it to other countries or to the next generation\u201d. While senior Labor figures insist Labor will stay the course on climate change during this term, this week the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said Labor needs to review all of its election policies, including the ones he developed in the climate and energy portfolio. \u201cNothing should be excluded or treated as sacrosanct,\u201d Butler said on Monday. \u201cThe area I had responsibility for \u2013 climate change and energy \u2013 must be part of that thorough examination, as should all of our taxation policies and the spending commitments they were directed at funding.\u201d Butler declared that after a federal election where Labor had its \u201cbackside handed to [it] by Fozzie Bear and Kermit the Frog \u2013 it\u2019s time for some serious reflection\u201d. Activity in support of the motion comes as new research has found Australians are increasingly concerned about droughts and floods, extinctions and water shortages associated with climate change, and most people think all levels of government aren\u2019t doing enough to combat the effects of global warming. Authorities have warned that early spring bushfires in Queensland may go on for weeks. Firefighters on Tuesday were battling more than 50 fires in New South Wales. The overall fire danger index has increased for most of southern Australia over the past 40 years and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre says the trend is expected to continue. But Australia\u2019s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday while the climate is changing, he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow if climate change is manmade\u201d.",

He is David Teoh, the TPG boss who is due to break the habits of a lifetime by facing the cameras \u2013 and the court \u2013 in Melbourne on Wednesday. Teoh is to give evidence to the federal court as part of a challenge mounted by TPG and Vodafone against a decision by the competition regulator to stop the two telecommunications companies merging. It is a case that involves national security, the tantalising possibility of cheaper mobile phone access and the 64-year-old Teoh\u2019s ability to step back from day-to-day management of the business he has built over the past 27 years. At stake, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, is the possibility of a fourth mobile phone network that would compete with the market\u2019s dominant players, Telstra and Optus. Vodafone already has its own, smaller network, and until recently TPG was planning to roll out one too. But in August last year the federal government imposed what everyone involved in the case, except the ACCC, calls a \u201cban\u201d on the use of technology built by Chinese company Huawei to build 5G mobile networks. (The ACCC prefers to call then communications minister Mitch Fifield\u2019s instructions \u201csecurity guidance\u201d.) On Tuesday the court heard that by late January TPG had decided the ban meant it could no longer go ahead with building its own mobile network \u2013 although contact between the company and another potential supplier, Ericsson, continued until July. Through their lawyers, both TPG and Vodafone insisted it was now commercially and technically impossible for TPG to go it alone and build a viable rival network. TPG\u2019s counsel, Ruth Higgins SC, said radio spectrum that TPG splashed out $1.2bn on in 2017 as part of its plans to build the network was now an asset that was wasting away. \u201cThey\u2019ve depreciated in value and they\u2019ve not generated any revenue,\u201d she said. These are the issues Teoh will be asked to confront on Wednesday. Asking the questions will be the man who, as counsel assisting last year\u2019s banking royal commission, helped end the careers of NAB\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, and chairman, Ken Henry. Onlookers will be hoping Teoh is more forthcoming than the Vodafone chief executive, I\u00f1aki Berroeta. Another ACCC lawyer, Catherine Button QC, had great difficulty drawing even the most basic information from him during evidence on Tuesday. At one point, Button asked Berroeta whether Vodafone had a comparable amount of spectrum per customer in Sydney and Melbourne. \u201cComparable? I don\u2019t understand what comparable means,\u201d Berroeta responded. The case continues.",

Ironically the only real surprise is how little of a surprise his latest moves are.</p> <p>First was the warning a few days ago that \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 Israeli-Arab voters \u2013 were trying to steal next week\u2019s election, while he has been thwarted by the left and media in his plan to stop it (blocking the naked voter-suppression tactic of putting cameras in polling stations).</p> <p>Next up was the promise on Tuesday that if he won again, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/netanyahu-vows-annex-large-parts-occupied-west-bank-trump\">Israel would annex the Jordan valley and the northern Dead Sea</a>, while suggesting more annexation might be on the cards in the occupied West Bank when Donald Trump finally unveils his \u201cpeace plan\u201d.</p> <p>If it sounds familiar, it is because Israeli voters, Palestinians \u2013 and the world at large \u2013 have seen this show before.</p> <p>In 2015 Netanyahu made a similar play, goading supporters with his infamous claim that \u201cArab voters are coming out in droves\u201d while insisting that Israel would build anywhere it chose inside Jerusalem and never withdraw from the occupied territories. Then Netanyahu was speaking then Barack Obama was in the White House, a president with whom he did not see eye to eye.</p> <p>If the language is harsher and bolder this time round \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/07/israel-faces-second-election-nobody-wants-benjamin-netanyahu\">the second election in six months in Israel</a> \u2013 it is because it is far from certain that Trump would resist any moves towards annexation, after he controversially moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognised Israel\u2019s claim over the Golan Heights.</p> <p>What once was talk now seems very possible with Trump\u2019s backing.</p> <p>And while Israel has long insisted it needs to remain in the Jordan valley to maintain a \u201csecurity buffer\u201d beside the Jordan River, it is perhaps significant that it is this area he has said he would annex first rather than Jewish settlements in other parts of the occupied Palestinian territories.</p> <p>It was a threat that Netanyahu has reiterated in recent months, most recently at the end of August, when he said during a speech in the West Bank settlement of Elkana that he planned to extend \u201cJewish sovereignty to all the settlements as part of the [biblical] land of Israel, as part of the state of Israel\u201d.</p> <p>So how to interpret Netanyahu\u2019s latest statement? Perhaps by what he did not say out loud.</p> <p>What is clear is that he believes the possibility of such a move may be shrinking \u2013 \u201ca historic opportunity that we may not have again\u201d \u2013 if Trump does not win re-election.</p> <p>That phrasing also suggests that \u2013 for all the bluster \u2013 Netanyahu is not entirely certain that annexation of all the settlements will necessarily be accepted by the Trump White House, even if and when the Trump peace plan is finally published, allegedly a day after next week\u2019s election.</p> <p>The reality too is that, Washington\u2019s possible support notwithstanding, any move to annex any of the occupied territories is certain to be sharply rejected by the vast majority of the international community and would critically undermine Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to rally support for his hardline strategy against Tehran.</p> <p>So while it is grabbing the headlines, it remains a half-promise by an anxious politician under criminal investigation, and one that is contingent on US support.</p> <p>But above all it is a simple and naked electoral gambit by a populist leader who has schooled the world repeatedly in the viability of such crude electoral stunts.</p> <p>What is certain, as the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, quickly responded, is that any annexation \u2013 partial or otherwise \u2013 of occupied Palestinian land would destroy the last pretence of any remnant of a peace process \u2013 with Netanyahu as its \u201cprime destroyer\u201d.</p>",

First was the warning a few days ago that \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 Israeli-Arab voters \u2013 were trying to steal next week\u2019s election, while he has been thwarted by the left and media in his plan to stop it (blocking the naked voter-suppression tactic of putting cameras in polling stations). Next up was the promise on Tuesday that if he won again, Israel would annex the Jordan valley and the northern Dead Sea, while suggesting more annexation might be on the cards in the occupied West Bank when Donald Trump finally unveils his \u201cpeace plan\u201d. If it sounds familiar, it is because Israeli voters, Palestinians \u2013 and the world at large \u2013 have seen this show before. In 2015 Netanyahu made a similar play, goading supporters with his infamous claim that \u201cArab voters are coming out in droves\u201d while insisting that Israel would build anywhere it chose inside Jerusalem and never withdraw from the occupied territories. Then Netanyahu was speaking then Barack Obama was in the White House, a president with whom he did not see eye to eye. If the language is harsher and bolder this time round \u2013 in the second election in six months in Israel \u2013 it is because it is far from certain that Trump would resist any moves towards annexation, after he controversially moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognised Israel\u2019s claim over the Golan Heights. What once was talk now seems very possible with Trump\u2019s backing. And while Israel has long insisted it needs to remain in the Jordan valley to maintain a \u201csecurity buffer\u201d beside the Jordan River, it is perhaps significant that it is this area he has said he would annex first rather than Jewish settlements in other parts of the occupied Palestinian territories. It was a threat that Netanyahu has reiterated in recent months, most recently at the end of August, when he said during a speech in the West Bank settlement of Elkana that he planned to extend \u201cJewish sovereignty to all the settlements as part of the [biblical] land of Israel, as part of the state of Israel\u201d. So how to interpret Netanyahu\u2019s latest statement? Perhaps by what he did not say out loud. What is clear is that he believes the possibility of such a move may be shrinking \u2013 \u201ca historic opportunity that we may not have again\u201d \u2013 if Trump does not win re-election. That phrasing also suggests that \u2013 for all the bluster \u2013 Netanyahu is not entirely certain that annexation of all the settlements will necessarily be accepted by the Trump White House, even if and when the Trump peace plan is finally published, allegedly a day after next week\u2019s election. The reality too is that, Washington\u2019s possible support notwithstanding, any move to annex any of the occupied territories is certain to be sharply rejected by the vast majority of the international community and would critically undermine Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to rally support for his hardline strategy against Tehran. So while it is grabbing the headlines, it remains a half-promise by an anxious politician under criminal investigation, and one that is contingent on US support. But above all it is a simple and naked electoral gambit by a populist leader who has schooled the world repeatedly in the viability of such crude electoral stunts. What is certain, as the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, quickly responded, is that any annexation \u2013 partial or otherwise \u2013 of occupied Palestinian land would destroy the last pretence of any remnant of a peace process \u2013 with Netanyahu as its \u201cprime destroyer\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Paul Cattermole is explaining what it\u2019s like to be famous. \u201cI\u2019ve been on stage and seen a bra swirling in the air, coming to land on my head,\u201d he says. \u201cI tended to duck out of the way.\u201d He chuckles at the memory \u2013 surreal now, 20 years later, as he sits, untroubled by undergarments. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it happens all the time, because it doesn\u2019t. But it has happened.\u201d</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium, Cattermole, 42, was one-seventh of a famous whole. S Club 7 were presented to the world by impresario Simon Fuller \u2013 looking to repeat his success with the Spice Girls \u2013 as a fully formed pop package: four girls, three boys, singing, dancing, acting. (The \u201cS\u201d is rumoured to stand for \u201cSimon\u201d.)</p> <p>The public got to know Jo O\u2019Meara, Bradley McIntosh, Hannah Spearritt, Jon Lee, Tina Barrett, Rachel Stevens and Cattermole playing versions of themselves on their CBBC series, Miami 7, about a British pop group trying to break America. \u201cThe Monkees for the next generation\u201d was one comparison.</p> <p>When the show\u2019s bouncy theme song, Bring It All Back, was released at the end of the season, it shot to No 1 in the UK. Between 1998 and 2002, the group scored three more No 1s \u2013 as well as hits in Europe, Australasia and the US \u2013 and recorded four albums. There were four more TV series and, in 2001, a spin-off group: S Club Juniors.</p> <p>Promotional press introduced the seven members, aged from 16 to 21: their roles, traits, favourite colours and foods. Bradley was cheeky; Hannah, hyper. Jon was the joker. Jo: raucous. Rachel: fiery. Tina: chatty. Cattermole? \u201cEnthusiastic.\u201d (And liked guacamole.) They were central to what was being bought and sold \u2013 often quite literally, as Hasbro dolls or in lyrics namechecking various brands. You might remember the G-funk jam S Club Party, my personal favourite, in which \u2013 as Tina did her dance and Jon looked for romance \u2013 Paul was getting down on the floor while Hannah screamed out for more.</p> <p>Though O\u2019Meara and McIntosh shouldered most of the singing, and Stevens seemed to have the most commercial potential, no one member was a standout star \u2013 their success was symbiotic, dependent on being a gang anyone could join.</p> <p>I was seven in 1998, and there really was no party like an S Club Party. \u201cThe style and energy that was portrayed was coming from us, entirely,\u201d Cattermole says. \u201cThere was no management in that. The actual thing that people were buying into came from us. And to see people get hundreds of millions of pounds, and all the credit \u2013 no. We created that sort of fun energy on our own, despite the pressure they put on us.\u201d</p> <p>Cattermole had very nearly not joined S Club 7. \u201cI honestly was very unsure,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked so many times, \u2018Were you sitting by the phone, just waiting?\u2019 But when they did phone me up and offer it to me \u2013 \u2018Hi, we\u2019re so pleased to \u2026\u2019 \u2013 I remember putting the phone down and going: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I want to do that.\u2019 I turned to my friends and said: \u2018If I do this, my life is never going to be the same again.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As a teenager in St Albans, Hertfordshire, he had dreams of making it with his rock covers band or as a character actor. Performing came naturally, he says. </p> <p>Other members of S Club 7 had been chosen from thousands of applicants at \u201ccattle calls\u201d, what we think of today as X Factor-style; Cattermole never even auditioned. Once in the group, he never had to sing. \u201cThat got me down.\u201d</p> <p>He was told it would be at odds with \u201cthe alchemy\u201d, he says sarcastically, imitating a showbiz suit: \u201c\u2018We have picked certain people to do certain roles.\u2019 I can only assume that mine was to answer questions in interviews. I was never asked to show, in the audition process, my singing, my ability to dance \u2013 my ability for anything, other than talking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50a4fba24442af355b80dd3359b3ce45965688c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50a4fba24442af355b80dd3359b3ce45965688c8/0_94_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo O\u2019Meara, Paul Cattermole, Bradley McIntosh, Hannah Spearritt, Tina Barrett, Rachel Stevens, Jon Lee in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo O\u2019Meara, Paul Cattermole, Bradley McIntosh, Hannah Spearritt, Tina Barrett, Rachel Stevens, Jon Lee in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And not much talking, at that. \u201cTop of the Pops magazine, Smash Hits, all this sort of stuff was massive: \u2018So Paul, what\u2019s your favourite colour?\u2019\u201d He puts his face in his hands in mock desperation. \u201cPlease! Ask me about the theory of relativity!\u201d (Those bios from 1998 did say that his favourite subject at school was physics.)</p> <p>Cattermole paints pop stardom as a boring, thankless existence: a lot of \u201cschmoozing at parties\u201d and being driven around in the back of Chryslers, looking at magazines. \u201cI\u2019m as down for flicking through Heat magazine as the next one: \u2018Ooh, yeah, look at those shoes.\u2019 But not day after day, hour after hour.\u201d</p> <p>The perks of plush restaurants and hotels wore off \u201cimmediately\u201d \u2013 not that there was much of that. \u201cWe did everything ourselves, as far as I can remember, from laundry to food preparation.\u201d </p> <p>And mostly to make other people money. Cattermole says that Fuller was signed to Polydor as S Club 7, while he and the other six were just affiliates: \u201cthe worst situation to be in.\u201d He remembers being unable to afford a \u00a3100 bottle of wine even as he was in \u201cone of the world\u2019s biggest pop groups\u201d, and seizes on my mention of the Hasbro dolls: \u201cWe got a pittance for that.\u201d</p> <p>But they had each other. Cattermole says he got on with McIntosh (his closest friend) and Lee and Spearritt (\u201cthe nucleus\u201d of the group) in particular. \u201cWe were closer than many pop groups \u2013 people that used to work with us said: \u2018Wow, you guys actually speak, you actually stay in the same room.\u2019 Most of them don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2002, Cattermole announced that he was leaving S Club 7, ostensibly to pursue his old band, now named Skua and doing nu-metal. \u201cIt had got to the point where things were being handled so badly, I had to go.\u201d</p> <p>S Club 7 were riding high with their second Brit award for Don\u2019t Stop Movin\u2019, named Best British Single and the seventh-bestselling single of 2001. It was a new, more sophisticated sound for the group, more Billie Jean than bubblegum (in fact Michael Jackson was given a co-writing credit).

Cattermole, O\u2019Meara and McIntosh formed S Club 3 in 2008; a rotating lineup from the group continues to perform, including Spearritt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FalmouthWeek/status/1162457418162495489\" title=\"\">for the first time</a> last month.</p> <p>The extent of Cattermole\u2019s money troubles came to light last year after he was found to be <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5365168/s-clubs-paul-cattermole-confirms-he-did-sell-brit-award-for-60k-on-ebay/\" title=\"\">selling his Brit award</a> on eBay for a reported \u00a360,000. In an appearance on <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/loose-women-viewers-slate-humiliating-paul-cattermole-interview-a3761916.html\" title=\"\">Loose Women</a> that some criticised as exploitative, Cattermole said that he owed some \u00a330,000 in taxes and more in legal fees. His share from the 2015 S Club 7 reunion tour went towards clearing his debts.</p> <p>Explosively, Cattermole tells me that his five-year relationship with Spearritt was written into their Hollywood 7 TV show \u2013 \u201cand because of that, it sort of happened\u201d. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1608000/1608993.stm\" title=\"\">Reports at the time</a> said they had been secretly dating for six months, necessitating their on-screen kiss, but Cattermole says that was not the case \u2013 it did not happen organically.</p> <p>He was forced into the relationship? \u201cYeah, but like I say. It didn\u2019t feel like that because I had totally grown into the idea, quite quickly. I thought she was great.\u201d In 2017, Spearritt <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4867585/eastenders-hannah-spearritt-s-club-7-paul-cattermole-broke-tragic/\" title=\"\">lashed out</a> at Cattermole online for speaking publicly about their relationship.</p> <p>For the past year and a half Cattermole has lived in Swanage, in Dorset, where his family are based; he has been working odd jobs, most recently as manager of a community radio station. This Thursday he makes a heartwarming appearance on Channel 4\u2019s First Dates Hotel, where he grapples with how to disclose to his date his background as \u201can entertainer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was five years of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely thought, when I was 20, that by the time I was 40 it would be a done thing. And it\u2019s not \u2026 I\u2019ve been answering S Club questions for 20 years. It will be great \u2013 it will be bliss \u2013 to one day not have to, but it\u2019s part of it, and I totally accept that.\u201d</p> <p>In July, Stevens teased a reunion <a href=\"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/lorraine-kelly-rachel-stevens-club-18672621\" title=\"\">on the Lorraine Kelly show</a> to mark the 20th anniversary of their debut album but Cattermole seems to think it unlikely. \u201cThe other guys know I\u2019m up for doing it, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>A manager had approached him about it but was \u201crude and offensive\u201d \u2013 typical, he says, of his experience of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame that the whole thing has been crushed and crushed and crushed \u2026 I\u2019ve been in meetings and they\u2019ve said, \u2018No but Paul, legacy, legacy, legacy, you\u2019ve got to do the gig because it\u2019s the legacy.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe music\u2019s there, the TV shows are there \u2013 that\u2019s the legacy.\u201d He still gets approached by fans wanting a selfie, who say that S Club 7 helped them through a difficult period in their lives or their GCSEs. \u201cThat is nine times out of 10 the way it goes.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to think of any contemporary music, or even culture, that is as wholeheartedly upbeat. As we\u2019re wrapping up, I tell Cattermole that I still associate their music with the <em>optimism</em> of the millennium. He leaps on the word.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so important to remember how great so many things about the band were and, like you said, that time in people\u2019s lives. That optimistic time.\u201d</p> <p><em>Paul Cattermole is on First Dates Hotel on Thursday 12 September on Channel 4. </em></p>",

S Club, as the group was known post-Cattermole, hung on for one more year, announcing their split on stage in April 2003. For all the No 1s, the world tours, the multi-million-pound merchandising and endorsement deals \u2013 including one with Pepsi \u2013 S Club 7 saw very little of their success in monetary terms.

The extent of Cattermole\u2019s money troubles came to light last year after he was found to be selling his Brit award on eBay for a reported \u00a360,000. In an appearance on Loose Women that some criticised as exploitative, Cattermole said that he owed some \u00a330,000 in taxes and more in legal fees. His share from the 2015 S Club 7 reunion tour went towards clearing his debts. Explosively, Cattermole tells me that his five-year relationship with Spearritt was written into their Hollywood 7 TV show \u2013 \u201cand because of that, it sort of happened\u201d. Reports at the time said they had been secretly dating for six months, necessitating their on-screen kiss, but Cattermole says that was not the case \u2013 it did not happen organically. He was forced into the relationship? \u201cYeah, but like I say. It didn\u2019t feel like that because I had totally grown into the idea, quite quickly. I thought she was great.\u201d In 2017, Spearritt lashed out at Cattermole online for speaking publicly about their relationship. For the past year and a half Cattermole has lived in Swanage, in Dorset, where his family are based; he has been working odd jobs, most recently as manager of a community radio station. This Thursday he makes a heartwarming appearance on Channel 4\u2019s First Dates Hotel, where he grapples with how to disclose to his date his background as \u201can entertainer\u201d. \u201cIt was five years of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely thought, when I was 20, that by the time I was 40 it would be a done thing. And it\u2019s not \u2026 I\u2019ve been answering S Club questions for 20 years. It will be great \u2013 it will be bliss \u2013 to one day not have to, but it\u2019s part of it, and I totally accept that.\u201d In July, Stevens teased a reunion on the Lorraine Kelly show to mark the 20th anniversary of their debut album but Cattermole seems to think it unlikely. \u201cThe other guys know I\u2019m up for doing it, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d A manager had approached him about it but was \u201crude and offensive\u201d \u2013 typical, he says, of his experience of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame that the whole thing has been crushed and crushed and crushed \u2026 I\u2019ve been in meetings and they\u2019ve said, \u2018No but Paul, legacy, legacy, legacy, you\u2019ve got to do the gig because it\u2019s the legacy.\u2019 \u201cThe music\u2019s there, the TV shows are there \u2013 that\u2019s the legacy.\u201d He still gets approached by fans wanting a selfie, who say that S Club 7 helped them through a difficult period in their lives or their GCSEs. \u201cThat is nine times out of 10 the way it goes.\u201d It is hard to think of any contemporary music, or even culture, that is as wholeheartedly upbeat. As we\u2019re wrapping up, I tell Cattermole that I still associate their music with the optimism of the millennium. He leaps on the word. \u201cIt is so important to remember how great so many things about the band were and, like you said, that time in people\u2019s lives. That optimistic time.\u201d Paul Cattermole is on First Dates Hotel on Thursday 12 September on Channel 4.",

John Philpott, the director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said there was a near standstill in private sector job creation, accounting for only 2,000 of the 31,000 additional people in work over the three-month period. Public sector jobs, mostly in the NHS and education, were the prime source of continued market buoyancy. \u201cThese latest figures confirm recent signs of softening in the UK labour market. Recruitment appears to have weakened most noticeably in smaller private sector businesses, though it is unclear to what extent this reflects prolonged uncertainty over Brexit or a broader slowdown in the economy,\u201d he said. Jobs growth has been driven in recent years by rising numbers of women in work, as well as rapid increases in older workers staying in their roles longer. The ONS said changes in the state pension age for women had resulted in fewer retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. The estimated employment rate for women has reached 72.1%, marking the joint-highest level since comparable records began in 1971. The Resolution Foundation said the rise in average pay was encouraging for British workers, but said employment growth was only just managing to keep pace with population increases. Nye Cominetti, an economic analyst at the foundation, said: \u201cWith the UK labour market appearing to have settled into a healthy holding pattern, the key task for policymakers is to keep it there. Most obviously this means avoiding unnecessary economic shocks.\u201d The chancellor, Sajid Javid, said rising wage growth and government tax cuts were helping households take home more money. He added: \u201cWe want to support hardworking people to succeed and provide for their families.\u201d",

But that doesn\u2019t mean he has given up on the idea. Or, rather, it isn\u2019t certain that the battle between Johnson\u2019s conflicting instincts has been settled. He reads from the Trump playbook at home, but puts it hastily down when grownup EU leaders enter the room. He is too weak-willed to play the typical nationalist strongman.

Johnson is so far short of a majority that Arlene Foster\u2019s party can\u2019t get him over the line. That doesn\u2019t make it easier for the prime minister to ratify a Brexit deal, but it does remove a privileged power of veto from the unionist ultras. One reason to suppose that Johnson is malleable on the detail is that on 29 March he voted for May\u2019s deal \u2013 the same one he denounces as an affront to democracy. The hypocrisy is not surprising, but it does illuminate that tension in Johnson\u2019s self-image, between the wannabe statesman and the Trump tribute act. One enjoys the hobnobbing with world leaders at global summits, the other is an accomplice in vandalising the architecture of a rules-based international order. The same tension is expressed in domestic politics. There is affable Boris who thought he could charm his way to an elegant Brexit solution, unify his party and woo the country with a healing message. He was barged aside by bullying Boris who purges dissent from his party and stokes division in the country. One belongs to the old Tory party that venerated stability and reached out to liberal voters. The other leads a new revolutionary leaver party, recruiting admirers of Nigel Farage for a nationalist insurgency. The Downing Street calculation appears to be that a majority is most easily won by stripping the Conservative party down and reassembling it as something unconservative. Johnson will run as a populist tribune, the man who would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than surrender to tricky continentals and their Westminster collaborators. It might work. Current polling doesn\u2019t offer much of a guide when the vital choices have been punted to the end of October. That doesn\u2019t leave much time for the prime minister to tweak May\u2019s Brexit deal and, in defiance of all the odds, persuade a hostile parliament to vote for it. But that doesn\u2019t mean he has given up on the idea. Or, rather, it isn\u2019t certain that the battle between Johnson\u2019s conflicting instincts has been settled. He reads from the Trump playbook at home, but puts it hastily down when grownup EU leaders enter the room. He is too weak-willed to play the typical nationalist strongman. He saddled the populist tiger and rode it towards a no-deal Brexit, but look closely and you see a queasy expression, as if there is a part of him that wants to get off. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

However, there\u2019s a problem \u2013 it\u2019s their plan and not a shared plan.</p> <p>Irrespective of whether the UK leaves the EU, farmers will remain dependent on public subsidy, so the public need to be on board with any NFU-backed plan on climate change. The big environmental organisations \u2013 including the RSPB, WWF, Friends of the Earth, the Wildlife Trusts \u2013 mediate large swathes of public opinion. Consequently the NFU needs to get round the table with them and develop a shared plan, centred on land use, to make farming climate-neutral.</p> <p>Only a shared plan to tackle the climate crisis, also involving the forestry sector, will lead to public willingness to continue large-scale taxpayers\u2019 support for UK farmers.A policy of public money for public benefit de-facto has to have public support. <br><strong>Paul Brannen</strong><br><em>Chair, North East England Nature Partnership</em></p> <p>\u2022 I agree wholeheartedly with Isabella Tree\u2019s advocacy of natural regeneration as the best way of achieving biodiversity (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/04/grow-your-own-forest-how-to-plant-trees-to-help-save-the-planet\" title=\"\">Tree-mendous! How to grow a healthier planet</a>, G2, 4 September). I spend much of my time working with landowners, commoners and the National Park to achieve such regeneration here on Dartmoor. However, regeneration goes at nature\u2019s pace, and humans need to proceed much more rapidly to increase carbon capture and rainfall management. Also, much as many of us might want to, we are not going to clear our hills and fells of sheep any time soon. Sheep, as selective grazers, seek out and eat first-year tree seedlings, thus acting as a severe brake on natural regeneration. So, in practice, there is still a substantial place for tree-planting in an effective broad-based strategy for environmental recovery.</p> <p>The charity to which I belong, Moor Trees, answers most of Ms Tree\u2019s objections by collecting locally native tree seeds from ancient and semi-natural woodland on or very near Dartmoor, raising trees from them in our own South Devon nurseries and planting them in the same area. We have to the best of my knowledge never felt the need to use glyphosate or any other chemical to prepare a planting site. We planted 8,000 trees last winter and have planted 90,000 since our foundation.</p> <p>This is a model that could reasonably easily be copied elsewhere in the country. Such an organisation, though substantially volunteer-run, has a basic annual overhead which, given the current public clamour for trees, is surprisingly difficult to fund. Philanthropic donors prefer new projects to established ones and, if they make offers, attach substantial match-funding conditions to them. People and organisations who see the value of \u201cecosystem services\u201d should now be beating a path to the doors of operations like ours.<br><strong>Tim Ferry</strong><br><em>Dartmoor, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 The simplest way for the UK to increase its tree population is to stop the (top) flailing of our hedgerows and to let what is already there grow. There are hundreds of thousands of trees, as biodiverse as you could wish for, already waiting in the hedgerows: our linear forests, just waiting to grow.And the way to make it happen...</p> <p>Just stop the (top) flailing of hedgerows. No time-consuming seed propagation, sapling planting or protective sleeves round treelets are needed. And no-flailing will also reduce the amount of diesel-heavy tractor miles that are used to slay the hedges, and will allow millions of eager tree stunts to flourish and grow into proper trees.</p> <p>The biodiversity benefits for the environment when hedgerows are allowed to grow again will bring tears to the eyes as to what we have lost in this field over the past decades.<br><strong>Alec Owen</strong><br><em>Exeter</em></p> <p>\u2022 If we are to improve the fate of our heather (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/05/climate-emergency-to-blame-for-heather-crisis-national-trust\" title=\"\">Climate emergency to blame for heather crisis \u2013 National Trust</a>, 5 September) much more needs to be learned about heather beetle outbreaks, which appear to be increasing in severity. The general advice is that burning or cutting of affected heather, following an outbreak, will assist restoration of damaged moorland. Evidence suggests that the reason the UK has largely retained its heather moorland is the management for driven grouse shooting.

      "bodyText": "It is good news that the National Farmers\u2019 Union has developed a plan for British farming to become carbon neutral by 2040 (UK can meet climate targets without beef cuts, say NFU, 10 September). However, there\u2019s a problem \u2013 it\u2019s their plan and not a shared plan. Irrespective of whether the UK leaves the EU, farmers will remain dependent on public subsidy, so the public need to be on board with any NFU-backed plan on climate change. The big environmental organisations \u2013 including the RSPB, WWF, Friends of the Earth, the Wildlife Trusts \u2013 mediate large swathes of public opinion. Consequently the NFU needs to get round the table with them and develop a shared plan, centred on land use, to make farming climate-neutral. Only a shared plan to tackle the climate crisis, also involving the forestry sector, will lead to public willingness to continue large-scale taxpayers\u2019 support for UK farmers.A policy of public money for public benefit de-facto has to have public support. Paul Brannen Chair, North East England Nature Partnership \u2022 I agree wholeheartedly with Isabella Tree\u2019s advocacy of natural regeneration as the best way of achieving biodiversity (Tree-mendous! How to grow a healthier planet, G2, 4 September). I spend much of my time working with landowners, commoners and the National Park to achieve such regeneration here on Dartmoor. However, regeneration goes at nature\u2019s pace, and humans need to proceed much more rapidly to increase carbon capture and rainfall management. Also, much as many of us might want to, we are not going to clear our hills and fells of sheep any time soon. Sheep, as selective grazers, seek out and eat first-year tree seedlings, thus acting as a severe brake on natural regeneration. So, in practice, there is still a substantial place for tree-planting in an effective broad-based strategy for environmental recovery. The charity to which I belong, Moor Trees, answers most of Ms Tree\u2019s objections by collecting locally native tree seeds from ancient and semi-natural woodland on or very near Dartmoor, raising trees from them in our own South Devon nurseries and planting them in the same area. We have to the best of my knowledge never felt the need to use glyphosate or any other chemical to prepare a planting site. We planted 8,000 trees last winter and have planted 90,000 since our foundation. This is a model that could reasonably easily be copied elsewhere in the country. Such an organisation, though substantially volunteer-run, has a basic annual overhead which, given the current public clamour for trees, is surprisingly difficult to fund. Philanthropic donors prefer new projects to established ones and, if they make offers, attach substantial match-funding conditions to them. People and organisations who see the value of \u201cecosystem services\u201d should now be beating a path to the doors of operations like ours. Tim Ferry Dartmoor, Devon \u2022 The simplest way for the UK to increase its tree population is to stop the (top) flailing of our hedgerows and to let what is already there grow. There are hundreds of thousands of trees, as biodiverse as you could wish for, already waiting in the hedgerows: our linear forests, just waiting to grow.And the way to make it happen... Just stop the (top) flailing of hedgerows. No time-consuming seed propagation, sapling planting or protective sleeves round treelets are needed. And no-flailing will also reduce the amount of diesel-heavy tractor miles that are used to slay the hedges, and will allow millions of eager tree stunts to flourish and grow into proper trees. The biodiversity benefits for the environment when hedgerows are allowed to grow again will bring tears to the eyes as to what we have lost in this field over the past decades. Alec Owen Exeter \u2022 If we are to improve the fate of our heather (Climate emergency to blame for heather crisis \u2013 National Trust, 5 September) much more needs to be learned about heather beetle outbreaks, which appear to be increasing in severity. The general advice is that burning or cutting of affected heather, following an outbreak, will assist restoration of damaged moorland. Evidence suggests that the reason the UK has largely retained its heather moorland is the management for driven grouse shooting. Grouse moor management has, arguably, also improved the resilience of dwarf-shrub heathers in the face of disease and pest species such as the heather beetle. The retention of both economic and environmental incentives for moorland management need to be maintained to build resilience and mitigate climate change. Ross MacLeod Head of policy at GWCT (Scotland) \u2022 In response to your article (Plans for first carbon-neutral industrial area in Britain, 9 September), Drax Power is not only a coal-fired power station, but it is also the world\u2019s biggest burner of wood biomass for electricity. Much of this wood comes from the clear-felling of biodiverse wetland forests in the southern US and last year, Drax burned 14m tonnes of wood and emitted 13m tonnes of CO2. Drax is also planning to build the UK\u2019s largest fossil gas power station. This is hardly conducive with a carbon-neutral Humber. Your article also fails to mention that Drax\u2019s proposed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage project is an unproven technology which has never worked. Even if it did work, it is far from carbon neutral and would rely on continuing to burn millions of tonnes of trees. In fact, closing down Drax would cut the UK\u2019s carbon emissions by 17m tonnes a year and would be a vital step in enabling the Humber to become carbon-neutral. Rather than relying on false climate solutions, we need to invest in the protection and restoration of natural forests and the creation of green jobs in genuinely low-carbon renewable energy. Sally Clark (UK bioenergy campaigner for Biofuelwatch), Giffnock, East Renfrewshire \u2022 It is good to know that sales of battery electric cars have doubled in the past year (Tesla accelerates to third place for UK car sales, 6 September). But, as the piece notes, pure electric cars represent only 1.1% of this year\u2019s total car sales. Is a reason for this the lack of coverage, good and bad, in the media? I bought my two-year-old Nissan Leaf a month ago for half the price of a new Tesla. It has less range, of course, but in every other way it is an excellent introduction to this new world.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove\u2019s description of retiring Speaker John Bercow as the backbenchers\u2019 backstop is spot on (Candidates line up to replace Speaker after Bercow tells MPs he will resign, 10 September). But Bercow has not only enabled parliament to challenge the government\u2019s position on Brexit, he has entertained and thrilled us with his oratory and wit. His hilarious interventions have made the last three years not only bearable but frankly enjoyable. Bercow has enhanced Britain\u2019s reputation abroad as a thriving democracy and others look on wishing they had a Speaker like him to invigorate their own parliaments. He has been the longest running one-man show in the West End and will be an impossible act to follow. Stan Labovitch Windsor, Berkshire \u2022 Anyone doubting or denying that the outgoing Speaker ever operated in a devious manner only need look at his proposed date for leaving. The timing of John Bercow\u2019s resignation was obviously engineered to pave a clear path for another remain-supporting Speaker to succeed him to the chair. Stefan Badham Portsmouth, Hampshire \u2022 Andrea Leadsom and her colleagues attack John Bercow for his \u201cflagrant abuse\u201d of parliamentary process (Tories will stand against Speaker at next election, 9 September). Bercow then announces he is standing down. Brexiters immediately call him a coward and a chicken. A perfect example of how some people wish to be confrontational whatever the situation. Toby Wood Peterborough, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Unlikely scenario \u2013 John Bercow at one of the Commons bars with the prime minister (Johnson at the time of writing) and the MP for the constituency in which I live (Rees-Mogg): \u201cOne for your respective ditches \u2018gentlemen\u2019?\u201d. \u201cOne for the ditch\u201d being a phrase at last orders when everyone has had quite enough already.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a pity the anonymous pilot (I don\u2019t want to strike, but BA has left me with no choice, 10 September) wasn\u2019t given the space to list some of the eye-watering benefits he receives. The pay system he mentions is tax-efficient, meaning that the pilots pay themselves minimum wage and the rest of the remuneration is \u201ccompany profits\u201d taxed at 20%. He forgot to mention that senior pilots get guaranteed first-class flights for themselves and their families. Captains also get meal allowances that are 10% above those of the rest of the crew. When I joined BOAC in 1970, flight crew retired at 55, while cabin crew worked until 65. As for safety, the cynical among us would say that provided the flight crew get off alive then so do the rest of us! A senior aircraft designer once told me that his ideal flight deck was a pilot and a dog, the pilot to feed the dog and the dog to attack the pilot if he ever touched a control. In-cabin problems are almost exclusively handled by cabin crew at a fraction of pilots\u2019 salaries. In an emergency, the evacuation of passengers would be the remit of that same cabin crew. Allan McRobert Kirkcaldy, Fife \u2022 The first-ever strike by British Airways pilots (BA flights grounded as pilots stage first-ever strike on pay, 9 September), and other long-running disputes at Ryanair and with train operators, reveal what happens when antagonism in industrial relations becomes entrenched. Strikes always end, but the lessons are not always learned. There is a need for better education about the employment relationship, to enhance society\u2019s understanding of the politics of work. Workers\u2019 rights should be taught in schools, colleges and universities, and there should be more industry and employment journalists and employment relations managers.

the Tory-turned-Lib Dem MP who chairs the Commons liaison committee, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking a promise to appear before her committee this week. In an interview for Newsnight she explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m appalled. The prime minister is running away from scrutiny. We had a series of reassurances from him over the summer that he would come to the liaison committee \u2013 initially before parliament came back, so on the first Monday. He then moved that date to this coming Wednesday and we very specifically queried with him about the position of prorogation and he assured us that he would be coming to liaison. </p> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid that is a promise broken because he has prorogued parliament and select committees can\u2019t sit. But in fact we decided that we would invite him anyway \u2013 that we would come back and sit on an informal basis, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve heard today that he\u2019s not prepared to come.</p> \n   <p>He is unaccountable. We have seen how everything has unravelled, with just a week of scrutiny in parliament.

She was fleshing out an idea that Jeremy Corbyn promoted in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/corbyn-pidcock-announce-ministry-employment-rights-workers-protection-agency/\">his own speech</a>, in which<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/jeremy-corbyn-extension-workers-rights-labour-tuc-congress\"> he promised the biggest ever extension of workers\u2019 rights.</a></p> \n  <p>Pidock said Labour\u2019s new national joint advisory council would ensure the voices of workers were heard around the cabinet table. And she said that, under Labour\u2019s plans for national collective bargaining, employers would have to negotiate pay with unions. She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A Labour government will establish a Ministry of Employment Rights. The department will be responsible for transforming our workplaces by delivering a huge rollout of individual and collective rights at work and legislating for enforcement powers to make these rights meaningful.</p> \n   <p>It will establish a national joint advisory council for representatives of government, employers, unions and experts to meet and advise. Above all, this will mean that the voice of working people will be heard at the cabinet table, exactly as it should be.</p> \n   <p>The beating heart of this department will be the rollout of sectoral collective bargaining. Now, I realise that this concept may be familiar to people in this room, but people outside of this room may be wondering what on earth I\u2019m talking about, and I don\u2019t blame them. Because the percentage of workers covered by collective agreements has dwindled rapidly over the last 40 years.</p> \n   <p>Our Labour government will re-establish national collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in each sector of our economy. That was the British way for most of the 20th century and it still is the way that the successful economies of northern Europe manage their industrial relations.</p> \n   <p>Sector-wide collective bargaining will set minimum and legally binding pay, terms and conditions for every employer and every worker in the sector.</p> \n   <p>In practice it means that rather than the employer having all the power to determine what your conditions and pay are at work, they will be legally obliged to enter into negotiation with your trade union \u2013 a giant step forward in rebalancing the unequal power relations that exist between worker and employer.</p> \n   <p>Imagine the transformative impact that would have on, say, the care sector, where the mostly female workforce has seen this highly skilled and professional area of work become a minimum wage job, where care workers are not paid for travel time between visits and can end up working 10 hours for five hours pay. What a scandalous state of affairs that the very people looking after some of the most poorly and vulnerable people in the country are being paid less than the minimum wage. And think of the effect on those in their care. Well, we are calling time on this kind of exploitative practice.</p> \n   <p>Because under a Labour government, those care sector employers would be legally obliged to come to the table and negotiate all aspects of the industry, the conditions in workplaces and, fundamentally, their pay. So, whether you are a care home worker from Dundee or Durham, you would be secure in the knowledge that minimum terms and conditions negotiated for the sector will restore dignity and a decent life to you and those you look after.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e742b568b268b2c17c6c92e8483dc4a11c7319\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e742b568b268b2c17c6c92e8483dc4a11c7319/0_108_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Pidcock at the TUC conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Pidcock at the TUC conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:48:30.578Z\">at 5.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77c9058f083106f4558ffd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:03:31.803Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The DUP leader, <strong>Arlene Foster</strong>, and her deputy, <strong>Nigel Dodds</strong>, have arrived at No 10 for talks with Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2761f9e17e16fbcd5edc63d6a1de08f383c268af\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2761f9e17e16fbcd5edc63d6a1de08f383c268af/0_5_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds arrive at Downing Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds arrive at Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:19:52.373Z\">at 5.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77bffc8f08143ee1ae3ad6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T15:24:06.623Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has secretly ordered the Cabinet Office to turn the government\u2019s public internet service into a platform for \u201ctargeted and personalised information\u201d to be gathered in the run-up to Brexit,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-voter-data\"> BuzzFeed is reporting.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77bd4e8f083106f4558f5a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T15:20:40.068Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Northern Ireland-only backstop 'simply a non-runner', says DUP</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson,</strong> the DUP chief whip, was on the World at One.

Slipping into franglais (he was sitting in on a French lesson), he used the interview to dismiss claims that proroguing parliament for five weeks was anti-democratic. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need a Queen\u2019s speech. That\u2019s why parliament is in recess now, because you always have a recess before a Queen\u2019s speech.

According to <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2019-0111/LLN-2019-0111.xlsx\">this House of Lords library briefing (pdf)</a>, it will be the longest prorogation since 1930. </p> \n  <p>In his interview, Johnson also insisted that he was getting on with addressing the priorities of the people - which he said meant not just delivering Brexit by 31 October, but investing in the police and schools and hospitals.

He has been more critical of the UK\u2019s Brexit stance than other European commissioners, giving a speech last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news?page=with:block-5d5d4cee8f081cf11cf1a715#block-5d5d4cee8f081cf11cf1a715\">describing Johnson as an \u201cunelected PM\u201d who was \u201cgambling with peace\u201d.</a> As trade commissioner, Hogan is there to represent the EU, not Ireland. But if it ever gets to the point where the UK will be hoping for the EU to downplay Irish concerns in the negotiations, Hogan is not likely to be cooperative.</p> \n  <p>But, on the plus side, Hogan is sounding more positive about the prospects of there being a Brexit deal than he was last month. In<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/penny-finally-dropping-for-uk-on-brexit-says-phil-hogan-1.4013645\"> an interview with the Irish Times</a> he said the penny was \u201cfinally dropping\u201d in the UK.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage \u2013 albeit at the eleventh hour \u2013 that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the two sides were heading in the direction of a Northern Ireland-only backstop, Hogan replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes. The taoiseach has indicated in the last 24 hours that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is quite an interesting idea to revisit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hogan also said Boris Johnson was shifting his stance. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone. That is certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU and the rest of the UK. This is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p> \n   <p>If we can build on that we certainly might get closer to one another in terms of a possible outcome.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hogan told the Irish Times that he would expect it to take \u201ca number of years\u201d to conclude a final trade deal with the EU. But he said that, because of the UK\u2019s long membership of the EU, the process should not take as long as normal trade deals.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bd74f86d9bf499666a8decf159f58a5f6d3d2f7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd74f86d9bf499666a8decf159f58a5f6d3d2f7/0_2_3045_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Hogan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Hogan.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virginia Mayo/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T15:36:24.148Z\">at 4.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77a3488f082514879f1690\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T13:21:37.331Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9e5becec10d2313459069c29e15dbe7954de9ed\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e5becec10d2313459069c29e15dbe7954de9ed/0_0_5364_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson attends a class during his visit to Pimlico primary school in London this afternoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson attends a class during his visit to Pimlico primary school in London this afternoon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77a0ba8f083106f4558dc8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T13:19:34.226Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>At the weekend there was speculation that <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, might follow Amber Rudd in resigning from the cabinet.

Many others have criticised the decision, of course, including Amber Rudd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/amber-rudd-resigns-from-cabinet-and-surrenders-conservative-whip\">when she resigned as work and pensions secretary at the weekend, </a>but given that Hague is someone whose default mode is loyalty to the party, his critique is remarkable. He describes what Johnson did as \u201ca disgusting act of hypocrisy\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All of us who have been Tory leader have made mistakes, but this one is the most egregious and counter-productive act of self-harm committed by the party leadership that I can recall in my lifetime.

Are the DUP about to join the club?</p> \n  <p>As my colleague <strong>Lisa O\u2019Carroll </strong>wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d766eaa8f083106f455841b#block-5d766eaa8f083106f455841b\">in a post</a> on this blog yesterday, there is increasing speculation that Boris Johnson is moving towards accepting some version of a Northern Ireland-only backstop as a solution to the Brexit crisis. Newsnight\u2019s <strong>Nicholas Watt</strong> went into this in more detail in a report yesterday. Here is an excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49639294\">a blog</a> setting out his understanding of Johnson\u2019s thinking.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Tories familiar with Boris Johnson\u2019s thinking say he is now willing to contemplate a version of the so-called \u201cNorthern Ireland-only backstop\u201d. Under this plan Northern Ireland would be closely bound to the EU on areas where there are already elements of an all Ireland economy \u2013 agriculture and electricity.</p> \n   <p>But Great Britain would be free to chart its own course. That would free GB to have a free trade agreement with the EU but would create a border down the Irish Sea. All of that could be achieved by amending the backstop in the Brexit withdrawal agreement to apply only to Northern Ireland. The separate political declaration would be amended to say that a Canada-plus trade deal would be negotiated for Great Britain. The government would be wary of calling the new mechanism a backstop, because it regards the current backstop as anti-democratic.</p> \n   <p>Downing St confirmed that a backstop in any form is unacceptable to the prime minister. But he is willing to recognise, as he told MPs last week, that \u201cagri-food is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there is potentially a big problem with this plan. The DUP would oppose anything that would create a new regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland (although Watt, in his blog, quotes one source explaining why a version of this proposal might be acceptable to the unionists).</p> \n  <p>This morning <strong>Arlene Foster,</strong> the DUP leader, spoke to Sky News before flying to London. She said she would be speaking to Johnson later. Asked about the suggestions that Johnson was planning a Northern Ireland-only backstop, she claimed this was \u201cvery wide of the mark\u201d. Perhaps she is right, but it did sound a little as if she was not 100% convinced and as if she was seeking to lay down a marker to the PM.</p> \n  <p>She told Sky News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about that ... What we\u2019re focused on is about getting a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom, one that works for Northern Ireland, one that does not have Northern Ireland hived off into a different customs union than the rest of the United Kingdom, breaking up the single market of the United Kingdom. That would be unheard off. To think that any United Kingdom prime minister would be involved in that sort of thing would just be an anathema. Jeremy Corbyn has said that in the past, our own prime minister has said that. So I think all of this speculation is very wide of the mark.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to her that some people might think she was being naive, and that Johnson was more committed to delivering Brexit than to sticking with the DUP, she replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What people are talking about is not delivering Brexit; what people are talking about is the break-up of the United Kingdom. That is not something that any prime minister in the United Kingdom is going to in any conscience go along with.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a76921799f868a7a24ddf3a5c036ac916e73f351\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a76921799f868a7a24ddf3a5c036ac916e73f351/20_0_888_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T09:15:55.278Z\">at 10.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77583b8f083106f4558a96\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T08:08:06.444Z\">9.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda for the day</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Parliament is not sitting, but there is still plenty of politics around.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused by the chair of the Commons liaison committee of breaking a specific promise to appear before it this week. (See 5.37pm.) Johnson has rejected as \u201cnonsense\u201d the claim that his lengthy prorogation of parliament is undemocratic. (See 3.46pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has promised to introduce the biggest ever extension to workers\u2019 rights and create a ministry and government agency should he get into government. The EU is pinning hopes on British negotiators reverting to the Northern Ireland-only backstop previously rejected by Theresa May as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK. DUP leaders rejected this proposal as unacceptable (see 9.58am and 4.20pm) Within the last hour Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has been meeting Johnson in Downing Street. The former Irish prime minister and joint architect of the Northern Ireland peace process, Bertie Ahern, has said it is imperative that any Brexit solution be acceptable to the DUP. A cross-party group of MPs has formally launched a campaign to win support in the Commons for Brexit via a managed deal, arguing both a no-deal departure or a second referendum would cement political divisions and cause endless uncertainty. Harriet Harman has promised to be \u201cscrupulously neutral\u201d as she announced her bid to become the next Speaker of the House of Commons, despite being a prominent campaigner for remain in the 2016 referendum. Past prime ministers, present-day parliamentarians, diplomats and armed services personnel filled Westminster Abbey to pay tribute to former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, described as \u201c a man for ideals, not shabby deals\u201d. The details of the service are on the Westminster Abbey website here. Johnson is being urged to withdraw Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s knighthood over his conviction for domestic violence and the former England cricketer\u2019s response to criticism. The first cracks have begun to emerge in Britain\u2019s resilient labour market as job creation slowed over the summer months, in a sign of the stress facing the UK economy as Brexit looms. Britain has accused Iran of flagrantly breaching assurances it would not sell oil to Syria from an Iranian tanker released by authorities in Gibraltar on the condition that the 2.1m barrels of oil would not sold to the \u201cmurderous regime\u201d of Bashar al Assad. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Sarah Wollaston, the Tory-turned-Lib Dem MP who chairs the Commons liaison committee, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking a promise to appear before her committee this week. In an interview for Newsnight she explained: I\u2019m appalled. The prime minister is running away from scrutiny. We had a series of reassurances from him over the summer that he would come to the liaison committee \u2013 initially before parliament came back, so on the first Monday. He then moved that date to this coming Wednesday and we very specifically queried with him about the position of prorogation and he assured us that he would be coming to liaison. I\u2019m afraid that is a promise broken because he has prorogued parliament and select committees can\u2019t sit. But in fact we decided that we would invite him anyway \u2013 that we would come back and sit on an informal basis, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve heard today that he\u2019s not prepared to come. He is unaccountable. We have seen how everything has unravelled, with just a week of scrutiny in parliament. And I suspect that he didn\u2019t want that to continue. Laura Pidcock, the shadow business minister, has set out more details of Labour\u2019s plans for national collective bargaining in a speech to the TUC this afternoon. She was fleshing out an idea that Jeremy Corbyn promoted in his own speech, in which he promised the biggest ever extension of workers\u2019 rights. Pidock said Labour\u2019s new national joint advisory council would ensure the voices of workers were heard around the cabinet table. And she said that, under Labour\u2019s plans for national collective bargaining, employers would have to negotiate pay with unions. She explained: A Labour government will establish a Ministry of Employment Rights. The department will be responsible for transforming our workplaces by delivering a huge rollout of individual and collective rights at work and legislating for enforcement powers to make these rights meaningful. It will establish a national joint advisory council for representatives of government, employers, unions and experts to meet and advise. Above all, this will mean that the voice of working people will be heard at the cabinet table, exactly as it should be. The beating heart of this department will be the rollout of sectoral collective bargaining. Now, I realise that this concept may be familiar to people in this room, but people outside of this room may be wondering what on earth I\u2019m talking about, and I don\u2019t blame them. Because the percentage of workers covered by collective agreements has dwindled rapidly over the last 40 years. Our Labour government will re-establish national collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in each sector of our economy. That was the British way for most of the 20th century and it still is the way that the successful economies of northern Europe manage their industrial relations. Sector-wide collective bargaining will set minimum and legally binding pay, terms and conditions for every employer and every worker in the sector. In practice it means that rather than the employer having all the power to determine what your conditions and pay are at work, they will be legally obliged to enter into negotiation with your trade union \u2013 a giant step forward in rebalancing the unequal power relations that exist between worker and employer. Imagine the transformative impact that would have on, say, the care sector, where the mostly female workforce has seen this highly skilled and professional area of work become a minimum wage job, where care workers are not paid for travel time between visits and can end up working 10 hours for five hours pay. What a scandalous state of affairs that the very people looking after some of the most poorly and vulnerable people in the country are being paid less than the minimum wage. And think of the effect on those in their care. Well, we are calling time on this kind of exploitative practice. Because under a Labour government, those care sector employers would be legally obliged to come to the table and negotiate all aspects of the industry, the conditions in workplaces and, fundamentally, their pay. So, whether you are a care home worker from Dundee or Durham, you would be secure in the knowledge that minimum terms and conditions negotiated for the sector will restore dignity and a decent life to you and those you look after. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, have arrived at No 10 for talks with Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson has secretly ordered the Cabinet Office to turn the government\u2019s public internet service into a platform for \u201ctargeted and personalised information\u201d to be gathered in the run-up to Brexit, BuzzFeed is reporting. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, was on the World at One. Like his boss, Arlene Foster (see 9.58am), he insisted that Boris Johnson would not sanction a Northern Ireland-only backstop. He explained: I don\u2019t see the prime minister who appointed himself as the minister for the union agreeing to an arrangement that separates Northern Ireland from Great Britain in trading terms. So, I think that this idea that you have a Northern Ireland-only backstop where you have a trade border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is simply a non-runner. In any event it would contravene the core principles of the Good Friday agreement, the Belfast agreement ... The solution to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland is not to create a second border in the Irish Sea because I think that would be deeply destabilising. He also rejected suggestions the DUP was losing influence over Number 10. He said: The idea that our influence is waning, I think, flies in the face of reality. Our leader will be meeting with Boris Johnson, we are plugged into the ongoing discussions about alternative arrangements, we have a significant role to play and, therefore, I would argue that our influence remains. Downing Street has denied wanting a Northern Ireland-only backstop. (See 1.55pm.) But there have been multiple claims that this is the direction in which Johnson is heading, including from the EU\u2019s new trade commissioner. (See 3.15pm.) Select committees cannot officially sit while parliament is prorogued. But, as Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee says on Twitter, her committee held an unofficial session this morning to take evidence on Brexit. Boris Johnson has recorded a short interview with Sky News on his visit to a primary school in Pimlico in London. Slipping into franglais (he was sitting in on a French lesson), he used the interview to dismiss claims that proroguing parliament for five weeks was anti-democratic. He said: We need a Queen\u2019s speech. That\u2019s why parliament is in recess now, because you always have a recess before a Queen\u2019s speech. And anybody who says - this stuff about it being anti-democratic - I mean, donnez-moi un break. What a load of nonsense. We were very, very clear that if people wanted a democratic moment, if they wanted an election, we offered it to the Labour opposition, and mysteriously they decided not to go for it. Johnson is right to say that parliament always gets prorogued before a Queen\u2019s speech, but the point about this prorogation is that it is lasting five weeks \u2013 far longer than normal. According to this House of Lords library briefing (pdf), it will be the longest prorogation since 1930. In his interview, Johnson also insisted that he was getting on with addressing the priorities of the people - which he said meant not just delivering Brexit by 31 October, but investing in the police and schools and hospitals. (See 1.22pm.) By contrast, he claimed, Labour was just offering delay and \u201cdither\u201d beyond 31 October. \u201cNobody can see what that achieves,\u201d he said. As John Bercow announced his decision to step down as Speaker on Monday afternoon, Britons in Spain were also contemplating their futures. In Barcelona, a group of them held a demo outside the British consulate to protest against the decision to suspend parliament and to complain about the \u201cenormous uncertainty\u201d they continue to face. Many had been excluded from the Brexit referendum because they had been resident abroad for more than 15 years and so were not entitled to vote. Phil Hogan, Ireland\u2019s European commissioner, has been given the trade portfolio under the new president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, it has been announced today. He has been commissioner for agriculture. This means he will be the EU chief trade negotiator, and will take the lead in negotiating the details of a trade deal with the UK after Brexit. If the UK had a choice (it didn\u2019t), Hogan might not be the candidate Boris Johnson would choose. He has been more critical of the UK\u2019s Brexit stance than other European commissioners, giving a speech last month describing Johnson as an \u201cunelected PM\u201d who was \u201cgambling with peace\u201d. As trade commissioner, Hogan is there to represent the EU, not Ireland. But if it ever gets to the point where the UK will be hoping for the EU to downplay Irish concerns in the negotiations, Hogan is not likely to be cooperative. But, on the plus side, Hogan is sounding more positive about the prospects of there being a Brexit deal than he was last month. In an interview with the Irish Times he said the penny was \u201cfinally dropping\u201d in the UK. I remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage \u2013 albeit at the eleventh hour \u2013 that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK. Asked if the two sides were heading in the direction of a Northern Ireland-only backstop, Hogan replied: Yes. The taoiseach has indicated in the last 24 hours that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is quite an interesting idea to revisit. Hogan also said Boris Johnson was shifting his stance. He explained: Mr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone. That is certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU and the rest of the UK. This is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. If we can build on that we certainly might get closer to one another in terms of a possible outcome. Hogan told the Irish Times that he would expect it to take \u201ca number of years\u201d to conclude a final trade deal with the EU. But he said that, because of the UK\u2019s long membership of the EU, the process should not take as long as normal trade deals. At the weekend there was speculation that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, might follow Amber Rudd in resigning from the cabinet. He is another remain-voting centrist thought to be suffering from extreme buyer\u2019s remorse following his decision to back Boris Johnson for leader. During the leadership campaign Hancock endorsed Johnson, only for Johnson to then criticise a plan for a sugar levy on milkshakes that Hancock was promoting. Then Johnson decided to prorogue parliament for five weeks - even though Hancock, during the leadership campaign, said such a move would dishonour everything people fought and died for at D-day. But, if anything, Hancock\u2019s enthusiasm for Johnson is growing. This morning after cabinet he put this on Twitter. Theresa May made sure her cricketing hero Geoffrey Boycott got a knighthood in her resignation honours list. This was controversial, because Boycott was convicted for assaulting his then girlfriend 21 years ago. Boycott did not do his case any good with the patronising and dismissive approach when asked about this by Martha Kearney on the Today programme this morning. My colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson has written it up here. Now Labour is saying Boycott should have his knighthood rescinded. This is from Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities. Celebrating a man convicted of assaulting his partner by giving him a knighthood is an insult to victims and survivors of domestic violence. Honouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister\u2019s favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is. Boris Johnson should rescind his knighthood today. The whole honours system needs radically overhauling, alongside peerages, so that our political system works for the many not the few. Here are some more lines from the Downing Street lobby briefing. I have already posted what the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said about today\u2019s cabinet meeting. (See 1.22pm.) The spokesman confirmed that the government intended to publish a revised version of the government\u2019s Operational Yellowhammer report about what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But he refused to say any more about how the government would respond to yesterday\u2019s Commons vote saying the government should publish all documents relating to Yellowhammer, as well as private messages from nine government aides relating to prorogation. He said the government would respond to the vote in due course. But he also said the request for private messages was disproportionate and unprecedented The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Johnson is considering a Northern Ireland-only backstop. (See 9.58am.) The spokesman said: \u201cWe are not seeking a Northern Ireland-only backstop.\u201d The spokesman confirmed that Johnson would not be attending a hearing with the liaison committee tomorrow. Sarah Wollaston, the committee\u2019s chair, thought she had an understanding with Johnson that he would appear on Wednesday and yesterday she wrote to him asking if that hearing could go ahead, regardless of prorogation (which means committees can no longer hold formal parliamentary hearings). But the spokesman said that Johnson would be offering an alternative debate. He said committees don\u2019t meet while parliament is prorogued. The spokesman suggested that Johnson would be holding more meetings with EU leaders soon. There are reports today saying the PM will go to Brussels next week. Asked about this, the spokesman said Johnson would be speaking with other EU leaders in the coming weeks and that his travel plans would be announced in the usual way (ie, nearer the time). He also said David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, would be in Brussels for talks with the EU\u2019s Brexit team tomorrow and on Friday. The spokesman said that a new minister for women and equalities would be appointed soon to replace Amber Rudd, who resigned at the weekend. Rudd has already been replaced in her capacity as work and pensions secretary by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey. The spokesman confirmed that Johnson would meet Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds, leader and deputy leader of the DUP, in Downing Street this afternoon. Today\u2019s cabinet sounds as if it was the first meeting of the committee drafting the next Conservative manifesto. Brexit was discussed. Boris Johnson briefed colleagues on his \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with Leo Varadkar yesterday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing. But the spokesman said there was also a substantial discussion on domestic policy, with ministers saying what their plans were for their own departments. Johnson\u2019s decision last week to remove the whip from 21 Tory rebels last week, effectively deselecting them as candidates at the next election, has been seen as sign that he is making the Conservative party increasingly extreme. In her letter announcing her resignation on Saturday night Amber Rudd said the removal of 21 one nation Tories was an \u201cact of political vandalism\u201d. The former party leader William Hague said in his Telegraph column today (see 10.25am) that this could prompt moderate Tories to start looking for a new home. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, made a similar argument in the Evening Standard yesterday. At cabinet Johnson pushed back against this claim. According to his spokesman, Johnson told the cabinet that he would lead a one nation government. The spokesman said: The prime minister then led a discussion on the government\u2019s priorities for the autumn. The PM said he would lead a one nation government which would respect the result of the referendum by leaving the European Union on October 31 while energetically focusing on the NHS, tackling violent crime, education and the cost of living. Secretaries of state then set out priorities for their individual departments. On crime and policing, the government will begin recruiting 20,000 new police officers and progress plans to invest up to \u00a32.5bn to deliver 10,000 new prison places. The government has also kicked off an urgent review of sentencing policy to ensure the public are protected from the most dangerous criminals. On education, a \u00a37.1bn increase in funding for schools by 2022-23 has been announced as the government focuses on giving all young people the same opportunities to succeed regardless of where they go to school. On health, as well as reaffirming the five-year settlement for the NHS, with an additional \u00a333.9bn a year by 2023-24, ministers will focus on ensuring this money gets to the front line and delivers real improvements for patients. The prime minister concluded the meeting by saying that the government would use education, infrastructure and technology to level up across the country. Number 10 sources are not contesting the Spectator report saying Johnson also described himself as \u201cthe most liberal Conservative PM in decades\u201d. (See 12.43pm.) Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, has said it would be wrong to use the general election to try to resolve the Brexit crisis. A referendum was needed for that, he argued, because an election should be fought on wider issues. Speaking at an event at King\u2019s College London, he said: It is wrong as a matter of principle to mix the general election up with the specific Brexit question. If the British people end up having a general election on Brexit you are going to mix up issues that should be kept separate. What Boris Johnson thinks is: if I fight a Brexit general election, I can say to people: \u2018Look it\u2019s no deal or you get Jeremy Corbyn.\u2019 You could end up with the bizarre situation where, let\u2019s just suppose the Conservatives manage to win a majority with 35% to 40% of the vote, they will claim a mandate for no-deal when, if you add the votes for all the parties opposed to no-deal together, they will come to more than 50% of the vote. It is a completely undemocratic way of deciding it. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing, much of which focused on what happened at cabinet. I\u2019ll post the highlights shortly, but you are better off reading James Forsyth\u2019s take in the Spectator, which is more interesting. Here\u2019s an excerpt. At the start of the meeting, Boris Johnson took on the argument made by many of the Tory 21 that this is an extreme government, and that he is turning the Tories into a rightwing sect. He argued that most voters want the referendum result delivered, which is what he is trying to do, and that his domestic agenda is in the common ground of British politics. He pointed out that he was more trusted on the NHS than Jeremy Corbyn, which would hardly be the case if the critics\u2019 charge was true. He told the cabinet that he was \u2018the most liberal Conservative PM in decades\u2019. At which point, Matt Hancock interjected: \u2018Don\u2019t tell Priti.\u2019 And here is another YouGov poll of some interest. I\u2019m off to the No 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. Here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech to the TUC. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s powerful de facto chief of staff, was doorstepped by Sky News as he left home this morning. Asked what his next move would be, Cummings replied: You guys should get out of London. Go and talk to people who are not rich remainers. This seems to be a reference to the idea that London-based journalists do not realise how much support there is for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy outside middle-class remain circles in the capital. There is quite a lot of evidence to support this view. Here is some YouGov polling from earlier this week suggesting that, among voters in general, people are inclined to think Boris Johnson and his government are more in touch with the public mood on Brexit than MPs in parliament are. But Lord Heseltine, the pro-European former Conservative deputy prime minister, said it was a mistake for Cummings to claim it was the remain side who represented the views of the wealthy elite. He told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics: If you start talking about who are the richest influential people in this campaign \u2013 who owns the Telegraph? Who owns the Sun? Who owns the Daily Mail? People with riches, wealth, of untold millions. They are the ones who appoint the editors of newspapers that are frankly propaganda sheets for leave. And for Dominic Cummings to try to shove the blame on to individuals who want to remain because they are rich is a major slip of the tongue. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. Amber Rudd, who quit as work and pensions secretary at the weekend, and also resigned the Tory whip, has written an open letter to her constituents explaining her decision. She now sits as an independent, but she says she hopes to continue as MP for Hastings and Rye \u201cinto the next general election\u201d. UPDATE: A spokesman for Amber Rudd has clarified that she will not stand in her Hastings and Rye constituency at the election. I have taken out the sentence in the paragraph above saying her letter seemed to imply otherwise. Boris Johnson chaired cabinet this morning. No 10 will brief on it at 12pm, but the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth has already had a read-out. Corbyn is on his peroration. Congress, the coming general election will be a chance for a real change of direction. In the next few weeks the establishment will come after us with all they\u2019ve got, because they know we\u2019re not afraid to take them on. We\u2019re going after the tax avoiders. We\u2019re going after the bad bosses. We\u2019re going after the dodgy landlords. We\u2019re going after the big polluters destroying our climate. Because we know whose side we\u2019re on. We\u2019re creating a society of hope and inclusion \u2013 not poverty \u2013 and division. He is now getting a long standing ovation. Corbyn has praise for the Financial Times. Last week the Financial Times said that Labour is, and I quote, \u2018determined to shift power away from bosses and landlords and to workers and tenants\u2019. Well there has been no shortage of rather unkind reporting about our party over the last few years, but this time they\u2019ve got it absolutely right. We will put workers on company boards, and give the workforce a 10% stake in large companies paying a dividend of as much as \u00a3500 a year to each employee. And we will give tenants more rights including caps on rent rises. And that principle of empowering people doesn\u2019t just apply to the workplace. We\u2019ll bring rail, mail, water and the national grid into public ownership, so the essential utilities that people rely on are run by and for the public, not just shareholders. Here is a story by my colleagues Kate Proctor and Rajeev Syal about the employment rights announcement in Corbyn\u2019s speech. Corbyn says Labour would set up a workers\u2019 protection agency. Too many employers are getting away with flouting laws. Nearly half a million people are still being paid less than the minimum wage. We\u2019ll put a stop to that. We\u2019ll create a workers protection agency with real teeth, including the power to enter workplaces and bring prosecutions on workers\u2019 behalf. If you\u2019re a worker with a boss who makes you work extra hours for no pay or forces you into dangerous situations, you deserve a government that\u2019s on your side and ready to step in to support you. Corbyn says Labour would introduce equal rights for all workers from day one. And it would end zero-hours contracts. Corbyn says Labour would bring about \u201cthe biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen\u201d. He says he would establish a new ministry of employment rights. He says Labour would roll out sectoral collective bargaining. And within 100 days of taking office he would repeal the Tory Trade Union Act. Corbyn says pay is lower in real terms than it was a decade ago, he says. He says the last decade has been the worst for wage growth since the Napoleonic war. Corbyn confirms that Labour will go into the election proposing a referendum on Brexit, with a credible leave option and remain as the two choices. Corbyn says his first priority is to stop no deal. Then he wants to trigger a general election. A general election is coming, he says. At the election he says Labour will unleash the biggest people-powered campaign ever seen. Corbyn says the Tories would use a no-deal Brexit to implement policies that would benefit the rich. For the Tories this is about so much more than leaving the European Union. It\u2019s about hijacking the referendum result to shift even more power and wealth to those at the top. They will use a no-deal crash to push through policies that benefit them and their super-rich supporters and hurt everyone else \u2013 just as they did after the financial crash. Under the cover of no-deal they will sell off our public services, strip away the regulations that keep us safe, and undermine workers\u2019 rights. He says a no-deal Brexit would be a Trump deal Brexit. Be in no doubt, a no-deal Brexit is really a Trump Deal Brexit, leading to a one-sided US trade deal negotiated from a position of weakness. It will put us at the mercy of Trump and the big US corporations itching to get their teeth further into our NHS, sound the death knell for our steel industry, and permanently drive down rights and protections for workers. I am not prepared to stand by and let that happen. Corbyn says this time last week the Tories and the DUP had a majority of one. Now it is minus 45, he says. He says for most people what happens at Westminster is a million miles away. For him, real politics is not the parliamentary knockabout. It is about giving power to people. He says Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy is clear. He says he wants to stage a showdown over no deal, and present this as a conflict between parliament and the people. But the idea that Johnson represents the people is absurd, he says. He says Johnson and his cabinet are not just on the side of the establishment. They are the establishment. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at the TUC conference now. He starts by praising the TUC, and thanking trade unionists for what they do. William Hague, the former Conservative leader and former foreign secretary, has used his Telegraph column today (paywall) to deliver a damning verdict on Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to remove the whip from the 21 rebels who voted against the government on Brexit last week. Many others have criticised the decision, of course, including Amber Rudd when she resigned as work and pensions secretary at the weekend, but given that Hague is someone whose default mode is loyalty to the party, his critique is remarkable. He describes what Johnson did as \u201ca disgusting act of hypocrisy\u201d. Here is an extract. All of us who have been Tory leader have made mistakes, but this one is the most egregious and counter-productive act of self-harm committed by the party leadership that I can recall in my lifetime. If we do not speak out about it, there is little prospect that lessons will be learned ... It is not possible to be aware of [the] record and characters [of those who have had the whip removed] without thinking that their expulsion from the parliamentary ranks of the Conservative party, partly at the behest of people who have spent years rebelling, is a disgusting act of hypocrisy. Space does not allow me to go through the work of each of these 21. But when I recall Nicholas Soames sitting assiduously on the backbenches and loyally supporting Tory leaders when I arrived in the Commons in 1989, and that he was still in the same spot, still supporting them, when I left in 2015, I cannot accept that he can be tossed out of the party after one rebellion on the whim of advisers who have only just turned up ... The final problem with this whole episode is that it appears to send a signal \u2013 that if you are a \u201cmoderate\u201d Tory, a socially liberal, fiscally responsible, internationalist Conservative who believes in the necessity of compromise and balance in our national affairs \u2013 you have to start to think about joining a new party. Job creation across the UK has slowed... but there\u2019s good news too \u2013 wages are picking up, my colleague Graeme Wearden writes on his business live blog, covering today\u2019s unemployment figures. The full details are here. Anyone who has followed Boris Johnson\u2019s career in detail will know that there is a long list of people who have put their trust in him and who at some point discover they have been let down. Are the DUP about to join the club? As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll wrote in a post on this blog yesterday, there is increasing speculation that Boris Johnson is moving towards accepting some version of a Northern Ireland-only backstop as a solution to the Brexit crisis. Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt went into this in more detail in a report yesterday. Here is an excerpt from a blog setting out his understanding of Johnson\u2019s thinking. The Tories familiar with Boris Johnson\u2019s thinking say he is now willing to contemplate a version of the so-called \u201cNorthern Ireland-only backstop\u201d. Under this plan Northern Ireland would be closely bound to the EU on areas where there are already elements of an all Ireland economy \u2013 agriculture and electricity. But Great Britain would be free to chart its own course. That would free GB to have a free trade agreement with the EU but would create a border down the Irish Sea. All of that could be achieved by amending the backstop in the Brexit withdrawal agreement to apply only to Northern Ireland. The separate political declaration would be amended to say that a Canada-plus trade deal would be negotiated for Great Britain. The government would be wary of calling the new mechanism a backstop, because it regards the current backstop as anti-democratic. Downing St confirmed that a backstop in any form is unacceptable to the prime minister. But he is willing to recognise, as he told MPs last week, that \u201cagri-food is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland\u201d. But there is potentially a big problem with this plan. The DUP would oppose anything that would create a new regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland (although Watt, in his blog, quotes one source explaining why a version of this proposal might be acceptable to the unionists). This morning Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, spoke to Sky News before flying to London. She said she would be speaking to Johnson later. Asked about the suggestions that Johnson was planning a Northern Ireland-only backstop, she claimed this was \u201cvery wide of the mark\u201d. Perhaps she is right, but it did sound a little as if she was not 100% convinced and as if she was seeking to lay down a marker to the PM. She told Sky News: There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about that ... What we\u2019re focused on is about getting a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom, one that works for Northern Ireland, one that does not have Northern Ireland hived off into a different customs union than the rest of the United Kingdom, breaking up the single market of the United Kingdom. That would be unheard off. To think that any United Kingdom prime minister would be involved in that sort of thing would just be an anathema. Jeremy Corbyn has said that in the past, our own prime minister has said that. So I think all of this speculation is very wide of the mark. When it was put to her that some people might think she was being naive, and that Johnson was more committed to delivering Brexit than to sticking with the DUP, she replied: What people are talking about is not delivering Brexit; what people are talking about is the break-up of the United Kingdom. That is not something that any prime minister in the United Kingdom is going to in any conscience go along with. Parliament is not sitting, but there is still plenty of politics around. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech at the launch of the King\u2019s College London International School for Government. 10am: A new group, MPs for a Deal, to give a briefing. Its members include Stephen Kinnock, Rory Stewart, Norman Lamb and Caroline Flint. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After cabinet Johnson is due to do a school visit to promote government plans to open more free schools. And Sky News is reporting that Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, is coming to London today. It is thought she will be meeting Johnson. I will post more on that shortly. Here is more from what Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, told the Today programme about how she would conduct herself if elected Commons Speaker. (See 8.27am.) She said: I think the Speaker has to be scrupulously neutral as between different views within the House. The Speaker doesn\u2019t vote, doesn\u2019t take sides in debates. But, the Speaker is not neutral as between parliament and the executive. The Speaker has to be on parliament\u2019s side and stand up for parliament. Asked about John Bercow\u2019s conduct as Speaker, Harman said: He has been right to say to ministers: \u2018You have got to come to the house. You have got to account for yourself.\u2019 John Bercow, who is effectively working his notice as Speaker now, delivered a short speech from the chair as the prorogation ceremony was beginning early this morning condemning the government\u2019s decision to prorogue for five weeks. Here is an extract from Hansard. I have already made the point that if people have the manners to listen, which they have not, that I will play my part. This is not, however, a normal prorogation. It is not typical. It is not standard. It is one of the longest for decades, and it represents, not just in the minds of many colleagues but for huge numbers of people outside an act of executive fiat. I quite understand. I have already said that I respect Black Rod, who is doing her duty. The Queen\u2019s Commissioners are doing their duty, and I will play my part. I completely understand. [Interruption.] It is not disorder. I do not require advice on order from you, Mr Stuart. You are a master of disorder, man. I completely understand why very large numbers of Members are much more comfortable staying where they are. Mr Stuart, if you do not like it, you are perfectly entitled to your view. I could not give a flying flamingo what your view is. [Interruption.] Thank you very much indeed. And here is some video. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Patrick Greenfield. If you are interested in all the chaos and protest that erupted in the Commons in the early hours of this morning as parliament was prorogued, here is our overnight story. But if you want all the details, including the best tweets and the most candid pictures, do have a look at yesterday\u2019s blog. My colleagues Mattha Busby and then Kate Lyons kept it going until 3.30am. It is a terrific read. The mother of the house, Harriet Harman, has told the BBC that she will stand for the position of Speaker after John Bercow announced he would stand down on October 31. Harman insists that she would be a neutral figure in the house despite her support for remaining in the European Union. Theresa May\u2019s former advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill have been included on her resignation honours list, provoking accusations of cronyism. They\u2019ll both get CBEs while Robbie Gibb, her director of communications, will received a knighthood. You can read the full list following the link below. Restoring power sharing in Stormont will surely be on the agenda in cabinet following a violent night in Derry on the Creggan estate. Police were attacked with petrol bombs and a device found in the city was an attempt to murder officers by the New IRA, according to the PSNI. Officers were carrying out searchings targeting dissident republicans. Yesterday, Boris Johnson and the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar clashed on the prospect of resorting direct rule in Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Taoiseach said his government would oppose direct rule from London as it would violate the Good Friday agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland. The prime minister will host a cabinet meeting later today and there is be plenty to discuss with just 51 days to go until Brexit. Former conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin has told BBC Radio 4 that Boris Johnson should turn his attention to reaching an agreement with the European Union. Letwin says he would vote for \u201cliterally any deal\u201d the government manages to agree with Brussels and he believes a large part of the house would also back an agreement. If he cannot get a majority to vote for the deal in the house, the prime minister should hold a referendum, Letwin adds. He also suggests that Johnson could back a second referendum, despite the fact that he opposes one now. Letwin explains: Boris has often changed his mind about many things. And that\u2019s one of his advantages, that he is very flexible. Boris Johnson suspended parliament amid chaotic scenes in the early hours of Tuesday following his sixth parliamentary defeat in six days, as MPs voted to block a snap election and to force the publication of No 10\u2019s secret preparations for a no-deal Brexit, writes our Rowena Mason. Welsh Labour MP Anna McMorrin had the tweet of the night from the house. Our data team have made a useful graphic that tells you which way your MP voted on calling a general election. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political goings-on. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest political developments this morning until Andrew Sparrow is ready to take charge. MPs met until the early hours on an another dramatic night in Westminster as parliament was suspended for five weeks at the request of Boris Johnson. The consternation of many MPs and the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, was clear, with the outgoing speaker describing the prorogation as \u201cnot typical\u201d, \u201cnot standard\u201d and as representing \u201can act of executive fiat\u201d. There were chaotic scenes in the house as Bercow began proceedings to prorogue parliament, as a group of opposition MPs carrying signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d drowned out Black Rod as she tried to address the Speaker, the ritual that initiates the suspension. Several MPs were also involved in altercation near the Speaker\u2019s chair, as they attempted to prevent him leaving his seat and attending the House of Lords, the next step in the formalities required for the suspension of parliament. Cries of \u201cshame on you\u201d rose from the opposition benches as government MPs left the chamber. Labour MPs, who remained in their seats after government MPs and the Speaker had left to attend the House of Lords, sang Jerusalem and Bread of Heaven. Parliament won\u2019t sit today, or for the next five weeks, but we\u2019re anticipating a lot of furious reaction. Join us as we bring you that and all of the day\u2019s other news.

We\u2019re seeing a more valuation-sensitive investor and it\u2019s having an impact on companies that lack profitability.\u201d</p> <p>MKM Partners\u2019 Rohit Kulkarni said in a note last month that investors would \u201chave to take a big leap of faith in order to believe that WeWork would show signs of a sustainable economic model\u201d given mounting losses and ambitious expansion to plans that could grow them further.</p> <p>WeWork reported that it has 527,000 members as of 30 June, an increase of more than 90% from the year before. That rapid expansion if reflected by a rapid increase in properties. WeWork has 528 locations, up from 485 at the end of the first quarter of 2019, and said it plans to open 169 new locations.</p> <p>But WeWork suffers from further complications, not least about its management. WeWork\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, has taken $700m out of the company ahead of its IPO, an unusual move for a founder. He also owns properties that WeWork rents, a potential conflict of interest.</p> <p>Neumann is also keen to expand WeWork beyond office rental. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.wework.com/blog/posts/wecompany\" title=\"\">blogpost</a> from Neumann, the company\u2019s new \u201cguiding mission will be to elevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d.</p> <p>That, he continued, \u201cmeans being a student of life, for life, where we accept that we are always growing and in a constant state of self-discovery, self-growth and change\u201d.</p> <p>Under the rebranding and expansion efforts, which largely focus on unpredictable growth in China, Neumann has also said he sees WeWork as a \u201cglobal platform\u201d for things like \u201cspace-as-a-service\u201d.</p> <p>For investors, who note that not a single woman <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/14/wework-doesnt-have-a-single-woman-director-according-to-ipo-filing.html\" title=\"\">will serve</a> on the company\u2019s seven-member board, investing in the company means having confidence in Neumann.</p> <p>Under a complicated share structure, Neumann controls the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/14/wework-ceo-adam-neumann-has-incentives-tied-to-stock-value-giving.html\" title=\"\">majority of the voting rights</a> through the company\u2019s class B and C shares. Neumann\u2019s holdings could increase under the IPO, and WeWork\u2019s leases include four buildings owned in part by him.</p> <p>Since founding WeWork nine years ago, Neumann has spent more than $80m buying at least five homes, as well as commercial properties and stakes in startups, including a medical cannabis company.</p> <p>According to corporate governance expert Charles Elson, the problems WeWork is having with its valuation and the prospect that it may be forced to shelve its IPO come down squarely to problems often reflected when a company offers a dual-class stock that in effect offers investors no accountability.</p> <p>\u201cThe common shareholders have basically no power \u2013 it\u2019s all concentrated in the founder,\u201d said Elson, director of the John L Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance and Edgar S Woolard Jr chair of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cGiven the conflict of interest transactions that took place there over the years, it\u2019s problematic. When you combine those actions with the dual-class structure, the concern is, could this happen again?</p>",

WeWork\u2019s IPO underwriters at JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are testing the appetite for a valuation between $15bn and $20bn \u2013 a substantial drop from the $47bn valuation SoftBank gave the company earlier this year. Their apparent hesitation, said Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities, speaks to a \u201cfork in the road\u201d in investor willingness to support profit-free tech companies. That concern, he said, is reflected in the weaker than expected investor demand for Uber and Lyft \u2013 both companies\u2019 valuation has fallen since their public listing. \u201cIt\u2019s about profitability and the nature of the business model,\u201d Ives said. \u201cThe math doesn\u2019t lie and investors are saying enough is enough with these valuations. We\u2019re seeing a more valuation-sensitive investor and it\u2019s having an impact on companies that lack profitability.\u201d MKM Partners\u2019 Rohit Kulkarni said in a note last month that investors would \u201chave to take a big leap of faith in order to believe that WeWork would show signs of a sustainable economic model\u201d given mounting losses and ambitious expansion to plans that could grow them further. WeWork reported that it has 527,000 members as of 30 June, an increase of more than 90% from the year before. That rapid expansion if reflected by a rapid increase in properties. WeWork has 528 locations, up from 485 at the end of the first quarter of 2019, and said it plans to open 169 new locations. But WeWork suffers from further complications, not least about its management. WeWork\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, has taken $700m out of the company ahead of its IPO, an unusual move for a founder. He also owns properties that WeWork rents, a potential conflict of interest. Neumann is also keen to expand WeWork beyond office rental. According to a recent blogpost from Neumann, the company\u2019s new \u201cguiding mission will be to elevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d. That, he continued, \u201cmeans being a student of life, for life, where we accept that we are always growing and in a constant state of self-discovery, self-growth and change\u201d. Under the rebranding and expansion efforts, which largely focus on unpredictable growth in China, Neumann has also said he sees WeWork as a \u201cglobal platform\u201d for things like \u201cspace-as-a-service\u201d. For investors, who note that not a single woman will serve on the company\u2019s seven-member board, investing in the company means having confidence in Neumann. Under a complicated share structure, Neumann controls the majority of the voting rights through the company\u2019s class B and C shares. Neumann\u2019s holdings could increase under the IPO, and WeWork\u2019s leases include four buildings owned in part by him. Since founding WeWork nine years ago, Neumann has spent more than $80m buying at least five homes, as well as commercial properties and stakes in startups, including a medical cannabis company. According to corporate governance expert Charles Elson, the problems WeWork is having with its valuation and the prospect that it may be forced to shelve its IPO come down squarely to problems often reflected when a company offers a dual-class stock that in effect offers investors no accountability. \u201cThe common shareholders have basically no power \u2013 it\u2019s all concentrated in the founder,\u201d said Elson, director of the John L Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance and Edgar S Woolard Jr chair of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cGiven the conflict of interest transactions that took place there over the years, it\u2019s problematic. When you combine those actions with the dual-class structure, the concern is, could this happen again?",

Yes.\u201d</p> <p>The conflict between rights and profits lies at the heart of a thought-provoking documentary, Push, which follows Farha\u2019s forays into the bleak depths of the global housing crisis, as she attempts to unpick exactly how we got here.

Sassen has spent her career analysing the invisible global flows between world cities. She is frank: \u201cThis is not at all about housing. The buildings function as assets.\u201d</p> <p>She places the blame firmly the finance industry, which \u201csells something it does not have\u201d, and which to do so \u201cneeds to invent brilliant instruments that allow it to invade other sectors\u201d \u2013 mechanisms that are sadly beyond the scope of the film to explain.

They encouraged foreclosures to clean up the books, gave the money to the hedge funds and private equity firms, who then bought the distressed assets to make money. It\u2019s the way the 2008 crisis has played an important role in increasing wealth inequality.\u201d</p> <p>Private equity firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/26/blackstone-group-accused-global-housing-crisis-un\">Blackstone</a> emerges as the chief villain of the piece, popping up in different guises around the world as the faceless Bond baddie lurking behind impenetrable walls of smoked glass. In the years after the financial crisis, Blackstone spent about $9.6bn (\u00a37.75bn), hoovering up thousands of properties across the US, and is accused of hiking rents and ruthlessly pursuing eviction for nonpayment.</p> <p>Blackstone was the company behind the acquisition of the Harlem project, while Farha also traces its tentacles to Sweden, where it is already the biggest private owner of low-income housing, having only entered the country in 2014. She visits a housing estate in Uppsala that the company is currently upgrading \u2013&#xa0;though Blackstone strongly deny the claim, made in the film, that they have raised rents by around 50% in the process. Sadly, a momentous meeting between Farha and Blackstone\u2019s head of real estate falls through, so the company\u2019s side of the story is absent. (Blackstone say that they spend billions renovating homes, that they are responsible property managers, and that tenants have a high level of satisfaction.)</p> <p>The iniquitous role of tax havens gets a look-in, too, elucidated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/roberto-saviano\">Roberto Saviano</a>, the Italian author of Gomorrah, the book-turned-TV-series that exposed the inner workings of the mafia. Now living under police protection and driven around in a bulletproof car, he explains how offshore companies work in the property money-laundering business. \u201cYou buy things with legal money \u2013 a restaurant, hotel or houses \u2013 then you sell those properties to your company in a tax haven. If you want to bring your dirty money back into your country, you simply buy it from yourself at a much higher price than you paid.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Q4So4femM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k9Q4So4femM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Push</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As a result, he says, \u201ccompanies don\u2019t want inexpensive real estate. They want to pay as much as possible, to be able to hide more money.\u201d With prices topping tens of millions for a townhouse, it won\u2019t surprise many that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/11/london-haven-dirty-cash-unexplained-wealth-orders-money-laundering\">London property has become the ultimate industrial laundry for the world\u2019s dodgy cash</a>.</p> <p>Just as you expect the documentary to reach a dazzling denouement, it rather fizzles out, concluding with a round-table meeting of mayors pledging to do a bit better. Nor is it ever explained what the UN\u2019s powers to enforce the right to housing might be, apart from Farha writing angry letters to the member states. The passionate special rapporteur is shown presenting her findings to a chamber of delegates, who fiddle with their phones as she details the catalogue of catastrophes.</p> <p>Governments must wake up. The transformation of cities into playgrounds for the rich, while homelessness continues to rise, is not an inevitability. It is the result of structural economic policies, which can be changed \u2013 if the will exists.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.architecturefoundation.org.uk/programme/2019/architecture-on-film-push\">Push premieres at the Barbican, London, on 11 September</a>, as part of the Architecture Foundation\u2019s Architecture on Film programme, followed by a Q&amp;A with director Fredrik Gertten</p>",

The UN\u2019s special rapporteur on adequate housing is on her way to visit a sprawling low-income housing project that was recently acquired by a private equity fund, leading to massive rent hikes and probable evictions. \u201cIs unbridled capitalism in an area that is a human right problematic? Yes.\u201d The conflict between rights and profits lies at the heart of a thought-provoking documentary, Push, which follows Farha\u2019s forays into the bleak depths of the global housing crisis, as she attempts to unpick exactly how we got here. In the Harlem estate she meets a man who already spends 90% of his income on his rent. Soon, his two-bedroom flat will cost $3,600 (\u00a3,2920) a month, and he will be forced to move. It is a story repeated from Toronto to Berlin, Stockholm and Seoul \u2013 via London\u2019s cleansed Heygate Estate and the remains of the Grenfell Tower \u2013 where Swedish director Fredrik Gertten accompanies Farha on a whirlwind tour of personal tragedy and corporate greed, as she unearths familiar tales of poor residents being forcibly evicted to make way for luxury investment units to be sold to wealthy overseas buyers. Her task is an unenviable one. On the one hand is a $217tn (\u00a3176tn) global property business, worth more than twice the world\u2019s total GDP. On the other is the human right to adequate housing, which is referred to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognised in international human rights law under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966. This law has been flagrantly breached by practically every UN member state ever since. In the middle, providing an engagingly human presence on camera, is Farha, the plucky 50-year-old lawyer and housing advocate from Ottawa. \u201cI\u2019m 5ft 2in, I\u2019m from this nowhere place, and I\u2019m trying to make a huge difference globally,\u201d she says, looking out of a window at blurred ranks of high-rise condos. \u201cI\u2019m trying to change an entire conversation that\u2019s embedded in the way people live all around the world.\u201d Along the way, providing sage guidance in her quest, are the voices of sociologist Saskia Sassen and economist Joseph Stiglitz, heavyweight academics who dispense bullets of wisdom. Sassen has spent her career analysing the invisible global flows between world cities. She is frank: \u201cThis is not at all about housing. The buildings function as assets.\u201d She places the blame firmly the finance industry, which \u201csells something it does not have\u201d, and which to do so \u201cneeds to invent brilliant instruments that allow it to invade other sectors\u201d \u2013 mechanisms that are sadly beyond the scope of the film to explain. (It could have done with a few rapid-fire explainers, in the style of The Big Short). Sassen compares the financial industry to mining: \u201cOnce it has extracted what it needs [from housing], it doesn\u2019t care what happens to the rest.\u201d The Nobel laureate Stiglitz illuminates exactly how the world of private equity invaded property thanks to the 2008 financial crisis, in a process that was facilitated by the US government. \u201cRather than helping the homeowners who were losing their homes, [the government] sided with the banks. They encouraged foreclosures to clean up the books, gave the money to the hedge funds and private equity firms, who then bought the distressed assets to make money. It\u2019s the way the 2008 crisis has played an important role in increasing wealth inequality.\u201d Private equity firm Blackstone emerges as the chief villain of the piece, popping up in different guises around the world as the faceless Bond baddie lurking behind impenetrable walls of smoked glass. In the years after the financial crisis, Blackstone spent about $9.6bn (\u00a37.75bn), hoovering up thousands of properties across the US, and is accused of hiking rents and ruthlessly pursuing eviction for nonpayment. Blackstone was the company behind the acquisition of the Harlem project, while Farha also traces its tentacles to Sweden, where it is already the biggest private owner of low-income housing, having only entered the country in 2014. She visits a housing estate in Uppsala that the company is currently upgrading \u2013 though Blackstone strongly deny the claim, made in the film, that they have raised rents by around 50% in the process. Sadly, a momentous meeting between Farha and Blackstone\u2019s head of real estate falls through, so the company\u2019s side of the story is absent. (Blackstone say that they spend billions renovating homes, that they are responsible property managers, and that tenants have a high level of satisfaction.) The iniquitous role of tax havens gets a look-in, too, elucidated by Roberto Saviano, the Italian author of Gomorrah, the book-turned-TV-series that exposed the inner workings of the mafia. Now living under police protection and driven around in a bulletproof car, he explains how offshore companies work in the property money-laundering business. \u201cYou buy things with legal money \u2013 a restaurant, hotel or houses \u2013 then you sell those properties to your company in a tax haven. If you want to bring your dirty money back into your country, you simply buy it from yourself at a much higher price than you paid.\u201d As a result, he says, \u201ccompanies don\u2019t want inexpensive real estate. They want to pay as much as possible, to be able to hide more money.\u201d With prices topping tens of millions for a townhouse, it won\u2019t surprise many that London property has become the ultimate industrial laundry for the world\u2019s dodgy cash. Just as you expect the documentary to reach a dazzling denouement, it rather fizzles out, concluding with a round-table meeting of mayors pledging to do a bit better. Nor is it ever explained what the UN\u2019s powers to enforce the right to housing might be, apart from Farha writing angry letters to the member states. The passionate special rapporteur is shown presenting her findings to a chamber of delegates, who fiddle with their phones as she details the catalogue of catastrophes. Governments must wake up. The transformation of cities into playgrounds for the rich, while homelessness continues to rise, is not an inevitability. It is the result of structural economic policies, which can be changed \u2013 if the will exists. \u2022 Push premieres at the Barbican, London, on 11 September, as part of the Architecture Foundation\u2019s Architecture on Film programme, followed by a Q&amp;A with director Fredrik Gertten",

He continued exhibiting and curated a major retrospective of his work, entitled Moving Out, for the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1994. Tate Modern in London held the first major UK exhibition of Frank\u2019s work in 2004. The 50th anniversary of the publication of The Americans was celebrated with a new edition in 2008, for which Frank reframed and cropped many of the images. \u2022 Robert Louis Frank, photographer and film-maker, born 9 November 1924; died 9 September 2019",

It wasn\u2019t them who would be harmed by a no-deal Brexit, it was the people whose jobs and rights would be under threat.</p> <p>Labour would promise a second referendum with a negotiated deal and remain on the ballot paper. Corbyn just couldn\u2019t say which side he would support. Partly because he was knackered, but mainly because he didn\u2019t know. The race is now firmly on to make sure you aren\u2019t the party perceived to be on the side of the establishment.</p> <p>In an interview later in the day, Johnson begged for everyone to \u201c<em>Donnez-moi un break</em>\u201d while insisting democracy was best served by doing away with democracy. The country replied with a loud \u201c<em>Fermez le fuck up</em>\u201d.

With Boris we have Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s parliament. Most of us now also long to both exist and not exist. Preferably the latter. Where are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/theresa-may-brexit-speech-brussels-eu-pot-plants-sketch\">four pot plants</a> when you need them?</p> <p>Back in London, Westminster resembled a ghost town. All the pro- and anti-Brexit protesters had melted away and traffic around Parliament Square was flowing freely for the first time in months. But in committee room 16, Yvette Cooper and a handful of opposition MPs were mounting their own guerrilla government by holding an unofficial session of the home affairs select committee.</p> <p>The resistance started here. And almost certainly ended here, as the proceedings weren\u2019t televised. So the evidence of Pauline Bastidon, the head of European policy for the Freight Transport Authority, that the government\u2019s Brexit preparations were still largely a mystery to her went almost entirely unnoticed. Just as the Tories had hoped. Government at an almost total standstill.</p> <p>So little was going on \u2013 remember Donald Tusk pleading with the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/may-agrees-to-october-brexit-after-franco-german-carve-up\">not to waste</a> this time? \u2013 that the only other highlight of the day was a brief cameo from Dominic Cummings, who was doorstepped outside his home. How was he planning to spend the next five weeks? Not talking to rich remainers in London. Said the rich Brexiter whose family has taken \u00a3250,000 off the EU in farming subsidies.

He did, though, try to reset the dial by making it clear that although he was happy to be considered more mainstream these days, the real establishment elite were the Brexiters who were claiming to be anti-establishment. It wasn\u2019t them who would be harmed by a no-deal Brexit, it was the people whose jobs and rights would be under threat. Labour would promise a second referendum with a negotiated deal and remain on the ballot paper. Corbyn just couldn\u2019t say which side he would support. Partly because he was knackered, but mainly because he didn\u2019t know. The race is now firmly on to make sure you aren\u2019t the party perceived to be on the side of the establishment. In an interview later in the day, Johnson begged for everyone to \u201cDonnez-moi un break\u201d while insisting democracy was best served by doing away with democracy. The country replied with a loud \u201cFermez le fuck up\u201d. With May we had Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Brexit. With Boris we have Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s parliament. Most of us now also long to both exist and not exist. Preferably the latter. Where are the four pot plants when you need them? Back in London, Westminster resembled a ghost town. All the pro- and anti-Brexit protesters had melted away and traffic around Parliament Square was flowing freely for the first time in months. But in committee room 16, Yvette Cooper and a handful of opposition MPs were mounting their own guerrilla government by holding an unofficial session of the home affairs select committee. The resistance started here. And almost certainly ended here, as the proceedings weren\u2019t televised. So the evidence of Pauline Bastidon, the head of European policy for the Freight Transport Authority, that the government\u2019s Brexit preparations were still largely a mystery to her went almost entirely unnoticed. Just as the Tories had hoped. Government at an almost total standstill. So little was going on \u2013 remember Donald Tusk pleading with the UK not to waste this time? \u2013 that the only other highlight of the day was a brief cameo from Dominic Cummings, who was doorstepped outside his home. How was he planning to spend the next five weeks? Not talking to rich remainers in London. Said the rich Brexiter whose family has taken \u00a3250,000 off the EU in farming subsidies. Classic Dom.",

It\u2019s also exactly the kind of thing French Fleabag would say. What Cottin delivers, though, is by no means a tribute act to Waller-Bridge. To call her elegant would be insufficient.

      "bodyText": "Britain has accused Iran of breaching assurances that it would not sell oil to Syria from an Iranian tanker released by authorities in Gibraltar on the condition that the 2.1m barrels it was carrying would not be sold to the \u201cmurderous regime\u201d of Bashar al-Assad. Tehran acknowledged at the weekend that the oil had been sold and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination, after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria. Iran, desperate for revenue from oil exports, did not formally confirm the customer was Syria. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, summoned Hamid Baeidinejad, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, to a meeting on Wednesday to ask why the assurances given to the Gibraltarian authorities had not been honoured. British officials are relatively certain from intelligence assessments that the oil was offloaded on to smaller boats. British marines seized Grace 1 in July after it entered Gibraltarian waters, claiming the oil was destined for Assad and Syria in breach of EU economic sanctions. The Foreign Office says Iranian officials gave as many as five different assurances to British officials \u2013 including one in writing to Gibraltar\u2019s government \u2013 that the ship\u2019s cargo would not go to Syria. \u201cIran repeatedly gave assurances to the government of Gibraltar that the Grace 1/Adrian Darya 1 would not deliver oil to any EU-sanctioned entity in Syria or elsewhere. It is now clear that Iran has breached these assurances and that the oil has been transferred to Syria and Assad\u2019s murderous regime,\u201d the Foreign Office said in a statement. \u201cIran\u2019s actions represent an unacceptable violation of international norms and the UK will raise the issue at the United Nations later this month.\u201d Raab said: \u201cIran has shown complete disregard for its own assurances over Adrian Darya 1. This sale of oil to Assad\u2019s brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the government of Iran designed to disrupt regional security. \u201cThis includes illegally supplying weapons to Houthi insurgents in Yemen, support for Hezbollah terrorists and most recently its attempts to hijack commercial ships passing through the Gulf. \u201cWe want Iran to come in from the cold, but the only way to do that is to keep its word and comply with the rules-based international system.\u201d The UK insisted the tanker was seized only in pursuit of EU sanctions policy, and not in support of the US effort to cut off Iranian oil exports, a strategy with which the UK does not agree. Britain is pursuing a policy of maximum economic pressure on Iran in an attempt to force Tehran to renegotiate the joint comprehensive plan of action, a deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme signed in 2015. Iran has argued it was not a party to the EU sanctions against Damascus, but also said the oil was not destined for Syria. Subsequently, following negotiations both in the Foreign Office in London and in Gibraltar, the British claimed assurances had been given that the oil would not be sold to Syria. The US attempted to block the departure of the ship from Gibraltar, and US officials then tried to contact the captain of the ship to offer him a substantial sum in return for not selling the oil to Syria but instead taking the ship to a port at which the US could seize the cargo. The Gibraltar first minister, Fabian Picardo, said in a statement: \u201cIt will be a massive volte face for Iran to have failed to live up to its written undertaking in the full glare of international public opinion. \u201cThey will really make themselves look shifty and unreliable if they have acted contrary to their repeated assertions and undertakings.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Theresa May first began to recruit staff for No 10, she made one thing very clear. Anyone joining government in the new, ostentatiously workmanlike, post-Cameron era shouldn\u2019t be doing so hoping to get a gong out of it: they would, the new prime minister is said to have warned, be lucky to get \u201cso much as a chocolate biscuit\u201d at the end. The sentiment encapsulated everything that was meant to have changed since the old Etonian set cleared their desks \u2013 so much so that she eventually wheeled it out in public. At an awards dinner <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/11/theresa-may-turns-sir-craig/\" title=\"\">she joked</a> that David Cameron\u2019s former spin doctor, Craig Oliver, had confessed to retching into a bin when he heard the referendum result; when he became Sir Craig, everyone else knew the feeling.</p> <p>For many, the most sickening aspect of May\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/theresa-may-accused-of-cronyism-over-resignation-honours\" title=\"\">resignation honours list</a> will be the sight of a woman praised for her work on domestic violence giving a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/cricketers-boycott-and-strauss-knighted-in-mays-resignation-honours\" title=\"\">knighthood to a cricketer</a> convicted of it. But the political honours she dished out are, in their own way, just as capable of undermining any remaining legacy. Worse still, they fuel the corrosive belief that all politicians are the same; that even those who promise to be different eventually revert to type. Who imagines Boris Johnson will be any more immune to the temptation of abusing the honours system, given recent threats to stuff the Lords with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/27/boris-johnson-house-lords-brexit-heroes-civil-service\" title=\"\">pro-Brexit peers</a>?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was David Cameron who cranked up the patronage machine again, bumping several trusted acolytes up to the Lords and sprinkling MBEs and CBEs around with abandon</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For some, it will be the lead Brexit negotiator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/27/olly-robbins-steely-operator-fighting-on-the-brexit-frontline\" title=\"\">Olly Robbins</a>\u2019 knighthood \u2013 announced just as it emerges that he is leaving government for Goldman Sachs \u2013 that sticks in the craw. But Robbins is arguably one of the more deserving recipients on the list, insofar as anyone can ever be said to deserve a celebratory trip to the palace or the right to sit in unelected, lifelong judgment from the House of Lords. He is a distinguished civil servant who did his best to carry out the impossible mandate imposed on him, under a blizzard of vicious briefing by Brexiters who knew he could not publicly answer back.</p> <p>You could even make a case for the former Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell going to the Lords, on the grounds that few know more about the last desperate stages of the Brexit negotiations from the inside. He has both the desire for consensus on which the upper house thrives, and insights into the behaviour of cabinet ministers which should now be shared for the public good.</p> <p>But there can be precious little excuse for doling out a CBE to his predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/23/nick-timothy-commonwealth-games-birmingham-2022-theresa-may\" title=\"\">Nick Timothy</a>, a man failing upwards in the most spectacular way possible: forced to resign after masterminding an election strategy and a manifesto that cost his government its majority in 2017, he spent the next two years pouring scorn on successors\u2019 efforts via a Daily Telegraph column. It\u2019s also hard to discern what her spin doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/06/robbie-gibb-no-10s-fair-flexible-and-very-modern-new-spin-doctor\" title=\"\">Robbie Gibb</a> did to deserve his knighthood, either, beyond stick with it through the most miserable of times.

      "bodyText": "When Theresa May first began to recruit staff for No 10, she made one thing very clear. Anyone joining government in the new, ostentatiously workmanlike, post-Cameron era shouldn\u2019t be doing so hoping to get a gong out of it: they would, the new prime minister is said to have warned, be lucky to get \u201cso much as a chocolate biscuit\u201d at the end. The sentiment encapsulated everything that was meant to have changed since the old Etonian set cleared their desks \u2013 so much so that she eventually wheeled it out in public. At an awards dinner she joked that David Cameron\u2019s former spin doctor, Craig Oliver, had confessed to retching into a bin when he heard the referendum result; when he became Sir Craig, everyone else knew the feeling. For many, the most sickening aspect of May\u2019s own resignation honours list will be the sight of a woman praised for her work on domestic violence giving a knighthood to a cricketer convicted of it. But the political honours she dished out are, in their own way, just as capable of undermining any remaining legacy. Worse still, they fuel the corrosive belief that all politicians are the same; that even those who promise to be different eventually revert to type. Who imagines Boris Johnson will be any more immune to the temptation of abusing the honours system, given recent threats to stuff the Lords with pro-Brexit peers? For some, it will be the lead Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins\u2019 knighthood \u2013 announced just as it emerges that he is leaving government for Goldman Sachs \u2013 that sticks in the craw. But Robbins is arguably one of the more deserving recipients on the list, insofar as anyone can ever be said to deserve a celebratory trip to the palace or the right to sit in unelected, lifelong judgment from the House of Lords. He is a distinguished civil servant who did his best to carry out the impossible mandate imposed on him, under a blizzard of vicious briefing by Brexiters who knew he could not publicly answer back. You could even make a case for the former Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell going to the Lords, on the grounds that few know more about the last desperate stages of the Brexit negotiations from the inside. He has both the desire for consensus on which the upper house thrives, and insights into the behaviour of cabinet ministers which should now be shared for the public good. But there can be precious little excuse for doling out a CBE to his predecessor, Nick Timothy, a man failing upwards in the most spectacular way possible: forced to resign after masterminding an election strategy and a manifesto that cost his government its majority in 2017, he spent the next two years pouring scorn on successors\u2019 efforts via a Daily Telegraph column. It\u2019s also hard to discern what her spin doctor Robbie Gibb did to deserve his knighthood, either, beyond stick with it through the most miserable of times. Does that qualify as serving his country with unprecedented distinction \u2013 the accepted criterion for honours \u2013 or merely serving his prime minister? The two have always been wrongly conflated in honours lists, but rarely so excruciatingly as in the last few years. Tony Blair, presumably sensing how it would go down following the so-called cash-for-peerages scandal, which questioned whether some Labour party donors were wearing ermine for all the wrong reasons, didn\u2019t have a resignation honours list. Gordon Brown went for a muted dissolution honours list but it was Cameron who cranked up the patronage machine again, bumping several trusted acolytes up to the Lords and sprinkling MBEs and CBEs around with abandon. Cameron did so having waved aside recommendations to reform the honours system \u2013 and calls for MPs to have the power of veto over it. Had the Commons been given the chance to run an eye over May\u2019s list, it is hard to tell who would have objected loudest: opposition MPs, or Tories who blame Timothy for costing them a majority, Barwell for holding out against a hard Brexit and Robbins for failing to deliver the promised unicorns. When there is this little agreement on what constitutes public service, or even on which voters\u2019 interests should rightly be served, then the entire idea of honours becomes nonsense. Outrage is priced into the system now \u2013 the backlash against honorary baubles so routine that Westminster is virtually numb to it. But taken together with a wider collapse of confidence in the parliamentary and democratic process, this time the rot goes even deeper. May has diminished herself with an honours list that goes against so much of what she always said she stood for. But she has also diminished the reputation of a political system that has dangerously little credibility left to lose. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese government has expressed its anger with Germany\u2019s foreign minister over his meeting with the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, saying the encounter was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d of Beijing\u2019s sovereignty. Wong tweeted a picture of himself and Heiko Maas following his arrival in Berlin, saying the two had discussed the \u201cprotest situation and our cause\u201d. The 22-year-old, arrested in August for his role in the protests which have challenged Beijing, was feted by German politicians and media commentators at a party in the rooftop restaurant of the Reichstag building on Monday night hosted by the Bild tabloid. Speaking to the gathering, Wong pledged to continue to \u201cprotest until the day that we have free elections\u201d and compared Hong Kong with communist East Germany during the pro-democracy protests that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. \u201cIf we are now in a new cold war, Hong Kong is the new Berlin,\u201d Wong told the gathering. \u201cWe urge the free world to stand together with us in resisting the autocratic Chinese regime.\u201d He had been briefly detained in Hong Kong by authorities immediately before his departure to Germany, apparently following a mistake related to his bail conditions. The former student leader of pro-democracy protests in 2014 was one of several activists arrested in late August. The case was adjourned until November and he was released on HK$10,000 (\u00a31,045) bail. Wong told the Berlin gathering he had been arrested eight times and held in detention for 100 days. In a statement a spokeswoman for China\u2019s foreign ministry accused Berlin of interfering in the country\u2019s affairs. \u201cIt is extremely wrong for German media and politicians to attempt to tap into the anti-China separatist wave,\u201d Hua Chunying said at a press briefing on Tuesday, adding that the government \u201cstrongly disapproved\u201d of the meeting. \u201cIt is disrespectful towards China\u2019s sovereignty and an interference in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign ministry rejected the criticism. A spokesman said it was normal for the foreign minister to \u201chold meetings with members of civil society and for the government to stand up for freedom of speech\u201d. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who visited Beijing last week with an entourage of business leaders, said she had discussed the protests during her meetings with officials. She reportedly stressed to China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, on Friday that the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong \u201cmust be guaranteed\u201d. Wong, who is due to address students and the public on Wednesday evening at the Humboldt University in Berlin before travelling to the US, said he planned to hold further talks with political leaders in Germany. There was no meeting scheduled with Merkel, according to her spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Last week, Wong made headlines in Germany after calling for two panda cubs, born last month to pandas at Berlin zoo who have been rented from the Chinese government, to be named \u201cDemocracy\u201d and \u201cFreedom\u201d, in order to \u201csend a very clear signal to China\u201d. A national campaign has called for the cubs to be called \u201cHong\u201d and \u201cKong\u201d.",

The fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), is concerned about the number of clinics still offering procedures such as endometrial scratching and assisted egg hatching. It found that the proportion offering such treatments had risen slightly last year to 86%, despite a publicity campaign warning patients there is little scientific evidence the techniques can boost the chance of having a baby. On Wednesday the HFEA\u2019s board will be asked to approve measures including forcing clinics to itemise the cost of such treatments and encouraging clinic staff to blow the whistle against bad practice. A paper prepared for the board points out that the HFEA has no powers to stop clinics offering questionable treatments, but the board is asked to consider how patients can actively give consent to having an add-on treatment. It said it wanted to \u201cstop patients being misled (in terms of potentially exploiting unfounded expectations) by ensuring, through inspections and our own published information, that patients are provided with information that is clear and reliable.\u201d The HFEA has already introduced a traffic light system warning of a lack of clinical evidence about 11 add-on procedures that are typically offered by IVF clinics.

Narrow your eyes, squint real hard, suspend disbelief, have some more of your magic whisky, and you could almost convince yourself that we\u2019re still roaming the magic lands of the much more entertaining Premier League, a place of pure imagination where Daniel James keeps curling them in from distance, Teemu Pukki scores futile goals in lost causes, and Watford sack their manager every 18 minutes. Also Scotland keep losing heavily at home, which is nothing to do with our bread-and-butter reverie, but it is another repetitive thing that happens quite a lot in life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/09/scotland-belgium-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">Toothless Scotland crumble in face of Belgium\u2019s superior attacking class</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oh Scotland.

But while The Fiver is open-minded enough to explore alternatives to beloved confectionary staples, Steve Clarke insists he\u2019s \u201cnot going to experiment\u201d, news which may cause mild concern among a long-suffering support who, at this rate, can\u2019t be far off reassessing Berti Vogts in a more favourable light.</p> <p>\u201cI have to make us better defensively, more resilient,\u201d announced Clarke. But it wasn\u2019t all pipe dreams. \u201cThe group is over in terms of qualification, and what we have do now is target third position.\u201d Third position! Say what you like about 1978, but at least Ally MacLeod was reaching for the stars. Having said that, it\u2019s probably best to be a tad more realistic right now, given the Scots are currently trailing both Kazakhstan and Cyprus after six games of Group I, with only San Marino propping them up. A strong finish would at least generate some much-needed confidence going into the Nations League play-offs, so the theory goes. And so hopes of grabbing one of those 128 qualification spots available for Euro 2020 aren\u2019t quite dashed, at least not yet.

I\u2019m possibly the only one that stood up to him, more than once. I think that\u2019s what bothers him most maybe. I really don\u2019t know why people pay attention. Because, yes, he was a good player \u2013 an unbelievable player \u2013 known as a hard man on the pitch. But there\u2019s a difference between being a hard man on the pitch and being a tough guy. Just because someone has a sharp tongue or a stare, doesn\u2019t make them a tough guy. My brother-in-law was a marine commando, went to war, he\u2019s a tough guy.

One pitch required you to step carefully as the pitch had been laid over chicken wire \u2013 now laid bare by years of neglect. Another ground had uncut grass as tall as we were all around it, and if balls played out of touch weren\u2019t hard enough to find in the first place, the search was made even more difficult by the used needles we had to take care to avoid. Still, these memories do trigger a genuine sense of nostalgia \u2013 kids these days will never know what they are missing\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman.</p> <p>\u201cWe would have given our right arm, and frequently gave the ligaments of our right (and left) legs, to have played on a pitch with mere oak trees and manhole covers, while we battled it out on the frozen wastelands of Dunsink Lane (think poor man\u2019s Hackney Marshes) in the Leinster Senior League in the 1980s. Unfortunately, before the wastelands were frozen, they had been galloped on by rather large horses leaving 12-inch deep hoof prints all over the hallowed turf, which subsequently froze rock hard in November, December and January, leaving us to play Russian roulette with the randomly positioned death trap holes and the clogger fullbacks of the LSL.

      "bodyText": "OH SCOTLAND (ptXXXVII of an ongoing series) Nobody likes the international break, do they, we\u2019ve established that. But this current one hasn\u2019t been so bad, has it? Narrow your eyes, squint real hard, suspend disbelief, have some more of your magic whisky, and you could almost convince yourself that we\u2019re still roaming the magic lands of the much more entertaining Premier League, a place of pure imagination where Daniel James keeps curling them in from distance, Teemu Pukki scores futile goals in lost causes, and Watford sack their manager every 18 minutes. Also Scotland keep losing heavily at home, which is nothing to do with our bread-and-butter reverie, but it is another repetitive thing that happens quite a lot in life. Oh Scotland. Their latest Hampden humiliation, a 4-0 skelping at the hands of a team told what to do by Bobby M, comes four days after they crumbled like an own-brand version of a caramel wafer against Russia. But while The Fiver is open-minded enough to explore alternatives to beloved confectionary staples, Steve Clarke insists he\u2019s \u201cnot going to experiment\u201d, news which may cause mild concern among a long-suffering support who, at this rate, can\u2019t be far off reassessing Berti Vogts in a more favourable light. \u201cI have to make us better defensively, more resilient,\u201d announced Clarke. But it wasn\u2019t all pipe dreams. \u201cThe group is over in terms of qualification, and what we have do now is target third position.\u201d Third position! Say what you like about 1978, but at least Ally MacLeod was reaching for the stars. Having said that, it\u2019s probably best to be a tad more realistic right now, given the Scots are currently trailing both Kazakhstan and Cyprus after six games of Group I, with only San Marino propping them up. A strong finish would at least generate some much-needed confidence going into the Nations League play-offs, so the theory goes. And so hopes of grabbing one of those 128 qualification spots available for Euro 2020 aren\u2019t quite dashed, at least not yet. Incidentally, the extra pennies for the Tunnock\u2019s original is money well spent. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray for hot MBM coverage of England 2-1 Kosovo from 7.45pm BST. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing about the man \u2013 he doesn\u2019t get to me one bit. I\u2019m possibly the only one that stood up to him, more than once. I think that\u2019s what bothers him most maybe. I really don\u2019t know why people pay attention. Because, yes, he was a good player \u2013 an unbelievable player \u2013 known as a hard man on the pitch. But there\u2019s a difference between being a hard man on the pitch and being a tough guy. Just because someone has a sharp tongue or a stare, doesn\u2019t make them a tough guy. My brother-in-law was a marine commando, went to war, he\u2019s a tough guy. They\u2019re the people you say are tough guys, not Roy. So that\u2019s why I was never scared as a player\u201d \u2013 Jon Walters offers up a choice response to Roy Keane flapping his gums last week. RECOMMENDED LOOKING David Squires on \u2026 England, Scotland and Owen v Shearer. Get your own here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cJordan Glossop on terrible pitches (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) reminds me of some of my own fond memories from youth leagues in New York City. One pitch required you to step carefully as the pitch had been laid over chicken wire \u2013 now laid bare by years of neglect. Another ground had uncut grass as tall as we were all around it, and if balls played out of touch weren\u2019t hard enough to find in the first place, the search was made even more difficult by the used needles we had to take care to avoid. Still, these memories do trigger a genuine sense of nostalgia \u2013 kids these days will never know what they are missing\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman. \u201cWe would have given our right arm, and frequently gave the ligaments of our right (and left) legs, to have played on a pitch with mere oak trees and manhole covers, while we battled it out on the frozen wastelands of Dunsink Lane (think poor man\u2019s Hackney Marshes) in the Leinster Senior League in the 1980s. Unfortunately, before the wastelands were frozen, they had been galloped on by rather large horses leaving 12-inch deep hoof prints all over the hallowed turf, which subsequently froze rock hard in November, December and January, leaving us to play Russian roulette with the randomly positioned death trap holes and the clogger fullbacks of the LSL. Happy days\u201d \u2013 Dexter O\u2019Riordan. \u201cTo offset the seemingly endless tedium of international weeks, I\u2019ve been catching up on Danny Baker\u2019s BBC London Afternoon Retreat shows from 2005 that someone now seems to be uploading as podcasts for some reason. They are clearly great but are quite a disorientating listen. Max Rushden is the newsreader, the first story on the news is about the government \u2018nearly\u2019 losing a vote and in the sports news, Arsenal are going well in Big Cup. A different world \u2026\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of John Nicholson\u2019s new book Can We Have Our Ball Back? is \u2026 Dexter O\u2019Riordan. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Iranian fan Sahar Khodayari has died a week after setting herself on fire outside a courtroom, after learning she may face six months in prison for trying to enter a stadium. England boss Gareth Southgate has offered support to Declan Rice after the midfielder and his family received online threats following his switch in allegiance. \u201cI\u2019ve had people saying they\u2019re going to come to my house,\u201d said Rice. \u201cThere\u2019s a few bits I could go into but I don\u2019t need to go into it, threats to my family, threats to me. It was tough, there has been some abuse.\u201d French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet doesn\u2019t want referees to interrupt matches in case of homophobic chants, despite new rules introduced by the FFF this season that permit such interruptions. \u201cI would not stop the games \u2013 totally against this,\u201d he belched. \u201cWe will make sure there are no more [homophobic banners and chants]. But stopping a game? No.\u201d And Danny Cowley is eyeing up the Premier League after parlaying his impressive managerial ascent alongside brother Nicky into jobs at Huddersfield. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fairytale,\u201d he tooted. \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding place from that. We started in the Essex Senior League. You have to believe in football miracles and they have happened here once before in recent history.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? Suzanne Wrack looks at the lessons to be learned from hosting WSL games in big grounds. Nick Ames on the promise and the passion of the Kosovo team facing England. Talking of which, Andy Hunter mulls over England and the balance between blooding young players and securing results. The match takes place at St Mary\u2019s, which is just as well because watching England at Wembley is rubbish, reckons Sachin Nakrani. Louise Taylor wonders whether football is too self-important to care about the climate crisis. The standout young players in League One and League Two so far. Is MLS full of attacking talent, wonders Graham Ruthven, or are is the defending just bobbins? Not football, but read.

Tafida Raqeeb, from Newham in east London, is on life support at Royal London hospital after sustaining a brain injury in February. Doctors at the hospital have said she has no awareness and, with no prospect of recovery, life support should be withdrawn. Barts NHS trust, which runs the hospital, has applied to the high court to withdraw treatment, but Tafida\u2019s parents simultaneously took the unusual approach of bringing a judicial review against Barts\u2019 decision not to permit her to travel to Gaslini children\u2019s hospital in Genoa.

The deadlock means we are almost certainly heading for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/snap-election-looming-five-factors-that-could-shape-the-result\" title=\"\">general election</a>, but the route towards one offers only stark options for both government and opposition \u2013 and risks putting severe strain on our constitution.</p> \n<p>Parliament has spoken unambiguously on its opposition to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords-agree-to-push-through-bill-preventing-no-deal-by-end-of-friday\" title=\"\">no-deal Brexit</a> by passing a new law mandating an extension. However, Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-rather-be-dead-in-ditch-than-agree-brexit-extension\" title=\"\">not ask to delay </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-rather-be-dead-in-ditch-than-agree-brexit-extension\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> beyond 31 October. At the same time, he has also said he will adhere to the law. This is an obvious contradiction.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the opposition parties (which, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/what-have-tory-rebels-voted-for-and-will-an-election-now-happen\" title=\"\">newly independent Conservatives</a>, form a majority in parliament) won\u2019t vote for an election until the Brexit deadline has been extended. So what happens next?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"27e85796-9301-41fa-8fde-a3e413abbc97\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FTLPHCu53o0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With parliament prorogued, no election is possible before Halloween. The next few weeks will see a continued hunt for a deal, party conferences and the start of a long campaign until the election proper is triggered.</p> \n<p>Whatever doubt exists over how serious the government is about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/08/brexit-boris-johnson-amber-rudd-resignation-live-news\" title=\"\">finding a deal</a>, this outcome is still a possibility. But even if the UK and EU could agree a deal, it would still need to pass in parliament \u2013 as would the ensuing legislation. Getting such a contentious piece of legislation through its many stages looks like a near-impossible challenge for a prime minister who leads a divided party and has a working majority that has gone from three to minus 43.</p> \n<p>The competing narratives from the extraordinary parliamentary battles will be rehashed at the party conferences and throughout an election campaign that will not wait for the formal starting gun. The Conservatives will push their line that parliament is against the people. The Liberal Democrats have come out in favour of revoking article 50. Labour will focus on the incompetence and chaos of the government.</p> \n<p>Parliament will return on 14 October. The government\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech will be about electoral positioning, but there\u2019s a good chance that it won\u2019t even pass the Commons. This effectively means that a government has lost confidence, and Johnson might even try to bring about a vote of no confidence in himself \u2013 a route set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act \u2013 to get to an election. But the first votes on the Queen\u2019s speech are due on 21 October, two days after the date when it is required that an extension be sought. And this type of no-confidence vote triggers a 14-day period \u2013 during which an alternative government could be formed \u2013 that will last well beyond 31 October. Opposition parties will be wary of giving him any mechanism to force no deal.</p> \n<p>If no extension had been agreed, then the pressure would be back on the opposition parties. To prevent a no-deal Brexit, they might have to vote no confidence in the government and show the Queen that they have a cross-party majority for an alternative government. A clear majority for an alternative meets Buckingham Palace\u2019s test for appointing a new prime minister.</p> \n<p>If opposition parties can agree on an alternative caretaker government \u2013 and that is still a big if \u2013 then they could oust Johnson, request an extension and trigger an election. Perhaps the current PM would be happy with this outcome if he believes it can help a \u201cdon\u2019t let them stop Brexit\u201d campaign narrative. But defeat in a vote of no confidence also means Johnson is out of No 10 and power could be handed to Jeremy Corbyn. If this outcome is unacceptable to the government, then it must return to the question of whether it accepts parliament\u2019s demand to delay Brexit.</p> \n<p>The government has said it will test the new law on extension \u201cto its limits\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Parliament is now suspended for five weeks, and the outcome of Brexit is as uncertain as ever. The deadlock means we are almost certainly heading for a general election, but the route towards one offers only stark options for both government and opposition \u2013 and risks putting severe strain on our constitution. Parliament has spoken unambiguously on its opposition to a no-deal Brexit by passing a new law mandating an extension. However, Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he will not ask to delay Brexit beyond 31 October. At the same time, he has also said he will adhere to the law. This is an obvious contradiction. Meanwhile, the opposition parties (which, with the newly independent Conservatives, form a majority in parliament) won\u2019t vote for an election until the Brexit deadline has been extended. So what happens next? With parliament prorogued, no election is possible before Halloween. The next few weeks will see a continued hunt for a deal, party conferences and the start of a long campaign until the election proper is triggered. Whatever doubt exists over how serious the government is about finding a deal, this outcome is still a possibility. But even if the UK and EU could agree a deal, it would still need to pass in parliament \u2013 as would the ensuing legislation. Getting such a contentious piece of legislation through its many stages looks like a near-impossible challenge for a prime minister who leads a divided party and has a working majority that has gone from three to minus 43. The competing narratives from the extraordinary parliamentary battles will be rehashed at the party conferences and throughout an election campaign that will not wait for the formal starting gun. The Conservatives will push their line that parliament is against the people. The Liberal Democrats have come out in favour of revoking article 50. Labour will focus on the incompetence and chaos of the government. Parliament will return on 14 October. The government\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech will be about electoral positioning, but there\u2019s a good chance that it won\u2019t even pass the Commons. This effectively means that a government has lost confidence, and Johnson might even try to bring about a vote of no confidence in himself \u2013 a route set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act \u2013 to get to an election. But the first votes on the Queen\u2019s speech are due on 21 October, two days after the date when it is required that an extension be sought. And this type of no-confidence vote triggers a 14-day period \u2013 during which an alternative government could be formed \u2013 that will last well beyond 31 October. Opposition parties will be wary of giving him any mechanism to force no deal. If no extension had been agreed, then the pressure would be back on the opposition parties. To prevent a no-deal Brexit, they might have to vote no confidence in the government and show the Queen that they have a cross-party majority for an alternative government. A clear majority for an alternative meets Buckingham Palace\u2019s test for appointing a new prime minister. If opposition parties can agree on an alternative caretaker government \u2013 and that is still a big if \u2013 then they could oust Johnson, request an extension and trigger an election. Perhaps the current PM would be happy with this outcome if he believes it can help a \u201cdon\u2019t let them stop Brexit\u201d campaign narrative. But defeat in a vote of no confidence also means Johnson is out of No 10 and power could be handed to Jeremy Corbyn. If this outcome is unacceptable to the government, then it must return to the question of whether it accepts parliament\u2019s demand to delay Brexit. The government has said it will test the new law on extension \u201cto its limits\u201d. This suggests that it wants a court case, with the PM perhaps keen to portray the courts, like parliament, as part of the Brexit-blocking establishment. It ought not be conceivable that a government would drop hints about defying the law. Yet that is what has happened. The official line is that the government will adhere to the law. Finding some way to test that law, or implying that every option has been exhausted, could allow the prime minister to argue that he has tried every means possible to get Brexit through but is being thwarted by this parliament, the opposition parties and the courts. At this point, does he reluctantly extend and then ask the people to elect a parliament that would deliver Brexit? If so, expect the rhetoric on parliament versus the people to heat up even more in the coming weeks. This October showdown risks placing the constitution under huge strain. For a government to defy the law, and therefore undermine the concept of the rule of law, is unconscionable \u2013 and the civil service will have repeatedly warned about the gravity of such a situation. And if a government refused to relinquish power after losing the confidence of the House, and despite an alternative government waiting in the wings, then the Queen would be dragged into the mess. The palace would strongly urge the government to resign. The idea of that happening while the government is being challenged in the courts ought to be unfathomable.

At school, he felt like a misfit: \u201cThey all came from a Bangladeshi community and I grew up in Millwall [where his parents settled when they came from Bangladesh in the 80s], which was predominantly white.\u201d</p> <p>He found his way to Central Saint Martins via a youth arts organisation, and at first his work \u201crarely touched on my culture\u201d, inspired instead by \u201cthe London scene I grew up in \u2013 grime music, the contrast between rich and poor in Canary Wharf, the history of Brick Lane and tailoring\u201d. But when Rana Plaza happened, Rahman had \u201can awakening\u201d and became set on creating designs that spoke to the craft and heritage of his parents\u2019 homeland. Inspiration comes from the mishmash that is his dad\u2019s personal style, with a colour palette taken from old family photographs.</p> <p>Last year, he took his first ever trip to Dhaka \u2013 \u201cI was like, mind blown,\u201d he says.

For autumn, however, he confounded expectations with a collection that combined men\u2019s and womenswear, and added far more rock\u2019n\u2019roll swagger than the upscale normcore look Philo fans would have expected. Tailored pencil dresses, motorbike trousers and belted, oversized coats came in leather of all finishes \u2013 from a cushioned version of the label\u2019s signature Intrecciato weave to an open loop design similar to chainmail. The shoes and the bags were instant hits.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this in years!\u201d said influencer and shoe enthusiast Sandra Hagelstam on her Instagram account as she posted a picture of five box-fresh pairs of slip-on square-toe heels.

      "bodyText": "Made in Bangladesh Rahemur Rahman\u2019s chat is rapid. He has a lot of ideas and talks quickly to cram them all in. Hailed as a breakout star from London fashion week men\u2019s, his naturally dyed, organic fabrics, and the jackets and trousers he tailors them into, are winning the 28-year-old fans from the UK to LA. Rahman\u2019s road hasn\u2019t always run smoothly. At school, he felt like a misfit: \u201cThey all came from a Bangladeshi community and I grew up in Millwall [where his parents settled when they came from Bangladesh in the 80s], which was predominantly white.\u201d He found his way to Central Saint Martins via a youth arts organisation, and at first his work \u201crarely touched on my culture\u201d, inspired instead by \u201cthe London scene I grew up in \u2013 grime music, the contrast between rich and poor in Canary Wharf, the history of Brick Lane and tailoring\u201d. But when Rana Plaza happened, Rahman had \u201can awakening\u201d and became set on creating designs that spoke to the craft and heritage of his parents\u2019 homeland. Inspiration comes from the mishmash that is his dad\u2019s personal style, with a colour palette taken from old family photographs. Last year, he took his first ever trip to Dhaka \u2013 \u201cI was like, mind blown,\u201d he says. He now markets his brand as made in Bangladesh: \u201cThe textiles are made there and I\u2019m made there, too.\u201d EVB The big easy Serena Bute\u2019s louche clothes may be airport style goals, but people will, she hopes, \u201cdo more than travel in them. Go to lunch, to yoga, dress them up for dinner.\u201d Versatility and ease are key to an eponymous collection that can be worn by Bute, by her kids, her mother and, of course, by you. EVB Patchworks at Coach Sometimes the finest ideas are staring you in the face \u2013 something certainly true of Coach creative director Stuart Vevers\u2019 AW19 stimuli. He was inspired to work with legendary textile designer Kaffe Fassett when he plucked one of Fassett\u2019s books from his shelf. \u201cThe best collaborations are the ones that are personal, with great creatives who bring something different to the table,\u201d enthuses Vevers, who incorporated Fassett\u2019s colour-pop prints and patchworked blooms into leather donkey coats, dipped-hem dresses and Lurex sweaters. With both men influenced by the American west coast, the juxtaposition of homespun and haute results in a textural feast. SC Hail, hail rock\u2019n\u2019roll Bottega Veneta\u2019s creative director Daniel Lee is to 2019 what Gucci\u2019s Alessandro Michele was to 2016. If that doesn\u2019t mean much to you, suffice to say he\u2019s this year\u2019s most hyped man in fashion. The 32-year-old Brit, a former Phoebe Philo protege at Celine, started the year by teasing an ad campaign that saw Philo worshippers immediately herald him as the natural successor to her understated minimalism. For autumn, however, he confounded expectations with a collection that combined men\u2019s and womenswear, and added far more rock\u2019n\u2019roll swagger than the upscale normcore look Philo fans would have expected. Tailored pencil dresses, motorbike trousers and belted, oversized coats came in leather of all finishes \u2013 from a cushioned version of the label\u2019s signature Intrecciato weave to an open loop design similar to chainmail. The shoes and the bags were instant hits. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this in years!\u201d said influencer and shoe enthusiast Sandra Hagelstam on her Instagram account as she posted a picture of five box-fresh pairs of slip-on square-toe heels. The outerwear items will no doubt be hit items when temperatures drop. With waiting lists already amassed for much of this inaugural collection, let the Lee effect commence. SC What every modern human wants Nanushka has won over its female fanbase with its vegan leather and super-sleek silhouettes, but this season it\u2019s widening its horizon to menswear. \u201cIt was always there in the back of my mind,\u201d says Sandra Sandor, who founded the Budapest-based brand in 2006. \u201cI was just waiting for the right time to launch it.\u201d The transition should be a smooth one: the cut of signature pieces has always been unisex, and a recent overhaul has seen Nanushka enjoy the hype of a new label, with Yara Shahidi, Sienna Miller and Hailey Bieber all fans. Echoing its promise to deliver \u201ca modern, versatile, day-to-night wardrobe for the modern human\u201d, Sandor says she wants \u201cto explore the fluid relationship between men and women, creating a genderless wardrobe with pieces that are beautiful but functional\u201d. The new collection features relaxed suiting, workwear-inspired shackets and a good line in wide-leg trousers, peppered with paisley prints and a pastel palette. \u201cInclusive and effortlessly modern is the best way to describe it,\u201d Sandor says. SC Second helpings New womenswear brand Ss\u014dne puts an emphasis on organic cottons, reduced water usage and the \u201chumanitarian side of working in fashion\u201d. It is important to founder Caroline Smithson that as much work by hand as possible goes into the brand\u2019s clothes \u2013 but that it doesn\u2019t come across \u201ctoo make-your-own-yoghurt\u201d. Shunning the seasonal model, Ss\u014dne instead hopes to develop a kind of uniform.

      "bodyText": "The right of Northern Irish people to identify as British, Irish or both does not automatically change their citizenship unless they formally register any change, an immigration tribunal has been told. Fundamental questions over the enforceability of the 1998 Good Friday agreement have been raised in a test case over the residency rights of an American who is married to a Derry woman. Emma DeSouza found herself at the centre of a legal battle after her application in 2015 for a residence card for her US-born husband, Jake DeSouza, was rejected. Any EU citizen living in the UK in accordance with EU regulations can bring their family with them. But the Home Office initially turned down the application on the grounds that Emma DeSouza was British, even though she had never carried a British passport. It said that as she was born in Northern Ireland, under the British Nationality Act 1981 she was automatically deemed British and would have to apply through the normal routes for third-country citizens. She could not therefore exercise separate EEA treaty rights. The Home Office told Mr DeSouza the only way it could deal with his case was for his wife to \u201crenounce her status as a British citizen\u201d. DeSouza challenged that decision on the grounds that his wife had the right to be treated as an Irish citizen under the Good Friday agreement and was therefore an EU citizen exercising her freedom of movement rights. The first-tier immigration and asylum tribunal ruled in his favour, saying that under the terms of the Good Friday agreement people of Northern Ireland were in a unique position within the United Kingdom and could identify themselves as Irish or British, or both. Appealing against that decision, however, Tony McGlennan QC for the Home Office argued that not all the contents of the agreement had been incorporated into UK law and it did not supersede the 1981 British Nationality Act. The initial tribunal had made a \u201cfundamental and egregious error\u201d, McGlennan said. Mrs DeSouza had held British citizenship since birth \u201cso she is not exercising treaty rights\u201d and therefore did not fit into the category of being an EEA national. \u201cThe mere act of identification does not change citizenship acquired at birth,\u201d said McGlennan. \u201cThere\u2019s no administrative formalities for the recording of that change. \u201c[Otherwise] a person born in Northern Ireland would be stateless unless they elected for one citizenship or another.\u201d Until DeSouza formally renounced her British citizenship she could not invoke her EEA treaty rights.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson is being urged to withdraw Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s knighthood over his conviction for domestic violence and the former England cricketer\u2019s response to criticism.</p> \n<p>Women\u2019s charities and opposition parties made the call after Boycott said he did not \u201cgive a toss\u201d about condemnation of his knighthood from a leading domestic violence charity.</p> \n<p>Responding to Adina Claire, the co-acting chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, who described his knighthood as part of former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list as \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d, Boycott told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Martha Kearney: \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love.\u201d</p> \n<p>The honour caused controversy because of Boycott\u2019s 1998 conviction for assault. His then girlfriend, Margaret Moore, was left with bruising to her forehead and black eyes.</p> \n<p>A French court fined him \u00a35,000 and handed down a three-month suspended jail sentence. He has always denied the charge, maintaining her injuries were sustained in an accidental fall. At his trial, the public prosecutor Jean-Yves Duval rejected this claim, saying the injuries were \u201cabsolutely incompatible\u201d with an accident.</p> \n<p>Claire said: \u201cCelebrating a man who was convicted for assaulting his partner sends a dangerous message that domestic abuse is not taken seriously as a crime.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith increasing awareness of domestic abuse, and a domestic abuse bill ready to be taken forward by government, it is extremely disappointing that a knighthood has been recommended for Geoffrey Boycott, who is a convicted perpetrator of domestic abuse.\u201d</p> \n<p>May, who introduced a landmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/06/prorogation-of-uk-parliament-must-not-delay-domestic-abuse-reform-say-activists\">domestic abuse bill</a> to parliament earlier this year, gave Boycott a knighthood for services to sport.</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman from the Woman\u2019s Trust said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see Geoffrey Boycott included in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/theresa-may-accused-of-cronyism-over-resignation-honours\">Theresa May\u2019s honours list</a>, given her vocal support for domestic abuse survivors and the domestic abuse bill.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an extraordinary exchange, Kearney asked why Boycott had not been given the honour sooner, and suggested one reason could be the conviction. The former cricketer proclaimed his innocence and cited the conviction as a reason for<strong> </strong>his outspoken support for Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d6ce1e7bba25e01577d9e01413b40b238be51ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d6ce1e7bba25e01577d9e01413b40b238be51ec/0_3_4084_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Kearney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boycott made the comments while speaking to Martha Kearney on the BBC\u2019s Today programme.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He went on to say, \u201cYou can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it\u201d, and claimed the presumption of innocence was reversed in the French legal system. In France, as in Britain, defendants are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago, love. In a French court, she [Moore] tried to blackmail me for \u00a31m. I said no, because in England if you pay any money at all, we think: \u2018Hang on, there must be something there.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not paying anything\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d actually got a million at the time.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a court case in France where you\u2019re guilty, which is one of the reasons I [didn\u2019t] vote to remain in Europe \u2013 because you\u2019re guilty until you\u2019re proved innocent. That\u2019s totally the opposite from England and it\u2019s very difficult to prove you\u2019re innocent in another country and another language.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost people in England don\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t do it. Move on. It\u2019s a cross I have to bear, right or wrong, good or bad, I have to live with it. And I do, because I\u2019m clear in my mind and I think most people in England are that it\u2019s not true.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care a toss about her, love. It was 25 years ago. You can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it. You want to talk to me about my knighthood. It\u2019s very nice of you to have me, but I couldn\u2019t give a toss.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is just recognition of my cricket. [It\u2019s] very nice, very honoured, thankful to Theresa May and I thank all the people that supported me and cared for me throughout my cricketing career.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to Boycott\u2019s comments disputing the conviction, Claire told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme that the knighthood should be withdrawn, describing it as a \u201ctragedy\u201d that sends \u201ca really terrible message to survivors\u201d. She added: \u201cI believe [the knighthood] should be taken away, absolutely\u201d.</p> \n<p>She also spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, where she expressed her disappointment in May, describing Boycott\u2019s honour as a \u201cmisstep\u201d that undermined her record for tackling domestic abuse.</p> \n<p>She said women were in limbo as they waited to hear whether Johnson\u2019s government would continue to move May\u2019s legislation forward.</p> \n<p>Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said the honour was \u201can insult to victims and survivors of domestic violence.\u201d </p> \n<p>She added: \u201cHonouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister\u2019s favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is.</p> \n<p>\u201cBoris Johnson should rescind his knighthood today. The whole honours system needs radically overhauling, alongside peerages, so that our political system works for the many not the few.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Challen, a domestic violence campaigner added his voice to those calling for the knighthood to be rescinded. Challen, whose mother, Sally Challen was recently freed from prison after killing her husband following decades of abuse, tweeted: </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/David_Challen/status/1171428682293886978\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The absolute state of our society for knighting a man who has a conviction for domestic abuse and shows no remorse.<br><br>Even Boycott\u2019s reply to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Marthakearney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Marthakearney</a> in response to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/womensaid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@womensaid</a>\u2019s concerns was sexist bile:<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love.\u201d<br><br>Revoke his knighthood now <a href=\"https://t.co/naRxW4rwpn\">https://t.co/naRxW4rwpn</a></p>\u2014 David Challen (@David_Challen) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Challen/status/1171428682293886978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 10, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Reacting to Boycott\u2019s radio appearance, the Women\u2019s Equality party called for a \u201cBoycott boycott\u201d. The party\u2019s leader, Mandu Reid, said: \u201cThe contempt shown by Boycott on the Today programme this morning highlights precisely why he shouldn\u2019t be celebrated by the British establishment or anyone, and why he shouldn\u2019t be given airtime by the media.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is being urged to withdraw Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s knighthood over his conviction for domestic violence and the former England cricketer\u2019s response to criticism. Women\u2019s charities and opposition parties made the call after Boycott said he did not \u201cgive a toss\u201d about condemnation of his knighthood from a leading domestic violence charity. Responding to Adina Claire, the co-acting chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, who described his knighthood as part of former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list as \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d, Boycott told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Martha Kearney: \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love.\u201d The honour caused controversy because of Boycott\u2019s 1998 conviction for assault. His then girlfriend, Margaret Moore, was left with bruising to her forehead and black eyes. A French court fined him \u00a35,000 and handed down a three-month suspended jail sentence. He has always denied the charge, maintaining her injuries were sustained in an accidental fall. At his trial, the public prosecutor Jean-Yves Duval rejected this claim, saying the injuries were \u201cabsolutely incompatible\u201d with an accident. Claire said: \u201cCelebrating a man who was convicted for assaulting his partner sends a dangerous message that domestic abuse is not taken seriously as a crime. \u201cWith increasing awareness of domestic abuse, and a domestic abuse bill ready to be taken forward by government, it is extremely disappointing that a knighthood has been recommended for Geoffrey Boycott, who is a convicted perpetrator of domestic abuse.\u201d May, who introduced a landmark domestic abuse bill to parliament earlier this year, gave Boycott a knighthood for services to sport. A spokeswoman from the Woman\u2019s Trust said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see Geoffrey Boycott included in Theresa May\u2019s honours list, given her vocal support for domestic abuse survivors and the domestic abuse bill.\u201d In an extraordinary exchange, Kearney asked why Boycott had not been given the honour sooner, and suggested one reason could be the conviction. The former cricketer proclaimed his innocence and cited the conviction as a reason for his outspoken support for Brexit. He went on to say, \u201cYou can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it\u201d, and claimed the presumption of innocence was reversed in the French legal system. In France, as in Britain, defendants are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. He said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago, love. In a French court, she [Moore] tried to blackmail me for \u00a31m. I said no, because in England if you pay any money at all, we think: \u2018Hang on, there must be something there.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not paying anything\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d actually got a million at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a court case in France where you\u2019re guilty, which is one of the reasons I [didn\u2019t] vote to remain in Europe \u2013 because you\u2019re guilty until you\u2019re proved innocent. That\u2019s totally the opposite from England and it\u2019s very difficult to prove you\u2019re innocent in another country and another language. \u201cMost people in England don\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t do it. Move on. It\u2019s a cross I have to bear, right or wrong, good or bad, I have to live with it. And I do, because I\u2019m clear in my mind and I think most people in England are that it\u2019s not true. \u201cI don\u2019t care a toss about her, love. It was 25 years ago. You can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it. You want to talk to me about my knighthood. It\u2019s very nice of you to have me, but I couldn\u2019t give a toss. \u201cThis is just recognition of my cricket. [It\u2019s] very nice, very honoured, thankful to Theresa May and I thank all the people that supported me and cared for me throughout my cricketing career.\u201d In response to Boycott\u2019s comments disputing the conviction, Claire told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme that the knighthood should be withdrawn, describing it as a \u201ctragedy\u201d that sends \u201ca really terrible message to survivors\u201d. She added: \u201cI believe [the knighthood] should be taken away, absolutely\u201d. She also spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, where she expressed her disappointment in May, describing Boycott\u2019s honour as a \u201cmisstep\u201d that undermined her record for tackling domestic abuse. She said women were in limbo as they waited to hear whether Johnson\u2019s government would continue to move May\u2019s legislation forward. Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said the honour was \u201can insult to victims and survivors of domestic violence.\u201d She added: \u201cHonouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister\u2019s favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is. \u201cBoris Johnson should rescind his knighthood today. The whole honours system needs radically overhauling, alongside peerages, so that our political system works for the many not the few.\u201d David Challen, a domestic violence campaigner added his voice to those calling for the knighthood to be rescinded. Challen, whose mother, Sally Challen was recently freed from prison after killing her husband following decades of abuse, tweeted: Reacting to Boycott\u2019s radio appearance, the Women\u2019s Equality party called for a \u201cBoycott boycott\u201d. The party\u2019s leader, Mandu Reid, said: \u201cThe contempt shown by Boycott on the Today programme this morning highlights precisely why he shouldn\u2019t be celebrated by the British establishment or anyone, and why he shouldn\u2019t be given airtime by the media. Putting men like him on a pedestal is indefensible and sends a message that violence is normal and acceptable.\u201d The Yorkshire-born former Spice Girl Melanie Brown, who has accused her ex-husband Stephen Belafonte of domestic abuse, also criticised the decision, saying Boycott was \u201ca disgrace to Yorkshire\u201d. The shadow policing minister, Louise Haigh, who is the MP for Sheffield Heeley, labelled the BBC pundit \u201can embarrassment to Yorkshire\u201d in a tweet. Boycott was forced to apologise in 2017 for suggesting he would have to black up to be awarded a knighthood. He is alleged to have said the honour was handed out like \u201cconfetti\u201d to West Indies cricketers, saying: \u201cMine\u2019s been turned down twice. I\u2019d better black me face.\u201d An estimated 1.3 million women and 695,000 men experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2018, according to Office for National Statistics figures from November 2018.",

St Mary\u2019s cares for 1,350 people a year. About 170 of those become inpatients while the others receive care from a \u201chospice at home\u201d team. The departing doctor is the most senior of its three medics who, alongside 23 nurses and two local GPs who help out at weekends, provide 24/7 care. Stangoe added: \u201cDespite repeated efforts over a number of months, both alone and working in partnership with local health organisations, we have as yet been unable to fill specialist doctor vacancies or find sufficient cover. \u201cAs a specialist unit there are strict rules about the level of doctor who is able to take responsibility for our patients. And while we have some fantastic doctors at the hospice they do not have the required length of experience to take this central role at this time, when our more experienced doctor leaves,\u201d she added. Its efforts to find a palliative care specialist with at least five years\u2019 experience have drawn a blank despite advertising in the BMJ and on the NHS Jobs and Hospice UK websites. The decision highlights how both NHS and charitably run hospices are being affected by the UK\u2019s lack of medical staff. \u201cNationwide there is a shortage of experienced palliative care doctors. There is no quick fix to address this, but it makes it even more important to support the key clinical staff that we have,\u201d said Carole Walford, the chief clinical officer for Hospice UK. Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair and Cumbria representative of the British Medical Association, said: \u201cFor patients to be denied the right and proper care at the end of their lives because of staff shortages is untenable. \u201cPalliative care is absolutely vital for many terminally ill people. It is wholly unacceptable that at a time when patients and their families need the most comfort and care, the recruitment crisis in the NHS means they are being denied it, or at best being forced to receive alternative care further from home.\u201d Official figures show that the NHS in England has about 100,000 vacancies for staff, including 9,000 doctors and 40,000 nurses.",

      "bodyText": "Surreal, innovative and political paintings by an American artist worshipped by Andy Warhol have gone on display in London. James Rosenquist was a pop art pioneer whose name is well known in America and parts of Europe, but far less so in the UK. The London show, at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, which occupies a stupendously grand 18th-century townhouse in Mayfair, may go a small way towards changing that. It focuses on his work in the 1960s, when he was part of a New York gang that included artists such as Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg, and shows how he was frequently ahead of his time. He was often interested in the experiential side of visual art. On loan from the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, and shown for the first time in the UK, is Forest Ranger (1967), a 4-metre-high painting of a tank which hangs from the ceiling like a stripped plastic curtain and which visitors are invited to walk through. Rosenquist died in 2017, aged 83. In the 1960s he was a key pop art player although it was a label none of the artists were keen on. \u201cNo one of them liked that term,\u201d said Rosenquist\u2019s widow, Mimi Thompson Rosenquist. \u201cThey all said \u2018what does that mean\u2019 because they were all so different. They all used commercial imagery in some way but they all used it so differently.\u201d He was part of a remarkable community of artists which also included Agnes Martin and Jasper Johns. \u201cIt was a smaller art world then and they all really knew each other and they all looked at each other\u2019s work,\u201d said Thompson Rosenquist. \u201cThey always knew what was happening. \u201cIt was very open and supportive \u2026 they were competitive but there was no money involved at that time so people weren\u2019t as competitive as they are now.\u201d Warhol wrote in his diaries how Rosenquist was his favourite artist. And he told him. \u201cWhen he and Jim would see each other Andy would say: \u2018Jim, you know you\u2019re my favourite artist,\u2019 and Jim would say: \u2018No Andy, you\u2019re my favourite artist.\u2019 This would go back and forth for a while until they got tired of it.\u201d The London exhibition explores how surrealism influenced Rosenquist and how politics, overtly or subtly, was always bound up in the meaning of his works. James Rosenquist: Visualising the Sixties is at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in London, 10 September to 9 November.",

They were the land of freedom, democracy, opportunity for all, and therefore they were not showcasing their shadow side \u2026 once that opponent was gone, everything could come out of the cupboard that had always been there. Out it has come.\u201d With protesters around the world adopting the red costumes of the Handmaids to silently campaign for women\u2019s rights, including demonstrations in Ireland, Argentina and recently in Texas, where an all-male council voted to ban abortion in June, Atwood said her creations worked as a form of civil protest. \u201cYou\u2019re not making a disturbance, not saying anything ... you\u2019re all covered up, no frightful bare shoulders,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of this would be happening if countries were not putting other people in charge of women\u2019s bodies. If everything were fair and equitable, and government really was by consent of the governed, only potentially pregnant women would be able to vote on these matters.\u201d With The Testaments shortlisted for the Booker prize \u2013 judges called it a \u201csavage and beautiful novel\u201d which \u201cspeaks to us today, all around the world, with particular conviction and power\u201d \u2013 and readers so desperate to get their hands on the book that they were queueing up for it at midnight, Atwood gave a wry smile to suggestions that she is a literary rock star. \u201cConsidering the lives rock stars lead, I hope not. I haven\u2019t yet died of an opiate overdose, not yet, but there\u2019s time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis kind of thing could be quite ruinous for a 35-year-old because where do you go from there? But in my case we kind of know the answer.\u201d One thing she refused to rule out was whether she would ever return to Gilead again: \u201cNever say never to anything.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brazil saw an alarming rise in racial abuse, sexual assault, femicide and violence against women and LGBT people in 2018, according to new figures released on Tuesday. The data illustrates a country which became more bigoted and more polarised against the backdrop of last year\u2019s incendiary election campaign and the increase in inflammatory rhetoric by the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his supporters, specialists said. \u201cWe are observing a rise in violence against women in all forms: aggression, femicide and rape,\u201d said Samira Bueno, executive director of the Brazilian Public Security Forum, which published the figures using state and federal government data. Intentional violent deaths \u2013 which include homicides, robberies leading to death, deaths of police officers \u2013 fell by 10% in 2018 to 57,341. Murders of police officers also fell \u2013 from 373 to 343. But femicides rose by more than 4% to 1,206. A total of 66,041 incidents of sexual violence were reported in 2018, of which 82% were against women and girls, a 4.1% rise on the previous year and the highest number ever registered. More than half of the female victims were girls under 13. With 263,067 domestic violence injuries reported, the figures indicated a woman was attacked in Brazil every two minutes. Bueno cited Bolsonaro\u2019s inflammatory language \u2013 such as telling a congresswoman she did not deserve to be raped and his praise for cold war-era Latin American torturers \u2013 as contributing factors. \u201cHe is always sharing with people what he thinks of women, what he thinks of torture. It\u2019s hard not to believe that if you have a maximum authority saying this that this does not have an impact on people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are more prejudiced because we have political leaders who articulate this.\u201d Beatriz Accioly Lins, an anthropologist and researcher at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and specialist in violence against women, said the numbers showed more women were coming forward.

Accioly said the number of rapes of girls showed how Brazilian society \u201csexualised girls very young\u201d. \u201cThose who work in this area recognise that violence against girls is very high at this age,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the reality we live in.\u201d Killings by police officers during and outside service soared 20%, to 6,220, a trend that is likely to continue as Bolsonaro pushes legislation to shield from prosecution members of the security forces and citizens who shoot alleged offenders.

With Boris Johnson facing a choice between breaking his word and extending the UK\u2019s membership of the EU beyond 31 October, or bringing back a tweaked deal for a last-gasp vote in parliament, officials and diplomats have expressed hope the prime minister will make a U-turn. EU sources insisted there was no other approach that could work and the negotiations were otherwise doomed to hit a \u201czombie stage\u201d given the likelihood of an imminent general election. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what mandate the prime minister has to propose something and obviously there is a strong division between the parliament and the government,\u201d said Nathalie Loiseau, a former French minister for EU affairs. It is hoped in Brussels that Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, will further pursue a Northern Ireland-only backstop during meetings with the European commission\u2019s Brexit taskforce on Wednesday and Friday. The newly nominated EU commissioner for trade, Phil Hogan, a former Irish minister, told the Irish Times he believed the \u201cpenny is finally dropping\u201d in Johnson\u2019s government over the lack of alternatives. The idea was originally rejected by May on the grounds it was unpalatable to her partners in the Democratic Unionist party, on which she relied for her working majority.

      "bodyText": "The former Irish prime minister and joint architect of the Northern Ireland peace process Bertie Ahern has said it is imperative that any Brexit solution be acceptable to the Democratic Unionist party. His intervention is a rare warning by a prominent politician in the Republic of Ireland that imposing a deal not supported by the DUP, such as one with a Northern-Ireland-only backstop, would imperil a lasting solution. Ahern said the principle of \u201cparity of esteem\u201d, one of the core stated values of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, was not just for nationalists and anything that was not backed by both communities in Northern Ireland would be doomed to failure. \u201cAny solution has to include the unionist people because parity of esteem in the Good Friday agreement is both sides; to do a deal through Europe with Britain that creates a problem for the unionist community and will be rejected by the English nationalists in the Commons \u2013 that\u2019s not really an option,\u201d he said. Ahern\u2019s comments came as the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, demanded a meeting with Boris Johnson amid fears he is prepared to back a Northern-Ireland-only backstop, which her party rejected in 2017. Ahern, along with Tony Blair, played a critical role in getting warring factions in Northern Ireland to lay down their arms and opposing political parties to sign a lasting peace deal. Ahern\u2019s intervention comes at a critical time in the Brexit talks, with speculation that Johnson is prepared to return to the plan for a Northern-Ireland-only backstop, which emerged during the first phase of talks in 2017 but was abandoned after the DUP objected. The former taoiseach said he believed there could be merit in a Northern-Ireland-only backstop if the Stormont assembly had a role, because the DUP might support that. Referring to the DUP\u2019s leader in the Commons, he said: \u201cI think Nigel Dodds has given an indication that if the executive had a role and future laws and regulations were coming out of the European Union and they had a say, not a veto, he didn\u2019t say a veto, then perhaps that is something that is workable.\u201d Mirroring Ahern\u2019s remarks about the unionist community, Foster told an audience on Monday evening that it was important they engage with those of a nationalist background. Ahern said he was implacably opposed to any checks at or near the Irish border, saying there would be civil disobedience among border communities and the checks would be unsustainable. \u201cThe idea of checking a guy leaving Dundalk with four dozen heads of cabbage and going to Newry and counting them up on the border is not on. It would be stupid to try that. I don\u2019t want to say it would lead to violence but it wouldn\u2019t be sustainable, it wouldn\u2019t be workable,\u201d he said. Under EU law, all animals and fresh produce including raw meat must undergo mandatory checks and last week the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said there would be checks near the border. Ahern said they would need to be done near the border but \u201cback in offices, point of manufacture or point of distribution\u201d. He said the scenes in parliament over the last week showed \u201cthe level of raw bitterness\u201d in British politics, but Ireland must not get dragged into domestic battles. \u201cWe have to leave all these clouds to fade into the sky and keep our focus on the Barnier commission and continue to negotiate, if there is anything to negotiate. \u201cWe have to at least have an open mind on what might come forward, so we are seen by the 27 member states that we\u2019re not heads in the sands, that we have a negotiating hand that is different,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The teenager convicted of the rape and murder of the six-year-old schoolgirl Alesha MacPhail has had his 27-year minimum sentence reduced. Lawyers for Aaron Campbell, who was 16 when he was jailed for killing the child on the Isle of Bute in Scotland, had argued that his sentencing was \u201cexcessive and amounted to a miscarriage of justice\u201d. In a judgment published on Tuesday, three judges ruled the sentence should be reduced to 24 years on account of the killer\u2019s age at the time of the murder. The ruling sparked criticism in Scotland, with the Scottish Conservative party calling it a \u201cdisgraceful outcome\u201d that would cause massive upset to Alesha\u2019s family. \u201cThis is one of the most vile criminals in Scotland, and he should not be enjoying having time shaved off his sentence,\u201d said the Scottish Conservative shadow justice secretary, Liam Kerr. The defence QC Brian McConnachie, who represented Campbell during his trial in February, had argued in court in Edinburgh last month that the killing in July last year was \u201can appalling and heinous crime\u201d. But he said the trial judge, Lord Matthews, had attached too great an importance to two sentencing reports that were unduly pessimistic about Campbell\u2019s capacity for rehabilitation, and thus imposed an excessive \u201cpunishment part\u201d of 27 years to his life sentence. In their judgment, the appeal judges concluded that the extent to which Campbell was likely to present a future risk, the appalling nature of the crime and the bleak prospects for change \u201cled the trial judge to make inadequate allowance for the mitigatory effect of youth\u201d. Campbell\u2019s dysfunctional home background, absence of boundaries and parenting problems, \u201cincluding a degree of physical and emotional abuse\u201d, were noted in the ruling from Lord Drummond Young, Lord Menzies and Lady Dorrian. These are all factors that may have adversely impacted on the development of his character, the judges found, \u201cbut which may not entirely dictate development of his character in the future\u201d. \u201cWe have concluded that a punishment part of 24 years would be appropriate to reflect the appellant\u2019s youth,\u201d they added. \u201cAs with all punishment parts, this is not an indication of the date when the appellant will be released.

      "body": "<p>Catalonia\u2019s vice-president has warned the looming verdict in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/12/catalan-leaders-did-not-engage-in-rebellion-spanish-court-told\">trial of 12 separatist leaders</a> could trigger the formation of a regional \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d of pro-independence parties and those in favour of an officially agreed referendum on self-determination.</p> <p>Speaking as Catalonia prepares to celebrate its national day (Diada) on Wednesday, Pere Aragon\u00e8s said such an alliance would help increase the pressure on the Spanish government to find a political solution to the Catalan issue.</p> <p>A dozen separatist leaders, including Aragon\u00e8s\u2019s predecessor, Oriol Junqueras, are on trial at Spain\u2019s supreme court over their alleged roles in the failed push for regional independence in October 2017.</p> <p>Nine of them \u2013 including Junqueras, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell, and two influential grassroots activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez \u2013 are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Other charges include sedition and misuse of public funds.</p> <p>Notably absent from the trial has been the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who along with some colleagues fled into self-imposed exile abroad after the then government of Mariano Rajoy responded to the unilateral referendum and subsequent declaration of independence by using the constitution to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/spanish-pm-mariano-rajoy-asks-senate-powers-dismiss-catalonia-president\">assume control of the region</a>.</p> <p>With a verdict expected next month, pro-independence Catalans and those who view the prisoners\u2019 treatment and possible sentences as unnecessarily harsh are planning to use the Diada on 11 September as another show of support and defiance.</p> <p>Aragon\u00e8s said while the verdict could prompt legal appeals on human rights grounds and unleash \u201cmassive, peaceful civil demonstrations\u201d, it would also yield an \u201cinstitutional\u201d response.</p> <p>\u201cOur first option would be for what we call a government of national unity made up of all of us who want a political, rather than penal, solution \u2013 all of us who want a referendum, freedom for the political prisoners and the return of the leaders in exile,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe could join together in government to force the state to open political negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>Aragon\u00e8s said such a government could include pro-independence parties \u2013 his own Catalan Republican Left (ERC), Together for Catalonia and the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy \u2013 as well as the so-called Commons, an alliance of leftwing parties including the local branch of Podemos, which favours an independence referendum agreed with the Spanish government.</p> <p>He also said a regional election could be held in an effort to increase the pro-independence bloc in the Catalan parliament.</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not our plan A,\u201d Aragon\u00e8s said. \u201cOur plan A is to reinforce the governing majority to pass the 2020 budget and secure the backing of all those who believe that the solution lies in voting, not prison sentences.\u201d</p> <p>Catalonia is fairly evenly divided on the question of independence. Pro-independence parties have never managed to win 50% of the vote in the regional parliament, and the October 2017 referendum held in defiance of the Spanish courts and constitution had a turnout of about 43%.</p> <p>Aragon\u00e8s, who described the Rajoy government\u2019s heavy-handed efforts to stop the referendum as \u201ca laboratory study in how to suppress political dissidence in western Europe\u201d, said the prisoners\u2019 plight had attracted the support of many people who opposed independence.</p> <p>\u201cSolidarity with the political prisoners is far greater than the support for Catalan independence: there are a lot of people who, despite not being pro-independence, have been against the pre-trial detention and who view any custodial sentence passed on social and pro-independence leaders as a clear mistake,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ERC, which governs Catalonia alongside Puigdemont\u2019s Together for Yes party, has opted for a markedly less confrontational approach than its coalition partners. Puigdemont and his successor, Quim Torra, both favour keeping tensions high with Madrid in order to maintain the pro-independence movement\u2019s waning momentum.</p> <p>Aragon\u00e8s acknowledged the divisions within the independence bloc but said they were smaller than the differences between the Socialist party of the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and the anti-austerity Podemos, which are still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/spanish-pm-unveils-progressive-policies-to-head-off-snap-election\">trying to form a national government</a> after the general election in April.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez, who toppled Rajoy\u2019s government in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/mariano-rajoy-ousted-as-spain-prime-minister\">no-confidence vote last year,</a> has shown himself far more willing to listen to the Catalan government than his predecessor.</p> <p>But he has made it clear there will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/protests-barcelona-spanish-prime-minister-catalan-leader-meet\">no independence referendum</a> and the country\u2019s constitution \u2013 which stresses \u201cthe indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation\u201d \u2013 must be respected.</p> <p>Aragon\u00e8s conceded there was no fast track to Catalan independence.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who lead [the ERC] \u2013 and I\u2019ve been a campaigning member for 20 years, since I was a teenager \u2013 know that this is a historical process,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to historical processes, you have to build up your forces and it\u2019s not a lineal business. It\u2019s not an administrative process of step one and then step two. It\u2019s a complicated business. You can\u2019t just arrive at independence at 6am tomorrow morning, however much you might want to.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, about 1 million people gathered in Barcelona to use the Diada as a platform to renew their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/11/catalans-renew-calls-independence-rally-barcelona\">calls for Catalan independence</a> and demand the release of the jailed leaders.</p> <p>Although the annual celebrations commemorate the fall of the city at the end of the Spanish war of succession in 1714, in recent years they have been used by pro-independence groups as a show of strength.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Catalonia\u2019s vice-president has warned the looming verdict in the trial of 12 separatist leaders could trigger the formation of a regional \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d of pro-independence parties and those in favour of an officially agreed referendum on self-determination. Speaking as Catalonia prepares to celebrate its national day (Diada) on Wednesday, Pere Aragon\u00e8s said such an alliance would help increase the pressure on the Spanish government to find a political solution to the Catalan issue. A dozen separatist leaders, including Aragon\u00e8s\u2019s predecessor, Oriol Junqueras, are on trial at Spain\u2019s supreme court over their alleged roles in the failed push for regional independence in October 2017. Nine of them \u2013 including Junqueras, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell, and two influential grassroots activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez \u2013 are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Other charges include sedition and misuse of public funds. Notably absent from the trial has been the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who along with some colleagues fled into self-imposed exile abroad after the then government of Mariano Rajoy responded to the unilateral referendum and subsequent declaration of independence by using the constitution to assume control of the region. With a verdict expected next month, pro-independence Catalans and those who view the prisoners\u2019 treatment and possible sentences as unnecessarily harsh are planning to use the Diada on 11 September as another show of support and defiance. Aragon\u00e8s said while the verdict could prompt legal appeals on human rights grounds and unleash \u201cmassive, peaceful civil demonstrations\u201d, it would also yield an \u201cinstitutional\u201d response. \u201cOur first option would be for what we call a government of national unity made up of all of us who want a political, rather than penal, solution \u2013 all of us who want a referendum, freedom for the political prisoners and the return of the leaders in exile,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could join together in government to force the state to open political negotiations.\u201d Aragon\u00e8s said such a government could include pro-independence parties \u2013 his own Catalan Republican Left (ERC), Together for Catalonia and the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy \u2013 as well as the so-called Commons, an alliance of leftwing parties including the local branch of Podemos, which favours an independence referendum agreed with the Spanish government. He also said a regional election could be held in an effort to increase the pro-independence bloc in the Catalan parliament. \u201cBut that\u2019s not our plan A,\u201d Aragon\u00e8s said. \u201cOur plan A is to reinforce the governing majority to pass the 2020 budget and secure the backing of all those who believe that the solution lies in voting, not prison sentences.\u201d Catalonia is fairly evenly divided on the question of independence. Pro-independence parties have never managed to win 50% of the vote in the regional parliament, and the October 2017 referendum held in defiance of the Spanish courts and constitution had a turnout of about 43%. Aragon\u00e8s, who described the Rajoy government\u2019s heavy-handed efforts to stop the referendum as \u201ca laboratory study in how to suppress political dissidence in western Europe\u201d, said the prisoners\u2019 plight had attracted the support of many people who opposed independence. \u201cSolidarity with the political prisoners is far greater than the support for Catalan independence: there are a lot of people who, despite not being pro-independence, have been against the pre-trial detention and who view any custodial sentence passed on social and pro-independence leaders as a clear mistake,\u201d he said. The ERC, which governs Catalonia alongside Puigdemont\u2019s Together for Yes party, has opted for a markedly less confrontational approach than its coalition partners. Puigdemont and his successor, Quim Torra, both favour keeping tensions high with Madrid in order to maintain the pro-independence movement\u2019s waning momentum. Aragon\u00e8s acknowledged the divisions within the independence bloc but said they were smaller than the differences between the Socialist party of the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and the anti-austerity Podemos, which are still trying to form a national government after the general election in April. S\u00e1nchez, who toppled Rajoy\u2019s government in a no-confidence vote last year, has shown himself far more willing to listen to the Catalan government than his predecessor. But he has made it clear there will be no independence referendum and the country\u2019s constitution \u2013 which stresses \u201cthe indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation\u201d \u2013 must be respected. Aragon\u00e8s conceded there was no fast track to Catalan independence. \u201cThe people who lead [the ERC] \u2013 and I\u2019ve been a campaigning member for 20 years, since I was a teenager \u2013 know that this is a historical process,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to historical processes, you have to build up your forces and it\u2019s not a lineal business. It\u2019s not an administrative process of step one and then step two. It\u2019s a complicated business. You can\u2019t just arrive at independence at 6am tomorrow morning, however much you might want to.\u201d Last year, about 1 million people gathered in Barcelona to use the Diada as a platform to renew their calls for Catalan independence and demand the release of the jailed leaders. Although the annual celebrations commemorate the fall of the city at the end of the Spanish war of succession in 1714, in recent years they have been used by pro-independence groups as a show of strength.",

This innuendo is made all the more delicious because the lovely Miss Pettigrew is almost certainly unaware of what\u2019s being implied. Perhaps her original readers were equally oblivious, although I\u2019m hoping that they laughed as much as me at this passage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/aug/14/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Winifred Watson</a> had done a commendable job of priming them for naughtiness by this point in the book. As Miss Pettigrew\u2019s unexpectedly enjoyable day develops, and she finds herself swept up into Miss LaFosse\u2019s louche world, she encounters all kinds of taboos. There have been jokes about cocaine and Miss LaFosse\u2019s three lovers. There have been impressive amounts of daytime drinking, wailing saxophones and nightclubs.

Delightfully, she\u2019d written the material that upset them in just six weeks, thinking up the dialogue while she did the dishes: \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone like Miss Pettigrew. I just made it all up. I haven\u2019t the faintest idea what governesses really do. I\u2019ve never been to a nightclub and I certainly didn\u2019t know anyone who took cocaine.\u201d</p> <p>All the more impressive that she worried her publishers so. But Methuen had underestimated the reading public, who made the book a bestseller when it eventually came out. Just as bad, they missed one of the most charming things about Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day: all the fun that Miss Pettigrew has is harmless. It isn\u2019t really a book about bad behaviour; it\u2019s about finding goodness. When Miss Pettigrew literally and metaphorically lets her hair down, steps out of her dowdy and threadbare governess clothes and starts hitting the sherry, she leaves behind a life that has been cruel, cold and pinched.</p> <p>Just after Miss Pettigrew\u2019s employment agency makes the error that sets the plot in motion, sending her to Miss LaFosse instead of a family seeking a governess, we see our hero out on the street:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMiss Pettigrew joined the throng, a middle-aged, rather angular lady, of medium height, thin through lack of good food, with a timid, defeated expression and terror quite discernible in her eyes, if anyone cared to look. But there was no personal friend or relation in the whole world who knew or cared whether Miss Pettigrew was alive or dead.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Wonderfully, Miss Pettigrew soon meets people who do care. Miss LaFosse is not a \u201clady\u201d and does not have much of the Christian \u201cvirtue\u201d her father demanded \u2013 but she is generous, warm and affectionate. So much so that she moves Miss Pettigrew to tears by simply asking if she is \u201call right\u201d:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Miss Pettigrew. \u201cYou can set your mind at rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh you darling!\u201d Miss LaFosse leaned forward impulsively and kissed her again, and there, right on Miss Pettigrew\u2019s clasped hands, fell two drops of water and two more were trickling down her cheeks.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s something you may not expect to read in a bestselling book from 1938 about a virginal governess: \u201cBut he\u2019s a grand lover,\u201d said Miss LaFosse wistfully. \u201cNo doubt,\u201d said Miss Pettigrew. \u201cAll practice makes perfect.\u201d \u201cHe reaches marvellous heights,\u201d pursued Miss LaFosse pleadingly. \u201cWhat interests me,\u201d said Miss Pettigrew,\u201d is the staying power.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Miss LaFosse. Oh, indeed. This innuendo is made all the more delicious because the lovely Miss Pettigrew is almost certainly unaware of what\u2019s being implied. Perhaps her original readers were equally oblivious, although I\u2019m hoping that they laughed as much as me at this passage. Winifred Watson had done a commendable job of priming them for naughtiness by this point in the book. As Miss Pettigrew\u2019s unexpectedly enjoyable day develops, and she finds herself swept up into Miss LaFosse\u2019s louche world, she encounters all kinds of taboos. There have been jokes about cocaine and Miss LaFosse\u2019s three lovers. There have been impressive amounts of daytime drinking, wailing saxophones and nightclubs. There has, in other words, been a lot of fun. It was so much fun that Winifred Watson\u2019s original publisher Methuen became worried. \u201cThey feared it was too risqu\u00e9,\u201d Watson told the Times in 2000, when she was 94 and her book was enjoying a second life after being republished by Persephone. Delightfully, she\u2019d written the material that upset them in just six weeks, thinking up the dialogue while she did the dishes: \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone like Miss Pettigrew. I just made it all up. I haven\u2019t the faintest idea what governesses really do. I\u2019ve never been to a nightclub and I certainly didn\u2019t know anyone who took cocaine.\u201d All the more impressive that she worried her publishers so. But Methuen had underestimated the reading public, who made the book a bestseller when it eventually came out. Just as bad, they missed one of the most charming things about Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day: all the fun that Miss Pettigrew has is harmless. It isn\u2019t really a book about bad behaviour; it\u2019s about finding goodness. When Miss Pettigrew literally and metaphorically lets her hair down, steps out of her dowdy and threadbare governess clothes and starts hitting the sherry, she leaves behind a life that has been cruel, cold and pinched. Just after Miss Pettigrew\u2019s employment agency makes the error that sets the plot in motion, sending her to Miss LaFosse instead of a family seeking a governess, we see our hero out on the street: \u201cMiss Pettigrew joined the throng, a middle-aged, rather angular lady, of medium height, thin through lack of good food, with a timid, defeated expression and terror quite discernible in her eyes, if anyone cared to look. But there was no personal friend or relation in the whole world who knew or cared whether Miss Pettigrew was alive or dead.\u201d Wonderfully, Miss Pettigrew soon meets people who do care. Miss LaFosse is not a \u201clady\u201d and does not have much of the Christian \u201cvirtue\u201d her father demanded \u2013 but she is generous, warm and affectionate. So much so that she moves Miss Pettigrew to tears by simply asking if she is \u201call right\u201d: \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Miss Pettigrew. \u201cYou can set your mind at rest.\u201d \u201cOh you darling!\u201d Miss LaFosse leaned forward impulsively and kissed her again, and there, right on Miss Pettigrew\u2019s clasped hands, fell two drops of water and two more were trickling down her cheeks. Miss Pettigrew flushed a delicate pink.\u201d \u201cI have not,\u201d said Miss Pettigrew in humble excuse, \u201chad much affection in my life.\u201d I was almost dabbing at my own eyes at this point \u2013 and it was only chapter two. The day had barely begun. Any naughtiness that Miss Pettigrew encounters is also always nice. It\u2019s almost impossible to be scandalised. Almost. It would be dishonest to not note that there are instances of racism in the book, which might not have felt unusual in 1938, but are nonetheless abhorrent.

      "bodyText": "Emissions from diesel cars \u2013 even newer and supposedly cleaner models \u2013 increase on hot days, a new study has found, raising questions over how cities suffering from air pollution can deal with urban heat islands and the climate crisis. Research in Paris by The Real Urban Emissions (True) initiative found that diesel car emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) rose by 20% to 30% when temperatures topped 30C \u2013 a common event this summer. Emissions from a range of vehicles were found to be many times higher than those declared by manufacturers in laboratory tests, confirming earlier findings following the 2015 Dieselgate scandal, in which Volkswagen cars were found to emit 40 times more NOx on the road than during laboratory tests. Certain pollutants from motorcycles \u2013 often considered a cleaner alternative to four-wheeled vehicles \u2013 were also found to \u201cgreatly exceed\u201d averages for both petrol and diesel cars. Launching its latest report, True said it used hi-tech remote-sensing equipment to measure emissions from more than 180,000 vehicles being driven on roads in the French capital during three weeks in summer 2018. The tests, carried out with the approval of the city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, used a beam of light to analyse the exhaust plumes of vehicles as they passed, with automatic number plate recognition linking the measurement to specific models. More than 370,000 such measurements taken in the UK, France and other countries have been compiled into a new rating system by True. The vehicles were tested on three roads in Paris\u2019s 12th and 13th arrondissements \u2013 not the most central \u2013 and most were passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The sample also included buses, motorcycles, mopeds and lorries. The aim, as with a similar study in London the previous year, was to measure the real emissions of vehicles on the road in a range of different driving and traffic conditions. The latest findings will come as no surprise to Parisians, who returned to work last week after the long summer holiday. Car lobbies dismiss residents\u2019 complaints about asthma and allergies as anecdotal evidence and contest city hall\u2019s measures to discourage car use in the city centre. Hidalgo, who is seeking re-election next year, has made combating pollution in the capital a key element of her term in office. The Crit\u2019Air system was introduced, obliging all vehicles to have an anti-pollution sticker ranking how clean they are, with the dirtiest categories progressively banned from the city centre.

This came as a shock because Bahamians don\u2019t need visas to visit America if they don\u2019t have a police record and plan a short stay.

No matter who is at fault, however, this episode should leave us all very unsettled. As the climate crisis progresses, there will be more climate migrants seeking temporary or permanent reprieve. They will not be met with open arms and open borders. They will be met with no legal recognition and little protection, as they won\u2019t have refugee status. They will be met with racism.

The increase of price means an impact on the volume you sell, and would eventually lead to a reduction of produced cars in Oxford.\u201d BMW has warned that leaving the EU with no deal may force it to stop making the Mini at Cowley, endangering more than 4,500 jobs and more than 100 years of carmaking at the site. It shifted some of its engine production from the West Midlands to Germany in July. Last month BMW\u2019s chief executive, Harald Kr\u00fcger, urged Boris Johnson to find a compromise to prevent damage to the UK\u2019s businesses and economy. BMW also makes Minis in the Netherlands and Peter said the company would use production cuts as a \u201cfirst step\u201d to manage a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWhat\u2019s extremely important is to use the weeks we have before 31 October to develop and implement a constructive Brexit solution,\u201d Peter said. Johnson has hardened his language since Kr\u00fcger\u2019s remarks, claiming he is seeking a deal but ruling out any extension designed to prevent the UK leaving in a chaotic no-deal outcome. He suspended parliament on Monday after saying he would sooner \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than seek an extension from the EU. Investment in Britain\u2019s car industry, which is highly integrated with the EU, has ground to a halt as a hard Brexit looms. The amount pledged for new investments in the first half of 2019 was \u00a390m compared with between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a32.7bn a year before the Brexit vote. Car industry executives have been among the most outspoken opponents of a no-deal Brexit, which could cause the imposition of tariffs of 10% on cars and 4.5% on components imported into the EU from the UK, as well as potential delays at the border.",

      "bodyText": "A series of raids on journalists by the Australian Federal Police has tarnished Australia\u2019s standing on the world stage, the chair of the ABC Ita Buttrose says. \u201cThe AFP actions have not gone unnoticed overseas,\u201d the former editor said. \u201cIn the days following the raids the New York Times decreed that Australia may well be the world\u2019s most secretive democracy. \u201cNo other developed democracy holds as tight to its secrets,\u201d wrote the New York Times. \u201cThe raids are just the latest example of how far the country\u2019s conservative government will go to scare officials and reporters into submission.\u201d The AFP raided the public broadcaster in June over its 2017 reporting into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan, badged as \u201cThe Afghan files\u201d. The previous day the AFP had raided the home of the News Corp political editor, Annika Smethurst, over articles she wrote in 2018 on proposals to expand Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. Buttrose told the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties that the raids on News Corp and the ABC had brought the two traditional media rivals together and galvanised the wider Australian media \u201cin vociferous opposition\u201d to the AFP\u2019s actions. \u201cWho would have thought it possible?\u201d she said on Tuesday evening at the council\u2019s annual dinner. Buttrose has been a strong voice in defence of the ABC\u2019s journalism since her appointment in February, five months after the resignation of her predecessor Justin Milne. The former Australian of the Year and magazine editor rejected some commentators\u2019 views that the public didn\u2019t care about press freedom, whistleblowers and the public\u2019s right to know. \u201cI believe there is a much bigger feeling of disquiet among many Australians about the stifling of the media and the threats against whistleblowers,\u201d she said. \u201cMany Australians were deeply shocked and disturbed at the AFP raid on the ABC. \u201cThe ABC\u2019s supporters, viewers and listeners never should be underestimated. They understand that we are not seeking for anyone to be above the law but that no one in a democracy should be above scrutiny.\u201d A recent Essential poll showed that three-quarters of Australians are concerned about federal police raids on journalists and the scale of requests for telecommunications data. Buttrose said the belief that Australia has a free press had been \u201cshaken to the core\u201d recently and the Right to Know Media Coalition is working hard to convince the government that immediate law reform is vital to an independent and effective media. Two parliamentary inquiries had already been initiated as a result of the raids but we have to keep the pressure up, she said. The investigation into the leaked material is ongoing and the AFP has not ruled out attempting to prosecute Smethurst.",

A study carried out by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health calculates that the city could prevent 667 premature deaths every year if it created all 503 superblocks envisaged in its initial plan \u2013 up from the current six schemes. The superblocks are groups of streets where traffic is reduced to close to zero, with the space formerly occupied by cars given over to pedestrians and play areas. The concept is the brainchild of BCNecologia, an agency led by Salvador Rueda. The six schemes introduced so far have been generally welcomed by residents of a city whose air quality regularly exceeds the World Health Organization\u2019s legal limits for pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The report claims that creating all 503 superblocks would reduce ambient levels of NO2 by 24%, from the current level of 47 micrograms per cubic metre to 36 micrograms per cubic metre.

      "bodyText": "Extinction Rebellion has blocked the entrance to the UK\u2019s only active fracking site in a demonstration against what it called the \u201cburgeoning catastrophe\u201d of global warming. Protesters from the environmental group gathered outside the shale gas site on Preston New Road, near Blackpool, on Tuesday morning alongside a yellow boat bearing the words: \u201cPlanet before profit\u201d. The energy firm Cuadrilla said its operations were not affected by the protest. The action comes 15 days after the UK\u2019s biggest fracking-related earthquake to date was triggered at the site, causing houses to shake for miles around. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said its latest action was to highlight \u201cthe conscious, cynical inaction of the government in response to a climate and ecological emergency\u201d. They added in a statement: \u201cWe will stand with those communities which have tenaciously and peacefully resisted this for years. They have sought to defend against the threat fracking poses to their air and water, their health, their land, including their homes, as demonstrated by the recent tremors. \u201cThere is a yawning chasm between words and deeds. The science is clear: the world must move urgently away from a system of ever-increasing consumption and destruction, totally founded and dependent on fossil fuels.\u201d Fracking involves pumping water and chemicals into rocks at high pressure to extract shale gas. Fracking in England resumed last year after two tremors \u2013 measuring 2.3- and 1.5-magnitude \u2013 prompted a seven-year moratorium on the process. The Conservative government backs fracking as a way to solve the UK\u2019s energy needs and ministers are considering relaxing safeguarding rules that bring an immediate halt to fracking if even a minor tremor of magnitude 0.5 is recorded. Fracking has been paused at Preston New Road since a 2.9-magnitude tremor was recorded at the site on 26 August \u2013 the largest since the 2.3-magnitude quake brought a long halt to the process in 2011. A Cuadrilla spokesman said: \u201cWe have no objection to peaceful, law-abiding protest whilst recognising that our neighbours, motorists using the busy road and our staff and contractors should also be able to go about their business without disruption, inconvenience or intimidation.\u201d The spokesman added that shale gas \u201ccould be a very important resource for Lancashire and the UK and, whilst hydraulic fracturing is currently suspended, we would like to continue with our work to prove this\u201d.",

The current military intervention in the Middle East has lasted almost as long as world war I, world war II and the Vietnam war combined. It has gone on for too long and needs to end. Bin Laden is dead, Saddam is dead and there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Isis will only be defeated when the world calls out the<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> Milo Minderbinde</strong>r who is funding them. As Eisenhower said:</p> <p>No nation\u2019s security and wellbeing can be lastingly achieved in isolation but only in effective cooperation with fellow nations.</p> <p>Any nation\u2019s attempt to dictate to other nations their form of government is indefensible.</p> <p>Twenty-first century foreign affairs have been characterised by belligerent rhetoric and an unwillingness to seek peace through diplomatic channels. </p> <p>This needs to change. Sound diplomacy and strength of position is the foundation of peace.</p> <p>Of all the foreign policy achievements in my lifetime, none was more inspirational than Reagan and Gorbachev in ending the cold war. Their willingness to work together is the example that world leaders should follow today. As Reagan said:</p> <p>People want to raise their children in a world without fear and without war. They want to have some of the good things over and above bare subsistence that make life worth living. They want to work at some trade that gives them a sense of worth. Their common interests cross all borders.</p> <p>Australia needs to continue the good work the government is doing by building alliances with our Indo-Pacific neighbours. We are only as strong as we are united and as weak as we are divided. We also need to strengthen our defences here in Australia, using superior technology that will protect Australians and not line the pockets of vested interests.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T10:04:55.601Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d776e748f08143ee1ae3704\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T09:35:56.770Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But let us not forget universities:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Skills-based training through TAFE should take precedence over non-vocational university studies.

Yes, he is a LNP senator. As in part of the government. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australia is endowed with vast natural wealth. Yet until the last quarter, it has run current account deficits for the best part of 50 years. In the last financial year, despite a trade surplus of $50bn Australia plunged further into debt, with a current account deficit of $12bn, due to capital profits paid to off-shore entities. Because of the tax treaties, most of these profits are taxed around 10% or less, while profits, retained in Australia, are taxed at 30%.</p> <p>Our own taxation system acts as a reverse tariff on entities domiciled here in Australia sending profits and businesses off shore, because of the regulatory and taxation burden placed on them. </p> <p>The solution to this is ensure the withholding tax rate placed on profits off-shore is the same as the tax rate on profits retained in Australia. Given there is $2.8tr in super, tax concession for foreign investors needs to stop. Australia has no shortage of capital. </p> <p>... When the convicts got off the boat, all they had was their will to survive. There were no financial instruments, regulations, scoping studies or subsidies in sight. Our prosperity has come from the hands of our carpenters and mechanics, the minds of our scientists and engineers, the hearts of our teachers and nurses and most importantly, the persistence and innovation of small business owners. Yet today, financial rewards go to the paper shufflers. Bureaucrats who impose red tape, lawyers who argue semantics, fund managers who trade financial instruments, and universities who sell degrees. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T09:49:42.471Z\">at 10.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7767308f082514879f141b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T09:17:06.730Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But wait, he continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australians smell a rat when it comes to asset sales. At almost every opportunity they have rejected it. Foreign owners, superannuation funds, and corporations aren\u2019t elected. So how are they held accountable to the Australian people, if they fail to provide essential services? They aren\u2019t. And as such, privatisation undermines accountability, the bedrock of democracy.</p> <p>The sale of critical assets to off-shore entities, also undermines our security and sovereignty. Just look at the Darwin port. Neo-liberal economics at its finest. It seems ludicrous that Australian superfunds invest $580bn in offshore equities and bonds, yet critical national infrastructure has to rely on foreign capital for funding. A classic case of ideology gone mad.</p> <p>Our founding fathers, Barton, Deakin, Issacs and Higgins, all members of the protectionist party, would be turning in their graves. My forefathers left Ireland during the great famine, when powerful landowners exported wheat, rather than feed the starving population. National interest should also take precedent over vested interest. </p> <p>Most infrastructure assets are monopolies that aren\u2019t subject to competitive market forces that drive efficient outcomes. Australia\u2019s high energy prices are one example of what happens when a market is artificially manipulated to achieve a determined aim. Only 6% of superannuation is invested in infrastructure. This needs to change. Today, more than ever, governments need to build income-generating infrastructure, such as dams, power stations, rail and ports. Like Governor Macquarie, who funded an ambitious building program, through the issue of the holy dollar, a government-owned infrastructure bank should be created to do the same. Funding from infrastructure bonds and superannuation. These measures will provide essential services, employment, and fixed income for retirees.</p> <p>It is a much better option than interest rate manipulation, which only punishes savers and prospective home buyers. </p> <p>If dairy farmers can\u2019t set the price of milk to earn a fair return on their efforts, than why does the RBA, an unelected body, get to set the price of money, on behalf of money markets?

It is the optimism that inspires hard work, that turns adversary into opportunity, and convict colonies into countries.</p> <p>From humble beginnings, modern Australia has overcome immense challenges to become one of the world\u2019s great liberal democracies. Few countries epitomise the power of self-belief and the ethos of a fair go, better than Australia. A country that remains a beacon to those fleeing persecution, and are seeking a better life for themselves and their children.</p> <p>Gratitude towards our forefathers who built this nation, and in doing so, gave us so many opportunities, is what drives me to see this country continue to provide opportunities for our children.</p> <p>It is that aim that brings me here today. Of all the issues faced by Australia, few are as damaging to our country than the fiscal imbalance and ambiguous responsibilities between state and federal governments.</p> <p>You\u2019ve really got to ask why Australia, a country of 25m people, has nine growing health bureaucracies, while maternity wards are being closed in my home state of Queensland. Our constitution was designed to hold government to account by the people.</p> <p>Yet 129 years of compromise has rendered it ineffective. It is time for Coag to hold a constitutional convention, to clearly define and separate these responsibilities, with proposed changes put to a referendum. The blame game needs to end. Australians deserve accountability.</p> <p>People pay taxes in return for essential services, not more regulation. They expect governments to build infrastructure, not sell it. Yet despite this, governments have privatised much of the infrastructure which delivers those services.</p> <p>At the same time, they have marched into the family home, the bedroom and the classroom, telling people how to live their lives, parents how to raise their children and owners how to run their business. The jackboot of bureaucracy is suffocating every day choices, the very thing liberal democratic governments are meant to defend.</p> <p>Is it any wonder, people are cynical about governments when they walk away from providing services, while imposing more regulation?</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T09:31:05.363Z\">at 10.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d77616b8f083106f4558ae2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T08:41:07.420Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I am sure they have plenty to talk about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"badb0e47b691b270932f4d19058be1015e097875\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/badb0e47b691b270932f4d19058be1015e097875/0_0_3607_2405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queensland LNP Senator Gerard Rennick is congratulated by Malcolm Roberts after giving his first speech in the Senate Chamber of Parliament House, Canberra this evening.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queensland LNP Senator Gerard Rennick is congratulated by Malcolm Roberts after giving his first speech in the Senate Chamber of Parliament House, Canberra this evening.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d775e968f08143ee1ae3666\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T08:36:08.408Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Sussan Ley, </strong>says now is not the time to talk about whether or not climate change has contributed to the conditions which have caused the Queensland and NSW fires:</p> <p>\u201cI know that the climate is changing, and I know that the people I represent and rural Australians, see that every day.

I am sure it is related to climate change, to what degree and under what circumstances, and what actions we could be taking, there is a whole range of other conversations around that. I mean, people talk about controlled burnings, people talk about where your houses are - there are a lot of conversations to be had.</p> <p>You have heard me on the reef - I am not shying away from that - but it is much more than that, and for our communities which are struggling at the moment, it is not about governments and individuals talking about these issues, it is about what we do to help people in the present, on the ground and I am very happy to participate in those discussions, and again, listen to the scientists, because they are a very good source of information. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T08:40:06.949Z\">at 9.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d775e6b8f082514879f13c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T08:27:32.787Z\">9.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As expected:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBandt/status/1171338568905580544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Senate passed a fed ICAC bill yesterday.<br><br>It just came to House &amp; we cld\u2019ve made it law. <br><br>But gov didn\u2019t just refuse to deal with bill, they gagged everyone from speaking. <br><br>No ICAC, no debate about ICAC.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greens?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Greens</a> will keep fighting until there\u2019s a fed corruption watchdog.</p>&mdash; Adam Bandt (@AdamBandt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBandt/status/1171338568905580544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d775b458f082514879f139c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T08:26:12.920Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking to ABC Melbourne, <strong>Sussan Ley </strong>was asked what she says to farmers who don\u2019t accept the science around climate change (the topic was the Great Barrier Reef outlook)</p> <p>Ley reponds:</p> <p>\u201cI say that I respect the science, but I understand there is a range of science,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSo the most important thing is to inform yourself, realise ... \u201d</p> <p>What does she mean by a \u2018range of science\u2019?</p> <p>\u201cThere is a range of scientific opinion.

If the best form of welfare is a job \u2013 why punish people who work anything more than three hours a week?</p> </blockquote> <p>Lambie then noted in a further supplementary question that this amounted to an effective marginal tax rate of 50-60 cents a dollar for all income over $50 a week, much greater than the 37% income tax rate the government has decided to lower to incentivise work for working Australians.</p> <p>Ruston replied that \u201cpeople who work for a few hours are much more likely to go on and get a job\u201d and committed to discuss the issue with Lambie but did not

We\u2019ve had a change to a listing of the grasslands in the Southern Tablelands and that was a very substantial change, with potential to have a big impact on the ability of farmers in my electorate to improve their land, through pastoral improvement, which is a big deal across the Southern Tablelands and Southern Highlands. This listing had the potential to have a very big impact so I asked for a meeting to discuss this, and in particular discuss the technical aspects of the listing. There\u2019s all sorts of issues here about whether clover is treated in a particular way, and we had the meeting. Now Labor has decided that because I live and farm in the electorate, and I am a farmer, that this is unacceptable.</p> <p><strong>Presenter: </strong>They do say \u2013 I mean, you said it has the potential to have a big impact on landholders, one of those landholders being a company that is \u2013<br><br><strong>Taylor: </strong>One of the landholders is me.

I mean, look \u2013</p> <p><strong>Presenter: </strong>But a big impact on a company that is, one of the directors of which is your brother.</p> <p><strong>Taylor: </strong>Melinda, this discussion was about the technical aspects of a listing, which had the potential and still has the potential to have a very big impact on farming across the region. I make absolutely no apologies for standing up for farmers in my region. That includes me and other family members. I mean this is, you know, what my job is as a local member of parliament. It is my job to stand up for us. If I\u2019m not standing up for my farmers in the federal parliament, then who is?

Strengthening youth suicide prevention efforts. </p> <p>Back with some $19.6m to prevent Indigenous youth suicide, particularly in the Kimberley and $22.5m in youth and Indigenous health research projects as part of the million minds mission. </p> <p>These projects include almost $3m in funds for a wonderful organisation called BETIA which the member for Reid and I and the health minister had the privilege to go and see their work in action. Absolutely extraordinary stuff. We were at a girls high school together as part of that workshop. That reached 171,000 young people. </p> <p>We have appointed Christine Morgan as the national suicide prevention organiser. She has a huge job to do and she\u2019ll need our help working with state and territory leaders and their administrations. </p> <p>But most importantly on World Suicide Prevention Day we must tell Australians that if you are feeling the strain, if you are feeling the stress, if you\u2019re battling with mental illness, if you think there are things that you can\u2019t overcome, you are not alone. There is an Australian who is there to help you. And an Australian who will reach out to you and seek to support you.

We all want a roof over our head, food in our stomach and a better life for our children. What binds us together is much more than what drives us apart. We must promote a unified Australia, rather than ideologies that seek to divide us.\u201d Except, I would imagine, those who are over stocking our paddocks. And, of course, we get his view on diplomacy: Almost 20 years ago, I finished a seven-year journey around the world that took me to most corners of the globe. The Elamite [tablets] in Iran and the Aleppo souq and Palmyra ruins in Syria were some of the more spectacular places I saw. It would be almost impossible for me to travel to those places today, which is a shame. As the birthplace of writing, irrigation, astronomy, algebra and our major religions, the Middle East is the cradle of our civilisation. All war is a failure of diplomacy. The current military intervention in the Middle East has lasted almost as long as world war I, world war II and the Vietnam war combined. It has gone on for too long and needs to end. Bin Laden is dead, Saddam is dead and there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Isis will only be defeated when the world calls out the Milo Minderbinder who is funding them. As Eisenhower said: No nation\u2019s security and wellbeing can be lastingly achieved in isolation but only in effective cooperation with fellow nations. Any nation\u2019s attempt to dictate to other nations their form of government is indefensible. Twenty-first century foreign affairs have been characterised by belligerent rhetoric and an unwillingness to seek peace through diplomatic channels. This needs to change. Sound diplomacy and strength of position is the foundation of peace. Of all the foreign policy achievements in my lifetime, none was more inspirational than Reagan and Gorbachev in ending the cold war. Their willingness to work together is the example that world leaders should follow today. As Reagan said: People want to raise their children in a world without fear and without war. They want to have some of the good things over and above bare subsistence that make life worth living. They want to work at some trade that gives them a sense of worth. Their common interests cross all borders. Australia needs to continue the good work the government is doing by building alliances with our Indo-Pacific neighbours. We are only as strong as we are united and as weak as we are divided. We also need to strengthen our defences here in Australia, using superior technology that will protect Australians and not line the pockets of vested interests. But let us not forget universities: Skills-based training through TAFE should take precedence over non-vocational university studies. Too many young people are graduating from university with massive debts but no employment prospects, while business import labour to fill skills shortages. The government\u2019s incentive payment schemes for apprenticeships are a step in the right direction. Sending everybody to university has not resulted in a well-educated population. It has resulted in worthless degrees, dumbed-down standards and vast amounts of student debt. It is a sad indictment on our education system that Australia, a first world country, has to import skilled labour, especially doctors, from developing countries. There are over 600,000 foreign students studying in Australia who use infrastructure funded by the taxpayer. They can also work up to 20 hours per week, competing with unemployed Australians looking for work. It is time universities, and not the taxpayer, funded the economic cost of hosting them. Universities should also underwrite student loans, which total over $60 billion. Why should the taxpayer underwrite this without a guarantee from universities that their graduates will get a job and repay their debts? And then we get to the \u201cover stocked\u201d paddock line (despite Australia being a \u2018beacon\u2019 for people wanting a better life). Gerard Rennick: While economic growth is important, it should not come at a cost to our quality of life. It is time immigration levels were reduced so communities can deal with infrastructure, the environment and skills shortages. Despite almost a doubling of the population in the last 30 years, state governments have built very few baseload power stations or dams. They need to address declining services to everyday Australians before the population increases any further. The greatest threat to our environment is not carbon dioxide but unsustainable immigration. As the son of a farmer, I was taught from a young age about carrying capacity and never to over stock your paddocks. Yet immigration is doing just that, causing major city congestion and overdevelopment on our city fringes. Meanwhile, regional communities are struggling as opportunities, from the lack of infrastructure, go begging. While I agree with the government\u2019s wind-back of permanent visa places to 160,000 annually, the almost two million temporary visa holders living in Australia should also be reduced. And there is still more. Yes, he is a LNP senator. As in part of the government. Australia is endowed with vast natural wealth. Yet until the last quarter, it has run current account deficits for the best part of 50 years. In the last financial year, despite a trade surplus of $50bn Australia plunged further into debt, with a current account deficit of $12bn, due to capital profits paid to off-shore entities. Because of the tax treaties, most of these profits are taxed around 10% or less, while profits, retained in Australia, are taxed at 30%. Our own taxation system acts as a reverse tariff on entities domiciled here in Australia sending profits and businesses off shore, because of the regulatory and taxation burden placed on them. The solution to this is ensure the withholding tax rate placed on profits off-shore is the same as the tax rate on profits retained in Australia. Given there is $2.8tr in super, tax concession for foreign investors needs to stop. Australia has no shortage of capital. ... When the convicts got off the boat, all they had was their will to survive. There were no financial instruments, regulations, scoping studies or subsidies in sight. Our prosperity has come from the hands of our carpenters and mechanics, the minds of our scientists and engineers, the hearts of our teachers and nurses and most importantly, the persistence and innovation of small business owners. Yet today, financial rewards go to the paper shufflers. Bureaucrats who impose red tape, lawyers who argue semantics, fund managers who trade financial instruments, and universities who sell degrees. But wait, he continues: Australians smell a rat when it comes to asset sales. At almost every opportunity they have rejected it. Foreign owners, superannuation funds, and corporations aren\u2019t elected. So how are they held accountable to the Australian people, if they fail to provide essential services? They aren\u2019t. And as such, privatisation undermines accountability, the bedrock of democracy. The sale of critical assets to off-shore entities, also undermines our security and sovereignty. Just look at the Darwin port. Neo-liberal economics at its finest. It seems ludicrous that Australian superfunds invest $580bn in offshore equities and bonds, yet critical national infrastructure has to rely on foreign capital for funding. A classic case of ideology gone mad. Our founding fathers, Barton, Deakin, Issacs and Higgins, all members of the protectionist party, would be turning in their graves. My forefathers left Ireland during the great famine, when powerful landowners exported wheat, rather than feed the starving population. National interest should also take precedent over vested interest. Most infrastructure assets are monopolies that aren\u2019t subject to competitive market forces that drive efficient outcomes. Australia\u2019s high energy prices are one example of what happens when a market is artificially manipulated to achieve a determined aim. Only 6% of superannuation is invested in infrastructure. This needs to change. Today, more than ever, governments need to build income-generating infrastructure, such as dams, power stations, rail and ports. Like Governor Macquarie, who funded an ambitious building program, through the issue of the holy dollar, a government-owned infrastructure bank should be created to do the same. Funding from infrastructure bonds and superannuation. These measures will provide essential services, employment, and fixed income for retirees. It is a much better option than interest rate manipulation, which only punishes savers and prospective home buyers. If dairy farmers can\u2019t set the price of milk to earn a fair return on their efforts, than why does the RBA, an unelected body, get to set the price of money, on behalf of money markets? Why is there one rule for one industry, and not the other? Gerard Rennick, by Gerard Rennick: Self-belief is the conviction that leads to achievement. It is the optimism that inspires hard work, that turns adversary into opportunity, and convict colonies into countries. From humble beginnings, modern Australia has overcome immense challenges to become one of the world\u2019s great liberal democracies. Few countries epitomise the power of self-belief and the ethos of a fair go, better than Australia. A country that remains a beacon to those fleeing persecution, and are seeking a better life for themselves and their children. Gratitude towards our forefathers who built this nation, and in doing so, gave us so many opportunities, is what drives me to see this country continue to provide opportunities for our children. It is that aim that brings me here today. Of all the issues faced by Australia, few are as damaging to our country than the fiscal imbalance and ambiguous responsibilities between state and federal governments. You\u2019ve really got to ask why Australia, a country of 25m people, has nine growing health bureaucracies, while maternity wards are being closed in my home state of Queensland. Our constitution was designed to hold government to account by the people. Yet 129 years of compromise has rendered it ineffective. It is time for Coag to hold a constitutional convention, to clearly define and separate these responsibilities, with proposed changes put to a referendum. The blame game needs to end. Australians deserve accountability. People pay taxes in return for essential services, not more regulation. They expect governments to build infrastructure, not sell it. Yet despite this, governments have privatised much of the infrastructure which delivers those services. At the same time, they have marched into the family home, the bedroom and the classroom, telling people how to live their lives, parents how to raise their children and owners how to run their business. The jackboot of bureaucracy is suffocating every day choices, the very thing liberal democratic governments are meant to defend. Is it any wonder, people are cynical about governments when they walk away from providing services, while imposing more regulation? I am sure they have plenty to talk about. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, says now is not the time to talk about whether or not climate change has contributed to the conditions which have caused the Queensland and NSW fires: \u201cI know that the climate is changing, and I know that the people I represent and rural Australians, see that every day. Now when there is an emergency of this sort, and people are worried about losing their homes, to have these high-level discussions about these issues, perhaps we leave them for another day and focus on helping people right here, right now. Q: You don\u2019t think the fires have anything to do with climate change? Ley: Look, my honest answer to that is I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what caused this particular fire on this particular day ... Q: I am not asking about an individual fire - the science is pretty clear though isn\u2019t it, climate change leads to more fires and more intense fires. Ley: We have always lived on a continent which has been ravaged by fires, I am not going to become an expert on what is causing the fires. Q: I don\u2019t want to misrepresent you - are you saying the bushfires and the intensity and the frequency of the bushfires has nothing to do with climate change? Ley: I am certainly not saying that ... I am sure it is related to climate change, to what degree and under what circumstances, and what actions we could be taking, there is a whole range of other conversations around that. I mean, people talk about controlled burnings, people talk about where your houses are - there are a lot of conversations to be had. You have heard me on the reef - I am not shying away from that - but it is much more than that, and for our communities which are struggling at the moment, it is not about governments and individuals talking about these issues, it is about what we do to help people in the present, on the ground and I am very happy to participate in those discussions, and again, listen to the scientists, because they are a very good source of information. As expected: Speaking to ABC Melbourne, Sussan Ley was asked what she says to farmers who don\u2019t accept the science around climate change (the topic was the Great Barrier Reef outlook) Ley reponds: \u201cI say that I respect the science, but I understand there is a range of science,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the most important thing is to inform yourself, realise ... \u201d What does she mean by a \u2018range of science\u2019? \u201cThere is a range of scientific opinion. As we know, scientists, as the conscience of the natural world, they test hypothesis, they draw conclusions and you know, they speak freely and that is fine, and that is why I wanted to talk to scientists when I went to the reef.\u201d On cutting emissions, given they keep going up, Ley says: \u201cOur policy around emissions belongs to my colleague, Angus Taylor, he\u2019s mapped out every tonne of the 328m tonnes of abatement that we have said we will make before our 2030 targets. \u201c ... We will make our commitments, we know that, we have committed to that and we stand behind that.\u201d Asked to explain how Taylor has \u201cmapped out every tonne\u201d, Ley says: \u201c ... My language is simply to assure people that is our plan, that is what we are doing and I am very confident that we will get there.\u201d Asked when more detail will come from the government, Ley says: \u201cI am the minister for the environment, Angus Taylor is the minister for energy and emissions. I am not going to be drawn into his space when it comes to the detail of this and the reason is, yes, climate change is real, it is a real threat to the reef, rising sea temperatures are a result, intense cyclonic disturbances, coral bleaching and so on. \u201cWe have our international commitments and they are well known and well spoken off. What I am doing, is being incredibly busy, with actions on the ground.\u201d Ley says it is not all \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d and to visit the reef. Gerard Rennick is using his first speech to call for a cut in immigration, saying as the son of a farmer he was always taught not to \u201cover stock your paddocks\u201d. \u201cThere are over 600,000 foreign students studying in Australia, who use infrastructure funded by the Australian taxpayer,\u201d he says. He adds that international students can also work up to 20 hours a week, competing with Australians for work. And he wants universities to guarantee (from the sound of it) that graduates will get jobs and therefore be able to pay back their student debt. Coooooooooool. Adam Bandt is attempting to bring on the debate for the federal Icac bill the Senate passed. Christian Porter is moving to delay the debate (which is a way the government can just park it out of sight for as long as it wants) Labor will side with the Greens on this, but they do not have the numbers. Regarding Paul Karp\u2019s report that several government MPs have raised concerns in the party room about soaring premiums in North Queensland, the ACCC has been inquiring into this since May 2017. This has been on the government\u2019s radar for a while so it\u2019s puzzling if no action has been taken. In December the ACCC said \u201cimmediate action\u201d was required. And at the end of July it released an updated report containing a raft of recommendations. It looks like the Greens bill for a federal Icac which passed the Senate yesterday, after One Nation didn\u2019t turn up for the vote, is on its way to the House. Speaking of decision-makers, Gerard Rennick will deliver his first speech, as a LNP senator, just before 6pm today. Rennick won from the third spot on the ticket, which, after Labor\u2019s dismal Queensland showing, gave him the seat. He is (so far) most notorious for this social media post So once again, yes. It does matter if our leaders believe in manmade climate change or not. Does it really matter if a minister has \u201cno idea\u201d whether climate change is manmade or not? Yes. Yes it does. Because ministers are involved in coming up with the policies to tackle climate change. They are the ones who have direct influence on how our country moves forward on this. So it bloody well does matter. Here\u2019s that whole exchange, for those who missed it. David Speers: You say the climate is changing and that is certainly true - the question is, is this man-made climate change. David Littleproud: I have no idea, but does it really matter? DS: Sorry, you have no idea whether ... DL: I am not a scientist, I haven\u2019t made an opinion one way or the other, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. DS: Sorry, I just want to be really clear on this - you are not sure whether man-made climate change is real. DL: I am going to be honest with you - I don\u2019t have an opinion, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. I think these extremes from both sides have taken away the maturity of debate we should have about keeping, simply, a clean environment and making sure we give our people the tools they [need to address it] David Littleproud is on Sky News, and admits that he has never seen fires this early before. He also says that is because the \u201cclimate is changing\u201d and that we have to adapt. Yes. \u201cThe question is, is this manmade climate change,\u201d David Speers says. \u201cI have no idea, but does it really matter,\u201d Littleproud says. He says he is not a scientist, so he is going to be honest and admit he has no idea. Then the bells ring, saving him from having to expand further. When a possum met a koala Bill Shorten finishes on this, when asked about some of the \u2018bitch and fold\u2019 fights happening within caucus: I never commented on the caucus matters on or off the record. Let me answer your question. There were a couple of parts in your well-crafted question. The first thing is, I\u2019m not going to comment about what is said in caucus on or off the record. In terms of the farm bill, I don\u2019t feel Labor had any choice but to support it. There are a lot of farmers out there who feel anxious that somehow their livelihoods are being targeted by militant protesters. Whether or not this bill has any unintended consequences of dampening media analysis on the right to know, I think that is an important debate which Labor is having with the government. We\u2019re not going to get wedged about whether we like farmers or not. We like farmers. And on the critique his opposition was \u2018too left wing\u2019: Again, I\u2019m happy to talk to individuals but I\u2019m proud of the policies we took, but I accept that we were unsuccessful. I think that the process by which Labor is embarking on now is the correct process. We will have to look at what policies we keep and don\u2019t keep. I want to thank the people who voted for us, and acknowledge the people who didn\u2019t that Labor needs to heed the lessons about why you did not vote for us. I\u2019m sure that Labor will be very competitive at the next election. In the meantime, there are people who want to see Labor stand up and fight for our values and that is what we\u2019re doing every day. In my area, in terms of making sure that carers and people living with profound and severe disabilities, I will make sure you get a fair go, a better go than you have been getting. When it comes to robodebt and some of the, I think, very unfair and harsh conduct being meted out to Australian citizens by the government, I\u2019m going to help fight to make sure you get your justice. Bill Shorten is the guest on Afternoon Briefing today. Patricia Karvelas asks him about Wayne Swan\u2019s intervention (keep the policies, change the communication) and says this: I think everyone is entitled to their opinion in the wake of the very disappointing election loss. Understand a lot of people have a lot to say and I respect the right of people to have their opinions. For myself, there is a review process. We will work out what policies to jettison, what to keep, what lessons to learn. I don\u2019t want to contribute any further to that. I understand that unity is important and I think the opposition is absolutely trying to put its best foot forward. I do share a lot of disappointment at the election result, I accept my part in the responsibility of it. Also, look at the economy now and think, this is the time when the government should be helping stimulate expenditure, so that we can build the productivity-lifting infrastructure that we need. We need to reform and I believe in my areas, this government has no plan. We really need to get the national disability insurance scheme, those packages of support for profoundly and severely disabled people, those need to be provided to the people. We need to take the bureaucracy out of the system. And on robodebt, this is a government that was happy to spend hundreds of millions of dollars before an election pumping up their own tyres but are setting and engaging in a form of government extortion of its own citizens demanding they pay back money and won\u2019t even tell people how they incurred the debt. Asked about Mark Butler, he says the same thing, \u201ceveryone is entitled to their opinion\u201d. Siiiiiggggggggghhhhhh From Paul Karp: Australia\u2019s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, has said that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow if climate change is manmade\u201d. Clarifying earlier comments that the question is \u201cirrelevant\u201d when considering the Coalition government\u2019s response to intensifying bushfires, he told Guardian Australia he was unsure about the causes of the climate crisis but wanted to give the country the tools to adapt. ... Asked by Guardian Australia why he had avoided taking a position on the effect of manmade climate change, Littleproud replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if climate change is manmade. \u201cI\u2019m about practical outcomes, whether that\u2019s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt,\u201d he said. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie went on a tear in Senate question time about the rate of Newstart, citing the quarter of a million people stuck on the payment for more than a year who \u201cgo to job interviews on foot because they can\u2019t afford a bus ticket, and turn up in the same shirt because they can\u2019t afford a new one\u201d. Asked why the Coalition won\u2019t raise the rate to help people get off Newstart into work, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, replied it was \u201cnot just the safety net payment\u201d that is relevant, but also the government\u2019s record in creating 1.4m jobs. Ruston said the government is committed to creating \u201cpathways\u201d to connect people to jobs. Lambie: It sounds like I won\u2019t hold my breath for you to raise the rate of Newstart then. What about raising the threshold they can earn? Currently [Newstart recipients] can only earn about $50 a week before their payments are reduced. If the best form of welfare is a job \u2013 why punish people who work anything more than three hours a week? Lambie then noted in a further supplementary question that this amounted to an effective marginal tax rate of 50-60 cents a dollar for all income over $50 a week, much greater than the 37% income tax rate the government has decided to lower to incentivise work for working Australians. Ruston replied that \u201cpeople who work for a few hours are much more likely to go on and get a job\u201d and committed to discuss the issue with Lambie but did not commit to consider raising the threshold. \u201cObviously this government doesn\u2019t see the reduction [of the Newstart payment] is a tax in the same way as a tax of someone on a wage,\u201d she said. Also an insight into what my brain looks like after that: Peter Dutton moves to try and read an opinion piece on Kristina Keneally\u2019s methods in taking on the shadow home affairs portfolio, but the lickspittle which was asked did not include my favourite and yours \u2018do you know of any alternatives\u2019 and because it doesn\u2019t, Tony Smith tells him to stop. Dutton challenges him, which is a brave move, because even I, who has what has been termed by several of my past teachers as \u2018a slight issue with authority\u2019, probably wouldn\u2019t speak over the Speaker (one more reason I will never be in parliament). Smith prevails, because he is the boss of all procedure, and Dutton moves on, but it is not the same. Expect \u2018alternative approaches\u2019 to be back with a vengeance tomorrow, as sure as potato follows meat and veg. Nope. One more lickspittle so we can all hear how safe (and consistent) we are. We finish with the divisions. And probably also question time. Let\u2019s see. Meanwhile, from AAP: Imogen Bunting is hoping for a \u201cmiracle\u201d this week. The Brisbane mum is in Canberra, along with other welfare recipients from interstate, to try to meet with federal MPs and senators to lobby for a raise to Newstart payments. For Ms Bunting \u2013 homeless and on welfare \u2013 the miracle would be an immediate $160 per week raise to Newstart payments. Her visit, a trip sponsored by activist group GetUp, comes as the government is negotiating with crossbenchers to expand the cashless welfare card program and trial drug testing of welfare recipients. \u201cDo we care for human rights?\u201d Ms Bunting said. Australian Unemployed Workers Union campaigner Jeremy Poxon said they had tried to meet with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Social Services Minister Anne Ruston, but both had declined. He said unemployed people were \u201cshafted\u201d by the government and blamed for their own poverty. \u201cWe\u2019re here in Canberra, we\u2019re not taking these attacks lying down,\u201d Mr Poxon said. \u201cFor too long decisions have been made about our lives in Canberra ... we\u2019re here to change all that.\u201d Four years ago, Ms Bunting was moved off the Parenting Payment and onto Newstart, meaning she had to raise her then-teenage son on $530 per fortnight. Her son, now 20, has moved out of home but Ms Bunting is still struggling, she says. She\u2019s homeless, has her belongings stored in a shed and can only find work for two days a week. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of a society that would put me in this position,\u201d she said. She says the cashless welfare could be the last straw, stigmatising her and limiting her economic freedoms. Side note \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen an earless dragon in the wild. From Mike Bowers to you. Mark Butler: \u201cThis prime minister has chosen the witless minister over the earless dragon,\u201d but he too is then shut down. Christian Porter, who has caught on to the make a really quick sledge before getting to the point, so Hansard records it game, says something about Aldi bags and moves Butler no longer be heard. Our video peeps, who are much more talented than I, have been working on doing these up for you, for a while, to bring you a bit more of what is happening in question time, for those of you not so enamoured with my comparisons to unseasoned chicken wings and white bread. Terri Butler makes mention of the \u201cearless dragon\u201d being a threatened species, as she tries to move forward Labor\u2019s motion, but she is shut down, and we go back to the division. The government wins by five. Tony Burke moves to try to continue Labor\u2019s suspension, by seconding the original motion and referring to Angus Taylor as \u201cthe one threatened species in Parliament House today\u201d but Christian Porter moves he no longer be heard. The bells ring again, but no one is changing their seats, meaning the government will win this one too. The House has divided. There is no way Labor can win this. Here is how we got to this point. Anthony Albanese moves to suspend standing orders, in order to move a censure motion against Angus Taylor. Anthony Albanese moves to put forward a motion, but it\u2019s not his time. Stuart Robert fills in the time while we wait. Oof. Things just got nasty. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to the energy and emissions reduction minister\u2019s failure to put the ... interest ahead of his own interests, his family to declare his interests to the department, his failure to declare his interests to this House and his admission that he was representing his own private interests. Will the prime minister do what he should have done weeks ago and sack this minister? Morrison: Well, Mr Speaker, that would have to be the lamest build-up I have seen to that type of a question in this place before. But, Mr Speaker, not only is every assertion that he\u2019s just put to this place totally and absolutely false, Mr Speaker, but the Liberal party and the National party will not be lectured by someone who used to work in the New South Wales branch of the Labor party. He had a desk in the office, Mr Speaker, in the Sussex Street headquarters of a party that stinks with corruption, where they get money in plastic bags and count it out on the table. ... Mr Speaker, he is a member of the branch of the New South Wales Labor party where his colleague in the other place think it is only thing. You don\u2019t want me to talk about this? You don\u2019t want this on the table? Anthony Albanese: Yes, Mr Speaker. He was state director of a party that has 10 people resign. Tony Smith: Members on both sides. That was not a point of order, that was a statement. The prime minister has the call. Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. With the number of Labor party members from the New South Wales division who used to serve in Senator Kristina Keneally\u2019s former government, they\u2019re in jail, you could establish a branch at the Silverwater prison of the Labor party, and the member for Watson would know about it because one of the people who went to prison was Eddie Obeid who he used to visit when he bends the knee come winter. ... I will not cop lectures on integrity from the New South Wales Labor party, Mr Speaker. ... That mob, Mr Speaker, stinks with corruption as we see it every single day in the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which has your state\u2019s secretary right under their gaze. And this is one of the previous answers Angus Taylor gave when last asked about this in the last sitting week in July: Terri Butler: My question is to the minister for energy and emissions reduction. Was a compliance officer from the department of environment present at the meeting, referred to in his previous answer, with departmental officials about the listing of critically endangered grasslands in the Monaro region affecting land he part owned? Angus Taylor: Thank you for the question. This is a grubby smear from those opposite, one of many that have been made, and were made during the election campaign, and I have been very clear on this. This was not a discussion about compliance action. It was a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the EPBC Act. And the secretary of the department has made very clear \u2013 and I quote: \u2018I can be very clear that minister Taylor has never raised the issue.\u2019 This is the point. I make no apology, though, Mr Speaker. I make no apology for acting in the interests of the farmers in my electorate, and it\u2019s about time that those opposite stood up for the farmers in their electorates. The transcript of the local ABC radio interview Labor is referring to, is this one, from 26 July. Presenter: You certainly were the target, pretty much the one and only target of the opposition this week in the parliament \u2013 what do you think that was about? Taylor: Well, I\u2019ve been sticking up for farmers in my electorate, Melinda. We\u2019ve had a change to a listing of the grasslands in the Southern Tablelands and that was a very substantial change, with potential to have a big impact on the ability of farmers in my electorate to improve their land, through pastoral improvement, which is a big deal across the Southern Tablelands and Southern Highlands. This listing had the potential to have a very big impact so I asked for a meeting to discuss this, and in particular discuss the technical aspects of the listing. There\u2019s all sorts of issues here about whether clover is treated in a particular way, and we had the meeting. Now Labor has decided that because I live and farm in the electorate, and I am a farmer, that this is unacceptable. Presenter: They do say \u2013 I mean, you said it has the potential to have a big impact on landholders, one of those landholders being a company that is \u2013 Taylor: One of the landholders is me. I\u2019m a farmer, so are many, many people in my electorate and many people who\u2019ll be listening to your broadcast right now. I mean, look \u2013 Presenter: But a big impact on a company that is, one of the directors of which is your brother. Taylor: Melinda, this discussion was about the technical aspects of a listing, which had the potential and still has the potential to have a very big impact on farming across the region. I make absolutely no apologies for standing up for farmers in my region. That includes me and other family members. I mean this is, you know, what my job is as a local member of parliament. It is my job to stand up for us. If I\u2019m not standing up for my farmers in the federal parliament, then who is? You know I feel very strongly about this and all local members, I mean this is what local members should do. Angus Taylor: I was representing farmers in my electorate and \u2013 at a time of drought like this, you should show some respect ... for those representing farmers in their electorate. ... What I find most interesting, Mr Speaker, is those ... .... Thank you, Mr Speaker. What I find most interesting is those opposite come into this place, lecturing us about good governance whilst the stench of corruption emanates from Sussex Street. What complete hypocrisy. Tony Burke to Angus Taylor: Can the minister confirm that so far he\u2019s told the House he was representing an unknown number of unnamed farmers inside and outside his electorate, who wrote a letter to someone else three years before the meeting, someone who wrote a letter to another someone else six months after the meeting and the mysterious bloke from Yass. Why won\u2019t the minister admit to the House what he told local radio that, he\u2019s actually been representing himself the entire time? Christian Porter again makes a point of order, but Tony Smith allows it. Please sign Melissa McIntosh up for the same microphone lessons Josh Frydenberg needs. Christian Porter tries to stop the question, but Tony Smith allows it. Angus Taylor: As it happens I have a transcript of that interview with me. And at that interview \u2013 I\u2019ll read from the transcript. I\u2019m quoting myself here. \u201cI make absolutely no apologies for standing up for farmers in my region. I make no apologies. If I\u2019m not standing up for farmers in the federal parliament then who is? I mean, that is what local members do.\u201d Mr Speaker, the point I was making was that me and my family are farmers in my electorate, are farmers in my electorate, and it pains me to remind those opposite that this is a representative democracy. That\u2019s what it is, standing up for your members, standing up for your constituents is what local members should do. ...Even though most of us, with a few exceptions, live in our electorates, Mr Speaker. Now, Mr Speaker, Labor is accusing me and my family of the heinous crime of being farmers in my electorate. Well, they turn a blind eye to the literal bags of cash being laundered through Sussex Street. What utter hypocrisy! Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer the minister to his previous answer. Can the minister confirm he has been representing himself on the grasslands all along and told ABC radio Illawarra on 26 July that one of the landholders is me and \u2018I make absolutely no apologies for standing up for farmers in my region, that includes me.\u2019 The chamber is in uproar. Tony Smith does his best John Bercow to calm them down. A Dan Tehan lickspittle interrupts where we are going with this. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: My question is to the minister for energy and emissions reduction. Does the minister stand by his claim in the House that he intervened in the grasslands matter in the interests of his constituents? Taylor: Of course, yes. Yes. Yes, I always act in the interests of my constituents. Oh, in news that will surprise no one, especially women, Josh Frydenberg has acknowledged that the gender pay gap has not closed, as he asserted on Monday. He said it is at a record low. That\u2019s about 14%. Huzzah. Now back to my knitting. We get a bit of back and forth, but the question is allowed. Angus Taylor: I\u2019ve been clear that my indirect interest in the delegate farm was declared to the parliament in accordance with the rules. Now, I have always been clear that the discussions with the respect were to focus on the technical aspects of the revised listing and they did. And I advised the then minister of the compliance matter and the need to avoid any discussion of the matter. Now, the department confirmed at a Senate hearing that this approach was completely [appropriate]. So let\u2019s be clear. I declared my interest. The department already knew of the relationship and the meeting didn\u2019t discuss the compliance matter. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s previous answer in which he claimed he had declared his interest in Jam Land according to the rules. How does the minister explain on FOI decision by his department on 23 August 2019 and the answer to a question on notice from his department also dated August 2019 which state it has no record of any declaration by the minister. Let the point of orders begin. Has someone told Josh Frydenberg that the Liberals won the election yet? Could someone get around to that, right after they show him how a microphone works? Perhaps with charades? Or an interpretative dance? For an example on how these questions should actually work, here is the question from Rebekha Sharkie: In April this year the government announced funding to equip every men\u2019s shed with a portable defibrillator. There are over 900 men\u2019s sheds in Australia and more than a dozen are in my electorate, including one eagerly awaiting the rollout. Could the minister please provide the House an accurate time line on when the government will make good on the promise to ensure that every men\u2019s shed has this vital piece of life-saving equipment installed? Greg Hunt: ... We recently announced $11m for the men\u2019s shed program that included an expansion of men\u2019s sheds. It also includes additional support for existing men\u2019s sheds and $2m for the men\u2019s shed defibrillator program. My department is currently carrying out a survey of needs around the country. We expect that to be completed over the course of the coming months, and my request of them and my confident prediction to the House is that we will have these defibrillators rolling out early in the new year. I would like to pass on my thanks to those in the Yankalilla men\u2019s shed. It\u2019s a fine town, but please pass on our thanks to them and to indicate that we are looking to make sure that every men\u2019s shed in the country is equipped with a defibrillator. James Stevens, the new Christopher Pyne, takes the lead in Lickspittle of the day. #deathtodixers Linda Burney to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Only months ago the government promised that a million pensioners will get an $800 bonus from changes to deeming rates. Can you confirm that only 191 pensioner couples will receive $800. How can the prime minister explain this broken promise? Josh Frydenberg gets the nod: I thank the member for Barton for her question. I can confirm that under these new deeming rates affected pensioners will receive up to $40.50 extra a fortnight for couples, which is above $1,000. And up to $31 extra a fortnight for singles, that is $804. On average a couple receiving the aged pension can expect to receive $314 a year extra and a single can expect $250 extra. Now, Mr Speaker, the cost of these changes to the deeming rates was $600m to the budget. And it will benefit around 1 million people but, as you know, there are two deeming rates. There\u2019s a lower deeming rate and an upper deeming rate, and the member opposite should acquaint herself with the facts. That question was sparked by this Samantha Maiden story in the New Daily. From that brief moment of togetherness, we go back into questions on the economy. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: In the face of skyrocketing cost of living pressures on Australian households can the treasurer confirm that this government has presided over the worst wages growth on record? Frydenberg: I thank the member for Rankin for his question. I can confirm to the House that the wages price index, which is the for wages growth, grew by 2.3% for the year. This was just behind our budget forecast of 2.5 %. But, importantly, the wages bill for the economy, the wages bill for the economy, was 4.5% for 2018-19. Which was above our budget forecast of 4.25%. Now, Mr Speaker, the member for Rankin should be aware that wages growth fell by 1.6% under the Labor party, Mr Speaker.\u201d It goes on, but it involves yelling, and the transcriber can\u2019t cope with it, and neither can I. Anthony Albanese on that same question: I associate Labor with all of the comments of the prime minister on this very important day, and I say that we support all of the government\u2019s initiatives in this regard and stand ready to support in a bipartisan way any further initiatives that are needed to rid this scourge from our society. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636 Julian Leeser gets the first dixer. I note that today is World Suicide Prevention Day. Will the prime minister please update the House about how the Morrison government is investing in improving the mental health of Australians and suicide prevention? You can read about why this is an issue personal to him, here. Scott Morrison: Speaking at the breakfast this morning, I had the sad duty to inform those who were there of a letter I had recently received from a mum in western Sydney. I had attended the wedding with Jenny of a friend and at that wedding we had had a photo together of her and her husband and the three children. At the front of the photo was a bright, beaming young boy, Luke, who has been yet another young Australian who has taken his own life in the last 12 months. This is a curse on our country. It\u2019s a curse that together all of us in this place I think are absolutely determined to break. I want to thank all of those in this House for the support they give to the very worthy goal we have of a towards zero initiative on youth suicide and on suicide more generally. More than 3,000 Australians took their lives in 2017. We have invested some $503m in the youth mental health and suicide prevention plan, that is the largest suicide pre-investigation plan any government has ever put into practice. $375m to expand and improve frontline Headspace services. 20 new Headspace sites for rural and regional Australia. New health and telehealth services. $12m to support parents and their children including helping parents recognise when their children are [in distress]. The funding of new mental health support services through our community health and hospitals program. Strengthening youth suicide prevention efforts. Back with some $19.6m to prevent Indigenous youth suicide, particularly in the Kimberley and $22.5m in youth and Indigenous health research projects as part of the million minds mission. These projects include almost $3m in funds for a wonderful organisation called BETIA which the member for Reid and I and the health minister had the privilege to go and see their work in action. Absolutely extraordinary stuff. We were at a girls high school together as part of that workshop. That reached 171,000 young people. We have appointed Christine Morgan as the national suicide prevention organiser. She has a huge job to do and she\u2019ll need our help working with state and territory leaders and their administrations. But most importantly on World Suicide Prevention Day we must tell Australians that if you are feeling the strain, if you are feeling the stress, if you\u2019re battling with mental illness, if you think there are things that you can\u2019t overcome, you are not alone. There is an Australian who is there to help you. And an Australian who will reach out to you and seek to support you. I implore anyone in these circumstances, expressing that distress, to call Lifeline 131144 and other frontline service providers and I thank all of them for the amazing work they do to help their fellow Australians. Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636 OK. We are into the questions. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison on....... The economy! Snaps for everyone. \u201cIf the economy is going as well as he claims why do business confidence and conditions numbers get worse again today and why are they well below the long-term average?\u201d Morrison: I\u2019m pleased to know that the confidence figures remain on the positive side of the ledger and they remain on the positive side of the ledger despite ... the very complex and difficult challenges that the Australian economy faces. Now, unlike the leader of the opposition, the Labor party, who have taken to talk down the economy. ... What we can see on this side of the House is the opportunity in the Australian economy and the way forward for the Australian economy. And the way you take the Australian economy forward is you don\u2019t hold it down with higher taxes, Mr Speaker, that crush the spirit of Australians because the Labor party still holds on to $387bn of taxes they want to still put on the Australian economy. ... Now, Mr Speaker, I can hear those opposite who are saying that\u2019s not the case. ... Well, Mr Speaker, when are they going to let the Australian people in on the secret about what their view is on taxes? Albanese: I remind the prime minister that by definition that implies he\u2019s the government leader and he needs to be relevant. It asked about government policy, nothing to do with Labor. I know he\u2019s obsessed but it\u2019s about the economy, business confidence and what the government is doing about it. Morrison comes back, but he again talks about Labor. So whether it\u2019s the Setka sit in Victoria, the walkout of WA factions in Western Australia, the corruption we\u2019re seeing in the New South Wales Labor party, the leader of the opposition is presiding over a party that is chaos and confusion and even corruption, Mr Speaker. There was a baby Tasmanian devil in parliament and no one told me. Over in the Senate and it looks like the government has adopted some Greens amendments, but forward by Mehreen Faruqi, on a live export bill. The amendments insert a much-needed focus on animal welfare into the bill, which had previously not been mentioned at all,\u201d Faruqi said. The amendments change the objects of the Act to introduce a requirement to consider animal welfare and amend clause 10 of the bill to specifically provide that the Inspector-General must consider the welfare of animals as part of their reviews. But first we start with a condolence motion for Jim Forbes \u2013 the last surviving minister from the Menzies government. It is the downhill stretch to question time. Will the Lickspittles (dixer questions) be as terrible as we have come to expect? Time will tell. For the people up the back, who missed the post a few weeks (months, who can say) ago \u2013 James Ashby\u2019s ban on entering parliament has expired and he has been back in the building for some time. Here is what Anne Rushton had to say on how many people the government estimates would need the $65,000 rehabilitation support it is putting forward as part of its push to have its drug testing welfare recipient bill passed: In estimating how we put that package together we estimate between two and 3% of the 5,000 people tested are likely to fail the second test, or test positive for the second test. We hope it is lower than that, that is what we have estimated. And estimating that number, we decided to set aside an amount of money that we thought was more than adequate, probably generous, to be able to provide the services for those two or 3%. Making sure, if, for some reason, disappointingly we saw a higher number of people, return positive the second time, we would have those additional resources set aside. The amount was an extrapolation of the estimated number, it is not a limit, it just was an extrapolation. What will the money do? Provide the individualised service to the individual who tested positive the second time so we can case manage them individually. As we know everybody presents in a different way and will require a different set of services. Some require a small amount of intervention, others may take quite a long time. The second area is to make sure we have the resources to be able to provide to the providers within these regions, so if they need to beef up their facilities and resources to meet an increase in demand, they will be able to do that. The third pool of money we set aside will be to make sure, if for a particular reason those resources aren\u2019t able to be upscaled quickly enough, we can buy in the additional resources. We want to make sure anybody who is testing positive twice and requires this assistance will be able to access it. I probably should have put this up earlier, but following on from Labor\u2019s attack this week, that the government needs to stop looking at ways to wedge Labor and run the country, Graham Perrett came up with a new term last night during one of the debates: I rise to speak on the fair work laws amendment (proper use of worker benefits) bill 2019. It is yet another Orwellian nomenclature from the ministry of truth opposite \u2013 unbelievable! This isn\u2019t legislation; this is \u201cwedgislation\u201d. I mean, fair dinkum, we\u2019ve dealt with this before, yet here it is back again. What do we have? We have a government focused on union bashing \u2013 that\u2019s their favourite pastime \u2013 rather than actually looking after the national economy and the best interests of the nation. Those opposite don\u2019t care about the terrible conditions that employees have to put up with. No, they\u2019re trying to wrap the representatives of working Australians in red tape so that they can\u2019t actually do their job. Equality Australia and Democracy in Colour have presented a petition to shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus and Greens senator Janet Rice calling for a fair and balanced religious discrimination law, after backlash against the Coalition\u2019s exposure draft bill. The Greens are clear they can\u2019t support the current bill but Dreyfus avoided expressing a personal opinion: This is an exposure draft ... It\u2019s far too early to adopt a definitive position in respect of any of this bill simply because it\u2019s not clear that the government will be proceeding with what\u2019s in the exposure draft. In fact if you listen carefully to things the attorney general has said publicly about this, I think it seems highly likely the government is contemplating a change ... we will wait and see what the government finally presents to parliament, when that occurs.\u201d But Dreyfus\u2019 frontbench colleagues have not been nearly so circumspect: Michelle Rowland and Joel Fitzgibbon have suggested Labor should consider supporting it, Chris Bowen is working behind the scenes for that outcome. Tanya Plibersek has warned that overriding state discrimination law would be a \u201creal problem\u201d with the legislation and Penny Wong has also expressed concerns. Dreyfus said his colleagues had simply noted comments by \u201cmany different groups pointing to problems\u201d with the bill, but Labor hasn\u2019t got a final position yet. Labor MPs have decided to back the government\u2019s new agricultural protection bill - known as the \u201cvegan terrorists\u201d bill \u2013 despite three MPs speaking against it. Kim Carr was the most vocal opponent, raising concerns about the party \u201ccapitulating\u201d to the government. Penny Wong hit back at the suggestion, saying the argument \u201cthat we are capitulating on major issues is a Greens tactic and we must take it on\u201d. Albanese also spoke about the Labor party\u2019s direction and the review process under way, saying that \u201cif you do the same thing in politics, you will get the same outcomes\u201d. The Intelligence and Security Committee have determined what is a terrorist organisation for this point in 2019. From its statement: The Intelligence and Security Committee today tabled its report supporting regulations listing and re-listing groups, such as Islamic State-Somalia, as terrorist organisations under the criminal code. The committee reviewed the process for listing terrorist organisations and the information provided to the minister for home affairs in support of regulations affecting the listings, which must demonstrate that, each group: is directly, or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act; or that they advocated the doing of a terrorist act. The committee\u2019s report, review of the listing of Islamic State-Somalia and the re-listing of Abu Sayyaf Group, al-Qa\u2019ida, al-Qa\u2019ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and Jemaah Islamiyah as terrorist organisations under the criminal code, asserts that appropriate processes had been followed in the listing of these groups and that each group meets the definition of a terrorist organisation under the criminal code. The committee\u2019s chair, Mr Andrew Hastie MP, said the PJCIS had an important role in the oversight of terrorist organisation listings, as individuals whom engage with listed organisations may be charged with serious offences including: being a member of a terrorist organisation, recruiting on behalf of a terrorist organisation, or getting funds to or from a terrorist organisation. Andrew Leigh has responded to Ken Henry\u2019s comments (unsurprisingly, since they go to Labor\u2019s current attack on the government in regards to the economy). Ken Henry\u2019s excoriating views on the state of public policy today reflect the Morrison government\u2019s rudderless drift. The Morrison government is the dog that caught the car, and doesn\u2019t know what to do next. Australia faces massive challenges \u2013 from inequality to productivity, climate change to wage stagnation \u2013 and yet the fresh thinking that used to characterise policymaking is sadly lacking from the Coalition.\u201d Former Treasury boss Ken Henry has had a few things to say, according to this report from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age\u2019s Shane Wright: Australian politicians are failing the nation by ignoring the advice of experts, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry has claimed, warning large numbers of people could miss out on a job because of their deliberate ignorance. In excoriating comments to a small gathering of MPs and social scientists in Canberra on Tuesday, Dr Henry said governments were claiming success for policies that had not fixed the problem they were developed to confront. ...Dr Henry also cited poor quality infrastructure that had led to congested major cities unable to deal with the fastest population growth in the developed world and wide-scale cases of environmental degradation including the \u201cunsustainable and environmentally damaging water usage in the Murray-Darling basin\u201d. Jacqui Lambie has responded to Pauline Hanson\u2019s comments from a little earlier today (Hanson questioned why Lambie would reject the government\u2019s welfare drug-testing proposal, given her family\u2019s personal experience with drug addiction). The parliamentary bells are ringing, meaning the official proceedings are about to get under way. The parties have met for their regular meetings and have all emerged. We\u2019ll let you know what went on when we hear more. Doesn\u2019t seem to have been too much drama in the joint party room, beyond \u201chow good is [insert noun here]\u201d. Going back through the Pauline Hanson interview with Sky News and the One Nation leader seems to get a bit personal here, with her critique of Jacqui Lambie\u2019s rejection of the drug-testing policy. Lambie has been open about her son\u2019s battles with drug addiction and what that did to their family. That\u2019s also given her a first-hand experience with drug rehabilitation services, and said that has guided her \u2013 that she knows, for instance, that people needing rehabilitation in Tasmania are sent out of state, because the services are just not there. Lambie has said she won\u2019t look at supporting the legislation until more services are in place. Asked about that, Hanson said: \u201cShe should be the first one then to say, yes I want it, because I want my child off drugs. So what is the issue here?\u201d Outside the Sky studios, Hanson expanded on that, saying she believed that it would \u201chelp, people like her son and that is why I am supporting this\u201d. Ask and you shall receive \u2013 George Brandis is in town, because all the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade heads of mission are in town, for the annual \u201chow is the world going\u201d meeting. George Brandis has been spotted in the building. We are not sure why our man in London is here, but no doubt it is all very terribly important. Pauline Hanson is speaking to Sky News about a speech she is giving on family law reform, where she is calling for 50/50 joint custody of children, from the moment of separation. Anthony Albanese on the drug-testing proposal, while talking to Sky this morning: Well of course funding for rehabilitation is a good thing in its own right and on its own merits. The question here is does what the government propose have merit? When we look at the examples that have been given, both the audit office examination of what has occurred here, the examples in New Zealand where the figures show less than 1% of people who have been tested, it\u2019s been pretty ineffective at a high cost. And the real question here is how is it that the government \u2013 prime minister Morrison gave a speech on the weekend where he spoke about this fortnight\u2019s parliament being all about a test for Labor \u2013 how about the government govern? How about they come up with an economic plan rather than just political tactics from day to day? For an expert take on drug testing welfare recipients, read this: Samantha Maiden at the New Daily has an interesting story this morning: It was billed as an $800 aged bonus, with a million pensioners promised a cash splash under prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s deeming rate change. But documents released under freedom of information laws to the New Daily have revealed that seniors will secure just $5 a week on average for singles. The average windfall for aged pensioners is just $249 a year for singles \u2013 a fraction of the $800 pensioner bonus heralded across front pages in July. For couples, the average payment under the deeming rate changes is $3 a week and $156 a year. You can read more about that here And from Lorena Allam: Labor\u2019s Linda Burney is demanding the federal government take steps to sort out what she has described as a \u201csecret agreement\u201d that controls the use of the Aboriginal flag in public, because it is now unclear whether her own tattoo of the flag is a breach of copyright. \u201cThis situation is untenable,\u201d Burney said. \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable that the use of the Aboriginal flag is now governed by a secret agreement at the discretion of a for-profit company. \u201cIt is a discredit to the flag\u2019s history and the strength it represents.\u201d The flag\u2019s designer, Luritja artist Harold Thomas, holds copyright over the flag and has entered into a number of licensing agreements. Also from Paul Karp: Labor has ridden to the defence of the Coalition\u2019s $1.2bn Catholic and independent school package it formerly labelled a \u201cslush fund\u201d after the Greens revealed a plan to shut it down. Guardian Australia understands Labor will not support the Greens\u2019 move to disallow the \u201cchoice and affordability\u201d fund, with the shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, instead welcoming the fact the Morrison government has restored funding for Catholic and independent schools. The Greens education spokeswoman, Mehreen Faruqi, blasted Labor for joining the government in \u201csetting up a private school slush fund that has no justification, no accountability and no guarantee the cash won\u2019t go to subsidising fees for wealthy private schools\u201d. In the meantime, here are a few stories you may have missed. From Paul Karp: Australians rorting a scheme designed to allow travellers to claim back the goods and services tax have cost the budget up to $557m over 20 years, according to the audit office. In a scathing audit report released on Monday, the home affairs department and tax office were blamed for failing to undertake risk assessments and implementing only \u201climited systems\u201d to prevent revenue leakage. ... According to data estimates provided by home affairs, the scheme suffered \u201ca large level of non-compliance from Australian citizens and residents and significant revenue leakage\u201d of between $244m and $557m since July 2000. It\u2019s the usual party room/caucus quiet before the storm this morning. Lucky, we have the latest Brexit insanity to keep us busy Reading through the Hansard from last night, and Liberal MP Ian Goodenough made a very Ian Goodenough speech about religious freedom, which seemed to actually speak about Indigenous recognition, and for some reason, the flag: Looking to the future, I believe that all Australians should become more united through reconciliation and multiculturalism. Australians should all be united as one people under one flag, regardless of origins and history. I strongly belief in the principle of flying one national flag of national unity, under the banner of the Australian flag. Indigenous Australians, new migrants and people from different ethnic backgrounds, and persons born in Australia should all be treated equally, with access to opportunity and advancement based on merit. I was born in Singapore, a nation of many ethnic groups and religions which is very multicultural in nature and which has enjoyed relative harmony in its modern history. From a young age I was exposed to many different cultural practices, religious traditions and festivals in a multicultural society which was diverse and colourful. However, in Singapore\u2019s history race and ethnicity were once treated with more formality. Having emigrated from a country which once had a policy of recording a citizen\u2019s race on official documents, I can appreciate the benefits of not having one\u2019s racial background recorded on Australian official documents. Our constitution should promote harmony, unity and a single national identity, rather than differentiation based on race or ethnicity. It doesn\u2019t matter how long one has been in Australia or from which country we have come from. What matters is what we do in Australia \u2013 our accomplishments and achievements. We all share a collective responsibility to build up our nation together as one people. In any debate surrounding a referendum to change the constitution, the principal of national unity should be promoted \u2013 one people united under one flag. We must make constructive steps towards uniting all people as Australians, regardless of their origin, ethnicity or other attributes, advancing our nation into the future The drought is about to bite even harder for people who live outside of drought-impacted zones \u2013 food prices are about to increase, if you read between the lines of the latest Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Science statement into crop production: \u201cWinter crop production is forecast to rise by 11 percent in 2019\u201320 to 33.9 million tonnes but falls short of the 10-year average to 2018-19 by 16 percent,\u201d Abares acting Executive Director Peter Gooday said. \u201cWheat and canola production is forecast to increase 10 and 6 percent respectively, but both are expected to fall significantly below the 10-year average to 2018-19. \u201cBarley production is forecast to increase by 14 percent to around 9.5 million tonnes which brings it 6 percent above the 10-year average to 2018\u201119. \u201cCrop production deteriorated in regions across New South Wales and Queensland, due to unfavourable growing conditions over winter. Crop production in these states is forecast to be very much below average. \u201cOn the other hand, crops in Victoria were in good to very good condition at the beginning of spring thanks to generally favourable growing conditions over winter. \u201cCrops in Western Australia received timely winter rainfall to help boost yield prospects to around average for most crops after a late break to the season. \u201cSouth Australia received sufficient winter rainfall in most major growing regions, but the same can\u2019t be said for northern cropping regions with their prospects generally below average. \u201cEarly spring rainfall will be important to final crop outcomes.\u201d According to the latest seasonal outlook issued by the Bureau of Meteorology, September rainfall is likely to be above average in Western Australia and below average in most other cropping regions. October rainfall is likely to be below average in most cropping regions. \u201cIf realised, above average September rainfall in Western Australia would give cereal crops in the state a strong chance of achieving average to above average yields,\u201d Mr Gooday said. Mr Gooday said the seasonal conditions outlook for early spring in eastern Australia is likely to constrain crop prospects in southern New South Wales, and northern cropping regions in Victoria and South Australia. However, there\u2019s a good chance that most cropping regions in southern Victoria, and central and southern South Australia will still achieve average yields. Mr Gooday said outlook for summer crops is unfavourable due to poor seasonal conditions in northern New South Wales and Queensland. \u201cArea planted to summer crops is forecast to fall by 28 percent in 2019\u201320 to around 758,000 hectares\u2014production of grain sorghum, cotton and rice are all forecast to fall,\u201d Mr Gooday said. Jim Chalmers stopped by doors this morning (which meant he had been tapped to deliver this morning\u2019s missives). He responded to Scott Morrison\u2019s calls for Labor to support the drug testing trial policy: The prime minister last night on 7.30 said that he couldn\u2019t understand why people were resisting these drug testing trials. I mean, how out of touch can this guy be? It might be a 60-year-old trying to get back in the workforce for a long time, maybe having lost your job as a 50-year-old. The prime minister now wants you to pee in a cup in a demeaning way as a part of his picking fights with the Labor party. I mean this is \u2013 what he\u2019s proposing here hasn\u2019t worked overseas. It won\u2019t work here. It is indiscriminate. It\u2019s ineffective. It unnecessarily demeans people when they\u2019re trying to get back in the workforce and the health experts, the law and order experts, experts right across the board, have criticised this approach. That\u2019s why I question the government\u2019s motives here, its motivations. This, for the government, is not about getting people off drugs, or off welfare into work; it\u2019s about chasing headlines, it\u2019s about picking fights with the Labor party and I think people who are unemployed in this country deserve a government which actually cares about getting them into work, and prioritises that over these kind of political games. This always makes for some great shots (insert puns about parliamentarians and endangered animals here). Australia\u2019s political leaders will come face to face with some of Australia\u2019s most endangered native animals at Parliament House in Canberra today, to mark National Threatened Species Day. That\u2019s just after midday. Mike Bowers is on it. Jacqui Lambie all but quashed the government\u2019s hopes of passing its revived drug testing policy yesterday when she said she would not support it until she saw proper rehabilitation services put in place. Scott Morrison says his government will be talking to all the senators about the bill, including Lambie, but he says: \u201cThe question is, why won\u2019t Labor support, a fair dinkum trial to try to actually try and deal with one of the biggest challenges we have which is to try and help people break addictions, and find themselves in employment and actually change their lives for the better.\u201d Scott Morrison, who just attended to suicide prevention breakfast, has stopped by for a doorstop. Asked about criticisms that extending the cashless debit card program to more welfare recipients further stigmatises those on welfare, Morrison says \u201cI don\u2019t accept that\u201d and moves on to the next question. That\u2019s a favoured move of his \u2013 and he is very adept at it \u2013 he shuts down a question by saying he doesn\u2019t accept something, or gives a one-word answer, and moves on. It\u2019s not that the questions are not being asked, it\u2019s that they are not always answered. And we can\u2019t force politicians, of any ilk, to answer beyond the way they choose. Not news, but for those of you who like to be in the know about this sort of stuff, Mathias Cormann and Peter Dutton, who famously walk together most parliamentary mornings, have switched from walking along Red Hill to walking along the lake. It\u2019s been noted no less than three times to me this morning. No idea why the location change, but there you go. Anthony Albanese is chatting to Laura Jayes on Sky this morning. It looks as though Labor will be continuing the attack we saw yesterday \u2013 that the government concentrates on \u201cwedging\u201d Labor instead of actually coming up with a plan. \u201cThey continue to act like an opposition in exile, sitting on the government benches,\u201d Albanese said, pointing out that before the last two sittings, Scott Morrison had told his party room that pieces of legislation were \u201ctests for Labor\u201d. On who is right between Wayne Swan (keep the policies, but change the communication) or Mark Butler (we need to look at why we lost and properly examine what we are doing), Albanese all but says some policies will change, but the values won\u2019t. He again talks about the \u201cvision statements\u201d Labor will be releasing. But we won\u2019t see anything until after the review, which is due back in October. We\u2019ve woken this morning to more bad news on the fire front in Queensland and NSW, with more homes lost. Meanwhile, the annual Climate of the Nation report is out, and people are more concerned with the impacts of climate change than ever before. From Katharine Murphy\u2019s report: The annual Climate of the Nation survey, which has been tracking Australian attitudes to climate change for more than a decade, finds concern about droughts and flooding has risen from 74% of the survey in 2017 to 81% in 2019. Concern about climate-related extinctions \u2013 an issue highlighted dramatically in May when a major scientific report warned that a million species across the world faced extinction \u2013 has risen from 71% in 2017 to 78% in the 2019 survey, while concern about water shortages, an issue front of mind as a consequence of Australia\u2019s prolonged drought, has increased from 67% to 78%. Public sentiment about phasing out coal has also shifted in the past few years. In 2017 65% of the survey thought coal power stations should be phased out gradually to help manage the costs of the transition, but the percentage has dropped to 52% in 2019. The percentage of people believing the shift from coal to clean energy needs to be accelerated, even if the transition costs more in the short term, has increased from 19% in 2017 to 26% in 2019. There has also been an increase in the percentage of people in the survey arguing that Australia should completely end coal-fired power generation within the next 10 years. In 2017 30% of the survey agreed, and in 2019 39% agreed. Of course we have already had the argument over whether the fact rainforest is burning is because of climate change between Richard Di Natale and Pauline Hanson, but that aside, rainforest is burning when it hasn\u2019t burned before. And it\u2019s September. But that should come up today. And, if it doesn\u2019t, well that is the problem right there, isn\u2019t it? Meanwhile, there will be party room and caucus meetings today. Not a lot on the agendas, although I imagine Michelle Rowland\u2019s intervention will probably be brought up in Labor\u2019s catch-up. Also, Peter Dutton\u2019s home affairs department will also get a bit more heat today. You have Mike Bowers and Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp, as well as whatever amount of brain cells I manage to scrape together. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

But the Post<em> </em>has a history of these sorts of fact-free \u201cfactchecks\u201d \u2013 when Sanders claimed that \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d work multiple jobs, Glenn Kessler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreeneva/status/1143976408789766144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1143976408789766144&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2019%2F09%2F07%2Fglenn-kessler-fact-checker-washington-post-pulitzer%2F\">labeled the statement</a> \u201cmisleading\u201d, even though it was completely true. Ryan Grim <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/09/07/glenn-kessler-fact-checker-washington-post-pulitzer/\">has compiled a list</a> of the appalling record of the Post\u2019s<em> </em>unfair attacks on claims from the political left. Whatever this is, it isn\u2019t factchecking.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just an anti-Sanders bias. Donald Trump has some legitimate complaints about the press, too. Because he tells whopping lies all the time, journalists are predisposed to believe the worst about him and his administration. Recently, a Bloomberg Law<em> </em>reporter accused a labor department official of antisemitic Facebook posts. It was obvious the posts were sarcastic, and the reporter\u2019s work was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/3/20847587/leif-olson-department-labor-anti-semitism-paul-nehlen-bloomberg\">heavily criticized</a> and the coverage amended.

For example, when Trump claimed that millions of non-citizens voted illegally in the 2016 election, the Washington Post<em> </em>called him out in a \u201cfactcheck\u201d. But it turned out the Washington Post<em> </em>itself had published an <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/12/the-necessity-of-credibility\">article making this very same claim</a>.

But I also know that if my feelings about Trump lead to my making factual misstatements about him, his supporters will pounce, and claim that my bias destroys my credibility. If I state my prejudices up front, people will see me as more honest than if I pretend to be a mere \u201cfact checker\u201d when I\u2019m clearly an opinion writer.</p> <p>My personal experience is that conservatives are far more open to leftwing arguments when they come from people who are honest about their politics, and don\u2019t pretend not to have a point of view.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She said that while the Speaker must be neutral to different views, they do not have to be when it comes to the relationship between the government and parliament.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Speaker has to be scrupulously neutral as between different views within the House.

She would then personally vote remain should there be a second referendum on that deal.</p> \n<p>Morgan said Labour\u2019s negotiating position, should it be presented to the EU, was \u201ccatastrophically weak\u201d.</p> \n<p>Thornberry said: \u201cIf we had a referendum I believe what\u2019s best for jobs and the economy is remain in the European Union.

Contenders quickly launched bids to stand, including the current deputies, the Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle and the Conservative MP Eleanor Laing. Another Labour MP, Chris Bryant, is also expected to run. Harman, 69, would be the second woman to occupy the role if chosen by MPs after Betty Boothroyd\u2019s stint between 1992 and 2000. Harman has also served as solicitor general. She said that while the Speaker must be neutral to different views, they do not have to be when it comes to the relationship between the government and parliament. \u201cThe Speaker has to be scrupulously neutral as between different views within the House. But the Speaker is not neutral between parliament and the executive. The Speaker has to be on parliament\u2019s side and stand up for parliament,\u201d she said. \u201cParliament is relevant. The Speaker can make [government] come to the House of Commons and sometimes ministers would rather sit in their cosy departments and not have to answer the difficult questions but \u2026 [Bercow\u2019s] made parliament more relevant and more powerful,\u201d she said. She also raised how Bercow granted 152 urgent questions in the past year, compared with just two being granted in the year before he took over the role. Separately, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, took on the TV presenter Piers Morgan on Tuesday morning in a fiery exchange on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. She reiterated her party\u2019s position that Labour wants to have a close relationship with the EU on trade and will aim to strike a better deal than the former prime minister Theresa May was able to achieve. She would then personally vote remain should there be a second referendum on that deal. Morgan said Labour\u2019s negotiating position, should it be presented to the EU, was \u201ccatastrophically weak\u201d. Thornberry said: \u201cIf we had a referendum I believe what\u2019s best for jobs and the economy is remain in the European Union. So I would be dishonest to do anything other than to campaign for remain. However, if we\u2019re going to have a referendum we have to have a referendum of real choice.\u201d",

Concrete walls go up, and a deep distrust spreads across the holy land.</p> <p>The well-worn tale is used as the backdrop to multiple Israeli television dramas. Yet for one show, it is not Arabs and Jews who are doing the fighting, but Jews and Jews.</p> <p>Currently touring film festivals across the world, the six-part series Autonomies envisions a clash between secular Jews and the deeply religious ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews.</p> <p>In this vision, set in the near future, civil war has cut the land into two countries. The coastal State of Israel is nonreligious, with the cosmopolitan city of Tel Aviv as its capital.

      "bodyText": "\ufeffWar rages in the heart of the Middle East. Jerusalem is captured. Concrete walls go up, and a deep distrust spreads across the holy land. The well-worn tale is used as the backdrop to multiple Israeli television dramas. Yet for one show, it is not Arabs and Jews who are doing the fighting, but Jews and Jews. Currently touring film festivals across the world, the six-part series Autonomies envisions a clash between secular Jews and the deeply religious ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews. In this vision, set in the near future, civil war has cut the land into two countries. The coastal State of Israel is nonreligious, with the cosmopolitan city of Tel Aviv as its capital. Jerusalem is a walled, autonomous city-state, run by Haredi rabbis. At first glance dystopian, the show is in fact an artistic extrapolation of real-life rifts in Israeli society. Many Israelis increasingly see secular-Haredi disaccord about the future of the state as a greater concern than the Palestinian issue, and fear it could tear the country apart from the inside. Earlier this year, disagreements between secular and religious politicians shattered attempts to form a coalition government and dragged the country into a second round of elections. On 17 September, Israelis will go back to the polls following a campaign in which political parties have sought to exploit internal animosity. Yehonatan Indursky, an Israeli filmmaker who wrote Autonomies with the writer Ori Elon, says the show takes divisions in Israel \u201cto extremes, and tries to show what can happen if we do not wake up and try to find the way to live together and respect one another\u2019s way of life\u201d. The drama\u2019s protagonist, Broide (played by Assi Cohen), is a Haredi man who moves contraband, smuggling pornography and books banned by the religious authorities into Jerusalem. He is one of a few who crosses between the two sides and is soon caught up in a controversy that could reignite the war. The series comes off the back of the writers\u2019 hit Netflix show Shtisel, which received acclaim for sensitively and lovingly portraying Haredi family life, and has been renewed for a third season. Autonomies instead paints a much bleaker scene. \u201cAutonomies gives a kick in the stomach. And sometimes it is painful and hard to watch,\u201d Indursky said. What is fascinating for many viewers is how similar the setting of Autonomies appears. Israelis today lament a nation already divided, with the Haredim often living in their own neighbourhoods, women covering their hair with wigs and men wearing black coats and hats. To secular outcries, ultra-Orthodox politicians have sought to ban public transport and other activities on the Jewish holy day of rest, and outlaw non-kosher food in supermarket chains. They feel their way of life is under threat. Meanwhile, resentment against them focuses on hefty government stipends given to the community, as many men do not work but study religious texts. Almost half live in poverty. Indursky grew up in an ultra-Orthodox family in Jerusalem but has not been part of the community for years, although he keeps close links with family and friends. He said he had received two main responses from Israelis to the series, both of which saddened him. \u201cOne possible answer is that this is really not a dystopia but rather a utopia,\u201d he said, adding some viewers backed the idea of separate countries to end seemingly irreconcilable differences. \u201cThe second possible answer is that this is not a dystopia \u2013 this is the reality that currently exists in Israel. And in a way, that\u2019s part of what we wanted to show through the series.\u201d The fissure between secular and ultra-Orthodox communities has already spiralled to the point that it ignited a political crisis this year. The divisions centred on draft legislation insisting ultra-Orthodox Jews undertake mandatory national service, something religion students have mostly been exempt from since the country\u2019s founding in 1948. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also needed support from the secular ultranationalist party Yisrael Beiteinu for a majority in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, and the argument eventually forced it to disband. It is feared disunity will only increase. The Haredim are the fastest growing demographic of Israeli society, now at more than one million in a country of just nine million, according to the Israel Democracy Institute.

Families were told the black box flight recorder was damaged; all previous flight data was recoverable but the recording of AF1611 was unreadable. Wreckage brought up from the sea bed was immediately confiscated by France\u2019s military authorities. In 2011, Michael Laty, a former army employee, told French television the aircraft had been hit by a heat-seeking missile that had veered off target and hit one of the Caravelle\u2019s engines. \u201cI typed up an army investigation into the affair; it was kept secret in the national interest. The Caravelle was shot down. We brought down a civil aircraft instead of the programmed target,\u201d Laty said. An official inquiry, however, concluded a fire had started in the plane toilet. Today, a new eight-year investigation by gendarmes who seized previously unseen evidence has reportedly found otherwise. St\u00e9phane Nesa, one of two lawyers representing passengers\u2019 families, said the fire theory was nonsense. \u201cThis has been discredited for 45 years. It is completely and technically impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe investigating judge has written to the government asking them to lift the \u2018defence secret\u2019 classification, but it has been over a year and we have had no response. The longer the government continues in this way, the more we feel they don\u2019t want to establish the truth more than 50 years after the facts.\u201d Nesa added: \u201cThere were 95 people on that plane who died including children. Their families don\u2019t want money. They want to know the truth.\u201d Mathieu Paoli, 75, and his brothers Louis, 72, and Jacques, 81, lost their mother Toussainte, 59, and father Ange-Marie, 60, in the crash. \u201cThe investigating judge has said he is practically certain to almost 100% that the plane was hit by a missile. Now we are waiting,\u201d Mathieu said. \u201cSome people ask us: \u2018What are you looking for? You will never know.\u2019 I tell them our parents are at the bottom of the sea and we cannot do our grieving without knowing exactly what happened to them.\u201d The O\u2019Connor sisters say they rarely speak of the accident, but it is a wound that reopens every anniversary. \u201cIt\u2019s always there,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI was too small at the time to remember much about our father, but I remember the realisation that we were on our own. Our mother, who died 15 years ago, was left widowed in her early 40s with four children. She never talked about it, but it always played on her mind. She was heartbroken.\u201d Margaret added: \u201cWhile he was away he wrote postcards to each of us and they kept coming for about three weeks afterwards \u2026 It\u2019s strange that with so many people on the plane whose families have been pushing to know the truth and all this time later we still don\u2019t know.\u201d The French defence ministry did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for information except to say it was for the armed forces minister, Florence Parly, to decide on declassification. On Tuesday, 24 hours before the anniversary, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote to the Paoli brothers saying he hoped the affair would be declassified and he had asked Parly to begin the process of releasing documents related to the crash. For Mathieu, establishing the truth remains his life\u2019s mission. \u201cWe don\u2019t want money. We don\u2019t want to blame anyone. We don\u2019t even want a sorry \u2026 We are waiting to hear the truth. We have waited for 51 years.\u201d",

Their sparkle helps sell tickets and shift jerseys, but what is revealed if we scratch beneath the surface of their recent achievements? Is it now easier to score in MLS than it has been previously? Has that been a factor in their success?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/mls-and-antifa-americas-top-flight-grapples-with-political-signage-ban\">MLS and Antifa: America's top flight grapples with political signage ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recent seasons has seen the average number of goals in an MLS match creep up and up. Last season saw 3.19 goals scored per regular season game, up from 2.97 the season before that and 2.81 the season before that. In fact, not since the 2002 season had the average goals per regular season game ratio tipped the scales at three until last season. This season is currently charting at 3.1 goals per game.</p> <p>Of course, MLS has been home to clinical goalscorers before. Roy Lassiter\u2019s single season record of 27 goals stood for 16 years until Chris Wondolowski equalled it during the 2012 season for the San Jose Earthquakes. Stern John also scored 26 goals over the 1998 season for the Columbus Crew while Mamadou Diallo reached the same number for the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 2000.</p> <p>But of the five most prolific goalscoring seasons in MLS history, four have come in the last seven years. As things stand, it\u2019s likely that Vela will set a new single season scoring record just 12 months after Martinez pushed the record up to 31 goals in the 2018 campaign. The Los Angeles FC forward is just five goals away from pushing it up again.</p> <p>Vela has never before charted such impressive numbers. The Mexican, who is a forward, but hardly a six-yard box poacher, enjoyed a successful five-year stint at Real Sociedad, but he never bettered a ratio of a goal every three games. For context, Vela currently has 27 goals in 26 league games for LAFC this season - better than a goal every game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85baeaa0c31839cc40c6ca5e8ed91096003d1525\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85baeaa0c31839cc40c6ca5e8ed91096003d1525/0_66_2445_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Vela is on course to break MLS\u2019s goalscoring record\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Vela is on course to break MLS\u2019s goalscoring record.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those looking to use the current level of MLS goalscoring to make a judgement against the league as a whole might point to Vela\u2019s dramatic upturn in numbers as evidence of its defensive frailty. Similarly, Martinez\u2019s goalscoring ratio was less than impressive during his time in Europe \u2013 he only scored seven times in three years for Torino.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic\u2019s success has been less surprising given his magnificent achievements in the sport before pitching up at the LA Galaxy last summer. Indeed, his MLS scoring rate (0.9 goals per game) is pretty much on par with the numbers he charted at Milan (0.875 goals per game) and Paris Saint-Germain (0.92 goals per game). At 37, though, a drop-off might have been expected.</p> <p>One explanation for the surge in MLS\u2019s goals per game could be the number of expansion teams that have entered the league in recent years. FC Cincinnati, for instance, have conceded 72 times in just 29 games so far this season. They are just two goals away from tying Orlando City\u2019s record for MLS\u2019s worst defensive season. Two seasons before that, Minnesota United conceded 70 times in their first top flight season.</p> <p>Historically, there is a direct correlation between expansion seasons and a rise in goalscoring. In 1998, for instance, the Chicago Fire and the Miami Fusion joined the league and the average goals per game shot up from 3.26 the season before to 3.65 - a record that still stands to this day. In fact, the early days of MLS were characterised by goals and lots of them. Only once in the league\u2019s first seven seasons did the goals per game ratio drop below three (1999 - 2.86 goals per game). At that stage of MLS\u2019s development, every team was essentially an expansion side.</p> <p>MLS\u2019s salary cap and Designated Player rule means teams naturally weight their payroll towards attackers. They are after all the ones who catch the eye most of all, the most obvious of difference makers. </p> <p>Raising the salary cap or lifting the number of DPs permitted would surely see MLS teams achieve a greater balance across their rosters, potentially improving the standard of the league\u2019s defensive play. Until then, however, the top-heavy nature of most MLS sides will keep the goalscoring rates high. With Inter Miami, Nashville, Austin FC and a St Louis team set to join the league over the next three years, they could get even higher. History suggests this is probable.</p> <p>It may well be easier to score in MLS now than it was a few years ago. Whether that is the product of an increase in attacking potency or a decrease in defensive quality is largely down to interpretation, but if goals are the currency of the sport then MLS is particularly rich right now.</p>",

Indeed, Ibrahimovic, Martinez and Vela have become the billboard boys of MLS over the past two years. Their sparkle helps sell tickets and shift jerseys, but what is revealed if we scratch beneath the surface of their recent achievements? Is it now easier to score in MLS than it has been previously? Has that been a factor in their success? Recent seasons has seen the average number of goals in an MLS match creep up and up. Last season saw 3.19 goals scored per regular season game, up from 2.97 the season before that and 2.81 the season before that. In fact, not since the 2002 season had the average goals per regular season game ratio tipped the scales at three until last season. This season is currently charting at 3.1 goals per game. Of course, MLS has been home to clinical goalscorers before. Roy Lassiter\u2019s single season record of 27 goals stood for 16 years until Chris Wondolowski equalled it during the 2012 season for the San Jose Earthquakes. Stern John also scored 26 goals over the 1998 season for the Columbus Crew while Mamadou Diallo reached the same number for the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 2000. But of the five most prolific goalscoring seasons in MLS history, four have come in the last seven years. As things stand, it\u2019s likely that Vela will set a new single season scoring record just 12 months after Martinez pushed the record up to 31 goals in the 2018 campaign. The Los Angeles FC forward is just five goals away from pushing it up again. Vela has never before charted such impressive numbers. The Mexican, who is a forward, but hardly a six-yard box poacher, enjoyed a successful five-year stint at Real Sociedad, but he never bettered a ratio of a goal every three games. For context, Vela currently has 27 goals in 26 league games for LAFC this season - better than a goal every game. Those looking to use the current level of MLS goalscoring to make a judgement against the league as a whole might point to Vela\u2019s dramatic upturn in numbers as evidence of its defensive frailty. Similarly, Martinez\u2019s goalscoring ratio was less than impressive during his time in Europe \u2013 he only scored seven times in three years for Torino. Ibrahimovic\u2019s success has been less surprising given his magnificent achievements in the sport before pitching up at the LA Galaxy last summer. Indeed, his MLS scoring rate (0.9 goals per game) is pretty much on par with the numbers he charted at Milan (0.875 goals per game) and Paris Saint-Germain (0.92 goals per game). At 37, though, a drop-off might have been expected. One explanation for the surge in MLS\u2019s goals per game could be the number of expansion teams that have entered the league in recent years. FC Cincinnati, for instance, have conceded 72 times in just 29 games so far this season. They are just two goals away from tying Orlando City\u2019s record for MLS\u2019s worst defensive season. Two seasons before that, Minnesota United conceded 70 times in their first top flight season. Historically, there is a direct correlation between expansion seasons and a rise in goalscoring. In 1998, for instance, the Chicago Fire and the Miami Fusion joined the league and the average goals per game shot up from 3.26 the season before to 3.65 - a record that still stands to this day. In fact, the early days of MLS were characterised by goals and lots of them. Only once in the league\u2019s first seven seasons did the goals per game ratio drop below three (1999 - 2.86 goals per game). At that stage of MLS\u2019s development, every team was essentially an expansion side. MLS\u2019s salary cap and Designated Player rule means teams naturally weight their payroll towards attackers. They are after all the ones who catch the eye most of all, the most obvious of difference makers. Raising the salary cap or lifting the number of DPs permitted would surely see MLS teams achieve a greater balance across their rosters, potentially improving the standard of the league\u2019s defensive play. Until then, however, the top-heavy nature of most MLS sides will keep the goalscoring rates high. With Inter Miami, Nashville, Austin FC and a St Louis team set to join the league over the next three years, they could get even higher. History suggests this is probable. It may well be easier to score in MLS now than it was a few years ago. Whether that is the product of an increase in attacking potency or a decrease in defensive quality is largely down to interpretation, but if goals are the currency of the sport then MLS is particularly rich right now.",

That\u2019s 8km an hour in full cricket kit \u2013 long-sleeved shirts and trousers, padding and a helmet \u2013 for what could be eight hours in the hot sun. When the air temperature becomes higher than the skin temperature, the only way the body can try to cool down is through sweating \u2013 which becomes difficult when the skin is covered with protective clothing. The body becomes unable to function properly and this can result in anything from heat cramps to the medical emergency that is heatstroke.

These stresses will also affect umpires \u2013 who, if not so active, stand for hours and have to make split-second decisions with unwavering concentration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/cricketers-boycott-and-strauss-knighted-in-mays-resignation-honours\">Geoffrey Boycott knighted in May's honours despite assault conviction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To date, only Cricket Australia have any sort of rules surrounding heat \u2013 last August they introduced Heat Stress Risk Index Management Interventions \u2013 which involve mitigations from increasing the number of drinks breaks to, ultimately, suspending play. As anyone who has desperately waited for the temperature to fall during the suffocating torpor of a sweltering afternoon knows, these will not be short sharp rain breaks.</p> <p>What next, then? The report comes up with a page of suggestions that cricket would do well to heed. These range from encouraging all countries to come up with their own heat rules, and kit manufacturers to make heat-resistant clothing and equipment, even suggesting that cricketers should experiment with shorts, to suggesting authorities test players\u2019 abilities under heat stress and, controversially, extend the length of tours to help acclimatisation. It points out authorities have a duty of care to children, who are less able to regulate their body temperatures.

      "bodyText": "This year the UK experienced its hottest winter day, its hottest Easter, its hottest day on record. That peak of 38.7C came as England\u2019s men played Ireland at Lord\u2019s, when MCC members in the pavilion were allowed to remove their jackets for the second year in a row \u2013 surely a sign of doom to match the best of Jericho\u2019s trumpets. All around the cricketing world the climate emergency has started to bite, affecting everyone from elite players in their air-conditioned hotels to the two billion fans who play and watch in some of the most climate-sensitive places on the planet. And yet \u2013 despite the cancellation of club and school cricket in South Africa in 2018 because of drought; the movement of IPL matches because of lack of water; extreme flooding in the UK; the suspension of play due to air pollution during a Test in Delhi, and hurricanes devastating the Caribbean \u2013 cricketers and cricket authorities have shown no great inclination to stand up and shout about this threat to the game. The gold medal Olympians Helen Glover and Etienne Stott, who was arrested in April at the Waterloo Bridge Extinction Rebellion protests, were among 19 sports stars who wrote a letter to the Guardian last month calling for sports to reduce their climate footprint and sportsmen and women to lead the fight. No cricketers signed the letter. Nor have the ICC or any member boards joined the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework \u2013 which has members as varied as the Rugby League World Cup 2021 and Bowls Australia. Alas, the difficult file marked climate crisis seemed destined to sit forever on the pending shelf, until perhaps now, with Tuesday\u2019s publication of the Hit for Six report. This follows where the Game Changer report of February 2018 dipped its toes, drilling deep into the climate data \u2013 not only detailing the impacts already felt by cricket-playing countries and the likely problems to come, but also discussing the impact these environmental changes will have on individual cricketers, particularly in situations of extreme heat. Experiments at the University of Portsmouth revealed that the heat produced by an international batsman with what is essentially a series of shuttle sprints between the wickets is equivalent to running 8km an hour. That\u2019s 8km an hour in full cricket kit \u2013 long-sleeved shirts and trousers, padding and a helmet \u2013 for what could be eight hours in the hot sun. When the air temperature becomes higher than the skin temperature, the only way the body can try to cool down is through sweating \u2013 which becomes difficult when the skin is covered with protective clothing. The body becomes unable to function properly and this can result in anything from heat cramps to the medical emergency that is heatstroke. Joe Root is a case in point, taken to hospital during the Sydney Test of 2018 after retiring hurt with a combination of dehydration and a gastro-intestinal bug after playing in temperatures that peaked at 43.7C. Understandable, when you consider that the ideal temperature for exercise in light clothing is 10-11C. The report also details psychological responses to heat, with increased body temperature interfering with the efficiency of the human brain. While simple tasks, flipping a coin at the toss, should remain invulnerable to heat stress, more complex decisions \u2013 the report suggests, \u201cvigilance (the ability to maintain attention, for example, when batting), short-term/working memory (for example a bowler remembering how the ball bounced off the pitch) and dual tasks (for example, a batter keeping an eye on an incoming delivery while simultaneously manoeuvring to take a shot)\u201d become much more difficult \u2013 which, as cat follows mouse, will result in a less skilful and less watchable game. These stresses will also affect umpires \u2013 who, if not so active, stand for hours and have to make split-second decisions with unwavering concentration. To date, only Cricket Australia have any sort of rules surrounding heat \u2013 last August they introduced Heat Stress Risk Index Management Interventions \u2013 which involve mitigations from increasing the number of drinks breaks to, ultimately, suspending play. As anyone who has desperately waited for the temperature to fall during the suffocating torpor of a sweltering afternoon knows, these will not be short sharp rain breaks. What next, then? The report comes up with a page of suggestions that cricket would do well to heed. These range from encouraging all countries to come up with their own heat rules, and kit manufacturers to make heat-resistant clothing and equipment, even suggesting that cricketers should experiment with shorts, to suggesting authorities test players\u2019 abilities under heat stress and, controversially, extend the length of tours to help acclimatisation. It points out authorities have a duty of care to children, who are less able to regulate their body temperatures. It calls on cricket to bear in mind that in times of climate crisis, authorities will prioritise food and drinking water, not watering cricket pitches, and recommends the setting up of an ICC global climate disaster fund. Much, then, to think about \u2013 before cricket even gets on the existential question of how it marries the constant desire for expansion with responsibility for the planet. As Kevin Mitchell, the prime minister of Grenada, writes in the report\u2019s forward: \u201cClimate change is real. It\u2019s as simple as that. Every ball bowled at us is currently a bouncer. We\u2019re ducking so much we\u2019re struggling to build an innings that will ensure a safe, secure and sustainable future for our people.\u201d \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

Appearing before the federal court on Tuesday, counsel for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Michael Hodge QC, said it was \u201centirely commercially realistic\u201d to say that TPG would resume previous plans to roll out a network if the merger was stopped. But counsel for TPG, Ruth Higgins SC, said TPG\u2019s plans were effectively killed off by federal government \u201csecurity guidance\u201d provided in August last year that advised against using equipment from the Chinese supplier Huawei to create 5G networks. Vodafone and TPG are challenging an ACCC decision opposing their merger in a case that has excited more attention than usual because it has forced TPG\u2019s reclusive billionaire managing director, David Teoh, to make an extremely unusual public appearance. Teoh, who has been photographed by the media only once, will give evidence later. The ACCC has also boosted the profile of the hearings by hiring Hodge, one of the counsels assisting at the Hayne banking royal commission, to represent it. If the merger is kiboshed it was likely TPG would create its own network to compete with the existing ones run by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, the regulator has said. Higgins told the court the government \u201cban\u201d on Huawei put a stop to TPG\u2019s plans to create a new mobile network, even though it had previously tried to do so in 2017 after purchasing a chunk of radio spectrum. \u201cBy mid-January 2019 it was clear the Huawei ban effectively blocked TPG\u2019s pathway to upgrading its network to 5G,\u201d she said. She said TPG\u2019s board resolved that \u201cit did not make sense for TPG to spend shareholder funds rolling out a network that could not be upgraded to 5G\u201d. Counsel for Vodafone, Peter Brereton SC, said it would be \u201ccommercially crazy\u201d for TPG to create a fourth network now. \u201cThere are better options for TPG to use the assets that they have, and your honour will have the TPG senior decision-makers along to tell you why they wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. Hodge said TPG would go back to its previous plan: to roll out a network using the current generation 4G technology and then upgrade it to 5G. He said there was no roadblock to TPG doing this. \u201cWhen you go back and look at the objective facts it is difficult to understand how that could be put up in front of your honour,\u201d he said. The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s what we know as we head into the evening on Tuesday: There are 80 fires still burning across Queensland. About 400 residents have been at emergency evacuation centres at Peregian, and only one home was lost at Peregian Beach overnight. Residents in Peregian Beach, Peregian Breeze Estate and south of Lake Weyba have been advised to evacuate as a bushfire heads in a north, north-westerly direction from Peregian Beach. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, will cut short her overseas trip by a day and return home after a meeting with International Olympic Committee officials in Switzerland. Guardian Australia understands the meeting could not be moved, but Palaszczuk will come right back once it is over. Police located a 12-year-old boy who allegedly lit a fire in bushland at Woodridge, which spread to a nearby storage centre and destroyed a fence, two shipping containers and the contents of those containers. There are still 50 fires burning across New South Wales, with 21 fires uncontained. A total of 630 firefighters have been deployed across the state. A fire in Bees Nest, north-west of Dorrigo in the Armidale area, is currently over 66,500 hectates and out of control. A fire in Drake has burnt more than 40,000 hectares and is out of control. A fire in Legume, in the Tenterfield area, has been contained after burning more than 1,600 hectares, while a Share Creek fire in the Yuraygir national park is not yet under control. Meanwhile the federal water minister, David Littleproud, has told my colleague Paul Karp that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know if climate change is manmade\u201d as he clarified earlier comments that the question is \u201cirrelevant\u201d when considering the government\u2019s response to intensifying bushfires: I\u2019m about practical outcomes, whether that\u2019s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt. I am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate. Here\u2019s a video of a water bomber working on the Peregian fire in Queensland. Not too surprising, given the circumstances. Back in NSW, the rural fire service advises the threat at Flagstone Rd in Legume has eased, and firefighters have contained the fire. They\u2019re continuing to monitor the situation and will extinguish hotspots. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is cutting her trip short given the bushfire crisis currently engulfing her state. Palaszczuk is currently in Lausanne, Switzerland meeting with International Olympic Committee officials in regard to a potential Queensland bid for the 2032 Olympic Games. Deputy premier Jackie Trad has been acting premier, after the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission decided last week it would not investigate her over a house purchase. Residents in Brookhill and Oak Valley south of Townsville are being advised by Queensland Fire and Emergency to prepare to leave, due to a fast-moving bushfire in Brookhill heading in a westerly direction, with conditions expected to get worse. They advise that fire crews are working to contain the fire but may not be able to protect every property. Local resident Rob Campbell on Monday night describing the fire at Peregian Beach. He said the \u201cfireys have no chance\u201d. NSW Rural Fire Service has also issued a warning for residents on Long Gully Rd, Drake, after the fire breached containment lines in the Sandy Point area. The fire is burning close to homes in the Sandy Hill area, and homes in Macleods Creek Road are under threat, they said. People in Sandy Hill are advised to make final preparations now, while residents in Drake, Ewingar, Tilbaroo, and the western side of the Clarence River are advised to put their bush fire survival plan into action. Fire and Rescue NSW is reporting there are 20 fire crews battling the blaze at the Moorebank factory. They\u2019ve advised residents to stay indoors and keep windows closed due to all the smoke. A dozen fire trucks are on the scene of a factory fire in Moorebank in Sydney\u2019s south-west, Seven News is reporting. Emergency services in Queensland are advising residents in Peregian Breeze Estate to evacuate south along Sunshine Motorway towards Nambour Showgrounds, while Peregian Beach and Marcus Beach residents should evacuate northerly towards Noosa. The \u201cfast-moving\u201d fire is currently moving in a north, north-westerly direction from Peregian Beach towards the southern end of Lake Weyba. Queensland Police also has this video of the water bombers working to fight the fire in Peregian filling up. Meanwhile, this is what it looks like when an air tanker drops fire retardant on the fire in NSW. A fire in bushland and part of a Logan City Council storage facility was the fault of a 12-year-old boy who deliberately lit the fire, Queensland police allege. The police allege in a statement that a group of juveniles were in bushland behind the Woodridge Skate Park when one boy deliberately lit a fire, which spread to a nearby storage centre and destroyed a fence, two shipping containers and the contents of those containers. The fire was put out by emergency services, and after an investigation a 12-year-old boy from Slacks Creek was located. Police say he will be dealt with under the provisions of the Youth Justice Act. Queensland police has shared this video taken from a police helicopter over the Peregian and OReillys fires on Monday night. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague Josh Taylor now who will take you through the afternoon. Thanks for reading! Earlier in September Queensland Fire and Emergency Services\u2019 predictive services inspector, Andrew Sturgess, said the state had never before seen such serious bushfire conditions, so early in spring. It raises the obvious question - why? This datablog from our own Nick Evershed - although a few years old - tries to answer the question of whether our bushfire seasons are getting long. Firefighters in New South Wales are still battling strong winds at a fire near the town of Yamba. Water-bombing aircraft are dropping fire retardant near homes under threat from the blaze. Carroll confirmed that there had been charges in relation to some of the fires currently burning. She said officers were looking into the cause behind eight fires currently burning in the state. Earlier, police said detectives were investigating the cause of the fire at Peregian Beach on the Sunshine Coast and were \u201cspeaking with a number of teenagers\u201d in relation to the matter. Our Queensland correspondent Ben Smee said witnesses had told him they saw \u201ca group of teens set alight a milk crate and throw it into bushland at Peregian, near where the bushfire in the area is understood to have started\u201d. OK let\u2019s do a quick recap of that press conference The acting Queensland premier, Jackie Trad, says there are 80 fires burning in the state. She confirmed only one home had been lost at Peregian Beach on the Sunshine coast overnight, saying the \u201cherculean efforts\u201d for firefighters \u201cresulted in nothing short of a miracle\u201d. There are 400 people still at emergency evacuation centres near Peregian. Trad said there was no timeline on when they will be able to return to their homes. Queensland\u2019s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, announced the establishment of a taskforce to investigate the circumstances behind eight fires currently burning. That number, she said, was likely to increase. \u201cSome of the behaviour has been unfortunately reckless and other behaviour has been purposeful,\u201d she said. Craig Crawford, the Queensland minister for social resources, said there were more than 1000 firefighters and 250 trucks working across Queensland. \u201cI think that is actually more than what we ever had during the November fires last year at any one time,\u201d he said. Richard Wardle from the Bureau of Meteorology said that \u201cunfortunately\u201d the long-term outlooks are for above average temperatures in most of Queensland on Friday and Saturday, meaning the fire danger will remain high. Carroll says that while some fires have \u201cjust clearly gotten away from kids thinking they are having fun\u201d others have been \u201creckless and purposeful behaviour by others\u201d. \u201cThis task force will stay in place until I am satisfied that we have dealt with all fires across the state and will continue throughout the coming weeks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe consequences of some of these fires are dire. People can die. Buildings and residences are being destroyed and obviously some of them can carry life imprisonment offences if it is found to be purposeful and people do die as a result.\u201d Queensland\u2019s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, announcing she\u2019s established a taskforce to investigate eight fires which have occurred in the last few days. \u201cThat number will increase,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many, many charges that have already been laid in relation to this.\u201d \u201cSome of the behaviour has been unfortunately reckless and other behaviour has been purposeful. Some of the fires have involved children playing and obviously the consequences are dire as a result of that and, as I said, some of them have been purposeful and malicious. Can I please ask parents to speak to their children.\u201d A representative from Queensland fire and emergency services says the work in the fighting the blaze will continue \u201cfor days and weeks\u201d because of the remoteness of some of the fires. Of the fire at Peregian, he says it\u2019s still \u201can active going fire\u201d. \u201cBut we are confident with the aircraft and the number of resources that we have on that fire as we speak that the asset protection is well protected, but again we cannot afford to have people in that area yet go back to those areas,\u201d the spokesman says. \u201cWe still have a lot of firefighting activity. It simply is not safe.\u201d Richard Wardle from the Bureau of Meteorology speaking now. Says that \u201cunfortunately\u201d the long-term outlooks are for above average temperatures on Friday and Saturday with no significant rainfall predicted for the fire-affected areas. \u201cWe do have those very high fire dangers over much of Queensland today with that very dry air mass,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will see those winds pick up during the course of today, but then ease later today and tend more south, south-easterly so at the moment we have quite a bit of smoke on coastal areas in south-east Queensland. \u201cWe will see that smoke move a little bit more inland as those winds swing around more south-easterly. We do expect those fire danger ratings to reduce tomorrow [and] Wednesday, over most of Queensland, as those winds decrease [but] as I said, we do expect those above average temperatures to return on Friday and Saturday, so we expect to see a return to the very high fire danger ratings on those days.\u201d She says there are 80 fires burning throughout Queensland. \u201cAs I said before, it was nothing short of a miracle when you consider the ember storm that was engulfing those communities and how unpredictable and quickly that fire emerged late yesterday,\u201d Trad says. Trad says there are 400 people still at emergency evacuation centres near Peregian. She says there\u2019s no timeline on when they will be able to return to their homes. \u201cUnfortunately we will not be able to provide advice to them to return back to their homes until proper safety assessments have been done on properties, as well as on transport routes to ensure we have a clear way through for firefighters, for emergency service vehicles, right throughout the day,\u201d she says. She\u2019s scolding some of the reporting which suggested as many as a dozen properties had been destroyed in the fire. \u201cThe single source of truth in relation to the unfolding bushfires throughout Queensland is the Queensland fire and emergency service and the Queensland Police. They are the ones on the ground, rolling up their sleeves, leading our state at a time when we are in unprecedented territory,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I do have to say that [when] we want to curtail panic in the community, it is the police and QFES who should be referred to as the single source of truth in relation to bushfires.\u201d Queensland\u2019s acting premier, Jackie Trad, is speaking now. She said last night\u2019s \u201cherculean efforts resulted in nothing short of a miracle\u201d. \u201cMore than 300 firefighters worked from 4.30 yesterday afternoon all throughout the night and many of them are still there working to contain the fire at Peregian,\u201d she says. As I mentioned earlier the Binna Burra Lodge, in the world-heritage-listed rainforest of Lamington national park, was destroyed by bushfire on the weekend. Writer Mary-Rose MacColl has reflected on the lodge\u2019s history: \u201cThis is an obituary for quaint slab-wood cabins, a place that was burned down on the weekend in a fire devastating for the many thousands of people who have visited over the past 85 years.\u201d A satellite map showing the spread of fires burning in the Lamington national park in Queensland. That feared southerly change at Shark Creek near Yamba has arrived. At least nine homes have been lost in fires burning across NSW. According to the state\u2019s Rural Fire Service there are more than 50 bush and grass fires burning along the coast between Newcastle and Byron Bay and inland as far as Bourke. There are three major out-of-control fires due to continuing high winds \u2013 the fire north of Yamba, another near Armidale in the New England area and another at Drake near Tenterfield. Almost 400 firefighters are on the ground across the state, which is expected to increase to nearly 800 throughout Tuesday. Some 20 blazes are yet to be contained. The RFS has confirmed that nine properties have been destroyed by the fire at Drake and Tenterfield. Two car yards and a pistol club have also been destroyed and another six homes and 23 outbuildings have been damaged. Strong southerly winds with expected gusts of up to 80km/h are expected in the Shark Creek area north of Yamba on Tuesday morning which could threaten homes in that area. This map (below) is helpful if you\u2019re struggling to get your head around where the main fires of concern are burning. You can see the two major fire fronts burning in Queensland, but authorities also have concerns about fires burning in New South Wales \u2013 in particular a fire burning near the town of Yamba. The fire has already burned more than 7750 hectares in the Yuraygir national park and Shark Creek in the Clarence Valley area south of Yamba. The NSW Rural Fire Service is concerned about strengthening southerly winds that could push the fire towards Yamba and firefighters are working to protect homes that \u201ccame under direct threat on Monday\u201d. \u201cThe fire has burnt close to homes overnight, and properties may come under threat again today due to strong and gusty winds,\u201d the RFS said in a statement. Queensland deputy premier Jackie Trad is expected to give a news conference shortly to update us on the fire situation. Reports last night that about 10 houses were destroyed in Peregian don\u2019t appear to be correct in the (still hazy) light of day. At this stage, we know one house was destroyed and a handful of others damaged. That\u2019s particularly remarkable given some of the footage we\u2019ve seen showing burning embers being blown into suburban areas by gusting winds. A huge efforts by firefighters \u2013 about 115 crews in total \u2013 saved dozens of homes and businesses in the Peregian area overnight. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has spoken to reporters about the bushfires burning across the two states this morning. Queensland police have reported people trying to access exclusion zones around Peregian Beach on the Sunshine Coast, and Morrison urged people to pay heed to the warnings from authorities. \u201cMy simple message to Australians is to listen carefully to the warnings that are there, to follow those instructions, to not put yourself, if at all possible, in a position of risk, and to provide support to one another, as Australians always do in these circumstances,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ve seen on display the great character and care of Australians when they\u2019re fating these sorts of disasters. And I want to thank everybody, all the volunteers, who have been out there, all of those who have been out there providing assistance to people, working in the evacuation centres, or out there supporting the firefighters, and, indeed, the firefighters themselves.\u201d A day after fire ripped through the historic Binna Burra Lodge in Queensland\u2019s Lamington national park, guests and staff have had to make a treacherous evacuation from another nearby eco-resort. Authorities made the decision mid-afternoon on Monday to advise people to leave O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Rainforest Retreat. The evacuation was abandoned late on Monday afternoon, after the fire shifted towards the Lamington National Park Road. About 100 staff, guests and police officers who had been unable to leave spent about three hours at the resort waiting for news. Authorities coordinated their departure about 8pm. The main concern had been predictions of erratic winds, which made the movement of the fire front unpredictable, in the early hours of this morning. The fire in the national park is still burning out of control. The fire which destroyed two properties on the Sunshine Coast overnight continues to burn in a northerly direction on Tuesday. Fire authorities in Queensland have issued an evacuation warning for residents in the areas of Peregian Beach, Peregian Breeze Estate, Marcus Beach and Weyba. \u201cLeaving immediately is the safest option, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive,\u201d the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said on Tuesday morning. \u201cThe fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community. Conditions are now very dangerous and firefighters may soon be unable to prevent the fire advancing. The fire may pose a threat to all lives directly in its path. Fire crews may not be able to protect your property.\u201d Good morning, Firefighters are battling more than 100 bushfires in Queensland and New South Wales. At least one property has been destroyed at Peregian Beach on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast overnight and hundreds of people have been forced out of their homes and into evacuation centres. There are about 70 fires still burning across Queensland. A fire in the Lamington national park on the Gold Coast hinterland which razed Binna Burra - an historic eco-tourism lodge built in the 1930s surrounded by subtropical Gondwana rainforest \u2013 continues to burn and high winds are concerning fire crews. In NSW, there are some 58 fires burning, mostly in the state\u2019s north towards the Queensland border. Fire has already burned more than 7,750 hectares in the Yuraygir national park and Shark Creek in the Clarence Valley south of Yamba on the coast, where fire crews are trying to protect homes amid fears that a southerly change could push one of them towards Yamba. We\u2019ll keep you updated on conditions on the ground throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "There were extraordinary scenes of chaos and anger in the House of Commons overnight as opposition MPs staged a protest against the suspension of parliament for five weeks \u2013 a prorogation that the Speaker of the House said represented \u201can act of executive fiat\u201d. As John Bercow began proceedings to prorogue parliament, a group of opposition MPs carrying signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d drowned out Black Rod as she tried to address the Speaker, a ritual that initiates the suspension. Several MPs were also involved in an altercation near the Speaker\u2019s chair, as they attempted to prevent him leaving his seat and attending the House of Lords, the next step in the formalities required for the suspension of parliament. One Labour MP threw himself across Bercow\u2019s chair in protest at the shutting down of parliament. Lloyd Russell-Moyle tried to block the Speaker by lying across him momentarily to stop him leaving to the House of Lords in the official ceremony to prorogue parliament. Other Labour colleagues, including the shadow women and equalities minister, Dawn Butler, and the backbencher Clive Lewis held up posters that read \u201csilenced\u201d. As Russell-Moyle was pushed away by a member of Commons staff, the Green party leader, Caroline Lucas, was seen to tumble as MPs still sitting in the chamber in the early hours of Tuesday morning started heckling and shouting. Lewis tweeted that the group of MPs had been trying to re-enact an event from 1629 when the Speaker was pinned to his chair to prevent the prorogation of parliament. Cries of \u201cshame on you\u201d rose from the opposition benches as government MPs left the chamber. Labour MPs, who remained in their seats after government MPs and the Speaker had left to attend the House of Lords, sang the Red Flag, SNP MPs Scots Wha Hae and Plaid Cymru MPs Calon L\u00e2n, with harmonies. Russell-Moyle, the MP for Brighton Kemptown, is no stranger to parliamentary stunts. In December 2018, he grabbed the ceremonial mace after Theresa May postponed a key Brexit debate and vote on her withdrawal bill to the new year. The chaos unfolded in the early hours of Tuesday morning, after a day of high drama in which Boris Johnson lost his sixth parliamentary vote in as many days and Bercow announced his impending retirement as Speaker. As the prorogation got under way, Bercow expressed his anger, saying it was \u201cnot a normal prorogation\u201d. \u201cIt is not typical. It is not standard. It\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents, not just in the minds of many colleagues, but huge numbers of people outside, an act of executive fiat,\u201d he said. As Bercow spoke, opposition MPs held signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d and some attempted to block his way. One of those involved in the protest, Alex Sobel, Labour MP for Leeds North West, said the action \u201cechoes the action of members to try and prevent the speaker proroguing at the request of Charles I\u201d, referring to the 1629 incident when MPs, furious at the closure of parliament, left their seats and sat on the Speaker, preventing him from rising and closing the house, allowing MPs to pass a number of motions condemning the king. Bercow was not sat on, and was soon allowed to pass through the House of Commons to attend the House of Lords. The Speaker returned to the House of Commons to confirm the prorogation of parliament, with only a handful of Conservative MPs present and packed opposition benches. As parliament wrapped up at about 2am, opposition MPs lined up to shake Bercow\u2019s hand. Many MPs tweeted their anger, though the reason for their fury was split down party lines, with Conservative MPs appalled at the opposition MPs who had tried to stop the Speaker leaving his seat and opposition MPs angry at the proroguing of parliament. The pandemonium capped a rancorous day in parliament during which Johnson\u2019s options narrowed as parliament\u2019s bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October received royal assent and passed into law. Later the prime minister once again failed in his attempt to force an early general election after opposition MPs abstained from the vote and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he would not let his party walk into \u201ctraps laid by this prime minister\u201d. Parliament also voted by 311 to 302 for Johnson to publish Operation Yellowhammer documents detailing the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit plans, after a leaked version from early August warned of possible food and medicine shortages. The motion, brought by the former Tory MP Dominic Grieve, also directed Johnson to disclose messages relating to the suspension of parliament sent by his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings and various other aides on WhatsApp, Facebook, other social media and both their personal and professional phones. Grieve said he had information from public officials that such correspondence contained a \u201cscandal\u201d. But Downing Street sources suggested Johnson\u2019s advisers would resort to legal action rather than hand over their communications. Any refusal to comply could put them and the government in contempt of parliament.",

      "bodyText": "The Hong Kong government has denied persistent rumours that anti-government protesters may have died during a violent police clearance of a subway station last weekend. In the clarification \u2013 made in a rare joint conference between three Hong Kong emergency services departments and the city\u2019s subway operator \u2013 officials repeated for the sixth time in little over a week that no casualties occurred on 31 August at Prince Edward station. Rumours of possible deaths have endured in Hong Kong after 10 individuals were initially reported as injured at the subway station that night, before the figure was changed to seven. Despite denials from the government, residents have continued to leave funeral offerings at the entrance to the station. Yu Hoi-kwan, the senior superintendent of the police public relations branch, told reporters on Tuesday that rumours of deaths and a possible cover-up were \u201ctotally false\u201d. \u201cCertain people spread such malicious comments to slander the government and stir up grievances in society,\u201d she said. The fire services department said the confusion may have come from the fact that first responders initially miscounted the number of injured. Forty-six people were injured at protests that night in particularly tense clashes with police, according to the city\u2019s hospital authority. On 31 August, officers used pepper spray and batons on passengers and suspected protesters inside a subway car. The MTR corporation, which operates the subway, took the unusual step on Tuesday of releasing stills from CCTV cameras inside the station. The protests have become the worst political crisis faced by Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Persistent rumours reflect the deep mistrust with the Hong Kong administration that has emerged since protests began, with 64% of respondents reporting they did not trust the local government in a recent survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute. Among the rumours that have circulated over the past three months among protesters are reports ranging from an imminent Chinese invasion from across the Shenzhen border to allegations that Hong Kong police may have sexually assaulted female protesters. Many protesters believe that Chinese police officers are already embedded within the Hong Kong force or that they have attempted to act as agent provocateurs at protests. Mistrust extends across the political spectrum. On Monday, executive council member Fanny Law told a Hong Kong radio station that young women had been persuaded to offer sex to frontline protesters, prompting a political backlash. Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong leader, said Law\u2019s comments were \u201cher personal views\u201d, but advised residents to be \u201cextremely cautious\u201d in their approach to rumours that circulate online.

      "body": "<p>This may be an ironic question, but what does \u201csmart\u201d mean these days? We are surrounded by devices described as such, but do they all qualify? This week, I am trying a \u201csmart hydration reminder\u201d called Ulla (\u00a330, <a href=\"https://www.ulla.io/\" title=\"\">ulla.io</a>). It is a Tamagotchi-like bullet that clips to the side of any water bottle and flashes every hour or so, to remind you to drink. Hardly an iPhone, is it? It sounds more on a level with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/06/liquid-assets-how--business-bottled-water-went-mad\" title=\"\">Glac\u00e9au Smartwater</a> (Coca-Cola\u2019s bottled water that is distilled, removing minerals from the water, before having minerals added. Amazing times.)</p> <p>In fairness, there is more going on here than meets the eye. A proximity sensor, to be specific. It detects when you leave the bottle and then return to the area around it, at which point a little white light blinks furiously. There is also an accelerometer that knows when you have lifted the bottle for a sip, marking the event by pulsing the light once. I like this feature, which feels like appeasing a beast. The device knows when you last drank; before an hour is up, it will blink again, reminding you to take another sip.</p> <p>Do we need smart devices to remind us to attend to basic biological imperatives? In short, yes. Ulla could have been designed with me in mind. I drink a thimbleful of water a day, as a byproduct of eating gummy bears. There may also be water in cheese; who knows? No one has been able to confirm <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/tea-compared-to-water-for-hydration/\" title=\"\">whether tea is hydrating or dehydrating</a>, so I am in the dark on that one.

      "bodyText": "This may be an ironic question, but what does \u201csmart\u201d mean these days? We are surrounded by devices described as such, but do they all qualify? This week, I am trying a \u201csmart hydration reminder\u201d called Ulla (\u00a330, ulla.io). It is a Tamagotchi-like bullet that clips to the side of any water bottle and flashes every hour or so, to remind you to drink. Hardly an iPhone, is it? It sounds more on a level with Glac\u00e9au Smartwater (Coca-Cola\u2019s bottled water that is distilled, removing minerals from the water, before having minerals added. Amazing times.) In fairness, there is more going on here than meets the eye. A proximity sensor, to be specific. It detects when you leave the bottle and then return to the area around it, at which point a little white light blinks furiously. There is also an accelerometer that knows when you have lifted the bottle for a sip, marking the event by pulsing the light once. I like this feature, which feels like appeasing a beast. The device knows when you last drank; before an hour is up, it will blink again, reminding you to take another sip. Do we need smart devices to remind us to attend to basic biological imperatives? In short, yes. Ulla could have been designed with me in mind. I drink a thimbleful of water a day, as a byproduct of eating gummy bears. There may also be water in cheese; who knows? No one has been able to confirm whether tea is hydrating or dehydrating, so I am in the dark on that one. The fact is that I find drinking water boring, so I don\u2019t. I confuse thirst with hunger or tiredness, the upshot being that I am a slugabed with bad skin who can\u2019t cry. I know I should drink more, but it is no use telling me.

      "body": "<p>It had all ended so well. When Richard Gadd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/27/richard-gadd-wins-edinburgh-comedy-award\">won the Edinburgh Comedy award</a> three years ago with Monkey See Monkey Do, it wasn\u2019t just a professional triumph, but a very personal one. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/18/richard-gadd-comedian-waiting-for-gaddot-interview\">early multimedia comedy</a> traded in sick humour and grindhouse gags, and fixated \u2013 more, surely, than was healthy \u2013 on male sexuality and sexual violence. Then came this extraordinary confessional show about his experience, deeply sublimated in his previous work, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/22/richard-gadd-edinburgh-festival-fringe-comedy\">a victim of sexual assault</a>. It was emotionally naked, strayed far beyond humour\u2019s usual remit \u2013 and when it won the biggest prize in comedy, it was a redemption for Gadd and catharsis for his audience.</p> <p>Or so it seemed at the time. One of the many shocks in Gadd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/05/baby-reindeer-review-summerhall-edinburgh-festival-2019-richard-gadd\">new show Baby Reindeer</a> is that it steals away this happy ending. The demons of sexual abuse are not, it turns out, the only demons the Scotsman had to grapple with. Baby Reindeer \u2013 Gadd\u2019s first solo theatre show \u2013 is about his experience of being stalked. It\u2019s gone on for years. It is (give or take a legal technicality) still going on. And it entered a traumatic new stage only weeks after Gadd\u2019s 2016 award triumph, when he thought he\u2019d put the worst of his troubles behind him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d82afea68479e1af277db0c8b5506f0e00279d9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d82afea68479e1af277db0c8b5506f0e00279d9d/0_0_3200_4800/667.jpg\" alt=\"Edge-of-the-seat stuff \u2026 Gadd performs Baby Reindeer in Edinburgh this summer.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edge-of-the-seat stuff \u2026 Gadd performs Baby Reindeer in Edinburgh this summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat was the worst part,\u201d he says now. \u201cIt felt like I\u2019d expunged the demons of one person who had caused me so much grief, only so that she [his stalker] could take centre stage in his place. It felt so <em>awfully</em> ironic.\u201d The 30-year-old is talking at the Edinburgh fringe, at which Baby Reindeer was both sell-out and talking point. For legal reasons, he must be careful what he says \u2013 but the gripping, gruelling show speaks volumes about the harassment he\u2019s suffered. It\u2019s edge-of-the-seat stuff, it\u2019s a plea for a new legal approach to stalking \u2013 and it\u2019s a murky account of two damaged souls unable to escape one another\u2019s grip.</p> <p>That moral muddiness is what gives the show its particular charge. Gadd almost staged it a year ago, but postponed \u2013 because he got an acting job on BBC teen thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/nov/06/meninism-metoo-and-clique-teen-tvs-most-political-show-returns\">Clique</a>, but also because \u201cI hadn\u2019t quite grasped it yet. If I\u2019d rushed it a year ago, it would have just been a victim narrative. And everyone would have come out saying \u2018oh you\u2019re so brave, and well done for doing this\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Which is emphatically <em>not</em> the show he went on to make. \u201cIt would be unfair to say she was an awful person and I was a victim,\u201d says Gadd. \u201cThat didn\u2019t feel true.\u201d</p> <p>One complicating factor is gender: Gadd\u2019s story reverses the usual male/female roles in harassment narratives. While there were points when he feared for his personal safety (\u201cAbsolutely. Loads of times\u201d), he was physically stronger than his tormentor. But emotionally \u2013 not so much. In Baby Reindeer, Gadd portrays himself as a very troubled man, failing to come to terms with his assault, wrestling with his sexuality, weirdly flattered by the interest of this woman he first meets in his casual job working at a bar. In the audience, we know she\u2019s trouble. So it\u2019s excruciating to watch Gadd, time after time, make disastrous choices about how to deal with her.</p> <p>\u201cI did loads of things wrong,\u201d he admits, \u201cand made the situation worse.

      "bodyText": "It had all ended so well. When Richard Gadd won the Edinburgh Comedy award three years ago with Monkey See Monkey Do, it wasn\u2019t just a professional triumph, but a very personal one. His early multimedia comedy traded in sick humour and grindhouse gags, and fixated \u2013 more, surely, than was healthy \u2013 on male sexuality and sexual violence. Then came this extraordinary confessional show about his experience, deeply sublimated in his previous work, as a victim of sexual assault. It was emotionally naked, strayed far beyond humour\u2019s usual remit \u2013 and when it won the biggest prize in comedy, it was a redemption for Gadd and catharsis for his audience. Or so it seemed at the time. One of the many shocks in Gadd\u2019s new show Baby Reindeer is that it steals away this happy ending. The demons of sexual abuse are not, it turns out, the only demons the Scotsman had to grapple with. Baby Reindeer \u2013 Gadd\u2019s first solo theatre show \u2013 is about his experience of being stalked. It\u2019s gone on for years. It is (give or take a legal technicality) still going on. And it entered a traumatic new stage only weeks after Gadd\u2019s 2016 award triumph, when he thought he\u2019d put the worst of his troubles behind him. \u201cThat was the worst part,\u201d he says now. \u201cIt felt like I\u2019d expunged the demons of one person who had caused me so much grief, only so that she [his stalker] could take centre stage in his place. It felt so awfully ironic.\u201d The 30-year-old is talking at the Edinburgh fringe, at which Baby Reindeer was both sell-out and talking point. For legal reasons, he must be careful what he says \u2013 but the gripping, gruelling show speaks volumes about the harassment he\u2019s suffered. It\u2019s edge-of-the-seat stuff, it\u2019s a plea for a new legal approach to stalking \u2013 and it\u2019s a murky account of two damaged souls unable to escape one another\u2019s grip. That moral muddiness is what gives the show its particular charge. Gadd almost staged it a year ago, but postponed \u2013 because he got an acting job on BBC teen thriller Clique, but also because \u201cI hadn\u2019t quite grasped it yet. If I\u2019d rushed it a year ago, it would have just been a victim narrative. And everyone would have come out saying \u2018oh you\u2019re so brave, and well done for doing this\u2019.\u201d Which is emphatically not the show he went on to make. \u201cIt would be unfair to say she was an awful person and I was a victim,\u201d says Gadd. \u201cThat didn\u2019t feel true.\u201d One complicating factor is gender: Gadd\u2019s story reverses the usual male/female roles in harassment narratives. While there were points when he feared for his personal safety (\u201cAbsolutely. Loads of times\u201d), he was physically stronger than his tormentor. But emotionally \u2013 not so much. In Baby Reindeer, Gadd portrays himself as a very troubled man, failing to come to terms with his assault, wrestling with his sexuality, weirdly flattered by the interest of this woman he first meets in his casual job working at a bar. In the audience, we know she\u2019s trouble. So it\u2019s excruciating to watch Gadd, time after time, make disastrous choices about how to deal with her. \u201cI did loads of things wrong,\u201d he admits, \u201cand made the situation worse. I wasn\u2019t a perfect person [back then], so there\u2019s no point saying I was. And I know as I\u2019m doing those sections that people are thinking I\u2019m not a nice person \u2013 which make them difficult to perform.\u201d The show has been only lightly fictionalised, says Gadd. \u201cThe skeleton of the story is absolutely true,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t this morbidly thrilling in real life. \u201cThe feeling you get most of all when you\u2019re getting harassed is relentless tediousness and frustration. I didn\u2019t want the audience to feel that.\u201d With director Jon Brittain, Gadd has created a vice-like production that depicts his dialogues with \u201cMartha\u201d. It scrolls their text and email exchanges above our heads (Gadd received 41,000 emails over three years), broadcasts her abusive voicemails, and plays vocal testimonies from bit-part players (Gadd\u2019s parents, his landlord, his girlfriend) in the drama. It also dramatises his desperate encounters with the police, who tell Gadd they can\u2019t help him until Martha issues an explicit threat of violence. \u201cI was getting told off for harassing the police about being harassed,\u201d says Gadd. In Baby Reindeer, the law starts to feel like Martha\u2019s accomplice in the abuse, as Gadd is forced \u2013 at the cost of his fragile confidence \u2013 to listen to hours of insulting voicemail daily, sifting it for the unguarded remark that might tip Martha\u2019s behaviour into criminality. \u201cI\u2019ve been through two police investigations in my life,\u201d says Gadd, \u201cand they\u2019ve both been hilarious, fly-on-the-wall terrible. Honestly my advice to someone who ever thought of pressing charges would be: it\u2019s a fucking nightmare process, and it takes years.\u201d It\u2019s his frustration at how stalking is policed, he says \u2013 and he cites the recent high-profile case of Shana Grice\u2019s murder by her ex-boyfriend \u2013 that compelled Gadd to bring his story to the stage.

An honor, Mr President.\u201d Legend tweeted: \u201cImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody \u2013 ANYBODY \u2013 will praise you.\u201d The exchanges drew the attention of the former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, a once vocal supporter of Trump who has belatedly emerged as a critic. He called Trump\u2019s behavior \u201cdespicable\u201d. Scaramucci told CNN: \u201cHave any of the other presidents in recent history \u2013 modern history \u2013 gone after their private citizens whether they\u2019re celebrities or not celebrities?\u201d Trump signed the First Step Act in December. The act will reduce mandatory minimum sentences in certain cases. More than 3,100 people will be released from federal prison under the law.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has demanded Scott Morrison sack the energy minister Angus Taylor after revealing his comments in a radio interview where Taylor acknowledged he was standing up for farmers, including \u201cme and other family members\u201d, in the grasslands saga. Taylor faced a censure motion in parliament on Tuesday \u2013 promptly gagged by the Morrison government \u2013 after the energy minister\u2019s comments on 26 July were presented by the opposition during question time. The minister, who faced questions about his conduct during the July parliamentary sittings, told ABC Illawarra at the height of that debate that he had intervened about the technical aspects of the grasslands listing, but \u201cI make absolutely no apologies for standing up for farmers in my region \u2013 that includes me and other family members\u201d. \u201cIt is my job to stand up for us,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not standing up for farmers in the federal parliament, then who is?\u201d Under sustained questioning during the last parliamentary sitting period, Taylor told the parliament it was a conversation with a Yass farmer \u2013 who he did not name \u2013 and not the interests of his farming family, that spurred him to seek briefings with the environment department. In parliament on Tuesday, Taylor said the point he was making in the July radio interview \u201cwas that me and my family are farmers in my electorate\u201d and being a farmer in his own electorate was not a crime. A Guardian Australia investigation revealed in June that Taylor met with senior environment officials and the office of the then environment minister Josh Frydenberg in 2017 to discuss the listing of the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highland as critically endangered under national environment law. The meeting took place at the same time investigations were under way into whether the company Jam Land Pty Ltd illegally cleared land containing the grasses in the Monaro region of New South Wales. Richard Taylor is one of the directors of Jam Land and Angus Taylor himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After Angus Taylor\u2019s lobbying, Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice on whether protection of the grasslands could be watered down and if that change had to be published. Labor and the Greens have accused both ministers of misconduct but attempts to establish a Senate inquiry into the events have been blocked by the government and One Nation. Taylor and the department have repeatedly stated the compliance case was not discussed at the meeting. Taylor has previously said the meeting was to discuss the grasslands listing because it was an issue of concern for his constituents in Hume. A hearing last month of the Senate\u2019s inquiry into fauna extinctions was told Taylor did not declare his business or personal interest in Jam Land at the time of the meeting with department officials in March 2017 and that one of the senior officials present did not take notes. Asic records show Taylor\u2019s interest in Jam Land was recorded in May 2017, after the departmental meeting. However the department was aware of the family connection when the meeting took place. Moving a censure motion on Tuesday, Anthony Albanese accused Taylor of using his public office to advance his private interests and deliberately misleading the House. The Labor leader called on Taylor to resign \u201cand if he will not, I call on prime minister to immediately sack the minister\u201d. Morrison blasted back, declaring \u201cI will not cop lectures on integrity from the NSW Labor party, Mr Speaker\u201d. He said the build-up to Tuesday\u2019s censure motion was \u201cthe lamest build-up I have seen to that type of a question in this place before\u201d. Referencing recent controversy about Labor\u2019s fundraising in the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption, Morrison said the \u201cLiberal party and the National party will not be lectured by someone who used to work in the NSW branch of the Labor party\u201d. \u201c[Albanese] had a desk in the office, Mr Speaker, in the Sussex Street headquarters of a party that stinks with corruption, where they get money in plastic bags and count it out on the table,\u201d Morrison said.",

May\u2019s resignation honours list heaps rewards on those who worked in Downing Street during her three-year tenure, despite her having previously poured scorn on cronyism under David Cameron. The CBEs for Timothy and Hill are likely to provoke the most criticism, as they left their jobs following May\u2019s disastrous 2017 election following anger about their abrasive manner towards MPs and staff. The former prime minister once famously gave a speech suggesting Cameron\u2019s decision to award a knighthood to his ex-communications director Craig Oliver made her want to be sick. Her aides also briefed media in 2016 that she wanted to draw a line under the cronyism of the Cameron era, reserving honours for people for unsung heroes who have served their local communities. However, the former prime minister\u2019s list gives awards to at least 20 of her former advisers, including a knighthood for Robbie Gibb, her director of communications, and a peerage for Gavin Barwell, the former MP who was her chief of staff. Three more of her long-term aides \u2013 Stephen Parkinson, Liz Sanderson and Joanna Penn \u2013 will be sent to the House of Lords. Several financial backers were also rewarded with peerages, including David Brownlow, who has donated more than \u00a32m to the Conservatives, including cash for May\u2019s own Maidenhead office, and two other Tory donors, Rami Ranger and Zameer Choudrey. Another major Tory donor, Ehud Sheleg, who has given the party almost \u00a33m, was given a knighthood. Olly Robbins, May\u2019s EU adviser, who was loathed by Brexiters, and George Holingbery, her former parliamentary aide, were both made knight commanders of the order of St Michael and St George. It emerged on Monday that Robbins is to take a sabbatical holding a visiting fellowship at Oxford University before leaving the civil service to join Goldman Sachs\u2019 investment banking division. John Mann, who announced that he was standing down as a Labour MP this week to concentrate full time on his role as the government\u2019s antisemitism tsar, was elevated to the Lords as a non-affiliated peer. May also gave a peerage to Sir Kim Darroch, the former ambassador to Washington, who stepped aside following a row about leaked criticism of US president Donald Trump. Several MPs who have been staunch defenders of May were also rewarded with honours, including Brandon Lewis and Patrick McLoughlin, two former party chairmen, George Hollingbery, her former parliamentary aide, and Charles Walker, a backbencher who decried the party\u2019s treatment of her. The lowest honours, British Empire Medals, were given to a Downing Street housekeeper and chef at Chequers, the prime minister\u2019s grace-and-favour country retreat. Ian Lavery, chairman of the Labour party, said it came as \u201cno surprise that big Tory donors and No 10 cronies are being honoured yet again\u201d. \u201cThe Tories only care about looking after their own and will only stand up for the wealthy few who fund them,\u201d he said.

Labour\u2019s nominations for new peers include Christine Blower, a former general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, John Hendy, an honorary professor at University College London, and Debbie Wilcox, the leader of Newport city council and Welsh local government association.

Paramedics later noticed a narrowing of her pupils that they mistakenly attributed to illicit drugs. Day\u2019s blood alcohol level was above 0.2 when tested at Bendigo hospital at 11pm that night. She did not have illicit drugs in her system. Associate professor John Laidlaw, a neurosurgeon at Royal Melbourne hospital who was called as an expert medical witness, said that Day had a low platelet count and a reduced ability for her blood to coagulate due to her impaired liver function. \u201cBoth those factors are predisposed to ongoing bleeding from very small vessels,\u201d he said, adding that would also affect Day\u2019s ability to recover after surgery. Laidlaw said that a small haematoma would have formed within minutes of the 4.51pm impact, and this \u201cwould have expanded to form a significant haematoma over a very short period of time\u201d, identified as \u201cbetween 15 to 90 minutes\u201d. About 90 minutes after the fall, Laidlaw said, Day was showing clear signs of hemiparesis in the loss of function of the right side of her body. He said that is shown in CCTV footage from the cell after 6.39pm, after Day has fallen off the bed and appears unable to move her right arm. Laidlaw said that Day would have been affected by dysphasia \u201cvery early\u201d after sustaining the injury at 4.51pm, which he said would mean she would be unable to find the right words to respond to a question, and may not be able to understand what was said to her. Police told the inquest last week that Day gave a \u201cverbal response\u201d by saying \u201cyes\u201d to a question in two welfare checks conducted after she was injured, at 7.35pm and 6.43pm, and was able to communicate with them when they went into the cell at 8.05pm. Laidlaw told counsel for the Day family, Peter Morrissey SC, that given the nature of Day\u2019s injury, it is unlikely that a permanent brain injury could have been averted by relieving pressure on her brain. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got bleeding inside the trauma of large enough to cause secondary damage to the brain, it usually does cause permanent injury,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case the primary haematoma itself is enough to cause permanent injury to the brain.\u201d The inquest continues.",

      "bodyText": "Unprecedented levels of student activism are set to erupt this month when angry students, fed up with the turmoil around Brexit, arrive for freshers\u2019 week, student unions say. This term sees the arrival at university of three whole years\u2019 worth of students \u2013 first, second and third years \u2013 who were too young to vote in the European referendum in 2016. Latest polling suggests students would be more likely to vote in an election now than at any time in the past 15 years. Anti-Brexit rallies and debates are scheduled at universities across the UK in the next month, and started yesterday with a protest demanding a people\u2019s vote at Edinburgh University, one of the first to return after the summer. Andrew Wilson, president of Edinburgh\u2019s student union and an organiser of the rally, says: \u201cThere is a growing anger among young people that they haven\u2019t had a say on Brexit. While MPs argue in Westminster it\u2019s us who will lose. This is our future.\u201d Even before students arrive on campus, student unions are contacting them on social media about registering to vote, and they say they will step up their campaigns during freshers\u2019 week and beyond. Most campaigns have the firm backing of vice-chancellors, who fear losing European staff, students and research cash after Brexit. Moreover, unlike in the past two general elections, universities now have an explicit legal obligation to encourage students to sign up to vote, as a condition of being accredited by the Office for Students. Molli Cleaver, president of Reading University\u2019s student union says: \u201cBefore the summer a lot of students were fed up with Brexit going on so long. That is changing to anger. Students want to be heard.\u201d The Conservatives lost Reading East to Labour in 2017 for the first time in 12 years \u2013 proof, Reading\u2019s students\u2019 union says, that they can make a difference by voting. \u201cWe were definitely a contributing factor,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are focusing on getting across the message that although you might feel powerless, collectively you have power to change things,\u201d she says. Richard Brooks, a co-founder of For Our Future\u2019s Sake, a national student campaign for a people\u2019s vote on Brexit, says it is struggling to keep on top of all the activist events scheduled in UK universities and colleges. \u201cIn 2016 it felt like Brexit happened to young people and we should have been more engaged. But polling is showing that young people who didn\u2019t get to vote are one of the most exercised groups in terms of Brexit. This generation has had enough of the political chaos.\u201d Students are often caricatured as apathetic. But research last month by the pollsters YouthSight, which has tracked the student vote since 2004, found around 80% would now be likely to vote, compared with an average of 64% since 2005. The poll also found that although Labour was still the clear favourite, its popularity had halved since last year. Around 38% of students said they would vote Labour, down from a record high of more than 70% in February 2018; 19% said they would vote Lib Dem; 18% would back the Greens; and the Conservatives were on a record low of 12%. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: \u201cIn some seats where there are a large number of students in one constituency, and where they vote differently from the local population, their vote does really matter.\u201d He cites Cambridge, where he stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate in 2010, as a classic case.

And I think they do care about democracy and about Brexit,\u201d he says. Students flexed their political muscles during the 2017 general election, when high student turnout helped shape the outcome in a number of seats. At Kent University, students queued around the block to vote and helped unseat an MP in a constituency that had been Tory since the first world war. Kent, which markets itself as the UK\u2019s European university and has campuses in Paris, Brussels, Rome and Athens, is expecting student temperatures to be high when they return next week. Prof Jeremy Carrette, the university\u2019s dean for Europe, who has been working closely with the student union on student voter engagement, says: \u201cBrexit has always been a huge issue for us. We look out on the white cliffs and see Europe.

And the fact we could sneak it around and do it practically anywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>West, now 20, has tried to quit three times. During her first cold turkey attempt, she said she experienced suicidal thoughts, \u201cbouts of rage\u201d and mood swings, according to her attorneys. She has bought cigarettes when she could not afford Juul pods, and recently tried a nicotine patch to quit.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe represent individuals who suffered from strokes, seizures, respiratory problems,\u201d said Joseph Van Zandt, an attorney with Beasley Allen representing West in a lawsuit filed in Alabama.</p> \n<p>Little is known about vaping\u2019s health impacts, especially long-term, though researchers believe it is a better option than smoking. There is debate in the scientific community about whether the devices encourage young people to try cigarettes. Juul Labs did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe types of cases to come will really start to change, and you\u2019re going to see more and more catastrophic injury cases in addition to these [addiction] cases,\u201d Van Zandt said, referring to Juul lawsuits as \u201ctobacco 2.0\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"42359eb8-8fc8-49d0-b206-a73751e3fdaf\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/riIQ4KtKGtU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beasley Allen alone is handling more than 200 clients\u2019 vaping suits filed in state and federal courts. Florida\u2019s largest law firm, Morgan &amp; Morgan, filed a class action suit against Juul for \u201cimproperly targeting children with e-cigarettes\u201d, and another Chicago law firm filed a class action against the company this summer.</p> \n<p>The cases are also ramping up amid a vaping-linked health scare. More than 400 possible cases of a severe, pneumonia-like lung ailment have been identified in 33 states and one US territory. No single manufacturer or product has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/06/vaping-illness-breathing-us-health-officials\">identified as the source of the problem</a>, but neither have any been ruled out.</p> \n<p>Vaping has become so common in schools some students call lavatories the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/helpless-to-the-draw-of-nicotine-doctors-parents-and-schools-grapple-with-teens-addicted-to-e-cigarettes/2019/07/25/e1e8ac9c-830a-11e9-933d-7501070ee669_story.html\">Juul room</a>\u201d. In one case being handled by Van Zandt\u2019s law firm, one mother\u2019s twin daughters\u2019 Juul-fueled nicotine addiction became so severe she started home-schooling them. As students return this fall, some school administrators have begun to publicly weigh whether students caught vaping should be <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/301f89091f4944fcb1f95f5ab6723a13\">punished or referred to rehab</a>.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Juul Labs called the lawsuits \u201cessentially copy and paste unfounded allegations\u201d already raised in other lawsuits.</p> \n<p>\u201cJuul Labs is committed to eliminating combustible cigarettes, the number one cause of preventable death in the world,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOur product has always only been intended to be a viable alternative for the 1 billion current adult smokers in the world. We have never marketed to youth and do not want any non-nicotine users to try our products.\u201d The company also said it launched an anti-teen vaping initiative.</p> \n<p>In an example of how large the litigation could become, a federal judge in California is now hearing whether the suits should be grouped into one court, like lawsuits filed against opioid manufacturers. The tactic, called multi-district litigation, allows one court to hear cases from around the country, companies to settle cases with thousands of plaintiffs simultaneously, and plaintiffs\u2019 cases to move quicker.</p> \n<p>Van Zandt pointed out the suits are against some of the same big tobacco companies sued in the 1990s, including Altria, formerly known as Philip Morris, which bought a more than one-third stake in Juul last year.</p> \n<p>The teen vaping \u201cepidemic\u201d, as the US surgeon general called it, has led to a barrage of criticism of the company, including an e-cigarette sales ban in the company\u2019s hometown of San Francisco. Michigan last week banned flavored vape pods in an emergency declaration, citing the recent spate of unexplained and severe lung illness linked to vaping.</p> \n<p>An investigation of Juul\u2019s social media marketing by the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838795/federal-trade-commission-ftc-juul-investigation\">US Federal Trade Commission</a> was revealed in August, amid scrutiny of ads just a few years ago that targeted kids with colorful backgrounds and youthful Juul-using models. Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an unannounced raid on their headquarters, although it has so far failed to regulate vaping products.</p> \n<p>Recently, Juul\u2019s CEO, Kevin Burns, said its product is meant for adults, and warned in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/juul-ceo-kevin-burns-tells-non-smokers-not-to-vape-or-use-his-companys-product/\">CBS This Morning</a>: \u201cDon\u2019t vape. Don\u2019t use Juul.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although Juul is pitched as a reduced-harm device for adult smokers, it has not been approved for this use by the FDA. On Monday, the FDA sent a warning letter to Juul, that said the company had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/09/fda-warns-juul-for-marketing-with-unproven-safety-claims-1486761\">ignored the law</a>\u201d by making unapproved safety claims, including in schools. A <a href=\"https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2019/06/18/tobaccocontrol-2019-054952\">recent study in the BMJ</a> also suggested Juul is being used by smokers in addition to cigarettes, rather than as a replacement.</p> \n<p>A wave of teen vaping has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/11/can-we-stop-americas-teen-vaping-epidemic-arriving-in-britain-\">not hit the UK</a>, where Juuls have less than one-third of the nicotine potency they have in the US, and where the devices only recently went on sale in stores.</p> \n<p>The actions come as Altria is now reportedly in advanced talks to merge with the global maker of Marlboro, Lausanne-based Philip Morris International. Despite the existential threat of 1990s-era litigation, both companies are doing well. Altria made a $12bn profit in 2018.</p>",

Florida\u2019s largest law firm, Morgan &amp; Morgan, filed a class action suit against Juul for \u201cimproperly targeting children with e-cigarettes\u201d, and another Chicago law firm filed a class action against the company this summer. The cases are also ramping up amid a vaping-linked health scare. More than 400 possible cases of a severe, pneumonia-like lung ailment have been identified in 33 states and one US territory. No single manufacturer or product has been identified as the source of the problem, but neither have any been ruled out. Vaping has become so common in schools some students call lavatories the \u201cJuul room\u201d. In one case being handled by Van Zandt\u2019s law firm, one mother\u2019s twin daughters\u2019 Juul-fueled nicotine addiction became so severe she started home-schooling them. As students return this fall, some school administrators have begun to publicly weigh whether students caught vaping should be punished or referred to rehab. A spokesperson for Juul Labs called the lawsuits \u201cessentially copy and paste unfounded allegations\u201d already raised in other lawsuits. \u201cJuul Labs is committed to eliminating combustible cigarettes, the number one cause of preventable death in the world,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOur product has always only been intended to be a viable alternative for the 1 billion current adult smokers in the world. We have never marketed to youth and do not want any non-nicotine users to try our products.\u201d The company also said it launched an anti-teen vaping initiative. In an example of how large the litigation could become, a federal judge in California is now hearing whether the suits should be grouped into one court, like lawsuits filed against opioid manufacturers. The tactic, called multi-district litigation, allows one court to hear cases from around the country, companies to settle cases with thousands of plaintiffs simultaneously, and plaintiffs\u2019 cases to move quicker. Van Zandt pointed out the suits are against some of the same big tobacco companies sued in the 1990s, including Altria, formerly known as Philip Morris, which bought a more than one-third stake in Juul last year. The teen vaping \u201cepidemic\u201d, as the US surgeon general called it, has led to a barrage of criticism of the company, including an e-cigarette sales ban in the company\u2019s hometown of San Francisco. Michigan last week banned flavored vape pods in an emergency declaration, citing the recent spate of unexplained and severe lung illness linked to vaping. An investigation of Juul\u2019s social media marketing by the US Federal Trade Commission was revealed in August, amid scrutiny of ads just a few years ago that targeted kids with colorful backgrounds and youthful Juul-using models. Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an unannounced raid on their headquarters, although it has so far failed to regulate vaping products. Recently, Juul\u2019s CEO, Kevin Burns, said its product is meant for adults, and warned in an interview with CBS This Morning: \u201cDon\u2019t vape. Don\u2019t use Juul.\u201d Although Juul is pitched as a reduced-harm device for adult smokers, it has not been approved for this use by the FDA. On Monday, the FDA sent a warning letter to Juul, that said the company had \u201cignored the law\u201d by making unapproved safety claims, including in schools. A recent study in the BMJ also suggested Juul is being used by smokers in addition to cigarettes, rather than as a replacement. A wave of teen vaping has not hit the UK, where Juuls have less than one-third of the nicotine potency they have in the US, and where the devices only recently went on sale in stores. The actions come as Altria is now reportedly in advanced talks to merge with the global maker of Marlboro, Lausanne-based Philip Morris International. Despite the existential threat of 1990s-era litigation, both companies are doing well. Altria made a $12bn profit in 2018.",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing. If you\u2019d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories It promised to be a big week, and it was. On the House of Commons\u2019 first day back after the summer recess, Boris Johnson was humiliatingly defeated when MPs \u2013 including 21 Conservative rebels \u2013 voted by 328 to 301 to seize control of the parliamentary agenda. The prime minister responded by purging the Tory rebels \u2013 including heavyweights such as Ken Clarke, Nicholas Soames, Philip Hammond and David Gauke \u2013 as he had promised, and said he would ask parliament to support a snap October election. The rebels said later his threats had boosted them and Johnson went on to suffer three more defeats: the bill drawn up by opposition and Tory rebels to block a no-deal Brexit easily cleared its second and third readings, and MPs then blocked Johnson\u2019s attempt to secure an early election, which failed to get the two-thirds majority required. With anger rising among moderate Conservatives at the treatment of the rebels, the House of Lords agreed \u2013 after some filibustering by Brexit-supporting peers \u2013 to send the bill back to the Commons by Friday evening, and eventually did so without amendment, meaning it became law. The bill, intended to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, obliges the prime minister to seek an extension from Brussels if a new deal has not been agreed by 19 October \u2013 which Johnson said during an at times rambling speech that he would rather \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than do. Johnson has good reason to be rattled. In addition to the parliamentary defeats, his younger brother, Jo, citing a conflict between family loyalty and the national interest, announced he was quitting the cabinet and stepping down as an MP. Jo Johnson was later followed by Amber Rudd. Gauke and Hammond mauled the prime minister, warning that he risks losing millions of Conservative voters and turning the party into a Brexit sect, and Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, after long hesitation, agreed with other opposition parties to block an election until after an extension was secured. Johnson thus finds himself cornered, with speculation that he might consider breaking the law \u2013 a course of action that legal experts (and Corbyn) were quick to warn could land him in jail or trigger a constitutional crisis. After a weekend of continuing protests, Tory rebels warned that their new law could not be circumvented and a former supreme court judge said one possible government wheeze to get round it \u2013 writing two letters to the European council \u2013 would be illegal. The government\u2019s only reprieves came in the courts: in Edinburgh and at the high court in London, judges ruled the prime minister\u2019s highly controversial decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was lawful. Throughout the week, Johnson and his ministers continued to claim that talks with Brussels on excising the backstop from the withdrawal agreement \u2013 and other demands \u2013 were progressing well, even if the EU was not being as helpful as it might. The EU27 begged to differ. The prime minister\u2019s first concrete proposal for replacing the backstop \u2013 an all-Ireland food standards zone \u2013 hit the Brussels buffers after a \u201cdisastrous\u201d meeting with his envoy, David Frost, while EU officials accused the government of reneging on pledges to uphold the Good Friday agreement. France later threatened to veto any further Brexit extension unless the situation changed significantly, and the Dutch trade minister warned bluntly that after recent \u201cbreathtaking\u201d developments in London, the EU was fast running out of patience with London. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, warned Johnson there could be no \u201cclean break\u201d from the EU, with further fraught negotiations to come if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal. Nonetheless, amid chaotic scenes in the Commons Johnson went ahead with his decision to prorogue parliament until 14 October after the bill blocking a no-deal Brexit became law. The prime minister may however take some comfort from the knowledge that, should he ever get the election MPs again denied him on Monday night, he could well win it: the latest polls show that despite everything, the Tories have a 10-point lead over Labour. Don\u2019t write off Johnson just yet. What next It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.

The extreme events that our community has been talking about for decades are now becoming part of our lived experience, season after season, year after year across the entire planet.

Barely a week after sweltering through an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead author meeting discussing the UN group\u2019s sixth global climate assessment report during an unseasonable European heatwave, it\u2019s been surreal to return home to find much of Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard engulfed in unprecedented bushfires crisis.

Nine of Australia\u2019s 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and that long-term trend shows no sign of turning around any time soon. As a scientist, what I find particularly disturbing about the current conditions is that world heritage rainforest areas such as the Lamington national park in the Gold Coast hinterland are now burning. This region of eastern Australia is part of the Gondwana rainforests of Australia, which contains the largest remaining stands of subtropical rainforest in the world, and the most significant areas of warm temperate rainforest in the country. These usually moss-drenched forests are packed with the oldest elements of the world\u2019s ferns, and primitive plant families dating back to the Jurassic era, some 200m to 145m years ago. Although these remarkable rainforests have clung on since the age of the dinosaurs, searing heat and lower rainfall is starting to see these wet areas dry out for longer periods of the year, increasing bushfire risk in these precious ecosystems. It has been hard to watch the news coverage of these exceptionally rare rainforests burning. Just like the dying off of 50% of the Great Barrier Reef, the potential loss of these areas is something I never thought I would witness in my lifetime. The world has justifiably been grieving the recent accelerated destruction of the Amazon, but fewer Australians appreciate our own ecological disaster unfolding on our doorstep. The Gondwana rainforests of Australia are evolutionary relics that have immeasurable conservation value to the global community. If rapid climate change destabilises the cool and wet conditions needed for these ancient rainforests to survive, they may be lost to humanity forever. Although there are natural seasonal fluctuations in the Indian and Southern Ocean that are influencing the dry and windy conditions we are currently experiencing, all of Australia\u2019s weather and climate variability is now occurring in a world that is 1\u00b0C warmer than it was since pre-industrial times. The human fingerprint on Australian temperatures has been clearly detected since 1950. This means that all natural variability is now being modified by human influences on the climate system, leading to changes in observed climate variability and extremes. Since the 1970s, there has been an increase in extreme fire weather, and a longer fire season, across large parts of the country. Under the world\u2019s business-as-usual emissions scenario we are currently on, Australia\u2019s average temperature will typically increase 4\u00b0C by the end of the century.

As we begin to drift away from the safe shores of historical variability, the only certainty is that life in the \u201cnew normal\u201d will be outside the range of human experience. All of this begs the obvious question: what will it take for Australians to wake up to the climate crisis we now face? The harsh reality is that this event is likely to be forgotten once the fires are finally out and the media interest has moved on. Despite being one of the worst bushfires in Australian history, alarmingly, the Victorian Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, which killed 173 people, destroyed around 2,000 homes and incinerated millions of plants and animals, didn\u2019t serve as a wake-up call. The deeper we sink into denial, the more we commit ourselves to a reality where our children learn about environmental icons such as the Great Barrier Reef and our magnificent rainforests through history books, instead of being able to experience their wonder for themselves.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers).

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, has said that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow if climate change is manmade\u201d. Clarifying earlier comments that the question is \u201cirrelevant\u201d when considering the Coalition government\u2019s response to intensifying bushfires, he told Guardian Australia he was unsure about the causes of the climate crisis but wanted to give the country the tools to adapt. The remarks by the minister for water resources, drought, natural disaster and emergency management are likely to anger political opponents, including the Greens who have targeted Littleproud and fellow members of the National party for refusing to acknowledge a link between human-induced climate change and bushfires. Littleproud\u2019s position was supported by the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, the minister for resources and northern Australia, Matt Canavan, and the environment minister, Sussan Ley, all of who denied knowledge of or downplayed the link. Early spring bushfires in Queensland may go on for weeks, authorities said, while firefighters on Tuesday were battling more than 50 fires in New South Wales. The overall fire danger index has increased for most of southern Australia over the past 40 years and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre says the trend is expected to continue. On Monday, Littleproud told ABC\u2019s Radio National that Australia has been \u201cadapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we\u2019ll have to continue to do that and do that with the best science we\u2019ve got available\u201d. When asked whether human-induced climate change is making bushfires more intense, Littleproud replied: \u201cWe\u2019re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we\u2019ll continue to equip our service workers \u2026 Whether it\u2019s manmade or not is irrelevant.\u201d The minister suggested there were \u201cextremes from both sides\u201d of the debate which should be about \u201cdo we want to breathe healthy air\u201d. He said his job was to ensure emergency services \u201care given the tools and resources they need, [and] they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe\u201d. Asked by Guardian Australia why he had avoided taking a position on the effect of manmade climate change, Littleproud replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if climate change is manmade. \u201cI\u2019m about practical outcomes, whether that\u2019s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cI am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate.\u201d On Monday, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, used Senate question time to target Littleproud for his original answer, suggesting he was in effect dismissing the concerns of emergency services chiefs who have warned of climate change\u2019s contribution to fires. The agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, rebuked Di Natale for \u201cpoliticising bushfires which right now are affecting landholders, homes, environmental assets and farmers in communities in Queensland and north-east NSW\u201d. McKenzie \u2013 answering on behalf of Littleproud \u2013 said the minister and she had been \u201cvery upfront \u2026 about the fact that the climate is changing\u201d. \u201cThere is variability around the climate.\u201d Asked if she accepted that human-induced climate change is making bushfires worse, McKenzie replied: \u201cOur government has made very clear that we take climate change seriously.\u201d On Tuesday Di Natale repeated the tactic \u2013 this time targeting Canavan, who again accused the Greens of using the tragedy in \u201ccombustible fashion\u201d to further the party\u2019s own political cause. Canavan quoted a NSW environment department report which suggested there was \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d of the impact of climate change on bushfire risk, although the report concluded it will likely increase bushfire risk. Canavan said the Liberal-National Coalition supported \u201csensible responses to climate change that included support for the high-quality coal and gas that we produce in this country\u201d. \u201cIt is through the high-quality production of energy that we will respond to climate change and reduce emissions,\u201d he said. Ley told ABC Radio that she doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat caused this particular fire on this particular day\u201d. \u201cWe have always lived on a continent which has been ravaged by fires, I am not going to become an expert on what is causing the fires,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sure it is related to climate change, to what degree and under what circumstances, and what actions we could be taking, there is a whole range of other conversations around that.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, four Coalition MPs raised the issue of drought and natural disasters in the joint party room, urging practical options to help regional businesses including shops that are not eligible for drought assistance. Several others raised the issue of insurance in north Queensland, which is subject to monsoonal troughs and severe tropical cyclones. The MPs complained of exorbitant premium rises of between 300% and 500% and argued the situation is a market failure with insurers warning it is no longer profitable to insure areas including Townsville.

The Speaker, John Bercow, condemned it as an \u201cact of executive fiat\u201d.

The exit of Tories was accompanied by cries of \u201cShame on you!\u201d from those remaining behind, some of whom held up placards saying they were silenced. Renditions of Red Flag, Jerusalem, Flower of Scotland and Bread of Heaven were also sung before Bercow returned to address the remaining MPs, confirm the prorogation and adjourn the Commons. The mood turned turned more festive as MPs filed out, exchanging greetings, witticisms, handshakes and hugs with Bercow as they left.</p> \n<p>Earlier there was a parting indignity for Johnson as Labour and other opposition MPs defeated his second attempt to get a general election before 31 October. There cannot now be an election until mid-November at the earliest. MPs also passed a \u201chumble address\u201d ordering Johnson to publish documents detailing the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit plans \u2013 as well as any messages about the suspension of parliament sent by his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, and other aides. On Monday afternoon parliament\u2019s bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit received royal assent and passed into law \u2013 Johnson has insisted, though, that he will not ask for another delay.</p> \n<p>In a further setback for No 10, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october\">Bercow has announced he will stand down on 31 October</a> if there is no election before then. This means his immediate successor is likely to be chosen by the current parliament, in which there is no majority for a no-deal Brexit. It also confirms Bercow will still be in post during the crucial fortnight when parliament returns from prorogation in mid-October. The Liberal Democrats have announced they are set to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/liberal-democrats-poised-to-back-revoking-article-50-brexit\">officially back revoking article 50</a> in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party, effectively severing the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Addiction warning over medications \u2013 </strong>Britain is being warned it is risking a US-style opioid crisis through the widespread prescribing of opioid painkillers, benzodiazepines and sleeping pills. Nearly 12 million people \u2013 about one in four adults in England \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/10/addictive-medication-nhs-opioid-crisis-government-study-england\">taking medicines that they can find hard to stop</a>, according to a review by Public Health England. \u201cWhile the scale and nature of opioid prescribing does not reflect the so-called crisis in North America, the NHS needs to take action now to protect patients,\u201d said Rosanna O\u2019Connor, one of the report\u2019s authors. GPs should instead consider social prescribing, from talking therapies to joining a choir, says the report, while conceding that long-term use of certain classes of drugs like antidepressants is necessary for some.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Creggan flares up \u2013 </strong>Police were attacked with petrol bombs and missiles in Derry\u2019s Creggan estate last night as they carried out searches targeting dissident republicans, the PSNI said. It is the same place where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/10/northern-ireland-petrol-bombs-thrown-at-police-in-creggan-derry\">the journalist Lyra McKee, 29, was murdered</a> by the New IRA in April while she observed riots. The searches were launched after a dissident republican mortar bomb was recovered in Strabane, Co Tyrone, on Saturday. It was positioned close to a family home and aimed at the town\u2019s police station, and represents the seventh attempted murder bid against the security forces in Northern Ireland this year.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Climate apartheid\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The world is in a \u201cgravely insufficient\u201d state of readiness for the inevitable severe effects of global heating, according to a report by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA), which is convened by 18 nations including the UK. Trillion-dollar investment is needed to avert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/10/climate-crisis-world-readiness-effects-gravely-insufficient-report\">\u201cclimate apartheid\u201d, where the rich escape the effects</a> and the poor do not. But this investment is far smaller than the eventual costs and \u201cirrefutable toll on human life\u201d of doing nothing. Separately the National Farmers\u2019 Union is arguing there is no need to cut back beef production or return farmland to forest for the sake of the climate \u2013 instead, UK agricultural emissions could be offset <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/10/no-need-to-cut-beef-to-tackle-climate-crisis-say-farmers\">by growing fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide</a>. Social policy group the RSA welcomed the NFU\u2019s \u201cambitious targets\u201d but Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said eating less but better meat was a crucial part of the fight against climate breakdown.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Life is just too short\u2019 \u2013 </strong>An NHS trust boss has quit her post blaming underfunding of the service and the pressures of the job, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/09/nhs-trust-boss-quits-resignation-letter-life-too-short\">concluding: \u201cLife is just too short.\u201d</a> Siobhan McArdle announced her resignation as chief executive of the South Tees Hospitals Foundation Trust which runs the James Cook hospital in Middlesbrough, Friarage hospital in Northallerton, and community hospitals in North Yorkshire and the Tees Valley. McArdle said the trust had delivered \u00a3140m in efficiency savings over the last five years and could not tighten its belt any more. Saffron Cordery, CEO of NHS Providers which represents trusts, said: \u201cIn recent years trust leaders have become accustomed to demands for productivity improvements and savings that are increasingly unachievable.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>The tale continues \u2013 </strong>Hundreds of fans have lined up to attend the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/10/shes-a-prophet-handmaids-gather-for-margaret-atwoods-midnight-launch-of-the-testaments\">midnight launch of The Testaments</a>, Margaret Atwood\u2019s much-anticipated sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, attended by the Canadian author herself at Waterstone\u2019s in London\u2019s Piccadilly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bb5285e9d127ff0641ec5be3047ff0ae81477e0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bb5285e9d127ff0641ec5be3047ff0ae81477e0/0_100_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Atwood at the launch of The Testaments.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Atwood at the launch of The Testaments.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Siri, sex and Apple\u2019s privacy problem</h2> \n<p>As Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone, Alex Hern explores the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2019/sep/10/siri-sex-and-apples-privacy-problem\">privacy scandal around its automated personal assistant, Siri</a>.

There have been extraordinary scenes of rancour and defiance accompanied by cries of \u201cShame\u201d in the House of Commons overnight as the prorogation of parliament until 14 October went ahead. The Speaker, John Bercow, condemned it as an \u201cact of executive fiat\u201d. Opposition MPs tried to physically stop Bercow from leaving his chair to go out to the House of Lords for the prorogation formalities. Labour and opposition MPs remained in the chamber as the Speaker and Conservative MPs left to go to the House of Lords.

The Mail has \u201cAt last action to beat pills crisis\u201d, but goes hard on the retiring Speaker in a smaller headline: \u201cEnd of the Bercow Show, the partisan pipsqueak who disgraced his office\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Like many struggling actors, in her early 20s Constance Wu waited tables and toyed with the idea of getting a proper job. In her case, retraining to be a speech therapist. Wu is visibly embarrassed when I bring it up, which has less to do with her chosen field, and more with her motivation behind it. \u201cIt\u2019s really the most pathetic reason of all,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI had a boyfriend I was in love with, who wasn\u2019t too psyched with the idea of being with an actress, because it wasn\u2019t stable. He wasn\u2019t like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be with an actress,\u2019 but he said: \u2018I just want a partner with a stable job.\u2019 I tried it. It didn\u2019t work for me. And that relationship did not end up working out.\u201d</p> <p>This was in the early 00s, when Wu was living in New York. By 2010, she had relocated to Los Angeles, where her acting career finally took off with a starring role in the Asian-American sitcom Fresh Off the Boat and a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in last year\u2019s hit<strong> </strong>romcom, Crazy Rich Asians.</p> <p>She started out in community theatre in her home town of Richmond, Virginia, at the age of 12, before training at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute four years later. \u201cThere was no other choice for me in terms of career,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really sensitive, and in an office culture \u2013 especially one that is often dominated by the patriarchy \u2013 sometimes that does not inspire respect or confidence. I\u2019ve found a profession in which I can use those parts of me rather than being ashamed of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45319570892f7b41e786c07c404e0d9fa3d4f423\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45319570892f7b41e786c07c404e0d9fa3d4f423/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wu as Rachel Chu in Crazy Rich Asians.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wu as Rachel Chu in Crazy Rich Asians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI love what I do. It\u2019s more fun for me than going to a party,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I have a day off, I go to acting class. I\u2019m there with all the other actors who are struggling and waiting tables and trying to become actors, just because it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s where I feel most free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSensitive\u201d is not the impression Wu, 37, gave people earlier this year when she found herself at the centre of a social media storm. On the same day that Fresh Off the Boat \u2013 in which Wu plays the tiger mother-of-three, Jessica Huang \u2013 was renewed for a sixth season, Wu tweeted: \u201cSo upset right now that I\u2019m literally crying. Ugh. Fuck.\u201d She followed it up with a second tweet: \u201cFucking hell.\u201d And then she commented: \u201cDislike\u201d on the show\u2019s official Instagram.</p> <p>Her defence \u2013 that she was upset, not because of the renewal, but because it would force her to miss out on another project \u201cthat would have challenged me as an artist\u201d more than the \u201cfun and easy and pleasant\u201d Fresh Off the Boat \u2013 only made things worse. Wu\u2019s apology was slated on social media and in opinion pieces and podcasts that even accused her of clumsily referencing the #MeToo movement when she signed off with: \u201cIt\u2019s meaningful when you make the choice to believe women.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Wu makes another attempt to set the record straight. \u201cI don\u2019t regret being messy and imperfect in public,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I do regret not taking into account how it might have affected people I care about, like the kids on the show. I love them. I had a talk with each kid. I wanted to make sure they knew I acted out of a moment of passion that was not reflective of how I feel about them.\u201dWhen we meet she is in the middle of filming the sixth season, and the cast and crew \u201ccould not be more lovely and supportive,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019m sorry you went through that, and that people think that, but we know who you are.\u2019 Because here\u2019s the thing - we\u2019ve had the same crew for six years. That never happens if you have a diva on set.\u201d</p> <p>Is Wu wary of social media now? \u201cA bit, but I was never really that much of a social media person anyway. I\u2019m definitely not an influencer, and I\u2019m definitely not seeking more followers or anything like that. I\u2019m not a perfect person and I not only think it\u2019s OK, but I think it\u2019s good to sometimes publicly fail.\u201d</p> <p>For someone who describes herself as sensitive, she has an admirable tolerance for haters. \u201cA lot of the time somebody\u2019s mad because they\u2019re hurt,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think you just have to understand that. I don\u2019t want people to get mad but I want people to express their emotions even if they are negative towards me. Expression is just one step towards the larger journey of understanding yourself. Even me, tweeting that in a moment of heat. That\u2019s one step in the larger journey of understanding myself. Human beings are lucky we have the capacity to have emotions. We\u2019re not just eating-and-sleeping machines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eaf4dcf55d24ab8cee70fbc2534da808a5f44ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eaf4dcf55d24ab8cee70fbc2534da808a5f44ef/0_0_3600_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STXfilms</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wu\u2019s latest role is the lead in Hustlers, a comedy-drama inspired by a <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2015/12/robin-hood-strippers-scores-c-v-r.html\" title=\"\">2015 article in New York magazine, The Hustlers at Scores by Jessica Pressler</a>. Part social-commentary, part-heist, the film, co-starring Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B and Lizzo, follows a group of savvy strip-club employees who turn the tables on their Wall Street clients after the 2008 economic collapse.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are like: \u2018What made you want to play a stripper?\u2019 and I\u2019m like: \u2018I didn\u2019t play a stripper; I played a person who works in a strip club for a living,\u2019\u201d says Wu. \u201cI make that distinction because I think people\u2019s occupations are used as identity markers and that leads to a lot of preconceived notions and prejudices. I love that Lorene Scafaria [the director] wasn\u2019t judging these women or thinking that they are their occupations.\u201d</p> <p>What else drew her to the film? \u201cAt the time I was really looking for a movie that was about loneliness, because I think with all the political polarisation that\u2019s going on and the increased amount of time people are spending in front of screens, loneliness ha become pervasive.</p> <p>\u201cIt was everything I was looking for in a project. But not the stripping part. That wasn\u2019t a part of my decision. I don\u2019t really think of myself with a sexual lens. I think of myself as, like, an artist. Not to say some of these girls aren\u2019t artists, but they are exploiting the culture\u2019s obsession with sexuality. I\u2019ve never really thought of that as something I was good at. On a practical level, I\u2019m definitely not good at dancing. I am great at dancing at weddings, but dancing in a sensual manner is something \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>That makes you cringe? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me cringe; it\u2019s just something I\u2019m not skilled in and it makes me self-conscious. But my character, Destiny, isn\u2019t supposed to be as good at it. Jen\u2019s character, Ramona, teaches me. Destiny is a girl who is lonely, and looking for a friend and mentor and she finds it in Ramona.\u201d</p> <p>The two women\u2019s friendship is key to the plot, so I wonder what Wu\u2019s relationship was like with Lopez. \u201cMe and Jen,\u201d she smiles wistfully. \u201cI mean, it was the most peaceful set I\u2019ve ever been on. Jen is such a big star that it was amazing to see what a down-to-earth kind of person she was. She\u2019s really cool.\u201d</p> <p>I ask the question because it was widely reported that Wu had requested top billing above Lopez.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t demanding anything,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cThe reason that happened was because people on the team were calling journalists because they were not putting me in [their stories about the film]. It wasn\u2019t anything I asked them to do.\u201d</p> <p>So it was just another example of the media pitting women against one another? \u201cPeople stereotyping us separates us, and when we are not unified it helps the patriarchy stay in power, right? If you\u2019re at a board meeting and there\u2019s only one seat for a woman and all the other seats are for men, it\u2019s not about being a woman - if you think there\u2019s only one seat, it\u2019s going to be competitive. If it\u2019s a board meeting of all women and there\u2019s only one seat for a man, the men will start becoming competitive. It\u2019s about the scarcity, not gender.</p> <p>\u201cThat was what was really special about Hustlers. Nobody was fighting about the one seat at the table. It was our table. The men in the movie barely have names. It wasn\u2019t written to be their story and that happens to women all the time, where there are no female characters of substance. I really think that is why patriarchy tries to separate us because they know that when we\u2019re together there is nothing more strong and beautiful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f0e8282f83726a89c505cc00cc42a470551660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f0e8282f83726a89c505cc00cc42a470551660/0_368_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wu in Fresh Off The Boat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wu in Fresh Off The Boat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fierce Baby Prods/Detective Agency/20th Century Fox/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next up, Wu is slated to produce and star in an adaptation of Rachel Khong\u2019s<strong> </strong>2017 novel Goodbye, Vitamin. There are also two Crazy Rich Asians sequels in the pipeline, although Wu is vague about details. \u201cI\u2019m still friends with Jon M Chu [the director]. Last I talked to him, they were still working on the scripts.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after we speak, however, the news breaks that Adele Lim, the original film\u2019s Chinese-Malaysian scriptwriter, has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/crazy-rich-asians-sequel-adele-lim-writer-quits-pay-gap-peter-chiarelli-a9092476.html\" title=\"\">walked away from the franchise</a>, claiming that she had been offered much less money than a white male counterpart.</p> <p>Has Crazy Rich Asians improved on-screen diversity? \u201cI think it\u2019s really helped it. It\u2019s exciting to see so many stories by and about Asian-American people,\u201d Wu nods. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the kind of change that\u2019s been happening.\u201d</p> <p>But haven\u2019t there been claims that the film was only a springboard for the cast \u2013 who include Gemma Chan, Awkwafina and Henry Golding \u2013 rather than the wider Asian acting community? \u201cAs an actor it\u2019s hard, no matter what, to get your foot in the door,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were times when I was a younger actor and I\u2019d see a part and think: \u2018Oh, I could have played that,\u2019 but they wouldn\u2019t even let me audition because there were too many people. I understand the frustration, and I think the solution is creating more projects so there are more opportunities to get a foot in the door.\u201d</p> <p>Does Wu feel she has to be an example for the Asian community? \u201cThe fact that I was able to play humanised Asian-American characters was historic, not because of me, but because of the paucity of content that was before. That\u2019s a statement on the system, not on me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat should have been happening all along. Now that I do have amplification, I try to make the best use of it, I want to do it well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky to have a lot of autonomy over my career,\u201d she continues. \u201cI was a waitress for 10 years and I didn\u2019t have a lot of choice. Right now I\u2019m in a space in my career \u2013 which I might not always be in \u2013 where I have a lot of artistic privilege, so I would like to select roles that push and challenge me. That\u2019s not for everybody. Some people have this privilege and make choices that make them, like, an icon. But that\u2019s not what I want to be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be an icon,\u201d she says, checking herself. \u201cIt\u2019s just that [it] was never really on my list of goals.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking of which, what did her parents \u2013 a science professor and a computer programmer \u2013 say when she told them she wanted to act? \u201cWell, I never told them,\u201d Wu says. \u201cIt just sort of happened. I didn\u2019t ask permission. I just assumed.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of parents don\u2019t think it\u2019s a proper job and worry it\u2019s not a stable profession, I say.

      "bodyText": "Like many struggling actors, in her early 20s Constance Wu waited tables and toyed with the idea of getting a proper job. In her case, retraining to be a speech therapist. Wu is visibly embarrassed when I bring it up, which has less to do with her chosen field, and more with her motivation behind it. \u201cIt\u2019s really the most pathetic reason of all,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI had a boyfriend I was in love with, who wasn\u2019t too psyched with the idea of being with an actress, because it wasn\u2019t stable. He wasn\u2019t like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be with an actress,\u2019 but he said: \u2018I just want a partner with a stable job.\u2019 I tried it. It didn\u2019t work for me. And that relationship did not end up working out.\u201d This was in the early 00s, when Wu was living in New York. By 2010, she had relocated to Los Angeles, where her acting career finally took off with a starring role in the Asian-American sitcom Fresh Off the Boat and a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in last year\u2019s hit romcom, Crazy Rich Asians. She started out in community theatre in her home town of Richmond, Virginia, at the age of 12, before training at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute four years later. \u201cThere was no other choice for me in terms of career,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really sensitive, and in an office culture \u2013 especially one that is often dominated by the patriarchy \u2013 sometimes that does not inspire respect or confidence. I\u2019ve found a profession in which I can use those parts of me rather than being ashamed of them. \u201cI love what I do. It\u2019s more fun for me than going to a party,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I have a day off, I go to acting class. I\u2019m there with all the other actors who are struggling and waiting tables and trying to become actors, just because it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s where I feel most free.\u201d \u201cSensitive\u201d is not the impression Wu, 37, gave people earlier this year when she found herself at the centre of a social media storm. On the same day that Fresh Off the Boat \u2013 in which Wu plays the tiger mother-of-three, Jessica Huang \u2013 was renewed for a sixth season, Wu tweeted: \u201cSo upset right now that I\u2019m literally crying. Ugh. Fuck.\u201d She followed it up with a second tweet: \u201cFucking hell.\u201d And then she commented: \u201cDislike\u201d on the show\u2019s official Instagram. Her defence \u2013 that she was upset, not because of the renewal, but because it would force her to miss out on another project \u201cthat would have challenged me as an artist\u201d more than the \u201cfun and easy and pleasant\u201d Fresh Off the Boat \u2013 only made things worse. Wu\u2019s apology was slated on social media and in opinion pieces and podcasts that even accused her of clumsily referencing the #MeToo movement when she signed off with: \u201cIt\u2019s meaningful when you make the choice to believe women.\u201d Today, Wu makes another attempt to set the record straight. \u201cI don\u2019t regret being messy and imperfect in public,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I do regret not taking into account how it might have affected people I care about, like the kids on the show. I love them. I had a talk with each kid. I wanted to make sure they knew I acted out of a moment of passion that was not reflective of how I feel about them.\u201dWhen we meet she is in the middle of filming the sixth season, and the cast and crew \u201ccould not be more lovely and supportive,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019m sorry you went through that, and that people think that, but we know who you are.\u2019 Because here\u2019s the thing - we\u2019ve had the same crew for six years. That never happens if you have a diva on set.\u201d Is Wu wary of social media now? \u201cA bit, but I was never really that much of a social media person anyway. I\u2019m definitely not an influencer, and I\u2019m definitely not seeking more followers or anything like that. I\u2019m not a perfect person and I not only think it\u2019s OK, but I think it\u2019s good to sometimes publicly fail.\u201d For someone who describes herself as sensitive, she has an admirable tolerance for haters. \u201cA lot of the time somebody\u2019s mad because they\u2019re hurt,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think you just have to understand that. I don\u2019t want people to get mad but I want people to express their emotions even if they are negative towards me. Expression is just one step towards the larger journey of understanding yourself. Even me, tweeting that in a moment of heat. That\u2019s one step in the larger journey of understanding myself. Human beings are lucky we have the capacity to have emotions. We\u2019re not just eating-and-sleeping machines.\u201d Wu\u2019s latest role is the lead in Hustlers, a comedy-drama inspired by a 2015 article in New York magazine, The Hustlers at Scores by Jessica Pressler. Part social-commentary, part-heist, the film, co-starring Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B and Lizzo, follows a group of savvy strip-club employees who turn the tables on their Wall Street clients after the 2008 economic collapse. \u201cPeople are like: \u2018What made you want to play a stripper?\u2019 and I\u2019m like: \u2018I didn\u2019t play a stripper; I played a person who works in a strip club for a living,\u2019\u201d says Wu. \u201cI make that distinction because I think people\u2019s occupations are used as identity markers and that leads to a lot of preconceived notions and prejudices. I love that Lorene Scafaria [the director] wasn\u2019t judging these women or thinking that they are their occupations.\u201d What else drew her to the film? \u201cAt the time I was really looking for a movie that was about loneliness, because I think with all the political polarisation that\u2019s going on and the increased amount of time people are spending in front of screens, loneliness ha become pervasive. \u201cIt was everything I was looking for in a project. But not the stripping part. That wasn\u2019t a part of my decision. I don\u2019t really think of myself with a sexual lens. I think of myself as, like, an artist. Not to say some of these girls aren\u2019t artists, but they are exploiting the culture\u2019s obsession with sexuality. I\u2019ve never really thought of that as something I was good at. On a practical level, I\u2019m definitely not good at dancing. I am great at dancing at weddings, but dancing in a sensual manner is something \u2026 \u201d That makes you cringe? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me cringe; it\u2019s just something I\u2019m not skilled in and it makes me self-conscious. But my character, Destiny, isn\u2019t supposed to be as good at it. Jen\u2019s character, Ramona, teaches me. Destiny is a girl who is lonely, and looking for a friend and mentor and she finds it in Ramona.\u201d The two women\u2019s friendship is key to the plot, so I wonder what Wu\u2019s relationship was like with Lopez. \u201cMe and Jen,\u201d she smiles wistfully. \u201cI mean, it was the most peaceful set I\u2019ve ever been on. Jen is such a big star that it was amazing to see what a down-to-earth kind of person she was. She\u2019s really cool.\u201d I ask the question because it was widely reported that Wu had requested top billing above Lopez. \u201cI wasn\u2019t demanding anything,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cThe reason that happened was because people on the team were calling journalists because they were not putting me in [their stories about the film]. It wasn\u2019t anything I asked them to do.\u201d So it was just another example of the media pitting women against one another? \u201cPeople stereotyping us separates us, and when we are not unified it helps the patriarchy stay in power, right? If you\u2019re at a board meeting and there\u2019s only one seat for a woman and all the other seats are for men, it\u2019s not about being a woman - if you think there\u2019s only one seat, it\u2019s going to be competitive. If it\u2019s a board meeting of all women and there\u2019s only one seat for a man, the men will start becoming competitive. It\u2019s about the scarcity, not gender. \u201cThat was what was really special about Hustlers. Nobody was fighting about the one seat at the table. It was our table. The men in the movie barely have names. It wasn\u2019t written to be their story and that happens to women all the time, where there are no female characters of substance. I really think that is why patriarchy tries to separate us because they know that when we\u2019re together there is nothing more strong and beautiful.\u201d Next up, Wu is slated to produce and star in an adaptation of Rachel Khong\u2019s 2017 novel Goodbye, Vitamin. There are also two Crazy Rich Asians sequels in the pipeline, although Wu is vague about details. \u201cI\u2019m still friends with Jon M Chu [the director]. Last I talked to him, they were still working on the scripts.\u201d Shortly after we speak, however, the news breaks that Adele Lim, the original film\u2019s Chinese-Malaysian scriptwriter, has walked away from the franchise, claiming that she had been offered much less money than a white male counterpart. Has Crazy Rich Asians improved on-screen diversity? \u201cI think it\u2019s really helped it. It\u2019s exciting to see so many stories by and about Asian-American people,\u201d Wu nods. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the kind of change that\u2019s been happening.\u201d But haven\u2019t there been claims that the film was only a springboard for the cast \u2013 who include Gemma Chan, Awkwafina and Henry Golding \u2013 rather than the wider Asian acting community? \u201cAs an actor it\u2019s hard, no matter what, to get your foot in the door,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were times when I was a younger actor and I\u2019d see a part and think: \u2018Oh, I could have played that,\u2019 but they wouldn\u2019t even let me audition because there were too many people. I understand the frustration, and I think the solution is creating more projects so there are more opportunities to get a foot in the door.\u201d Does Wu feel she has to be an example for the Asian community? \u201cThe fact that I was able to play humanised Asian-American characters was historic, not because of me, but because of the paucity of content that was before. That\u2019s a statement on the system, not on me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat should have been happening all along. Now that I do have amplification, I try to make the best use of it, I want to do it well.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have a lot of autonomy over my career,\u201d she continues. \u201cI was a waitress for 10 years and I didn\u2019t have a lot of choice. Right now I\u2019m in a space in my career \u2013 which I might not always be in \u2013 where I have a lot of artistic privilege, so I would like to select roles that push and challenge me. That\u2019s not for everybody. Some people have this privilege and make choices that make them, like, an icon. But that\u2019s not what I want to be. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be an icon,\u201d she says, checking herself. \u201cIt\u2019s just that [it] was never really on my list of goals.\u201d Speaking of which, what did her parents \u2013 a science professor and a computer programmer \u2013 say when she told them she wanted to act? \u201cWell, I never told them,\u201d Wu says. \u201cIt just sort of happened. I didn\u2019t ask permission. I just assumed.\u201d A lot of parents don\u2019t think it\u2019s a proper job and worry it\u2019s not a stable profession, I say. You know \u2013 like your ex. \u201cBut when you\u2019re 18, you don\u2019t have to listen to your parents, so I\u2019d hear them in their worry and I\u2019d understand it was motivated by love, but I also knew myself better than my parents. Nobody knows you better than yourself.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re an artist, you have to do something for a deeper purpose than seeking approval [or] it\u2019s going to be a real rough time for you. You need a stronger core of meaning than that. Seeking whose approval? Seek your own artistic approval. That\u2019s your metric.\u201d Hustlers is out on 13 September.",

Doing so would free up much more land for trees and agroforestry, which would absorb huge quantities of carbon from the atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems the NFU is still not prepared to contemplate significant land use change in Britain, despite the CCC recommending this as being vital,\u201d he said, noting that some progressive farmers are starting to pioneer a new approach to managing the land.</p> <p>Some environmental groups have called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/21/rewild-quarter-uk-fight-climate-crisis-campaigners-urge\">quarter of the UK to be returned to nature through rewilding</a> to tackle the climate crisis and the loss of wildlife. Batters said: \u201cAll farms have wild areas on them. It shouldn\u2019t be a binary debate of rewilding versus production.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers are extremely worried about a possible no-deal Brexit and the UK being flooded with cheap, lower-standard food, and Batters said achieving climate neutrality would be extremely hard in that scenario.</p> <p>The NFU report does not assess whether payments to farms \u2013 currently \u00a33bn a year under the EU subsidy regime \u2013 would need to rise or fall in order to make agriculture climate neutral. Batters said it was vital for the government to introduce the right policies so farmers were given incentives to deal with emissions, and have long-term funding in place.</p>",

Its plans highlight feed additives to cut methane in animals, gene editing to improve crops and livestock, and controlled-release fertilisers. \u201cIt is very welcome that the NFU is setting ambitious targets,\u201d said Sue Pritchard, the director of the RSA\u2019s food, farming and countryside commission, which concluded in July that farming must be radically transformed within 10 years to end environmental destruction. \u201cMany farmers are already doing what they can \u2013 the growth of the pasture fed livestock movement is a case in point.\u201d The Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: \u201cEating less but better meat is a crucial part of the fight against climate breakdown, yet astonishingly there is no mention of this in the NFU\u2019s report. Doing so would free up much more land for trees and agroforestry, which would absorb huge quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. \u201cIt seems the NFU is still not prepared to contemplate significant land use change in Britain, despite the CCC recommending this as being vital,\u201d he said, noting that some progressive farmers are starting to pioneer a new approach to managing the land. Some environmental groups have called for a quarter of the UK to be returned to nature through rewilding to tackle the climate crisis and the loss of wildlife. Batters said: \u201cAll farms have wild areas on them. It shouldn\u2019t be a binary debate of rewilding versus production.\u201d Farmers are extremely worried about a possible no-deal Brexit and the UK being flooded with cheap, lower-standard food, and Batters said achieving climate neutrality would be extremely hard in that scenario. The NFU report does not assess whether payments to farms \u2013 currently \u00a33bn a year under the EU subsidy regime \u2013 would need to rise or fall in order to make agriculture climate neutral. Batters said it was vital for the government to introduce the right policies so farmers were given incentives to deal with emissions, and have long-term funding in place.",

A clinic called to let me know that a counselor had an unexpected opening. I just needed to hold on for another week for my first appointment.</p> <p>The morning of my first session, I was terrified. In fact, I almost ran out of the clinic before I was finally called back to a cozy office.</p> <p>The counselor introduced herself and started explaining her background and doctor-patient confidentiality while I scratched at a red spot on my thumb, already rubbed raw from a nervous tic I\u2019ve had since I was a kid. I had no idea where to begin, but fortunately I didn\u2019t need to. The counselor had prepared questions and answering them proved comforting \u2013 even though it meant divulging things I\u2019d never shared with anyone before. We scheduled weekly sessions, something to hold on to.</p> <p>I saw signs of improvement over the next couple of weeks \u2013 small, silly things to anyone not living in my head. Checking the mail is hardly herculean, but I had avoided my mailbox for two months fearing the bills inside.</p> <p>Just as things were looking up again, tragedy struck. My dad and stepmom had come to visit me the last weekend in January, an extremely rare treat. We\u2019d had a good time as I showed them my apartment, my new office, and some of my favorite restaurants. They were worried \u2013 I\u2019d let slip on social media that I was having panic attacks \u2013 but I deftly deflected any conversations that touched on my mental health.</p> <p>We parted ways in the early afternoon. As they started the 200-mile drive back to Dallas, I hiked in the woods. About an hour later, still on the road, they tried to call me and I knew something must be wrong, especially since my mother, who was living in Nebraska, tried to call shortly afterward.</p> <p>I found a clearing in the forest with phone service and called my mom. It turned out that my 45-year-old sister, Molly, was in a coma in a Montana hospital, and no one really knew what was happening.</p> <p>If things were desperate before that call, I don\u2019t know what words would describe the weeks that followed. Grief. Anxiety. Pressure. So much pressure. The dutiful son ripped to shreds from conflicting impulses. Mom all-but-asking me to stay away. Dad all-but-begging me to accompany him to see his daughter one last time.</p> <p>My colleagues were supportive, offering to take over my classes if needed. I knew they were sincere, too, but that only heightened my anxiety. Academic jobs are hard to find and funding for my position wasn\u2019t stable. What would happen if it looked like I was unreliable?</p> <p>Even if I\u2019d been able to overcome that set of fears, the logistics proved too much for me to cope with in my emotional state. When your sister lies close to death 1,500 miles away, what is the best time to show up at her bedside? Is it five days into her coma, when she won\u2019t know you\u2019re there but there are still hopeful signs she might recover? Is it on day 11, when her eyes finally open, but she\u2019s at best only dimly aware of what\u2019s happening? Or would it be more supportive to save my limited vacation days to help with funeral plans if it came to that?</p> <p>Worst of all, I didn\u2019t feel it was right to burden my parents with knowledge of my mental health struggles when they were grieving the impending loss of their daughter.</p> <p>The facades of health and happiness and professional detachment were collapsing in on me. The only way I could see to relieve the pressure was to let the world see my brokenness. In that moment, how the world reacted hardly seemed to matter. So I explained to my students what was happening.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The day before Valentine\u2019s Day, my younger sister passed away.

They left condolence cards in my mailbox and sent emails to let me know they were praying for my family. They stopped by my office to check on me. Up to that point, I\u2019d been so caught up in my despair that it never occurred to me that I might be worthy of concern and support. Being accepted despite my flaws touched me in ways that are hard to express.</p> <p>What happened next, though, transformed me. In their condolences, students shared their own experiences with loss, grief, depression and anxiety \u2013&#xa0;far more than I could have guessed for lives so young.</p> <p>Encouraged by their candor and support, I continued to open up. For instance, when I started antidepressants a few weeks later, I warned students before my lecture that I might be a bit loopy because I was experiencing distracting tingling sensations. I expected students might look at me as though I were crazy. Instead, I saw heads nodding in recognition. Soon, students showed up at office hours to thank me. They had never heard a professor expose that side of themselves. They saw their own struggles reflected in my vulnerability, and they saw something else, too. They saw hope.</p> <p>Our students struggle far more than we can imagine. We\u2019re often unaware of their difficulties, largely because we only see them for a few hours each week, often in large groups. At the same time, students are crafting walls of feigned invulnerability and confidence in emulation of the masks faculty wear. From freshman year to full tenure, academic life is lived under constant scrutiny. Is it any wonder we fear revealing anything that might be perceived as weakness?</p> <p>Since opening up about my mental health, students have given me a peek behind their facades, sharing their stories of grief and despair: the unexpected death of a parent, the suicide of a sibling, paralyzing panic, involuntary commitment to psychiatric hospitals, abusive relationships and more.</p> <p>Importantly, they don\u2019t view me as a counselor. While a few students have asked what to expect if they enter therapy, not one has asked me to help them work through psychological trauma. That\u2019s not my job, nor is it theirs when I describe my own issues \u2013 students understand and respect that.</p> <p>Mostly, I believe they share their stories because they desperately need to be understood by those who are shaping their lives and their careers. Struggling to succeed while grappling with mental health issues is difficult enough. Keeping that struggle secret \u2013 especially from those who evaluate your performance \u2013 is exhausting. A barely passing grade separated from a student\u2019s lived experience seems like a mediocre effort. But in the context of crippling depression and anxiety, it becomes a monumental tribute to their dedication, drive and ability. When that same student earns an \u201cA\u201d, a letter grade hardly seems adequate to reflect the magnitude of their accomplishments.</p> <p>Yes, part of our job as professors is to evaluate students\u2019 performance objectively and honestly, and we do our best to prepare them for the \u201creal world\u201d, which can be unforgiving of mental health struggles. But students already know that life is hard. Far more of them have learned this basic lesson more intimately than anyone would like to acknowledge.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, as teachers we should include in our lessons that it is possible to be successful even when life is hard. Students need to learn from our example, through our own authenticity, that mental illness does not sentence them to failure. Perhaps, above all, they need to learn that all of us deserve a little bit of grace.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This article was supported by the <a href=\"http://economichardship.org/\">Economic Hardship Reporting Project.</a></em></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

      "body": "<p>Shortly before 5pm on 22 February, a suited man with a lapel pin bearing the dimpled face of Kim Jong-un rang the doorbell of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/27/secretive-group-seeking-to-topple-kim-jong-un-says-it-carried-out-north-korea-embassy-raid-spain\" title=\"\">North Korean embassy in Madrid</a>. The man had visited the embassy before. Fifteen days earlier, he had been turned away by an official who was suspicious of his claims that he was a businessman hoping to invest in North Korea. Before he left, the visitor gave the official his card, which said he ran a Dubai-based investment fund named Baron Stone Capital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/27/inside-the-bizarre-bungled-raid-on-north-koreas-madrid-embassy-podcast\">Inside the bizarre, bungled raid on North Korea's Madrid embassy \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the visitor had returned, claiming he had a gift for the embassy\u2019s senior official, So Yun-sok. This time, he was ushered inside and asked to wait in the courtyard between the compound\u2019s main two-storey building and its solid metal outer gate. While the official went to look for Mr So, the visitor walked to the perimeter of the compound and surreptitiously released the lock on the outside gate.</p> <p>A few moments later, a group of men carrying combat knives, iron bars, handcuffs and fake pistols burst through the embassy door. According to a 14-page summary of the incident by the Spanish high court judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata, within minutes all four male employees at the embassy had been tied up and bundled into a first-floor meeting room. The assailants, some wearing black balaclavas and others with their faces uncovered, spoke in American English and the distinctive Korean of Seoul and the South.</p> <p>Mr So\u2019s wife, named in Spanish court documents as Jang Ok Gyong, was watching television with their eight-year-old son when she heard what sounded like a struggle in the hallway. She locked the room, but soon the assailants forced their way in, though they insisted they would do her no harm. For the next four hours, she and her son were held captive, watched by a man with a black scarf over his face, a body camera and what seemed like a real gun in a holster. She claims she was so terrified that she secretly grabbed a razor to slit her wrists, but was unable to follow through. Instead, she and her son huddled together under a blanket.</p> <p>In the meeting room, according to testimony from the embassy staff, the assailants placed black hoods over the hostages\u2019 heads, swapped some of the plastic cable ties they had used to secure the hostages for handcuffs, and ordered them to sit in silence. One assailant was allegedly overheard asking another exactly how many people were taking part. \u201cThere are 11 of us,\u201d was the reply. The senior official, So Yun-sok, was then taken down to the basement, where the group finally revealed one of its aims. They wanted him to defect.</p> <p>Diplomatic defections are one of North Korea\u2019s most visible problems, and in recent years there have been two high-profile cases. Just a few months before the embassy raid, in late 2018, the acting ambassador to Italy had abandoned his post and gone into hiding. Two years earlier, the deputy ambassador in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/friends-of-north-korean-defectors-son-speak-of-their-worries\" title=\"\">Thae Yong-ho</a>, became the most senior North Korean official to defect to South Korea.</p> <p>In the basement, the attackers told So Yun-sok they wanted him \u201cto become the ambassador of a new state set up by them \u2013 a \u2018free\u2019 state,\u201d he later told Spanish investigators. The men claimed that \u201cthe North Korean government has very little time left\u201d and said other groups were \u201cgoing to do the same thing\u201d. Yet there were no embassy raids in other countries, and Mr So refused to defect.</p> <p>From this point onwards, the assailants\u2019 plan began to fall apart. Eventually, with Spanish police outside the embassy growing increasingly suspicious, the men decided to make their getaway. They were remarkably successful. More than six months later, only one of the group allegedly involved in the raid has been detained \u2013 a 38-year-old former US marine sergeant, Christopher Ahn. A global manhunt is under way for up to 10 more assailants.</p> <p>After the attackers fled, in the days and weeks that followed, details about their identities and aims started to trickle out, leaving as many questions as answers. The group seemed to be largely comprised of Korean Americans, South Koreans and North Korean defectors. But who were they? What did they want? Why did they fly across the world to attack an embassy in Europe? And what was the significance of the fact that one alleged member of the group turned out to have impressive connections within Washington?</p> <p>Alongside the obvious strangeness of the raid itself, Korea-watchers were struck by the timing. A few days later, Donald Trump was due to meet Kim for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/feb/27/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-summit-vietnam-north-korea-hanoi-live\" title=\"\">a summit in Hanoi</a> to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Was that why this mysterious group raided the embassy? Spanish investigators remain puzzled, but Mario Esteban, a Korea expert at Madrid\u2019s Elcano thinktank, believes it was an attempt to disrupt Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim. \u201cIt was a very risky thing to do, in a friendly country, just before Hanoi \u2013 and messy,\u201d he told me. \u201cNothing else makes sense.\u201d That, however, is not what the attackers say.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Three days after the attack, an obscure dissident group called Free Joseon, or Free North Korea, claimed responsibility, and later announced they were forming a rebel government-in-exile. \u201cWe hereby take into our own hands our destiny and duty,\u201d the group declared. Prior to the Madrid attack, only the most eager Korea-watchers had heard of this group, and observers are still piecing together clues about the group\u2019s members and backers. \u201cIt\u2019s a radical group of people you can call zealots, heroes or fanatics, depending on your point of view,\u201d Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, a leading expert on North Korea, told me by phone from Seoul.</p> <p>There are two opposing versions of events inside the embassy, neither of them fully reliable. One comes from Free Joseon\u2019s website, which strongly denies that violence was used. Its official line is that the group were responding to a request from embassy officials, who had contacted Free Joseon for help in defecting.</p> <p>The second version comes from the hostages, who included the wives of two officials and an eight-year-old child. As servants of Kim\u2019s murderous and paranoid regime, they must be careful not to upset their leader or his enforcers. Yet Spanish investigators found enough evidence in witness statements, police evidence and an embassy search to issue arrest warrants for \u201crobbery with violence and intimidation\u201d, \u201cillegal restraint\u201d, \u201cthreats\u201d, \u201ccausing injuries\u201d and membership of a criminal gang. The embassy officials described an experience similar to that of US army captives in Iraq, where Ahn\u2019s battalion once ran a Fallujah detention centre. (Sources close to Ahn told me he was not the only military veteran involved in the raid, but refused to specify which country\u2019s armed services the others had served in.)</p> <p>The rights and wrongs of the case should eventually be decided at a trial in Madrid \u2013 that is, if the suspects can be located, the US agrees to Spain\u2019s request for American suspects to be extradited, and North Korea allows its embassy staff to be cross-examined. In the meantime, court and police documents originating from Spain, Italy and the US point to three key, US-based players.</p> <p>First, there is the group\u2019s alleged leader: Adrian Hong. <a href=\"https://es.scribd.com/document/408109231/Adrian-Hon\" title=\"\">A wanted poster</a>, released by US marshals, says Hong uses at least two aliases, is \u201cconsidered to be armed and dangerous\u201d and had been seen driving around Los Angeles in a large white Kia Soul SUV with a licence plate that read \u201cArdent\u201d. It was Hong who posed as an investor when he first approached the embassy in early February. In reality, Hong is a Los Angeles-based, Yale-educated Mexican-Korean, with a long history of peaceful activism on issues relating to North Korea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30102219a5e11e693f84688cacbf566cc101a67a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30102219a5e11e693f84688cacbf566cc101a67a/4_24_695_697/499.jpg\" alt=\"A wanted poster for Adrian Hong released by the US Department of Justice.\" width=\"499\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wanted poster for Adrian Hong released by the US Department of Justice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US marshals</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>News of Hong\u2019s alleged involvement in the raid astonished many who knew him. \u201cYou could have knocked me over with a gnat\u2019s wing,\u201d wrote Joshua Stanton, a Washington lawyer and author of the long-running Free Korea blog. Yet Spanish \u201cgovernment sources\u201d told the newspaper El Pa\u00eds that the country\u2019s intelligence services had proof that Hong and at least one other group member had been in contact with the CIA. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have said that if they weren\u2019t sure,\u201d claimed Esteban. (The state department has denied any US involvement.)</p> <p>The apparent second-in-command was Samuel Ryu, a 28-year-old American who had allegedly been preparing the raid for months, but who remains a mystery. Then, there is Ahn, the former US marine sergeant, who was arrested in Los Angeles on 18 April and is fighting extradition to Spain. Ahn has not denied being present, but his lawyers claimed in court that the embassy takeover was peaceful.</p> <p>Although the Madrid raid seems like a curious sideshow, it is worth recalling the stakes being played for in North Korea. These include nuclear warheads, chemical weapons, a brutal regime that murders and tortures, seven decades of armed standoff and tens of millions of Koreans potentially exposed to the deadly fallout should the Korean war ever start again. Many observers believe Trump is so keen to burnish his reputation by striking a historic deal with North Korea that he is making dangerous and foolish concessions to Pyongyang, without doing anything meaningful to reduce the nuclear threat that Kim\u2019s regime poses. If Free Joseon\u2019s aim really was to disrupt the Hanoi summit in February, they were not the only ones who were looking ahead to that meeting with concern. \u201cPeople were afraid that Trump would basically sign everything to North Korea,\u201d explains Lankov, who was in Washington at the time. \u201cThat was not just [a view held by] conspiracy theorists, but amongst very serious people.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On a sweltering July afternoon in Madrid, I called the North Korean official, So Yun-sok, to ask him about the raid. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about that,\u201d was his abrupt reply. In Spain, however, you do not need a diplomat to hear the Kim regime\u2019s official version of events. Instead, you can turn to an eccentric Catalan aristocrat called Alejandro Cao de Ben\u00f3s.</p> <p>Cao de Ben\u00f3s is, for all intents and purposes, head of global PR for North Korea, running an international network of cheerleaders for a country that sits at, or near, the bottom of most global lists for human rights. The 45-year-old Spaniard comes and goes from the Madrid embassy, vets and filters people wishing to visit the country, and ensures visas are issued for selected journalists, investors and tourists. In the past, he ran the Pyongyang Caf\u00e9, a North Korean-themed bar in his home city of Tarragona. For ceremonial occasions Cao de Ben\u00f3s dresses in a uniform festooned with medals, with gold lapel tabs and topped by a peaked officer\u2019s cap with a red band. In conversation, he comes over as a cross between the enthusiastic promoter of an exotic tourist destination and a cold war-style critic of the \u201csatanic\u201d US. He denies that Pyongyang\u2019s notorious regime tortures and executes dissidents. He is, in other words, an extremely unreliable source \u2013 but one with access to at least some inside information.</p> <p>Cao de Ben\u00f3s forwarded me an email he received on 4 February from an \u201cElena S\u00e1nchez\u201d, who claimed to be associate director of Baron Stone Capital. The investment fund had supposedly earmarked up to $50m to invest in \u201cinfrastructure, mining and energy\u201d in North Korea, Mongolia and Myanmar. Its managing director was due in Madrid. Could he visit the embassy? \u201cI started to vet them but the answer, for the moment, was \u2018no\u2019,\u201d Cao de Ben\u00f3s told me. Baron Stone Capital does not appear to be a real company, and it has no presence at the Dubai address where it supposedly had an office.</p> <p>It was three days after the email arrived that Adrian Hong first appeared at the embassy gate. He showed a fake Italian driving licence and, after being refused entry, left behind his Baron Stone business card. The following day, Hong flew from Spain to the Czech capital, Prague, but at least one of his alleged accomplices, Samuel Ryu, remained in Spain, staying at the Eurostars Zarzuela Park hotel, just 300 metres from the embassy. In June 2018, Ryu had lodged there for five nights with five South Koreans aged between 22 and 25, at least three of whom appear to have returned to participate in the embassy raid. It seems plausible that they made that trip to scope out their target.</p> <p>Far from being the bunkered fortress that one might expect, the Madrid embassy is a low, beige and brown building, surrounded by rough land, with rickety- looking security cameras and the sort of low walls that a bored teenager might be tempted to jump. It is an easy, isolated target, sitting on an island of scrubby, undeveloped land in a remote corner of Madrid\u2019s exclusive Moncloa-Aravaca neighbourhood. That, Lankov told me, might help explain why it was chosen for the raid. Apart from three embassy cars, a thief would have found little of value inside. North Korea is poor, and economic sanctions are hitting hard. The cash-strapped embassy housed just one diplomat, his family and three \u201cadministrative staff\u201d (plus one staff member\u2019s wife), who also did the gardening and acted as doormen. In sweltering Madrid, the embassy has a single air-conditioning unit that is wheeled out for visitors. The building\u2019s insurance policy lapsed last year.</p> <p>On 20 February 2019, two days before the raid, Hong returned to Madrid and renewed his passport at the Mexican embassy. By then, most of his team were already in the city and had begun buying equipment for the raid, making two visits to a large hardware store called Ferreteria Delicias. \u201cIt was odd because they were buying the sort of things you need for breaking into somewhere, but they were smart-looking and didn\u2019t seem suspicious,\u201d the store owner, Ram\u00f3n Villar, told me. Among the items they bought were 10 iron crowbars, bolt cutters, a telescopic ladder, pliers and tape.</p> <p>Hong, meanwhile, visited a self-styled \u201cpolice boutique\u201d called Shoke, which attracts self-defence hobbyists and Madrid cops wanting to stock up on everything from extra holsters and handcuffs to badges and boots. He bought four combat knives, five pairs of metal handcuffs, balaclavas, some quick-draw gun holsters and six authentic-looking pistols, which were actually harmless \u201cairsoft\u201d pellet guns. The bill came to \u20ac833.15.</p> <p>It appears that one of the last to join the team was Ahn, who only arrived on a flight from New York at 8am on the morning of the embassy takeover. By midday on 22 February, with Trump due in Hanoi five days later, the team were ready.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If Free Joseon\u2019s first mistake that afternoon was having no real Plan B in the event that So Yun-sok did not defect, their other major blunder was to leave an embassy resident unaccounted for. After the raid began, the wife of one of the administrative workers, named in court documents as Cho Sun Hi, locked herself in an upstairs room. She was terrified. In North Korea, South Koreans and, especially, Americans are painted as violent monsters. \u201cI\u2019d always been taught that it [the US] was the enemy, full of big-nosed, big-eyed, vicious people who\u2019d killed my countrymen,\u201d the defector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/christianity-defectors-escape-route-north-korea\" title=\"\">Joseph Kim</a> writes in his memoir Under the Same Sky.</p> <p>Afraid of what the captors might do, Cho Sun Hi, who is 56, climbed on to a balcony and jumped into the garden, injuring her leg and cutting her head on a stone tile in the process. She then crawled across a paddle tennis court to a back gate, emerging bloodied and dirty on to the street. Seeing her in distress, a passing driver took her a few blocks away to the gates of a private clinic, though she spoke no Spanish and could not explain what was happening. Her wounds were tended to inside an ambulance that was called to the clinic. She only felt safe, she said later, after insisting they call the police. Through a translation app, she was able to explain to the police and ambulance crew that the embassy had been assaulted. It sounded absurd, but a patrol car was dispatched.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a29153450356957e32f9bad6c329eddee550a57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a29153450356957e32f9bad6c329eddee550a57/39_41_3370_1662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Ahn, allegedly shown in pictures taken by a surveillance camera at North Korea\u2019s embassy in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"493\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Ahn, allegedly shown in pictures taken by a surveillance camera at North Korea\u2019s embassy in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When police knocked on the door of the embassy, it was opened by a polite man in a suit, with a Kim Jong-un badge on his lapel. This was Hong. All was well, he told them. Police cannot enter a diplomatic delegation \u2013 which is inviolable and immune from search \u2013 without permission. Just in case, however, they waited nearby.</p> <p>Inside the building, the assailants were beginning to panic. So Yun-sok had refused to defect, and now the police were outside. It was time to go. They took the keys to the three embassy cars and sped out of the compound, leaving behind only Hong and one accomplice. The cars were dumped in Madrid and the neighbouring town of Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n over the ensuing hour, one with its doors open and the motor still running.</p> <p>Back in the embassy, a few minutes earlier, Hong had ordered an Uber using the alias \u201cOswaldo Trump\u201d. Now it was outside, parked in front of the embassy. But the police were there, too, and three North Korean students who had been trying to contact friends inside the embassy were preparing to jump over the garden wall to see what was going on. Instead of leaving in the Uber, Hong cancelled the ride and changed his plan. He and his accomplice went out the back way, through the overgrown plot behind the compound. A second Uber, again ordered by Oswaldo Trump, was waiting for him on a different street.</p> <p>Just as Hong was escaping, the hostages were starting to free themselves. One rubbed his face on a sofa to lift the bag off his head, while Jang Ok Gyong found a knife to cut the remaining plastic cable ties. Within minutes, they spilled on to the street in front of the startled Spanish police officers. At least one man was still wearing handcuffs.</p> <p>The raid had not exactly gone to plan, but it had not been a total failure. While the embassy staff were tied up, the assailants filmed themselves smashing portraits of the Kim family in a separate room. They later sent a video to Fox News. The symbolic potency of this is considerable, Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea expert at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, told me. \u201cIt cracks the taboo that the Kim regime is inviolable and cannot be desecrated,\u201d he says. They also stole So Yun-sok\u2019s mobile phone as well as flash drives, and broke open computers to extract hard drives. All of the men involved managed to get away from the scene of the crime safely. The team fled to Lisbon, a six-hour drive away \u2013 with Spain\u2019s ABC newspaper reporting that Hong took his Uber all the way, paying \u20ac900. On 23 February, accompanied by Ryu and two others, Hong flew from Lisbon to Newark, New Jersey.</p> <p>Then, on 27 February, as Trump was meeting Kim in Hanoi, Hong made a puzzling decision: he contacted the FBI, explaining what he had done and handing over the stolen computer drives. Hong wasn\u2019t detained at that point, since Spain had yet to issue arrest warrants. He was, however, admitting to having committed a serious felony in a friendly country, and when he met FBI agents again in mid-March, he also detailed Ahn\u2019s role. This led to warrants being issued 10 days later and brought Ahn\u2019s arrest (US marshals found him at Hong\u2019s apartment), while Hong himself went on the run and has not been caught.</p> <p>The question is why, after conceiving an elaborate plot, then bungling it, then evading capture, Hong would decide to admit it all to the authorities, only to then disappear again.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Adrian Hong arrived in the US in 1991 as a seven-year-old boy. His father Joseph was a taekwondo champion and Christian missionary who had emigrated from South Korea to Tijuana, Mexico \u2013 where Hong was born, and his father taught martial arts under the nickname \u201cEl Tigre\u201d \u2013 before moving a dozen miles across the border to Chula Vista, San Diego. The family eventually settled into a suburban house backing on to a busy freeway.</p> <p>Hong inherited his father\u2019s missionary zeal. As a 17-year-old Yale freshman, he wrote to the Korea Herald, an English-language newspaper in Seoul, to berate young Koreans and Korean-Americans for lacking \u201cpassion for their nation\u201d while sporting the \u201chorrible-looking haircuts and clothes styles\u201d inspired by early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/k-pop\" title=\"\">K-pop</a>. He described himself as a proud Korean patriot who was \u201cashamed\u201d of his people for their political apathy and loose morals.</p> <p>Determination, charisma and righteous conviction took Hong a long way. In 2004, he helped to host the annual Korean American Students Conference in New Haven, where he co-founded an organisation called Liberation for North Korea, or Link. Link, which later changed its name to Liberty in North Korea, was spectacularly successful. Some four years later, aged just 22, Hong was running an NGO with 100 campus chapters worldwide, an annual income of $143,000 and funding from Washington\u2019s Freedom House thinktank.</p> <p>Link\u2019s co-founder was Paul Kim, a Korean-American comedian known as PK. In April, a couple of months after the embassy raid, Kim received a visit from US marshals on the hunt for Hong, though he didn\u2019t know his old friend\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cHe\u2019s not the bad guy here. He\u2019s one of the smartest guys I know, and also one of the most eloquent writers,\u201d Kim told me on the phone from Los Angeles. Kim also recalled that Hong\u2019s strident activism sometimes failed to impress native Koreans. When American members of Hong\u2019s organisation set up mock funerals in Seoul to highlight the plight of North Korea\u2019s citizens, many locals took offence. \u201cPeople were like: \u2018You don\u2019t live here, you don\u2019t understand. Don\u2019t tell us what to do\u2019,\u201d said Kim.</p> <p>Hong\u2019s grand passion was helping refugees from North Korea. Any North Korean who manages to escape across the border to China faces a difficult path. If Chinese police catch them, they are sent back home, where they risk instant punishment. Most who manage to evade capture are forced to live clandestinely, often in poverty, or end up falling victim to people-traffickers. Link became one of several groups running \u201cunderground railroads\u201d, helping defectors make their way to South Korea or beyond. These still operate today, and Link has rescued more than 1,000 people over the past decade.</p> <p>Hong would sometimes travel to China to assist with Link\u2019s work, displaying the bravery and apparent calmness under pressure that he would later show in Madrid. In some cases, he accompanied young escapees through China personally, buying them fashionable clothes and teaching them to pass as spoiled Korean Americans so that they could travel more freely. \u201cHe was young, his hair was cut in a stylish way, and his clothes were American and very hip. Everything about him, in fact, was cool,\u201d wrote Joseph Kim in Under the Same Sky, after Hong calmly walked him into a US consulate in China. But, just like in Madrid, Hong also had a tendency to overreach and to place exaggerated faith in his own abilities, with disastrous consequences.</p> <p>In December 2006, Hong attempted to force the US consulate in Shenyang, a city in north-eastern China, to admit six North Korean refugees. The plan misfired. His team and the refugees were all arrested, though Hong\u2019s eight days in jail were minor compared to the months of prison suffered by others who have been caught helping refugees over the past decade.</p> <p>Tim Peters of Helping Hands Korea, a Christian NGO, told me that Hong\u2019s rashness in Shenyang had alarmed those who had spent years quietly building escape networks. \u201cIt really sent shock tremors through the whole community,\u201d he said. Although the Shenyang Six were allowed to leave the country eight months later, extra Chinese guards were placed around consulates, making it \u201cless likely than ever\u201d that escapees could seek asylum in the US, noted the journalist Melanie Kirkpatrick in her book Escape from North Korea.</p> <p>After Madrid, Peters worries people will conflate the underground railroad with violent attacks such as the embassy raid. \u201cThat\u2019s political,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we, or others, do.\u201d Link has also distanced itself from Hong, pointing out that it has been more than a decade since he was involved with the group. However, sources at Spain\u2019s National Court confirmed to me that it has also issued a warrant for Cheol (or Charles) Ryu, a 25-year-old US citizen who fled North Korea as a teenager, posts on Instagram as @freshprinceofpyongyang (bio: \u201cjust chillin\u2019 in USA until I can go back to the Hermit Kingdom\u201d) and worked with Link until late last year. \u201cIt appears that he was contacted by Adrian Hong and, unbeknownst to our organisation, recruited to be involved in Free Joseon\u2019s activities after leaving Link,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO, Hannah Song, said in a statement sent to me by Link. Ryu has not responded to my emails or Facebook messages. A fifth warrant has been issued in the name of South Korean Woo Ran Lee, the same sources said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 2008, back when Hong decided to leave Link to devote himself to political advocacy, he wrote a farewell note. \u201cLiberty will come for the North Koreans soon,\u201d he promised. From that time onwards, his movements become harder to piece together. What is certain is that he built contacts in Washington, thinktanks and academia, becoming accepted as a serious advocate for change in Korea. He was involved in several social start-ups and became a TED Fellow in 2009, networking and creating independent conferences about political change in Asia and Africa. In 2011, after Libya\u2019s leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed, Hong organised a conference in the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli, hailing the Arab spring as \u201ca dress rehearsal for North Korea\u201d. Yet the Kim regime stayed stubbornly in place.</p> <p>In Washington and elsewhere, Hong won admirers. He had strong enough connections to secure five visits to the White House between 2011 and 2012, and has photographs with Barack Obama to prove it. \u201cHe is a very suave, charming personality in any social setting \u2013 self-confident, but not arrogant,\u201d said Lee, who invited him to talks to his students at Tufts in 2013 after Hong had set up an NGO consultancy called Pegasus Strategies. How Hong made money during this time remains an unresolved question, though South Korea\u2019s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper has claimed, without offering evidence, that \u201chis consulting work often involved the CIA\u201d. Whatever the case, in retrospect it seems that Hong\u2019s impatience for change was growing.</p> <p>In 2015, Hong created the Joseon Institute. Its mission statement predicted \u201cseismic shifts in the near term\u201d and spoke of preparing administrators for a free North Korea. It boasted British Conservative MP Fiona Bruce as one of three advisers \u2013 the others were former prime ministers of Mongolia and Libya \u2013 and claimed to operate in New York, London and Shanghai. (Like many who have worked with Hong, Bruce declined to comment.)</p> <p>The institute never lived up to the hype, organising only a tiny number of events. It did boost Hong\u2019s profile, though, and in March 2016, he was invited to speak to the Canadian senate\u2019s standing committee on human rights. That day he was in messianic mode, stating that dialogue with Pyongyang on human rights was pointless. \u201cThey\u2019ve tortured themselves into a corner,\u201d he argued, while continuing to insist that North Korea was \u201con the cusp of the change\u201d. </p> <p>It is not clear when Hong first met his alleged future accomplice Ahn, but Ahn\u2019s early life, growing up in LA\u2019s large Korean community, was also rooted in church and family. Like Hong, Ahn had been a serious teenager. He once phoned a local radio station to lament Americans\u2019 \u201clack of patriotism\u201d. At 19, Ahn joined the marines and went on to serve for six years. \u201cAs a Korean-American, I really treasured the soldiers and marines who lost their lives to liberate Korea,\u201d he told the Washington Times for a 2008 article about Vets for Freedom, a Republican-aligned advocacy group. \u201cI always viewed my service as kind of paying it forward.\u201d Colleagues claim that Ahn later ran up a large personal debt to help both Vets for Freedom and out-of-luck veterans.</p> <p>By early 2017, Ahn and Hong were undoubtedly in contact, since the two were about to undertake an extraordinary secret mission in response to an event that made headlines around the world. On 13 February 2017, Kim Jong-un\u2019s exiled half-brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/16/kim-jong-nam-killing-what-we-know\" title=\"\">Kim Jong-nam, was murdered</a> at Kuala Lumpur airport when assassins tricked two women into squirting him with VX nerve agent for a fake TV prank. In the immediate aftermath of this assassination, there was reason to believe that the rest of Kim Jong-nam\u2019s family were in grave danger. But the family were quickly spirited away to safety from their home in Macau.</p> <p>The following month, a 40-second video appeared on YouTube, featuring Kim Jong-nam\u2019s son, Han-sol. \u201cMy father has been killed a few days ago. I am currently with my mother and sister,\u201d said Han-sol in English. He continued, \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to \u2013 \u201d, before the sound on the video cut out, preserving the anonymity of the people who helped him to safety. The video was posted by a previously unknown group named Cheollima Civil Defense, which also published a statement on their website thanking the governments of the Netherlands, China, the US and one unnamed nation for their assistance in rescuing Han-sol and his family. Cheollima Civil Defense later renamed itself Free Joseon.</p> <p>After the Madrid attack, with Spanish authorities having broken Hong\u2019s cover, Free Joseon released the unredacted version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90nOmu9g-r4\" title=\"\">Han-sol\u2019s video</a>, in which he thanks \u201cAdrian and his team\u201d for their help. According to Free Joseon\u2019s website, Hong was assisted by Ahn, who \u201cpersonally protected and escorted Kim Han Sol and his family\u201d. It was only then, two years after the incident, that the identity of the people behind Han-sol and his family\u2019s escape from danger was revealed. \u201cI was impressed they managed to maintain secrecy for so long. That shows great discipline,\u201d says Lee, who was \u201cstunned\u201d to see Hong revealed as the man behind the rescue mission.</p> <p>A separate website, Freedom for Free Joseon, set up this summer to defend Hong and Ahn, makes some extravagant claims about their importance. \u201cThese men, as part of the provisional government of Free Joseon, represent the first legitimate threat to Pyongyang in decades,\u201d it claims. Earlier this year, Hong\u2019s organisation also began selling advanced 45-day visitor visas \u201cto visit Free Joseon (previously North Korea) upon liberation\u201d. These must be paid with cryptocurrency and cost one Ethereum, currently worth around $225.</p> <p>Hong has done remarkable things in the past, but analysts say his government-in-exile is more fantasy than reality. Speaking about the embassy raid, Jean H Lee, a former AP news agency bureau chief in Pyongyang who now works at the Wilson Center thinktank, told me that she believes \u201cthese actions have jeopardised lives on all sides: their own, those of defectors they have extracted, and those in the embassy\u201d.</p> <p>The Free Joseon website provides a contact email address, but messages I sent over several weeks remain unanswered. There is, however, at least one public figure willing to defend the group.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lee Wolosky is a deeply connected Washington insider who held antiterrorism roles under presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton, served as Barack Obama\u2019s special envoy for Guant\u00e1namo closure, and has now taken on a new role, as Hong\u2019s lawyer. Wolosky has appeared on Fox and CNN to discuss Hong\u2019s case. \u201cWe are dismayed that the US Department of Justice has decided to execute warrants against US persons that derive from criminal complaints filed by the North Korean regime,\u201d Wolosky said in a statement posted on the Free Joseon website. (Wolosky confirmed to me that the statement was genuine, but declined to talk further.)</p> <p>A source close to Wolosky told me he was working pro bono, at the request of \u201ca friend\u201d outside government who is not associated with Korea. His involvement, nevertheless, raises questions about who is backing Hong\u2019s buccaneering \u201cliberators\u201d. Foreign dissident groups such as Free Joseon are quick to exploit the factionalism of Washington, and few issues offer as many opportunities as Trump\u2019s flirtation with Kim. Hong has occasionally moved in similar circles to John Bolton, the ultra-hawkish US national security adviser, who has previously called for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea and who, some observers believe, wants to undermine <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/04/18/trump-kim-korea-meeting-hanoi/\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s attempts</a> to reach a nuclear agreement with Pyongyang. Wolosky is also a lawyer for United Against Nuclear Iran, a group co-founded by Bolton that describes Kim and the ayatollahs as \u201cnuclear proliferation partners\u201d. Free Joseon says it also wants to prevent weapons sales to Iran. (The CIA has denied any role in the affair, and there is no evidence to suggest any direct connection between Bolton and Free Joseon.) </p> <p>The failure of the Hanoi summit and recent tit-for-tat military exercises and missile launches have not erased the fear among North Korea hawks that Trump might do a deal favourable to Kim\u2019s regime. Lankov agrees that Kim will never give up nuclear arms, but says Free Joseon\u2019s dreams of an Arab spring-style uprising are also fantasy. \u201cIf they have a rebellion, they will just machine-gun protesters,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Nor will North Korea\u2019s elites allow Kim to renounce nuclear arms, since these guarantee their own long-term power and safety. Yet those same elites expect Kim to deliver relief from sanctions. Trump, meanwhile, is thinking about re-election in 2020. \u201cBolton has been pushed aside. Donald Trump just wants something to show voters,\u201d Lankov told me after another trip to Washington in July. He foresees an imperfect, partial deal that will eventually fall apart, but with a triumphant Trump crowing that he has \u201csolved the north Korean nuclear problem\u201d. As China grows, however, the influence of Trump or his successors compared to Xi Jinping and future Chinese leaders will wane considerably. \u201cThe US\u2019s window of opportunity for shaping the future of an Asia-Pacific nuclear player is closing,\u201d Robert Kelly of Pusan National University told me.</p> <p>In the meantime, will the men behind Free Joseon get away with their audacious actions? In a remarkable twist, Ahn was released on $1.3m bail in July, despite the fact that almost all US citizens sought on international arrest warrants from Europe are routinely held in custody. The court decision, which allows Ahn to wear a tracking device and live at home in LA while awaiting a full extradition hearing early next year was, in the words of his lawyer Naeun Rim, \u201cvery rare\u201d. Rim argues that Spain\u2019s warrant is based on unreliable evidence from servants of Kim\u2019s regime, and the judge accepted FBI evidence that Ahn was at risk from North Korean assassins. \u201cIt\u2019s a life or death situation for him,\u201d Rim told me. She is likely to present similar arguments at Ahn\u2019s full extradition hearing next year, when the bar for avoiding being sent to Spain will be much higher. Minimum sentences there for both illegal detention and belonging to a criminal organisation are four years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/30/north-korea-us-nuclear-diplomacy-agreed-framework-1999-pyongyang-mission\">Two minutes to midnight: did the US miss its chance to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite Free Joseon\u2019s apparent amateurishness and self-glorification, the group has highlighted a key political problem by styling itself as a \u201cprovisional government\u201d for North Korea.

Yet it also defies expectations of an eventual reunification of the two Koreas. In fact, joining the poor North to the wealthy South is so fraught with cultural and other complications that it makes Germany\u2019s tortured reunification seem simple. Many in the South already fret about the immense cost, while their government continues to run a ministry of unification. \u201cIf the North Koreans can just hang on another generation or so they won\u2019t need to worry about unification, because the two Koreas are growing so far apart,\u201d argues Kelly.</p> <p>The Madrid raid may eventually become an anecdote in the tragic story of Korea under the Kims.

On 6 September, Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told Kansas radio station KCMO that the love affair would be back on soon. If Kim gave up nuclear weapons, he suggested, he could do anything else he wanted. \u201cEvery nation has the sovereign right to defend itself,\u201d Pompeo said. Kim is famous for finding creative ways of doing that. Stories of enemies being liquidated with flamethrowers, anti-tank guns or even piranha fish may prove to be exaggerations, but he was happy to kill his brother with a nerve agent. Millions of North Koreans, meanwhile, continue to struggle with abject poverty and repression.

      "bodyText": "Shortly before 5pm on 22 February, a suited man with a lapel pin bearing the dimpled face of Kim Jong-un rang the doorbell of the North Korean embassy in Madrid. The man had visited the embassy before. Fifteen days earlier, he had been turned away by an official who was suspicious of his claims that he was a businessman hoping to invest in North Korea. Before he left, the visitor gave the official his card, which said he ran a Dubai-based investment fund named Baron Stone Capital. Now the visitor had returned, claiming he had a gift for the embassy\u2019s senior official, So Yun-sok. This time, he was ushered inside and asked to wait in the courtyard between the compound\u2019s main two-storey building and its solid metal outer gate. While the official went to look for Mr So, the visitor walked to the perimeter of the compound and surreptitiously released the lock on the outside gate. A few moments later, a group of men carrying combat knives, iron bars, handcuffs and fake pistols burst through the embassy door. According to a 14-page summary of the incident by the Spanish high court judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata, within minutes all four male employees at the embassy had been tied up and bundled into a first-floor meeting room. The assailants, some wearing black balaclavas and others with their faces uncovered, spoke in American English and the distinctive Korean of Seoul and the South. Mr So\u2019s wife, named in Spanish court documents as Jang Ok Gyong, was watching television with their eight-year-old son when she heard what sounded like a struggle in the hallway. She locked the room, but soon the assailants forced their way in, though they insisted they would do her no harm. For the next four hours, she and her son were held captive, watched by a man with a black scarf over his face, a body camera and what seemed like a real gun in a holster. She claims she was so terrified that she secretly grabbed a razor to slit her wrists, but was unable to follow through. Instead, she and her son huddled together under a blanket. In the meeting room, according to testimony from the embassy staff, the assailants placed black hoods over the hostages\u2019 heads, swapped some of the plastic cable ties they had used to secure the hostages for handcuffs, and ordered them to sit in silence. One assailant was allegedly overheard asking another exactly how many people were taking part. \u201cThere are 11 of us,\u201d was the reply. The senior official, So Yun-sok, was then taken down to the basement, where the group finally revealed one of its aims. They wanted him to defect. Diplomatic defections are one of North Korea\u2019s most visible problems, and in recent years there have been two high-profile cases. Just a few months before the embassy raid, in late 2018, the acting ambassador to Italy had abandoned his post and gone into hiding. Two years earlier, the deputy ambassador in London, Thae Yong-ho, became the most senior North Korean official to defect to South Korea. In the basement, the attackers told So Yun-sok they wanted him \u201cto become the ambassador of a new state set up by them \u2013 a \u2018free\u2019 state,\u201d he later told Spanish investigators. The men claimed that \u201cthe North Korean government has very little time left\u201d and said other groups were \u201cgoing to do the same thing\u201d. Yet there were no embassy raids in other countries, and Mr So refused to defect. From this point onwards, the assailants\u2019 plan began to fall apart. Eventually, with Spanish police outside the embassy growing increasingly suspicious, the men decided to make their getaway. They were remarkably successful. More than six months later, only one of the group allegedly involved in the raid has been detained \u2013 a 38-year-old former US marine sergeant, Christopher Ahn. A global manhunt is under way for up to 10 more assailants. After the attackers fled, in the days and weeks that followed, details about their identities and aims started to trickle out, leaving as many questions as answers. The group seemed to be largely comprised of Korean Americans, South Koreans and North Korean defectors. But who were they? What did they want? Why did they fly across the world to attack an embassy in Europe? And what was the significance of the fact that one alleged member of the group turned out to have impressive connections within Washington? Alongside the obvious strangeness of the raid itself, Korea-watchers were struck by the timing. A few days later, Donald Trump was due to meet Kim for a summit in Hanoi to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Was that why this mysterious group raided the embassy? Spanish investigators remain puzzled, but Mario Esteban, a Korea expert at Madrid\u2019s Elcano thinktank, believes it was an attempt to disrupt Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim. \u201cIt was a very risky thing to do, in a friendly country, just before Hanoi \u2013 and messy,\u201d he told me. \u201cNothing else makes sense.\u201d That, however, is not what the attackers say. * * * Three days after the attack, an obscure dissident group called Free Joseon, or Free North Korea, claimed responsibility, and later announced they were forming a rebel government-in-exile. \u201cWe hereby take into our own hands our destiny and duty,\u201d the group declared. Prior to the Madrid attack, only the most eager Korea-watchers had heard of this group, and observers are still piecing together clues about the group\u2019s members and backers. \u201cIt\u2019s a radical group of people you can call zealots, heroes or fanatics, depending on your point of view,\u201d Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, a leading expert on North Korea, told me by phone from Seoul. There are two opposing versions of events inside the embassy, neither of them fully reliable. One comes from Free Joseon\u2019s website, which strongly denies that violence was used. Its official line is that the group were responding to a request from embassy officials, who had contacted Free Joseon for help in defecting. The second version comes from the hostages, who included the wives of two officials and an eight-year-old child. As servants of Kim\u2019s murderous and paranoid regime, they must be careful not to upset their leader or his enforcers. Yet Spanish investigators found enough evidence in witness statements, police evidence and an embassy search to issue arrest warrants for \u201crobbery with violence and intimidation\u201d, \u201cillegal restraint\u201d, \u201cthreats\u201d, \u201ccausing injuries\u201d and membership of a criminal gang. The embassy officials described an experience similar to that of US army captives in Iraq, where Ahn\u2019s battalion once ran a Fallujah detention centre. (Sources close to Ahn told me he was not the only military veteran involved in the raid, but refused to specify which country\u2019s armed services the others had served in.) The rights and wrongs of the case should eventually be decided at a trial in Madrid \u2013 that is, if the suspects can be located, the US agrees to Spain\u2019s request for American suspects to be extradited, and North Korea allows its embassy staff to be cross-examined. In the meantime, court and police documents originating from Spain, Italy and the US point to three key, US-based players. First, there is the group\u2019s alleged leader: Adrian Hong. A wanted poster, released by US marshals, says Hong uses at least two aliases, is \u201cconsidered to be armed and dangerous\u201d and had been seen driving around Los Angeles in a large white Kia Soul SUV with a licence plate that read \u201cArdent\u201d. It was Hong who posed as an investor when he first approached the embassy in early February. In reality, Hong is a Los Angeles-based, Yale-educated Mexican-Korean, with a long history of peaceful activism on issues relating to North Korea. News of Hong\u2019s alleged involvement in the raid astonished many who knew him. \u201cYou could have knocked me over with a gnat\u2019s wing,\u201d wrote Joshua Stanton, a Washington lawyer and author of the long-running Free Korea blog. Yet Spanish \u201cgovernment sources\u201d told the newspaper El Pa\u00eds that the country\u2019s intelligence services had proof that Hong and at least one other group member had been in contact with the CIA. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have said that if they weren\u2019t sure,\u201d claimed Esteban. (The state department has denied any US involvement.) The apparent second-in-command was Samuel Ryu, a 28-year-old American who had allegedly been preparing the raid for months, but who remains a mystery. Then, there is Ahn, the former US marine sergeant, who was arrested in Los Angeles on 18 April and is fighting extradition to Spain. Ahn has not denied being present, but his lawyers claimed in court that the embassy takeover was peaceful. Although the Madrid raid seems like a curious sideshow, it is worth recalling the stakes being played for in North Korea. These include nuclear warheads, chemical weapons, a brutal regime that murders and tortures, seven decades of armed standoff and tens of millions of Koreans potentially exposed to the deadly fallout should the Korean war ever start again. Many observers believe Trump is so keen to burnish his reputation by striking a historic deal with North Korea that he is making dangerous and foolish concessions to Pyongyang, without doing anything meaningful to reduce the nuclear threat that Kim\u2019s regime poses. If Free Joseon\u2019s aim really was to disrupt the Hanoi summit in February, they were not the only ones who were looking ahead to that meeting with concern. \u201cPeople were afraid that Trump would basically sign everything to North Korea,\u201d explains Lankov, who was in Washington at the time. \u201cThat was not just [a view held by] conspiracy theorists, but amongst very serious people.\u201d * * * On a sweltering July afternoon in Madrid, I called the North Korean official, So Yun-sok, to ask him about the raid. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about that,\u201d was his abrupt reply. In Spain, however, you do not need a diplomat to hear the Kim regime\u2019s official version of events. Instead, you can turn to an eccentric Catalan aristocrat called Alejandro Cao de Ben\u00f3s. Cao de Ben\u00f3s is, for all intents and purposes, head of global PR for North Korea, running an international network of cheerleaders for a country that sits at, or near, the bottom of most global lists for human rights. The 45-year-old Spaniard comes and goes from the Madrid embassy, vets and filters people wishing to visit the country, and ensures visas are issued for selected journalists, investors and tourists. In the past, he ran the Pyongyang Caf\u00e9, a North Korean-themed bar in his home city of Tarragona. For ceremonial occasions Cao de Ben\u00f3s dresses in a uniform festooned with medals, with gold lapel tabs and topped by a peaked officer\u2019s cap with a red band. In conversation, he comes over as a cross between the enthusiastic promoter of an exotic tourist destination and a cold war-style critic of the \u201csatanic\u201d US. He denies that Pyongyang\u2019s notorious regime tortures and executes dissidents. He is, in other words, an extremely unreliable source \u2013 but one with access to at least some inside information. Cao de Ben\u00f3s forwarded me an email he received on 4 February from an \u201cElena S\u00e1nchez\u201d, who claimed to be associate director of Baron Stone Capital. The investment fund had supposedly earmarked up to $50m to invest in \u201cinfrastructure, mining and energy\u201d in North Korea, Mongolia and Myanmar. Its managing director was due in Madrid. Could he visit the embassy? \u201cI started to vet them but the answer, for the moment, was \u2018no\u2019,\u201d Cao de Ben\u00f3s told me. Baron Stone Capital does not appear to be a real company, and it has no presence at the Dubai address where it supposedly had an office. It was three days after the email arrived that Adrian Hong first appeared at the embassy gate. He showed a fake Italian driving licence and, after being refused entry, left behind his Baron Stone business card. The following day, Hong flew from Spain to the Czech capital, Prague, but at least one of his alleged accomplices, Samuel Ryu, remained in Spain, staying at the Eurostars Zarzuela Park hotel, just 300 metres from the embassy. In June 2018, Ryu had lodged there for five nights with five South Koreans aged between 22 and 25, at least three of whom appear to have returned to participate in the embassy raid. It seems plausible that they made that trip to scope out their target. Far from being the bunkered fortress that one might expect, the Madrid embassy is a low, beige and brown building, surrounded by rough land, with rickety- looking security cameras and the sort of low walls that a bored teenager might be tempted to jump. It is an easy, isolated target, sitting on an island of scrubby, undeveloped land in a remote corner of Madrid\u2019s exclusive Moncloa-Aravaca neighbourhood. That, Lankov told me, might help explain why it was chosen for the raid. Apart from three embassy cars, a thief would have found little of value inside. North Korea is poor, and economic sanctions are hitting hard. The cash-strapped embassy housed just one diplomat, his family and three \u201cadministrative staff\u201d (plus one staff member\u2019s wife), who also did the gardening and acted as doormen. In sweltering Madrid, the embassy has a single air-conditioning unit that is wheeled out for visitors. The building\u2019s insurance policy lapsed last year. On 20 February 2019, two days before the raid, Hong returned to Madrid and renewed his passport at the Mexican embassy. By then, most of his team were already in the city and had begun buying equipment for the raid, making two visits to a large hardware store called Ferreteria Delicias. \u201cIt was odd because they were buying the sort of things you need for breaking into somewhere, but they were smart-looking and didn\u2019t seem suspicious,\u201d the store owner, Ram\u00f3n Villar, told me. Among the items they bought were 10 iron crowbars, bolt cutters, a telescopic ladder, pliers and tape. Hong, meanwhile, visited a self-styled \u201cpolice boutique\u201d called Shoke, which attracts self-defence hobbyists and Madrid cops wanting to stock up on everything from extra holsters and handcuffs to badges and boots. He bought four combat knives, five pairs of metal handcuffs, balaclavas, some quick-draw gun holsters and six authentic-looking pistols, which were actually harmless \u201cairsoft\u201d pellet guns. The bill came to \u20ac833.15. It appears that one of the last to join the team was Ahn, who only arrived on a flight from New York at 8am on the morning of the embassy takeover. By midday on 22 February, with Trump due in Hanoi five days later, the team were ready. * * * If Free Joseon\u2019s first mistake that afternoon was having no real Plan B in the event that So Yun-sok did not defect, their other major blunder was to leave an embassy resident unaccounted for. After the raid began, the wife of one of the administrative workers, named in court documents as Cho Sun Hi, locked herself in an upstairs room. She was terrified. In North Korea, South Koreans and, especially, Americans are painted as violent monsters. \u201cI\u2019d always been taught that it [the US] was the enemy, full of big-nosed, big-eyed, vicious people who\u2019d killed my countrymen,\u201d the defector Joseph Kim writes in his memoir Under the Same Sky. Afraid of what the captors might do, Cho Sun Hi, who is 56, climbed on to a balcony and jumped into the garden, injuring her leg and cutting her head on a stone tile in the process. She then crawled across a paddle tennis court to a back gate, emerging bloodied and dirty on to the street. Seeing her in distress, a passing driver took her a few blocks away to the gates of a private clinic, though she spoke no Spanish and could not explain what was happening. Her wounds were tended to inside an ambulance that was called to the clinic. She only felt safe, she said later, after insisting they call the police. Through a translation app, she was able to explain to the police and ambulance crew that the embassy had been assaulted. It sounded absurd, but a patrol car was dispatched. When police knocked on the door of the embassy, it was opened by a polite man in a suit, with a Kim Jong-un badge on his lapel. This was Hong. All was well, he told them. Police cannot enter a diplomatic delegation \u2013 which is inviolable and immune from search \u2013 without permission. Just in case, however, they waited nearby. Inside the building, the assailants were beginning to panic. So Yun-sok had refused to defect, and now the police were outside. It was time to go. They took the keys to the three embassy cars and sped out of the compound, leaving behind only Hong and one accomplice. The cars were dumped in Madrid and the neighbouring town of Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n over the ensuing hour, one with its doors open and the motor still running. Back in the embassy, a few minutes earlier, Hong had ordered an Uber using the alias \u201cOswaldo Trump\u201d. Now it was outside, parked in front of the embassy. But the police were there, too, and three North Korean students who had been trying to contact friends inside the embassy were preparing to jump over the garden wall to see what was going on. Instead of leaving in the Uber, Hong cancelled the ride and changed his plan. He and his accomplice went out the back way, through the overgrown plot behind the compound. A second Uber, again ordered by Oswaldo Trump, was waiting for him on a different street. Just as Hong was escaping, the hostages were starting to free themselves. One rubbed his face on a sofa to lift the bag off his head, while Jang Ok Gyong found a knife to cut the remaining plastic cable ties. Within minutes, they spilled on to the street in front of the startled Spanish police officers. At least one man was still wearing handcuffs. The raid had not exactly gone to plan, but it had not been a total failure. While the embassy staff were tied up, the assailants filmed themselves smashing portraits of the Kim family in a separate room. They later sent a video to Fox News. The symbolic potency of this is considerable, Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea expert at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, told me. \u201cIt cracks the taboo that the Kim regime is inviolable and cannot be desecrated,\u201d he says. They also stole So Yun-sok\u2019s mobile phone as well as flash drives, and broke open computers to extract hard drives. All of the men involved managed to get away from the scene of the crime safely. The team fled to Lisbon, a six-hour drive away \u2013 with Spain\u2019s ABC newspaper reporting that Hong took his Uber all the way, paying \u20ac900. On 23 February, accompanied by Ryu and two others, Hong flew from Lisbon to Newark, New Jersey. Then, on 27 February, as Trump was meeting Kim in Hanoi, Hong made a puzzling decision: he contacted the FBI, explaining what he had done and handing over the stolen computer drives. Hong wasn\u2019t detained at that point, since Spain had yet to issue arrest warrants. He was, however, admitting to having committed a serious felony in a friendly country, and when he met FBI agents again in mid-March, he also detailed Ahn\u2019s role. This led to warrants being issued 10 days later and brought Ahn\u2019s arrest (US marshals found him at Hong\u2019s apartment), while Hong himself went on the run and has not been caught. The question is why, after conceiving an elaborate plot, then bungling it, then evading capture, Hong would decide to admit it all to the authorities, only to then disappear again. * * * Adrian Hong arrived in the US in 1991 as a seven-year-old boy. His father Joseph was a taekwondo champion and Christian missionary who had emigrated from South Korea to Tijuana, Mexico \u2013 where Hong was born, and his father taught martial arts under the nickname \u201cEl Tigre\u201d \u2013 before moving a dozen miles across the border to Chula Vista, San Diego. The family eventually settled into a suburban house backing on to a busy freeway. Hong inherited his father\u2019s missionary zeal. As a 17-year-old Yale freshman, he wrote to the Korea Herald, an English-language newspaper in Seoul, to berate young Koreans and Korean-Americans for lacking \u201cpassion for their nation\u201d while sporting the \u201chorrible-looking haircuts and clothes styles\u201d inspired by early K-pop. He described himself as a proud Korean patriot who was \u201cashamed\u201d of his people for their political apathy and loose morals. Determination, charisma and righteous conviction took Hong a long way. In 2004, he helped to host the annual Korean American Students Conference in New Haven, where he co-founded an organisation called Liberation for North Korea, or Link. Link, which later changed its name to Liberty in North Korea, was spectacularly successful. Some four years later, aged just 22, Hong was running an NGO with 100 campus chapters worldwide, an annual income of $143,000 and funding from Washington\u2019s Freedom House thinktank. Link\u2019s co-founder was Paul Kim, a Korean-American comedian known as PK. In April, a couple of months after the embassy raid, Kim received a visit from US marshals on the hunt for Hong, though he didn\u2019t know his old friend\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cHe\u2019s not the bad guy here. He\u2019s one of the smartest guys I know, and also one of the most eloquent writers,\u201d Kim told me on the phone from Los Angeles. Kim also recalled that Hong\u2019s strident activism sometimes failed to impress native Koreans. When American members of Hong\u2019s organisation set up mock funerals in Seoul to highlight the plight of North Korea\u2019s citizens, many locals took offence. \u201cPeople were like: \u2018You don\u2019t live here, you don\u2019t understand. Don\u2019t tell us what to do\u2019,\u201d said Kim. Hong\u2019s grand passion was helping refugees from North Korea. Any North Korean who manages to escape across the border to China faces a difficult path. If Chinese police catch them, they are sent back home, where they risk instant punishment. Most who manage to evade capture are forced to live clandestinely, often in poverty, or end up falling victim to people-traffickers. Link became one of several groups running \u201cunderground railroads\u201d, helping defectors make their way to South Korea or beyond. These still operate today, and Link has rescued more than 1,000 people over the past decade. Hong would sometimes travel to China to assist with Link\u2019s work, displaying the bravery and apparent calmness under pressure that he would later show in Madrid. In some cases, he accompanied young escapees through China personally, buying them fashionable clothes and teaching them to pass as spoiled Korean Americans so that they could travel more freely. \u201cHe was young, his hair was cut in a stylish way, and his clothes were American and very hip. Everything about him, in fact, was cool,\u201d wrote Joseph Kim in Under the Same Sky, after Hong calmly walked him into a US consulate in China. But, just like in Madrid, Hong also had a tendency to overreach and to place exaggerated faith in his own abilities, with disastrous consequences. In December 2006, Hong attempted to force the US consulate in Shenyang, a city in north-eastern China, to admit six North Korean refugees. The plan misfired. His team and the refugees were all arrested, though Hong\u2019s eight days in jail were minor compared to the months of prison suffered by others who have been caught helping refugees over the past decade. Tim Peters of Helping Hands Korea, a Christian NGO, told me that Hong\u2019s rashness in Shenyang had alarmed those who had spent years quietly building escape networks. \u201cIt really sent shock tremors through the whole community,\u201d he said. Although the Shenyang Six were allowed to leave the country eight months later, extra Chinese guards were placed around consulates, making it \u201cless likely than ever\u201d that escapees could seek asylum in the US, noted the journalist Melanie Kirkpatrick in her book Escape from North Korea. After Madrid, Peters worries people will conflate the underground railroad with violent attacks such as the embassy raid. \u201cThat\u2019s political,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we, or others, do.\u201d Link has also distanced itself from Hong, pointing out that it has been more than a decade since he was involved with the group. However, sources at Spain\u2019s National Court confirmed to me that it has also issued a warrant for Cheol (or Charles) Ryu, a 25-year-old US citizen who fled North Korea as a teenager, posts on Instagram as @freshprinceofpyongyang (bio: \u201cjust chillin\u2019 in USA until I can go back to the Hermit Kingdom\u201d) and worked with Link until late last year. \u201cIt appears that he was contacted by Adrian Hong and, unbeknownst to our organisation, recruited to be involved in Free Joseon\u2019s activities after leaving Link,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO, Hannah Song, said in a statement sent to me by Link. Ryu has not responded to my emails or Facebook messages. A fifth warrant has been issued in the name of South Korean Woo Ran Lee, the same sources said. * * * In 2008, back when Hong decided to leave Link to devote himself to political advocacy, he wrote a farewell note. \u201cLiberty will come for the North Koreans soon,\u201d he promised. From that time onwards, his movements become harder to piece together. What is certain is that he built contacts in Washington, thinktanks and academia, becoming accepted as a serious advocate for change in Korea. He was involved in several social start-ups and became a TED Fellow in 2009, networking and creating independent conferences about political change in Asia and Africa. In 2011, after Libya\u2019s leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed, Hong organised a conference in the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli, hailing the Arab spring as \u201ca dress rehearsal for North Korea\u201d. Yet the Kim regime stayed stubbornly in place. In Washington and elsewhere, Hong won admirers. He had strong enough connections to secure five visits to the White House between 2011 and 2012, and has photographs with Barack Obama to prove it. \u201cHe is a very suave, charming personality in any social setting \u2013 self-confident, but not arrogant,\u201d said Lee, who invited him to talks to his students at Tufts in 2013 after Hong had set up an NGO consultancy called Pegasus Strategies. How Hong made money during this time remains an unresolved question, though South Korea\u2019s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper has claimed, without offering evidence, that \u201chis consulting work often involved the CIA\u201d. Whatever the case, in retrospect it seems that Hong\u2019s impatience for change was growing. In 2015, Hong created the Joseon Institute. Its mission statement predicted \u201cseismic shifts in the near term\u201d and spoke of preparing administrators for a free North Korea. It boasted British Conservative MP Fiona Bruce as one of three advisers \u2013 the others were former prime ministers of Mongolia and Libya \u2013 and claimed to operate in New York, London and Shanghai. (Like many who have worked with Hong, Bruce declined to comment.) The institute never lived up to the hype, organising only a tiny number of events. It did boost Hong\u2019s profile, though, and in March 2016, he was invited to speak to the Canadian senate\u2019s standing committee on human rights. That day he was in messianic mode, stating that dialogue with Pyongyang on human rights was pointless. \u201cThey\u2019ve tortured themselves into a corner,\u201d he argued, while continuing to insist that North Korea was \u201con the cusp of the change\u201d. It is not clear when Hong first met his alleged future accomplice Ahn, but Ahn\u2019s early life, growing up in LA\u2019s large Korean community, was also rooted in church and family. Like Hong, Ahn had been a serious teenager. He once phoned a local radio station to lament Americans\u2019 \u201clack of patriotism\u201d. At 19, Ahn joined the marines and went on to serve for six years. \u201cAs a Korean-American, I really treasured the soldiers and marines who lost their lives to liberate Korea,\u201d he told the Washington Times for a 2008 article about Vets for Freedom, a Republican-aligned advocacy group. \u201cI always viewed my service as kind of paying it forward.\u201d Colleagues claim that Ahn later ran up a large personal debt to help both Vets for Freedom and out-of-luck veterans. By early 2017, Ahn and Hong were undoubtedly in contact, since the two were about to undertake an extraordinary secret mission in response to an event that made headlines around the world. On 13 February 2017, Kim Jong-un\u2019s exiled half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was murdered at Kuala Lumpur airport when assassins tricked two women into squirting him with VX nerve agent for a fake TV prank. In the immediate aftermath of this assassination, there was reason to believe that the rest of Kim Jong-nam\u2019s family were in grave danger. But the family were quickly spirited away to safety from their home in Macau. The following month, a 40-second video appeared on YouTube, featuring Kim Jong-nam\u2019s son, Han-sol. \u201cMy father has been killed a few days ago. I am currently with my mother and sister,\u201d said Han-sol in English. He continued, \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to \u2013 \u201d, before the sound on the video cut out, preserving the anonymity of the people who helped him to safety. The video was posted by a previously unknown group named Cheollima Civil Defense, which also published a statement on their website thanking the governments of the Netherlands, China, the US and one unnamed nation for their assistance in rescuing Han-sol and his family. Cheollima Civil Defense later renamed itself Free Joseon. After the Madrid attack, with Spanish authorities having broken Hong\u2019s cover, Free Joseon released the unredacted version of Han-sol\u2019s video, in which he thanks \u201cAdrian and his team\u201d for their help. According to Free Joseon\u2019s website, Hong was assisted by Ahn, who \u201cpersonally protected and escorted Kim Han Sol and his family\u201d. It was only then, two years after the incident, that the identity of the people behind Han-sol and his family\u2019s escape from danger was revealed. \u201cI was impressed they managed to maintain secrecy for so long. That shows great discipline,\u201d says Lee, who was \u201cstunned\u201d to see Hong revealed as the man behind the rescue mission. A separate website, Freedom for Free Joseon, set up this summer to defend Hong and Ahn, makes some extravagant claims about their importance. \u201cThese men, as part of the provisional government of Free Joseon, represent the first legitimate threat to Pyongyang in decades,\u201d it claims. Earlier this year, Hong\u2019s organisation also began selling advanced 45-day visitor visas \u201cto visit Free Joseon (previously North Korea) upon liberation\u201d. These must be paid with cryptocurrency and cost one Ethereum, currently worth around $225. Hong has done remarkable things in the past, but analysts say his government-in-exile is more fantasy than reality. Speaking about the embassy raid, Jean H Lee, a former AP news agency bureau chief in Pyongyang who now works at the Wilson Center thinktank, told me that she believes \u201cthese actions have jeopardised lives on all sides: their own, those of defectors they have extracted, and those in the embassy\u201d. The Free Joseon website provides a contact email address, but messages I sent over several weeks remain unanswered. There is, however, at least one public figure willing to defend the group. * * * Lee Wolosky is a deeply connected Washington insider who held antiterrorism roles under presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton, served as Barack Obama\u2019s special envoy for Guant\u00e1namo closure, and has now taken on a new role, as Hong\u2019s lawyer. Wolosky has appeared on Fox and CNN to discuss Hong\u2019s case. \u201cWe are dismayed that the US Department of Justice has decided to execute warrants against US persons that derive from criminal complaints filed by the North Korean regime,\u201d Wolosky said in a statement posted on the Free Joseon website. (Wolosky confirmed to me that the statement was genuine, but declined to talk further.) A source close to Wolosky told me he was working pro bono, at the request of \u201ca friend\u201d outside government who is not associated with Korea. His involvement, nevertheless, raises questions about who is backing Hong\u2019s buccaneering \u201cliberators\u201d. Foreign dissident groups such as Free Joseon are quick to exploit the factionalism of Washington, and few issues offer as many opportunities as Trump\u2019s flirtation with Kim. Hong has occasionally moved in similar circles to John Bolton, the ultra-hawkish US national security adviser, who has previously called for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea and who, some observers believe, wants to undermine Trump\u2019s attempts to reach a nuclear agreement with Pyongyang. Wolosky is also a lawyer for United Against Nuclear Iran, a group co-founded by Bolton that describes Kim and the ayatollahs as \u201cnuclear proliferation partners\u201d. Free Joseon says it also wants to prevent weapons sales to Iran. (The CIA has denied any role in the affair, and there is no evidence to suggest any direct connection between Bolton and Free Joseon.) The failure of the Hanoi summit and recent tit-for-tat military exercises and missile launches have not erased the fear among North Korea hawks that Trump might do a deal favourable to Kim\u2019s regime. Lankov agrees that Kim will never give up nuclear arms, but says Free Joseon\u2019s dreams of an Arab spring-style uprising are also fantasy. \u201cIf they have a rebellion, they will just machine-gun protesters,\u201d he told me. Nor will North Korea\u2019s elites allow Kim to renounce nuclear arms, since these guarantee their own long-term power and safety. Yet those same elites expect Kim to deliver relief from sanctions. Trump, meanwhile, is thinking about re-election in 2020. \u201cBolton has been pushed aside. Donald Trump just wants something to show voters,\u201d Lankov told me after another trip to Washington in July. He foresees an imperfect, partial deal that will eventually fall apart, but with a triumphant Trump crowing that he has \u201csolved the north Korean nuclear problem\u201d. As China grows, however, the influence of Trump or his successors compared to Xi Jinping and future Chinese leaders will wane considerably. \u201cThe US\u2019s window of opportunity for shaping the future of an Asia-Pacific nuclear player is closing,\u201d Robert Kelly of Pusan National University told me. In the meantime, will the men behind Free Joseon get away with their audacious actions? In a remarkable twist, Ahn was released on $1.3m bail in July, despite the fact that almost all US citizens sought on international arrest warrants from Europe are routinely held in custody. The court decision, which allows Ahn to wear a tracking device and live at home in LA while awaiting a full extradition hearing early next year was, in the words of his lawyer Naeun Rim, \u201cvery rare\u201d. Rim argues that Spain\u2019s warrant is based on unreliable evidence from servants of Kim\u2019s regime, and the judge accepted FBI evidence that Ahn was at risk from North Korean assassins. \u201cIt\u2019s a life or death situation for him,\u201d Rim told me. She is likely to present similar arguments at Ahn\u2019s full extradition hearing next year, when the bar for avoiding being sent to Spain will be much higher. Minimum sentences there for both illegal detention and belonging to a criminal organisation are four years. Despite Free Joseon\u2019s apparent amateurishness and self-glorification, the group has highlighted a key political problem by styling itself as a \u201cprovisional government\u201d for North Korea. This fits Korean history, with a government-in-exile first challenging Japanese colonial rule early in the 20th century. Yet it also defies expectations of an eventual reunification of the two Koreas. In fact, joining the poor North to the wealthy South is so fraught with cultural and other complications that it makes Germany\u2019s tortured reunification seem simple. Many in the South already fret about the immense cost, while their government continues to run a ministry of unification. \u201cIf the North Koreans can just hang on another generation or so they won\u2019t need to worry about unification, because the two Koreas are growing so far apart,\u201d argues Kelly. The Madrid raid may eventually become an anecdote in the tragic story of Korea under the Kims. If it was an attempt to stymie Trump\u2019s talks, it failed. \u201cWe fell in love \u2026 No really, he wrote me beautiful letters,\u201d Trump insisted when he and Kim began their flirtation a year ago. On 6 September, Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told Kansas radio station KCMO that the love affair would be back on soon. If Kim gave up nuclear weapons, he suggested, he could do anything else he wanted. \u201cEvery nation has the sovereign right to defend itself,\u201d Pompeo said. Kim is famous for finding creative ways of doing that. Stories of enemies being liquidated with flamethrowers, anti-tank guns or even piranha fish may prove to be exaggerations, but he was happy to kill his brother with a nerve agent. Millions of North Koreans, meanwhile, continue to struggle with abject poverty and repression. Freeing Joseon, surely, means getting rid of more than just its nuclear weapons. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019 because an earlier version said that a diplomatic delegation was \u201csovereign foreign territory\u201d. Under the Vienna Convention, while a foreign embassy building is inviolable and immune to search, it is not formally \u201csovereign territory\u201d of the embassy\u2019s country. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "bodyText": "Society must prepare for a technological revolution in which brain implants allow people to communicate by telepathy, download new skills, and brag about their holidays in \u201cneural postcards\u201d, leading scientists say. While such far-fetched applications remain fiction for now, research into brain implants and other neural devices is advancing so fast that the Royal Society has called for a \u201cnational investigation\u201d into the technology. \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time this is probably going to touch millions of people,\u201d said Tim Constandinou, director of the next generation neural interfaces lab at Imperial College London, and co-chair of a new Royal Society report called iHuman. \u201cThese technologies are not possible today, but we are heading in that direction.\u201d The report foresees a \u201cneural revolution\u201d driven by electronic implants that communicate directly with the brain and other parts of the nervous system. By 2040, the scientists anticipate that implants will help the paralysed to walk, with other devices alleviating the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and treatment-resistant depression. The new wave of devices will go beyond existing products such as cochlear implant hearing aids and deep brain stimulators for people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, with gadgets that help the healthy. In research labs, scientists are working on ways for people to type with their brains, and share thoughts by connecting their minds. Other teams are developing helmets and headbands to speed up learning and improve memory. \u201cPeople could become telepathic to some degree, able to converse not only without speaking but without words, through access to each other\u2019s thoughts at a conceptual level. This could enable unprecedented collaboration with colleagues and deeper conversations with friends,\u201d the report states. But with such new powers come new risks, the report adds. Expensive brain-boosting devices may become luxury items in richer nations, leaving poorer countries behind. And with devices plugged directly into the brain, people\u2019s most intimate data could be used against them. \u201cAccess to people\u2019s thoughts, moods and motivations could lead to abuse of human rights,\u201d the report says, adding that some companies might expect their employees to wear devices that reveal their inner feelings. The report calls for the public to be consulted \u201cearly and often\u201d about the ethical issues that neural implants throw up, and proposes a regulatory body akin to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to police how new devices are used. \u201cAs our experience with social media has shown, we do need to think ahead about who will control this data and what it might be used for, to guard against possible harmful uses,\u201d said Sarah Chan, a co-author on the report at Edinburgh University. \u201cIf recent experience has shown us anything, it\u2019s that individual consent and opting in or out is not enough to protect either individuals or society more widely.\u201d But Constandinou warned against overregulation that could cripple new technologies before they leave the lab. \u201cWe need safeguards to ensure things are not misused, but we shouldn\u2019t shoot ourselves in the foot,\u201d he said. \u201cThis technology could massively improve the quality of life for millions of people,\u201d he added.",

For British Brexiters, the reward will be cheaper goods for consumers on low incomes. Both parties see the EU regulations on these standards, such as its ban on imports of poultry washed with chlorine, as unnecessary and at root protectionist. Chlorinated chicken has become totemic because it encapsulates a much wider argument over what sort of agriculture the world needs and how far we should regulate it.</p> <p>We chlorinate our water, so what\u2019s the problem with using chlorine washes to make chicken safe? <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49353220\" title=\"\">Why all the fuss</a>, asked Zippy Duvall, the head of the US farmers\u2019 lobby group, on the BBC\u2019s Today programme last month. The fact that we disinfect water with chlorine will not do as an argument here, despite Duvall\u2019s hopes. We disinfect our lavatories with it, too. The issue of safety depends on concentration. The World Health Organization recommends water supplies are treated with a maximum of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chlorine.pdf\" title=\"\">5mg of chlorine per litre</a>.

      "body": "<h2>Phil Daniels, played Jimmy</h2> <p>I wasn\u2019t well when I went for the auditions at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. I\u2019d been in South Africa filming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/29/books.schools\">Zulu Dawn</a> and got some sort of disease. I looked washed out. When the director Franc Roddam saw how sick I was, he told me to go home, but I was asked back for a screen test. When I heard that Johnny Rotten was no longer being considered for the lead role, I thought: \u201cWell, this is it.\u201d</p> <p>Roddam had us hang out for a month before filming started. He encouraged the depraved side of our nature \u2013 he was not one for tucking us into bed at night. We wore authentic clothes and were given lessons in how to dance and ride a scooter \u2013 and we got to hang out with some original mods. We were living it, doing all sorts of stuff to get us into the mood. That\u2019s why it looks like we aren\u2019t acting.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLuDb6N8v10\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nLuDb6N8v10?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLuDb6N8v10\">Watch a trailer for Quadrophenia</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>We shot the end of the film first, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/06/tom-hunt-beachy-head-suicide-cliffs-despair\">Beachy Head</a>. Riding along the clifftop, I got a lot closer to the edge than I was meant to and fell off the scooter a couple of times. I remember the first assistant director, Ray Corbett, telling me: \u201cListen, it\u2019s the third day. If you fell off that cliff, d\u2019you know what would have happened? They would have recast you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Jimmy\u2019s not a hero, he\u2019s just a normal boy next door, and that\u2019s what makes him work.

I\u2019d been in South Africa filming Zulu Dawn and got some sort of disease. I looked washed out. When the director Franc Roddam saw how sick I was, he told me to go home, but I was asked back for a screen test. When I heard that Johnny Rotten was no longer being considered for the lead role, I thought: \u201cWell, this is it.\u201d Roddam had us hang out for a month before filming started. He encouraged the depraved side of our nature \u2013 he was not one for tucking us into bed at night. We wore authentic clothes and were given lessons in how to dance and ride a scooter \u2013 and we got to hang out with some original mods. We were living it, doing all sorts of stuff to get us into the mood. That\u2019s why it looks like we aren\u2019t acting. We shot the end of the film first, at Beachy Head. Riding along the clifftop, I got a lot closer to the edge than I was meant to and fell off the scooter a couple of times. I remember the first assistant director, Ray Corbett, telling me: \u201cListen, it\u2019s the third day. If you fell off that cliff, d\u2019you know what would have happened? They would have recast you tomorrow.\u201d Jimmy\u2019s not a hero, he\u2019s just a normal boy next door, and that\u2019s what makes him work. He ultimately rejects the whole ethos of being a mod \u2013 making your whole life revolve around sitting on a silly scooter. In the end, he had to jack it in to move on.

Adding poetic musings, facts and speculative theories to the works, the students interpreted a range of scenes \u2013 from visiting-room weddings and ice sculpture-carving contests to family visits and attempted escapes. Presented without context, the diagrammed images are time capsules that chart how the culture of San Quentin has evolved from the 60s to the present. (In the 60s, prisoners weren\u2019t required to wear uniforms; in the 50s, an elementary school for prison staff families was almost entirely composed of white children.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"b323570fdf2e925356d2cc178f0e0240a4eca70d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b323570fdf2e925356d2cc178f0e0240a4eca70d/0_9_660_976/338.jpg\" alt=\"Fish Caught at Ranch 9-17-75 from Mapping Archive Images, 2013\" width=\"338\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish Caught at Ranch 9-17-75 from Mapping Archive Images, 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Poor/Monta Kevin Tindall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"bc50aaefa70f35faff65b26b237bf7066197c3a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc50aaefa70f35faff65b26b237bf7066197c3a0/16_14_660_976/338.jpg\" alt=\"Fight in School Building 3-25-66, 1966, printed 2018.\" width=\"338\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fight in School Building 3-25-66, 1966, printed 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Unknown/Nigel Poor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Right: This image from 1966 captures the fall-out from a fight in one of San Quentin\u2019s school buildings.</p></li> <li><p>Left: A 1975 image titled Fish Caught at Ranch. \u2018The black-and-white film can\u2019t hide the colors of the mind,\u2019 writes Tindall.</p></li> </ul> <p>In the mapped images, life at San Quentin is shown to be rife with contradictions \u2013 quotidian and unusual, peaceable yet marked with violence and trauma. Inspired by the artists Jim Goldberg, Bill Owens, and Sophie Calle, Poor sees the photographs as collaborative projects in which her students\u2019 perspectives are at the focus, while she still plays an active role. (On gallery signage, she and her students are equally credited as artists.)</p> <p>\u201cI always remember that I can walk out of prison but the people I work with can\u2019t,\u201d Poor says. </p> <p>Throughout the series, there are clear-eyed observations of panopticon-oriented surveillance methods, including mounted cameras, barbed wire, and gun towers. In some cases, the students\u2019 notes read as damning indictments of the prison staff\u2019s cruelty or negligence. Other notes are heartfelt and reflective, upending cliches around prison life as necessarily brutal and those incarcerated as one-dimensional individuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da06ada0757737fe9582682f8457999ef369ed28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da06ada0757737fe9582682f8457999ef369ed28/0_0_1032_664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gym Profile 7-15-75 from Mapping Archive Images, 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gym Profile 7-15-75 from Mapping Archive Images, 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harold Meeks/Nigel Poor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>\u2018In this era, staying fit was key to survival behind these walls / if not, you\u2019ll become a victim,\u2019 writes Harold Meeks, who is currently incarcerated, about this image from 1975.</p></li> </ul> <p>While some men at San Quentin can now wield cameras \u2013 for their internal newspaper, if supervised by guards \u2013 the majority don\u2019t have access. \u201cThe person with the camera has all the control,\u201d Poor points out. This project therefore explores a redistribution of power by questioning who has the authority to capture personal narratives and institutional histories.</p> <p>\u201cIt blows my mind that correctional officers were using these four-by-five cameras up until the early 80s because it\u2019s such a cumbersome camera to use,\u201d Poor says. \u201cThe negatives are really beautiful. It makes me think: how many other prisons have these archives? I don\u2019t think San Quentin is unique.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWas he pushed or did he jump?\u201d is scrawled in the margins of a black-and-white photograph of four dark figures surrounding the chalk outline of a body. In the image, there are patches of stained asphalt encircled by inky black pen marks. Four dark figures surround the chalk outline of a body in a 1964 image. Taken at San Quentin state prison nearly 50 years ago by a correctional officer (CO), the photograph is one of 30 archival images on view at Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (Bampfa). The artist Nigel Poor, who is best known for the acclaimed prison podcast Ear Hustle, which she co-created with Earlonne Woods and now has over 10 million listeners, uncovered the images in 2011 . Left: An on-duty guard and incarcerated man meet the photographer\u2019s lens head-on \u2013 creating an unnerving sense of tension in an otherwise clinical photo. Right: Another photo in the same series. \u2018The hand holding the cuff seems uncommonly loose, yet control can be seen,\u2019 writes Kevin Tindall, who was formerly incarcerated. A year later, she dusted off nine banker\u2019s boxes that were stowed underneath a high-ranking CO\u2019s desk and encountered thousands of four-by-five-inch negatives from the 60s and 70s. \u201cIt was like a treasure hunt,\u201d says the artist, who scanned and printed the most evocative photos. \u201cI\u2019d find really amazing and surprising images, then horrific, charming, funny, or scary ones. And then there\u2019s incredibly brutal photos that really cement you in the reality of being in prison. Images that I find disturbing seem to be more about humiliation, though, than outright violence.\u201d Mesro Coles-El, another of Poor\u2019s students, selected this photo of a man in Native American costume \u2013 adding his own questions about the event, cultural tradition, and intended audience for the ritual. In a photography course that she still teaches through the not-for-profit initiative Prison University Project, Poor engaged her students \u2013 incarcerated at San Quentin \u2013 with visual mapping exercises encouraging them to write and draw directly on to the found photos. Adding poetic musings, facts and speculative theories to the works, the students interpreted a range of scenes \u2013 from visiting-room weddings and ice sculpture-carving contests to family visits and attempted escapes. Presented without context, the diagrammed images are time capsules that chart how the culture of San Quentin has evolved from the 60s to the present. (In the 60s, prisoners weren\u2019t required to wear uniforms; in the 50s, an elementary school for prison staff families was almost entirely composed of white children.) Right: This image from 1966 captures the fall-out from a fight in one of San Quentin\u2019s school buildings. Left: A 1975 image titled Fish Caught at Ranch. \u2018The black-and-white film can\u2019t hide the colors of the mind,\u2019 writes Tindall. In the mapped images, life at San Quentin is shown to be rife with contradictions \u2013 quotidian and unusual, peaceable yet marked with violence and trauma. Inspired by the artists Jim Goldberg, Bill Owens, and Sophie Calle, Poor sees the photographs as collaborative projects in which her students\u2019 perspectives are at the focus, while she still plays an active role. (On gallery signage, she and her students are equally credited as artists.) \u201cI always remember that I can walk out of prison but the people I work with can\u2019t,\u201d Poor says. Throughout the series, there are clear-eyed observations of panopticon-oriented surveillance methods, including mounted cameras, barbed wire, and gun towers. In some cases, the students\u2019 notes read as damning indictments of the prison staff\u2019s cruelty or negligence. Other notes are heartfelt and reflective, upending cliches around prison life as necessarily brutal and those incarcerated as one-dimensional individuals. \u2018In this era, staying fit was key to survival behind these walls / if not, you\u2019ll become a victim,\u2019 writes Harold Meeks, who is currently incarcerated, about this image from 1975. While some men at San Quentin can now wield cameras \u2013 for their internal newspaper, if supervised by guards \u2013 the majority don\u2019t have access. \u201cThe person with the camera has all the control,\u201d Poor points out. This project therefore explores a redistribution of power by questioning who has the authority to capture personal narratives and institutional histories. \u201cIt blows my mind that correctional officers were using these four-by-five cameras up until the early 80s because it\u2019s such a cumbersome camera to use,\u201d Poor says. \u201cThe negatives are really beautiful. It makes me think: how many other prisons have these archives? I don\u2019t think San Quentin is unique. I would love to be able to do this inside of other prisons \u2013 like in juvenile facilities or working with women.\u201d Top: One of Poor\u2019s students, Ruben Ramirez, reimagines this man\u2019s body as a castle and the outstretched arms holding him up as two buttresses. Bottom: Shadeed Wallace-Stepter, who has since been released from San Quentin, observes that it\u2019s difficult to discern which man is incarcerated because none of them are in uniform. The photo was found in an envelope marked \u2018Mother\u2019s Day 1976\u2019. \u201cI do wish more prisons could be like San Quentin, with good programming that had more than AA and NA. Here, there\u2019s yoga classes, a Shakespeare group, meditation groups, a newspaper, radio program, gardening, and cooking classes,\u201d she says. \u201cGuys try to transfer to San Quentin from other prisons because of its reputation. It\u2019s not a war zone, which is how I\u2019ve heard guys describe a level 4 prison, where every time you leave your cell you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll make it back.\u201d (San Quentin is a medium-security, level 2 prison.) Yet, the project also raises the question of whether it\u2019s possible for a prison, even one with programming as progressive as San Quentin\u2019s, to be a dignified place to live. This photograph of a man playing chess was selected by Mesro Coles-El for visual mapping exercises. \u201cMaybe this programming is deceptive, because San Quentin is also where death row is housed in California,\u201d she explains. Even though the governor, Gavin Newsom, signed an order in March that imposed a moratorium on California\u2019s death penalty, 737 men are still on death row in San Quentin prison, which is about a quarter of the total number of people on death row in the US. As of this summer, four of the men that participated in Poor\u2019s classes are out of prison \u2013 and working janitorial, tech, and security jobs \u2013 while the rest continue to live behind bars.

Another US study in the 1970s found people at camp, men and women, conformed with the <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37774592.pdf\" title=\"\">gender roles </a><a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37774592.pdf\" title=\"\">that were the norm at home</a>.</p> <p>Although social patterns in society have become more fluid since then, in most campsites a strong gendered division of play persists. Men are more likely to tend fires while women prepare vegetables and salads. Recent studies have found that when women step outside traditional gender roles at camp, they can face subtle and not <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b281/8c3525d70a20070c9cbfbc3a69b185ebf802.pdf\" title=\"\">so subtle forms of sexism</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, people often say the thing they like most about camping is that it <a href=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2010_garst_b001.pdf\" title=\"\">offers an escape from work</a>.

In the past, campers typically connected with people across the whole campsite. Today\u2019s campers tend to socialise only with people in their immediate party.

But of course what Mr Wong was telling me at the time wasn\u2019t so clear at the time or straightforward.\u201d Asked what he believed to be Wong\u2019s intention during the meeting, Tong responded: \u201cI was very clear that his intention for me was to continue with the lies.\u201d Tong said he barely knew the politician, was surprised to be summonsed to his office, and did not know how Wong knew what evidence he had previously given to electoral authorities. Tong told the commission he went home and wrote down a complete recollection of the encounter because he became suspicious about being asked to hand over his phone. He said he sent the written recollection of the meeting to Zhan, of Wu International. It has also been tendered to Icac. Zhan, the only other person in the room, has earlier given evidence that he remembers nothing of what was said during the meeting. He said he may have been playing on his phone, visiting the toilet or admiring the view from Wong\u2019s office. Tong said Zhan did not have his phone at the time and did not go to the toilet. The commission also heard more about the links between Wu International and political figures. The firm\u2019s boss, Bobby Wu, has been pictured with former prime ministers John Howard and Kevin Rudd, Tong told the inquiry. He also said Wu was involved in the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China. That organisation was chaired for a long time by Huang and has been linked with the Chinese Communist Party. In November, Tong was summonsed to give evidence to Icac. On the same night he received his summons, Tong received a home visit from Alex Wu, the most senior-ranking Wu International employee in Australia, and Zhan. The pair came to his home. He got in their car, and the three of them drove around the streets for 10 to 20 minutes, Tong said. \u201cAlex said to me \u2018just stick with what you had said earlier then it will be fine\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI said \u2018OK, I\u2019ll do what you\u2019ve said\u2019. That\u2019s why on my first appearance [to Icac] I told lies.\u201d The inquiry continues on Tuesday before chief commissioner, Peter Hall.",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><br><br>Queensland\u2019s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, has announced a taskforce to investigate the lighting of eight separate fires in the past few days.</p> \n<p>It was initially reported that 10 homes had been destroyed in the Peregian area, but the overnight efforts of firefighters appear to have prevented damage to all but a couple of homes and businesses.

One senior police official was criticised by experts after he claimed the number was higher than 11 million. A 2011 census had set it at 2.2 million.</p> \n<p>The recent attacks have drawn criticism from across the continent. In Nigeria, where South Africa\u2019s diplomatic representations have been closed, South African-owned shops have also been attacked.</p> \n<p>Last week, South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/south-african-president-condemns-anti-foreigner-violence\">made a televised address</a> calling for an end to the attacks, asking citizens to remember the role others on the continent played in the decades-long battle against the repressive, racist apartheid regime.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"09c9fbc91b6e5cf31bfe739af8b8aaa96f1675ac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c9fbc91b6e5cf31bfe739af8b8aaa96f1675ac/0_219_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People rummage through items from looted foreign-owned shops in Alexandra township in Johannesburg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People rummage through items from looted foreign-owned shops in Alexandra township.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Marc Gbaffou from the African Diaspora Forum, an umbrella group that campaigns for the rights of migrants in South Africa, said there was no political will to stop the violence. \u201cNow the whole world has seen the truth,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Even though the violence on Sunday was concentrated in the impoverished centre of Johannesburg, there are fears it will spread to neighbourhoods such as Mayfair, in the west, which have long been popular with migrants.</p> \n<p>Mayfair residents boast you can hear 30 African languages spoken on its streets and find followers of every faith, while the area has welcomed many new arrivals.</p> \n<p>It is also a much-needed \u201csafe haven\u201d in times of trouble, said Sheikh.

      "bodyText": "In the Kismayo meat restaurant at the heart of the Mayfair neighbourhood of Johannesburg, the elders of the city\u2019s Somali community hold urgent meetings about the attacks on foreign-owned businesses and traders that have been surging for more than a week. On Sunday, two people were reportedly killed and the police had to use teargas and rubber bullets to disperse groups of men armed with machetes and sticks while shouting anti-immigrant slogans. Officials believe at least 11 people have died and scores of shops have been burned. Many more have been injured and looting has been widespread. The elders have many questions: when will the next outbreak be? What will the government do? Will their families, homes and businessmen ever be safe? Amir Sheikh, a community leader who came from Somalia 16 years ago, said: \u201cEvery day we are living in fear.\u201d According to community leaders, the attacks last week had been building for several months. Anti-immigrant rhetoric has been circulating on social media and among groups who allege immigrants cheat their customers with out-of-date produce in their shops, take jobs from locals and defraud the state. Among the victims of the recent attacks were dozens of Bangladeshi shopkeepers including Salahuddin Abdulhilim, who fled political violence in Dhaka nine years ago to start a new life in Soweto, one of Johannesburg\u2019s townships, where he owns a small supermarket. \u201cI came to work, to earn a living. I pay my taxes, employ seven South African workers, all my papers are in order,\u201d he said. Abdulhilim, 39, joined hundreds of others who fled to Mayfair in recent days. Many have lost their businesses \u2013 burned to the ground, or thoroughly looted. Most had to face terrifying ordeals as they tried to prevent often dozens of men armed with sticks, knives, petrol bombs and sometimes guns from breaking into their shops. \u201cIt was very frightening \u2026 We ran. They were coming in with crowbars and hammers \u2026 We used to hear of an incident here or there, but now it is all the time. People are dying. It has been getting worse and worse. We are a target and no one wants to protect us,\u201d Abdulhilim said. Violent incidents have been reported in other parts of the country. According to local media, two people were killed and more than 30 arrested near Cape Town when mobs attacked and looted foreign-owned shops on Sunday. Most migrants in South Africa come from neighbouring countries, especially Zimbabwe, where decades of economic and political instability have forced many of the former British colony\u2019s most talented, motivated and educated overseas. The exact number of immigrants in South Africa, which has a population of 56 million, is unknown. One senior police official was criticised by experts after he claimed the number was higher than 11 million. A 2011 census had set it at 2.2 million. The recent attacks have drawn criticism from across the continent. In Nigeria, where South Africa\u2019s diplomatic representations have been closed, South African-owned shops have also been attacked. Last week, South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, made a televised address calling for an end to the attacks, asking citizens to remember the role others on the continent played in the decades-long battle against the repressive, racist apartheid regime. But Marc Gbaffou from the African Diaspora Forum, an umbrella group that campaigns for the rights of migrants in South Africa, said there was no political will to stop the violence. \u201cNow the whole world has seen the truth,\u201d he said. Even though the violence on Sunday was concentrated in the impoverished centre of Johannesburg, there are fears it will spread to neighbourhoods such as Mayfair, in the west, which have long been popular with migrants. Mayfair residents boast you can hear 30 African languages spoken on its streets and find followers of every faith, while the area has welcomed many new arrivals. It is also a much-needed \u201csafe haven\u201d in times of trouble, said Sheikh. Nevertheless, in recent days stores, shisha shops and tailoring sweatshops in Mayfair had to bring down their shutters on two occasions, fearing attacks. The few attempts by groups of thugs to spread the violence into Mayfair were seen off by local men. But the growing anger is directed not just at the attackers but also what is seen as ineffectual policing. \u201cThe police are part and parcel of this. They have been harassing migrants for months, using bad language, beating, taking goods,\u201d said Sheikh. In 2015, seven people were reported killed during outbreaks of xenophobic violence in Johannesburg and Durban. In 2008, more than 60 people died in a more intense outbreak. Experts cite multiple causes. South Africa has some of the highest levels of violent crime in the world, with soaring unemployment, extreme inequality and patchy policing. Representatives of migrant communities accuse senior officials in the ruling African National Congress and other politicians of using xenophobic language that encourages attacks. On Sunday, a statement by the ANC called for an end to the attacks on migrants and but also for tighter border controls, adding that \u201claw-abiding citizens are understandably sick of those who are breaking the moral fibre of our society by turning our kids into prostitutes and drug addicts\u201d. Loren Landau of the African Centre for Migration and Society at Witwatersrand University said the specific location of xenophobic violence often depended on complex social and political factors on the ground. \u201cThis is not just about people who are poor and disappointed \u2026 a lot is about local-level politics,\u201d he said.",

Speaker of the House, <strong>John Bercow</strong>, expressed his anger at the suspension of proceedings, saying it was \u201cnot a normal prorogation. It is not typical. It is not standard. It\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents... an act of executive fiat\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>A group of opposition MPs, carrying signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d tried to prevent the Speaker <strong>John Bercow </strong>from exiting his chair to go to the House of Lords to complete prorogation proceedings. As Conservatives left the chamber with the Speaker to attend the House of Lords, Labour MPs chanted \u201cShame on you!\u201d at them, while they remained in parliament singing Red Flag, Calon L\u00e2n (in Welsh), and Scots Wha Hae.<br><br></li> \n   <li>A thunderous Bercow returned to the House of Commons to confirm the prorogation of parliament, but only a handful of Conservative MPs returned, painting a striking visual of empty government and packed opposition benches.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Earlier in the day, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> once again failed in his attempt to force an early general election after opposition MPs abstained and Labour leader <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> said he would not let his party walk into \u201ctraps laid by this prime minister\u201d. This was the sixth parliamentary defeat for the prime minister in a week, more defeats than Thatcher, Major, Blair or Brown had in their entire tenures as PM. <br><br></li> \n   <li>Despite royal assent being given to legislation requiring a delay to Brexit beyond October 31 unless a divorce deal is approved or parliament agrees to leave the EU without one by 19 October , Johnson insisted he would not ask for another Brexit delay. <br><br></li> \n   <li>Speaker <strong>John Bercow</strong> announced his intention to stand down next month, leading to both tributes and criticism in the House.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>MPs voted narrowly to demand the government publish all written and electronic contact connected to prorogation and no-deal Brexit planning.

The other defeats were: on the Oliver Letwin motion allowing time for the Benn bill, on the Benn bill at second and third reading and on holding an early election. The final vote counted as a defeat, because Johnson did not get the required two-thirds majority, although technically he won, because more MPs voted in favour than against.</p> \n  <p>But what does this defeat mean?</p> \n  <p>Humble addresses are considered binding on the government. The passing of this motion (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d7698698f082514879f0f03#block-5d7698698f082514879f0f03\">7.24pm)</a> means the government is now obliged to release to the Commons:</p> \n  <p>1) all private messages sent between nine advisers, including Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s de facto chief of staff, including text and WhatsApp messages and private emails, sent from 23 July relating to the prorogation of parliament.</p> \n  <p>2) all the documents prepared within government since 23 July 2019 relating to operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee.</p> \n  <p>The motion mentions 23 July because that is the day Boris Johnson became Tory leader. He become prime minister the following day.</p> \n  <p>The material is meant to be handed over by 11 September.</p> \n  <p>However, it does not seem likely that the government will comply. The Commons will not even be sitting on Wednesday. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs that he wanted to publish some version of the Operation Yellowhammer document anyway. But during the debate Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, suggested that the government would not have the legal power to enforce the release of the internal prorogation messages, even if it wanted to comply. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d7682528f083106f4558549#block-5d7682528f083106f4558549\"> 5.51pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>Last year Labour used the humble address mechanism to require the publication of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice about the withdrawal agreement. The government initially ignored the request, and it only complied a month later when MPs passed <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2018/december/contempt-motion-on-publishing-of-legal-advice/\">another motion finding the government in contempt of parliament.</a></p> \n  <p>In this case no such contempt motion will be passed any time soon, because after tonight the Commons will not be sitting until 14 October.</p> \n  <p>And even if it were passed, a contempt motion on its own would not necessarily force Boris Johnson\u2019s government to comply. Theresa May\u2019s government did, but May respected the authority of parliament. Johnson\u2019s administration seems much more contemptuous of it. </p> \n  <p>On other issues MPs and campaigners have threatened legal action, or gone to court, to ensure that Johnson complies with their wishes. But this vote is not a matter of legislation, and it does not relate to the exercise of prerogative powers. It is a Commons procedural matter, and so it is hard to see on what basis the courts could intervene.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for the night.

It would have been his first appearance before the committee, which questions prime ministers three times a year, for about 90 minutes at a time. But the decision to prorogue parliament means the committee hearing will not go ahead because Commons committees do not formally meet during prorogation.</p> \n  <p>But Sarah Wollaston, the committee\u2019s chair, has written to Johnson asking him to agree to meet them anyway, as he originally said he would.

The legal challengers in London say there is evidence that ministers themselves do not quite believe it.

At the 2017 election I promised my wife and children that it would be my last. This is a pledge that I intend to keep. If the house votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as Speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends. </p> \n   <p>If the house does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me stand down at the close of business on Thursday, 31 October. Least disruptive because that date will fall shortly after the votes on the Queen\u2019s speech expected on 21 and 22 October. </p> \n   <p>The week also after that may be quite lively and it would be best to have an experienced figure in the chair for that short period. <br></p> \n   <p>Most democratic because it will mean that a ballot is held when all members have some knowledge of the candidates. This is far preferable to a contest at the beginning of a parliament when new MPs will not be similarly informed and may find themselves vulnerable to undue institutional influence.<br></p> \n   <p>We would not want anyone to be whipped senseless, would we? Throughout my time as Speaker I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature for which I will make absolutely no apology to anyone, anywhere, at any time. <br></p> \n   <p>To deploy a perhaps dangerous phrase, I have also sought to be the backbencher\u2019s backstop.<br></p> \n   <p>I could not do so without the support of a small but superb team in Speaker\u2019s House, the wider house staff, my Buckingham constituents, and above all my wife, Sally, and our three children, Oliver, Freddy and Jemima. From the bottom of my heart, I thank them all profusely.<br></p> \n   <p>I could also not have served without the repeated support of this house and its members past and present. This is a wonderful place filled overwhelmingly by people who are motivated by their notion of the national interest by their perception of the public good. And by their duty, not as delegates, but as representatives, to do what they believe is right for our country.<br></p> \n   <p>We degrade this parliament at our peril. I have served as a member of parliament for 22 years, and for the last 10 as Speaker. This has been, let me put it explicitly, the greatest privilege and honour of my professional life for which I will be eternally grateful.</p> \n   <p>I wish my successor in the chair the very best fortune in standing up for the rights of honourable and right honourable members individually and for parliament institutionally as the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T15:11:13.063Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d76680f8f083106f45583bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T15:03:21.645Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is important to remember, of course, that only yesterday the Conservatives announced that they were going to field a candidate against John Bercow at the next election, even though the Speaker is normally given a clear run, because they had concluded he was biased against them on Brexit.

Here is the timetable for the rest of the day.</p> \n  <p>I use the word \u201ctimetable\u201d provisionally, because at this point it is not at all clear how long everything will take. In theory, if everything took the maximum amount of time allocated, the Commons could still be sitting at 8am tomorrow morning. No one expects that to happen. But the final vote, on whether or not to have an early election, may come at around 11pm.</p> \n  <p>Here is what we know.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, takes questions.</p> \n  <p><em>3.30pm:</em> Two MPs make applications for emergency debates under standing order 24. They are Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, and Jeremy Corbyn. Taking advantage of the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow SO24 motions to be used not just for neutral motions (ie, ones with no practical effect), Grieve has used the process to table a \u201chumble address\u201d that, if passed, forces the government to release written material. And he is asking for not just one batch of material, but two: all private correspondence relating to the decision to prorogue parliament, and the Operation Yellowhammer government no-deal planning documents. Corbyn\u2019s motion is about the rule of law, but I have not seen the text yet.</p> \n  <p>The Speaker will have to decide whether to accept one or both motions. Given the level of anger in the Commons about the prorogation decision, it is quite likely both will be allowed. </p> \n  <p>In theory each debate could last up to three hours, taking you to 10pm if both motions were to be put to a vote. But at Westminster today there is an assumption that MPs will get through the SO24 debate or debates more quickly.</p> \n  <p><em>Early evening?:</em> The government has tabled five motions under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. Up to 90 minutes is allocated for each debate, but it is understood that four of the motions will get pulled, and the other one is not expected to take the full 90 minutes.</p> \n  <p><em>Early/mid evening?:</em> MPs have to conclude the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill, which is returning from the Lords. Up to an hour has been set aside for this debate, but, again, it could wrap up more quickly than that.</p> \n  <p><em>9pm or later?:</em> MPs begin the 90-minute debate on Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election. Johnson is expected to win the vote technically, because most MPs voting are expected to vote in favour, but lose the vote in practical terms, because under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two thirds of MPs (434) must vote in favour for the election election to happen.</p> \n  <p><em>Around 11pm or later?: </em>Parliament prorogues. This involves<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentwork/offices-and-ceremonies/overview/prorogation1/prorogation/\"> a ceremony taking place in the House of Lords, </a>with MPs summoned to attend, as happens with the Queen\u2019s speech - only without the Queen.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T13:32:16.701Z\">at 2.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d76476e8f08143ee1ae2e28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T12:45:32.947Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, is suggesting Boris Johnson could be impeached if he ignores the law designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October<strong>.

During the summer it emerged that, when Boris Johnson was foreign secretary, he once said about Leo Varadkar: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/268b55ec-a891-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04\">\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?\u201d</a> Johnson campaigned for a policy outcome that will probably cause immense damage to the Irish economy, and for the last two years his Brexiter allies have frequently demonised Varadkar as the obstacle to a successful Brexit. Johnson then delayed his first visit to Dublin for weeks (despite this morning claiming that he believed it was important to speak to the Irish first \u2013 see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d7613748f082514879f08cf#block-5d7613748f082514879f08cf\">9.59am.)</a> Varadkar could be forgiven for wanting to tell him to take a jump.</p> \n  <p>Instead, Varadkar sounded sincere about wanting to ensure Ireland remains a friend to the UK in the future. (Realistically, that\u2019s the only sensible economic strategy.) And Johnson sounded considerably more measured and composed than he did in his public appearances on Thursday and Friday last week (not difficult). Perhaps shaken by the way people like his brother Jo Johnson and Amber Rudd have concluded he is not serious about finding a Brexit deal, he was much more negative about the reality of a no-deal Brexit than he has been for ages, describing it as \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But that did not prevent Johnson being disconcerted by some of the questions. He repeatedly dodged a question about when he last visited the Irish border. He ignored a question about whether he stood by the claim he one made about how technology could solve the border issue because that is how the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43210156\">congestion charge is enforced on the border between Camden and Islington.</a> And he was humbled by a brilliant question pointing out that, while he is happy to use \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d as a metaphor, Brexit undermines arrangements that have preserved the peace in an country where until recently hundreds of people did end up dead in ditches literally.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1170985585680498688\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Taoiseach <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeoVaradkar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LeoVaradkar</a> says the Government would oppose the introduction of Direct Rule in Northern Ireland, though he recognises the UK is the sovereign government in Northern Ireland | | Live <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#brexit</a> blog: <a href=\"https://t.co/4Vw0XGf8xm\">https://t.co/4Vw0XGf8xm</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wMHQP70CXA\">pic.twitter.com/wMHQP70CXA</a></p>\u2014 RT\u00c9 News (@rtenews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1170985585680498688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Johnson claimed to have \u201can abundance of proposals\u201d to resolve the backstop.

But this may be misconceived. As Varadkar argued forcefully in his opening remarks, there is no such thing as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d, and this problem will be with us for years.

He did not seem too bothered by Sumption\u2019s argument that the strategy outlined in the Daily Telegraph would be unlawful. He said he and his colleagues had been discussing in the House of Commons tearoom on Thursday what Boris Johnson might do to circumvent the law requiring him to ask for a no-deal Brexit, and Evans said: \u201cWe whittled them down to about 20.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He did not list all 20, but he referred to two: the government tabling a vote of no confidence in itself, or the government passing a one-line bill setting the date for an early election.</p> \n  <p>Evans also argued that, even though Johnson did not have the support of the Commons, he did have the backing of the public. Evans explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You have to remember, 400 MPs representing leave seats voted remain. You really do have parliament against the people. It\u2019s not a great look. And I will be standing alongside the prime minister in trying to deliver what the people voted for.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The two ideas Evans did propose are problematic. The government could in theory try to pass a vote of no confidence in itself, but that would open up a 14-day period during which MPs could agree to support an alternative PM and government. And it could try to pass primary legislation requiring an election on 15 October, but that would require a majority, which Johnson does not have, and it could be amended in ways unacceptable to Number 10.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T08:38:03.657Z\">at 9.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7609948f083106f4557ffb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T08:16:06.826Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another former lord chancellor, <strong>David Gauke</strong>, has also said that the plan to try to sabotage any letter sent to the EU requesting a Brexit delay with a second hostile letter would not work.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1170963962369728515\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sending two letters to the EU \"carries no weight\" says former justice secretary David Gauke<br><br>\"The consensus view in the legal world is that it's pretty watertight,\" he says of the act passed by Parliament to prevent a no-deal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a><a href=\"https://t.co/jI6cvXd5nN\">https://t.co/jI6cvXd5nN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gwHUJmjJkB\">pic.twitter.com/gwHUJmjJkB</a></p>\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1170963962369728515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Gauke, of course, is one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed last week after voting against the government on this issue.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d76093a8f082514879f0895\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T08:11:52.577Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m sorry comments were not open earlier.

In other circumstances, and for other individuals, that might be seen as a reasonable approach to taking a difficult decision.

Does that stop the prime minister sending other documents to the EU? I don\u2019t think it does.</p> \n   <p>\u201cA political explainer perhaps, as to where the government\u2019s policy is.

This would enable them to portray Johnson as having broken his key promise of delivering Brexit \u201ccome what may\u201d on 31 October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/the-boris-johnson-plan-and-how-it-fell-apart\">writes Michael Savage, in this very handy explainer</a> about what\u2019s been going on and what lies ahead.</li> \n   <li>Meanwhile, the backbench bill to block no deal <strong>is expected to receive royal assent today. </strong></li> \n   <li>If that goes ahead, <strong>the key question will be whether Johnson is somehow able to circumvent the legislation</strong> and go ahead with Brexit. There are reports swirling around that No 10 believes it can go to court to get around the law, but an equal number saying the government won\u2019t be able to. The latter point to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertBuckland/status/1170653531076026368\">a tweet by justice secretary Robert Buckland</a> that he has spoken to the PM \u201cregarding the importance of the rule of law\u201d.</li> \n   <li>There is the possibility that the EU could prevent Britain from delaying its exit anyway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/france-threatens-to-veto-further-brexit-extension\">according to our Brussels correspondent Daniel Boffey</a>.</li> \n   <li>And there is also <strong>the chance of further cabinet resignations</strong> following Rudd\u2019s decision to stand down. We report that she has been contacted by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers worried about the government\u2019s Brexit policy since tendering her resignation.</li> \n   <li>In all the chaos you might have missed the fact that <strong>Rudd was replaced as work and pensions secretary yesterday by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey</strong>, MP for Suffolk Coastal, a loyalist who was promoted from her role as environment minister.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>And I liked this picture of Johnson and his latest nemesis at the Tory conference last year.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up the blog now. Thank you to all of you absolute troopers who have stuck with us throughout this wild and prorogued night. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow as we report on the fallout of the crazy scenes we witnessed tonight. Until then! \u2018An act of executive fiat\u2019: Chaotic scenes as UK parliament suspended \u2013 video Parliament has been suspended until 14 October after a day and night of high drama that ended at about 2am. There were chaotic scenes as the prorogation formalities began in the early hours of Tuesday. Speaker of the House, John Bercow, expressed his anger at the suspension of proceedings, saying it was \u201cnot a normal prorogation. It is not typical. It is not standard. It\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents... an act of executive fiat\u201d. A group of opposition MPs, carrying signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d tried to prevent the Speaker John Bercow from exiting his chair to go to the House of Lords to complete prorogation proceedings. As Conservatives left the chamber with the Speaker to attend the House of Lords, Labour MPs chanted \u201cShame on you!\u201d at them, while they remained in parliament singing Red Flag, Calon L\u00e2n (in Welsh), and Scots Wha Hae. A thunderous Bercow returned to the House of Commons to confirm the prorogation of parliament, but only a handful of Conservative MPs returned, painting a striking visual of empty government and packed opposition benches. Earlier in the day, Boris Johnson once again failed in his attempt to force an early general election after opposition MPs abstained and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would not let his party walk into \u201ctraps laid by this prime minister\u201d. This was the sixth parliamentary defeat for the prime minister in a week, more defeats than Thatcher, Major, Blair or Brown had in their entire tenures as PM. Despite royal assent being given to legislation requiring a delay to Brexit beyond October 31 unless a divorce deal is approved or parliament agrees to leave the EU without one by 19 October , Johnson insisted he would not ask for another Brexit delay. Speaker John Bercow announced his intention to stand down next month, leading to both tributes and criticism in the House. MPs voted narrowly to demand the government publish all written and electronic contact connected to prorogation and no-deal Brexit planning. While the government agreed it would share \u201cappropriate information with parliament\u201d but argued the \u201cscope of the information requested disproportionate and unprecedented\u201d. The Liberal Democrats announced they are set to officially back revoking article 50 in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party, effectively severing the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election. \u2022 This summary was amended on 10 September 2019 because Plaid Cymru MPs sang Calon L\u00e2n, not Bread of Heaven as an earlier version said. More reaction coming in from MPs to the extraordinary night we\u2019ve just witnessed. They are all furious and disgusted, though the reason for their anger is pretty much split down party lines, with Conservatives MPs appalled at the opposition MPs who tried to stop John Bercow from leaving his seat in parliament, whereas Labour and other opposition MPs are angry at the proroguing of parliament. Both sides claim their opponents actions show them acting against the will of the people. Doesn\u2019t this feel like a long time ago now? But it was only about four hours ago that there was this heated exchange between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn about the calling of an election. A sign of just how long and how dramatic they day has been. Here\u2019s more from Alex Sobel, Labour MP, about what MPs were trying to do during that moment of altercation at the Speaker\u2019s chair during the prorogation proceedings. From what I witnessed, though a few MPs laid hands on John Bercow\u2019s arm and put their bodies between his chair and the floor, no one sat on him. Conservative MPs have condemned the opposition MPs who were involved in attempting to block the Speaker from leaving the chamber, including Assistant Government Whip Nigel Huddleston and Bob Seely, Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight, who condemned the Speaker for his behaviour today. With Trumpian syntax, Seely wrote: \u201cSpeaker loses plot at the end of parliament. Openly takes sides. Insults colleagues. Very sad.\u201d Here\u2019s some video of Scottish and Welsh MPs singing in the House as they waited for John Bercow to return from the House of Lords, where the prorogation formalities were taking place. While Conservative MPs left the House to go with Bercow and witness the suspension of parliament, opposition MPs remained in the Commons in protest at the prorogation. They filled their time with singing and from the feedback of MPs on Twitter, it appears the Welsh MPs, singing Bread of Heaven in Welsh, complete with harmonies, was judged the best of the bunch. Opposition MPs tried to physically stop the Speaker from going to Lords to prorogue parliament In case you missed it before, there were extraordinary scenes in the House after Black Rod came to address the Speaker, in which opposition MPs tried to physically stop the Speaker from leaving his chair to go out to the House of Lords to finish the prorogation formalities. Labour MP Rachael Maskell who was part of the group trying to stop Bercow\u2019s exit from the chamber posted this photograph of the moment as she reassured her followers: \u201cTonight I did everything I could to stop the Parliament being prorogued.\u201d Greens MP Caroline Lucas said the move was \u201cechoing the action of members to try to prevent the Speaker proroguing at the request of Charles I\u201d. Richard Wheeler, PA\u2019s parliamentary editor, calls tonight \u201carguably the most surreal time I\u2019ve spent in the Commons chamber in six-and-a-half years\u201d as Labour and opposition MPs remained in the chamber as the Speaker and Conservative MPs left to go to the House of Lords to watch the ceremony required for prorogation. Opposition MPs, holding up signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d, who chanted \u201cShame on you!\u201d as Conservative MPs left the chamber, started singing \u2013 Red Flag, Jerusalem, Flower of Scotland and Bread of Heaven. Parliament has been suspended until 14 October. Jeremy Corbyn is now shaking hands with John Bercow and Labour MPs are queued up to shake Bercow\u2019s hand. The Speaker is taking his time with each handshake, giving Ian Blackford a big pat of the back and a rub of the arm. Bercow now hugging John McDonell. This might take a while. The camera has just panned back and we can see nine Conservative MPs. The Conservative benches are almost empty, whereas the Labour benches are packed with MPs holding up signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d. These are quite extraordinary scenes. John Bercow is reading out what happened. He sounds incredibly bored. He is saying that the leader of the House of Lords addressed the group and gave assent to the proroguing of parliament. John Bercow has returned to the House of Commons, where he was given a huge round of applause by Labour MPs. \u201cI feel much more at home here,\u201d he says. The group \u2013 including Bercow and Black Rod \u2013 are now returning back to the House of Commons where opposition MPs have been singing. Lords have addressed the Speaker and ordered that parliament has been prorogued. There was a lot of hat-tipping and now the Speaker, Black Rod and other key MPs have left the Lords. There are some serious scenes going on right now, as opposition MPs band together in protest at the prorogation by singing. Opposition MPs were holding up signs in parliament saying \u201csilenced\u201d. And one of these signs has been left on the Speaker\u2019s chair. Labour MP Clive Lewis has posted a photograph of it alongside a quote suggesting what has happened today equates to \u201ctyranny\u201d. Bercow was loudly applauded by opposition MPs as he left the chamber. Labour MPs then chanted \u201cshame on you!\u201d to Conservatives as they exited. Some classic Bercow in that last speech, which he interrupted to address an MP who was heckling him (I missed the original comment), to which Bercow responded: \u201cI require no response from you Mr Stephenson! You wouldn\u2019t have the foggiest idea where to start in counselling me. I require no response from you, I require no response to you! Get out, man!\u201d The heckling continues, someone yells: \u201cAnti-deomocratic\u201d. Someone heckles the Speaker to \u201cdo your job for which you\u2019re handsomely paid\u201d. And he has walked out of the parliament, followed by MPs. MPs are chanting \u201cShame on you!\u201d as the Conservative benches empty. The Speaker says he treats Black Rod with respect and he understands that the Lords are doing what \u201cthey believe to be right\u201d. He says he is happy to play he part. But wants to point out: \u201cthis is not a standard or normal prorogation\u201d and that it \u201crepresents an act of executive fiat\u201d. Black Rod has entered and is addressing the Speaker. And we\u2019re back. The door has been ordered to be closed. Parliament was meant to be back five minutes ago, but is still not back. Maybe someone lost their ermine robe. A reminder that progroguing parliament does not just have implications for Brexit. Parliament will not sit again until 15 October and a host of bills will not be heard because of the break, including, as Jon Featonby from the British Red Cross points out, a bill about reuniting refugees in the UK with their family members. We are about two minutes away from parliament being prorogued. So, what is actually going to happen? My colleagues Martin Belam and Jessica Elgot have written this helpful guide including this information about the ceremony that is about to take place: You cannot do anything in Westminster without a bit of pomp and circumstance. A ceremony of prorogation involves a message from the Queen being read in the House of Lords, and then Black Rod summoning MPs from the Commons to the Lords. A list of all the bills passed by the parliament is read, followed by a speech on behalf of the Queen announcing what has been achieved by the government before MPs are sent home. Given what is on the order paper in parliament on Monday, this is likely to happen very late this evening. Good evening/early hours of the morning everyone. This is Kate Lyons taking over from Mattha Busby. Parliament has been suspended for 10 minutes to prepare for the prorogation formalities. Or as David Linden (SNP MP) put it \u201cso folk can get their ermine robes and funny hats on\u201d. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts says all the checks and balances of parlimentary democracy have been \u201cdeliberately stormed\u201d. When the government teeters between avoiding and evading the law, this is neither normal nor honourable. We desperately need a new politics of citizens conventions in every nation, of truth and conciliation in an informed referendum, with article 50 revoked if necessary for this to happen. The Green Party\u2019s Caroline Lucas says that events tonight have clearly shown that the political system is broken. It is wrong that a prime minister can suspend parliament as a mere inconvenience simply to avoid scrutiny. It is wrong that he can cynically try to use the proposals for a general election as a way of getting us to crash out of the EU while we\u2019re in the middle of a general election campaign. We can no longer continue with an uncodified constitution that depends on people playing by the rules when we have a feral government. Liberal Democrat MP Sir Ed Davey says his party is offering the prime minister a way out: \u201cPut it to the people in a People\u2019s Vote\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford says Johnson has lost every vote in the House of Commons since he became prime minister and predicted that he will be \u201cswept from government\u201d in the next election. The party\u2019s leader in Westminster declares he is looking forward to Scotland securing independence \u201caway from the clutches of a Tory Brexit Britain and an isolationist Britain taking us away from our partners and friends in the European Union\u201d. Amid mass abstentions, 293 MPs vote for the prime minister\u2019s motion, while 46 vote against it. The course of action required the support of two-thirds of MPs. \u201cThe majority does not satisfy the requirements of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act,\u201d the Speaker, John Bercow, confirms. \u201cI earlier urged the house to trust the people but once again, the opposition think they know better,\u201d says Boris Johnson, after his second attempt to trigger an early general election fails. \u201cThey want the British prime minister to go to a vital negotiation without the power to walk away. They want to delay Brexit yet again, without further reference to those who voted for it \u2026 And so now the house will move to adjourn and resume the state opening and the Queen\u2019s speech on October 14, and I hope the opposition will use that time to reflect. Meanwhile, this government will press on with negotiating a deal.\u201d Responding, Jeremy Corbyn says: \u201cThe one thing the prime minister didn\u2019t say was that he was going to obey the law of this country. He did not say, acknowledge or accept three votes that have taken place in this parliament, and under his request, the House is now due \u2013 apparently this evening \u2013 to be prorogued for one of the longest prorogations in history, simply in order to avoid any questioning of what he is doing or not doing \u2026 This government is a disgrace.\u201d Independent MP Ivan Lewis says parliament\u2019s handling of Brexit has reduced the UK to a \u201claughing stock around the world\u201d and warns of the economic consequences of the further insecurity \u2013 urging Brexit to be delivered. \u201cWhatever the deal is put to this house, there are many, many people who will vote against it because they want to thwart the terms of the referendum result,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is many of the so-called progressives in this house who are fuelling rightwing extremism by showing contempt for the result. One can\u2019t be a selective democrat.\u201d Tory MP Tom Tugenghat says the only answer to solving the current impasse is a general election. Shortly after, John Bercow calls for a division. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake attacks Corbyn for \u201ccampaigning for decades to leave the EU on any terms possible\u201d and criticises Labour MPs for opposing Theresa May\u2019s \u201csensible deal\u201d for the purposes of \u201cparty politics\u201d. He says it is reasonable for people to expect the UK to leave the EU with a deal, but calls for the people to have a vote to decide the best way forward. In response, Tory MP Andrew Selous says parliament is very good at saying no, but \u201cbereft of ideas to come up with anything better\u201d and calls on the result of the referendum to be respected by a new parliament that will \u201cactually vote for something for a change\u201d. Labour MP Sir George Howarth then asks why the prime minister is putting his own ambitions above the national interest. \u201cCometh the hour, cometh the man. Well, the hour has come, but certainly not the man,\u201d he says. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson commends Amber Rudd\u2019s brave decision in resigning from the cabinet \u2013 in what could be interpreted as the extension of an olive branch to the former work and pensions secretary. She goes on to tell Boris Johnson that people across the UK are afraid of a no-deal Brexit. Labour &amp; Co-operative MP Geraint Davies says that rather than spend millions on propaganda, the government should disclose Yellowhammer and use the money to help educate people about the horrors of the report. Questioned about her party\u2019s earlier announcement, Swinson says: \u201cIf people really want an end to this Brexit mire, the way to do that is to stop Brexit \u2026 A Liberal Democrat government would revoke article 50.\u201d She says elections should not be held at moments of national crisis. Although I believe that a People\u2019s Vote is the best way to resolve this, I say to the prime minister, he can have his general election as soon as he secures an extension, because otherwise we risk the scenario where there is a general election where we crash out of the European Union either during or in the immediate aftermath of such an election, and with parliament not sitting at those crucial moments, it would be the height of irresponsibility to dissolve parliament at that time. Former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan says the government has been \u201ctrammelled into a Kafkaesque trap\u201d by the Fixed Term Parliaments Act and that he hopes the next government will act swiftly to abolish it. He says that leaving the EU has been the most \u201cpoisonous, difficult decision of our life\u201d and predicts that a general election \u2013 called with Brexit unresolved \u2013 would not resolve the problems the government faces either. Blackford says Johnson has lost the support of Scottish Tories, referencing the resignation of former leader Ruth Davidson. \u201cWe want an election,\u201d he declares. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want it on the prime minister\u2019s terms. This is a prime minister who cannot be trusted, who is seeking to trap parliament tonight so he can drive us off the cliff edge.\u201d Bill Grant, one of 13 Tory MP\u2019s in Scotland intervenes to say that in 2016 more people in Scotland voted to leave the EU than voted for the SNP in 2017. Blackford says the SNP has won the last three elections, before going on to warn that the prime minister is set to demonstrate that the law \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d. The prime minister is saying with those words that he\u2019s going to ignore an act of parliament. That he is going to ignore the law. I would simply say to the Prime Minister: be careful. You occupy the highest office in the land and what you\u2019re demonstrating to the people of the United Kingdom is that the law doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s a very serious situation to be in. I ask the prime minister to think again, to think very carefully or be prepared to pay the consequences of ignoring the law of this land. SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford says he is ashamed at what he has seen in parliament this evening and calls on MPs to behave in a dignified manner. However, DUP MP Ian Paisley claims that an SNP MP shouted \u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u201d when Boris Johnson was speaking, and also alleges that a Labour member shouted \u201cYou\u2019re a thug\u201d at the prime minister. Blackford says he is condemning all such behaviour, and fellow SNP MP Stewart McDonald intervenes to compare the prorogation of parliament to events typical of a \u201cfailed state\u201d that Tory MPs would denounce. Johnson tells Corbyn to go to Brussels and negotiate a deal for himself, as the back and forth goes on, and the Labour leader retorts that his party is responsible and accuses the government of suspending parliament to avoid scrutiny. In particularly fraught proceedings \u2013 with Tory MP Robert Goodwill at one point standing up and flapping his arms like a chicken as some of his colleagues shouted chicken \u2013 Corbyn declares that the prime minister is talking up no-deal to one wing of his party and talking up getting a deal to the other. \u201cThe sad reality is that he is not preparing adequately for the first and not negotiating at all for the other,\u201d he says. \u201cThis government is only interesting in shutting down parliament to avoid scrutiny. His obfuscations and evasions are being rumbled, both at home and abroad.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to walk into traps set by this government.\u201d Corbyn says he wants to \u201cturf out this government\u201d, sparking jovial scenes on Tory benches, before claiming the government is \u201cscapegoating migrants\u201d and deepening divisions. He criticises Boris Johnson\u2019s social media output and then asks why, if the PM seeks a no deal, he does not argue for one and seek a mandate for it. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas has an apology for anyone watching proceedings in parliament. Jeremy Corbyn is called to address the question of whether there should be an early general election. \u201cThe only point of any importance the prime minister\u2019s just included in his speech is his clear indication that he does not intend to follow the law that has just been passed that requires him to ask for an extension in certain circumstances,\u201d he says. Corbyn declares he will not vote to support the dissolution of parliament until no-deal is taken off the table. \u201cI am not prepared to risk the disaster of inflicting no deal on us, our communities, our jobs, our services, or indeed, our rights,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cNo deal would not be a clear break \u2026 It would start a whole new period of confusion and delay. But this time, set against a backdrop of rising unemployment, further deindustrialisation and deepening poverty all across this country.\u201d The Speaker dismisses \u201cpolitical\u201d interventions from several MP\u2019s, including Sarah Wollaston, who asks whether the prime minister will appear in committee as scheduled on Wednesday. Boris Johnson warns MPs that they are \u201cthwarting the will of the people\u201d and calls again for a general election. Johnson throws down the gauntlet to opposition MPs and reasserts that he would leave the EU without a deal. If you really want to delay Brexit beyond October the 31st, which is what you seem to want to do, then vote for an election and let the people decide if they want a delay or not. And if you refuse to do that tonight, I will go to Brussels and negotiate our departure, hopefully with a deal, but without one if necessary. I will not ask for another delay. The Tory benches are raucous as Johnson moves the microphone closer to himself, until Anna Soubry brings a point of order and urges him to confirm whether he will respect the wishes of parliament. Johnson thanks Bercow for his \u201ccharacteristically impartial judgements\u201d and goes on to obfuscate by criticising Corbyn for receiving a salary and highlighting inconsistencies in Labour\u2019s Brexit policy positions. Johnson criticises the Liberal Democrats over their plans to cancel Brexit. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats also called for a referendum on our membership to the EU and once they got it - and by the way they lost it, of course - they did nothing but try to overturn the result,\u201d he says. \u201cArrogating to themselves to decide which democratic decisions they respect and those they reject. They want a second referendum and they are already planning to campaign against the result. When asked if she would implement Brexit if the people voted for it the party\u2019s new leader replied \u2018No\u2019.\u201d However, he describes the party as a model of \u201ccoherence by comparison with the leader of the opposition\u201d and claims that Labour do not want an election because they fear they will lose. But he says there are a small minority of Labour MPs who also don\u2019t want a general election because they think the party might win. In front of a packed front bench, Johnson says \u201cDither, delay and procrastination\u201d have become \u201cthe hallmark of the opposition\u201d and proclaims he would win an election. He gives way to Labour MP Marsha de Cordova who says nine years of austerity has led to the degradation of the education system and the NHS, as well as four million children living in poverty. Johnson suggests, in more colourful terms, that the money spent on EU membership would help fund public services. Enter the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who thanks for the Speaker for his long and distinguished service, and puts forward the motion to bring an early election. He then mockingly praises Jeremy Corbyn for declining the \u201copportunity\u201d to remove the government. \u201cLast Wednesday [Jeremy Corbyn] became the first leader of the opposition in the history of our country to show his confidence in Her Majesty\u2019s Government by declining the opportunity to have an election with a view to removing the Government.\u201d He says Corbyn previously said he would back an election if legislation to prevent the Government from forcing through a no-deal Brexit on October 31 became law. The surrender act has now passed, it\u2019s gained royal assent, he\u2019s done his level best to wreck this country\u2019s chances of a successful negotiation. By his own logic, he must now back an election. Throughout the weekend [Corbyn\u2019s] cronies, together with those of other opposition parties, have been trying to disguise their preposterous cowardice by coming up with ever more outrageous excuses for delaying an election until the end of October or perhaps November or when hell freezes over. The parliamentary buildings bill motion passes without a division, and Labour MP Stephen Doughty says he has been made aware that the government is \u201cseeking to circumvent the terms of the resolution that the house passed earlier about the release of documents relating to prorogation and Operation Yellowhammer\u201d. He asks whether the Speaker can advise on the method through which the papers can be disclosed. John Bercow criticises an MP who he says shouted \u201cYawn\u201d as Doughty was speaking and says the government must comply with the wishes of the house. Its not \u2018Yawn\u2019, its serious politics. The simple answer is that the government must comply with the Humble Address passed by the House. That is the reality of the matter. A debate has happened, a decision has been made, and it is incumbent upon the government to comply manifestly with what\u2019s been decided, the spirit, purposes and content of which are entirely clear. This not about game-playing and machination, it\u2019s about doing what parliament wants, which is what most people would expect their elected parliament to do. Today\u2019s sketch from the Guardian\u2019s John Crace, as we await the early election debate while MPs discuss Lords amendments to the parliamentary renovation plans. The Liberal Democrats are set to officially back revoking article 50 in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party. Guardian political correspondent Kate Proctor reports that the move would effectively sever the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election. \u201cI relish the chance to take the fight to Boris Johnson in an election and I\u2019m confident we\u2019d make significant gains,\u201d says party leader Jo Swinson. \u201cWhenever the election comes, our position is clear and unequivocal. A majority Liberal Democrat government would not renegotiate Brexit, we would cancel it by revoking article 50 and remaining in the European Union.\u201d In the Commons, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds says that his party is \u201cfully committed\u201d to restoring devolved powers in Stormont. He alludes to a number of the party\u2019s controversial positions, including on keeping abortion illegal, and says the DUP would deal with the important issues Northern Ireland faces \u201cwithout prejudice to the issues that Sinn F\u00e9in have elevated\u201d. Dodds claims that Sinn F\u00e9in is \u201cpreventing the restoration of Stormont\u201d upon the basis of these issues. Former Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins is to join investment bank Goldman Sachs, according to the FT. The paper reports that he will not earn an elite-rank wage, but will receive a six-figure sum just below the managing director level, where salaries start at \u00a3770,000. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg tweets that the government is expected to disclose the Brexit documents tomorrow. There are reports that Phil Hogan, Ireland\u2019s European commission nominee, is to be confirmed as the EU\u2019s chief trade negotiator. The Irish politician has been critical of Boris Johnson and warned last month of the ramifications of a no-deal Brexit on the relationship between the UK and EU states. \u201cIf the UK fails to prevent a crash-out Brexit they should be under no illusion regarding the foul atmosphere they will create with their EU partners and the serious consequences this will have for negotiating any future trade agreement,\u201d he said, according to the Irish Times. The BBC has posted this remarkable video of opposition MPs arguing earlier. A number of other MP\u2019s, including the chancellor Sajid Javid, has since reposted the exchange. In the Commons, MPs are now debating the motion relating to the executive in Northern Ireland moved by Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith in Theresa May\u2019s former chief whip\u2019s first appearance at the dispatch box. However, he says that there is not enough time to debate all the motions on the order paper. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two years but Smith says he believes the parties could swiftly agree a programme for government despite fundamental disagreements. Political parties across the spectrum must now realise that the lack of political leadership has left public servants bearing the load for far too long .. There can be no more excuses. We just have to get this assembly and executive up and running .. The government will now intensify its efforts to put forward compromise solutions to the parties. The Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported earlier (see 4.26pm) that there were rumours Boris Johnson was considering putting forward a Northern Ireland-only backstop to get a Brexit deal through parliament in the second half of October. As Daniel Boffey reported on Friday, it is understood the UK has suggested there is a need for Stormont to be able to vote on the continuation of the proposed common regulatory area, which has been described by EU officials as a \u201cbackstop-lite\u201d. BBC political editor Nick Robinson sums up how the government has fared of late. The Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee writes that MPs should do away with \u201cCorbynphobia\u201d to prevent a no deal. It\u2019s no use wishing for another leader of the opposition; this is the one Labour has, and in this crisis he is now stepping up to the plate. His leadership of the alliance has been \u201ccollegiate\u201d; he is the grownup, while Johnson breaks things. Theresa May lost her 20-point lead in the 2017 election; Johnson\u2019s lead in the polls is about half that. Corbyn\u2019s manifesto back then was highly popular and you can bet it will sell well again. He\u2019s a good campaigner; Johnson may disappoint. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn closes the debate and says his party would support an early general election once \u201cthe government had made clear they will carry out the law\u201d, asking it to extend the Brexit deadline to prevent no deal. \u201cSurely, Mr Speaker, the very least we deserve from the prime minister is a clear undertaking that a requirement that we ask for an extension until January to prevent crashing out must be made at the appropriate time,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy can\u2019t the foreign secretary or the prime minister say that?\u201d After the government has made it clear that it will respect the law, Labour would be happy to debate any of the government\u2019s policies in a general election, Corbyn declares. And the motion passes without a division. Raab says the country wants \u201cthis mess sorted out\u201d by the end of October but that the House of Commons is seeking to further delay Brexit. \u201cIn those circumstances, the proper way to proceed is for this House to allow voters to decide in an election who goes over to negotiate at the European Council on the 17th of October, the prime minister, or the right honourable gentleman,\u201d he says, pointing at Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cBut what is [he] afraid of?\u201d In the absence of an election, Johnson will go to Brussels on that day to negotiate a departure from the EU \u201cwith or without a deal\u201d. \u201cI urge this house to vote today not for more deadlock and delay but the only course of action that will break this deadlock, restore public confidence in our democracy, and allow this country to move forwards,\u201d Raab says. Taking a sterner line as he goes on, Raab says Johnson is working on securing a deal but claims the country is appalled by repeated attempts in parliament \u201cto frustrate Brexit\u201d. Respecting the referendum must also mean that this house allows us to leave without a deal if Brussels leave no other credible choice. Taking that option off the table severely weakened our negotiating position. Winding up the debate, the foreign secretary \u2013 who first mooted the idea of proroguing parliament during the Tory election contest \u2013 pays tribute to what he describes as interesting points that have been made \u201cby all sides of the house\u201d and provides a careful account of the government\u2019s position. This government will always respect the rule of law. That\u2019s been our clear position consistently, and frankly it is outrageous that it is even in doubt. Of course, how the rule of law will be respected is normally straightforward. But sometimes it can be more complex because there are conflicting laws or competing legal advice. The government usually gets its interpretation right, but there have been many judicial reviews over the years by many governments of different complexions. When on occasion the government has lost a case \u2026 then of course it must correct its position accordingly and expeditiously. A number of backbench Tory MPs have been offering defences of the government position, and longtime Eurosceptic Peter Bone says the legislation designed to prevent no deal was \u201crushed through\u201d without \u201cproper scrutiny\u201d and that this debate is being held for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d. \u201cThis is a general debate which is being held for political purposes,\u201d he asserts. Tory MP for the Cotswolds Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown says it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d that the prime minister would break the law and claims the longer uncertainty over Brexit goes on, the more the public will hold parliament in contempt. \u201cThis parliament has passed a rotten law, it has asked the prime minister to seek an extension on terms that we know not what they were, are, might be,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could face all sorts of terms in that extension \u2026 Yet this parliament has mandated the prime minister to accept those terms whatever they are.\u201d Moments earlier, former Labour MP Ian Austin called into question the opposition party\u2019s credentials for government. \u201cThese people are a million miles away from the traditional, mainstream politics of the Labour party,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have poisoned what was once a great party with extremism. They cannot be trusted with the institutions that underpin our democracy.\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson says it is \u201castonishing\u201d that a debate over whether the prime minister will respect the rule of law is taking place. \u201cThe prime minister is on a power trip, but the truth is he does not have unfettered power much as he would like to,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of arrogance and entitlement about this action. He acts like rules and conventions simply do not apply to him.\u201d She concedes the law preventing no-deal is not perfect. \u201cIts a good step, but not a guarantee .. frankly I for one, will not put anything past our prime minister in terms of what he will try to engineer.\u201d Extremely strong words from the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford who says freedoms, rights and democracy are under threat and under attack by a prime minister \u201cthreatening to ignore the rule of law\u201d. Mr Speaker, today is indeed a historic day, a dark day, it will be remembered as the day the UK government obstructed the people and plunged the United Kingdom into an unprecedented constitutional crisis. The prime minister says he would rather die in a ditch than write to seek an extension to protect our economy from falling off the cliff edge, if that is the course he chooses then he must resign. Undermining democracy at every turn, [Johnson] simply cannot be trusted. The rule book has been well and truly ripped up, and with it democracy and decency shredded by a cult of Brexit fanboys in No 10 unfit and unwilling to govern. Mr Speaker, what a despicable state of affairs, that an unelected bureaucrat - the prime minister\u2019s lead advisor, is sitting in No 10 devising and directing an assault on democracy, preventing parliamentary scrutiny and transparency And should we be surprised, these are the men behind the biggest con in modern times. The government has responded to the passage of the vote earlier compelling the release of the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer document and No 10\u2019s private prorogation correspondence. Meanwhile, on Radio 4, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen says he believes that a Northern Ireland only backstop would only be acceptable if put to a vote in the nation. The most senior government minister currently in the chamber Dominic Raab, and former Tory MP Anna Soubry says that given the motion concerns the rule of law it would be surprising if the foreign secretary were to answer those questions. In fairness, Raab was a lawyer before becoming an MP. But the point still stands, and further questions are likely to be raised if a government law officer such as the secretary of state for justice, or the attorney general, do not address Corbyn\u2019s motion. Winding up his speech, Corbyn calls on Johnson to come to the dispatch box to set out \u201chis detailed plan for Brexit\u201d and confirm he will abide by the law. I hope the prime minister will live up to the office that he holds, accept the decisions made of the parliament and carry out the wishes of that Act to ensure that an application is made to prevent this country crashing out on the 31st of October with all the damage that will do to food supplies, medicine supplies, industrial supplies, and his longer term ambitions of heading this country in a totally different direction which many, many people are truly frightened of. Prominent Brexiteer and Tory backbencher Peter Bone asks whether Corbyn would support a no-deal if one of the other EU countries blocked the UK from extending article 50. The Labour leader dismisses the question as hypothetical and calls on the government to accept the decision of parliament to pass the act preventing no-deal into law \u2013 before predicting the vote calling for a general election later this evening will not pass. \u201cNo 10 has briefed that the PM will defy the law, so until the government has abided by that law, I don\u2019t believe there will be a majority in this house for what the PM is proposing later today under the Fixed-term Parliament Act. Asked again what would happen if an EU country did not grant an extension, Corbyn says: \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to get a deal but what we don\u2019t want is a no deal exit with all the dangers for jobs, living standards, supplies and the prime minister and his chums taking us down the road into the arms of Donald Trump and the trade arrangements he\u2019ll make with the US.\u201d He goes on to reference Amber Rudd\u2019s claims over the weekend that there was \u201cnot one shred of evidence\u201d that the government had made any new proposals during the Brexit negotiations. Former minister Angela Eagle intervenes to highlight the apparent contradiction between Boris Johnson saying he would obey the bill preventing a no-deal if it was passed, but the next day announcing he would rather be dead in a ditch. Corbyn says he does not wish anyone dead in the ditch, but that the PM should accept the democratic will of parliament. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an executive president who can rule over us .. We will expect the prime minister to abide by the details of the law.\u201d The SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, then says the government has a responsibility to recognise the impact of its abusive language and actions outside of parliament. Corbyn agrees that language has consequences: \u201cSurely we can have an intelligent debate in our society without resorting to that kind of behaviour, language or violence threatened against some individuals.\u201d Here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s motion, which is now being debated and may go through without a division. That this house welcomes the completion of all parliamentary stages of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill and has considered the matter of the importance of the rule of law and ministers obligation to comply with the law. Earlier (see 5.12pm), the Labour leader said MPs would be concerned by suggestions from No 10 that the prime minister may not obey this law. Opening his speech, Corbyn thanked the Speaker and welcomed the decision the house had just reached and said he looked forward to the government abiding by it. The fact that parliament is compelled to pass a law to ensure the will of parliament is upheld shows what extraordinary times we now live in. The house has rejected no deal, businesses and trade unions are united in rejecting no deal, and there is no majority for it across the country. The Chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster [Michael Gove], the co-convenor of the vote leave campaign, said in March this year \u2018we didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. It is clear there is no mandate for no deal. In trying to diminish the act, the government\u2019s spin doctors have branded it the surrender bill and ministers dutifully trotted out this phrase in the media and the minister who\u2019s going to reply has already replied like Pavlov\u2019s dogs always do. We are not at war. The prime minister is obsessed with this hyperbole and aggressive language. \u2018surrender bill\u2019, \u2018do or die\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019d rather be dead in a ditch\u2019, the list goes on. Mr Speaker, we\u2019re supposed to be having negotiations with our European partners. The lives at stake as a result of all of this, are not those of the prime minister or his cabinet. He went on to criticise Boris Johnson\u2019s absence from the House of Commons, amid cries of \u201cwhere is he\u201d. Following the conclusion of this 90-minute debate, MP\u2019s will debate a motion under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act and Lords amendments to the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill. Then, at around 10pm, MPs will debate Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election over the course of an hour and a half, before a vote which will take 15 minutes. Parliament will then prorogue. That was Boris Johnson\u2019s fourth main defeat in a Commons vote since he became prime minister. The other defeats were: on the Oliver Letwin motion allowing time for the Benn bill, on the Benn bill at second and third reading and on holding an early election. The final vote counted as a defeat, because Johnson did not get the required two-thirds majority, although technically he won, because more MPs voted in favour than against. But what does this defeat mean? Humble addresses are considered binding on the government. The passing of this motion (see 7.24pm) means the government is now obliged to release to the Commons: 1) all private messages sent between nine advisers, including Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s de facto chief of staff, including text and WhatsApp messages and private emails, sent from 23 July relating to the prorogation of parliament. 2) all the documents prepared within government since 23 July 2019 relating to operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee. The motion mentions 23 July because that is the day Boris Johnson became Tory leader. He become prime minister the following day. The material is meant to be handed over by 11 September. However, it does not seem likely that the government will comply. The Commons will not even be sitting on Wednesday. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs that he wanted to publish some version of the Operation Yellowhammer document anyway. But during the debate Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, suggested that the government would not have the legal power to enforce the release of the internal prorogation messages, even if it wanted to comply. (See 5.51pm.) Last year Labour used the humble address mechanism to require the publication of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice about the withdrawal agreement. The government initially ignored the request, and it only complied a month later when MPs passed another motion finding the government in contempt of parliament. In this case no such contempt motion will be passed any time soon, because after tonight the Commons will not be sitting until 14 October. And even if it were passed, a contempt motion on its own would not necessarily force Boris Johnson\u2019s government to comply. Theresa May\u2019s government did, but May respected the authority of parliament. Johnson\u2019s administration seems much more contemptuous of it. On other issues MPs and campaigners have threatened legal action, or gone to court, to ensure that Johnson complies with their wishes. But this vote is not a matter of legislation, and it does not relate to the exercise of prerogative powers. It is a Commons procedural matter, and so it is hard to see on what basis the courts could intervene. That\u2019s all from me for the night. My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over. MPs have backed the Grieve motion requiring the release of some no-deal planning documents, and private messages from No 10 officials about prorogation, by 311 votes to 302 \u2013 a majority of nine. Here is the text of Dominic Grieve\u2019s motion. That a humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to direct ministers to lay before this House, not later than 11.00pm Wednesday 11 September, all correspondence and other communications (whether formal or informal, in both written and electronic form, including but not limited to messaging services including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Facebook messenger, private email accounts both encrypted and unencrypted, text messaging and iMessage and the use of both official and personal mobile phones) to, from or within the present administration, since 23 July 2019 relating to the prorogation of Parliament sent or received by one or more of the following individuals: Hugh Bennett, Simon Burton, Dominic Cummings, Nikki da Costa, Tom Irven, Sir Roy Stone, Christopher James, Lee Cain or Beatrice Timpson; and that ministers be further directed to lay before this House no later than 11.00pm Wednesday 11 September all the documents prepared within Her Majesty\u2019s government since 23 July 2019 relating to operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee. MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s SO24 motion. Dominic Grieve intervenes. He asks Gove to explain why no government official swore an affidavit for the prorogation court case? Gove says the question for MPs is, are they willing to ignore data protection legislation, the ECHR and the normal conventions of government, just so that Grieve\u2019s curiosity can be satisfied. John Bercow, the Speaker, intervenes and calls the vote. Gove says he has already said that the government intends to plan a version of the Operation Yellowhammer report on no-deal planning. But it is neither an impact assessment or a worst-case scenario, he says. Gove says the Grieve motion is unprecedented. It is a fishing expedition, he says. He says it drives a coach and horses through privacy regulation. And he says it may be in breach of article eight of the European convention on human rights on privacy. He suggests this is an unprecedented example of people who claim to respect conventions undermining them. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is now winding up for the government. He says documentation about how the government decided to prorogue parliament is already in the public domain, because of the court cases that have been taking place. He says it rare for such information to be in the public domain. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from Northern Ireland, says Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, made it clear last week that he was not consulted about the decision to prorogue parliament. He says submissions sent to the PM do not normally go to the whole of the cabinet. He says the government is now being asked to submit every idea on this submitted by officials to the PM. But there has to be a \u201csafe space\u201d where advice can be private, he says. He says Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, told a committee earlier today that if this motion were passed, it would have a chilling effect on the advice given to ministers. He says that four of the people named in the motion are civil servants, not just one as Dominic Grieve said earlier. These are from Lindsay Hoyle, the most senior of the three deputy speakers and one of the favourites to replace John Bercow as Speaker. Boris Johnson was due to give evidence to the Commons liaison committee, which represents all select committee chairs, on Wednesday. It would have been his first appearance before the committee, which questions prime ministers three times a year, for about 90 minutes at a time. But the decision to prorogue parliament means the committee hearing will not go ahead because Commons committees do not formally meet during prorogation. But Sarah Wollaston, the committee\u2019s chair, has written to Johnson asking him to agree to meet them anyway, as he originally said he would. It would not be an official committee hearing, but there is nothing to stop MPs agreeing to hold a meeting at any time they want. If prorogation meant the committee could not use a Commons committee room for the hearing, doubtless the BBC or Sky would be more than happy to host the hearing. (Or the Guardian - we\u2019ll find you a room and a video feed.) Owen Paterson, a Tory Brexiter, is speaking now. He says the motion names nine \u201crelatively junior\u201d people. He says it is unfair that they are being asked to disclose their private communications. I just think before this witch hunt atmosphere continues, would members opposite like to consider they are talking about nine relatively junior members assisting the government. Can we just think of the impact on them that their private emails, their private phone to their family and friends, are all going to be inspected. And who is the omniscient person, this great found wisdom, on who will judge whether those messages are pertinent to this motion? (The list includes Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff. No one thinks he is relatively junior.) Cherry speculates that people in government may have discussed the real reason for prorogation not in official emails, which would be subject to disclosure rules, but in private messages or using burner phones. She says that is why the motion (see 5.35pm) asks for the release of private messages relating to the prorogation of parliament. If they have done nothing wrong, they have nothing to fear, she says. She says she knows enough about English history to know that two kings, Edward II and Richard II, were brought down by \u201cunaccountable whispers of poison\u201d. This motion could reveal other \u201cunaccountable whispers of poison\u201d, she suggests. Cherry refers MPs to this article by the legal commentator David Allen Green in the Financial Times (paywall) at the weekend. She says the court case revolved around the government\u2019s motives for proroguing parliament - the matter of \u201cbad faith\u201d. She says that in litigation like this, faced with an allegation of bad faith, the normal response of a respondent would be to provide a witness statement. But in this case the government did not do that, he says \u2013 a point made by Green. Here is an extract from Green\u2019s article. Could it be that a witness statement was intended and prepared but that the relevant senior officials refused to sign it? Or that the document contained something the government did not want the court, or the world, to know? Ms Cherry asked Michael Gove, the minister responsible for no-deal planning, about it. He said he had \u201cabsolutely no idea\u201d. Witness statements are formal court documents, and it is a criminal offence to sign one that you know to be incorrect. They are serious documents for serious people, as far apart from the trivial discourse of political sloganeering and promises as one can imagine. Witness statements matter. The government\u2019s position on prorogation is that the request was made for routine reasons, and not to frustrate parliament. The legal challengers in London say there is evidence that ministers themselves do not quite believe it. But that is the official version. The government has disclosed some documents which, on their face, show that the prorogation was routine but Ms Cherry and others fear that these do not provide a full account, and that the decision was contained in unofficial communications, such as WhatsApp messages. My own view is that if the government\u2019s disclosed documents were the entire story then a witness statement would not have been a problem. Cherry says if the courts decide the prorogation was unlawful, they can order parliament to return. In the Commons Joanna Cherry, the SNP justice and home affairs spokeswoman, is speaking now. She is one of the MPs backing the legal challenge in Scotland against the decision to prorogue parliament. She says even the \u201cdogs in the street\u201d know the real reason for prorogation was to do with the desire to try to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. She says as late as 25 August No 10 was denying that it planned to prorogue parliament, even though the decision to prorogue was taken earlier. She says the government has a reputation for being economical with the truth. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, used his speech in the debate to say Labour would be backing the Grieve motion. He said that in recent weeks there had been a growing lack of trust in the government among MPs. Here is the key quote from Dominic Grieve. In his speech opening the debate, he referred to the government\u2019s claim that the five-week prorogation was not related to its desire to limit the opportunity for MPs to obstruct a no-deal Brexit. Ministers claimed that that was not a factor, and that the length of the prorogation was just to do with the need to prepare for the Queen\u2019s speech. But, Grieve said, when the government was taken to court, there were claims that that government lawyers could not find any officials willing to swear an affidavit backing up the government\u2019s case. He continued: Then a most remarkable thing happened, and this is where it becomes more difficult for me. I have to say that in the course of the days that followed, I started to be given information from public officials informing me that they believed that the handling of this matters smacked of scandal. There\u2019s no other way to describe it. Of course, that places me in a difficulty because it is simply the information that I\u2019ve been given, and I want to make absolutely clear that I\u2019m not in a position any more than I think any member in this house to be able to ascertain if that information is mistaken or not. I can only say that I believe those sources to be reliable and also in my experience extraordinarily unusual that I should get such approaches with individuals expressing their disquiet about the handling of this matter and some of the underlying issues to which it could give rise. So it is as a consequence of that that I have drafted \u2026 the humble address concerning the prorogation documents. Grieve said one of the nine officials named in his motion was a civil servant, but all the rest were special advisers (political appointees). He said he had named them because they might have information that would shed light on what happened. But he stressed that the decision to name these people did not mean he was making any \u201cimputation\u201d against them. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, intervenes again. He says this motion would be binding on the government. But it would not be binding on individuals. He says he thinks, in what he is saying, Grieve is narrowing the information that he wants to request. Grieve does not accept this. He says advisers should be willing to provide the information requested in this motion, if MPs vote for it. If they are not willing to do that, that would amount to a \u201cslide towards a government that will not respect the conventions without which orderly government in this country cannot take place\u201d. Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan intervenes. He says Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff, asked a special adviser to hand over her personal mobile phone for inspection before he sacked her. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, intervenes. He asks what legal right the government has to require its employees to give up its personal email accounts and private messages. Grieve says these are government employees. During the course of their work they have to comply with the civil service code, including not using private email addresses to carry out official work. He says, in addition to that, it is a question of what the Commons requests. He says he understands this house could act abusively. But he says, if any government employee is asked to look and see if a communication has been carried out relevant to work, you should be willing to provide it. That should not be a matter of coercion, he says. Geoffrey Cox suggests No 10 could not force staff to comply with Grieve\u2019s motion. In the Commons Chris Leslie, the Independent Group for Change MP, intervenes on Dominic Grieve to quote from a Mail Online story quoting a No 10 source saying that even if the motion is passed Downing Street will not comply. He says that is the problem. NNo 10 is quoted saying things like this that ignore all conventional rules. He says it is impossible to know where these comments come from. Grieve says, when questions about this were asked at PMQs, Boris Johnson refused to engage with the questions. He says he does not trust Johnson to provide answers on this. Dominic Grieve is opening the debate on his standing order 24 motion that would force the publication of the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer document and No 10\u2019s private prorogation correspondence. Here is the text of the motion. He started by saying how concerned he was by government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks. Referring to Boris Johnson\u2019s comment about how the September sitting was something introduced by the \u201cgirly swot\u201d David Cameron, he says he guessed Johnson mentioned this as a contrast with his own \u201cmanly idleness\u201d. Grieve also says, after the announcement came out, he was contacted by people claiming that the decision amounted to a scandal. He says the government claimed that the long prorogation had nothing to do with limiting the opportunities for MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit, but that in fact that may be untrue. He says his motion requires the publication of private messages relating to prorogation sent by nine named officials, from 23 July. The nine officials are named in his motion. He says that the fact that people have been named should not be seen as an allegation of wrongdoing. From now until 7.15pm: MPs debate the Grieve SO24 motion saying the government should publish its Operation Yellowhammer documents and correspondence about proroguing parliament. At 7.15pm there will be a vote taking about 15 minutes. 7.30pm: MPs will debate Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s motion for 90 minutes. It may go through at the end without a division. Around 9pm: MPs will debate a motion under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act and Lords amendments to the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill. In theory, up to two and a half hours has been set aside for these matters, but they are likely to wrap up much sooner \u2013 perhaps in about an hour. Around 10pm: MPs begin the 90-minute debate on Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election. When it finishes there will be a vote, which will take about 15 minutes. After that parliament will prorogue. John Bercow says he will allow the Corbyn application for an emergency debate too. He says the debate will start after the Grieve SO24 one. It will last for up to 90 minutes, he says. Jeremy Corbyn says he wants an urgent debate on a matter of overriding importance on this motion: That this house welcomes the completion of all parliamentary stages of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill and has considered the matter of the importance of the rule of law and ministers obligation to comply with the law. He says MPs will be concerned by suggestions from No 10 that the prime minister may not obey this law. Bercow says that debate will start now, and that it will last for two hours. But first he is hearing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s application for another SO24 debate. Dominic Grieve is now making his application for a standing order 24 debate. Here is the motion he is proposing. Grieve says MPs will now have the chance to ask about Operation Yellowhammer because of the prorogation, and also have a chance to ask about the government\u2019s motives for proroguing parliament for five weeks. He says his motion would enable MPs to get these documents before Brexit. He says, if the motion is agreed, he will explain in the debate why these documents are required. John Bercow allows the motion. Some MPs shout now, but at least 40 MPs (the number required) stand up, meaning it will go ahead. Parliament should be debating the \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences of a no-deal Brexit that could put lives at risk, instead of being suspended, the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Speaking ahead of a \u201cNo to no deal\u201d rally in Glasgow this evening. Brown said: Boris Johnson and his ministers say that Britain is taking back control. But in reality, Britain is losing control \u2013 of our food supplies, of our medical supplies and of our manufacturing supplies \u2026 Can the prime minister guarantee that medical supplies \u2013 the 1m medical packs that come every day into the country through ports such as Dover \u2013 arrive uninterrupted and without putting lives at risk? Can he pledge that our food supplies \u2013 30% of which come from mainland Europe and another 10% through countries where Europe has trade agreements \u2013 will arrive uninterrupted without putting nutritional standards at risk and pushing food prices up 10%? Brown said without these assurance, Brexit would be \u201cthe biggest own goal in our peacetime economic history \u2026 no matter how much it is dressed up as a patriotic act\u201d. These are from the Institute for Government\u2019s Hannah White. More on the backstop. This is from the Financial Times\u2019s George Parker. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is pleased about John Bercow\u2019s departure. This is what my colleague Rajeev Syal wrote earlier this year about the candidates to be next Speaker. Here is video of John Bercow\u2019s resignation statement. The Labour MP Jim Cunningham has also announced he is standing down at the next election, the BBC\u2019s Simon Gilbert reports. In the Commons the Bercow leaving do tributes are still rolling on. For a different take, this from the Times\u2019 Esther Webber. This is from PA Media. A new law designed to stop the government forcing through a no-deal has reached the statute book. The granting of royal assent for the legislation was announced by the Lord Speaker in the House of Lords, ahead of the suspension or prorogation of parliament. The new act requires a delay to Brexit beyond 31 October unless a divorce deal is approved or parliament agrees to leaving the EU without one by 19 October. Boris Johnson has previously branded it the \u201csurrender bill\u201d, claiming it took away control of the UK\u2019s negotiations with the EU by allowing parliament to block no deal. Downing Street has said the government will obey the law, but repeated that the PM would not be seeking a further extension to the article 50 withdrawal process. In the Commons chamber the tributes to John Bercow are still coming. But not everyone is joining in. This is from the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young. One theory doing the rounds in Dublin is that Boris Johnson may pull a Northern Ireland-only backstop out of the bag at the last minute as a means of forcing a Brexit deal through parliament in between 17 October and 31 October. The idea was mooted early on in Brexit talks but famously dropped after opposition from the DUP, which accused Theresa May of trying to break up the union of the United Kingdom by creating regulatory checks down the Irish Sea. But Johnson\u2019s proposal for an all-island agriculture zone is one of the key elements of the backstop and now that the DUP no longer has the leverage it had because of the changed arithmetic, some believe this is where the landing zone is. As Daniel Boffey reported on Friday, it is understood the UK has suggested there is a need for Stormont to be able to vote on the continuation of the proposed common regulatory area, which has been described by EU officials as a \u201cbackstop-lite\u201d. The suggestion that Stormont could have a role in dynamic regulatory alignment has been rejected by the EU, but it is being seen as a sign of the thinking in Conservative quarters. It may also explain why efforts are being redoubled to get Stormont back up and running by the deadline for direct rule in October. One British source said the all-island agri-zone \u201cis a very serious proposal\u201d and should not be dismissed, with another reporting one senior cabinet minister dropping strong hints that a Northern Ireland-only backstop is not off the table, despite statements to the contrary by Boris Johnson. So is it possible that Johnson comes back from Brussels on 17 October with no deal, and, faced with the law that will require him to seek an extension, reverts to the original Northern Ireland-only backstop in a very last die-in-a-ditch moment? A few months ago we posted this video with some highlights from John Bercow\u2019s time as Speaker. These are from the House magazine\u2019s Seb Whale. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From my colleague Patrick Wintour The tributes to John Bercow are still coming in. They have included tributes from Dame Cheryl Gillan, who praised Bercow for the support he has given to those who have campaigned on behalf of those with autism, from Angela Eagle, who praised his campaigning on behalf of LGBT issues, and from Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, who said that even though he disagreed with some of Bercow\u2019s rulings, he thought Bercow had been an \u201coutstanding\u201d Speaker. Bercow told Bone it was big of him to say that in the light of their Brexit disagreements. Here is the full text of John Bercow\u2019s resignation statement. Colleagues, I would like to make a personal statement to the house. At the 2017 election I promised my wife and children that it would be my last. This is a pledge that I intend to keep. If the house votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as Speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends. If the house does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me stand down at the close of business on Thursday, 31 October. Least disruptive because that date will fall shortly after the votes on the Queen\u2019s speech expected on 21 and 22 October. The week also after that may be quite lively and it would be best to have an experienced figure in the chair for that short period. Most democratic because it will mean that a ballot is held when all members have some knowledge of the candidates. This is far preferable to a contest at the beginning of a parliament when new MPs will not be similarly informed and may find themselves vulnerable to undue institutional influence. We would not want anyone to be whipped senseless, would we? Throughout my time as Speaker I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature for which I will make absolutely no apology to anyone, anywhere, at any time. To deploy a perhaps dangerous phrase, I have also sought to be the backbencher\u2019s backstop. I could not do so without the support of a small but superb team in Speaker\u2019s House, the wider house staff, my Buckingham constituents, and above all my wife, Sally, and our three children, Oliver, Freddy and Jemima. From the bottom of my heart, I thank them all profusely. I could also not have served without the repeated support of this house and its members past and present. This is a wonderful place filled overwhelmingly by people who are motivated by their notion of the national interest by their perception of the public good. And by their duty, not as delegates, but as representatives, to do what they believe is right for our country. We degrade this parliament at our peril. I have served as a member of parliament for 22 years, and for the last 10 as Speaker. This has been, let me put it explicitly, the greatest privilege and honour of my professional life for which I will be eternally grateful. I wish my successor in the chair the very best fortune in standing up for the rights of honourable and right honourable members individually and for parliament institutionally as the Speaker of the House of Commons. It is important to remember, of course, that only yesterday the Conservatives announced that they were going to field a candidate against John Bercow at the next election, even though the Speaker is normally given a clear run, because they had concluded he was biased against them on Brexit. The story is here. A few minutes ago Michael Gove praised Bercow lavishly. (See 3.51pm.) Maybe he was being sincere if speaking in a personal capacity (Gove is an accomplished parliamentarian debater, and did not seem to mind Bercow giving backbenchers the chance to hold the executive to account), but for a Conservative party and government representative to be praising Bercow a day after launching a plan to unseat him, and on the day the government is closing parliament to stop ministers being held to account, was astonishingly hypocritical. David Lidington, the former Cabinet Office minister, represents the constituency next door to Bercow\u2019s in Buckinghamshire. He says Bercow never allowed his duties as Speaker to detract from his need to represent his constituents. Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit committee, whose bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was passed as a result of a procedural ruling allowed by Bercow, praises Bercow as a reforming Speaker who has empowered parliament. Bercow says Gove never complained about urgent questions being granted at short notice, because he was always quick enough and bright enough to respond. He suggests that praising Gove may not do him credit on the Tory benches. (Many Tory MPs loath Bercow, and will be glad to see him gone.) Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is speaking now. He says for the first time he would like to associate himself with what Jeremy Corbyn said. He says Bercow was a tenacious backbencher, and frontbencher too. He says he has no wish to prematurely truncate Bercow\u2019 role in the chair. He says he has always appreciated the way Bercow has tried to ensure the executive has been held to account. He says Bercow has acted in the best tradition of Speakers. He says Bercow has tried to make the executive answerable to the Commons, just as the house is answerable to the people. He ends by saying he and Bercow have children at the same school. Jeremy Corbyn rises on a point of order and uses it to thank John Bercow for his work as Speaker. He says Bercow has \u201ctotally changed the way in which the job has been done\u201d. He has gone out to the country and spoken at schools and factories. He says he will always remember Bercow speaking to students with learning disabilities at an event in Corbyn\u2019s constituency. He says he has made the role of Speaker more powerful. Corbyn says, as someone who aspires to hold executive office, he approves of a powerful parliament holding the executive to account. He says he has tried to do that himself during his career. Bercow says he could not have served without the support of the Commons. He says it is filled with people motivated by their sense of public duty, and with people who see themselves not as delegates but as representatives \u2013 there to do what is best for the public. He says he has been an MP for 22 years, and Speaker for 10 years. It has been the greatest honour of his life, he says. He wishes his successor all the best in terms of standing up for the rights of MPs individually, and for parliament institutionally. Bercow has finished. He receives a round of applause, although with most of the clapping coming from the opposition benches. Bercow says he has always sought to be the champion of backbenchers. If you like, he has been their backstop, he says. He thanks House of Commons staff. And he thanks his wife and his three children. He sounds very emotional at this point. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he wants to make a personal statement. At the 2017 election he promised his wife and children that it would be his last, he says. He says if the Commons votes for an early general election, his tenure as Speaker and as an MP will end when this parliament ends. He says, if MPs do not vote for an election, he has concluded the least disruptiveoption will be to stand down at close of play on Thursday 31 October. He says the votes on the Queen\u2019s speech will come at the start of that week. He says it would make sense to have an experienced Speaker in the chair for those votes. And he says this would be the most democratic option because it would allow the new Speaker to be elected by MPs who know the candidates. From the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy Tory MPs are falling like skittles at the moment. Another, Mark Prisk, has announced that he is standing down at the next election. Prisk, 57, a former minister, voted remain in 2016 and voted with the government in the divisions on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. In his letter announcing his decision he says it is not a reaction to Brexit. But he also deprecates \u201cthe rise of narrow ideology over pragmatic, common sense\u201d, and so it is not hard to guess what he thinks of what Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are doing to the Conservative party. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has put out this statement about Boris Johnson\u2019s meeting with Leo Varadkar in Dublin this morning. She said: I am encouraged by the prime minister\u2019s commitment to getting a sensible deal. I hope the discussions in Dublin lay the foundation for a way forward. We want the referendum result implemented. To do otherwise would be to damage democracy but we have never been champions of exiting the European Union without a deal. To secure a sensible deal which respects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom will require pragmatic discussions on all sides. The prime minister has already ruled out a Northern Ireland-only backstop because it would be anti-democratic, unconstitutional and would mean our core industries would be subject to EU rules without any means of changing them. We will continue to work with the government and will also use any discussions with the taoiseach to encourage efforts towards a sensible deal. Foster is right to say that Johnson has ruled out a Northern Ireland-only backstop. But he also told told Tory MPs during the leadership contest that he was not attracted to the idea of proroguing parliament, and look what happened to that pledge. Perhaps she has included that paragraph because she wants to hold him to his commitment not to have a Northern Ireland only arrangement. It is interesting that she is saying he has ruled out a Northern Ireland backstop on the grounds that it is undemocratic, when in fact that is his argument for ruling out the UK-wide backstop. The argument for ruling out a Northern Ireland only one is different; that it would lead to a regulatory border down the Irish Sea. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Here is the full text of Dominic Grieve\u2019s SO24 motion. (See 2.23pm.) The government intends to prorogue parliament this evening, but before MPs get sent away for their five-week recess, they have got a huge amount to get through. Here is the timetable for the rest of the day. I use the word \u201ctimetable\u201d provisionally, because at this point it is not at all clear how long everything will take. In theory, if everything took the maximum amount of time allocated, the Commons could still be sitting at 8am tomorrow morning. No one expects that to happen. But the final vote, on whether or not to have an early election, may come at around 11pm. Here is what we know. 2.30pm: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, takes questions. 3.30pm: Two MPs make applications for emergency debates under standing order 24. They are Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, and Jeremy Corbyn. Taking advantage of the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow SO24 motions to be used not just for neutral motions (ie, ones with no practical effect), Grieve has used the process to table a \u201chumble address\u201d that, if passed, forces the government to release written material. And he is asking for not just one batch of material, but two: all private correspondence relating to the decision to prorogue parliament, and the Operation Yellowhammer government no-deal planning documents. Corbyn\u2019s motion is about the rule of law, but I have not seen the text yet. The Speaker will have to decide whether to accept one or both motions. Given the level of anger in the Commons about the prorogation decision, it is quite likely both will be allowed. In theory each debate could last up to three hours, taking you to 10pm if both motions were to be put to a vote. But at Westminster today there is an assumption that MPs will get through the SO24 debate or debates more quickly. Early evening?: The government has tabled five motions under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. Up to 90 minutes is allocated for each debate, but it is understood that four of the motions will get pulled, and the other one is not expected to take the full 90 minutes. Early/mid evening?: MPs have to conclude the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill, which is returning from the Lords. Up to an hour has been set aside for this debate, but, again, it could wrap up more quickly than that. 9pm or later?: MPs begin the 90-minute debate on Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election. Johnson is expected to win the vote technically, because most MPs voting are expected to vote in favour, but lose the vote in practical terms, because under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two thirds of MPs (434) must vote in favour for the election election to happen. Around 11pm or later?: Parliament prorogues. This involves a ceremony taking place in the House of Lords, with MPs summoned to attend, as happens with the Queen\u2019s speech - only without the Queen. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, is suggesting Boris Johnson could be impeached if he ignores the law designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid\u2019s Wesminster leader, said this after the meeting of opposition leaders this morning. I am glad that as opposition parties, we are united in our belief that Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to undermine the rule of law must be stopped. If the prime minister refuses to seek an extension to the period under article 50, he will have broken the law \u2013 plain and simple \u2013 and he must be subject to legal repercussions. I told other opposition parties this morning that if he does break the law, we should be ready to impeach Boris Johnson \u2013 a procedure that he himself supported in 2004 when current Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price sought to impeach Tony Blair for lying. Saville Roberts did not mention the fact that Price\u2019s attempt to impeach Blair in 2004 got nowhere. As this Commons library briefing (pdf) explains, \u201cimpeachment is considered obsolete, as it has been superseded by other forms of accountability\u201d. Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions, has suggested Johnson could be jailed for contempt of court if he ignored this law. This is what Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said after the meeting of opposition parties this morning. It is clear there must be an early election - but it cannot happen while the Tory government is threatening to subvert the law to force through a catastrophic no-deal Brexit on 31 October. If Boris Johnson wants an election he must obey the law and take a no-deal Brexit off the table. It is beyond belief that the prime minister is disrespecting democracy by seeking to shut down parliament and railroad through an extreme Brexit against the will of parliament and the people. Once the threat of no deal is off the table, we will move for an early election. The government has spent tens of thousands of pounds in recent days on adverts promising \u201cBrexit is happening\u201d on 31 October, despite increasing uncertainty over whether it actually will, PA Media reports. Figures from Facebook showed the government had paid out \u00a330,531 on the targeted posts in the five days since they were launched on 4 September \u2013 the same week MPs voted to block a no-deal departure. The adverts point to information for businesses and members of the public on how to prepare for the planned exit on Halloween. Jeremy Corbyn has described the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament this evening as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Asked about the move, Corbyn said: I think it is disgraceful. Parliament should be sitting. Parliament should be holding the government to account. And the prime minister appears to want to run away from questions. Corbyn also confirmed that the opposition parties have agreed not to back an early election until the government has complied with the bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. This is from Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, commenting after a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders this morning. One consequence of the decision to prorogue parliament this evening is that Boris Johnson will not have to give evidence to the Commons liaison committee at a session that was scheduled for Wednesday. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee (and a member of the liaison committee) has issue this statement on behalf of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum. He said: It is extraordinary that Boris Johnson will shut down parliament this evening for over a month at the very moment when we need our elected MPs to be in the House of Commons holding the government to account. It also means that the prime minister will avoid having to face questions from the liaison committee on Wednesday. I don\u2019t think he was relishing the prospect. Richard Benyon, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who lost the whip last week after he voted against the government, has announced he is standing down at the next election. Here is a full list of MPs who are standing down. There are now almost 20 MPs, elected as Tories at the last election, who have said they are not standing again. Almost all are from the centrist, one nation wing of the party. There are another 13 who could go because they lost the whip last week and may struggle to get re-elected as independents. Back in the public administration committee, Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, said that in the event of a general election, essential government business could continue. That would include the Brexit talks, he said. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have issued a joint statement following their talks in Dublin. Here it is in full. They said that while \u201ccommon ground\u201d was established in some areas, \u201csignificant gaps\u201d remain between them. The prime minister and the taoiseach had a positive and constructive meeting in Government Buildings this morning. This was an essential and timely opportunity for the prime minister and the taoiseach to establish a relationship and a better understanding of each other\u2019s positions. They spoke privately over breakfast for more than half an hour before joining their delegations for another half-hour meeting. While they agreed that the discussions are at an early stage, common ground was established in some areas although significant gaps remain. The UK and Ireland are committed to securing an agreement between the European Union and the UK, and recognise that negotiations take place through the Brussels taskforce. They also shared their commitment to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and the restoration of the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland. They look forward to meeting each other again in the near future. Labour\u2019s Rupa Huq goes next. Q: When were you told of the PM\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament for five weeks? Sedwill says the paper has been revealed in court. He was on holiday at the time, but he was kept informed, and read that paper on the day it was submitted to the PM, or the day after. The SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan asks if, in the event of a vote of no confidence, the PM could just run down the clock for 14 days without recommending an alternative PM to the Queen. Sedwill confirms that that is the case. Sedwill suggests that, following a vote of no confidence, the prime minster would not be obliged to suggest an alternative PM to the Queen. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. There is a live feed here. Sedwill has just said the prime minister is under a duty to resign only when he, or she, can make a recommendation to the Queen as to who is most likely to be able to command the confidence of the House of Commons. That is a political judgment the PM must exercise, with advice from the cabinet secretary. Q: Does the PM need to test that, with a sitting House of Commons? No, says Sedwill. He says when Boris Johnson was appointed there was talk of having a vote of confidence in the house. But that did not go ahead. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Downing Street has also insisted, again, that Boris Johnson will refused to request an article 50 extension - even though legislation passed last week, and due to receive royal assent later today, would require him to do this if MPs do not pass a deal or vote to approve a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: The prime minister is not going to seek an extension. If MPs want to resolve this there is an easy way - vote for an election today and let the public decide. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claims that Boris Johnson has changed tack and that he is now going \u201call out\u201d for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Here are the main quotes from the Boris Johnson/Leo Varadkar press conference. Boris Johnson insisted that he genuinely wanted to secure a Brexit deal before 31 October and he described a no-deal Brexit as \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d. This is a marked change of tone from Johnson, who in the past has repeatedly insisted that the dangers of no deal have been exaggerated by his critics. He said: I want to find a deal. I have looked carefully at no-deal. Yes, we could do it, the UK could certainly get through it, but be in no doubt that outcome would be a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible. He also insisted a deal could be achieved. I would overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement. I do believe that a deal can be done by October 18 [the final day of the EU summit] so let\u2019s do it together. He said he was \u201cundaunted\u201d by the opposition to his strategy in parliament. He said: We will come out on October 31, and I\u2019m sure that parliamentarians will see the wisdom of doing that and respecting, honouring, the referendum result - the democratic referendum result. And, I\u2019m absolutely undaunted by whatever may take place in parliament. I think what the British people want us to do is to deliver a deal and to get on and take us out on October 31. Leo Vardakar said that there would be no \u201cclean break\u201d for the UK from the EU, whatever happens later this year. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which poses a threat to the Tories at the next election, is demanding a no-deal Brexit, which it describes as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d. In a reference to this terminology, Varadkar said: The story of Brexit will not end if the United Kingdom leaves on 31 October or even 31 January \u2013 there is no such thing as a clean break. No such thing as just getting it done. Rather, we just enter a new phase. If there is no deal, I believe that\u2019s possible, it will cause severe disruption for British and Irish people alike. We will have to get back to the negotiating table. When we do, the first and only items on the agenda will be citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border. All the issues we had resolved in the withdrawal agreement we made with your predecessor. An agreement made in good faith by 28 governments. Varadkar said, even if there were a deal, negotiations between the UK and the EU would have to continue. We will enter talks on a future relationship agreement between the EU and UK. It\u2019s going to be tough dealing with issues ranging from tariffs to fishing rights, product standards and state aid. It will then have to be ratified by 31 parliaments. He said that, even if Johnson agreed a deal by 31 October, negotiating a free trade deal with the EU during the time set aside for the transition, and getting it ratified by all EU parliaments, would be a \u201cHerculean task\u201d. He said that he was prepared to listen to Johnson\u2019s ideas for an alternative to the backstop, but he would not just accept a \u201cpromise\u201d. He said: I am ready to listen, but what we will not do is replace a legal guarantee with a promise. He said he thought the EU would need a \u201cgood reason\u201d if it were to agree to another article 50 extension. He wanted this matter resolved at the October summit, he said. He explained: I\u2019m very keen to have this matter resolved at the EU summit. Brexit has dominated politics for far too long now. This is an opportunity for common ground and finding a solution. As for an extension, we\u2019d like to see this dealt with but if there is a good reason to have an extension we would consider it. He said Ireland would oppose the reintroduction of direct rule in Northern Ireland, which he said would be \u201ccontrary to the St Andrews agreement\u201d. Johnson claimed he had \u201can abundance of proposals\u201d for alternatives to the backstop. But he refused to give any detail of what they were. He said: I\u2019ve seen the old border and how absolutely vital it is we keep the open border, on the plan, it\u2019s fairly obvious, we need to find a way of ensuring that the UK is not kept locked in backstop arrangement while giving Ireland the assurance that it needs. Whether it\u2019s electronic pre-clearance or concept of the unity of island for agri-foods, and other ideas we\u2019ll bring forward to address the full range. I don\u2019t underestimate the technical problems but I do think there is a way through. Varadkar said having no backstop would mean there being no deal. He said: In the absence of agreed alternative arrangements, no backstop is no deal for us. Prorogation is the process that happens when parliament gets suspended at the end of one session of parliament before the start of another, which starts with a new Queens\u2019s speech. It is not the same as parliament being dissolved, which is what happens before a general election. And it is not the same as when parliament gets adjourned, for a recess, as happens over a holiday period. If you want to learn more about the process, this House of Commons library briefing note (pdf) may tell you everything you need to know. No 10 has confirmed at the morning lobby briefing that parliament will be prorogued at the end of proceedings tonight. This is from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. Up to 100 demonstrators gathered outside Leinster House, the Irish parliament, in Dublin this morning ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin, PA Media reports. The protest was led by Seamus McDonnell from Co Armagh, who chanted: \u201cNo customs, no border, no Brexit.\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in councillor Dessie Ellis said: We\u2019re here today to protest against Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin. We want to send out a strong message that we will not stand for a hard border or any border. There are people from all around the country here to tell him that today but particularly from the border region. People living in the border region will suffer immensely if a border comes back so the taoiseach needs to stand strong, stand his ground and give that message from the Irish people. The Criminal Bar Association has condemned suggestions from the government that it might try to ignore the law saying the PM would have to request a Brexit extension by 19 October, unless Boris Johnson either agrees a deal or gets MPs to vote for no deal. This is from the CBA\u2019s chair, Caroline Goodwin: As the CBA our role is not to say \u2018remain\u2019 or \u2018leave\u2019 but part of our role is to explain the law \u2013 criminal law \u2013 and play our part in upholding the rule of law. Standing up for the rule of law underpins our civil society \u2013 the economy, justice system, societal cohesion. In or out, the EU, a government that stands up for the rule of law acts in the best interests of the people \u2013 parliament included. Any government \u2013 the executive \u2013 which ignores the rule of law and actively seeks to break the law undermines the entire justice system, opens the door wide open to mob rule and very quickly to anarchy. How can a government on the one hand pledge to unleash a \u2018reign of terror\u2019 on criminals when its own leadership threatens to break the law? We cannot expect people not to rob, rape and murder when a government declares it may break the law. We cannot lay rape to the rule of law. And this is what other journalists are saying about the Boris Johnson/Leo Varadkar press conference. From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young From Euronews\u2019s Darren McCaffrey From the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam From politics.co.uk\u2019s Ian Dunt From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From the Irish News\u2019s Allison Morris That was a slightly longer press conference than we had been led to expect and, given the circumstances, it was perhaps not as frosty as it might have been. During the summer it emerged that, when Boris Johnson was foreign secretary, he once said about Leo Varadkar: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?\u201d Johnson campaigned for a policy outcome that will probably cause immense damage to the Irish economy, and for the last two years his Brexiter allies have frequently demonised Varadkar as the obstacle to a successful Brexit. Johnson then delayed his first visit to Dublin for weeks (despite this morning claiming that he believed it was important to speak to the Irish first \u2013 see 9.59am.) Varadkar could be forgiven for wanting to tell him to take a jump. Instead, Varadkar sounded sincere about wanting to ensure Ireland remains a friend to the UK in the future. (Realistically, that\u2019s the only sensible economic strategy.) And Johnson sounded considerably more measured and composed than he did in his public appearances on Thursday and Friday last week (not difficult). Perhaps shaken by the way people like his brother Jo Johnson and Amber Rudd have concluded he is not serious about finding a Brexit deal, he was much more negative about the reality of a no-deal Brexit than he has been for ages, describing it as \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d. But that did not prevent Johnson being disconcerted by some of the questions. He repeatedly dodged a question about when he last visited the Irish border. He ignored a question about whether he stood by the claim he one made about how technology could solve the border issue because that is how the congestion charge is enforced on the border between Camden and Islington. And he was humbled by a brilliant question pointing out that, while he is happy to use \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d as a metaphor, Brexit undermines arrangements that have preserved the peace in an country where until recently hundreds of people did end up dead in ditches literally. Johnson claimed to have \u201can abundance of proposals\u201d to resolve the backstop. (See 10.08am.) But, unless he is moving towards approving a Northern Ireland-only backstop (which is possible, although the DUP would erupt), his comments about wanting to preserve the all-Ireland economy while avoiding border checks and still taking the UK out of the EU, suggest he is still fundamentally stranded in \u2018have cake and eat it\u2019 territory. Johnson\u2019s strategy is driven by the understandable belief that many British voters just want to see Brexit done and for the whole crisis to go away. But this may be misconceived. As Varadkar argued forcefully in his opening remarks, there is no such thing as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d, and this problem will be with us for years. (See 9.47am.) Q: The Irish say they have received no new proposals today. Have you got anything today? And if you create an all-Ireland agrifoods zone, won\u2019t that put a border in the Irish Sea that the DUP won\u2019t accept. Johnson says the government has \u201can abundance of proposals\u201d. But he does not want to share them with the media. He says he will discuss ideas with Varadkar. He wants changes to the political declaration, as well as to the withdrawal agreement. He says he thinks he has \u201cthe ideal amount of time\u201d to sort this out. Angela Merkel said 30 days would be enough to find a solution. She was right. Varadkar says \u201cno backstop is no deal\u201d. That is not an option Ireland finds acceptable, he says. And that\u2019s it. I will give a verdict, summary and reaction soon. Q: When you talk about people being dead in ditches, there is a sense that you don\u2019t really understand what is at stake here. When did you last visit the border? Do you still think it is like the border between Camden and Islington? Johnson says he thinks everyone here understands the importance of the border. The UK will never impose checks at the border, he says. There must be an open border, so goods and people can circulate in the normal way. He says he genuinely thinks that solutions can be found. Varadkar says he hopes this will get settled at the EU summit in October. Most EU countries would prefer not to have an extension. But if there were a \u201cgood reason\u201d for one, the EU would consider it. Q: How can you convince Varadkar that you have the power to get anything through parliament? Johnson says everyone can see the Brexit talks have been going on for far too long. The EU wants this done, and he wants this done. And he thinks parliamentarians will see the wisdom of this. He claims he is \u201cundaunted\u201d by what is happening in parliament. The British people want him to deliver Brexit. He says he wants to \u201cmanage down\u201d expectations. I don\u2019t think we are going to have a complete breakthrough here today. Q: What would the Irish government think about London imposing direct rule on Northern Ireland? Varadkar says the Irish would oppose direct rule, as contrary to the St Andrews agreement. Johnson and Varadkar are now taking questions. Q: Have you visted the border as PM? And when are we going to see the detail of your backstop plan? Johnson says he knows what the border was like in the old days. He knows how vital it is not to return to those days. He claims that the \u201clanding zone\u201d is obvious. There are two areas where progress can be made. First, there is a lot that can be done on trusted traders schemes etc. Second, you can accept the unity of Ireland for sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. He says, if you can address these two points, you can go a long way towards a solution. He says he accepts \u201cthe locus for the negotiation remains Brussels\u201d. But he wants to discuss with the Irish how they can assist with that process. Other EU leaders ask him if he has made progress with the Irish. So it is incumbent on the UK to talk first to Ireland. (But Johnson has not talked first to Ireland. He visited Berlin and Paris first, last month.) Johnson says he wants a deal. They have spent three years \u201cmasticating\u201d over this problem. He says their predecessors solved far harder problems. Johnson says there are two tasks before November. They must restore the government in Northern Ireland. And they must get Brexit done, he says. The UK must come out by 31 October or \u201cpermanent damage\u201d may be done to trust in the political system. There are three questions to resolve, he says. 1) Can they ensure that unchecked movement of goods and people, and cattle, continues at the border? Johnson says he thinks the answer is yes. 2) Can they maintain the Belfast agreement? Johnson says he thinks the answer is yes. 3) Can we protect the economic unity of Ireland. Again, Johnson says he thinks the answer is yes. Johnson says the government must achieve these aims, while allowing the UK to leave the EU. He says he thinks, when you look at these problems, there are practical solutions. If there weren\u2019t, the backstop would not be described as a backstop. Johnson says he wants to get a deal. A no-deal Brexit would be \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says he first met Varadkar at a St Patrick\u2019s day parade in London when he was mayor. He says the \u201cvast crowd\u201d illustrated the close and intricate relationship between the British and the Irish. He says their predecessors took the two countries forward in circumstances that were much harder. He says the British eat 50% of cheese and beef produced in Ireland. And the England cricket captain was born in Dublin, he says. Varadkar quotes from something Gen Alan Brooke wrote about seeing Ireland when flying back after a visit to the US with Churchill during the second world war. Leo Varadkar is speaking now. He says there will be no such thing as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d. He says if there is no deal, the UK will have to renegotiate a new relationship with the EU anyway. And he says that, even if there is a deal, they will have to negotiate a trade deal. Varadkar says there can be no such thing as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d. He says he thinks a Brexit deal is possible. And he says Ireland wants to be a friend to the UK in a future. On the backstop, he says Ireland cannot replace a legal deal with a promise. Varadkar he says is not willing to replace the backstop with a promise. He says he and Boris Johnson have spoken twice by phone. But the UK has still not proposed a legal, operative alternative to the backstop, he says. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have posed for a picture on the steps of Government Buildings. But they just gone in without speaking to the media. But they might come out again. Someone has been testing the microphones. And the two podiums have been moved, so they are now near the door, and under shelter. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Boris Johnson has repeatedly claimed that the talks with the EU intended to find an alternative to the backstop are advancing well. \u201cWe are making substantial progress,\u201d he told MPs at PMQs on Wednesday. But yesterday Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, said the opposite. As the FT reports in its splash (paywall), this is what he said when asked if he agreed that progress was being made in the talks. If that is what\u2019s being said, that\u2019s a very optimistic assessment of where we stand. We will hear from both leaders imminently. Immediately after the Today programme\u2019s interview with the former supreme court judge Lord Sumption (see 9.07am), for a counter view they put up the backbench Tory Brexiter Nigel Evans. He did not seem too bothered by Sumption\u2019s argument that the strategy outlined in the Daily Telegraph would be unlawful. He said he and his colleagues had been discussing in the House of Commons tearoom on Thursday what Boris Johnson might do to circumvent the law requiring him to ask for a no-deal Brexit, and Evans said: \u201cWe whittled them down to about 20.\u201d He did not list all 20, but he referred to two: the government tabling a vote of no confidence in itself, or the government passing a one-line bill setting the date for an early election. Evans also argued that, even though Johnson did not have the support of the Commons, he did have the backing of the public. Evans explained: You have to remember, 400 MPs representing leave seats voted remain. You really do have parliament against the people. It\u2019s not a great look. And I will be standing alongside the prime minister in trying to deliver what the people voted for. The two ideas Evans did propose are problematic. The government could in theory try to pass a vote of no confidence in itself, but that would open up a 14-day period during which MPs could agree to support an alternative PM and government. And it could try to pass primary legislation requiring an election on 15 October, but that would require a majority, which Johnson does not have, and it could be amended in ways unacceptable to Number 10. Another former lord chancellor, David Gauke, has also said that the plan to try to sabotage any letter sent to the EU requesting a Brexit delay with a second hostile letter would not work. Gauke, of course, is one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed last week after voting against the government on this issue. I\u2019m sorry comments were not open earlier. They are open now. When Boris Johnson was deciding whether to back remain or leave in the EU referendum in 2016, he famously wrote two versions of his column for the Telegraph, one making the case for remain and one making the case for leave, before finally making his mind up \u2013 and publishing the leave one. In other circumstances, and for other individuals, that might be seen as a reasonable approach to taking a difficult decision. But because of Johnson\u2019s long record of inconsistency, the story has come to be seen as emblematic of his duplicity. As referred to earlier, according to today\u2019s Daily Telegraph splash (paywall), Johnson is considering a new version of the \u201ctwo contradictory letters strategy\u201d to try to confound the law passed by parliament requiring him to request an article 50 extension if he has failed to agree a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted to agree no deal (which they won\u2019t). Here is an extract from Owen Bennett and Harry Yorke\u2019s story. Boris Johnson has drawn up plans to \u201csabotage\u201d any Brexit extension without breaking the law, the Telegraph has learnt ... One plan under serious consideration would see the prime minister send an accompanying letter alongside the request to extend article 50 setting out that the government does not want any delay after Oct 31. On Sunday night, a cabinet source told The Telegraph: \u201cThere is a prescribed letter that has to be sent ... Does that stop the prime minister sending other documents to the EU? I don\u2019t think it does. \u201cA political explainer perhaps, as to where the government\u2019s policy is. It has to make clear that the government is asking for an extension, but let\u2019s not forget what the next step is. \u201cOnce that is done, the Europeans are going to ask: \u2018Why? What is the reason?\u2019 [What] if the government said: \u2018We don\u2019t have any reasons for an extension\u2019? \u201cThere is a clear path now: the Europeans need to refuse an extension.\u201d Lord Sumption, a former supreme court judge, told the Today programme earlier this would be illegal. (See 8.09am.) This is what he said when asked if it would be legal for the PM to seek an article 50 extension while trying to sabotage the strategy at the same time. No, of course it wouldn\u2019t. The bill, or act as it\u2019s about to become, says that he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. Not only has he got to send the letter, he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. To send the letter and then try to neutralise it seems to me, plainly, a breach of the act. What you\u2019ve got to realise is the courts are not very fond of loopholes. Other lawyers have said the same thing. This is from Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor. And these are from Adam Wagner, the barrister and legal commentator. From the Irish Times\u2019 Pat Leahy Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Patrick Greenfield. Boris Johnson is in Dublin already for his talks with Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister). They are due to hold a mini press conference at about 9.15am. Journalists are already outside Government Buildings in Dublin, where Varadkar\u2019s office is based, waiting for the leaders to arrive. Julian Smith has indicated he will not resign from the government despite official papers released last week indicating the Northern Ireland secretary had clashed with No10 over suspending parliament. Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders working to stop a no-deal Brexit will meet again this morning to plan their next steps, according to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The government is expected to lose another attempt to force an October election later today. Meanwhile, our Brexit correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, is in Dublin waiting for the British prime minister to arrive. The former supreme court judge Lord Sumption has told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that simultaneously asking the EU for an extension while asking the bloc to reject the request would not be legal. This is how Boris Johnson\u2019s government is planning to sabotage any Brexit extension without breaking the law, according to the Telegraph. Johnson and Varadkar are taking questions just after 9am as the prime minister arrives in Dublin. We\u2019ll bring you the most important answers. Paschal Donohoe, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, has told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that his government would support a further Brexit extension but said it needed the backing of all EU27 member states. Ahead of today\u2019s meeting between Boris Johnson and the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, Donohoe said the Irish were looking forward to further understanding the UK government\u2019s Brexit views and discussing the political standoff in Northern Ireland. Direct rule from London under a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cexceptionally serious\u201d, according to the Irish finance minister. Good morning readers. I\u2019m taking over the live blogging reins until Andrew Sparrow is ready to guide you through another big day of Brexit developments. Nobody from the government is doing any broadcast rounds this morning, it appears, but I will bring you the most important politics news lines as they happen. Tweet me at @pgreenfielduk if you have any questions. We\u2019ve already heard this morning about the potential impact of Brexit on the economy, according to KPMG. But for a real-time picture, we can see that the pound rose close to $1.23 earlier this morning before slipping back. It is now buying $1.227. It is worth \u20ac1.113. The pound has benefited from the government\u2019s recent calamities, which investors have seen as making no deal less likely, in turn pushing up sterling. The other big story of the day so far is that British Airways has been forced to cancel \u201cnearly 100% of our flights\u201d after pilots went on strike for 48 hours over pay. BA told passengers in a statement on its website: We understand the frustration and disruption Balpa\u2019s strike action has caused you. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this. The pilots are on strike for 48 hours and have further action planned on 27 September. The airline said it was offering all affected customers full refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or alternative airline. Flights on BA CityFlyer, SUN-AIR and Comair were not affected. BA operates more than 800 flights a day, with most expected to be cancelled, affecting up to 145,000 passengers each day. You can read our full story on the strike here. The Labour MP John Mann, who quit the party on Saturday to become the government\u2019s antisemitism tsar, has been speaking to the BBC about his new role and Brexit. Taking Brexit first, Mann told the Today programme that activists knocking on the doors of Labour voters in the north of England heartlands \u201cwould find voters who voted Brexit and who reject the direction that Jeremy Corbyn was taking the party\u201d. He added: The vast majority of Labour supporters in the heartlands voted Brexit. They are despairing about what they are seeing in parliament. They are scratching their heads, wondering what Labour is for. An opponent of Jeremy Corbyn, Mann denied he would use his new role as the government\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d antisemitism role as a way of attacking the Labour leader\u2019s record on the issue. \u201cThat would be dismissive of antisemitism \u2026 Labour has to get its act together and root out antisemitism,\u201d he said. We are likely to hear a great deal more about the government\u2019s manoeuvres in the next few days. But a reader\u2019s letter raises an interesting argument that some of the farcical episodes in the Johnson administration\u2019s short tenure \u2013 think the bungled police academy speech and even Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Commons slouch \u2013 are all part of the masterplan to distract voters from the serious defeats being inflicted on the government at Westminster. You can read it here: Norman Smith, the BBC\u2019s assistant political editor, has just been talking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme talking about some of the machinations we might expect at Westminster today. He said if MPs do reject the government\u2019s bid to force an election and then the no-deal bill is given royal assent, we can expect Downing Street to prorogue parliament. This is because the government has no other way of preventing rebel Tory MPs and opposition parties from seizing total control of the parliamentary timetable and holding debates on, for example, forcing the release of details of the no-deal Brexit planning document, Operation Yellowhammer. Smith said Johnson had \u201clost control of parliament, his majority, control of election timing, and a no-deal Brexit. He can\u2019t do much.\u201d He also adds that his sources maintain No 10 would \u201cnot break the law\u201d by ignoring the no-deal bill. \u201cIt\u2019s not an option,\u201d he said. The latest gloomy report about what will happen to the economy in the event of no deal comes from KPMG. The consultancy predicts Britain would lose 1.5% growth and fall into its first recession for a decade if we crash out. Consumer spending would be badly hit, it says. Yael Selfin, KPMG UK\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cWith the Brexit debate poised on a knife-edge, the UK economy is now at a crossroads.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: A retail footfall survey today adds to the downbeat economic mood. It says visits to the high street were down 1.9% in the three months to the end of August as people preferred out-of-town centres or online shopping. My colleague Miles Brignall has the full story here: Given the complexity of the political situation, it is not surprising that there is considerable divergence on way the papers have approached the Brexit turmoil today. The Times\u2019 splash headline says \u201cJohnson in retreat over delay to Brexit\u201d but the Telegraph reckons No 10 has a plan to thwart backbenchers\u2019 no-deal bill, saying: \u201cJohnson \u2018can legally stop Brexit extension\u2019\u201d. The Telegraph quotes a No 10 source as saying that, if the government is forced to request an extension to article 50 as the backbench no-deal bill will do, it could append a letter to the request saying that the UK does not have any reason to extend the deadline for Brexit from 31 October. The source tells the Telegraph (whose star columnist used to be the PM): Once that is done, the Europeans are going to ask: \u2018Why? What is the reason?\u2019 [What] if the Government said: \u2018We don\u2019t have any reasons for an extension\u2019? There is a clear path now: the Europeans need to refuse an extension.\u201d The Scotsman reports \u201cJohnson will \u2018test to the limit\u2019 no-deal legislation\u201d. The Guardian throws it forward to focus on Johnson\u2019s trip to Ireland: \u201cPM heads to Dublin amid fears of more resignations\u201d, on which subject the FT says: \u201cVaradkar plays down prospects of progress on Brexit deadlock\u201d. The Mail has its own Brexit scoop from an interview with the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, a remainer who nevertheless pledges to remain loyal to Johnson. But she demands of his approach to talks with the EU: \u201cWhat is your plan, Boris?\u201d. The Express proclaims \u201cBritain is still backing Boris\u201d. The Sun says the PM will fight the no-deal bill in court but leads with: \u201cLittle Mix Jesy: my suicide bid\u201d. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. This is Martin Farrer kicking off the blog before Andy Sparrow and my colleagues in London take over on what promises to be another momentous day at Westminster and beyond. After the resignation of the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, dealt another blow to Boris Johnson\u2019s government, there is more fevered speculation about whether or not the prime minister will try to bypass the backbench bill blocking no deal if, as is likely, it becomes law today. It seems probable that there will be more twists and turns than an Ashes series, but here are some of the fixed points, along with possible developments: Boris Johnson heads to Dublin for talks with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on how to break the stalemate over a solution to the Irish backstop. Read our splash story on this subject here. Johnson will then fly back to London where he is expected to make another attempt to force a general election on 15 October by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The gambit is likely to fail, according to most calculations, because opposition parties still want to ensure that a no-deal Brexit is definitely off the table before they go to the country. This would enable them to portray Johnson as having broken his key promise of delivering Brexit \u201ccome what may\u201d on 31 October, writes Michael Savage, in this very handy explainer about what\u2019s been going on and what lies ahead. Meanwhile, the backbench bill to block no deal is expected to receive royal assent today. If that goes ahead, the key question will be whether Johnson is somehow able to circumvent the legislation and go ahead with Brexit. There are reports swirling around that No 10 believes it can go to court to get around the law, but an equal number saying the government won\u2019t be able to. The latter point to a tweet by justice secretary Robert Buckland that he has spoken to the PM \u201cregarding the importance of the rule of law\u201d. There is the possibility that the EU could prevent Britain from delaying its exit anyway, according to our Brussels correspondent Daniel Boffey. And there is also the chance of further cabinet resignations following Rudd\u2019s decision to stand down. We report that she has been contacted by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers worried about the government\u2019s Brexit policy since tendering her resignation. In all the chaos you might have missed the fact that Rudd was replaced as work and pensions secretary yesterday by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, MP for Suffolk Coastal, a loyalist who was promoted from her role as environment minister. And I liked this picture of Johnson and his latest nemesis at the Tory conference last year. She was a big fan of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s bid for the leadership:",

      "bodyText": "The corporate regulator has appealed against a judge\u2019s ruling that Westpac did not engage in irresponsible lending, in part because home loan customers could trim their spending by cutting out meals of wagyu beef and fine shiraz. Consumer groups last month blasted the decision, made by the federal court judge Nye Perram, as out of touch with the community. It has also played into an ongoing debate over whether the courts have made it too hard for regulators to prove companies breached the law by doing things that damaged the interests of their customers. In a notice of appeal filed with the court, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said Perram was wrong when he said Westpac took the living expenses of loan applicants into account by using a rule where more scrutiny was applied when customers declared their expenses were more than 70% of their income. Perram was also wrong to accept Westpac\u2019s characterisation of interest-only loans, Asic told the court. \u201cAsic considers that the federal court\u2019s decision creates uncertainty as to what is required for a lender to comply with its assessment obligation, nor does Asic regard the decision as consistent with the legislative intention of the responsible lending regime,\u201d the Asic commissioner Sean Hughes said. \u201cFor those reasons, Asic will appeal to the full court of the federal court.\u201d In his judgment, Perram said knowing how much a customer spent on food did not tell the bank the minimum amount the client had to spend on food. \u201cI may eat wagyu beef everyday washed down with the finest shiraz but, if I really want my new home, I can make do on much more modest fare,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing the amount I actually expend on food tells one nothing about what that conceptual minimum is.

Johnson\u2019s official spokesman insisted on Monday that he would abide by the rule of law but, at the same time, the prime minister has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to article 50. Johnson later told the Commons repeatedly: \u201cI will not ask for another delay.\u201d Following the defeats, several Tory MPs said they believed Johnson was trying to find a way to bring back some of the 21 Conservatives from whom he removed the whip for defying his Brexit policy last week. The aim of the Grieve motion was to prove that Johnson and his administration had misled MPs with their claim that the move to shut down parliament for five weeks was not to frustrate debate about Brexit. Grieve said he had asked for the information relating to prorogation because public officials had informed him that \u201cthey believed the handling of this matter smacked of scandal\u201d. However, senior government aides suggested No 10 would refuse to comply, potentially putting Johnson and senior members of his administration in contempt of parliament and creating a fresh clash between the executive and MPs. Cummings has already been found in contempt of parliament once before after failing to appear before a select committee investigating fake news. One government source said the vote was \u201can abuse of parliamentary procedure and would never have been allowed under an impartial speaker\u201d. \u201cIf MPs want to seize the private texts of advisers to their friends, families, colleagues and journalists then they can speak to people\u2019s lawyers,\u201d they said. A Downing Street spokesman said the scope of information requested was \u201cdisproportionate and unprecedented\u201d. However, Bercow said the \u201cgovernment must comply with the humble address ... that is the reality\u201d, even in a period of prorogation. The government suspended sitting in the House of Commons and House of Lords until 14 October \u2013 a move condemned by opposition parties and anti-no-deal Tories. Criticising the prorogation, Corbyn, said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and accused Johnson of wanting to run away from questions.",

Amid calls for his resignation, Ross\u2019 Commerce Department denied the report. The department\u2019s inspector general is now reportedly launching an inquiry into the incident. At a rally in North Carolina, Trump quipped that he might need an extra term as president because he would otherwise be out of office before the 2026 World Cup. \u201cWe told you he\u2019s a dictator, we told you,\u201d Trump said, impersonating his critics. \u201cI\u2019m only kidding,\u201d he said. Trump dismissed Afghanistan peace talks as \u201cdead\u201d after he scrapped a secret (and controversial) plan to meet with Taliban leaders at Camp David. The president cautioned that the United States must be \u201cvery careful\u201d about allowing Bahamians affected by Hurricane Dorian into the country, echoing concerns voiced by a senior immigration official earlier today. Democratic officials called on Mitch McConnell to take up a bill expanding background checks that has already passed the House. McConnell said he would talk to Trump Tuesday about what he would support. The US government chose to extract a high-level source in the Russian government in 2017 over concerns that Trump or his administration may compromise the source\u2019s identity, CNN reported. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, predicted over the weekend that the president\u2019s family would become \u201ca dynasty that will last for decades\u201d. The US secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, is facing calls for his resignation after it was reported that he had threatened to fire senior staff at a federal agency unless they sided publicly with Donald Trump in the rumbling dispute dubbed \u201cSharpiegate\u201d. The New York Times, citing three anonymous officials, reported that Ross had called Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), last Friday and warned that heads would roll unless the agency\u2019s disagreement with the US president over the path of Hurricane Dorian was smoothed over. Trump\u2019s comment about needing an extra term came as he was discussing the World Cup. Trump told his supporters at a rally in North Carolina that he might need an extra term as president, then mocked the idea that news headlines tomorrow will announce that he said he wants an extra term. \u201cWe told you he\u2019s a dictator, we told you,\u201d Trump said, impersonating his critics. \u201cI\u2019m only kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m only kidding.\u201d Just as a Republican congressional candidate had started to speak, Trump paused the rally for several minutes and repeatedly said \u201cthank you\u201d to a doctor presumably assisting an audience member who was unwell. Then the president quipped, \u201cI guess Dan\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t so good,\u201d referring to Dan Bishop, a Republican congressional candidate the president had flown to North Carolina to support. Congressional candidate Dan Bishop started to speak after Trump, but as stopped speaking as members of the crowd started calling for a doctor to help someone in the audience who is unwell. President Trump also echoed their calls for a doctor. \u201cFour more years!\u201d Trump supporters are chanting as the President speaks in North Carolina to support Republican Congressional candidate Dan Bishop in advance of a special election tomorrow. Trump\u2019s speech revisited familiar themes: the idea that the news media and the Democratic party are both enemies that he has to fight, the strength of the economy, the necessity of building a wall on the United States\u2019 border with Mexico, and the supposed dangers of \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies. \u201cThe state should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens,\u201d Trump said. The Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general is now looking int a statement NOAA put out last week in the midst of a controversy over President Trump\u2019s hurricane tweet, the New York Times is reporting. Earlier, the Commerce Department made a statement denying that commerce secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire NOAA officials, as the Times had reported. I\u2019m still listening to 2020 Democratic candidate and Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan\u2019s newly-launched \u201cpolicy album\u201d on Spotify. On track 7 now. There is no music, there are not even any sound effects. It\u2019s just Ryan\u2019s voice, for \u201ctrack\u201d after \u201ctrack.\u201d Why. Update: I could not force myself to listen to this entire \u201calbum.\u201d I stopped after \u201cTrack 8: Gun Control,\u201d in which Ryan described himself as a \u201cleader\u201d on gun violence prevention (he is not), but did not mention his previous A rating from the National Rifle Association, or his decision in 2017 to give roughly $20,000, the amount he received in political contributions from the NRA, to gun control groups. The US Air Force is officially announcing a review of where it places air crews during overnight stop overs, following questions about stop overs at a Trump-owned luxury resort in Scotland, the New York Times\u2019 Eric Lipton reports. Tim Ryan, a Democratic congressman from Ohio and 2020 presidential primary contender, has released a \u201cpolicy album\u201d on Spotify with ten \u201ctracks.\u201d 1. Intro 2. Education 3. Climate Change 4. Regenerative Agriculture 5. Healthcare 6. College Affordability 7. New Industrial Policy 8. Gun Control 9. Immigration 10. Outro I am listening to these \u201ctracks,\u201d and I will let you know if I hear any music, or anything other than Tim Ryan talking which is....not an album. Track 2, education, includes Ryan talking about the way that childhood trauma affects kids\u2019 brains and their ability to learn. Ryan, who is married to an elementary school teacher, also says that he wants a salad bar and a garden in every school in America. The Commerce Department is denying a New York Times report that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week in the midst of the \u201cSharpiegate\u201d controversy. Ross\u2019s threat to fire officials at NOAA, which is a division of the Commerce Department, came after the agency\u2019s Birmingham office publicly contradicted President Trump\u2019s claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama, the Times reported, citing \u201cthree people familiar with the discussion.\u201d Meanwhile, citing the New York Times report, the Sierra Club is calling on Ross to resign. \u201cThis shameless abuse of power could have devastating results now and in the future, demonstrating that Ross is unfit to continue in the cabinet and that he does not care that he is supposed to represent the American public above Trump\u2019s fragile ego,\u201d Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement, The Hill reported. What gun control measures might President Trump actually support? Republican Congressional leaders will discuss this with him tomorrow, NBC News reports: This is Lois Beckett in our west coast office picking up our live politics coverage. Donald Trump is en route to a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he is expected to speak after 7pm Eastern Time. If you need a brief break from American political news today, I recommend my colleague Vivian Ho\u2019s feature on the Internet\u2019s obsession with \u201cchonky cats\u201d, and the subsequent anxiety about the health of these Insta-famous feline chonk stars. Should all the chonky cats really be on diets? Watching my colleague factcheck the chonkiness of the cats she was profiling was a master class in journalistic excellence. As Vivian put it: That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump dismissed Afghanistan peace talks as \u201cdead\u201d after he scrapped a secret (and controversial) plan to meet with Taliban leaders at Camp David. The president cautioned that the United States must be \u201cvery careful\u201d about allowing Bahamians affected by Hurricane Dorian into the country, echoing concerns voiced by a senior immigration official earlier today. Those two comments came as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cchopper talk\u201d before departing for North Carolina, where he is holding a campaign rally for the special congressional race happening there tomorrow. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, reportedly threatened firings at a government agency that contradicted the president\u2019s false claim about Hurricane Dorian potentially hitting Alabama. Democratic officials called on Mitch McConnell to take up a bill expanding background checks that has already passed the House. The US government chose to extract a high-level source in the Russian government in 2017 over concerns that Trump or his administration may compromise the source\u2019s identity, CNN reported. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, predicted over the weekend that the president\u2019s family would become \u201ca dynasty that will last for decades\u201d. Lois will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. The husband of Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, appears to be seeking a divorce. The AP reports: The papers, which provide only initials, were filed Friday by TMP against SLP. Todd Palin\u2019s middle name is Mitchell and Sarah Palin\u2019s middle name is Louise. The documents say the couple married on 29 August 1988 \u2013 the same as the Palins. Birthdates for the two also correspond. The documents say the couple has a minor child identified as TPVP who was born 18 April 2008. The Palins\u2019 youngest child, Trig Paxson Van Palin, was born that day. Palin ran alongside the late senator John McCain in 2008, but the pair lost to Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The former Alaska governor later became one of Trump\u2019s first major endorsers in 2016. More from that \u201cchopper talk\u201d a bit ago: Trump waved away reports that officials like Mike Pence and John Bolton had advised him against holding Taliban peace talks at Camp David. \u201cI took my own advice,\u201d Trump said of scrapping the secret plan. \u201cWe had a meeting scheduled. It was my idea, and it was my idea to terminate it. I didn\u2019t even ... I didn\u2019t discuss it with anybody else.\u201d Trump added he had unilaterally decided to cancel the talks after an American soldier was killed by a Taliban suicide bomb last week. He declared the peace talks to be now \u201cdead.\u201d The president has often bristled at any suggestion that a member of his administration, even the vice president, may know better than him. But it would be pretty remarkable if he consulted with no one before canceling the unprecedented talks. Eight Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, appeared in a video for the gun-control group Giffords. The group is launching a video series it\u2019s calling the Gun Safety President campaign to highlight candidates\u2019 stances on the issue. \u201cWe can continue with the corrupt leadership of Donald Trump, who has taken millions from the NRA while opposing gun safety policies \u2014 or we can forge a new path and elect a gun safety president who\u2019s willing to stand up to the gun lobby and protect our kids and communities from gun violence,\u201d said former representative Gabby Giffords, the group\u2019s namesake who was shot at a constituent event in 2011. The video was released the same day that Democratic lawmakers held an event calling on the Senate to pass a bill expanding background checks to all gun purchases. Just when we thought we could put Sharpiegate behind us, a report has emerged that Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, threatened firings at the NOAA after the agency contradicted the president\u2019s false claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama. The New York Times reports: That threat led to an unusual, unsigned statement later that Friday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disavowing the office\u2019s own position that Alabama was not at risk. The reversal caused widespread anger within the agency and drew criticism from the scientific community that NOAA, a division of the Commerce Department, had been bent to political purposes. ... Mr. Ross phoned Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of NOAA, from Greece where the secretary was traveling for meetings and instructed Dr. Jacobs to fix the agency\u2019s perceived contradiction of the president. Dr. Jacobs objected to the demand and was told that the political staff at NOAA would be fired if the situation was not fixed, according to the three individuals, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the episode. More from Trump\u2019s \u201cchopper talk\u201d before leaving for his North Carolina rally: the president warned that the US must be \u201cvery careful\u201d about allowing Bahamians affected by Hurricane Dorian into the country. \u201cWe have to be very careful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEveryone needs totally proper documentation...I don\u2019t want to allow people who weren\u2019t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people.\u201d Trump\u2019s acting Customs and Border Patrol chief, Mark Morgan, was vague earlier today when asked about admitting Bahamians into the country. He said the administration would work to expedite humanitarian entry requests from those affected by the hurricane but seemed hesitant about granting Bahamians Temporary Protected Status. Morgan\u2019s comments came after dozens of Bahamians were reportedly kicked off a Florida-bound ferry because they didn\u2019t have proper visas to visit the United States. The Democratic lawmakers\u2019 gun-control event has just ended, and they concluded by emphasizing it was the responsibility of Mitch McConnell and Trump to act. \u201cOur first job is to get Leader McConnell to put this on the floor,\u201d Schumer said. Asked why he was confident that Congress could pass gun legislation now when it\u2019s failed so many times before, Schumer replied that it was \u201ca different era.\u201d \u201cNever have we had 93 percent of American people for background checks,\u201d the Senate minority leader said of the strong public support for HR8. Schumer added that Trump has been \u201call over the lot\u201d when it comes to whether he would support expanding background checks. \u201cBut the pressure is not going away,\u201d Schumer said. Nancy Pelosi said Trump was initially enthusiastic about calling the Senate back to pass HR8, but she now fears that was just an attempt to \u201cdefang\u201d the pressure around gun control after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. But the House speaker stressed: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let the subject be changed or diminished in any way.\u201d Schumer noted that Trump initially told him he wanted the \u201cstrongest possible bill\u201d after those mass shootings, a sentiment the president also apparently shared with senator Sherrod Brown. Veronica Escobar, the Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso, said at the gun-control event that her constituents have asked her why leaders like Mitch McConnell have not \u201cfelt our pain.\u201d Escobar angrily pointed out that the background checks bill, HR8, could have prevented another shooting in her home state, in Odessa, Texas. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat of Michigan, noted that it has been over six months since the House passed HR8, yet the Senate has not acted. Nancy Pelosi took the podium at the gun-control event, echoing Chuck Schumer\u2019s demand that the Senate take up HR8, which would expand background checks to all gun sales. The House speaker then introduced the Democrats\u2019 star guest, Dayton mayor Nan Whaley. Just a month after the tragic shooting in her city, Whaley listed the other shootings that have taken place across America since February. She then called on the Senate to take an up-or-down vote on the background checks bill. Before handing the microphone to senator Sherrod Brown, Whaley emphasized how many Americans support expanding background checks. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything that 9 out of 10 Americans agree on except HR8,\u201d Whaley said. Democratic officials have started their event calling on the Senate to take up HR8, a bill that would enforce background checks for all gun purchases. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, arguing that passing HR8 should be the first order of business in the Senate now that lawmakers have returned to Capitol Hill after the August recess. The Senate minority leader then directly called on Trump to back the bill, noting that Mitch McConnell has said he will not act until he has the president\u2019s approval. \u201cPresident Trump, this bill is common sense,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe time to act is now.\u201d Chopper talk strikes again! Leaving the White House to travel to North Carolina for his campaign rally, Trump said peace talks with the Taliban were \u201cdead\u201d after the secret Camp David plan fell apart. The president specifically cited the recent death of an American solider in Afghanistan as a reason to distrust the Taliban. The vice president has similarly slammed the media for reporting that he, along with Trump\u2019s national security adviser, opposed the president\u2019s secret plan to hold peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. A Washington Post reporter noted that the tweet was unusual for Pence, who generally avoids specifically calling out the media: But NBC News\u2019 report on Pence\u2019s opposition to the proposal did note that the vice president\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Memo to United Nations: It\u2019s just two weeks to the UN General Assembly at that body\u2019s HQ in New York - the annual spectacle featuring world leaders doing sideline deals and taking it in turns to pontificate publicly in front of a weird green marble block. UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, has installed a sobering reminder, as kids worldwide return to school after the summer, of the devastating scale of child deaths in conflict zones in 2018 - 3,758 backpacks stood in rows reminiscent of a cemetery, each one representing the loss of a young life to war. The piece of political art was installed yesterday and runs through tomorrow, after which the backpacks will be used by children. \u201cUnicef backpacks have always been a symbol of hope and childhood possibility,\u201d said the agency\u2019s Henrietta Fore in a media release. \u201cIn just two weeks, world leaders gathering at the UN General Assembly will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This installation should remind them of the stakes.\u201d According to the 2019 Annual Report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict, more than 12,000 children were killed or maimed in conflict zones last year \u2013 the highest total since the UN started reporting the numbers. These only count verified incidents \u2013 the actual numbers are likely to be much higher, Unicef estimates, with more than a quarter of the total being killed. Fall-out is ongoing today from Donald Trump\u2019s revelation this weekend that he had been planning to talk to Taliban leaders face to face (oh, and as an apparent afterthought, also Afghanistan\u2019s president Ashraf Ghani) at Camp David in a hitherto secret meeting - that was then canceled. So it will remain to be seen how that all plays at the UNGA. Afghan children have suffered terribly during the long conflict there. Here\u2019s Donald (again)\u2026 The president is back online, with a tweeted repudiation of stories about how the plan to invite the Taliban to Camp David came about and fell apart, and therefore yet another taste of his oft-tweeted repudiation of the American mainstream press. Viz: As we noted earlier, NBC News reported today that Vice-President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton, two key administration figures, were against the idea of inviting the Taliban for peace talks on US soil, particularly in the week of the anniversary of the attacks of 11 September 2001, in which the Taliban was complicit. Trump initially proceeded with the plan, before surprising the world by announcing its abandonment on Sunday. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo spent Sunday morning defending the peace effort in Afghanistan on the talk shows, but said all such talks were off the table for now. On Monday, Trump duly had his own say, denying he overruled \u201cthe VP and various advisers on a potential Camp David meeting with the Taliban\u201d. Trump also called \u201cmuch of the media \u2026 simply an arm of the Democrat party\u201d and, of course, heralded his own leadership of a country in no way facing or worried about recession\u2026 Trump then saluted the efforts of US troops in Afghanistan, where they have been fighting since late 2001, and in there response to the death of an American soldier in Kabul last week, in a car bomb explosion. We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth. Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years! Here\u2019s world affairs editor Julian Borger\u2019s more considered take on the affair of the Taliban talks that weren\u2019t\u2026 Morgan\u2019s press briefing has concluded. The acting Customs and Border Patrol chief touched on a variety of topics, from the possibility of offering Bahamians Temporary Protected Status to immigration apprehension numbers last month. He repeatedly echoed Trump\u2019s talking points, such as arguing for the necessity of a border wall and slamming judges who have blocked some of his policies. Morgan clarified that there hasn\u2019t been any \u201cformal grant\u201d of Temporary Protected Status for all Bahamians affected by Hurricane Dorian. He has instead emphasized that CBP would work to expedite Bahamians\u2019 visa requests for humanitarian reasons. On another note, Morgan appeared to dodge a question about whether he agrees with Trump\u2019s reported preference to paint the wall black. Morgan said Bahamians struggling with the effects of Hurricane Dorian would be allowed into the United States on \u201chumanitarian reasons,\u201d but he stressed he would continue to observe US policies about denying entry to those with criminal histories, for example. The comments came after dozens of Bahamians were kicked off a Florida-bound ferry because they did not have visas to travel to the US. Morgan appears open to allowing more Bahamians entry to the country, but he also seems to be giving himself a lot of wiggle room to block some people from doing so. Morgan was asked about the US offering Temporary Protected Status to Bahamian residents who are grappling with the effects of Hurricane Dorian. The acting CBP chief said he would consider such a measure, but he emphasized the agency would not turn a \u201cblind eye\u201d to immigration procedures in reaction to the disaster. He added, \u201cWe would not support returning people to a place it\u2019s not safe to be.\u201d This is interesting. In addition to repeating Trump\u2019s false claim that the border wall is already being built, Morgan keeps emphasizing the importance of a \u201cwall system.\u201d He has specifically cited improved lighting and access roads along the border as a means of enhancing immigration enforcement. But Trump has repeatedly promised he would build a physical wall along the southern border. Could this signal a shift? Morgan deflected questions about concerns over how the border wall will be paid for, including by deflecting funds for dozens of military construction projects. Morgan said that wall funding was a \u201cpolitical\u201d issue and thus did not concern him, although he noted he had confidence in the secretary of defense. He said Mark Esper would not approve diverting funds unless he thought it was in the country\u2019s best interest. He also argued that the southern border represented a national security crisis, justifying the use of the diverted funds. Trump\u2019s acting CBP commissioner echoed the president\u2019s demands for a wall along the US-Mexico border, claiming experts have backed up the effectiveness of such a measure. \u201cIt works,\u201d Morgan said of a wall. \u201cThe experts say it works. The experts have asked for this.\u201d He also commended the Trump administration\u2019s work on the issue and called for Congress to act to close immigration \u201cloopholes.\u201d In short, Morgan is following through on a key reason why Trump appointed him, as an Axios reporter noted. Morgan noted the number of August apprehensions represented a 56-percent decrease since the 144,255 apprehensions in May. Morgan has taken the podium at the White House and is addressing the \u201cunprecedented crisis at the southern border.\u201d He noted that Customs and Border Patrol apprehended 64,000 undocumented migrants at the US-Mexico border last month. The acting commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol, Mark Morgan, will soon speak at a White House press briefing. (Morgan was originally scheduled to take the podium at 12:30 p.m. E.T., but that was pushed back to 1.) Morgan will likely be asked about his agency\u2019s decision not to change travel protocols for Bahamian visitors to the United States as the country recovers from Hurricane Dorian. Dozens of Bahamians were kicked off a Florida-bound ferry last night after it was announced they would still need a visa to travel to the US. Morgan defended the policy in a pair of tweets yesterday: Discussion has intensified recently around a core question in TrumpWorld: which of the president\u2019s children, if any, will prove to be his political successor? Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, predicted over the weekend that the president\u2019s family would become \u201ca dynasty that will last for decades.\u201d Obviously, the president\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, has a head start as the only one of his children serving as a senior White House adviser. But more recently, Donald Trump Jr has built a loyal following of his own as the president\u2019s eldest son goes around the country to enthusiastically campaign for Republican candidates. The Atlantic reports: By November 2018, Don had appeared at more than 70 campaign events across 17 states\u2014and powerful Republicans were abuzz. ... Notably, many of these Republicans seemed less enthusiastic about his sister. ... None of this newfound excitement about Don seemed to rub off on the president, however. People close to Trump told me he remained enchanted by the idea of Ivanka as the inheritor of his political legacy. ... On a steamy June evening, Trump officially launched his bid for reelection with a raucous rally in Orlando. This time, Ivanka and Jared sat in the audience, while Don\u2014the president\u2019s most skilled warm-up act\u2014strutted across the stage to fervid applause. ... While no one knew when Donald Trump would exit the White House, it was clear what he would leave behind when he did: an angry, paranoid scrap of the country eager to buy what he was hawking\u2014and an heir who knew how to keep the con alive. Trump is still attracting criticism for planning and then scrapping secret peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David, a proposal that even divided his closest advisers. The vice president, Mike Pence, was among those who opposed the idea. NBC News reports: The idea raised Sept. 1 during a Situation Room meeting with the president was vehemently opposed by national security adviser John Bolton, even as officials at the State Department argued it could move the parties closer to an agreement, officials said. Bolton had an ally in Vice President Mike Pence, who also made the case against a meeting at Camp David, a location Trump suggested, officials said. Bolton and Pence were in Warsaw together around the time of the internal discussions. ... Among the concerns of administration officials who opposed the meeting was that it might take place around the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, the officials and people familiar with the matter said. Pence argued at one point that such a meeting could send the wrong message to members of the U.S. military who have fought \u2014 and been killed by \u2014 the Taliban for years, one senior administration official said. Pence has usually fallen in step with the president\u2019s way of thinking, so his opposition in this case is notable. But what may be more notable is that Trump overruled Pence \u2014 siding instead with his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo \u2014 before ultimately canceling the proposed talks. Trump has just wrapped up a ceremony to award the Medal of Valor and Heroic Commendations to officers and civilians who aided victims in the El Paso and Dayton shootings. The event comes just hours before Democratic leaders will hold an event to call on the Senate to pass a bill expanding background checks. Multiple officials from cities that have experienced shootings, including the mayor of Dayton and the congresswoman who represents El Paso, are expected to participate. Trump left the event without taking any questions from reporters. Valerie Plame, the former CIA officer whose identity was famously leaked in 2003, has released the first ad for her congressional campaign in New Mexico. Plame announced back in May that she would run as a Democrat to succeed Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, the House Democrat who is forgoing re-election to run for the Senate. Plame\u2019s outing as a CIA official touched off a scandal in George W. Bush\u2019s administration that ultimately resulted in the conviction of Scooter Libby, a former top aide to Dick Cheney. Libby was pardoned by Trump last year. It has become quite apparent that Trump\u2019s tweets have affected global markets. And now one of the largest US banks has come up with a system to measure that effect. CNBC reports: In an attempt to quantify the impact of Trump\u2019s tweets on the bond market, J.P. Morgan devised a \u2018Volfefe Index\u2019 to analyze how the president\u2019s tweets are influencing volatility in U.S. interest rates. J.P. Morgan found that the index, named after Trump\u2019s infamous and still mysterious \u2018covfefe\u2019 tweet, explains a measurable fraction of the moves in implied rate volatility for 2-year and 5-year Treasurys. ... Out of about 4,000 non-retweets occurring during market hours from 2018 to the present, only 146 moved the market. The White House had no comment on the creation of the \u201cVolfefe Index,\u201d but Trump, who has previously been very sensitive to criticisms from business leaders, can\u2019t be pleased. The US government decided to extract a covert source from inside the Russian government in 2017, partly over concerns that Trump or his administration may compromise the source\u2019s identity, according to a CNN report. CNN reports: A person directly involved in the discussions said that the removal of the Russian was driven, in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy. The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. The intelligence, concerning ISIS in Syria, had been provided by Israel. The disclosure to the Russians by the President, though not about the Russian spy specifically, prompted intelligence officials to renew earlier discussions about the potential risk of exposure, according to the source directly involved in the matter. Trump quickly lashed out against CNN, although without explicitly referencing the report: And a former senior CIA official underscored the gravity of the report: Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary who has repeatedly engaged in so-far unsuccessful negotiations with Chinese officials to cool trade tensions, is adopting a \u201cnothing to see here, folks\u201d attitude about the tariffs\u2019 impact on the US economy. Mnuchin told Fox Business that the Trump administration has \u201cnot yet seen any impact on the U.S. economy\u201d stemming from the president\u2019s trade war, adding that there are \u201cno signs\u201d of a looming recession. The treasury secretary also voiced optimism about the trade talks resuming next month. \u201cThey\u2019re coming here. I take that as a sign of good faith that they want to continue to negotiate, and we\u2019re prepared to negotiate,\u201d Mnuchin said of his Chinese counterparts. But Mnuchin\u2019s cheery tone is somewhat undercut by the administration\u2019s own actions on the trade war. For example, Trump has signed off on billions of dollars in subsidies to farmers affected by China\u2019s retaliatory targeting of US agricultural goods. And yet the president has shown no sign of backing down. Mnuchin will have his work cut out for him next month. A new poll confirms what has been repeatedly shown in recent years: the overwhelming majority of Americans want tougher gun laws. According to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, 89 percent of Americans support universal background checks, and 86 percent back red flag laws, which would allow law enforcement to take guns from someone deemed dangerous by a judge. But what\u2019s more surprising is the support that more strict proposals, like an assault weapons ban, attract. A majority of Americans, 56 percent, say they support a ban on military-style assault weapons, and 52 percent support a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. Those policies have notoriously been the third rail for the Democratic Party since a number of House Democrats lost their seats after supporting an assault weapons ban in 1994. The poll may signal that public attitudes on those policies are changing, even if congressional inaction isn\u2019t changing along with them. The Democratic-controlled House has already passed a bill to expand background checks, but Mitch McConnell has not taken it up for a vote, and Trump has pledged to veto it. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are holding an event late today to call on the Senate to pass the bill, but McConnell will almost certainly remain obstinate unless Trump gives him the go-ahead signal. Trump is on a tweeting tear this morning. He has now weighed in on a Politico report that the Air Force is investigating why flights in recent months have refueled at a small airport near Trump\u2019s Scotland resort as government personnel stayed at the property. He also again denied he had anything to do with the vice president, Mike Pence, staying at his golf club in Ireland. (But Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, previously said Trump made a \u201csuggestion\u201d to stay there during an official government trip.) Politico has more on the Air Force investigation: The review comes as additional instances of military personnel staying at Trump properties have been uncovered. The C-17 crew\u2019s overnight stay at Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort in Scotland earlier this year, first reported by POLITICO on Friday, was not an isolated incident. In September 2018, on its way back to the U.S. from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a unit of the Maine Air National Guard landed at Prestwick Airport, the airport closest to Trump\u2019s luxury waterfront resort. The crew and their passengers then spent the night at his hotel, according to one person who was present, an Instagram post and a voucher detailing the crew\u2019s itinerary reviewed by POLITICO. The Air Force did not immediately respond to questions about that September stay, but Air Force Brig. Gen. Ed Thomas, the chief spokesman, told POLITICO in a statement that \u2018initial reviews indicate that aircrew transiting through Scotland adhered to all guidance and procedures.\u2019 He acknowledged, however, that U.S. service members \u2018lodging at higher-end accommodations, even if within government rates, might be allowable but not advisable. Therefore, we are reviewing all associated guidance.\u2019 Trump\u2019s own stays at his properties, most notably Mar-a-Lago, have previously raised concerns that he is trying to profit off his presidency. And the latest news from the Air Force will certainly only give House Democrats more fuel for their investigations into how Trump\u2019s businesses have benefited from his position. Trump is taking heat from all sides for announcing he had planned (and then canceled) secret peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar accused Trump of treating foreign policy like \u201csome kind of gameshow.\u201d And Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger dismissed the original plan as a horrible idea. The New York Times has more on how the talks came together \u2060\u2014 and fell apart: On the Friday before Labor Day, President Trump gathered top advisers in the Situation Room to consider what could be among the profound decisions of his presidency \u2014 a peace plan with the Taliban after 18 years of grinding, bloody war in Afghanistan. The meeting brought to a head a bristling conflict dividing his foreign policy team for months, pitting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo against John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, in a battle for the competing instincts of a president who relishes tough talk but promised to wind down America\u2019s endless wars. ... Mr. Trump made no decision on the spot, but at some point during the meeting the idea was floated to finalize the negotiations in Washington, a prospect that appealed to the president\u2019s penchant for dramatic spectacle. Mr. Trump suggested that he would even invite President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, whose government has not been party to the talks, and get him to sign on. In the days that followed, Mr. Trump came up with an even more remarkable idea \u2014 he would not only bring the Taliban to Washington, but to Camp David, the crown jewel of the American presidency. The leaders of a rugged militant organization deemed terrorists by the United States would be hosted in the mountain getaway used for presidents, prime ministers and kings just three days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that led to the Afghan war. Thus began an extraordinary few days of ad hoc diplomatic wrangling that upended the talks in a weekend Twitter storm. On display were all of the characteristic traits of the Trump presidency \u2014 the yearning ambition for the grand prize, the endless quest to achieve what no other president has achieved, the willingness to defy convention, the volatile mood swings and the tribal infighting. The targets of Trump\u2019s ire extend far beyond politics, even stretching to singer John Legend and his wife, model and Twitter favorite Chrissy Teigen. Trump signed the First Step Act, meant to reform the US criminal justice system, earlier this year at the urging of everyone from Jared Kushner to Kim Kardashian West. And apparently the president was irritated that a recent special on US prisons, hosted by NBC News anchor Lester Holt, failed to mention Trump\u2019s contribution to improving the system ... except that the program did mention it. Teigen had a characteristically, ahem, colorful response to the president. Good morning, live blog readers! Congress is back in session today, and leadership in both chambers has its hands full with questions surrounding potential gun legislation and impeachment inquiries. But Donald Trump has once again managed to snatch the spotlight by attacking his newest Republican primary challenger before tonight\u2019s campaign rally in North Carolina. The presidenton Twitter attacked Mark Sanford, less than a day after the former South Carolina governor and congressman announced he would challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Sanford lost his own congressional primary last year after Trump endorsed his opponent, who went on to lose her general election in the traditionally Republican district. Trump doesn\u2019t have much to sweat when it comes to his primary challenges. The Republican Party has done basically everything it can to clear the way for Trump\u2019s nomination. But the president\u2019s attack may say more about his concerns for a certain other Republican candidate. Trump will travel to North Carolina tonight to hold a rally for Dan Bishop, the Republican running in the special congressional race there. Despite Trump winning the GOP-leaning Ninth District by 11 points in 2016, the race has become a toss-up after the 2018 result was thrown out over allegations of election fraud. Trump cannot afford to lose North Carolina next year, and a defeat in this race could spell trouble. His attacks on his challengers, along with his repeated tweets endorsing Bishop, may signal he is more nervous than he wants to let on. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will award the Medal of Valor and Heroic Commendations before leaving for North Carolina. The acting commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol, Mark Morgan, will hold a White House press briefing at 12:30 p.m. E.T. Democratic lawmakers, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, will hold an event at at 3 p.m. E.T. to call on the Senate to take up the background checks bill that has already passed the House. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, is facing calls for his resignation after it was reported that he had threatened to fire senior staff at a federal agency unless they sided publicly with Donald Trump in the rumbling dispute dubbed \u201cSharpiegate\u201d. The New York Times, citing three anonymous officials, reported that Ross had called Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), last Friday and warned that heads would roll unless the agency\u2019s disagreement with the US president over the path of Hurricane Dorian was smoothed over. Earlier in the week, the agency\u2019s Birmingham, Alabama, office incurred Trump\u2019s wrath by publicly repudiating the president\u2019s false claim that Alabama was at risk from a devastating hurricane. By that point Alabama in fact lay outside the storm\u2019s likely trajectory. In a desperate effort to bolster Trump\u2019s inaccurate statement, a map of the hurricane\u2019s \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d was presented in the Oval Office that had been altered by Sharpie pen to extend the area of danger over a corner of Alabama. Hours after Ross\u2019s intervention, the Noaa put out an extraordinary official statement that sided with Trump and admonished its own Birmingham office. The news that a cabinet member in the Trump administration had threatened to fire politically-appointed staff at the agency in order to force the Noaa to contradict the advice of its own scientists prompted immediate condemnation. The head of the environmental group the Sierra Club, Michael Brune, called on Ross to resign to \u201cmaintain the dignity of the federal government\u201d. Brune called the intervention a \u201cshameless abuse of power\u201d that could have \u201cdevastating results now and in the future\u201d. Democratic congress members Don Beyer from Virginia and Paul Tonko from New York also called on Ross to step down. And late on Monday, the New York Times amended its story to report that the commerce department\u2019s own Office of Inspector General has launched an inquiry into that official statement and whether it breached departmental rules. That adds to an investigation initiated on Sunday by the Noaa\u2019s acting chief scientist, Craig McLean. He sent an email to colleagues announcing that he was looking into how the agency had come to disavow its own experts in backing Trump\u2019s inaccurate claim. The email, obtained by the Washington Post, called the agency\u2019s response \u201cpolitical\u201d and a \u201cdanger to public health and safety\u201d. The commerce secretary has denied that he threatened to fire staff. A statement made to the Hill called the New York Times story false and said: \u201cSecretary Ross did not threaten to fire any Noaa staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\u201d But the denial did little to quell the anxiety of top scientists at the Noaa who are dismayed that scientific findings made at the height of a severe public emergency should have been overridden in order to spare Trump\u2019s blushes. On Monday the director of the National Weather Service, Louis Uccellini, praised the agency\u2019s forecasters in Birmingham for having rebuffed Trump\u2019s false tweet in an effort to avoid public panic. \u201cThey did that with one thing in mind: public safety,\u201d Uccellini told a meeting of the National Weather Association.",

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April.

For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The report has been produced by the <a href=\"https://gca.org/global-commission-on-adaptation/adapt-our-world\">Global Commission on Adaptation</a> (GCA), convened by 18 nations including the UK. It has contributions from the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, environment ministers from China, India and Canada, the heads of the World Bank and the UN climate and environment divisions, and others.</p> \n<p>Among the most urgent actions recommended are early-warning systems of impending disasters, developing crops that can withstand droughts and restoring mangrove swamps to protect coastlines, while other measures include painting roofs of homes white to reduce heatwave temperatures.</p> \n<p>In the foreword to the report, Ban, Gates and Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank chief executive, write: \u201cThe climate crisis is here, now: massive wildfires ravage fragile habitats, city taps run dry, droughts scorch the land and massive floods destroy people\u2019s homes and livelihoods. So far the response has been gravely insufficient.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ban said: \u201cI am really concerned about the lack of vision of political leaders. They are much more interested in getting elected and re-elected, and climate issues are not in their priorities. We are seeing this in the US with President Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report says severe effects are now inevitable and estimates that unless precautions are taken, 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by 2030. It says the number of people short of water each year will jump by 1.4 billion to 5 billion, causing unprecedented competition for water, fuelling conflict and migration. On the coasts, rising sea levels and storms will drive hundreds of millions from their homes, with costs of $1tn (\u00a3810bn) a year by 2050.</p> \n<p>Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation, said: \u201cWhat we truly see is the risk of a climate apartheid, where the wealthy pay to escape and the rest are left to suffer. That is a very profound moral injustice.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the moral imperative alone will not drive change, he said, and the report also makes an economic case.</p> \n<p><strong>\u201c</strong>It is a nation\u2019s self-interest to invest in adaptation,\u201d Verkooijen said.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s readiness for the inevitable effects of the climate crisis is \u201cgravely insufficient\u201d, according to a report from global leaders. This lack of preparedness will result in poverty, water shortages and levels of migration soaring, with an \u201cirrefutable toll on human life\u201d, the report warns. Trillion-dollar investment is needed to avert \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d, where the rich escape the effects and the poor do not, but this investment is far smaller than the eventual cost of doing nothing. The study says the greatest obstacle is not money but a lack of \u201cpolitical leadership that shakes people out of their collective slumber\u201d. A \u201crevolution\u201d is needed in how the dangers of global heating are understood and planned for, and solutions are funded. The report has been produced by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA), convened by 18 nations including the UK. It has contributions from the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, environment ministers from China, India and Canada, the heads of the World Bank and the UN climate and environment divisions, and others. Among the most urgent actions recommended are early-warning systems of impending disasters, developing crops that can withstand droughts and restoring mangrove swamps to protect coastlines, while other measures include painting roofs of homes white to reduce heatwave temperatures. In the foreword to the report, Ban, Gates and Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank chief executive, write: \u201cThe climate crisis is here, now: massive wildfires ravage fragile habitats, city taps run dry, droughts scorch the land and massive floods destroy people\u2019s homes and livelihoods. So far the response has been gravely insufficient.\u201d Ban said: \u201cI am really concerned about the lack of vision of political leaders. They are much more interested in getting elected and re-elected, and climate issues are not in their priorities. We are seeing this in the US with President Trump.\u201d The report says severe effects are now inevitable and estimates that unless precautions are taken, 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by 2030. It says the number of people short of water each year will jump by 1.4 billion to 5 billion, causing unprecedented competition for water, fuelling conflict and migration. On the coasts, rising sea levels and storms will drive hundreds of millions from their homes, with costs of $1tn (\u00a3810bn) a year by 2050. Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation, said: \u201cWhat we truly see is the risk of a climate apartheid, where the wealthy pay to escape and the rest are left to suffer. That is a very profound moral injustice.\u201d But the moral imperative alone will not drive change, he said, and the report also makes an economic case. \u201cIt is a nation\u2019s self-interest to invest in adaptation,\u201d Verkooijen said. The report estimates spending $1.8tn by 2030 in five key areas could yield $7.1tn in net benefits, by avoiding damages and increasing economic growth. The chair of the UK\u2019s Environment Agency, Emma Howard Boyd, is a member of the GCA. The agency has warned England could run short of water within 25 years and increased coastal and river flooding may force some towns to be abandoned. In July, the UK government\u2019s official advisers said they were shocked at the lack of proper plans to protect people from the effects of the climate crisis. Bob Ward, the policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cAs one of the governments that commissioned this important GCA report, the UK must heed its conclusions about the large economic benefits from adapting to those impacts of climate change that cannot now be avoided. \u201cThis summer has shown that the UK is not adapted to the changing climate of this century, with heavier rainfall and more frequent and intense heatwaves. Successive environment ministers have failed to give this issue the attention it needs, leading to greater damage to lives and livelihoods.\u201d Cutting carbon emissions is vital, says the GCA report, but this has received nearly 20 times more funding than adaptation in recent years. Climate effects must be factored into decisions by those who make choices about the future, it says, such as business leaders. Verkooijen said nations should follow France in making it compulsory for large companies to report the climate risks to their businesses.
