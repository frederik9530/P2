Steve Smith, executive chef at Bohemia, said: \u201cThe team and I are incredibly proud to have ranked first in the Channel Islands for this year\u2019s guide. It\u2019s great to receive recognition for our hard work, and also fantastic that the Channel Islands has performed so well overall.\u201d Along with top restaurants, a number of up-and-coming \u201clocal gems\u201d can also be found on the islands, including No 10 Restaurant &amp; Bar in St Helier, hailed for cooking that is \u201cunostentatious yet ringing with exciting flavours and combinations\u201d. Amber Dalton, managing editor of the Waitrose Good Food Guide, said: \u201cThe arrival of No 10 Restaurant &amp; Bar is proof that, when it comes to eating out, the Channel Islands have not stood still. The Guide lists the very best places to dine across Britain, and with 16 Channel Islands restaurants included in the GFG, it\u2019s no surprise that they came out on top. We hope to see even more new entries from the Channel Islands next year.\u201d Also highlighted on the small island of Sark is Stocks \u2013 an oak-panelled dining room in a country hotel, which sources all its food from within a five-mile radius. The guide singles out Octopus on Guernsey \u2013 a seafood restaurant \u201cwith an all-day menu touting everything from fish and chips to tofu ramen\u201d. In second place on the guide\u2019s new regional list is Cornwall, home of Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, which notched up a perfect cooking score of 10 for the fourth year in a row, and local gems such as Blas Burgerworks \u2013 an eco-friendly burger bar on the harbour in St Ives. It is followed by Bristol at three, Somerset at four and Cumbria at five. In sixth place is Mid-Scotland and Fife, London and Wiltshire follow in seventh and eighth place, and Oxfordshire and mid-Wales complete the top 10 line-up. In the guide\u2019s top 50 restaurants, Cumbria\u2019s L\u2019Enclume and Core by Clare Smyth are in the sought-after first and second positions. The former, in the historic village of Cartmel, returns to the top spot this year, having previously graced the top of the best restaurant list in 2017\u2019s guide. Consultant editor Elizabeth Carter said: \u201cThere was very strong competition among the top-scoring restaurants this year, but there was no ignoring the fact that L\u2019Enclume is a really extraordinary restaurant. It dazzles; not with glitter-ball ritz and razzmatazz, but with the understated glow that comes from being indisputably world-class.\u201d For those on a budget, the guide also highlights more than 350 restaurants offering three-course dinners for \u00a330 or less. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 September 2019 to correct references in the text and headline to the Channel Islands being part of the UK.",

But oh dear, the downstairs staff are enraged when the monarch brings in his own royal servants who pull rank on them, while the formidable Countess of Grantham (Smith) is nettled to see that the Queen has brought her lady-in-waiting Lady Bagshaw (Staunton), a distant cousin with whom she has a serious beef. Also, some little silver knick-knacks around the house are going missing, and there\u2019s a mysterious military fellow who seems to have taken a room in a pub with a view overlooking where His Majesty will be standing on the village green.</p> <p>Exasperatingly, many of the plotlines \u2013 the central royal drama and the confrontation between Lady Grantham and Lady Bagshaw \u2013 are accelerated and resolved with almost surreal speed. But one which is emphasised is a new development in the life of the Downton franchise\u2019s gay character, Barrow, the footman-turned-butler played by Robert James-Collier, whose sexuality is acknowledged and even celebrated. However, I do have to point out that his new trance of love means that he simply isn\u2019t very good at his job and Mr Carson has to be brought out of retirement for butlering duties on the night of royal specialness. Meanwhile, Barrow disports himself at the kind of secret establishment which Mr Fellowes imagines existing in Yorkshire in the 1920s.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMkiSqBraD0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMkiSqBraD0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Basically, the plots are rickety and the characterisation has the depth of a Franklin Mint plate, but there are some funny moments and Kevin Doyle, playing the overexcitable servant Molesley, pretty much steals the entire film with his embarrassing outburst of royalist love and Downton pride over dinner. When the grand patrician company falls into a deathly hush and director Michael Engler goes in for a closeup on Molesley\u2019s aghast face, you\u2019d need a heart of stone not to laugh. Otherwise, there are sad and sombre moments, closing on a rousingly reactionary and entertainingly preposterous big-up for the country house culture: a note of finality to signal that this really is it now. Or is the franchise just beginning? You\u2019ve heard of Fast and Furious. We could be in for The Languid and Lugubrious: Downton 2.</p> <p>\u2022Released on 13 September in the UK, 19 September in Australia, and 20 September in the US.</p>",

But oh dear, the downstairs staff are enraged when the monarch brings in his own royal servants who pull rank on them, while the formidable Countess of Grantham (Smith) is nettled to see that the Queen has brought her lady-in-waiting Lady Bagshaw (Staunton), a distant cousin with whom she has a serious beef. Also, some little silver knick-knacks around the house are going missing, and there\u2019s a mysterious military fellow who seems to have taken a room in a pub with a view overlooking where His Majesty will be standing on the village green. Exasperatingly, many of the plotlines \u2013 the central royal drama and the confrontation between Lady Grantham and Lady Bagshaw \u2013 are accelerated and resolved with almost surreal speed. But one which is emphasised is a new development in the life of the Downton franchise\u2019s gay character, Barrow, the footman-turned-butler played by Robert James-Collier, whose sexuality is acknowledged and even celebrated. However, I do have to point out that his new trance of love means that he simply isn\u2019t very good at his job and Mr Carson has to be brought out of retirement for butlering duties on the night of royal specialness. Meanwhile, Barrow disports himself at the kind of secret establishment which Mr Fellowes imagines existing in Yorkshire in the 1920s. Basically, the plots are rickety and the characterisation has the depth of a Franklin Mint plate, but there are some funny moments and Kevin Doyle, playing the overexcitable servant Molesley, pretty much steals the entire film with his embarrassing outburst of royalist love and Downton pride over dinner. When the grand patrician company falls into a deathly hush and director Michael Engler goes in for a closeup on Molesley\u2019s aghast face, you\u2019d need a heart of stone not to laugh. Otherwise, there are sad and sombre moments, closing on a rousingly reactionary and entertainingly preposterous big-up for the country house culture: a note of finality to signal that this really is it now. Or is the franchise just beginning? You\u2019ve heard of Fast and Furious. We could be in for The Languid and Lugubrious: Downton 2. \u2022Released on 13 September in the UK, 19 September in Australia, and 20 September in the US.",

In the latest attempt to win public support for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance, the Treasury said travellers to and from the EU would see prices tumble as excise duties were removed. Under a no-deal Brexit, UK excise duty would no longer be due on alcohol and cigarettes bought when leaving Britain, the Treasury said, meaning a bottle of wine bought at Heathrow by a departing passenger would be up to \u00a32.23 cheaper. People returning from the EU would have the choice of continuing to purchase and bring home unlimited amounts of cigarettes and alcohol with duty paid \u2013 as is the case now \u2013 or to buy limited amounts at duty-free shops in EU countries instead. According to figures provided by the Treasury, someone buying two crates of beer would save \u00a312. Some estimates put the cost of the policy at \u00a3250m. In what will be seen as a fresh sign that the government is gearing up to fight a general election over the coming months, Javid said: \u201cAs we prepare to leave the EU, I\u2019m pleased to be able to back British travellers. \u201cWe want people to enjoy their hard-earned holidays and this decision will help holidaymakers\u2019 cash go that little bit further.\u201d The return of duty free will only apply if Britain leaves the EU without a deal because under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the UK would stay in the single market and the customs union for the duration of a transition period, and this means keeping the current system in place. At the end of that period, the UK would have to decide whether to remain aligned with EU rules on duty free but leaving without a deal gives the government the freedom to set its own rules. Ministers, who think the announcement is certain to be popular with the public, are keen to counter some of the negative stories surrounding a no-deal Brexit with examples of how consumers will see some tangible and immediate benefits. The travel industry has been calling on the government to reintroduce duty free, which stopped when the European single market was introduced. Duty-free shopping is already permitted for travellers going to non-EU countries. The Treasury said a consultation would also be launched soon on its long-term duty-free policy.",

Salvini\u2019s hardline immigration policy is expected to be revised under the new interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, a career civil servant and specialist in migration policy. The key economy minister role went to Roberto Gualtieri, a European parliamentarian with the PD. His first major challenge will be drafting Italy\u2019s budget for 2020. Negotiations over this year\u2019s budget between Rome and Brussels were so fractious that Italy was threatened with severe fines. But Salvini, whose League party is still the biggest in Italy despite losing some of its popularity in recent weeks, is refusing to renounce his push for fresh elections. He told protesters outside the lower house on Monday that they represented \u201cthe majority in the country asking for a vote\u201d. \u201cToday the division between the closed palace and the Italy in the street is evident,\u201d he said. Salvini, who constantly campaigned during his time in office, has held several rallies across Italy over the past week and has called for a demonstration to be held in Rome in October.",

He\u2019s done,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019d never been hit to the body the way he got hit to the body with Andy.\u201d Ruiz, meanwhile, vividly remembers the flurry of punches which sent Joshua to the canvas for a final time. \u201cThe funny thing is that in the seventh round all I could hear was my trainer screaming and my dad screaming: \u2018Do it for your kids!\u2019 he says, laughing. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Shut up! Calm down, I\u2019m doing it for the Cheerios!\u2019\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Elena Ferrante, the Italian author whose Neapolitan novels became a global phenomenon, is to publish a new book in Italy on 7 November \u2013 her first novel in four years. Ferrante\u2019s Italian publisher, Edizioni E/O, made the announcement with a terse tweet on Monday morning. Her English-language publisher, Europa Editions, followed suit, with a short extract indicating that the story was set in Naples. Neither publisher has revealed the new novel\u2019s title. Ferrante\u2019s four-part Neapolitan series, which began with My Brilliant Friend, told the story of the lifelong friendship and rivalry between two women who grew up in a poor neighbourhood in the southern Italian city. The second season of HBO\u2019s TV adaptation of the series, which will cover the second book of the quartet, is expected to be aired next year. Since the Neapolitan novels, Ferrante, who conceals her identity behind a pseudonym, has published one book, Incidental Inventions, a collection of columns that she wrote during her year-long collaboration with the Guardian. Ferrante\u2019s previous books include the Turin-based The Days of Abandonment and The Troubling Love. In 2016 the investigative journalist Claudo Gatti caused a storm in the literary world after claiming to unmask Ferrante as Anita Raja, a Rome-based translator who once helped run a publishing imprint of Italian writers. Gatti was criticised for a gross violation of the writer\u2019s privacy and some believed he would be blamed if Ferrante disappeared from public life. In interviews over the years, Ferrante suggested that her anonymity was a vital component of her work. Being unknown, she said, gave her the space and liberty to focus on her writing, free from the \u201canxiety of notoriety\u201d or the temptation to censor herself. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2019 because an earlier version misspelled Anita Raja\u2019s last name as Raga.

The drug-testing trial would take place in Logan (Queensland), Canterbury-Bankstown (NSW) and Mandurah (Western Australia), and new welfare recipients would be selected for testing at random. Those who fail a test would have 80% of their welfare benefits quarantined for two years using a controversial cashless debit card. In New Zealand, about 40,000 welfare recipients undergo drug tests each year as part of a similar scheme; consistently, less than 1% of those tested have recorded a positive test.

And a 77-year-old Briton has become the oldest person to sail around the world alone, non-stop, and unassisted. Jeanne Socrates completed the voyage in 320 days. Opinion and analysis It\u2019s official: the average standard variable home rate of 4.94% is the lowest recorded by the Reserve Bank. But, Greg Jericho asks, what if the record low rates fuel nothing but house prices? \u201cThe latest housing finance figures released by the ABS show that the slashing of the cash rate to 1.0% has had an immediate impact on home loans. But while this will likely lead to increased house prices, we are yet to see the rate cuts lead to any substantive improvement in actual economic activity. Given that, you can understand why the governor of the Reserve Bank might be hoping the government would lend a hand with infrastructure spending. At some point the government needs to realise the RBA cannot do it all.\u201d Critics have slammed plans to drug test people on Newstart. But what does the scheme involve? And what does the evidence say? Luke Henriques-Gomes has been asking the experts. The drug-testing trial would take place in Logan (Queensland), Canterbury-Bankstown (NSW) and Mandurah (Western Australia), and new welfare recipients would be selected for testing at random. Those who fail a test would have 80% of their welfare benefits quarantined for two years using a controversial cashless debit card. In New Zealand, about 40,000 welfare recipients undergo drug tests each year as part of a similar scheme; consistently, less than 1% of those tested have recorded a positive test. Ross Bell, the executive director of the New Zealand Drug Foundation, says the NZ policy is \u201call a bit silly\u201d. He thinks the Australian trial could be worse. Sport Michael Cheika has hinted at employing a \u201chorses-for-courses\u201d selection policy for the Wallabies at Rugby World Cup. The options for the Australia coach are seemingly limitless, but picking the right combinations is crucial. England have opted to defer any reboot of the Test team until after the final Ashes match. The urn has been secured by Tim Paine\u2019s tourists who are 2-1 up with one match to play. Thinking time: using maths to find love They say love is a numbers game, and Bobby Seagull is taking them literally. A few years ago, the mathematician sat down to try to work out why he had been unlucky. Inspired by Peter Backus \u2013 a Manchester University economics lecturer who in 2010 wrote a paper titled Why I Don\u2019t Have a Girlfriend \u2013 Seagull used the Drake equation, developed to estimate how many intelligent alien civilisations there might be in the galaxy, to determine his number of potential partners. \u201cYou start by assuming there\u2019s infinitely many, then you keep on making the pool smaller and smaller.\u201d Like the Drake equation, online dating can present you only with a pool of suitable partners you could potentially meet. Speaking to Elle Hunt, Seagull admits he has only been on seven or eight dates since doing the equation. Maybe his mum was right when, on seeing his formula, she told him he was being ridiculous, and \u201cto go out and meet people\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m terrible,\u201d he admits. \u201cI leave a long gap between dates. After a date, if you didn\u2019t have a good time, you feel despondent. I had another date, where I liked her and she didn\u2019t like me. As a human, you get upset. That\u2019s why scientists trust the maths: keep going.\u201d Media roundup Ten homes have been lost at Peregian Beach on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast, the ABC reports, and police have declared an emergency situation owing to the rapidly escalating bushfire threat. Residents from Sydney\u2019s cracked Mascot Towers have asked for the NSW government to help fund remediation works because a third of them can\u2019t afford to pay a special levy, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. And Asic has called out PwC over the quality of its auditing work, the Australian reports, after the regulator triggered a writedown of more than $500m at Myer. Coming up Parliament continues, with the Labor caucus meeting in the morning as well as meetings of cabinet and the Coalition party room.

Under Michael O\u2019Neill, they have made a habit of making life difficult and inflicting the odd upset or two, making light work of Norway and Czech Republic since reaching the round of 16 at the last Euros. Also in action are Scotland, where the mood is considerably gloomier given Steve Clarke\u2019s side have the unenviable task of entertaining, according to the Fifa rankings, the best nation on the planet. The grimmer news for Scotland? Belgium have won their past five meetings without conceding a goal. \u201cWe have to be defensively organised, but you also have to have a threat,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point thinking we can camp down for 97 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Avoiding defeat at Windsor Park would go some way to helping Northern Ireland secure a qualification spot ahead of the Netherlands, who overcame Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side last time out. \u201cWe are in a group of three with Holland and Germany, which is a nice play to be,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. A bout of flu has bogged down some of the German camp, with Ilkay G\u00fcndogan among those missing for what, on the face of it, is an intriguing tie. \u201cNorthern Ireland are amazingly robust, they play a lot of long balls,\u201d L\u00f6w said. \u201cThey will sit deeper and we will not have much space, so we need to think of something tactically.\u201d The captain, Manuel Neuer, added: \u201cIt is not ideal for us to be playing an away game in Belfast right now. They have won all their games so far and it is always difficult to score goals against such opponents.\u201d So, is there any stopping this Northern Ireland side? We will soon find out. <br></p> <h2>Monday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers</h2> <p><strong>Group C<br></strong>Estonia v Netherlands<br>Northern Ireland v Germany<br><strong><br>Group E<br></strong>Azerbaijan 1-1 Croatia (FT)<br>Hungary v Slovakia</p> <p><strong>Group G<br></strong>Latvia v Macedonia<br>Poland v Austria<br>Slovenia v Israel<br><br><strong>Group I<br></strong>Russia v Kazakhstan<br>San Marino v Cyprus<br>Scotland v Belgium</p> <h2>International friendlies</h2> <p>Wales v Belarus<br></p> <h2>Under-21 qualifiers</h2> <p>England v Kosovo</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T17:57:44.253Z\">at 6.57pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Bye! Read Julian Taylor\u2019s match report: Read Stuart James\u2019s match report: Some Northern Ireland reaction. \u201cI thought first half we gave a really good account of ourselves and in the second we weren\u2019t able to reach the same levels and we were punished for it,\u201d says the skipper, Steven Davis, the consummate professional. \u201cThey make you work so hard off the ball and the first goal is a great finish from the lad [Halstenberg] and it\u2019s uphill from there.\u201d Conor Washington says it\u2019s the best they have played against Germany in recent years. Read Ewan Murray\u2019s match report from Hampden Park: Not a bad night\u2019s work for Manchester City midfielders. Kevin de Bruyne knocked the stuffing out of Scotland with three assists and a nonchalant finish en route to a comprehensive 4-0 win in Glasgow to leave Steve Clarke\u2019s side staring down the barrel in terms of their Euro 2020 hopes, while Phil Foden scored twice for Aidy Boothrooyd\u2019s England Under-21s as two close-range strikes swept aside Kosovo. Group C Estonia 0-4 Netherlands Northern Ireland 0-2 Germany Group E Hungary 1-2 Slovakia Group G Latvia 0-2 Macedonia Poland 0-0 Austria Slovenia 3-2 Israel Group I Russia 1-0 Kazakhstan San Marino 0-4 Cyprus Scotland 0-4 Belgium International friendlies Wales 1-0 Belarus Under-21 qualifiers England 2-0 Kosovo A sublime finish 60 seconds from time. A beautifully crafted goal, with the substitute Kai Havertz supplying Serge Gnabry, who races on to a slipped pass ahead of Craig Cathcart and the forward slides the ball through the legs of Bailey Peacock-Farrell. A cheeky finish to round off a good night for Germany in Belfast. That\u2019s Gnabry\u2019s fifth strike in as five games. 90 min: There will be three added minutes in Belfast. Can Northern Ireland dig deep down the back of the sofa and find an equaliser? Down in Cardiff, where Will Vaulks and Chris Gunter have been thrown on, Wales are heading for a 1-0 friendly win over Belarus. England Under-21s still lead Kosovo 1-0 ... 87 min: The Netherlands hit four goals \u2013 again! Georginio Wijnaldum, who added his side\u2019s fourth against Germany on Friday, is at it again. Ronald Koeman\u2019s men are cruising in Tallinn, where Estonia now trail 4-0 in Group C. And there has been a big goal in Group I, to compound a chastening evening for Scotland as Russia take a late, late lead at home to Kazakhstan. 85 min: Emre Can is on for Marco Reus in Belfast. Presumably, Germany are going to try and shut up shop. Lavery is on for Northern Ireland, zipping around the field as Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s seek to find an equaliser. Can his side find one? There it is. Three assists and an effortless finish. Just another day\u2019s work for the Manchester City man. He\u2019s torn Scotland to shreds. 80 min: Michael O\u2019Neill is readying Shayne Lavery, the 20-year-old Linfield striker. He will get a rapturous reception. Surely Washington will make way \u2013 or will the manager be tempted to go for broke and play with three strikers. Lavery has scored five goals in his last four games. Northern Ireland are still plugging away. 77 min: Memphis Depay adds a third for the Netherlands in Estonia! Ronald Koeman\u2019s side lead 3-0, with Ryan Babel at the double. A couple of personnel changes in the Scotland game as Steve Clarke turns to Johnny Russell up front, while Belgium introduce Yannick Carrasco in place of Nacer Chadli for the final stages. 75 min: A couple of changes for Wales. Tom Lockyer, the Charlton defender formerly of Bristol Rovers, replaces Chris Mepham, while Sam Vokes is on for the debutant Kieffer Moore. Ryan Giggs\u2019s side remain a goal to the good against Belarus. Elsewhere, Todd Cantwell and Mason Greenwood are on for England\u2019s Under-21s up at Hull. England lead Kosovo 1-0 there. 73 min: Germany knock the ball around before floating a ball into the overlapping Klostermann from deep. The full-back reaches it but cannot get any conviction on his cross and the move peters out. Meanwhile, Kevin de Bruyne almost helps himself to a deserved goal after a neat one-two with Mertens. 72 min: Tah makes a strong block on Paddy McNair \u2013 but Northern Ireland earn a corner. The hosts recycle the ball with Dallas looping a ball into the box but Magennis is offside. In Glasgow, Stuart Armstrong is on for Callum McGregor. 70 min: Michael O\u2019Neill is going for it. The Northern Ireland manager introduces the forward Josh Magennis in place of midfielder George Saville. 68 min: Chance! A Germany change, as Kai Havertz replaces Timo Werner. And the substitute almost makes an immediate impact, with the forward nodding just wide after meeting a wonderful ball into the box by Kimmich. 65 min: Scotland are plodding on but they have nothing to show for their efforts. Well, Scott McTominay has a yellow card that rules him out of a trip to Russia. He picked up the caution for a clumsy challenge on Dries Mertens. Back in Belfast, the turbocharged Whyte is causing a major headache for Germany\u2019s back line. 63 min: Gavin Whyte has been electric since coming on! The winger has Halstenberg, the Germany goalscorer, on toast, putting on the afterburners down the right flank and leaving the left-back for dead. He bursts to the byline and lays the ball off for Dallas, who sends a rasping effort just wide of a post. That run alone has turned the volume up inside an absolutely rocking Windsor Park. 61 min: McNair goes over theatrically in the box \u2013 and Northern Ireland are adamant it\u2019s a penalty! There did seem to be a smidgen of contact, with Toni Kroos swiping at the midfielder. But nothing doing says the referee Orsati, who did seem to put the whistle to his mouth before seemingly changing his mind at the last second. Whyte, the substitute, played a cute reverse pass into the box for Paddy McNair, who strode forward before going over under pressure from Kroos. 59 min: O\u2019Neill rolls the dice as Cardiff winger Gavin Whyte replaces Niall McGinn. In the Welsh capital, a notable change: Gareth Bale is on for Daniel James, who has had another good day at the office. Half an hour, then, for the Real Madrid forward. 55 min: Reus calls Peacock-Farrell into another smart stop! Saville is booked for a foul 25 yards out and Germany almost make the hosts pay in Belfast. Reus wraps his right foot around the ball and Peacock scampers across goal to keep it out. Elsewhere, the Netherlands have doubled their lead in Estonia. Usually drink, usually dance ... usually Babel. Slovakia have re-taken the lead against Hungary. It\u2019s 2-1 in Budapest. Elsewhere, Slovenia 1-1 Israel and San Marino trail Cyprus 2-0. 53 min: Another superb save by Peacock-Farrell! The Northern Ireland goalkeeper gets down low to his left to keep out a drive by Timo Werner, who was beautifully laid off by Marco Reus. Northern Ireland look a little startled and the hosts need to steady the ship here. Germany have certainly upped the ante since the interval. 52 min: Serge Gnabry is causing all sorts of problems! Michael O\u2019Neill needs to find a solution and fast. The forward is drifting inside and no one is picking him up. As Germany pour forward once more, the former Arsenal man sends a shot just past a post. They are ratcheting through the gears now. Germany silence Belfast. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as Gnabry dances through the spine of the absent Northern Ireland midfield, the ball breaks wide this time to the right, where Klostermann spins a ball in towards the back post. Marcel Halstenberg picks it up, with Stuart Dallas caught in no man\u2019s land and the left-back hammers a volley across goal and beyond Peacock-Farrell. Sweet finish. 47 min: Northern Ireland are on the ropes \u2013 but Bailey Peacock-Farrell comes up trumps once again! Germany surge forward through Gnabry, the ball is switched from left to right, to an unmarked Klostermann, who drills low and hard at goal. But Peacock-Farrell saves well down to his right to deny the full-back. Peacock-Farrell has not played a minute of club football since joining Burnley from Leeds in the summer but he has had to be very alert this evening. 46 min: We\u2019re back under way around the grounds! \u201cI tell you what,\u201d starts Dean Kinsella on email, \u201cthis is a very fine Northern Ireland team. Full of vim and no little skill. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they get a result tonight.\u201d No changes at the interval. Half-time listening: A Kevin de Bruyne masterclass is in full flow at Hampden Park, where Scotland cannot get near the Belgium and Manchester City midfielder. \u201cCan I claim fantasy football points for De Bruyne today?\u201d politely asks J.R in Illinois. \u201cThat\u2019s three assists in the first 32 minutes \u2013 dude\u2019s a machine.\u201d It is far from doom and gloom in Belfast, with Northern Ireland more than holding their own against Germany. Conor Washington has spurned two golden chances, while Bailey Peacock-Farrell made a smart stop to prevent Timo Werner from the opening the scoring. Germany felt aggrieved at the referee Daniele Orsato waving away penalty appeals after Jonny Evans appeared to handle in the box. Elsewhere, England Under-21s lead Kosovo courtesy of a Phil Foden strike, with the teenager slotting home after Steven Sessegnon\u2019s shot was cleared. Euro 2020 qualifiers Group C Estonia 0-1 Netherlands Northern Ireland 0-0 Germany Group E Hungary 0-1 Slovakia Group G Latvia 0-2 Macedonia Poland 0-0 Austria Slovenia 1-0 Israel Group I Russia v Kazakhstan San Marino 0-2 Cyprus Scotland 0-3 Belgium International friendlies Wales 1-0 Belarus Under-21 qualifiers England 1-0 Kosovo 45+1 min: Peacock-Farrell makes a massive save to deny Werner! Just as it seemed Northern Ireland would lead, their goalkeeper keeps them in it to prevent Germany from stealing the lead. Jamal Lewis switched off and Klostermann laid the ball on a plate for Werner but Peacock-Farrell saves with his legs. A crucial stop by the Burnley goalkeeper, who joined from Leeds in the summer. 45 min: Somehow Germany survive! Neuer eventually smothers the ball! After a neat one-two between Dallas and Corry Evans, the latter sends a rasping cross into the front post from the right flank. Jonathan Tah is first on the scene, diving in to make life difficult for Conor Washington, who simply does not react quick enough. Neuer gets a second bite of the cherry, and this time the Germany goalkeeper clutches it. Germany are quick on the counter ... 42 min: Toni Kroos and George Saville get in to a brief shouting match \u2013 but that\u2019s that. It all stemmed from Paddy McNair leaving a bit on Kroos, with the referee booking the midfielder for standing on the Real Madrid man. Meanwhile, a change: Jonathan Tah is on to replace the injured Mathias Ginter. 38 min: Thomas Meunier fires against the side netting! More magic from Kevin de Bruyne, who slips in a cute ball to the back stick. In Belfast, Northern Ireland keep plugging away, with Steven Davis, Corry Evans and co chasing every loose ball and lost cause. It\u2019s absolutely bouncing in the stands. It had been coming \u2013 and make that three assists for the majestic Kevin de Bruyne. It is the first time since 1979 that Scotland have conceded three first-half goals on home soil, also against Belgium. Steve Clarke\u2019s stoney face tells a thousand words. The atmosphere is desperately flat at Hampden, in stark contrast to Windsor Park, where Northern Ireland supporters are cheering every tackle with great gusto. Germany have been in the ascendency, though. 31 min: A couple of near-misses! At Hampden, Youri Tielemans drops a shot inches wide of a post. In Cardiff, Kieffer Moore almost helps himself to a goal on his debut but Belarus nip in to prevent the Wigan striker from doubling Wales\u2019s lead. 29 min: Cathcart nods clear as Germany attempt to find Brandt. Northern Ireland are having to sustain a hefty spell of pressure. Elsewhere, Ryan Babel\u2019s goal has given the Netherlands the lead in Estonia, while Macedonia lead Latvia 2-0. Ah, drat. De Bruyne tees up Thomas Vermaelen. It is another peach of an assist by the Manchester City midfielder collects a short corner and promptly fires a wonderful whipped ball in towards the back post, where Belgium are queuing up. Vermaelen simply side-foots home into the roof David Marshall\u2019s goal. 21 min: Northern Ireland appear to get away with one, as Julian Brandt\u2019s strike hits Jonny Evans left hand inside the box. Evans shrieked in fear and Germany are up in arms about it but the hosts get off the hook. A heroic block by George Saville leads to the Middlesbrough midfielder needing some treatment but he\u2019s soon back up on his feet. Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side are certainly growing into the game, with his side beginning to stretch Northern Ireland and make them work a little harder defensively. Another beauty by the Manchester United winger. A wry Gareth Bale smile says it all. Once again, the 21-year-old jinks in from the left on to his right foot and finds the corner. James is a man in form, that his fourth goal in six games this season. 18 min: Jonny Evans dallies on possession on halfway and Timo Werner robs the centre-back and storms forward. Werner looks up and tries to pick out Serge Gnabry but Craig Cathcart bails out his team-mate and wellies the ball clear. The resulting corner comes to nothing as Cathcart hoofs clear once more. Northern Ireland are more than holding their own against Germany on home turf. 17 min: Lukaku has bagged 32 goals for Belgium since August 2016. What\u2019s more, he has scored four goals in his three international appearances against Scotland, finding the net with four of his five shots on target. Not bad going, eh? Scotland appear to have dusted themselves down, with Robert Snodgrass curling in a dangerous ball but it\u2019s comfortably cleared by Toby Alderweireld. 12 min: Manuel Neuer has been much the busier goalkeeper in Belfast, with a McNair free-kick forcing the Bayern Munich man to punch clear. In Scotland, they need to recover from an early setback. It was a killer counterattack by Belgium, just as their manager predicted. De Bruyne is released down the left flank and he runs and runs before picking out Lukaku at the opportune moment. The rest is history as Lukaku \u2013 first time \u2013 finds the net. After an encouraging start, Romelu Lukaku slots home. 6 min: Neuer denies Washington! Toni Kroos is harried superbly by Corry Evans, who blocks the midfielder\u2019s attempted pass, which cannons into the striker\u2019s path. Washington is inadvertently released one v one but the Germany goalkeeper is quick off his line and makes a strong left-handed save. His giant frame makes life difficult for the striker, whose effort was swiftly repelled. Germany go up the other end through Timo Werner but he fluffs his lines. 5 min: Conor Washington stabs the ball goalwards, which is enough to earn a big, hearty gasp from the Northern Ireland supporters. It stemmed from Stuart Dallas\u2019s long throw from the right flank causing a bit of mayhem in the Germany 18-yard box and Washington endeavoured to keep it alive. No real scare for Manuel Neuer, but something for the hosts to take plenty of confidence from nevertheless. 3 min: Windsor Park is absolutely rocking. Paddy McNair wins an early corner but Germany wallop the ball clear. Jonny Evans earlier halted a Germany attack almost direct from kick-off. The Scots have started quickly at Hampden, with the kind of tempo that will please Steve Clarke and those supporters alike. And, just like that, we\u2019re off. At Hampden, Manchester City again get the better of Liverpool, with Kevin de Bruyne wining the coin toss against Andy Robertson. The teams trudge out of the tunnel at Hampden Park, and likewise in Belfast, Cardiff and ... Hull, where England Under-21s are in action. We are just the national anthems away from the off. Ooh, and a gentle reminder that the former Scotland forward Shaun Maloney is on Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s backroom staff. \u201cAs a player I loved the Scotland national anthem and lining up for it \u2014 I still do,\u201d Maloney, who was capped 47 times by his country, said. \u201cBut it is about staying focused and appreciating I am being paid for a certain job. I am working for Belgium so I think you have to respect both, but I do especially have to remember I am here to work.\u201d Mart\u00ednez has also been gushing about Romelu Lukaku before kick-off \u2013 and with good reason: no player has scored more international goals for their country than the 31 he has managed since August 2016, dwarfing the tallies of Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Lewandowski and Harry Kane, among others. Of the Inter forward, his manager says: \u201cAt the age of 26, to have that amount of goals at international level and club level shows you how good a goalscorer he is. He brings something a little bit different, he can use the pace and power to bring a different physicality to his play. It\u2019s important he\u2019s back and fully fit to start the season.\u201d Roberto Mart\u00ednez talks pre-match. \u201cI think it will be a typical British game, very dynamic, I think the counterattack will be a big part of what the teams can do,\u201d the Belgium manager says. \u201cSteve Clarke is trying to build a real strong defensive unit and they will have good quality with the arrival of [Robert] Snodgrass, [Callum] McGregor, [Ryan] Chrisite \u2013 technical footballers. It\u2019s a game that I expect a lot of physicality. It\u2019s a great opportunity to get the three points and probably \u2013 not mathematically \u2013 but virtually qualify for the European Championships. Scotland still have an option of the play-off and they have a chance to carry on until the end with a push for qualification. The importance is the same for both sides.\u201d Fresh from a pre-match cuppa, Michael O\u2019Neill says he has tried to inject as much vim into his team as possible. There is certainly legs in his side, with Jamal Lewis, whose mother is an athletics coach, a talented cross-country and 800m runner in his teens, while Steven Davis, Paddy McNair and George Saville offer no end of midfield bite. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to put as much pace in the team as we can \u2013 Stuart Dallas has been playing at right-back for Leeds all season,\u201d he says. \u201cWe expect Germany to have a back four. We have to match them, the key in this game is to stay in the game for as long as possible. We have to play our own game and hurt them.\u201d Recap last night\u2019s scores on the doors: Steve Clarke suggested he would freshen things up, and the Scotland manager has done just that. McGinn, who scored on Friday, James Forrest, Fraser and McBurnie all drop out, with Matt Phillips, Ryan Christie, Kenny McLean and Robert Snodgrass all coming into the starting lineup. Christie has scored eight goals this season, though none since 13 August and Phillips has scored a couple of times for West Bromwich Albion in the Championship. Belgium, meanwhile, boast Romelu Lukaku and Kevin de Bruyne, with Origi and Batshuayi among those on the bench. Team news news: Oli McBurnie, John McGinn and Ryan Fraser are among those to drop out for Scotland, as Steve Clarke makes four changes, replacing his entire frontline from the defeat at home to Russia. That seems quite a ballsy move. No Hazards for Belgium, with Thorgan and Eden both injured. Northern Ireland make eight changes from their friendly win, with Jamal Lewis among those to start, while Germany name the same XI that were soundly beaten by the Netherlands in Hamburg. In Wales, Gareth Bale is on the bench as Ryan Giggs hands debuts to Kieffer Moore, the former Truro City striker, and Joe Morrell, the Bristol City midfielder on loan at Lincoln City. In terms of England Under-21s, Aidy Boothroyd sticks with Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson, who did the damage in Turkey last week.

Under Michael O\u2019Neill, they have made a habit of making life difficult and inflicting the odd upset or two, making light work of Norway and Czech Republic since reaching the round of 16 at the last Euros. Also in action are Scotland, where the mood is considerably gloomier given Steve Clarke\u2019s side have the unenviable task of entertaining, according to the Fifa rankings, the best nation on the planet. The grimmer news for Scotland? Belgium have won their past five meetings without conceding a goal. \u201cWe have to be defensively organised, but you also have to have a threat,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point thinking we can camp down for 97 minutes.\u201d Avoiding defeat at Windsor Park would go some way to helping Northern Ireland secure a qualification spot ahead of the Netherlands, who overcame Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side last time out. \u201cWe are in a group of three with Holland and Germany, which is a nice play to be,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. A bout of flu has bogged down some of the German camp, with Ilkay G\u00fcndogan among those missing for what, on the face of it, is an intriguing tie. \u201cNorthern Ireland are amazingly robust, they play a lot of long balls,\u201d L\u00f6w said. \u201cThey will sit deeper and we will not have much space, so we need to think of something tactically.\u201d The captain, Manuel Neuer, added: \u201cIt is not ideal for us to be playing an away game in Belfast right now. They have won all their games so far and it is always difficult to score goals against such opponents.\u201d So, is there any stopping this Northern Ireland side? We will soon find out.

Worse was to follow for Clarke before the interval. Charlie Mulgrew made a hash of trying to head a De Bruyne corner away, a situation that played out perfectly for Toby Alderweireld. The defender\u2019s header bounced in, via the crossbar, with the assistant referee due credit for the perfect call in awarding the goal. Thirty two minutes in, it was a question of how many Belgium felt like scoring. Scotland were not even competitive. A terrific Marshall save prevented Mertens from adding Belgium\u2019s fourth within two minutes of the re-start. Embarrassment followed for O\u2019Donnell as he incurred a booking for a penalty area dive with only Vermaelen in close proximity. De Bruyne got the goal his showing fully deserved, a first-time, curled finish after collection of a Lukaku pass. \u201cTo keep a clean sheet pleases me more than anything,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez. This somehow implied it was ever in doubt.",

      "bodyText": "Labour MP Diana Johnson has vowed to challenge party rules that have led to her facing a reselection battle before the next general election. At a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party in Westminster she told senior party figures she would fight the \u201ctrigger ballot\u201d process after local activists voted to try to find a new candidate for the Hull North seat. New party rules mean a selection contest can be triggered if a third of local Labour branches vote in favour. She is understood to have said: \u201cIt\u2019s a new procedure and I\u2019m the first one that\u2019s affected.\u201d She added that she was \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that she would challenge it by appealing to Labour\u2019s national executive committee. Johnson, who is not known as an outspoken critic of the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, told the meeting it was unfair that separate branch votes were counted in the same way. She claimed one branch that voted for her to face a challenge, had just two members present, while another in favour of her remaining as MP had 78 people there. Rules were changed at last year\u2019s party conference to make the threshold lower to trigger a selection process from 50% of local branches to a third. Other female MPs told the meeting how they were deeply concerned the new process might affect women and ethnic minorities disproportionately. Favoured \u201csons and daughters\u201d of Corbyn\u2019s leadership might find it easier to run in seats across the country even if they do not have a connection to the area, one MP complained. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of suspicion up and down the country that candidates will be imposed and it will be favoured sons and favoured daughters and not people from a local area,\u201d one MP said after the meeting. \u201cAlso a general election could be imminent and we should be focused on that rather than colleagues having to face trigger ballots. Diana is a brilliant MP, one of the best.\u201d \u201cAll this plays into the opposition\u2019s hands of us looking divided internally.\u201d Colleagues close to Corbyn allegedly told the meeting that the trigger ballot process was fair.

      "body": "<p>It was all too much for Sally Bercow. After more than an hour spent sitting listening to MPs eulogise her husband and no sign of anyone letting up, the Speaker\u2019s wife slipped out of the Commons gallery. Things to do, places to go. She\u2019d heard it all before. Most frequently from him.</p> \n<p>The lovefest had begun as a series of points of order, immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october\">Speaker had announced his intention to stand down at the end of parliamentary proceedings on 31 October</a> \u2013 a statement that had not been well received on the government benches. Partly because it was clear John Bercow was planning on going out on a personal high by working flat out to prevent Boris Johnson from disobeying the law by taking the UK out of the EU with a no-deal Brexit. But mainly because the Tories\u2019 own cunning plan to remove the Speaker by breaking with convention and putting up a candidate against him at the next election was now toast. Classic Dom.</p> \n<p>After Bercow had eventually wound to a close \u2013 even the most verbose and lachrymose statements must come to an end \u2013 every member of the opposition parties and a handful of Tory MPs rose to applaud him. The government front bench looked as if it was about to throw up. Jeremy Corbyn was first on his feet to thank the Speaker and praise him for his services to democracy. Something that Michael Gove then echoed. Not because he meant it, but because he thought it would look bad if no minister said anything. There are few better at duplicity and insincerity than Gove.</p> \n<p>A couple of Tories from Bercow\u2019s neighbouring constituencies in Buckinghamshire gave rather more genuine tributes, but otherwise the love came only from the opposition benches. The Speaker was praised for his championing of backbenchers, for standing up for the rights of parliament, for holding the government to account, and for his work promoting women and race equalities in parliament. All of which were true and heartfelt, though for some reason, no one chose to mention the allegations against him of abuse and bullying. Perhaps they just forgot in the heat of the moment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e4f00be8-933e-477d-9943-a54330de52a6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p0yNaF1grZI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bercow looked slightly disappointed that the tributes had only taken up 90 minutes of an already crowded day, but contented himself with the knowledge that this had really only been a dress rehearsal. When he actually does stand down at the end of October, Bercow will be sure to set aside several days for MPs to express their adoration more formally. The Long Goodbye to the Speaker is one of the few parliamentary traditions about which he has no reservations.</p> \n<p>With the wonders of his politeness and courtesy still ringing in his ears, Bercow wasted no time in shouting down two junior ministers, James Duddridge and Graham Stuart, who were objecting to him granting emergency debates and a humble address, to Dominic Grieve and Corbyn. Bercow was going to enjoy every minute of the time he had left.</p> \n<p>Both emergency debates covered much the same ground \u2013 namely that the government could no longer be trusted to do even the most simple tasks. It had lied about the reasons for the unprecedented five-week prorogation that was due to begin later that night. It had lied about the details and timing of its no-deal preparations. And it was now already threatening to ignore the bill, on which the royal assent was barely dry, insisting that the government ask the EU for an extension if no deal had been agreed.</p> \n<p>Grieve, Corbyn and Kier Starmer were all forensic and damning in their judgments. The closest to a defence the government could muster was Owen Paterson arguing that Dominic Cummings was just a political ingenue; someone with no experience of how government operated and who couldn\u2019t be expected to have his personal emails saying, \u201cSod the constitution, I\u2019ll do what I fucking like, you fucking fuck\u201d taken personally.</p> \n<p>It was just another humiliation in a day of humiliations for Boris Johnson. Just a few weeks ago, he\u2019d been mistaken for a statesman of substance in his meetings with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. In his press conference with Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, he had been exposed as a weak, incompetent, deceitful fraud. A prime minister so desperate for power he is not even trusted by his family or friends. A man of such needy narcissism that he can only say what he thinks his audience wants to hear and is crushed under his own contradictions.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/mps-order-johnson-to-hand-over-aides-messages-about-prorogation\">His defeat in the Grieve humble address was his fifth</a>. One more was to come before the night was out. History in the making. Johnson had gambled and failed abjectly. He had imagined prorogation and a general election as a brilliant play. His finest hour. Instead he was only further diminished. Hubris, thy name is Boris. Classic Dom.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was all too much for Sally Bercow. After more than an hour spent sitting listening to MPs eulogise her husband and no sign of anyone letting up, the Speaker\u2019s wife slipped out of the Commons gallery. Things to do, places to go. She\u2019d heard it all before. Most frequently from him. The lovefest had begun as a series of points of order, immediately after the Speaker had announced his intention to stand down at the end of parliamentary proceedings on 31 October \u2013 a statement that had not been well received on the government benches. Partly because it was clear John Bercow was planning on going out on a personal high by working flat out to prevent Boris Johnson from disobeying the law by taking the UK out of the EU with a no-deal Brexit. But mainly because the Tories\u2019 own cunning plan to remove the Speaker by breaking with convention and putting up a candidate against him at the next election was now toast. Classic Dom. After Bercow had eventually wound to a close \u2013 even the most verbose and lachrymose statements must come to an end \u2013 every member of the opposition parties and a handful of Tory MPs rose to applaud him. The government front bench looked as if it was about to throw up. Jeremy Corbyn was first on his feet to thank the Speaker and praise him for his services to democracy. Something that Michael Gove then echoed. Not because he meant it, but because he thought it would look bad if no minister said anything. There are few better at duplicity and insincerity than Gove. A couple of Tories from Bercow\u2019s neighbouring constituencies in Buckinghamshire gave rather more genuine tributes, but otherwise the love came only from the opposition benches. The Speaker was praised for his championing of backbenchers, for standing up for the rights of parliament, for holding the government to account, and for his work promoting women and race equalities in parliament. All of which were true and heartfelt, though for some reason, no one chose to mention the allegations against him of abuse and bullying. Perhaps they just forgot in the heat of the moment. Bercow looked slightly disappointed that the tributes had only taken up 90 minutes of an already crowded day, but contented himself with the knowledge that this had really only been a dress rehearsal. When he actually does stand down at the end of October, Bercow will be sure to set aside several days for MPs to express their adoration more formally. The Long Goodbye to the Speaker is one of the few parliamentary traditions about which he has no reservations. With the wonders of his politeness and courtesy still ringing in his ears, Bercow wasted no time in shouting down two junior ministers, James Duddridge and Graham Stuart, who were objecting to him granting emergency debates and a humble address, to Dominic Grieve and Corbyn. Bercow was going to enjoy every minute of the time he had left. Both emergency debates covered much the same ground \u2013 namely that the government could no longer be trusted to do even the most simple tasks. It had lied about the reasons for the unprecedented five-week prorogation that was due to begin later that night. It had lied about the details and timing of its no-deal preparations. And it was now already threatening to ignore the bill, on which the royal assent was barely dry, insisting that the government ask the EU for an extension if no deal had been agreed. Grieve, Corbyn and Kier Starmer were all forensic and damning in their judgments. The closest to a defence the government could muster was Owen Paterson arguing that Dominic Cummings was just a political ingenue; someone with no experience of how government operated and who couldn\u2019t be expected to have his personal emails saying, \u201cSod the constitution, I\u2019ll do what I fucking like, you fucking fuck\u201d taken personally. It was just another humiliation in a day of humiliations for Boris Johnson. Just a few weeks ago, he\u2019d been mistaken for a statesman of substance in his meetings with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. In his press conference with Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, he had been exposed as a weak, incompetent, deceitful fraud. A prime minister so desperate for power he is not even trusted by his family or friends. A man of such needy narcissism that he can only say what he thinks his audience wants to hear and is crushed under his own contradictions. His defeat in the Grieve humble address was his fifth. One more was to come before the night was out. History in the making. Johnson had gambled and failed abjectly. He had imagined prorogation and a general election as a brilliant play. His finest hour. Instead he was only further diminished. Hubris, thy name is Boris. Classic Dom.",

      "bodyText": "A deliveryman in New York has been accused of stealing $90,000 worth of cake. David Lliviganay, an employee of Lady M Confections, is said to have smuggled 1,020 of their cakes out of their Long Island City warehouse on dozens of occasions over the course of a few months. The confections, like their popular Rabbit Stamp Signature Mille Cr\u00eapes, retail for $90 apiece, and have been raved about by the likes of Martha Stewart and Oprah. The New York Times Magazine once called that item in particular \u201cat least the second-best cake in the city\u201d. Much like with any other high-priced luxury item, there was apparently a robust secondary black market for cr\u00eapes with little rabbits on them, a market opportunity that Lliviganay is alleged to have jumped on, according to a lawsuit filed by the company. Lliviganay, who has pleaded guilty to petit larceny according to the New York Post, was captured on surveillance cameras walking in and out of warehouse freezers multiple times, smuggling the cakes in bags to his waiting car. The company said they did not notice the cakes had gone missing until they were made aware of them being sold for a discount outside of their normal business operations. \u201cLady M takes great responsibility and pride when shipping our cakes to you,\u201d the company says on its website. \u201cEvery order is hand-packed and handled with care so that it will arrive to your door in mint condition.\u201d \u201cLady M is not responsible for lost or stolen packages,\u201d they note. The company is seeking a return on the value of the purloined cakes, plus interest, and punitive damages.",

Giving evidence to the defence select committee on Monday, Mordaunt said she believed the Cobra system had become \u201chollowed out\u201d under May \u2013 but despite that, it was necessary to hold a \u201cgranular meeting where we thrashed those issues out\u201d. Cobra meetings, named after the room in the Cabinet Office which they are held, are convened to discuss specific crises. Mordaunt said she believed the system had become less well-resourced than it had been when she was a junior minister under David Cameron\u2019s premiership. \u201cThere was a great difference in my experience of the Cobra set up between my time as minister for the armed forces and my time as secretary of state. It had been hollowed out.\u201d Later she added: \u201cThe backroom operation was not there.\u201d Mordaunt\u2019s fourth request \u2013 made on 19 June \u2013 was rejected again, this time in writing. An official letter she received said: \u201cThe decision to call a ministerial Cobra is for the PM; events to date have been judged not to warrant this.\u201d That came after four oil tankers were attacked near the strait of Hormuz on 12 May, and two other tankers were sabotaged by limpet mines on 13 June. The US and UK blamed Iran for the incidents, although Tehran denied responsibility. Tensions continued to escalate, with US President Donald Trump coming within minutes of launching an airstrike on Iran on 21 June, in retaliation for the downing of a American drone a few days earlier. Mordaunt said that she asked May again, and a Cobra meeting was finally convened on 10 July \u2013 six days after an Iranian oil tanker, the Grace 1, had been seized by Royal Marines when it passed through Gibraltar \u2013 but before a British flagged ship, the Stena Impero, was taken by Iran on 19 July. The former defence secretary, who was only in post 85 days before she was sacked by Boris Johnson when he became prime minister, was giving evidence to a defence select committee inquiry into the Gulf shipping crisis. MPs on the committee expressed surprise that it had taken so long to convene a Cobra meeting. The Stena Impero and its 23 crew were successfully seized by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards following a mix-up over its location, Mordaunt said. The vessel did not take the course it had said it would, meaning that navy patrol ship the HMS Montrose was too far away to protect it. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Royal Navy or the MoD dropped the ball,\u201d Mordaunt added.",

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.<br></p>\n    <p>At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms.

It was not clear if the traces were remnants of material that predate the landmark 2015 deal.</p> \n<p>Monday\u2019s announcement also comes as world powers have expressed interest in a renewed dialogue with Iran, something Netanyahu sees as counterproductive.

      "bodyText": "Benjamin Netanyahu has unveiled what he claims was a previously undisclosed Iranian nuclear weapons facility and accused Tehran of destroying the site to hide the evidence. \u201cThis is what I have to say to the tyrants of Tehran,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cIsrael knows what you\u2019re doing, Israel knows when you\u2019re doing it, and Israel knows where you\u2019re doing it.\u201d Without providing details, he accused Iran of using the facility near the city of Abadeh to \u201cconductexperiments to develop nuclear weapons\u201d. The Israeli prime minister was immediately accused of using sensitive intelligence to appear statesmanlike, just a week ahead of next Tuesday\u2019s election. Fighting a fierce reelection battle, Netanyahu has repeatedly promoted himself as the only leader capable of dealing with global security threats. His hastily-gathered press conference, televised during primetime evening slot, showed satellite photos from June of the site near the central Iranian city. He said the facility was destroyed in July, after the Iranians realised they had been discovered, but it was not clear why he waited until now to disclose the details. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s use of sensitive security information for propaganda proves that his judgment is flawed,\u201d said Benny Gantz, the head of the main opposition party, Blue and White. \u201cEven in his last days as prime minister, Netanyahu worries only about Netanyahu.\u201d Gantz\u2019s running mate, Yair Lapid, accused the prime minister of \u201cshocking national irresponsibility\u201d, adding, \u201cthe Iranian nuclear program cannot be used for campaign shenanigans\u201d. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, responded to Netanyahu on Twitter, referring to him as \u201cthe possessor of real nukes\u201d who \u201ccries wolf \u2013 on an alleged \u2018demolished\u2019 site in Iran\u201d. Zarif did not address Netanyahu\u2019s claims about Abadeh but accused the Israeli prime minister of wanting another war. In April 2018, Netanyahu made a similar announcement, claiming that Israel had discovered tens of thousands of documents from what he called Iran\u2019s \u201cAtomic Archives\u201d, which he presented as new evidence. However, key documents had been made public years earlier in 2011 by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That presentation was seen as also having a public relations element. But that time it appeared directed at Donald Trump, pressuring the US president to pull out of the 2015 nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, which he did less than two weeks later. Netanyahu had lobbied hard against the Obama-era agreement that lifted some sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, labelling it from the outset as \u201ca bad mistake of historic proportions\u201d. The IAEA and US intelligence services have said for years that Iran halted organised efforts at exploring nuclear weapons in 2003. Netanyahu did not make clear whether the alleged nuclear weapons work at the facility was before this date, nor he did make clear what kind of nuclear weapons work the Iranians are alleged to have conducted there Reuters news agency reported on Sunday that the nuclear watchdog had found traces of uranium at a separate facility that Netanyahu revealed in another announcement a year ago, calling it a \u201csecret atomic warehouse\u201d. It was not clear if the traces were remnants of material that predate the landmark 2015 deal. Monday\u2019s announcement also comes as world powers have expressed interest in a renewed dialogue with Iran, something Netanyahu sees as counterproductive. Trump has even suggested he could meet with Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani. Iran and three European countries \u2013 Britain, France and Germany \u2013 have been engaged in talks to save the landmark 2015 accord. The three countries insist that it remains the best way to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region. Iran has taken steps away from the deal since Trump pulled out. On Wednesday, Rouhani, said the country would expand its work on new centrifuges for enriching uranium. During a visit to London, Netanyahu said: \u201cThis is not the time to hold talks with Iran. This is the time to increase the pressure on Iran.\u201d Responding to the suggestion that his brief visit to the UK was designed to boost his electoral appeal, Netanyahu said: \u201cThose delusional claims are a lie. I don\u2019t profiteer with our security.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With his announcement that he will stand down as Speaker by 31 October, John Bercow is ending a House of Commons career that has seen him move from the right of the Conservative party to become a darling of Labour MPs. Standing at 170cm (5ft 6in), Bercow has become a favourite of satirists, developing a cult following abroad for his thunderous voice and the theatrical way he shouts \u201corder\u201d. He has variously been described as a \u201cstupid, sanctimonious dwarf\u201d (Conservative MP Simon Burns) to \u201cone of the great Speakers\u201d (Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party). Bercow was born in 1963 in Edgware to Jewish parents. His father was a taxi driver and he attended Finchley Manorhill comprehensive school in North Finchley before going to Essex University to study government. At university he was a member of the far-right Conservative pressure group the Monday Club and secretary of its immigration and repatriation committee. He had left the group by the age of 20 and has since described his views at the time as \u201cboneheaded\u201d. (He later led calls for Tory MPs to be banned from being members of the group.) Bercow graduated with first-class honours and worked in banking before entering politics \u2013 first as a councillor in Lambeth and then as a special adviser to chief secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Aitken. After standing for parliament twice unsuccessfully, Bercow was finally elected a Conservative MP for Buckingham in 1997. He joined the Tory frontbench two years later as a spokesman for education and employment under Theresa May and later a spokesman for home affairs under Ann Widdecombe. He arrived in the shadow cabinet in 2001 when Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith made him shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Around the early 2000s, Bercow\u2019s politics began to become more socially liberal. In 2002 he married his wife Sally Illman, a Labour supporter, who stood to be a Labour councillor in Westminster in 2010. The same year as his marriage, Bercow resigned from the front bench after rebelling to vote for Labour plans to allow unmarried gay and heterosexual couples to adopt children. He told his constituency association in his new year\u2019s message that year that voters saw the Tories as \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic and anti-youth\u201d. Bercow was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons in 2009 and quickly provoked accusations of anti-Tory bias. In 2011, the Tory MP Rob Wilson calculated that Conservatives had been slapped down by Bercow 257 times, compared with 107 for Labour since the 2010 election. Prior to the 2015 general election, Bercow was applauded by Labour MPs in the House of Commons after he survived an attempt by his own party to oust him. A motion for there to be a secret ballot to reselect a Speaker when parliament returned, tabled by then leader of the House of Commons, William Hague, was defeated by 228 to 202. Despite Bercow\u2019s historic Euroscepticism \u2013 he has been a supporter of the Bruges Group \u2013 allegations of bias quickly turned to accusations of wilful obstruction following the Brexit vote. In 2017 the Sunday Telegraph reported that he had admitted to students that in the EU referendum he had voted to remain, although Bercow insisted he would be \u201cscrupulous in ensuring that both sides of the argument are always heard\u201d. The Speaker was accused of being \u201chugely political and out of line\u201d when he said Donald Trump was unfit to address MPs in Westminster because the House of Commons was opposed to \u201cracism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary\u201d. Bercow\u2019s decisions have been key obstacles to Conservative government attempts to push through Brexit. In March this year Bercow pre-empted an attempt by Theresa May to bring a third vote on her withdrawal deal to parliament, citing a convention which dates back to 1604 that says a vote on a motion that is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as a rejected motion should not be permitted. Last month he described Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. Suggestions by friends that Bercow would resign this summer \u2013 after he had served 10 years in office \u2013 first came in the wake of a damning report by Dame Laura Cox, which said bullying and harassment in parliament were being ignored due to a tradition of \u201cdeference and silence\u201d. The report followed a Newsnight investigation that claimed Bercow bullied his former private secretaries, Angus Sinclair and Kate Emms, something he denied. Bercow made no public confirmation that he planned to leave and then changed his mind after the UK failed to leave the EU in March.

As the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, told the central bank symposium at Jackson Hole in the United States last month \u201cmonetary policy can\u2019t drive long-term growth, but the other policy levers can\u201d and \u201crelying on monetary policy risks further increases in asset prices in a slowing economy, which is an uncomfortable combination\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If all we see as a result of interest rate cuts is greater competition for established homes then all we will see is increased house prices. That might in time lead to more economic activity as people borrow against their increased home value but it\u2019s not really what the RBA is after. As we saw last week with the June GDP figures, residential building construction is dragging down economic growth across all states and territories except the ACT and Tasmania: And the latest building approval figures suggest no real improvement is on the way: New South Wales and Victoria especially continue to see a decline in the number of private sector building approvals. And it is here that we see some evidence that we should be worrying that the interest rate cuts are just fuelling house prices and not economic activity. In July, while the number of home loans for new and established dwellings took off, the numbers for construction fell \u2013 as they have for 21 out of the past 23 months: Clearly, it takes longer to decide on the construction of a house than buying one already established, and so we should not be surprised that there is such a lag, but generally there is a nice correlation between the growth of loans for construction of new homes and those for the purchase of established houses. So while we perhaps should wait a bit before getting too worried, you can understand why the governor of the Reserve Bank might be hoping the government would lend a hand with infrastructure spending. Low interest rates might get people borrowing to build a new home, but the big risk is that with rates at already record lows, further cuts will mostly affect house prices and not economic activity. At some point the government needs to realise the RBA cannot do it all. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

In a paper commissioned by Suicide Prevention Australia for World Suicide Prevention Day, the paper warns if Australia\u2019s worsening suicide rate continues, by 2030 that will mean 1,300 more suicides. The suicide rate hit an historic low in 2006 in Australia, at 10.2 per 100,000 people, down from 15.4 in 1971. But since then the trend has gone backwards, up to 12.5 in 100,000 in 2017, or 3,128 people. The paper warns that in the next decade, without better prevention and intervention, this rate could grow up to 40% or 4,430 deaths by suicide in 2030 (or 14.8 per 100,000). On the current trajectory, the suicide figure would be 3,801 in 2030 (12.7 per 100,000) while an improved scenario would put Australia at 3,113 deaths in 2030, and a rate of 10.4 per 100,000 deaths. The paper also predicts that the federal government\u2019s $15m investment in mental health data collection will reveal the official suicide rate is higher than what is currently recorded. There were a number of emerging risk factors that can affect the suicide rate, the paper found, including finance woes such as people getting into debt and the rise of buy-now-pay-later services that may not adequately check people\u2019s capacity to pay. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The growing gig economy leading to fewer people in full-time employment was another growing risk factor, the paper stated, due to potential loneliness associated with working alone. Similarly, the number of people living alone is also on the rise, but the paper noted that there was less information over whether household structures would affect relationships and social networks. The KPMG director and national mental health lead, Andrew Dempster, said in a statement that people should have a broader view of potential risk factors for suicide in Australia. \u201cThis means looking beyond the standard markers that would suggest someone is at risk.

What\u2019s the proposal? The drug-testing trial would take place in Logan (Queensland), Canterbury-Bankstown (New South Wales) and Mandurah (Western Australia). New welfare recipients would be selected for testing at random. Those who fail a test would have 80% of their welfare benefits quarantined for two years using the controversial cashless debit card.

Internal documents suggest the trial will cost $5.6m and the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) says the testing is likely to cost between $500-$900 per person per test. Has it been tried before? In New Zealand, about 40,000 welfare recipients undergo drug tests each year.

But the rebel alliance of opposition parties and Tory refugees is confident there is no trapdoor he can slip through without parliamentary consent.</p> <p>That alliance has been remarkably solid \u2013 Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru, more used to battling over every seat \u2013 combining with the exiled Tories. Good grief, even with Philip Hammond, the demon austerity chancellor only weeks ago! Their unity of purpose and voting discipline was forged throughout the summer when they met, phoned and WhatsApped. Opposing a general election was a difficult hurdle for Corbyn: he, like all opposition leaders, called for one every day. (It\u2019s said the absence of his strategy chief, Seumas Milne, on a prolonged holiday greatly eased the process of persuading the Labour leader: Milne and his coterie \u201cbristle\u201d at cooperation with other parties.) But the need to prevent Johnson calling an election across the Halloween tripwire date was paramount. The good sense of Keir Starmer, working with John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, has nudged Corbyn a long way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Parties must swallow their squeamishness and vote the Labour leader in if that\u2019s ever required</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But ahead lie many equally challenging tests of alliance unity. When parliament reconvenes in October it will have 12 days to close all loopholes and prevent a no-deal exit. Johnson may resign, or as a last resort Labour may need to depose him with a no-confidence vote. If so, the leader of the opposition would be called first to form an interim government; but will the alliance stomach him?

      "bodyText": "Who\u2019s afraid of Jeremy Corbyn? Unthinking, knee-jerk Corbynphobia is a danger in the precarious weeks ahead, as the country\u2019s fate hangs by that red thread. As parliament is brutishly banished by Boris Johnson after failing to secure an election, both sides retire to plot feverish ploys and counterploys for the Brexit endgame. Johnson\u2019s crew brief that they have scores of cunning loopholes to escape the paralysing parliamentary vice that stops him crashing the country out of the EU with no deal on 31 October, even defying the law. But the rebel alliance of opposition parties and Tory refugees is confident there is no trapdoor he can slip through without parliamentary consent. That alliance has been remarkably solid \u2013 Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru, more used to battling over every seat \u2013 combining with the exiled Tories. Good grief, even with Philip Hammond, the demon austerity chancellor only weeks ago! Their unity of purpose and voting discipline was forged throughout the summer when they met, phoned and WhatsApped. Opposing a general election was a difficult hurdle for Corbyn: he, like all opposition leaders, called for one every day. (It\u2019s said the absence of his strategy chief, Seumas Milne, on a prolonged holiday greatly eased the process of persuading the Labour leader: Milne and his coterie \u201cbristle\u201d at cooperation with other parties.) But the need to prevent Johnson calling an election across the Halloween tripwire date was paramount. The good sense of Keir Starmer, working with John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, has nudged Corbyn a long way. But ahead lie many equally challenging tests of alliance unity. When parliament reconvenes in October it will have 12 days to close all loopholes and prevent a no-deal exit. Johnson may resign, or as a last resort Labour may need to depose him with a no-confidence vote. If so, the leader of the opposition would be called first to form an interim government; but will the alliance stomach him? When first mooted, the answer was no, but many are showing a new willingness to accept the inevitable. Take Kenneth Clarke, the expelled former Tory chancellor. Asked which is worse, Corbyn or no-deal Brexit, he tells the Observer: \u201cBoth are awful prospects, but I think a no-deal Brexit could cause far more damage to our future economic success than Corbyn.\u201d More astonishing is last week\u2019s report \u201cCity warms to Corbyn\u201d in the Telegraph (yes, the Telegraph!).

His policies may be \u201cmarket-unfriendly\u201d but still preferable to the \u201cpermanent shock\u201d of no-deal Brexit. \u201cFears\u201d of Labour \u201cmay be overstated\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to get a deal with the European Union seems like a speeding car negotiating with a brick wall. The more solid and immovable the wall appears, the harder Mr Johnson charges towards it, claiming he is unable to swerve out of the way. The British prime minister reasons that as both the vehicle and the barrier have a part to play in a car crash, he can blame the collision on the wall because it is made of brick. Hence his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49608822\" title=\"\">laughable claim</a> that Dublin will be as responsible for a damaging no-deal Brexit, should it befall these islands, as Britain is. This is nonsense. It was the Conservative government of Theresa May that negotiated the withdrawal agreement with the European Union. Mr Johnson even voted for Mrs May\u2019s Brexit deal in March because he<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/102877/boris-johnson-reaches-sad-conclusion-he\" title=\"\"> thought it could be refined in future negotiations</a>. Mr Johnson\u2019s earlier insight \u2013 that there are years of negotiations to come in which things can be settled to mutual advantage \u2013 seems to have deserted him as prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to get a deal with the European Union seems like a speeding car negotiating with a brick wall. The more solid and immovable the wall appears, the harder Mr Johnson charges towards it, claiming he is unable to swerve out of the way. The British prime minister reasons that as both the vehicle and the barrier have a part to play in a car crash, he can blame the collision on the wall because it is made of brick. Hence his laughable claim that Dublin will be as responsible for a damaging no-deal Brexit, should it befall these islands, as Britain is. This is nonsense. It was the Conservative government of Theresa May that negotiated the withdrawal agreement with the European Union. Mr Johnson even voted for Mrs May\u2019s Brexit deal in March because he thought it could be refined in future negotiations. Mr Johnson\u2019s earlier insight \u2013 that there are years of negotiations to come in which things can be settled to mutual advantage \u2013 seems to have deserted him as prime minister. Mrs May\u2019s failure can be attributed to her flaws, but also to the Conservative party and its hardliners who refused to soften in any way the hard Brexit they favour. Mr Johnson\u2019s strategy is to weaponise this obduracy simultaneously in international and domestic arenas. This has been a monumental failure.

Lloyds expects to take another PPI charge of between \u00a31.2bn and \u00a31.8bn in the third quarter, while Barclays expects to put aside between \u00a31.2bn and \u00a31.6bn.</p> \n<p>Those estimates are sharply higher than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/sep/04/rbs-warns-of-further-900m-hit-from-deluge-of-late-ppi-claims\">\u00a3900m charge announced by Royal Bank of Scotland</a> last week, after the bank said it was also hit by a last-minute rush in claims.

Once confirmed, it will bring Lloyds\u2019 total PPI bill to almost \u00a322bn \u2013 by far the largest of all the banks and larger than the near \u00a315bn in combined annual profits reported by the bank since it first started taking claims in 2011.</p> \n<p>The sum is almost double the second-largest bill, footed by Barclays, which could reach \u00a311.2bn in the third quarter. Barclays warned that its final PPI bill \u201cwill depend on a number of factors, including the quality of recently submitted claims\u201d.</p> \n<p>Smaller lenders including the<strong> </strong>Co-operative Bank have also dealt with a late rush in PPI complaints. The lender, which put aside an extra \u00a32.5m in recent months, said last week it received a \u201csubstantially greater volume\u201d of claims but stopped short of estimating the resulting costs.</p> \n<p>PPI provisions are meant to cover compensation and administrative costs.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays have warned they will take billions of pounds in extra charges to cover a last-minute surge in claims relating to mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). The lenders said they underestimated the number of complaints they would receive in the run-up to the 29 August deadline and will increase provisions following a spike in claims before the cut-off. Lloyds expects to take another PPI charge of between \u00a31.2bn and \u00a31.8bn in the third quarter, while Barclays expects to put aside between \u00a31.2bn and \u00a31.6bn. Those estimates are sharply higher than the \u00a3900m charge announced by Royal Bank of Scotland last week, after the bank said it was also hit by a last-minute rush in claims. CYBG, which owns the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks and Virgin Money, warned that it faced a potential bill of \u00a3450m for new complaints. In total, six of the largest high street banks have announced provisions worth almost \u00a349bn, in order to compensate customers who purchased often worthless cover in what has become the UK\u2019s largest mis-selling scandals. Lloyds\u2019 latest provision adds to the \u00a3550m in PPI charges taken in the second quarter, which pushed down the bank\u2019s pre-tax profits by 7% to \u00a32.9bn for the six months to the end of June. Once confirmed, it will bring Lloyds\u2019 total PPI bill to almost \u00a322bn \u2013 by far the largest of all the banks and larger than the near \u00a315bn in combined annual profits reported by the bank since it first started taking claims in 2011. The sum is almost double the second-largest bill, footed by Barclays, which could reach \u00a311.2bn in the third quarter. Barclays warned that its final PPI bill \u201cwill depend on a number of factors, including the quality of recently submitted claims\u201d. Smaller lenders including the Co-operative Bank have also dealt with a late rush in PPI complaints. The lender, which put aside an extra \u00a32.5m in recent months, said last week it received a \u201csubstantially greater volume\u201d of claims but stopped short of estimating the resulting costs. PPI provisions are meant to cover compensation and administrative costs. While most lenders have refused to disclose how many workers are processing claims, the Guardian understands that Lloyds has about 6,000 staff \u2013 most of whom are contractors \u2013 processing PPI claims on its behalf. Lloyds announced on Monday that it was suspending the remainder of its 2019 share buyback programme, given uncertainty around the final costs of the PPI scandal, leaving \u00a3600m of the \u00a31.75bn programme unused. The buyback, launched in March, had been a sign of Lloyds\u2019 confidence in the business, despite Brexit. Share buybacks are often an alternative to paying dividends to shareholders and can help consolidate ownership and boost stock value by cutting down the number of shares in circulation. Lloyds said it was still committed to increasing its ordinary dividend. However, the lender expects capital growth and its return on equity to be below its previous guidance, saying the final outcome will depend on the final PPI bill. Since it started taking claims in 2011, Lloyds has typically received 70,000 PPI information requests a week but this soared to 600,000 to 800,000 a week in the final weeks before the 29 August deadline. Russ Mould, an investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cThe extra costs do knock the investment case for Lloyds as they hit return on equity, hamper the bank\u2019s plans to build up its capital buffers and therefore its ability to distribute spare cash once regulators are satisfied that it has sufficient financial ammunition to withstand any future crisis. \u201cThe good news is that this should at least see Lloyds through PPI and that no further hits can come from it.\u201d About 64m PPI policies were sold in the UK, mostly between 1990 and 2010. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the insurance alongside loans, credit cards and other deals \u2013 but in many cases, exclusions meant customers could never make a claim.",

Since the category 5 hurricane tore into north-western islands of the Bahamas eight days ago, with winds gusting above 200mph and a storm surge of more than 20ft, thousands have been evacuated to Nassau or the US.

      "body": "<p>Rafa Nadal has never taken his talent for granted. Of the three players who have defined his era, he is the most humble. So, as he stands on the verge of surpassing Roger Federer\u2019s 20 majors and drawing away from the 16 owned by Novak Djokovic, he knows that beating one of the hunting pack, Daniil Medvedev, to win his fourth US Open was significant in more ways than one.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/09/rafael-nadal-cherishes-moment-at-us-open-as-clock-ticks-on-golden-career\" title=\"\">Sunday\u2019s teeth-grinding five\u2011setter</a>, which he could have ended way before its eventual four hours and 50 minutes duration, proved to everyone \u2013 including the winner \u2013 that, at 33, he has the will to continue.</p> <p>For others of that age or thereabouts the questions are different: none dreams of bettering Federer or Djokovic; all of them are happy to be still standing, including Andy Murray, whose comeback from hip surgery continues steadily away from the main stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/09/rafael-nadal-cherishes-moment-at-us-open-as-clock-ticks-on-golden-career\">Rafael Nadal cherishes moment at US Open as clock ticks on golden career | Tumaini Carayol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Nadal it has always been like this. Since he won the first of his 19 majors \u2013 at Roland Garros, where he would win another 11 and where he surely will be favourite for as long as he wants \u2013 he has lived in Federer\u2019s shadow. So has Djokovic.</p> <p>Often Federer\u2019s grace under pressure, his sheer artistry in a physical sport and his winning demeanour has made him unbeatable in the eyes of millions. Even when he loses they love him still. There are books written about the love affair. No such tome exists for Nadal or Djokovic. They are praised prosaically, for the technical mastery they have over a difficult sport.</p> <p>Yet those who have watched Nadal closely will have seen how the hard work he does away from the court manifests itself in subtle ways in the heat of battle \u2013 and there was a lot of heat on Sunday night when, after butchering a smash in the third set when he was close to a straightforward victory, he found ways to win.</p> <p>In front of him was a young opponent in his first slam final who displays aspects of Djokovic\u2019s stretching defence and Federer\u2019s outrageous cleverness. Nadal prevailed because he had seen it all before, however demanding the struggle became. Only bona fide champions can win when it looks likely they will lose.</p> <p>After a 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 win that kept 24,000 fans swaying between the Spaniard and the Russian in their affections Nadal said: \u201cThe last three hours of the match were very, very intense, no? Very tough mentally and physically, too. The crowd were amazing, all these facts that make the moment super special, no?

      "bodyText": "Rafa Nadal has never taken his talent for granted. Of the three players who have defined his era, he is the most humble. So, as he stands on the verge of surpassing Roger Federer\u2019s 20 majors and drawing away from the 16 owned by Novak Djokovic, he knows that beating one of the hunting pack, Daniil Medvedev, to win his fourth US Open was significant in more ways than one. Sunday\u2019s teeth-grinding five\u2011setter, which he could have ended way before its eventual four hours and 50 minutes duration, proved to everyone \u2013 including the winner \u2013 that, at 33, he has the will to continue. For others of that age or thereabouts the questions are different: none dreams of bettering Federer or Djokovic; all of them are happy to be still standing, including Andy Murray, whose comeback from hip surgery continues steadily away from the main stage. For Nadal it has always been like this. Since he won the first of his 19 majors \u2013 at Roland Garros, where he would win another 11 and where he surely will be favourite for as long as he wants \u2013 he has lived in Federer\u2019s shadow. So has Djokovic. Often Federer\u2019s grace under pressure, his sheer artistry in a physical sport and his winning demeanour has made him unbeatable in the eyes of millions. Even when he loses they love him still. There are books written about the love affair. No such tome exists for Nadal or Djokovic. They are praised prosaically, for the technical mastery they have over a difficult sport. Yet those who have watched Nadal closely will have seen how the hard work he does away from the court manifests itself in subtle ways in the heat of battle \u2013 and there was a lot of heat on Sunday night when, after butchering a smash in the third set when he was close to a straightforward victory, he found ways to win. In front of him was a young opponent in his first slam final who displays aspects of Djokovic\u2019s stretching defence and Federer\u2019s outrageous cleverness. Nadal prevailed because he had seen it all before, however demanding the struggle became. Only bona fide champions can win when it looks likely they will lose. After a 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 win that kept 24,000 fans swaying between the Spaniard and the Russian in their affections Nadal said: \u201cThe last three hours of the match were very, very intense, no? Very tough mentally and physically, too. The crowd were amazing, all these facts that make the moment super special, no? Unforgettable moment.\u201d For once reference to the crowd was not fatuous. They more than likely did play a part. The New York fans are the loudest, most passionate and certainly most fickle in tennis. At the start they were with Nadal. All fortnight Medvedev had wound them up, behaving like a brat at the beginning, then inviting their derision to give him strength and, finally, winning their admiration for the beauty of his game and his fighting heart in one of the truly great finals. He was gobsmacked in a totally Russian way, repeating over and again what it meant to him to be part of history. \u201cI\u2019m sure even talking about Rafa\u2019s 19 grand slams, I\u2019m sure he remembers his first final, even though he won it and I lost it. It was an amazing match. It\u2019s an amazing story. All this summer is amazing for me. I will remember every moment of it.\u201d And there he nailed it. His summer roll is what carried him to the final. Medvedev had won all over the place leading up to the tournament, 12 matches in a row. Crucially, his most recent defeat had been to Nadal, a 6-3, 6-0 spanking in Montreal. But he is young enough for such a score not to unsettle his confidence or self-belief. Like Bianca Andreescu, the 19-year-old Canadian who, the night before, slew a legend in Serena Williams, Medvedev has the courage of youth. He is not scarred by serial failure.

The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive.</p>\n    <p>Passengers are also entitled to \u2018assistance\u2019 under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline\u2019s fault.</p>\n    <p>The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events or a last-minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control.

Community pharmacies offer rapid access to healthcare advice and lifestyle support, with health checks identifying high-risk patients earlier and helping them stay out of hospital. With the NHS facing a staffing crisis and with growing demand, supporting earlier detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the community has the potential to save lives, improve patient care and reduce pressure on GPs and other parts of the health service.

Even in Wren\u2019s lifetime what came to be called Baroque was criticised by neo-Palladians as \u201ccapricious\u201d, \u201cchimerical\u201d and \u201cretaining much of what artists call the Gothic kind\u201d. Having already outlined the extent to which Wren acted as Hawksmoor\u2019s teacher, Kerry now saw to it that the cult that grew around the pupil would not diminish the credit due to the creator of the world\u2019s first new Protestant cathedral, St Paul\u2019s.</p> <p>If the precise ways in which Wren and Hawksmoor were indebted to Borromini were never completely clarified by Kerry \u2013 who in any case tended to resist conventionally causal accounts of direct influence \u2013 he highlighted their common origins in Greek and Roman architecture. </p> <p>In his second, more succinct, book on Hawksmoor (1969) he confirmed that the pupil diverged from Wren in according a more positive role for the imagination, or \u201cFancy\u201d. He also claimed this was probably due to Thomas Hobbes\u2019s discussion of \u201cthe effect of works of art on the emotions without the intermediacy of intellect\u201d. Illustrative of this was the neo-Gothic brilliance of All Souls College, Oxford, of whose hall he observed: \u201cNo other roof in England shows such free plasticity, which is closer to certain rooms by Borromini or the church vaults of Central European Baroque\u201d.</p> <p>Vanbrugh (1977) demonstrated how the architect, largely self-taught, as Inigo Jones and Wren had been, benefited from Hawksmoor\u2019s accumulated professional expertise. Their partnership was perhaps even more creative and competitive than Hawksmoor\u2019s with Wren. They built Castle Howard, near York (the setting of Brideshead Revisited for both TV and film), surrounded by pyramids, obelisks, a classical temple and the extraordinary mausoleum for Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle; and Britain\u2019s most magnificent Baroque sculpture-cum-country house, Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, the nation\u2019s gift to the victorious 1st Duke of Marlborough.</p> <p>After succeeding Wren as surveyor of the Royal Naval hospital at Greenwich, Vanbrugh ended up building himself Vanbrugh Castle, a Gothic fortress overlooking it. Hawksmoor meanwhile, inherited Wren\u2019s surveyorship of Westminster Abbey and built those landmark towers that many assume to be medieval.</p> <p>Sir John Vanbrugh: A Biography (1987) included Vanbrugh\u2019s career as a playwright, before, in the words of Swift: \u201cVan\u2019s genius, without thought or lecture ... hugely turned to architecture.\u201d Kerry noted the visit to Italy in the 1650s by Vanbrugh\u2019s father, reminding the reader that none of his architects went. He did, however, discuss Vanbrugh\u2019s sketch of a cemetery featuring domed mausoleums built by the East India Company in Surat, Gujarat, taking it that the image must have come from family contacts with eastern trade. He was characteristically generous in acknowledging Robert Williams\u2019 later discovery that as a young man Vanbrugh had worked in India for a year and a half.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2880d07705111b7fdc1e9b4ded6ebfe4eeaec874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2880d07705111b7fdc1e9b4ded6ebfe4eeaec874/115_157_5909_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Castle Howard, Yorkshire, was built by John Vanbrugh in partnership with Nicholas Hawksmoor.

      "bodyText": "What do political leaders hope to achieve by breaking with constitutional rules and conventions? As government policy becomes increasingly hard line, from talk of proroguing parliament to ignoring its laws at the risk of jail, much of the coverage has focused on the goals this may serve. Whether as part of a negotiating strategy intended to force the hand of EU partners by showing how close a no-deal Brexit could be, or as a way to weaken domestic opposition and run down the clock, constitutional transgression can be read as a way to get things done. But breaking with norms can also be an end in itself. Rather than being about achieving specifics, it can be a way of signalling broader ideas \u2013 about the nature and authority of executive power, and about politics itself. In the name of getting a task done, leaders can seek a wider redefinition of themselves and the landscape around them. Sometimes ostentatious norm-breaking is done by politicians who regard themselves as moderates and want to polish their credentials as technocrats. Breaking with procedural norms can be a way of aligning with the demands of technical experts and showing willingness to adhere to their recommendations. Governments instituting austerity measures have been a familiar example in contemporary Europe \u2013 in the early 2010s, governments in Greece, Italy and elsewhere passed new budget laws by decree, marginalising their legislatures in part or in whole.

At face value the Dutch city of Arnhem is to golf what steak dinners are to vegetarians. This 23-year-old has broken the mould.</p> <p>\u201cAmong my friends golf was not really a sport; they\u2019d ask why I needed to practise so much,\u201d Van Dam says. \u201cNow they all love it because they see what it brings me. For kids of a certain age [in the Netherlands] it isn\u2019t an option or a sport they think about. That was difficult for me because I couldn\u2019t really share my pleasure and experiences with people my age. But the more time I put into it, the better I got; winning tournaments and travelling internationally made me think about where my potential could take me. But at the start it was hard; golf is not a big sport in Holland and the season isn\u2019t great there either.

At an average of 284 yards, she topped the driving distance charts there for good measure. Van Dam turned professional immediately on leaving high school and has not looked back.

It\u2019s nice to inspire people, which is what I am trying to do; especially girls in Holland, Belgium, Germany who might think about what could happen with golf.\u201d</p> <p>Van Dam is wonderfully forthright, as illustrated at this year\u2019s Scottish Open, when she publicly took aim at an easy course setup.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has attempted to dismiss suggestions of impropriety over Vice-President Mike Pence\u2019s stay at his Doonbeg resort in Ireland and US military use of an airport near his Turnberry golf course in Scotland. Amid a slew of Monday morning tweets attacking enemies and heralding his own achievements, the president said he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with Pence\u2019s stay and \u201cknew nothing\u201d about official use of the airport near his course. The House oversight committee has been investigating whether increasing expenditure at the airport and allegations of US military personnel being offered discount deals at Trump\u2019s Ayrshire golf resort represent a violation of the US constitution. The emoluments clause of the US constitution bars the use of elected office for private gain, and ethics experts have said Trump\u2019s alleged abuse of the clause could in itself constitute impeachable behavior. On taking office, the president did not fully divest from the Trump Organization, which is now run by two of his sons. Trump\u2019s own stays at his own properties, most notably Mar-a-Lago in Florida, as well as government and diplomatic use of his hotel in Washington, have raised concerns that he is profiting from his presidency. At the G7 summit in Biarritz, France last month, Trump raised eyebrows at home and abroad by strongly suggesting the 2020 summit should be held at his golf resort in Doral, Florida. Pence visited Ireland last week, while Trump stayed at home to monitor Hurricane Dorian and play golf at his course in Virginia. The vice-president stayed at the Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg, on the west coast. That posed logistical challenges, as the resort is 180 miles away from Dublin, where Pence met the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. On Monday morning, Trump wrote that he \u201chad nothing to do with the decision of our great [VP] Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump-owned resorts in Doonbeg, Ireland\u201d. However, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, the former White House aide Marc Short, said last week Trump had made a \u201csuggestion\u201d that his vice-president should stay there. Short also said security concerns and Pence\u2019s desire to visit the home of an ancestor contributed to the decision. Trump added: \u201cMike\u2019s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years, and he thought that during his very busy European visit, he would stop and see his family!\u201d Democrats are also concerned about US military stopovers at Glasgow\u2019s Prestwick airport, which is near the Trump-owned golf course at Turnberry and which has benefited from purchases of fuel by the US defense department. According to media reports, the Turnberry resort has offered visiting air crews free rounds of golf. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House oversight committee, wrote in June to the then acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, to raise \u201cserious conflict of interest concerns\u201d about Trump making money from US military trips to Scotland. According to Politico, which broke news of the House investigation, the letter said US military spending at Prestwick, the closest airport to Trump\u2019s resort, appeared to have \u201cincreased substantially since the election\u201d. It was reported that the Pentagon had not cooperated with the House investigation. On Sunday night, the US air force ordered a review of all international layover stays.

      "bodyText": "The cast of Terrence Malick\u2019s life of Christ film has been revealed, with Son of Saul star G\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig taking the leading role. R\u00f6hrig will play Jesus in The Last Planet, which will tell the story of Christ\u2019s life through a series of parables. Matthias Schoenaerts, who features in Malick\u2019s most recent film, A Hidden Life, will portray St Peter, while Mark Rylance is Satan. Speaking at the Deauville film festival, Rylance said production on his scenes would begin in October, and that he would be playing multiple versions of Beelzebub. \u201cTerry wrote four versions of the character of Satan,\u201d he said, \u201cand I thought I would play only one. But I heard I was going to play all four. One of them must have been a woman at some point, but it was when he asked me to grow a beard that I realised I wasn\u2019t going to do it that way. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to act for Terrence Malick, but I\u2019m intrigued, because I hear he talks to you all the time. And coming from the theatre, I\u2019m not used to the director yelling at me while I act or tell me what to do. But his films always intrigued me.\u201d Malick\u2019s faith has been an explicit element of his work from his first films, with its centrality increasing in more recent movies. R\u00f6hrig, who shot to fame in his first role as a prisoner in Auschwitz in L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\u2019s Oscar winner, until recently worked as a Bible teacher and corpse-washer in the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York.",

      "bodyText": "After a weekend of bruising winds and torrential rain unleashed by Hurricane Dorian, emergency crews on Canada\u2019s east cost have begun the task of restoring electricity to the region after more than 500,000 residents were left without power. Dorian was downgraded to a post-tropical storm as it made landfall near Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Saturday evening, but wind speeds still reached 150km/h (93mph), similar in intensity to a category 2 hurricane. Trees, power lines and even a crane in downtown Halifax were knocked down by the powerful gusts, leaving half a million people without power and in many cases, without cellphone service. More than 100mm (4in) of rain also fell in less than 24 hours. While the intensity of the storm was nothing like the category 5 hurricane that devastated the Bahamas last week, the widespread damage nonetheless left emergency crews scrambling throughout the collection of Maritime provinces. \u201cThis is an exercise of days, not hours,\u201d Karen Hutt, CEO of Nova Scotia Power, told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re operating in our worst-case scenario.\u201d Power technicians from Ontario, Quebec, Maine \u2013 and as far away as Florida \u2013 were dispatched to assist local crews restore power. The Canadian military also deployed forces to help clear roads. By Monday, as power was restored in some areas, residents were left to assess damage. Many of the streets in Halifax, the largest city on the east coast, had large trees uprooted, tearing up sidewalks and roads and pulling down power lines. At least 200,000 remained without electricity in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador. Long lines outside fast-food restaurants \u2013 including the coffee chain Tim Hortons \u2013 blocked emergency vehicle routes, prompting city officials to request residents stay at home. \u201cPeople need to stay off the roads today. Let us get out there and do our jobs,\u201d Erica Fleck, an assistant chief with Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency, told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe can\u2019t clear [the roads] until we can actually get to the roads, and 300 cars at a drive-thru right now is really stopping our progress.\u201d The Nova Scotia premier, Stephen McNeil, also chastised residents for blocking traffic. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for you to come down and get your coffee. You don\u2019t have to do that today. It\u2019s important to allow the level of professionals we have in this province go out and do their work,\u201d he said at a weekend press conference. Public schools were closed throughout the region on Monday as crews worked to saw through trees and repair downed electrical lines, hopeful that power would be fully restored later this week.",

      "bodyText": "Finally, the pound\u2019s rally has seen the FTSE 100 close 46 points lower at 7,235, down 0.65%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Brexit optimism played a part, alongside the growth figures: The FTSE languished in the red at the start of the trading week, beaten down by the strengthening pound and a slump at Primark owner AB Foods. As sterling rose to six-week highs on renewed Brexit optimism and stronger data, the multinationals on the FTSE sunk lower owing to the unfavourable exchange rate. There was no getting way from Brexit as the new week kicked off, hardly surprising given the flow of headlines across the weekend. However, today it was Boris Johnson\u2019s softer approach to Brexit that grabbed traders\u2019 attention. Bojo sounding keen to get a deal done when he was speaking with the Irish Prime Minister helped boost demand for the pound, as did signs that the UK economy was holding up even as Westminster was crumbling. In a surprise reversal of roles, CNN is accusing Donald Trump of Fake News! Time for a recap. Fears that Britain is sliding into recession have eased, after the economy posted its strongest monthly growth since January. UK GDP rose by 0.3% in July, the ONS reported, beating City forecasts of just 0.1% growth. That suggests growth is picking up, after a worrying contraction in the spring. But over the last three months, the country\u2019s GDP is flat - showing that Brexit uncertainty is continuing to hold back investment. Construction and industrial output have both fallen in the last quarter, with the service sector propping the economy up. Economists are hopeful that the UK will grow in the current quarter (from July-September), with some speculation that Brexit stockpiling will help. Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, explains: \u201cMechanically the 0.3% rise in July very much improves the chance of the UK avoiding a technical recession this quarter. However, combined with the picture coming from business surveys, the data still looks consistent with weak underlying growth in the UK economy as the next Brexit deadline approaches.\u201d The pound rallied to its highest level in six weeks after the data was published. Stronger growth makes it less likely that the Bank of England would be forced to lower interest rates back to record lows. Optimism that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided is also supporting sterling, as parliament prepares to shut down for five weeks. Over on Wall Street, activist investor Elliott Management has taken a $3.2bn stake in telecoms giant AT&amp;T.....and Donald Trump has weighed in. Elliott is pushing for a strategic overhaul at the US telecoms group, saying its $80bn takeover of Time Warner has been botched. AT&amp;T\u2019s shares have jumped 9% in pre-market trading to over $38 as investors welcome the move -- Elliott claims they could be worth $60 by the end of 2021, with some improved management. It\u2019s a significant move, but not SO important that the world\u2019s most powerful man should automatically take an interest. President Trump, though, is interested... as it\u2019s another opportunity to lambast CNN. I suspect foreign leaders are more interested in geopolitical issues, such as the sudden collapse of the Afghanistan peace talks over the weekend..... Anyone needing a rest after the excitement of this morning\u2019s GDP figures should head to Heathrow Airport. Terminal Five, usually a bustling hive of travellers, is unusually quiet today after British Airways pilots launched an unprecedented strike. My colleague Gwyn Topham reports: The start of a 48-hour walkout by British Airways pilots forced the national carrier to cancel virtually all flights on Monday, with no sign of a resolution ahead of more planned strikes. Heathrow Terminal 5, BA\u2019s main operating hub, was virtually deserted, when it would normally be bustling with passengers. BA carries about 145,000 passengers on an average day. In other news, the PPI scandal continues to rumble on. Lloyds Banking Group has hit shareholders with another \u00a31.8bn provision to compensate customers who were mis-sold insurance policies alongside financial products such as credit cards and mortgages. Lloyds, like other banks, has been hit by a late surge of inquiries before last week\u2019s deadline to get PPI claims in. The pound\u2019s strength has pushed the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip London-listed shares down to a one-week low. The Footsie has lost 45 points, or 0.6%, with most sectors down - led by healthcare firms, consumer groups, industrial companies and miners. Relief that the UK may be dodging a recession has swept the pound up to a new six-week high. Sterling has hit $1.2380 against the US dollar for the first time since 26 July, a couple of days after Boris Johnson beat Jeremy Hunt to the leadership of the Conservative Party. It\u2019s also trading at a six-week high against the euro, at \u20ac1.121. Hopes that Britain can side-step a no-deal Brexit are also supporting sterling. The latest word is that parliament will be prorogued (shut down) later today, until 14th October, with a snap general election possibly taking place in late November.... Today\u2019s GDP report has sent economists racing to update their forecasts. NIESR, the think tank, now estimates that the UK will grow by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2019, returning to growth after its Q2 contraction. That\u2019s up from 0.2% previously - underlining that July\u2019s growth figures (+0.3%) beat forecasts. NIESR director Dr Garry Young says: \u201cIt looks like there has been a welcome resumption of economic growth in the third quarter, roughly offsetting the fall in the second quarter. But it is not clear how long growth will continue. Only the services sector is expanding, primarily to meet higher demand from consumers driven by increased household incomes fuelled by rising real wages. But there is a limit to how much further real wages can grow without a pick-up in investment and productivity, and this seems unlikely in the near term.\u201d Britain\u2019s Federation of Small Businesses is calling for an emergency budget to help the economy avoid a Brexit-induced recession. FSB National Chairman Mike Cherry says bosses aren\u2019t able to plan, hire or grow their companies while there is so much uncertainty about the future and \u201cposturing\u201d (ouch!) in parliament. \u201cThe very prospect of a sudden, chaotic no-deal Brexit in less than eight weeks\u2019 time is proving enough to have a sustained chilling effect on output. That\u2019s why the Government needs to intervene with an Emergency Brexit Budget that will take the heat off employers, support our high streets and push back premature tax changes. \u201cGetting our economy back on track starts with securing a pro-business Brexit deal. Three years on from the referendum, business owners are sick to the back teeth of parliamentary posturing. Cherry also suspects that today\u2019s growth figures could be flattered by Brexit stockpiling: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to note the GDP uptick in the month of July, driven by manufacturers and construction firms. It\u2019s possible that stockpiling is once again having an impact but \u2013 having already been marched up the hill only to be marched back down again earlier in the year \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t bank on a big stockpiling-linked GDP bump of the kind we saw in Q1.\u201d Although today\u2019s GDP report did beat expectations, it still shows that the UK economy has been stagnant over the last quarter -- hardly a sparkling effort. John Westwood, group managing director of Black Tower Financial Management urges caution about celebrating too much: Today\u2019s GDP update will be welcomed by many, especially Boris Johnson. Growth is up from -0.2% to 0%; better than all forecasts predicted. Brexit recession fears have eased for many analysts, however I would still tread a line of caution as this may not represent the full picture. The 0% figure still shows an economy under pressure from Brexit uncertainty. The service sector saw a positive growth, meaning that businesses maybe preparing for the worst outcome. Today\u2019s news should still be a warning to analysts and businesses that Brexit is an unknown. It\u2019s a nice change to see the pound rallying on the back of economic data, rather than plunging in the face of a political crisis. Philip Shaw of Investec tweets: Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: The chances of the UK avoiding recession have improved following a better-than-expected 0.3% increase in activity in July. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that all sectors of the economy registered growth in the month \u2013 the first of the third quarter. Fears that Britain might slip into recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product \u2013 had been stoked by the 0.2% decline in output in the three months to June. But in July the services sector \u2013 which accounts for about 80% of the economy \u2013 grew by 0.3%, while the struggling manufacturing and construction sectors also bounced back with increases in output of 0.3% and 0.5% respectively. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s story on the GDP report: PwC chief economist John Hawksworth also fears that a disorderly Brexit could plunge Britain into a recession. If a reasonably smooth exit from the EU can be achieved, then we remain optimistic that UK growth could bounce back to over 1% next year as business investment recovers and public spending picks up in line with the plans announced by the Chancellor last week. \u201cBut if there is a disorderly Brexit, the UK economy could be tipped into recession. And if there is a prolonged period of political limbo with no clear resolution of the Brexit issue, then businesses could continue to defer major investment decisions, causing the UK economy to continue to stall.\u201d Today\u2019s growth figures are a rare piece of good news for Boris Johnson (who is in Dublin today). Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University argues the prime minister can take three steps to avoid a no-deal recession in 2020. Today\u2019s GDP figure provides Prime Minister Boris Johnson with an unexpected economic lifeline as it eases fears of a looming recession. Rolling-three month (quarter-on-quarter) growth is up from -0.2% in 2019 Q2 to 0% in the period from May to July 2019. No growth at all is better than negative growth and should help focus political minds. Indeed, a Brexit-related UK recession is far from certain and should not be too late for Boris Johnson to change course. One way of doing this is for our Prime Minister to (a) reverse the Parliament\u2019s shutdown, (b) invite back to his party the 21 Conservative rebels and (c) agree with Brussels a\u2019 tweaked version\u2019 of Mrs May\u2019s withdrawal deal so that he can bring it back to Parliament with reasonable chances of approval. Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at ForexTime (FXTM), points out that pound is one of the best-performing currencies today, partly thanks to the GDP figures. Paul Dales of Capital Economics suspects a new burst of Brexit stockpiling may be helping the UK avoid recession. The 0.3% m/m rise in services GDP followed four months of no change and was partly due to a 1.1% m/m rise in transport and storage output. The latter is the first real sign that businesses could be bringing activity forward ahead of the possible 31st October Brexit deadline. Samuel Fuller, director of Financial Markets Online, says the market reaction shows that expectations for the UK economy have fallen rather low: \u201cSeldom has stagnation seemed like such an achievement. \u201cDespite sharp falls in both manufacturing and construction output, Britain\u2019s vast service sector has ridden to the rescue once more \u2013 dragging the net position up to zero. \u201cAs a result, the jury remains out on whether the UK is about to enter a recession. The prospect is perilously close but not yet inevitable. The BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam reckons the UK will avoid falling into a recession this autumn. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics points out that July was the strongest month for growth since January. But Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation points out that the picture over the last quarter is less rosy: Today\u2019s GDP report also shows how Brexit stockpiling has distorted growth this year. As you can see, UK production spiked in March as firms scrambled to buy essential components and store finished goods, ahead of the original Brexit deadline. It then slumped in April, partly because car factories brought forward their summer shutdowns in case of a no-deal crisis. The growth report has given the pound a small lift. Sterling has shaken off its earlier losses, and is now up 0.25% today at $1.231. The broad picture is that Britain\u2019s economy has weakened this year, warns Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS. He points out that factories and builders both suffered falling output in the last three months, which is why there was no growth in May-July. Kent-Smith says: \u201cGDP growth was flat in the latest three months, with falls in construction and manufacturing. \u201cWhile the largest part of the economy, services sector, returned to growth in the month of July, the underlying picture shows services growth weakening through 2019. The trade deficit narrowed due to falling imports, particularly unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), chemicals and road vehicles in the three months to July.\u201d Let\u2019s dig into the detail of the GDP report. According to the ONS, Britain\u2019s services sector grew by 0.3% in July, providing the bulk of the growth. But manufacturing also expanded by 0.3%, helping the wider industrial sector to grow by 0.1% during the month. The Office for National Statistics says UK GDP remains \u201cweak\u201d, with no growth in the last three months (despite the recovery in July). Newsflash: The UK economy grew by 0.3% in July. That\u2019s stronger than the 0.1% expected, and could dampen fears of a Brexit recession this autumn. Over the last three months (May-July), GDP was unchanged. That\u2019s a weak reading, but stronger than the -0.2% recorded in April-June. More to follow! Despite worries about the global economy, investors are pushing stock markets higher this morning. Beijing can take the credit. Over the weekend, China\u2019s central bank launched a new stimulus package of cheap loans, to protect its companies from the latest US tariffs. This lifted the Shanghai exchange by 0.8%, and pushed Japan up by almost 1%. European markets have also benefited, hitting a five-week high in early trading. The UK isn\u2019t alone in suffering weak growth. The eurozone only expanded by 0.2% in April-June, Germany may be falling into recession, and the US-China trade war is causing turbulence worldwide. This chart from economist Rupert Seggins shows how the UK has fallen towards the bottom of the global growth league over the last year, but certainly isn\u2019t the worst economy out there: This chart from Bloomberg shows how UK growth has been choppy recently, vanishing altogether in the second quarter of 2019. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Sanjay Raja hopes that the service sector will keep Britain out of recession this summer, telling clients: Outside of another momentous week in politics, next week\u2019s data docket will be very important for the economy. On Monday, we will get a first glimpse of Q3 activity with the July monthly GDP reading out in the morning. If survey indicators are anything to go on, we should continue to see widespread weakness across the economy, with manufacturing, construction and services sectors all dropping. However, we don\u2019t expect the economy to shrink in July. Instead, we see a modest bump in activity (0.1% m-o-m), driven in large part by the services sector. With retail spending and government consumption up in July, we think this will be enough to prop up the economy. Here\u2019s some grim news - Northern Ireland\u2019s private sector economy may have already plunged into recession. A new survey of companies across Northern Ireland has found that output and new business fell sharply in August, forcing companies to cut staff as business confidence hit a new low. Services sector firms, manufacturers, construction companies and farmers all reported that conditions worsened last month. This pulled the Ulster Bank Northern Ireland PMI down to 45.4 in August, a little higher than in July. This is the sixth month in a row that it has fallen below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. It\u2019s also much weaker than the UK average of 49.7, and shows that Brexit is hurting the Northern Ireland economy. The report\u2019s online here. Richard Ramsey, chief economist for Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, said Northern Ireland is the weakest-performing sector of the UK economy. \u201cThe latest PMI provides further evidence that Northern Ireland\u2019s private sector has entered, or is entering, recession. Output has fallen for the sixth month in a row and exports have declined for the seventh month. Add to this an eighth successive month of falling employment and it is hard to avoid this conclusion. \u201cAll four sectors monitored by the PMI are in decline for the fourth month running according to the latest survey. Perhaps the most concerning elements of August\u2019s report are the pace of deterioration in business conditions within the construction and manufacturing sectors. Construction orders plunged to an 81-month low and have now been falling consistently for 12 months. Within manufacturing, both output and orders continue to fall markedly, and significantly this is now impacting on staffing levels. Manufacturers posted their fastest rate of job losses in over seven years during August. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. GDP measures \u201cthings you can drop\u201d on your foot, as the old joke puts it. It\u2019s an imperfect measure of how a country is really performing, as it ignores our well-being and cannot distinguish good economic growth from bad. But, it\u2019s still our best guide to the monthly fluctuations in the economy. And today we\u2019ll learn whether Britain\u2019s economy has moved another step closer to recession over the summer. The UK July GDP report, due at 9.30am, is expected to show that Britain\u2019s economy contracted slightly in the May-July period. But in July alone, it may have expanded by 0.1%, perhaps helped by another burst of Brexit stockpiling. A month ago we learned that the UK shrank by 0.2% in April-June, putting us halfway into an official recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth). Today\u2019s report will show if the situation deteriorated in the third quarter of 2019. It will include new manufacturing data, which may show British industry stagnated during July. With business confidence weak, manufacturing output down and builders struggling, the economic picture is worrying - and depressingly reliant on consumer spending to keep the wheels moving. The twists and turns in the Brexit saga continue to weigh the economy down.Overnight, accountancy giant KPMG warned that a no-deal Brexit would drive Britain into its first recession since the financial crisis. These clouds of economic and political uncertainty are making it harder to tell what\u2019s really going on in the UK economy. The US-China trade war, and the slowdown in the eurozone, are also hurting growth. Daria Parkhomenko of RBC Capital Markets says forecasting UK growth is \u201cfraught with uncertainties at present.\u201d Our economists note that the Q1 outturn of 0.5% q/q was boosted by stockpiling by firms ahead of the end-of-March original Brexit date. The unwind of those efforts plus car plant shutdowns in April then dragged Q2 growth lower to -0.2% q/q. Those Brexit-induced distortions are also likely to affect Q3 GDP; whether stockpiling by firms resumes ahead of the new Brexit deadline of October 31 and how much of April\u2019s \u2018lost\u2019 car production will now take place in August will be major influences on Q3 GDP. The UK economy has slowed, but timing effects make it difficult to ascertain by how much.

      "body": "<h2>1) Historic times for men\u2019s tennis </h2> <p>Novak Djokovic arrived in New York with a shoulder injury, then Roger Federer suffered a stiff neck against Grigor Dimitrov. No matter. Rafael Nadal was there to represent the big three and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/08/rafael-nadal-daniil-medvedev-us-open-tennis-mens-final\" title=\"\">take his 19th grand slam title</a>, putting him one behind Federer. So much is on the line in these last years of their careers and each final seems to be laced with more historical significance than before. Had Nadal finished off Federer in the 2017 Australian Open final, he would already be the leader. Had Federer won one more point against Djokovic this summer at Wimbledon, he would have fended off his two rivals for a little longer. In the end none of this matters. They have faced each other so frequently over the past 14 years that by now everyone already knows whom they consider the best and no outcome will change minds. But it sure makes for a good story.</p> <h2>2) Bianca Andreescu is a mental giant</h2> <p>Days after Bianca Andreescu\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/bianca-andreescu-stuns-serena-williams-to-win-us-open-final\" title=\"\">first grand slam title at 19 years old</a>, it is still difficult to compute the scale of her achievements this year. Tennis has seen many sublime breakthroughs in the past but after winning Indian Wells then reaching the last 16 in Miami in March, Andreescu played only one match in four months. Lack of match fitness should be an impediment to success, yet she launched herself back in with a 14-match winning streak. She has not lost a completed match since 1 March. Andreescu is blessed with a varied and potent game but the most impressive aspect of her tournament was how well she played the big points. Until those final desperate games against Williams, not once did it seem as if she would falter in an important moment. She never did.</p> <h2>3) Daniil Medvedev will be back </h2> <p>After an exhausting summer of 20 wins in 22 matches Daniil Medvedev stood two sets and a break down to Rafael Nadal in a grand slam final, yet still had the audacity to believe he could win. The spirit and clarity that Medvedev showed as he turned the final round was confirmation that there is so much more to come. Despite rising in the rankings by grinding opponents down, in his first grand slam final he stepped closer to the baseline, took more risks and swept to the net 74 times in total. Over the past two years just about every other player of the 23-year-old\u2019s generation has been hyped as the next big thing. How refreshing that the biggest success has come to the player who quietly worked hard in the background, far from view.</p> <h2>4) Serena Williams has a block in finals</h2> <p>After spending much of recent press conferences plastering a fake smile on her face after defeats it was refreshing to see a frank and honest Serena Williams after losing to Andreescu. Though she showered praise on the young Canadian she clearly admires, Williams called her own play \u201cinexcusable\u201d. She was right. Williams had a great tournament and played high-quality tennis for six matches. She served well and moved better than she has since returning from childbirth, hitting cleanly throughout. But in the final, as Andreescu soared, Williams froze. Her figure of 37% first serves in the second set was pitiful. She has now lost four grand slam finals in a row without winning a single set and it is clear that her issues are mental. Unless she can learn how to play freely in these moments, her rivals have made it clear they will not let her breathe.</p> <h2>5) Johanna Konta is putting herself in good positions</h2> <p>Johanna Konta was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/03/johanna-konta-elina-svitolina-us-open-quarter-final\" title=\"\">ground down in straight sets</a> by Elina Svitolina but she had made another spirited run to the quarter-finals, beating the third seed, Karolina Pliskova, en route. She has now reached the last eight of each grand slam, a significant achievement. Konta is blessed with numerous strengths in her serve, groundstrokes and good movement, yet it is easy to see her as an overachiever who has eked much out of her inefficient technique and limited hand skills. Although she missed a golden opportunity to win a grand slam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/07/johanna-konta-errors-hands-french-open-tennis-semi-final-marketa-vondrousova\" title=\"\">at the French Open this year</a>, she keeps on putting herself in the right positions. Future draws could break open for her again.</p>",

Or perhaps just a sweaty little man (they are almost always men) trying gamely to placate a party of sugar-high six-year-olds with balloons while their parents slip out the back?</p> <p>With its razzmatazz, secrecy and ritualised trickery, being a magician is not a calling most associate with a social conscience. But there is an intellectual dimension to magic that was already old the first time someone thought of putting an egg into a bag and then making it disappear (believed to be in the 16th century). Good magicians have always understood and exploited the psychological blind spots of their audience. In 1876, a magician known as Professor Hoffmann collected a series of articles he had written for a popular boys\u2019 magazine into a book, Modern Magic, which explained how classic tricks were performed. \u201cHe believed young people should learn to perform magic because it would be useful in their professional lives and in the furtherance of the British empire,\u201d one present-day acolyte, Will Houstoun, tells me. \u201cMagic teaches you to stand in front of a room and talk, problem-solve, deceive and spot deception.\u201d</p> <p>Today, the practical applications of magic are being used by a new generation to conjure up a better world.</p> <h2><strong>The \u2018magic humanitarian\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jamie Balfour-Paul</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fbbf16a9799edb402d65507a37299c498640f235\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbbf16a9799edb402d65507a37299c498640f235/0_188_6861_4117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Balfour-Paul \u2026 \u2018In Lebanon, if you don\u2019t have a rabbit, you might as well go home.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Balfour-Paul \u2026 \u2018In Lebanon, if you don\u2019t have a rabbit, you might as well go home.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Balfour-Paul, AKA Jamie Jibberish, is a former charity worker who works his magic on some of the world\u2019s most deprived children in refugee camps around the Middle East and the north of Africa. He travels with little except an ornate wooden box he picked up years ago in Egypt. \u201cI try to make a point of getting everything into that box, and I choose props based on familiarity \u2013 newspapers, bottles, ropes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in Lebanon [where he is based], if you don\u2019t have a rabbit, you might as well go home.\u201d At one point he had three of them hopping around his Beirut flat because they kept growing too big to fit into a hat.</p> <p>A shy man, he comes alive when swallowing a balloon or pulling a multicoloured streamer from his mouth, but his first charity job was as a volunteer agricultural adviser on a tree-planting scheme in Palestine. After rising up the ranks into management, he decided he wanted to return to working directly with the people he had set out to help.</p> <p>Now he has set up a charity called <a href=\"https://magicforsmiles.com/\" title=\"\">Magic for Smiles</a>. \u201c\u2018Psychosocial\u2019 is a bit of a buzzword. But being in a community where your parents don\u2019t have any status, and you can\u2019t play because it\u2019s quite cramped, is very stressful. There\u2019s obviously happiness and de-stressing through entertainment, but magic also helps with concentration, creativity and interaction. Funding is a problem, and it\u2019s quite a lonely life; just me and my bunnies driving around. But it\u2019s worth it to see the children\u2019s faces light up.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Magicians in residence at Cambridge University</strong></h2> <p><strong>Clive Wilkins and Nicky Clayton</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6363482227d353c4a5b1d7c68e2232c50d29c64b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6363482227d353c4a5b1d7c68e2232c50d29c64b/346_321_5012_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clive Wilkins and Nicky Clayton \u2026 \u2018Maybe we can trick ourselves into seeing further.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clive Wilkins and Nicky Clayton \u2026 \u2018Maybe we can trick ourselves into seeing further.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPick a number between one and 100,\u201d says Clive Wilkins. So I do, but don\u2019t tell him which one. For him and his professional partner, Nicky Clayton, magic is no less than a portal to the future. Clayton is a professor of comparative cognition in the psychology department at Cambridge University, where Wilkins \u2013 an artist and novelist as well as a magician \u2013 has a permanent residency. The pair met at a tango class and are never seen abroad together without identical homburg hats.</p> <p>But their showbizzy style conceals a serious academic purpose, which they are promoting around the world in illustrated lectures designed to fundamentally challenge the way people think (next stops: China and Germany). \u201cThe argument we have been developing is that magic reveals a number of interesting roadblocks in our thinking,\u201d says Clayton. Such as? \u201cThere\u2019s egocentric bias \u2013 where we think others see and think more like us than they really do; and confirmation bias, where we see what we expect to see, so can miss the most obvious things. Magic capitalises on these blind spots in our thinking; magic occurs in the mind of the spectator, not the hands of the magician.\u201d</p> <p>Wilkins seamlessly picks up the baton: \u201cWe suggest that the human brain has been very good at creating civilisation over the last millennia, but in a postmodern world, scientists and artists are wondering what the next development is going to be. Perhaps the way forward is to find some alternative way of seeing. Maybe we can trick ourselves into seeing further. We have to see over and above ourselves.\u201d With that, he waves a piece of paper in my face. It reads \u201c46\u201d, the number I had almost forgotten I picked. I leave with the roadblocks rattling in my brain.</p> <h2><strong>The student magician</strong></h2> <p><strong>Cat Lee</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4be1c700bb1aad0684bcf6d0ab55ddb3e7bdcccf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4be1c700bb1aad0684bcf6d0ab55ddb3e7bdcccf/0_83_5001_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cat Lee \u2026 \u2018Now I am who I am, and I can never thank them enough.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cat Lee \u2026 \u2018Now I am who I am, and I can never thank them enough.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Eaton/Breathe Magic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt 19, I couldn\u2019t cook or pour a drink. I\u2019d never eaten with a knife and fork. It\u2019s really embarrassing on a date to ask: \u2018Please can you cut up my food?\u2019\u201d says Cat Lee, who is based in Merseyside. She is now a poised 22-year-old law graduate, but is more interested in developing her modelling career than pursuing a legal career. Part of the thrill of it, she says, is that her bookers don\u2019t know she has cerebral palsy.</p> <p>The turning point in her life came when her mother signed her up for a summer camp for young people with hemiplegia, a condition that leaves one side of the body incapacitated, and can be caused by stroke, epilepsy or a head injury, as well as cerebral palsy. The camps are run by Breathe Arts Health Research, a charity set up more than a decade ago by a group of magicians who believed the dexterity used in magic tricks could be used therapeutically to help young people who had little support from the health system.</p> <p>Working with occupational therapists from a London hospital, they discovered that some children could make life-changing progress in coordination \u2013 and confidence \u2013 in just a fortnight. Its co-founder David Owen (who is also a barrister) demonstrates a trick \u2013 the mystery of the jumping coins \u2013 in which money appears to leap from one place to another. Repeating it in slow motion, he shows how it involves a series of 10 movements, from pinching the coins to pick them up to pressing both palms flat on the table and turning hands over together and separately. \u201cIt\u2019s a professional-level piece of magic that some children master and others don\u2019t, but for all of them, it is building skills that most of us take for granted,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Cat was one of their successes, who left the 10-day course capable of building an independent life and is now a mentor, encouraging younger children at the camps. She doesn\u2019t do magic tricks herself, but uses the props to exercise her hands. She credits the performance skills she learned with enabling her to overcome her physical difficulties and the resulting psychological ones. Her tears well up as she recalls the camp\u2019s impact on her life. \u201cNow I am who I am, and I can never thank them enough.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The medical magician and the surgeon</strong></h2> <p><strong>Will Houstoun and Roger Kneebone</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e25a2c16ef13f2e690f88cd9b138f2d0a56a3742\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e25a2c16ef13f2e690f88cd9b138f2d0a56a3742/0_89_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Kneebone and Will Houstoun \u2026 \u2018I realised there were far deeper parallels around capturing and managing attention.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Kneebone and Will Houstoun \u2026 \u2018I realised there were far deeper parallels around capturing and managing attention.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a student, I saw medicine as a science. As a surgeon, I saw it as a skill. As a GP, I saw it much more as a performance, and as a patient, I see it as all three,\u201d says Prof Roger Kneebone. He is sitting in the cafe at the Wellcome Trust in London. Opposite him is a younger man whose gaze is steady and intense, and whose hands are in constant motion, flicking and cutting a pack of playing cards.</p> <p>Kneebone runs a master\u2019s course in surgical education at Imperial College, and the man with him is Will Houstoun, one of the UK\u2019s leading closeup magicians and editor of the Magic Circle\u2019s house magazine, the Magic Circular. Five years ago, they started working together to investigate the parallels between magic and surgery.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, I was looking at dexterity, as both involve sleight of hand,\u201d says Kneebone, \u201cbut most of a surgeon\u2019s time isn\u2019t spent in the operating theatre, and I realised there were far deeper parallels around capturing and managing attention.\u201d He set up a radical department of performance science and appointed Houstoun its magician in residence, and they began to give joint lectures.</p> <p>Magicians are, by necessity, secretive, Houstoun says, but there is a separation between a magic trick and the techniques used to make it work \u2013 such as how to create a theatrically exaggerated state that looks natural, and shift attention with your gaze. \u201cIf you want someone to look at an object, look at it. If you want them to look at you, look at them.\u201d He illustrates his point with a baffling three-coin vanishing trick.</p> <p>A medical consultation is a complicated process in which a surgeon has to listen to a patient while simultaneously making judgments and taking clinical notes. The ability to create a connection \u2013 to hold that patient in thrall \u2013 hasn\u2019t traditionally been considered part of a surgeon\u2019s skill set, yet it is as important to clinical practice as it is to a magic show, they explain.

      "bodyText": "What image does the word \u201cmagic\u201d conjure up? Paul Daniels sawing Debbie McGee in half, or Harry Potter chanting \u201cExpecto patronum\u201d? Or perhaps just a sweaty little man (they are almost always men) trying gamely to placate a party of sugar-high six-year-olds with balloons while their parents slip out the back? With its razzmatazz, secrecy and ritualised trickery, being a magician is not a calling most associate with a social conscience. But there is an intellectual dimension to magic that was already old the first time someone thought of putting an egg into a bag and then making it disappear (believed to be in the 16th century). Good magicians have always understood and exploited the psychological blind spots of their audience. In 1876, a magician known as Professor Hoffmann collected a series of articles he had written for a popular boys\u2019 magazine into a book, Modern Magic, which explained how classic tricks were performed. \u201cHe believed young people should learn to perform magic because it would be useful in their professional lives and in the furtherance of the British empire,\u201d one present-day acolyte, Will Houstoun, tells me. \u201cMagic teaches you to stand in front of a room and talk, problem-solve, deceive and spot deception.\u201d Today, the practical applications of magic are being used by a new generation to conjure up a better world. The \u2018magic humanitarian\u2019 Jamie Balfour-Paul Balfour-Paul, AKA Jamie Jibberish, is a former charity worker who works his magic on some of the world\u2019s most deprived children in refugee camps around the Middle East and the north of Africa. He travels with little except an ornate wooden box he picked up years ago in Egypt. \u201cI try to make a point of getting everything into that box, and I choose props based on familiarity \u2013 newspapers, bottles, ropes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in Lebanon [where he is based], if you don\u2019t have a rabbit, you might as well go home.\u201d At one point he had three of them hopping around his Beirut flat because they kept growing too big to fit into a hat. A shy man, he comes alive when swallowing a balloon or pulling a multicoloured streamer from his mouth, but his first charity job was as a volunteer agricultural adviser on a tree-planting scheme in Palestine. After rising up the ranks into management, he decided he wanted to return to working directly with the people he had set out to help. Now he has set up a charity called Magic for Smiles. \u201c\u2018Psychosocial\u2019 is a bit of a buzzword. But being in a community where your parents don\u2019t have any status, and you can\u2019t play because it\u2019s quite cramped, is very stressful. There\u2019s obviously happiness and de-stressing through entertainment, but magic also helps with concentration, creativity and interaction. Funding is a problem, and it\u2019s quite a lonely life; just me and my bunnies driving around. But it\u2019s worth it to see the children\u2019s faces light up.\u201d Magicians in residence at Cambridge University Clive Wilkins and Nicky Clayton \u201cPick a number between one and 100,\u201d says Clive Wilkins. So I do, but don\u2019t tell him which one. For him and his professional partner, Nicky Clayton, magic is no less than a portal to the future. Clayton is a professor of comparative cognition in the psychology department at Cambridge University, where Wilkins \u2013 an artist and novelist as well as a magician \u2013 has a permanent residency. The pair met at a tango class and are never seen abroad together without identical homburg hats. But their showbizzy style conceals a serious academic purpose, which they are promoting around the world in illustrated lectures designed to fundamentally challenge the way people think (next stops: China and Germany). \u201cThe argument we have been developing is that magic reveals a number of interesting roadblocks in our thinking,\u201d says Clayton. Such as? \u201cThere\u2019s egocentric bias \u2013 where we think others see and think more like us than they really do; and confirmation bias, where we see what we expect to see, so can miss the most obvious things. Magic capitalises on these blind spots in our thinking; magic occurs in the mind of the spectator, not the hands of the magician.\u201d Wilkins seamlessly picks up the baton: \u201cWe suggest that the human brain has been very good at creating civilisation over the last millennia, but in a postmodern world, scientists and artists are wondering what the next development is going to be. Perhaps the way forward is to find some alternative way of seeing. Maybe we can trick ourselves into seeing further. We have to see over and above ourselves.\u201d With that, he waves a piece of paper in my face. It reads \u201c46\u201d, the number I had almost forgotten I picked. I leave with the roadblocks rattling in my brain. The student magician Cat Lee \u201cAt 19, I couldn\u2019t cook or pour a drink. I\u2019d never eaten with a knife and fork. It\u2019s really embarrassing on a date to ask: \u2018Please can you cut up my food?\u2019\u201d says Cat Lee, who is based in Merseyside. She is now a poised 22-year-old law graduate, but is more interested in developing her modelling career than pursuing a legal career. Part of the thrill of it, she says, is that her bookers don\u2019t know she has cerebral palsy. The turning point in her life came when her mother signed her up for a summer camp for young people with hemiplegia, a condition that leaves one side of the body incapacitated, and can be caused by stroke, epilepsy or a head injury, as well as cerebral palsy. The camps are run by Breathe Arts Health Research, a charity set up more than a decade ago by a group of magicians who believed the dexterity used in magic tricks could be used therapeutically to help young people who had little support from the health system. Working with occupational therapists from a London hospital, they discovered that some children could make life-changing progress in coordination \u2013 and confidence \u2013 in just a fortnight. Its co-founder David Owen (who is also a barrister) demonstrates a trick \u2013 the mystery of the jumping coins \u2013 in which money appears to leap from one place to another. Repeating it in slow motion, he shows how it involves a series of 10 movements, from pinching the coins to pick them up to pressing both palms flat on the table and turning hands over together and separately. \u201cIt\u2019s a professional-level piece of magic that some children master and others don\u2019t, but for all of them, it is building skills that most of us take for granted,\u201d he says. Cat was one of their successes, who left the 10-day course capable of building an independent life and is now a mentor, encouraging younger children at the camps. She doesn\u2019t do magic tricks herself, but uses the props to exercise her hands. She credits the performance skills she learned with enabling her to overcome her physical difficulties and the resulting psychological ones. Her tears well up as she recalls the camp\u2019s impact on her life. \u201cNow I am who I am, and I can never thank them enough.\u201d The medical magician and the surgeon Will Houstoun and Roger Kneebone \u201cAs a student, I saw medicine as a science. As a surgeon, I saw it as a skill. As a GP, I saw it much more as a performance, and as a patient, I see it as all three,\u201d says Prof Roger Kneebone. He is sitting in the cafe at the Wellcome Trust in London. Opposite him is a younger man whose gaze is steady and intense, and whose hands are in constant motion, flicking and cutting a pack of playing cards. Kneebone runs a master\u2019s course in surgical education at Imperial College, and the man with him is Will Houstoun, one of the UK\u2019s leading closeup magicians and editor of the Magic Circle\u2019s house magazine, the Magic Circular. Five years ago, they started working together to investigate the parallels between magic and surgery. \u201cFirst, I was looking at dexterity, as both involve sleight of hand,\u201d says Kneebone, \u201cbut most of a surgeon\u2019s time isn\u2019t spent in the operating theatre, and I realised there were far deeper parallels around capturing and managing attention.\u201d He set up a radical department of performance science and appointed Houstoun its magician in residence, and they began to give joint lectures. Magicians are, by necessity, secretive, Houstoun says, but there is a separation between a magic trick and the techniques used to make it work \u2013 such as how to create a theatrically exaggerated state that looks natural, and shift attention with your gaze. \u201cIf you want someone to look at an object, look at it. If you want them to look at you, look at them.\u201d He illustrates his point with a baffling three-coin vanishing trick. A medical consultation is a complicated process in which a surgeon has to listen to a patient while simultaneously making judgments and taking clinical notes. The ability to create a connection \u2013 to hold that patient in thrall \u2013 hasn\u2019t traditionally been considered part of a surgeon\u2019s skill set, yet it is as important to clinical practice as it is to a magic show, they explain. For the patient, it\u2019s the difference between feeling heard, and safe, or just another statistic, another chore. \u201cMagic doesn\u2019t work if you do it at people and neither does medicine,\u201d says Kneebone. \u201cA medical consultation is all about dual narratives: what is really going on and what seems to be going on, so even if you\u2019re delivering bad news, the patient has a sense they are further on.\u201d The magic special needs teacher Goldie Puricelli \u201cMy whole interest in magic came from an interaction with a 16-year-old autistic boy,\u201d says Goldie Puricelli. \u201cHe was into magic, so I learned a trick out of a cracker and when I showed it to him, it sparked concentration.

As well as enabling students to access work experience that they might otherwise lack the confidence or opportunity to pursue, it\u2019s also a way for employers to do something proactive in relation to diversifying their workforce. \u201cWe also thought about the employers we\u2019re engaging with, or with whom we want to engage, who find it difficult to access the talent and skills they need to support the growth of their organisation,\u201d says Laws. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s not enough for organisations to say they are committed to diversity \u2013 this is a tangible opportunity to engage with students who might be harder to reach or who might not consider themselves eligible for the kind of opportunities on offer.\u201d Because businesses can access graduates\u2019 skills and talents from afar, there\u2019s no need for the individual to live in the same city or town. \u201cOur distance-learning model is another reason why we\u2019re a great partner for SMEs \u2013 it\u2019s what we know and do best, so we can provide organisations, particularly those less familiar with remote working, with lots of support,\u201d says Laws. This includes sharing the approaches and tactics that the OU uses as a distance-learning provider to maintain contact with students to help them to feel part of the OU community. Alongside the virtual internships programme, the OU also runs a Santander SME internship scheme, exclusively for SMEs, which enables the OU to pay for or partially fund a student\u2019s internship. Seventy-five percent of OU students are in full or part-time employment \u2013 another indication of how different its student population is compared with traditional bricks-and-mortar universities \u2013 so many students opt to do placements on a part-time basis to enable them to continue with existing work commitments. The OU recently commissioned independent research among employers of OU graduates. Employers felt they benefited from the fact many OU students work while studying. It means they already have workplace skills and, as one employer put it, are ready to \u201chit the ground running\u201d. In light of all we know about the positive impact of flexible working on everything from productivity to mental health, the OU\u2019s approach seems destined to foster change in the workplace. \u201cThe demand for flexible working is only likely to increase in the future, so for businesses that want to stay ahead of the curve, our virtual internships programme is a good opportunity to test out that style of working,\u201d says Laws. It\u2019s also a golden opportunity for OU students. \u201cChanging career, whether in your 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s or even 60s, can be very daunting, but a virtual internship could open doors for someone who might otherwise lack the confidence to try breaking into a new industry,\u201d says Laws. \u201cOur virtual internships enable small businesses to offer graduates that game-changing first step.\u201d Empower your business. It\u2019s easy and free to tap into the diverse talents of OU students and alumni through the OU\u2019s OpportunityHub",

Oliver attributed this stalemate to the legislative tool known as the filibuster.</p> <p>Though technically any measure used to block legislation, the modern filibuster has become, according to Oliver, an \u201coverused tool of obstruction\u201d that, in practical terms, requires 60 votes to pass a bill instead of regular majority rule.

Never mind the fact, Oliver refuted, that senators routinely pulled guns on each other in the 19th century, or that the \u201cminorities\u201d referred to were political minorities \u2013 traditionally southern senators \u2013 who used the filibuster to restrict the rights of racial minorities and to block civil rights legislation. To this day, the longest speaking filibuster belongs to the notoriously racist Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who spoke against a civil rights bill in 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes straight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/sep/06/seth-meyers-hurricane-dorian-trump-stephen-colbert-trevor-noah\">Seth Meyers: 'Unlike hurricanes, every day Trump blows harder'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Senate stopped requiring speaking filibusters in the 1970s; now, signaling intent to filibuster is enough to stop a bill. But that hasn\u2019t stopped senators from turning the now accessory speech into a publicity stunt; Oliver pointed to a speech delivered by Ted Cruz in 2013 to filibuster funding for the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWhen you watch this, remember: the stated argument for this tactic is, it\u2019s supposed to be a vital means of facilitating a full and robust debate,\u201d Oliver said before playing a clip of the speech in which Cruz simply read Dr Seuss\u2019s Green Eggs &amp; Ham with lofty rhetorical flair.</p> <p>Finally, some have argued that the filibuster encourages bipartisanship, which is clearly not the case, Oliver said, despite its increasing use. \u201cThanks to the filibuster, many pieces of meaningful legislation, some with bipartisan support, have died,\u201d including a bipartisan gun control bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and the public option in Obamacare.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where senators don\u2019t so much brag about what they\u2019ve passed as brag about what they are going to obstruct,\u201d Oliver lamented. So why keep the filibuster? Democratic candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Steve Bullock have called for it to be abolished \u2013 but so has Trump. Removing the filibuster is certainly a risk given the shifting winds of power, Oliver acknowledged; the idea of giving up a potential defense against Trump\u2019s policies is a bitter pill, but \u201cit should not come at the cost of getting anything done\u201d.</p> <p>So Oliver ended with his own stunt: the filibuster against the filibuster, in which he packed 15 hours of speechifying into one minute behind a podium. Just as people used to sip coffee from a saucer, Oliver railed, some people \u201cused to think [the filibuster] was a good idea. But at some point, someone needs to ask: does this make sense? Or is it just incredibly fucking stupid?\u201d</p>",

But that hasn\u2019t stopped senators from turning the now accessory speech into a publicity stunt; Oliver pointed to a speech delivered by Ted Cruz in 2013 to filibuster funding for the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWhen you watch this, remember: the stated argument for this tactic is, it\u2019s supposed to be a vital means of facilitating a full and robust debate,\u201d Oliver said before playing a clip of the speech in which Cruz simply read Dr Seuss\u2019s Green Eggs &amp; Ham with lofty rhetorical flair. Finally, some have argued that the filibuster encourages bipartisanship, which is clearly not the case, Oliver said, despite its increasing use. \u201cThanks to the filibuster, many pieces of meaningful legislation, some with bipartisan support, have died,\u201d including a bipartisan gun control bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and the public option in Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where senators don\u2019t so much brag about what they\u2019ve passed as brag about what they are going to obstruct,\u201d Oliver lamented. So why keep the filibuster? Democratic candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Steve Bullock have called for it to be abolished \u2013 but so has Trump. Removing the filibuster is certainly a risk given the shifting winds of power, Oliver acknowledged; the idea of giving up a potential defense against Trump\u2019s policies is a bitter pill, but \u201cit should not come at the cost of getting anything done\u201d. So Oliver ended with his own stunt: the filibuster against the filibuster, in which he packed 15 hours of speechifying into one minute behind a podium. Just as people used to sip coffee from a saucer, Oliver railed, some people \u201cused to think [the filibuster] was a good idea. But at some point, someone needs to ask: does this make sense? Or is it just incredibly fucking stupid?\u201d",

In 1881, the women organized a strike for higher wages \u2013 $1 for every dozen pounds of laundry \u2013 and greater autonomy over their industry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/29/us-teacher-strikes-generated-victories-so-why-are-they-ready-to-strike-again\">US teacher strikes generated victories. So why are they ready to strike again?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMost would have said what they were attempting to do was impossible,\u201d Nelson said, her voice wavering.</p> <p>\u201cThere were no labor laws to protect them. There was no single employer with whom they could negotiate, and their low-skilled work could easily be taken over by others.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the women persisted and, against the odds, prevailed. Militancy \u2013 and sometimes just the threat of it \u2013 can work even in the most dire circumstances, Nelson said. It\u2019s a principle she believes in deeply.</p> <p>For many, Nelson represents the new face of labor. With manufacturing and mining on a long-term decline, unions have concentrated their battles on the service sector. Teachers\u2019 strikes and efforts to unionize fast food and hotel workers in the Fight for $15 movement \u2013 sectors dominated by women \u2013 have shown unions still have a role.</p> <p>Earlier this year, staring down the longest government shutdown in US history, Nelson gained national attention when she called for a general strike as a way of pressuring Donald Trump and Congress to act. The idea was radical \u2013 and supporters say it set in motion a series of events that brought the weeks-long shutdown to an end.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think power is a limited resource,\u201d she said in Atlanta. \u201cBut using power builds power.\u201d</p> <p>Nelson has struck a chord with progressives and grassroots activists who have amplified calls for her to run for labor\u2019s top job: president of the nation\u2019s largest federation of unions, the 12.5 million-member AFL-CIO.</p> <p>\u201cShe knows how to excite people and how to give them the sense that a lot more is possible,\u201d said Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America, of which AFA is an affiliate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14b474baa2534d766dcfd0bae4d222325448a2cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14b474baa2534d766dcfd0bae4d222325448a2cb/0_322_3736_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Nelson speaks at a press conference in Arlington, Virginia, on 24 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sara Nelson speaks at a press conference in Arlington, Virginia, on 24 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The unofficial race to succeed Richard Trumka as president of AFL-CIO is taking place mostly behind the scenes at this stage. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/afl-cio-liz-shuler-sara-nelson-unions-leadership\">longtime labor journalist Steven Greenhouse</a> reported that Nelson and Liz Shuler, the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, are already vying for the role.</p> <p>Nelson said she finds the prospect of leading the federation \u201cintriguing\u201d and \u201cexciting\u201d. But she stopped short of declaring her intention to run, concerned that a protracted leadership contest might distract from the challenges facing organized labor.</p> <p>\u201cI would love to be a part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can tell you that for sure. But I think it is too far off and we have too many battles.\u201d</p> <p>Decades of well-funded political opposition and a string of legal setbacks have decimated organized labor in America. The share of US workers covered by unions has fallen dramatically from more than 30% in the mid-20th century to <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/union-membership-rate-10-point-5-percent-in-2018-down-from-20-point-1-percent-in-1983.htm?view_full\">10.5% in 2018</a>, a historic low. At the same time, wages for low-income workers have stagnated, while productivity increases, corporate profits soar and income inequality rises.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason that we have this level of inequality is not a mistake,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt is the result of very well-planned, aggressive steps taken by the right to destroy the labor movement and to take that check in our democracy away. And they almost succeeded.\u201d</p> <p>A 2018 supreme court decision that stripped public sector unions of their ability to collect \u201cfair-share fees\u201d from non-union members \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/27/supreme-court-unions-fair-share-ruling\">Janus v</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/27/supreme-court-unions-fair-share-ruling\"> AFSCME</a> \u2013 was supposed to be the death knell of American labor. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/08/us-unions-janus-supreme-court-koch-brothers\">it wasn\u2019t</a>.</p> <p>There are signs the ruling reinvigorated organizing campaigns, which has emboldened the labor movement and led to gains for some unions. A Gallup poll released this month found Americans support for unions at 64%, approaching a<a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/265916/labor-day-turns-125-union-approval-near-year-high.aspx\"> 50-year high</a>.</p> <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the movement is drawing fresh energy from a wave of worker uprisings across the country. In the past 18 months, teachers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/west-virginia-teachers-strike-workers-rights\">West Virginia</a>, Oklahoma and Arizona, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/4/18125505/marriott-workers-end-strike-wage-raise\">Marriott hotel workers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/15/stop-shop-strike-new-england-elizabeth-warren\">Stop &amp; Shop supermarket employees</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/27/california-uber-and-lyft-drivers-rally-for-bill-granting-rights-to-contract-workers\">Uber and Lyft drivers</a> have challenged their bosses with strikes and protest to demand higher wages and better working conditions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a hunger for the people to rise up</p> <footer> <cite>Randi Weingarten</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is a hunger for the people to rise up,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe all have that hunger. We do that through politics and we do that through collective action but at the same time the question has to be: what\u2019s the next step?\u201d</p> <p>For Nelson, the next step is to build alliances. In May, she joined the United Mine Workers of America at a rally on Capitol Hill to urge Congress to pass legislation to protect coalminers\u2019 pensions.</p> <p>The spectacle of flight attendants in their pressed uniforms and knotted neck scarves standing in solidarity with miners wearing camouflage print union shirts was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWDQ0s9Qcj4\">fairly unusual</a>\u201d, conceded Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers. But this is what Nelson says she means when she talks about worker \u201csolidarity\u201d. </p> <p>As the head of the AFA, she has worked to forge relationships with labor groups in other industries. Nelson argues that if workers join forces over wages and working conditions, they are less likely to be swayed by Trump\u2019s efforts to divide them by race, culture and identity.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is born with sexism, racism, ageism in their heart,\u201d Nelson said in her Atlanta speech. \u201cThese are the tactics of the boss, of those who want all the money and all the power to deny us solidarity, the greatest force for good. Expose it. Call it out. Deal with it. And in our unions and on our picket lines we can do exactly that.\u201d</p> <p>As the head of a union that represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, Nelson has been a part of some of the biggest cultural movements and political fights. In the wake of #MeToo, she <a href=\"https://www.afacwa.org/afa_metoo_testimony\">testified</a> to Congress that roughly three in four flight attendants experienced sexual harassment during their flying career. Leaders of an industry that once imposed age and weight restrictions on flight attendants must do more to combat sexual harassment in the workplace, she told lawmakers.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2019/03/23/how-flight-attendant-texas-ended-up-an-ice-detention-center-six-weeks/\">her union spr</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2019/03/23/how-flight-attendant-texas-ended-up-an-ice-detention-center-six-weeks/\">ang to action</a> with a petition and media campaign to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FlyingWithSara/status/1109180825323528192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1109196245015252992&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fimmigration%2F2019%2F03%2F23%2Fhow-flight-attendant-texas-ended-up-an-ice-detention-center-six-weeks%2F\">release</a> a flight attendant who was detained for weeks by immigration officials in Texas after working a flight to Mexico because of her status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. And Nelson has also been a vocal critic of Boeing in the wake of two 737 Max jet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/ethiopian-flight-302-second-new-boeing-737-max-8-to-crash-in-four-months\">crashes</a>, that killed hundreds of people and led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/ethiopian-airlines-crash-canada-grounds-737-max-us-stands-alone\">the plane\u2019s grounding</a>.

But today\u2019s labor leaders, facing entrenched opposition to organizing and collective bargaining, have been forced to find creative ways to build power in a hostile legal environment.</p> <p>\u201cNelson knows her history. She knows that unions and working people build power without having the law on their side and without accommodating or bowing to the interest of companies,\u201d said Rebecca Givan, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. \u201cBut clearly she believes there is value in reviving some of those strategies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The labor movement is not something that we have to rebuild. The structure already exists</p> <footer> <cite>Sara Nelson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe labor movement is not something that we have to rebuild,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThe structure already exists,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that has to be put into fourth gear and supercharged.\u201d</p> <p>The 2020 presidential race will be a test of labor\u2019s political clout as the Democratic candidates fiercely <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2019/08/19/democratic-presidential-candidates-2020-dems-iowa-union-voters-caucus-afscme-afl-cio-election-trump/2007440001/\">compete</a> for their support. There is a diversity of political views among the union ranks, as demonstrated by a debate over how best to expand health coverage.</p> <p>Nelson is a vocal supporter of a Medicare for All single-payer healthcare system.

      "bodyText": "Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union (AFA-CWA) and an emerging force in an energized labor movement, had the foot soldiers of the left\u2019s budding \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d in tears. She was speaking at the Democratic Socialists of America\u2019s biennial convention in Atlanta last month and began with a story from the early history of American workers\u2019 rights. A fast-rising star \u2013 and a woman tipped for the very top of the US labor movement \u2013 Nelson described a small band of laundresses in Atlanta, all black women, many of them former slaves, who formed the Washing Society. In 1881, the women organized a strike for higher wages \u2013 $1 for every dozen pounds of laundry \u2013 and greater autonomy over their industry. \u201cMost would have said what they were attempting to do was impossible,\u201d Nelson said, her voice wavering. \u201cThere were no labor laws to protect them. There was no single employer with whom they could negotiate, and their low-skilled work could easily be taken over by others.\u201d Yet the women persisted and, against the odds, prevailed. Militancy \u2013 and sometimes just the threat of it \u2013 can work even in the most dire circumstances, Nelson said. It\u2019s a principle she believes in deeply. For many, Nelson represents the new face of labor. With manufacturing and mining on a long-term decline, unions have concentrated their battles on the service sector. Teachers\u2019 strikes and efforts to unionize fast food and hotel workers in the Fight for $15 movement \u2013 sectors dominated by women \u2013 have shown unions still have a role. Earlier this year, staring down the longest government shutdown in US history, Nelson gained national attention when she called for a general strike as a way of pressuring Donald Trump and Congress to act. The idea was radical \u2013 and supporters say it set in motion a series of events that brought the weeks-long shutdown to an end. \u201cPeople think power is a limited resource,\u201d she said in Atlanta. \u201cBut using power builds power.\u201d Nelson has struck a chord with progressives and grassroots activists who have amplified calls for her to run for labor\u2019s top job: president of the nation\u2019s largest federation of unions, the 12.5 million-member AFL-CIO. \u201cShe knows how to excite people and how to give them the sense that a lot more is possible,\u201d said Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America, of which AFA is an affiliate. The unofficial race to succeed Richard Trumka as president of AFL-CIO is taking place mostly behind the scenes at this stage. But the longtime labor journalist Steven Greenhouse reported that Nelson and Liz Shuler, the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, are already vying for the role. Nelson said she finds the prospect of leading the federation \u201cintriguing\u201d and \u201cexciting\u201d. But she stopped short of declaring her intention to run, concerned that a protracted leadership contest might distract from the challenges facing organized labor. \u201cI would love to be a part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can tell you that for sure. But I think it is too far off and we have too many battles.\u201d Decades of well-funded political opposition and a string of legal setbacks have decimated organized labor in America. The share of US workers covered by unions has fallen dramatically from more than 30% in the mid-20th century to 10.5% in 2018, a historic low. At the same time, wages for low-income workers have stagnated, while productivity increases, corporate profits soar and income inequality rises. \u201cThe reason that we have this level of inequality is not a mistake,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt is the result of very well-planned, aggressive steps taken by the right to destroy the labor movement and to take that check in our democracy away. And they almost succeeded.\u201d A 2018 supreme court decision that stripped public sector unions of their ability to collect \u201cfair-share fees\u201d from non-union members \u2013 Janus v AFSCME \u2013 was supposed to be the death knell of American labor. But it wasn\u2019t. There are signs the ruling reinvigorated organizing campaigns, which has emboldened the labor movement and led to gains for some unions. A Gallup poll released this month found Americans support for unions at 64%, approaching a 50-year high. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the movement is drawing fresh energy from a wave of worker uprisings across the country. In the past 18 months, teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona, Marriott hotel workers, Stop &amp; Shop supermarket employees and Uber and Lyft drivers have challenged their bosses with strikes and protest to demand higher wages and better working conditions. \u201cThere is a hunger for the people to rise up,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe all have that hunger. We do that through politics and we do that through collective action but at the same time the question has to be: what\u2019s the next step?\u201d For Nelson, the next step is to build alliances. In May, she joined the United Mine Workers of America at a rally on Capitol Hill to urge Congress to pass legislation to protect coalminers\u2019 pensions. The spectacle of flight attendants in their pressed uniforms and knotted neck scarves standing in solidarity with miners wearing camouflage print union shirts was \u201cfairly unusual\u201d, conceded Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers. But this is what Nelson says she means when she talks about worker \u201csolidarity\u201d. As the head of the AFA, she has worked to forge relationships with labor groups in other industries. Nelson argues that if workers join forces over wages and working conditions, they are less likely to be swayed by Trump\u2019s efforts to divide them by race, culture and identity. \u201cNo one is born with sexism, racism, ageism in their heart,\u201d Nelson said in her Atlanta speech. \u201cThese are the tactics of the boss, of those who want all the money and all the power to deny us solidarity, the greatest force for good. Expose it. Call it out. Deal with it. And in our unions and on our picket lines we can do exactly that.\u201d As the head of a union that represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, Nelson has been a part of some of the biggest cultural movements and political fights. In the wake of #MeToo, she testified to Congress that roughly three in four flight attendants experienced sexual harassment during their flying career. Leaders of an industry that once imposed age and weight restrictions on flight attendants must do more to combat sexual harassment in the workplace, she told lawmakers. Earlier this year, her union sprang to action with a petition and media campaign to release a flight attendant who was detained for weeks by immigration officials in Texas after working a flight to Mexico because of her status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. And Nelson has also been a vocal critic of Boeing in the wake of two 737 Max jet crashes, that killed hundreds of people and led to the plane\u2019s grounding. In June, she told a congressional panel that her union had noticed a \u201cchastened tone\u201d from the company. \u201cWhat Sara Nelson offers is a different kind of labor movement,\u201d said Erik Loomis, a labor historian at the University of Rhode Island and the author of A History of America in 10 Strikes. \u201cOne that is, for the first time in a long time, charismatic and inspiring and one that speaks not only to current labor union members but also to the vast majority of the American working class that doesn\u2019t belong to a union, or can\u2019t have a union, or where it\u2019s really difficult to form a union.\u201d Nelson\u2019s embrace of militant tactics \u2013 and her reputation as a fierce negotiator \u2013 has drawn comparisons to the tough-talking, cigar-smoking union bosses of labor\u2019s golden era. But today\u2019s labor leaders, facing entrenched opposition to organizing and collective bargaining, have been forced to find creative ways to build power in a hostile legal environment. \u201cNelson knows her history. She knows that unions and working people build power without having the law on their side and without accommodating or bowing to the interest of companies,\u201d said Rebecca Givan, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. \u201cBut clearly she believes there is value in reviving some of those strategies.\u201d \u201cThe labor movement is not something that we have to rebuild,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThe structure already exists,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that has to be put into fourth gear and supercharged.\u201d The 2020 presidential race will be a test of labor\u2019s political clout as the Democratic candidates fiercely compete for their support. There is a diversity of political views among the union ranks, as demonstrated by a debate over how best to expand health coverage. Nelson is a vocal supporter of a Medicare for All single-payer healthcare system. She argues that contract negotiations are increasingly consumed by fights over coverage and benefits, and believes that if the issue were moved \u201coff the table\u201d unions could spend more time fighting for wage increases and better working conditions. But some leaders have raised concerns that a single-payer system, championed by the progressive presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, could negatively affect the benefits they have already painstakingly negotiated. One of the loudest opponents of Medicare for All has been the International Association of Fire Fighters, which endorsed former vice-president Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination. Harold Schaitberger, the union\u2019s president, says his union\u2019s healthcare plan is designed to meet the unique and specific healthcare needs of firefighters that a Medicare plan is unlikely to provide. Sanders recently introduced a pro-labor plan that sought to assuage those worries. The proposal would effectively require employers to return any healthcare savings to workers in the form of wage increases or benefits. Still, Schaitberger worries that candidates like Sanders risk moving the Democratic party \u201ctoo far to the left\u201d and leaving workers like his members behind. \u201cI see us succeeding in many ways,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know that the success of labor can be attributed to the associated energy on what I describe as the ultra-progressive, ultra-liberal far left.\u201d Nelson has not publicly backed a 2020 candidate and her union is still designing its endorsement process. But she speaks highly of progressive stalwarts Sanders and Warren, both of whom have introduced expansive plans for growing unions and expanding worker protections. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting is that this year we actually have some real choices for labor,\u201d she said. In Atlanta, Nelson urged the audience not to wait until then to get involved. \u201cChange comes fast when the risk becomes too great for those in power,\u201d she said.",

MPs expected to stand for the post include the deputy speakers Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Eleanor Laing, Labour veterans Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier and Chris Bryant, and the Tory MP Sir Henry Bellingham. The proposed timing for Bercow\u2019s departure will be seen as a passing shot at his Brexiter critics because it could improve the chances of a remain-supporting MP succeeding him. It also ensures that he is expected to still be in post during the remaining momentous weeks in the run-up to Halloween, when Boris Johnson has promised Britain will leave the EU. In a break from normal convention whereby Speakers stand unopposed by the major parties at elections, the Conservatives had revealed on Sunday that they would challenge Bercow in his Buckingham constituency at the next national poll \u2013 whenever it is called.

The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which owns the zoo, attempted the insemination in late March but confirmed on Monday that it had failed to result in pregnancy. Charlotte Macdonald, the zoo\u2019s director of conservation and living collections, said: \u201cTian Tian was artificially inseminated at the end of March and we now know this was not successful. \u201cGiant panda breeding is an incredibly complex, unpredictable process and we will continue to share our research with our colleagues in China. It is too soon to say what any next steps will be.\u201d The zoo acquired Tian Tian and her mate, Yang Guang, in 2011 in a 10-year agreement with the Chinese government, which coincided with talks that led to a \u00a32.6bn trade deal. The RZSS pays China $1m (\u00a3810,000) a year for the pair, not including their accommodation and breeding costs, thought to be in the region of \u00a32m a year. Tian Tian had twins in 2009 and the zoo first tried to coax the pair into breeding naturally in 2012, extensively publicising the attempted coupling. This failed, however, and the zoo switched to artificial insemination using sperm from Yang Guang and then frozen samples from a male bear that has since died from Berlin zoo, which announced last week that its panda had had twins. Each attempt at artificial insemination has also resulted in failure and the RZSS has since adopted a much lower-key publicity stance. The zoo suspended its breeding programme last year a few weeks after Iain Valentine, the RZSS conservation director who had played a key role in brokering the panda deal, quit his post. It is understood he took up a consultancy with China\u2019s panda conservation centre. The zoo may choose to entirely abandon its breeding efforts. China allows zoos that successfully breed young pandas to keep the cubs for two years, but Tian Tian and Yang Guang are due to be handed back to the Chinese in 2021, unless the loan is extended.

It was with great surprise today, to learn that the mayor of Rio de Janeiro decided to ban the sale of my (and Allan Heinberg&#39;s) book, Avengers:The Children&#39;s Crusade, for alleged inappropriate material. .  For those not familiar with the work from 2010, the controversy involves a kiss between two male characters. .  Now I don&#39;t know what prompted the mayor to seek out a work that is almost a decade old, and that had already been on sale for many years, but I can say honestly, that there was no hidden motivation or agendas behind the work in promoting any particular lifestyle, nor targeting any unique audience. The scene merely depicts a tender moment between two characters who are in an established relationship. .  As an artist, my passion is to tell stories; stories of great heroism, compassion and love, with as authentic and diverse characters as possible. Characters that depict every walk of life and color, whether they be black or white, brown, yellow or green. .  The fact that this book, from almost a decade ago, is now being drawn into the spotlight by the mayor perhaps only highlights how out of touch he might be with the current times. The LGBTQ community is here to stay, and\u00a0I have nothing but love and support for those who continue to struggle for validity and a voice to be heard. .  I hope the beautiful people of Brazil, the wonderfully diverse and proud nation, will see\u00a0through this political &#39;noise&#39; and place their\u00a0focus on the light, and on ways to unite, rather than help sow the seeds of\u00a0conflict and\u00a0division .  #TeddyAltman #Hulkling #BillyKaplan #Wiccan #YoungAvengers #AvengersChildrensCrusade #MarvelComics #Marvel #Comics #MCU #pencils #pencildrawing #process #JimCheung #LoveNotHate #LGBTQ</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jimcheungart/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Jim Cheung</a> (@jimcheungart) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-09-06T19:40:06+00:00\">Sep 6, 2019 at 12:40pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://jimcheungart.bigcartel.com/\">Jim Cheung</a>, who illustrated the comic, said he was surprised to learn that a work that is almost a decade old had been sought out by the mayor for \u201calleged inappropriate material\u201d.</p> <p>The scene, he said, \u201cmerely depicts a tender moment between two characters who are in an established relationship\u201d, and the fact the book \u201cis now being drawn into the spotlight by the mayor perhaps only highlights how out of touch he might be with the current times\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope the beautiful people of Brazil, the wonderfully diverse and proud nation, will see through this political \u2018noise\u2019 and place their focus on the light, and on ways to unite, rather than help sow the seeds of conflict and division,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2FPJfen2ux/?utm_source=ig_embed\">Cheung wrote on Instagram</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAs an artist, my passion is to tell stories; stories of great heroism, compassion and love, with as authentic and diverse characters as possible.

      "bodyText": "The artist of an Avengers comic targeted by the mayor of Rio de Janeiro for featuring a gay kiss has called on the people of Brazil to focus on \u201cways to unite, rather than help sow the seeds of conflict and division\u201d. Rio de Janeiro\u2019s evangelical mayor, Marcelo Crivella, initially ordered the Brazilian book fair Bienal do Livro to wrap copies of Avengers: The Children\u2019s Crusade in black plastic, then sent city hall inspectors to the event to seize copies of the book, along with others containing LGBTQ content. The Marvel comic, which was published in 2010, includes a kiss between two male characters, Wiccan and Hulkling, who are in a committed relationship. Crivella said the move was intended to \u201cdefend the family\u201d, adding on Twitter yesterday: \u201cIt is not censorship or homophobia as many people think \u2026 We just want to protect our children, fight in defence of Brazilian families, and comply with the law.\u201d But as demonstrators marched on the event, copies of LGBTQ books at the fair sold out. YouTuber Felipe Neto also gave away thousands of copies of books with LGBTQ themes at the fair, wrapped in plastic with the warning: \u201cBook inappropriate for backward \u2026 and prejudiced people.\u201d He told the Guardian on Sunday that although Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, leads \u201cthe most frightening government in terms of repression since the dictatorship, this time we have a united and engaged people who will not permit that censorship, the imposition of others\u2019 moral values.\u201d On Sunday, Brazil\u2019s supreme court subsequently ruled that Avengers: The Children\u2019s Crusade could be sold, after a previous court decision had permitted the ban. Jim Cheung, who illustrated the comic, said he was surprised to learn that a work that is almost a decade old had been sought out by the mayor for \u201calleged inappropriate material\u201d. The scene, he said, \u201cmerely depicts a tender moment between two characters who are in an established relationship\u201d, and the fact the book \u201cis now being drawn into the spotlight by the mayor perhaps only highlights how out of touch he might be with the current times\u201d. \u201cI hope the beautiful people of Brazil, the wonderfully diverse and proud nation, will see through this political \u2018noise\u2019 and place their focus on the light, and on ways to unite, rather than help sow the seeds of conflict and division,\u201d Cheung wrote on Instagram. \u201cAs an artist, my passion is to tell stories; stories of great heroism, compassion and love, with as authentic and diverse characters as possible.

      "body": "<h2>STUNG BY HORNETS</h2> <p>If nothing else last season, Watford made a nonsense of the notion that the FA Cup is a tournament that teams such as Watford should make a decent effort to win. While other mid-ranking Premier League sides in no danger of relegation and with little else to play for fell by the wayside with barely a whimper, Hornets fans were kept buzzing as their likeable manager Javier Gracia masterminded victories over Woking, Newcastle, QPR, Crystal Palace and Wolves to set up a Wembley showdown against Manchester City. For only the second time in their history they had reached the final of the grand old competition and the denizens of a large, fairly unremarkable town in Hertfordshire dared to dream.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/07/watford-sack-head-coach-javi-gracia-after-poor-start-to-the-season\">Watford sack Javi Gracia and reappoint Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fools. While The Fiver has no wish to pick at still fresh scars by poring over the excruciating minutiae of what happened next, Watford have yet to recover from the torment and humiliation visited upon them on that fateful May afternoon. Having got just a point on the board from 12 available so far in this league campaign, poor old Javier was released from his duties over the weekend as it was felt he had lost focus and was no longer able to motivate the troops. Accordingly, the club\u2019s owners have replaced him with Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, a man previously hired to good effect by Watford until he was released from his duties as it was felt he had lost focus and was no longer able to motivate the troops.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the unexpected announcement about the termination of my contract after only four matches, I want to express my surprise after competing [in] the best season in Watford\u2019s history,\u201d said Gracia in a dignified statement possibly written on the back of the envelope in which he\u2019d received his P45. \u201cI respect this decision and I\u2019d like to reassure [fans of] the excellent relationship I have with [owners] Gino Pozzo and Filippo Giradi, and it is not going to change despite my abrupt exit of the club.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps hoping nobody among their support would notice the rotation of personnel in the technical area when they welcome Arsenal to Vicarage Road next weekend, Watford attempted to bury news of Gracia\u2019s dismissal during England\u2019s win over Bulgaria on Saturday, before announcing the reappointment of Flores later in the same game. \u201cThe club and me don\u2019t have the same point of view about the season,\u201d said Gracia soon afterwards, or was it Flores in 2016? \u201cBut I felt completely happy with this year and I have enjoyed this experience,\u201d one or the other of them continued, as a dejected Billy McKinlay hoved into view astride his moose on the club\u2019s bespoke managerial merry-go-round. \u201cI only got two matches,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they reappoint me?\u201d</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Ben Fisher for hot clockwatch coverage of the evening\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers , including Norn Iron 0-2 Germany and Scotland 0-3 Belgium, from 7.45pm BST</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cIt is extremely difficult to play against teams like the Faroe Islands, with 11 players in the area\u201d \u2013 Spain boss Roberto Moreno on why the world\u2019s 108th best team might just be international football\u2019s Pulis-era Stoke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7669a48a606898dc61d18ddbf1291b8d510f159a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7669a48a606898dc61d18ddbf1291b8d510f159a/0_30_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faroe Islands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A difficult place to go to on a rainy Tuesday night etc and so on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cRe: Ox\u2019s comments about watching England in a pub: \u2018Just seeing what they were doing and what that created around me I was like: oh my God, do I really do that?\u2019 Yes Ox, you really do \u2018do that\u2019 and that is why we are not hugely successful.

      "bodyText": "STUNG BY HORNETS If nothing else last season, Watford made a nonsense of the notion that the FA Cup is a tournament that teams such as Watford should make a decent effort to win. While other mid-ranking Premier League sides in no danger of relegation and with little else to play for fell by the wayside with barely a whimper, Hornets fans were kept buzzing as their likeable manager Javier Gracia masterminded victories over Woking, Newcastle, QPR, Crystal Palace and Wolves to set up a Wembley showdown against Manchester City. For only the second time in their history they had reached the final of the grand old competition and the denizens of a large, fairly unremarkable town in Hertfordshire dared to dream. The fools. While The Fiver has no wish to pick at still fresh scars by poring over the excruciating minutiae of what happened next, Watford have yet to recover from the torment and humiliation visited upon them on that fateful May afternoon. Having got just a point on the board from 12 available so far in this league campaign, poor old Javier was released from his duties over the weekend as it was felt he had lost focus and was no longer able to motivate the troops. Accordingly, the club\u2019s owners have replaced him with Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, a man previously hired to good effect by Watford until he was released from his duties as it was felt he had lost focus and was no longer able to motivate the troops. \u201cAfter the unexpected announcement about the termination of my contract after only four matches, I want to express my surprise after competing [in] the best season in Watford\u2019s history,\u201d said Gracia in a dignified statement possibly written on the back of the envelope in which he\u2019d received his P45. \u201cI respect this decision and I\u2019d like to reassure [fans of] the excellent relationship I have with [owners] Gino Pozzo and Filippo Giradi, and it is not going to change despite my abrupt exit of the club.\u201d Perhaps hoping nobody among their support would notice the rotation of personnel in the technical area when they welcome Arsenal to Vicarage Road next weekend, Watford attempted to bury news of Gracia\u2019s dismissal during England\u2019s win over Bulgaria on Saturday, before announcing the reappointment of Flores later in the same game. \u201cThe club and me don\u2019t have the same point of view about the season,\u201d said Gracia soon afterwards, or was it Flores in 2016? \u201cBut I felt completely happy with this year and I have enjoyed this experience,\u201d one or the other of them continued, as a dejected Billy McKinlay hoved into view astride his moose on the club\u2019s bespoke managerial merry-go-round. \u201cI only got two matches,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they reappoint me?\u201d LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Ben Fisher for hot clockwatch coverage of the evening\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers , including Norn Iron 0-2 Germany and Scotland 0-3 Belgium, from 7.45pm BST. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt is extremely difficult to play against teams like the Faroe Islands, with 11 players in the area\u201d \u2013 Spain boss Roberto Moreno on why the world\u2019s 108th best team might just be international football\u2019s Pulis-era Stoke.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS David de Gea is this close to writing David de Gea on a new contract at Manchester United. Former England Women manager Mark Sampson has been handed the caretaker\u2019s broom handle at Stevenage \u201cuntil further notice\u201d after the League Two side flung Dino Maamria through the door marked Do One. England boss Gareth Southgate has asked Marcus Rashford to use his speed more effectively and \u201cto spend less time dropping back\u201d, which sounds like the Berbatov approach to football. Diego Maradona put his creaking knees at risk of collapse as he sang \u201cThe one who doesn\u2019t jump is English\u201d as he was unveiled as Gimnasia manager at an open training session. Bolton defender Joe Bunney broke ribs and a collarbone in a road accident at the weekend, the club have confirmed. Bunney joined the Trotters last Monday.

First, Bowen\u2019s prose can be incomparable, beginning on the first page with a breathtaking evocation of London in January. Second, there is the psychological acuity.

The book is more in the realm of pure fantasy than \u201cMagic Realism\u201d, though historical figures are mentioned, including Vlad the Impaler, who is one of the pack of warlords, sultans and dictators who are engaged in bloody territorial disputes in the narrative. I highly recommend it for fans of escapism.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16060838\">Tom Mooney </a>recommends Dreaming of Babylon by Richard Brautigan:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now THAT is how you write a detective parody. Brautigan somehow manages to deliver a gripping (if slightly bizarre) private eye novel while simultaneously satirising the entire genre. It\u2019s just great. I\u2019m starting to run out of his books now ... A sad day is approaching!</p> </blockquote> <p>Alas!

SydneyH has a \u201cnew favourite\u201d Salman Rushdie novel \u2013 The Enchantress Of Florence: It might not seem like an obvious choice, but it has a few things quite noticeably in its favour: firstly, it is set in the distant past, so we are spared any zany pop culture references; secondly, it isn\u2019t blatantly modelled on an existing text, though it echoes One Thousand and One Nights; and it is the only Rushdie novel I\u2019ve encountered with an invisible narrator, as opposed to some of the others, in which it feels like the author is Morris dancing provocatively just out of reach. The book is more in the realm of pure fantasy than \u201cMagic Realism\u201d, though historical figures are mentioned, including Vlad the Impaler, who is one of the pack of warlords, sultans and dictators who are engaged in bloody territorial disputes in the narrative. I highly recommend it for fans of escapism. Finally, Tom Mooney recommends Dreaming of Babylon by Richard Brautigan: Now THAT is how you write a detective parody. Brautigan somehow manages to deliver a gripping (if slightly bizarre) private eye novel while simultaneously satirising the entire genre. It\u2019s just great. I\u2019m starting to run out of his books now ... A sad day is approaching! Alas! Although, there\u2019s always the joy of re-reading\u2026 Interesting links about books and reading The 50 best one-star Amazon reviews of Goodnight Moon. \u201cIf you believe that Amazon sent out 800 (or more) copies accidentally, I\u2019ve got some swamp land in Florida I\u2019d like to sell you.\u201d MobyLives weighs in on those escaped copies of Margaret Atwood\u2019s new novel. \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room was Baldwin\u2019s bastard child in the way he was a bastard child.\u201d Hilton Als on James Baldwin\u2019s extraordinary novel.

One of the fundamental principles of the rule of law is that it applies to everyone, including prime ministers. This law has been passed by parliament. Those who defy the law become accountable.

That means parliament trumps the prime minister. The EU is required to take account of the UK\u2019s constitutional framework. In deciding whether to give an extension, the EU will be guided by an act of parliament and not the prime minister. If the prime minister chooses to undermine parliament, the courts will step in and if need be hold the prime minister in contempt.\u201d</p> <p>Susan D Shaw, managing partner at Living Law, based in Scotland, said recent events should be \u201cringing the alarm bells across the country for every citizen\u201d, regardless of their views on Brexit. \u201cThe rule of law is being seriously eroded with each and every day that now passes and with it all of our hard-won rights as citizens. History shows us where this dangerous path leads.\u201d</p> <p>She added that Johnson\u2019s actions had \u201ctainted the history and stature of our world-leading institutions and are diminishing our standing in the global order. On any rational view he is simply unfit to hold high office.\u201d</p> <p>Shoaib M Khan, a human rights lawyer at SMK Law Solicitors, said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s plan to somehow seek an extension yet not seek an extension is senseless, an affront to the rule of law and almost certainly unlawful. It would bring parliament, and indeed the country, into disrepute.\u201d</p> <p>Khan pointed to the recent announcement that the civil rights group Liberty has launched a judicial review case seeking to compel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Johnson</a> to comply with a bill. \u201cThe PM should immediately announce he will properly comply with the wording and spirit of the legislation, and refrain from further irresponsible attempts to play games with the future of this country,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court justice, said it would not be legal for the prime minister to ask for an extension while rubbishing the request at the same time.</p> <p>Lord Sumption told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe bill, or the act as it is about to become, says that he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. Not only has he got to send the letter, he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. And to send the letter and then try and neutralise it seems to me to be plainly a breach of the act.\u201d</p> <p>Sumption said he had read the bill and there was not \u201cthe slightest obscurity\u201d about what the government was obliged to do. He said: \u201cYou have got to realise that the courts are not very fond of loopholes. They are going to interpret this act in a way that gives effect to its obvious purpose unless there\u2019s something in the act that makes it completely impossible to do so and there isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Sumption said Johnson would not only be in contempt of court if he failed to do what the bill stated, but would risk the resignation of the justice secretary, the attorney general, and other members of his cabinet.</p> <p>He added there were \u201cplenty of ways\u201d in which this kind of obligation could be enforced. \u201cAn application will have to be made to the court for an injunction. The simplest way of enforcing the injunction would be for the court simply to direct an official to sign the letter on behalf of the PM and to declare that his signature was to be treated in every legal respect as equivalent to the prime minister\u2019s,\u201d he explained.</p>",

Jonathan Cooper, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said unless Brexiters could find a way to challenge the act preventing no deal, the government had to comply. \u201cThere is only one building block to the UK system of government and that\u2019s the sovereignty of parliament. That means parliament trumps the prime minister. The EU is required to take account of the UK\u2019s constitutional framework. In deciding whether to give an extension, the EU will be guided by an act of parliament and not the prime minister. If the prime minister chooses to undermine parliament, the courts will step in and if need be hold the prime minister in contempt.\u201d Susan D Shaw, managing partner at Living Law, based in Scotland, said recent events should be \u201cringing the alarm bells across the country for every citizen\u201d, regardless of their views on Brexit. \u201cThe rule of law is being seriously eroded with each and every day that now passes and with it all of our hard-won rights as citizens. History shows us where this dangerous path leads.\u201d She added that Johnson\u2019s actions had \u201ctainted the history and stature of our world-leading institutions and are diminishing our standing in the global order. On any rational view he is simply unfit to hold high office.\u201d Shoaib M Khan, a human rights lawyer at SMK Law Solicitors, said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s plan to somehow seek an extension yet not seek an extension is senseless, an affront to the rule of law and almost certainly unlawful. It would bring parliament, and indeed the country, into disrepute.\u201d Khan pointed to the recent announcement that the civil rights group Liberty has launched a judicial review case seeking to compel Johnson to comply with a bill. \u201cThe PM should immediately announce he will properly comply with the wording and spirit of the legislation, and refrain from further irresponsible attempts to play games with the future of this country,\u201d he said. Earlier on Monday, Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court justice, said it would not be legal for the prime minister to ask for an extension while rubbishing the request at the same time. Lord Sumption told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe bill, or the act as it is about to become, says that he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. Not only has he got to send the letter, he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. And to send the letter and then try and neutralise it seems to me to be plainly a breach of the act.\u201d Sumption said he had read the bill and there was not \u201cthe slightest obscurity\u201d about what the government was obliged to do. He said: \u201cYou have got to realise that the courts are not very fond of loopholes. They are going to interpret this act in a way that gives effect to its obvious purpose unless there\u2019s something in the act that makes it completely impossible to do so and there isn\u2019t.\u201d Sumption said Johnson would not only be in contempt of court if he failed to do what the bill stated, but would risk the resignation of the justice secretary, the attorney general, and other members of his cabinet. He added there were \u201cplenty of ways\u201d in which this kind of obligation could be enforced. \u201cAn application will have to be made to the court for an injunction. The simplest way of enforcing the injunction would be for the court simply to direct an official to sign the letter on behalf of the PM and to declare that his signature was to be treated in every legal respect as equivalent to the prime minister\u2019s,\u201d he explained.",

      "body": "<p>They say love is a numbers game. Bobby Seagull \u2013 the mathematician who rose to fame as a finalist on University Challenge in 2017 \u2013 took them literally.</p> <p>A few years ago, he sat down to try to work out why he had been so unlucky in life. \u201cI was 32 or 33, I was single, I loved maths and science \u2013 I thought: \u2018Can I use maths and science to help me?\u2019 It was a genuine, earnest attempt.\u201d</p> <p>Inspired by Peter Backus \u2013 a Manchester University economics lecturer who in 2010 wrote a paper titled Why I Don\u2019t Have a Girlfriend \u2013 Seagull used the Drake equation, developed to estimate how <a href=\"https://seti.org/drake-equation-index\" title=\"\">many intelligent alien civilisations there might be</a> in the galaxy, to determine his number of potential partners. \u201cYou start by assuming there\u2019s infinitely many, then you keep on making the pool smaller and smaller.\u201d</p> <p>From the total female populations of London and Cambridge \u2013 the cities between which he split his time \u2013 Seagull selected those roughly his age and up to 10 years younger. Then he reduced that group to the proportion that were likely to be university educated, to reflect the reality of his networks, as a school maths teacher and doctorate student.</p> <p>Then came a harder parameter: what fraction Seagull might find attractive. After going through his Facebook friends list, he found 1,200 women who met his criteria for age, location and education \u2013 and of one in every 20, he says he thought that he \u201ccould imagine us, in another life\u201d.</p> <p>That left Seagull with 29,369 potential girlfriends: as he puts it, a decent-sized crowd at the old West Ham ground at Upton Park. But that did not account for two important factors: his next girlfriend would have to be single \u2013 and she would have to find him attractive, too.</p> <p>Seagull found himself with a final total of 73. Whether that figure floods you with optimism or despair may mark you out as a romantic or a realist. On one hand, it\u2019s nowhere close to filling up a football stadium. On the other, it is significantly greater than one. As in, the One.</p> <p>Numbers have long factored into the dating game, even for those who have a ropey grasp on them. We might wonder, of a couple\u2019s particularly serendipitous origin story: \u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d Or we might console someone who is unhappily single that \u201cit only takes one\u201d.</p> <p>Online dating has strengthened mathematics\u2019 role in the search for love, not only in serving up seemingly infinite potential partners, but in using algorithms to sift through them. As it is increasingly accepted that there is no perfect one for each of us, the numbers are on our side \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean the search is easy.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are many \u2018ones\u2019,\u201d says Seagull. \u201cThere are 107 billion people who have ever existed \u2013 if you really think there is one person who is truly your \u2018one\u2019, they\u2019ve probably died.\u201d</p> <p>Now 35 and still single, Seagull has continued his investigation into \u201cmaking the maths of love work for you\u201d in his book, The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers, as well as on dates. When he had reached that 73 figure, he says, he showed his working to his mum as a somewhat tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to her persistent inquiries as to why he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is, that\u2019s on paper \u2013 it doesn\u2019t tell you whether you\u2019re compatible in person. On paper, I\u2019m probably a perfect match with my dad, if he was a woman, and not related to me.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s 73 people that I think would be a perfect fit for me \u2013 I may not be a perfect fit for them.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps understandably, on being confronted by a pool of potential partners who could fit comfortably on one double-decker bus, Seagull says he has learned the need to relax his criteria. After all, he says, the mathematician Hannah Fry found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/feb/01/looking-love-wrong-equations-mathematics-sexual-partners\" title=\"\">the most successful couples have a \u201clow negativity threshold\u201d</a>, meaning they argue often but easily move on. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got to start thinking: what\u2019s the most efficient way of dating people so that you can quickly establish their potential?\u201d</p> <p>Seagull supports a \u201clittle bit of stress-testing\u201d even at the dating stage; his suggestion is to bring up Brexit, less to weed out leave or remain voters than to test a potential partner\u2019s capacity for disagreement. (Excluding leave voters would further reduce his pool from 73 to about 40, he says, sounding dismayed.)</p> <p>Like the Drake equation, online dating can present you only with a pool of suitable partners you could potentially meet. Attraction must be assessed in person, \u201cand there is no formula for that\u201d, says Seagull. Or at least not yet, he adds; he is confident that machine-learning technology will eventually be able \u201cto read your mood, your mind \u2026 and detect bits of our personality\u201d to predict the presence of that elusive spark.</p> <p>In decades to come, it may even be possible to simulate dates the same way that it is football matches now, modelling every variable \u2013 although, Seagull says, probably not soon enough to be of any use to him.</p> <p>For now, the most efficient approach to dating is to meet as many potential partners as possible \u2013 and apps connect us with a seemingly infinite number. There can often be an element of the paradox of choice: sure, this match seems good, but what if an even better one is a swipe away?</p> <p>This is where <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/18/hannah-fry-the-mathematics-of-love/\" title=\"\">optimal-stopping theory</a> can come into play, identifying the point in a process at which to stop for best results \u2013 and here the magic number, says Seagull, is 37%. Say he wanted to be in a relationship by the age of 40, and was prepared to commit to going on two dates a week, for 50 weeks of the year, for five years: 500 dates total. Optimal-stopping theory would have Seagull go on 185 dates \u2013 taking him the best part of two years \u2013 then, armed with the insights he gained along the way, pursue the woman he liked best from the 186th on.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know at what stage in these 500 dates you will meet your most suited person, and you\u2019re probably going to miss them \u2013 but mathematically, this is how you can settle better.</p> <p>\u201cThis is where you really need to trust the maths \u2013 you might think that the first person you meet is amazing, but you\u2019ve got to get through the first 185. If we simulated our lives a million times, the person that you would date best would still be after 185.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping track of that number would inevitably necessitate a spreadsheet, or at least note-taking, which even Seagull sees as a step too far: \u201cI haven\u2019t got that cynical yet.\u201d</p> <p>The key to bear in mind, he says, is that \u201conce you\u2019ve got your potential pool, you need to maximise your chances by meeting as many of them as quickly as possible\u201d \u2013 before they get coupled up, leave the country or otherwise remove themselves.</p> <p>There is evidence to support coming to a conclusion about potential partners quickly \u2013 even if by gut feeling alone.

      "bodyText": "They say love is a numbers game. Bobby Seagull \u2013 the mathematician who rose to fame as a finalist on University Challenge in 2017 \u2013 took them literally. A few years ago, he sat down to try to work out why he had been so unlucky in life. \u201cI was 32 or 33, I was single, I loved maths and science \u2013 I thought: \u2018Can I use maths and science to help me?\u2019 It was a genuine, earnest attempt.\u201d Inspired by Peter Backus \u2013 a Manchester University economics lecturer who in 2010 wrote a paper titled Why I Don\u2019t Have a Girlfriend \u2013 Seagull used the Drake equation, developed to estimate how many intelligent alien civilisations there might be in the galaxy, to determine his number of potential partners. \u201cYou start by assuming there\u2019s infinitely many, then you keep on making the pool smaller and smaller.\u201d From the total female populations of London and Cambridge \u2013 the cities between which he split his time \u2013 Seagull selected those roughly his age and up to 10 years younger. Then he reduced that group to the proportion that were likely to be university educated, to reflect the reality of his networks, as a school maths teacher and doctorate student. Then came a harder parameter: what fraction Seagull might find attractive. After going through his Facebook friends list, he found 1,200 women who met his criteria for age, location and education \u2013 and of one in every 20, he says he thought that he \u201ccould imagine us, in another life\u201d. That left Seagull with 29,369 potential girlfriends: as he puts it, a decent-sized crowd at the old West Ham ground at Upton Park. But that did not account for two important factors: his next girlfriend would have to be single \u2013 and she would have to find him attractive, too. Seagull found himself with a final total of 73. Whether that figure floods you with optimism or despair may mark you out as a romantic or a realist. On one hand, it\u2019s nowhere close to filling up a football stadium. On the other, it is significantly greater than one. As in, the One. Numbers have long factored into the dating game, even for those who have a ropey grasp on them. We might wonder, of a couple\u2019s particularly serendipitous origin story: \u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d Or we might console someone who is unhappily single that \u201cit only takes one\u201d. Online dating has strengthened mathematics\u2019 role in the search for love, not only in serving up seemingly infinite potential partners, but in using algorithms to sift through them. As it is increasingly accepted that there is no perfect one for each of us, the numbers are on our side \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean the search is easy. \u201cI think there are many \u2018ones\u2019,\u201d says Seagull. \u201cThere are 107 billion people who have ever existed \u2013 if you really think there is one person who is truly your \u2018one\u2019, they\u2019ve probably died.\u201d Now 35 and still single, Seagull has continued his investigation into \u201cmaking the maths of love work for you\u201d in his book, The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers, as well as on dates.

At a moment when there is mounting worry surrounding certain European cities being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/25/prague-drunk-tourists-conquer-our-city\" title=\"\">overrun with tourists</a>, it seems myopic to stage matches in three of the continent\u2019s most rammed sightseeing locations: Amsterdam, Budapest and Rome.</p> <p>Admittedly there should be few such problems in slightly more off-the-beaten-track Bucharest, while things should really shift a full 180 degrees in Baku. With costs high and obtaining visas a bit of a rigmarole, tourists are few and far between.

Of the eight grounds, the closest are three miles apart but integrated walking trails, cycle paths and a light railway join the dots, enabling fans to watch two games a day.</p> <p>Considering the stadiums are modular \u2013 assembled from easy-to-deconstruct shipping containers, ready for partial or entire dismantling, donation, export and rebuilding in impoverished countries \u2013 it all appears a sustainability nirvana.</p> <p>The irony is that there is also an awful lot not to like about Qatar \u2013 its well-documented role in the rise of Islamic extremist-fuelled terrorism, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/21/qatar-2022-40-a-week-to-build-the-world-cup-stadiums\" title=\"\">treatment of expatriate labourers</a> responsible for building the tournament infrastructure and a less than pristine human rights record.</p> <p>Purely in environmental terms, the blueprint of the first such showpiece staged in the Middle East not only looks miles ahead of the curve but a decent template for major 21st-century high-density sporting events.</p> <p>Caveats abound. Regardless of that sensitive, water-muddying, geopolitical backdrop, a month beneath Doha\u2019s gentle winter sun may prove claustrophobically dull for some.

      "bodyText": "Imagine a series of outline maps spanning England, Europe and, perhaps even, the world. They feature clearly highlighted contours and country boundaries but the neatly printed place names that customarily adorn atlases and globes are missing. It is safe to assume that, asked to fill in the blanks and pinpoint specific towns and cities, a lot of people might make some embarrassingly bad guesses. But what price football fans proving the geographically literate exceptions? Think about it; everyone who regularly follows an English league team on the road, knows which respective sides of the Pennines Bradford and Bolton belong to and would be mortified to get Wolverhampton muddled up with West Bromwich. If their club plays in Europe, or they are aficionados of the international game, those supporters are similarly unlikely to suffer a brain freeze when it comes to separating Budapest from Bucharest. That duo will be in the news next summer when Hungary and Romania are two of the 12 countries hosting 24 teams and 51 matches at a strangely atomised Euro 2020. It is part of the tournament\u2019s 60th birthday celebrations but the move away from one nation \u2013 or two at most \u2013 signals the sort of unfortunate timing that suggests football is, once again, behind the curve. All those contrails constantly crisscrossing an area stretching from Baku to Bilbao en route to the eventual denouement in London will surely seem indicative of a sport apparently too arrogantly self-important to bother itself about the climate emergency. Carbon-related concerns aside, common sense appears in short supply. At a moment when there is mounting worry surrounding certain European cities being overrun with tourists, it seems myopic to stage matches in three of the continent\u2019s most rammed sightseeing locations: Amsterdam, Budapest and Rome. Admittedly there should be few such problems in slightly more off-the-beaten-track Bucharest, while things should really shift a full 180 degrees in Baku. With costs high and obtaining visas a bit of a rigmarole, tourists are few and far between. So rare, indeed, that it is surprisingly difficult to buy a commemorative postcard, let alone a T-shirt, in an Azerbaijani capital geared much more towards catering for the corporate types typically found pacing Uefa\u2019s corridors of power. Were Greta Thunberg ever to face down those decision\u2011making suits, her pigtails would surely flap with righteous indignation at the giant carbon footprint symbolised by the telltale white vapour streams stretching behind zigzagging aircraft carrying teams, supporters and media between assorted Euro 2020 venues. For the moment at least, though, football\u2019s all\u2011consuming appeal ensures that fans who might breezily condemn members of the royal family \u2013 think Harry and Meghan \u2013 for jaunting off to the Mediterranean on private aircraft, happily turn a blind eye to the game\u2019s collective executive jet habit. As any plane spotter worth their salt knows, Arsenal\u2019s infamous 14-minute charter flight from Luton to Norwich in 2015 merely represents the tip of the, er, iceberg. By 2026 \u2013 when a World Cup staged in Canada, the United States and Mexico will embrace countries comprising about 14% of the planet\u2019s landmass \u2013 such hypocrisies may be less acceptable. Even the most ardent football evangelist might feel that spreading the game\u2019s gospel from Montreal to Mexico City is no longer the modern equivalent of missionary work but simply way out of synch with the prevailing zeitgeist. A watershed beckons in 2022, when Qatar boasts of hosting the first carbon-neutral World Cup, all within a 31-mile radius of Doha. Of the eight grounds, the closest are three miles apart but integrated walking trails, cycle paths and a light railway join the dots, enabling fans to watch two games a day. Considering the stadiums are modular \u2013 assembled from easy-to-deconstruct shipping containers, ready for partial or entire dismantling, donation, export and rebuilding in impoverished countries \u2013 it all appears a sustainability nirvana. The irony is that there is also an awful lot not to like about Qatar \u2013 its well-documented role in the rise of Islamic extremist-fuelled terrorism, its treatment of expatriate labourers responsible for building the tournament infrastructure and a less than pristine human rights record. Purely in environmental terms, the blueprint of the first such showpiece staged in the Middle East not only looks miles ahead of the curve but a decent template for major 21st-century high-density sporting events. Caveats abound. Regardless of that sensitive, water-muddying, geopolitical backdrop, a month beneath Doha\u2019s gentle winter sun may prove claustrophobically dull for some. Generally, though, an opportunity to get a proper feel for an entirely new culture and landscape is infinitely more rewarding than constantly shuttling between anonymous airport departure lounges and \u2013 increasingly \u2013 out-of-town stadiums. Rather than failing to even peek beneath the surface of fleetingly visited host cities, staying awhile invariably represents the difference between recalling a place as just another generic \u201canywheresville\u201d and somewhere invested with meaning and memories. Travel, domestic and overseas, remains one of football fandom\u2019s great joys while the anoraks among us will always delight at filling in the blanks on outline maps. After covering England\u2019s Lionesses\u2019 past three major tournament adventures, this writer\u2019s party tricks include an ability to locate Canada\u2019s Moncton, the Netherlands\u2019 Deventer and France\u2019s River Var. If future generations are to be able to invest their own mental atlases with treasured recollections, significant tweaks to current thinking will be demanded \u2013 starting with a consensus that the environmentally damaging extravagance of Euro 2020 cannot be repeated.",

      "bodyText": "Over a period of 15 years, from 1967 to 1982, Peter Nichols, who has died aged 92, wrote some of the most brilliant and distinctive plays on the British stage. Yet he became sour and paranoid about the failure of the artistic establishment to pay him his rightful due. He remained best known for his early success A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1967), in which a married couple cope with their difficulties caring for a child with severe disabilities through comedy routines and black humour. It was an absolute first in breaking that sort of polite taboo about people with disabilities, and it caused a furore. But the play \u2013 which sprang from Nichols\u2019s own family experience, like all of his work; his first child, Abigail, spent most of her 11 years of life in hospital \u2013 won Nichols the first of his four Evening Standard drama awards. A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, in a still censored theatre, tested the limits of comedy and even managed to circumvent the suggestion made by the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s office that the child might be represented on stage by a dummy. The moment when little Joe skips out of the chair in a vision of what might have been in her life is one of the most original and heartbreaking in all modern drama. In later years, Nichols never stopped writing, and never stopped complaining; no one, he felt, wanted to present his work in the West End or at the National Theatre, for which he had had two plays produced, with differing degrees of success, in 1969 and 1974. The unresolved question was: had he stopped writing well, or had he simply gone out of fashion? Judging by the limited evidence of the odd sightings since he officially \u201cretired\u201d from the theatre in 1982, after yet another bust-up over the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s production of his Opium Wars musical, Poppy, the answer was: probably both. Nichols himself, who was formed as a writer by the second world war (and his national service in the far east, which he called his \u201cuniversity\u201d), his love of the music hall and sense of displacement as a provincial, was ferociously hard on himself, and on others. His friend and fellow playwright Michael Frayn admired above all his dangerousness: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any of the techniques of self-censorship that other writers develop. Sometimes he says terrible things that no one else would say, that absolutely strike home to one\u2019s heart, and sometimes he says things which are embarrassing.\u201d This frankness carried through to his writing style, which broke down the \u201cfourth wall\u201d in directly addressing the audience, and sarcastically memorialising the past in present-tense use of parlour songs, vaudeville routines, brutal jokes and an acid rain of envy, regret, nostalgia and sudden shafts of tenderness. In an aberrant return to the theatre in 1987, with the suitably titled A Piece of My Mind, he even came clean on his envious dislike of Tom Stoppard, creating a successful playwright, Miles Whittier, who made over one of the main character\u2019s lesser plays into something resembling a success; Whittier scored yet another critical bull\u2019s-eye with an intellectual comedy on a cruise-ship bound for Turkey (on board passengers included Gandhi, Kipling, Chekhov and Dame Nellie Melba) nicknamed \u201cLook Back in Ankara\u201d. But Whittier became a dumping ground for other grudges, too, namely all dramatists still writing, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the RSC. Nichols was convinced that he had seen the best of his time between the coming of John Osborne, who became his close friend, and about 1970; and that the abolition of censorship in 1968 coincided with a chronic decline in the popular interest in live theatre, by which, of course, he meant his type of live theatre. Born in Bristol, Peter was the son of a Richard Nichols, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Violet (nee Poole), and went to Bristol grammar school. He had an uncle who was a theatrical agent, and took him on theatre visits from an early age. When posted to India and Malaysia on national service with the RAF in 1945, he joined the Combined Services Entertainment unit, where his colleagues in revues and sketches included Kenneth Williams and Stanley Baxter. That experience would be the background to his hugely successful first play for the RSC in 1977, Privates on Parade, in which the autobiographical character of Steven Flowers (played by Ian Gelder, and, in 2001 in a Donmar Warehouse revival, by James McAvoy) is inducted in matters of sex, authority and vaudeville. Returning to Bristol at the end of his own time in the CSE, Nichols joined the Bristol Old Vic theatre school, trained as an actor, and continued writing sketches and plays.

The Dave Clark film gave Boorman a Hollywood calling card and Nichols time to write his first stage play, A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, which was rejected by every management in London. Finally, Michael Blakemore directed the play at the Glasgow Citizens, the critics raved and Albert Finney\u2019s Memorial Enterprises presented the show in London, and then New York, where Finney himself starred in a three-month packed-out run. Blakemore famously directed the next two superb Nichols plays \u2013 The National Health at the Old Vic for the National Theatre (1969), a dance of death and a television soap parody at once, set in an NHS cancer ward; and Forget-Me-Not Lane at Greenwich theatre (1971), Nichols\u2019s own favourite play, a family vaudeville with songs that was, said Nichols, \u201cminimalist before minimalism was invented\u201d \u2013 before the inevitable falling out.

The 1971 film of Joe Egg, starring Alan Bates and Janet Suzman, Nichols rated \u201can arty horror film that just wasn\u2019t funny\u201d, but Jack Gold\u2019s movie of The National Health (1973) still packs a punch in a mood of heightened black comedy. He followed Privates on Parade with another favourite play, Born in the Gardens (1979), in which Beryl Reid gloriously played a dotty old widow holed up in Bristol with one of her children, an antiquarian pornographer, and visited by the other two, one a Labour MP, the other a walking sun-tan advert for Florida. Like Forget-Me-Not Lane, it is a flawlessly structured piece of writing and a high point in Nichols\u2019 creative life as a domestic archaeologist. Mike Ockrent directed the next RSC commission, Passion Play (1980), in which adultery is laid bare in a marriage where the partners have onstage alter egos, and the sense of blasphemy, betrayal and self-disgust is pumped up with great blasts of ecclesiastical music; a Donmar Warehouse revival in 2000, directed by Michael Grandage, confirmed this play as a modern classic, and a further West End production opened at the Duke of York\u2019s in 2013.

      "bodyText": "Kit Carson revelled in his image as a star-maker with the power to help promising junior footballers realise their dreams of making it in the professional game. He relished the glowing testimonials that his former players \u2013 among them household names \u2013 provided for his website and writings and he was never short of invitations to matches and glitzy football dinners. But there was a darkness to Carson that only fully emerged after the Guardian broke the football abuse scandal in 2016. Dozens of former players, among them ex-internationals, contacted the police and the children\u2019s charity the NSPCC to say they had been sexually abused by Carson. Carson\u2019s death in a road crash just before the prosecution case against him was due to start at Peterborough crown court in January deprived survivors of the chance to give evidence against him. His inquest gives a few answers but questions remain, not least how a man like Carson was able to work in the professional game for more than 20 years and why even after complaints were made about him he continued to be involved in the sport right up until his arrest. Michael Sean Carson, to give him his full name, was a proud Irishman but lived his whole life in England. He gained his first football coaching badges while he studied economics at the University of Hull. After a brief teaching career in Bedford he set up a football school, which he claimed was the first in England. He was successful and his potential was spotted in 1983 by Norwich City, then a First Division side. At Norwich he brought through players who went on to win international honours including Craig Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Danny Mills. After 10 years he moved to Peterborough United, spending eight years there and working with the likes of Matthew Etherington and Simon Davies, both of whom went on to Premier League careers with Tottenham Hotspur. None of theses were complainants in the case against him. Carson\u2019s reputation was such that in 2005 the Premier League champions Chelsea, then managed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, appointed him as a scout co-ordinator for the East Anglia region. Many of his players have gone on to become respected coaches in their own right, including Dan Ashworth, who was not one of the complainants, who until recently was the FA\u2019s technical director. Those who played for or worked with Carson paint a picture of an innovative coach. In a time before sports science was such an integral part of the game, Carson insisted that his young players ate properly and put a great emphasis on mental as well as physical strength. He was one of the first to give media training to his players. He also looked towards Europe before many others, taking schoolboy players on hundreds of trips to Scandinavia, eastern and southern Europe to take part in tournaments that broadened their experience and resolve. One of Carson\u2019s Norwich players who went on to make it as a professional and still works in the game said: \u201cFootball life with Kit was an exciting adventure. Kit had ideas which were new in England and often ridiculed by the senior staff. We were taught about the importance of a strong mental attitude, nutrition and how to prepare for training and matches.\u201d On his website Carson claimed: \u201cI probably know more about European grassroots soccer than almost any other youth developer in England.\u201d It was boastful but a case could be made. Away from football, Carson seemed a respectable family man. He was married to Pauline and was a proud father and grandfather. At the time of his death he and his wife lived quietly in a riverside flat in Cambridge. But Carson was hiding a secret. Former players have told the Guardian that as adolescents they were ordered to strip naked so that Carson could check how they were developing. Some were forced to exercise, do weights or swim naked as he watched. Others have described being ordered to wrestle in muddy puddles in just their underwear both in the UK and during those trips abroad. They were also forced to massage each other with oil as Carson looked on. So routine were these practices that most of the children simply obeyed without questioning. Besides, they knew Carson was the gateway to a career in football and if they resisted they faced the boot. One player told Carson to \u201cfuck off\u201d when the coach asked him to strip. He says he never played for a Carson team again. The trips abroad were a perfect way for Carson to cement his relationships with boys, far from home and family. Carson was emboldened to go further with some of the boys. His death means that the claims against him will not be tested before a jury but he was facing 12 counts of indecent assault and one of causing a child to engage in sexual activity. The allegations concerned 11 boys. According to the particulars of the offences, the first alleged indecent assault happened at a hotel in the north of England in the late 1970s or early 80s. The incitement offence allegedly happened as recently as February 2009 in Cambridge. This is said to have involved Carson showing the complainant images of scantily clad women while he exercised. However, the bulk of the incidents took place in and around Peterborough, where Carson was academy director between 1993 and 2001. At Peterborough, Carson worked with another now notorious figure in football \u2013 Bob Higgins, the former Southampton junior coach who in June was jailed for 24 years for abusing schoolboys over a 25-year period. Higgins arrived at Peterborough in the mid-90s as the under-16s coach, having parted company with Southampton after six boys came forward to claim they had been sexually abused by him. The police have played down the idea that Carson and Higgins abused boys together or were part of a wider paedophile network but at least one former Peterborough player \u2013 Dion Raitt \u2013 has said he was sexually targeted by both men and believes they colluded. Raitt, who has waived his right to anonymity, has said he was groomed and abused by Higgins over many months. His contact with Carson was fleeting but disturbing. He remembers being called to Carson\u2019s office at Peterborough United\u2019s ground and made to stand naked in front of him as his future was discussed. \u201cIt was as though there had been some sort of highlight put against my name,\u201d Raitt told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel. Either it was: \u2018He really wants it,\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s really vulnerable.\u2019\u201d There appear to be similarities in the ways the men operated, from persuading their charges to regard them as father figures to using massage to normalise physical contact. Both also encouraged the boys to write to them. Higgins kept messages from his former players in which they professed love for him in his attic. Carson published scores of testimonials from his players on his website and in a book he wrote about some of the players he worked with at Peterborough. The book, which includes photos of boys posing topless during trips abroad and one image of two players sleeping shirtless in twin beds, makes uncomfortable reading. Higgins left Peterborough under a cloud with the club blaming his beliefs: he claimed to be a faith healer and \u201cbaptised\u201d some boys in his bath. Carson tried to cover for his colleague by claiming the commute from Southampton was too much for him and saying Higgins would continue to scout for Peterborough. One of the many disturbing things about the Higgins case was that he was still working in the sport \u2013 albeit not directly with children \u2013 when the Guardian broke the football abuse scandal.

The reality is that Britain and the US are in an arms race with the Russians in this theatre \u2013 with no remotely peaceful objective.</p> <p>Military interventionism remains an obsession of the western powers: Donald Trump, to his credit, has shown some reticence in intervening \u2013 and yet he likes to threaten military action around the world and US forces continue to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-drops-the-mother-of-all-bombs-on-afghanistan\" title=\"\">drop bombs</a> on foreign countries. Actions by western powers are based on a belief in their moral superiority and also in their right to impose that superiority on others through force rather than example. In the days of empire, such imposition at least had the quality of effectiveness. Today it has not. The devastation of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are only the most prominent examples of intervention failure.</p> <p>Britain no longer has the capacity to impose peace or democracy on the world. What it does have is the opportunity to set an example in its own democratic behaviour \u2013 not exactly a shining one at present. Its foreign policy should not be to aid war \u2013 to add fuel to the flames of violence round the world is inexcusable. The arms fair starting in London tomorrow should never be repeated.

As anyone who has visited this show in the past knows, it is the most awesome glamorisation of death on the planet. The claim that the British government sells only for internal security ranks high in Whitehall\u2019s mendacity register. Few of the 35,000 delegates from 68 countries at the \u201cfair\u201d are in the democracy promotion business: witness the attempted sale (now stopped) of prison shackles and electric-shock weapons. Big, high-priced sellers are bombers, drones and vanity warships. Britain should not be weaponising the suppression of dissent in Egypt, Bangladesh, Colombia, Uzbekistan or Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. For them, national defence might be better termed, regime defence. The government boasted of record sales of \u00a314bn last year, with 80% going to the Middle East. The tragedy being inflicted on Yemen by Saudi Arabia, major recipient of British weaponry, led to the court of appeal ruling in June that arms sales to the Saudis are illegal. The reality is that Britain and the US are in an arms race with the Russians in this theatre \u2013 with no remotely peaceful objective. Military interventionism remains an obsession of the western powers: Donald Trump, to his credit, has shown some reticence in intervening \u2013 and yet he likes to threaten military action around the world and US forces continue to drop bombs on foreign countries. Actions by western powers are based on a belief in their moral superiority and also in their right to impose that superiority on others through force rather than example. In the days of empire, such imposition at least had the quality of effectiveness. Today it has not. The devastation of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are only the most prominent examples of intervention failure. Britain no longer has the capacity to impose peace or democracy on the world. What it does have is the opportunity to set an example in its own democratic behaviour \u2013 not exactly a shining one at present. Its foreign policy should not be to aid war \u2013 to add fuel to the flames of violence round the world is inexcusable. The arms fair starting in London tomorrow should never be repeated. It would help if the opposition parties said so. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The head of the TUC has called for parliament to outlaw discrimination against working-class people at work, in an impassioned speech calling for parity of opportunity for lower-paid employees. In her address to the union umbrella body\u2019s annual conference, Frances O\u2019Grady reinforced demands that companies should be forced to report any gaps in pay between workers from different social backgrounds. Addressing hundreds of union delegates in Brighton, the general secretary said: \u201cI want to issue a challenge to politicians. It\u2019s high time we outlawed discrimination against working-class people. Let\u2019s change the law and stamp out class prejudice once and for all.\u201d She said the UK was wasting talent and skills because working-class people were shut out of opportunities. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to rise by hard graft and talent alone. The system is rigged from the start. Where you come from. What your parents do. Your accent. Which school you went to. If you\u2019re from a working-class family, the odds are stacked against you,\u201d she said. O\u2019Grady illustrated her argument by raising the behaviour of the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was widely criticised for slouching across three seats in the chamber during a crucial Brexit debate last week. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, Britain is still blighted by old-fashioned snobbery, too. Inflated egos and a sense of entitlement. Picture Jacob Rees-Mogg. Treating the government frontbench like his own living room sofa,\u201d she said. The TUC has said that without new laws, people from working-class backgrounds will continue to face direct forms of discrimination, such as employer bias during job applications and interviews. It has also warned of indirect forms of discrimination such as the use of unpaid internships as a gateway into jobs. Issuing a challenge to the \u201cHovis ad\u201d image, O\u2019Grady redefined the term working class for the present day. \u201cToday\u2019s working class looks like modern Britain. As likely to work in an office as a factory. To be a care assistant, as a car worker. And to wear a hijab, as a football shirt. Or, quite possibly, both,\u201d she said. O\u2019Grady also issued another warning that the union movement would take action if Boris Johnson attempted to trick the UK into a no-deal Brexit or refused to obey the law. \u201cIf the prime minister tries to trick us or refuses to obey the law that stops no deal and workers vote to strike to defend their jobs, then the gloves are off. And I want to make this crystal clear \u2013 this whole movement will stand together,\u201d she said.",

To save anyone going to any trouble in the comments, let\u2019s agree not to include the Old and New Testaments (God\u2019s, not Atwood\u2019s), nor make any unseemly jokes about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/18/george-rr-martin-interview-game-of-thrones-at-own-pace-now\">George RR Martin</a> going for the record with the oft-delayed The Winds of Winter, the next book in his A Song of Ice And Fire cycle (a short eight years so far).</p> <p>We can certainly point the finger at Stephen King, though. His third novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/22/rereading-stephen-king-the-shining\">The Shining</a> was published in 1977, about the slow descent into supernatural madness by recovering alcoholic and struggling writer Jack Torrance, who takes his family to live in a deserted hotel where he has become the off-season caretaker. The sequel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/25/doctor-sleep-stephen-king-review\">Doctor Sleep</a>, was published 36 years later in 2013, concentrating on Torrance\u2019s son Danny and his ability to tap into the paranormal world, or \u201cshining\u201d. Of the 36-year wait, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/21/stephen-king-shining-sequel-interview\">King told the Guardian</a> that he\u2019d always found himself wondering what happened to Danny after The Shining: \u201cAnd I thought, well, let\u2019s find out.\u201d</p> <p>King had well-documented issues with alcohol, as does Danny in Doctor Sleep, which served as a way of exploring addiction with the benefit of hindsight. In a similar vein, John Updike took 24 years to write a follow-up to his 1984 novel The Witches of Eastwick. Updike said he wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/25/updike\">The Widows of Eastwick</a> because, \u201cTaking those women into old age would be a way of writing about old age, my old age.\u201d</p> <p>For many writers of advanced years, revisiting characters they created in their youth is a way of adding context to both their writing and personal lives. Updike was 75 when The Widows of Eastwick was published, and died the following year. Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/josephheller\">Joseph Heller</a> began writing his war satire Catch-22 in 1953 when he was 30; it was eventually published in 1961 and was followed by Closing Time 33 years later, catching up with Yossarian in 1990s New York. <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/home/heller-conversation.html\">He told the New York Times</a> that, at the age of 71, Closing Time was \u201cMy summing-up, yes. Not my swan song.\u201d It was his last novel before his death in December 1999.</p> <p>Perhaps the novel with the longest wait \u2013 and the most controversy \u2013 is Harper Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/19/go-set-watchman-harper-lee-review-literary-curiosity\">Go Set a Watchman</a>. There was great excitement in 2015 when it was announced the manuscript had been discovered among Lee\u2019s belongings. For decades it was assumed To Kill a Mockingbird was her only work. But claims emerged that Watchman was actually an earlier draft of Mockingbird, not a true sequel, and dark questions were raised about Lee\u2019s ability to consent to its publication due to her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/go-set-a-watchman-harper-lee-legacy-to-kill-a-mockingbird\">age and declining health</a>. She died aged 89 in February 2016, just a few months after the publication of her second novel, which came 55 years after her first.</p> <p>Other long gaps include the 49 years between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ray-bradbury\">Ray Bradbury</a>\u2019s Dandelion Wine (1957) and Farewell Summer, the quarter-century it took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/28/bret-easton-ellis-millennials-white-interview\">Bret Easton Ellis</a> to revisit his debut novel Less Than Zero with 2010\u2019s Imperial Bedrooms and \u2014 to make George RR Martin feel a little better \u2014 the 17 years it took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien\">JRR Tolkien</a> to follow up The Hobbit with The Lord of the Rings. Who among today\u2019s authors are eyeing up their early works with plans for a sequel? I for one look forward to The Pensioner on the Train in 2044.</p>",

It\u2019s debatable whether Atwood would have ever returned to Gilead but for two things: the hit TV adaptation of her 1985 novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and that Donald Trump\u2019s administration seems to be using the original as some sort of guidebook to run the US. A long time between books, certainly \u2013 there are members of Congress who weren\u2019t yet born when The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was published \u2013 but by no means the biggest gap in publishing history. So let\u2019s look at some of the longest waits readers have had for sequels. To save anyone going to any trouble in the comments, let\u2019s agree not to include the Old and New Testaments (God\u2019s, not Atwood\u2019s), nor make any unseemly jokes about George RR Martin going for the record with the oft-delayed The Winds of Winter, the next book in his A Song of Ice And Fire cycle (a short eight years so far). We can certainly point the finger at Stephen King, though. His third novel The Shining was published in 1977, about the slow descent into supernatural madness by recovering alcoholic and struggling writer Jack Torrance, who takes his family to live in a deserted hotel where he has become the off-season caretaker. The sequel, Doctor Sleep, was published 36 years later in 2013, concentrating on Torrance\u2019s son Danny and his ability to tap into the paranormal world, or \u201cshining\u201d. Of the 36-year wait, King told the Guardian that he\u2019d always found himself wondering what happened to Danny after The Shining: \u201cAnd I thought, well, let\u2019s find out.\u201d King had well-documented issues with alcohol, as does Danny in Doctor Sleep, which served as a way of exploring addiction with the benefit of hindsight. In a similar vein, John Updike took 24 years to write a follow-up to his 1984 novel The Witches of Eastwick. Updike said he wrote The Widows of Eastwick because, \u201cTaking those women into old age would be a way of writing about old age, my old age.\u201d For many writers of advanced years, revisiting characters they created in their youth is a way of adding context to both their writing and personal lives. Updike was 75 when The Widows of Eastwick was published, and died the following year. Likewise, Joseph Heller began writing his war satire Catch-22 in 1953 when he was 30; it was eventually published in 1961 and was followed by Closing Time 33 years later, catching up with Yossarian in 1990s New York. He told the New York Times that, at the age of 71, Closing Time was \u201cMy summing-up, yes. Not my swan song.\u201d It was his last novel before his death in December 1999. Perhaps the novel with the longest wait \u2013 and the most controversy \u2013 is Harper Lee\u2019s Go Set a Watchman. There was great excitement in 2015 when it was announced the manuscript had been discovered among Lee\u2019s belongings. For decades it was assumed To Kill a Mockingbird was her only work. But claims emerged that Watchman was actually an earlier draft of Mockingbird, not a true sequel, and dark questions were raised about Lee\u2019s ability to consent to its publication due to her age and declining health. She died aged 89 in February 2016, just a few months after the publication of her second novel, which came 55 years after her first. Other long gaps include the 49 years between Ray Bradbury\u2019s Dandelion Wine (1957) and Farewell Summer, the quarter-century it took Bret Easton Ellis to revisit his debut novel Less Than Zero with 2010\u2019s Imperial Bedrooms and \u2014 to make George RR Martin feel a little better \u2014 the 17 years it took JRR Tolkien to follow up The Hobbit with The Lord of the Rings. Who among today\u2019s authors are eyeing up their early works with plans for a sequel? I for one look forward to The Pensioner on the Train in 2044.",

His tenacity and the sheer weight of his runs would have tempered the domination of Steve Smith. But Cook has been refreshed, while playing county cricket for Essex, and produced a fascinating and layered book that delves into the psychological challenges of the game.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fact that I went out on my own terms, with an ending like that, made it so special. You can't buy that sort of stuff</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Written with the consistently excellent Michael Calvin, Cook\u2019s autobiography is a timely read at the end of an exhilarating yet flawed summer for English cricket. From an incredible World Cup final to a gripping Ashes series where his former teammates have veered from the heroic to the shambolic, Cook has been absorbed.</p> <p>Yet it seems right to start with Tuesday\u2019s anniversary of his final innings. He and Calvin have written an evocative first chapter about that blissful day, even if much of the book covers darker terrain, and Cook says: \u201cOne day I\u2019ll watch it ball by ball. On the highlights you look quite a good player \u2013 but I played and missed five times in a row against Mohammed Shami. When I finally hit one I had a massive smile.\u201d</p> <p>Cook grins again. \u201cMost people get the terrible phone call saying you\u2019re dropped, and never playing again, which takes a long time to get over. The fact that I went out on my own terms, with an ending like that, made it so special. I had 30 of my friends in the box when I got that hundred.

They are being made to pay for neglecting the basics of Test cricket while prioritising the World Cup. \u201cThe country is going through one of those little periods where they\u2019re a bit short,\u201d he says of the dearth of opening batsmen. But Cook concedes that, once Andrew Strauss retired in 2012, none of his 14 subsequent partners lasted. That \u201clittle period\u201d stretches across seven years.</p> <p>\u201cSam Robson was interesting,\u201d Cook says as he picks out one of the 14. \u201cHe did OK, and scored a hundred in his second game, but kept on getting out the same way. In Test cricket there are few hiding places and you\u2019re not used to the scrutiny.\u201d</p> <p>Preparing for what proved his final Test innings, in 2014, Robson seemed transfixed as he watched a montage of his previous dismissals on television. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThe TV was on, we\u2019re waiting to bat and he saw himself get out again and again. Unfortunately he was out the same way and hasn\u2019t played since. It would be interesting to ask Sam what he remembers of his Test career [with an average of 30.54 after seven caps] and how he would change it. Sam felt the difference between county and Test cricket and those are the players the ECB should speak to so we can help educate the next guys.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve always had Lara, Ponting and Kallis as the three best batsmen I\u2019ve ever seen.

[Rob] Yates at Warwickshire is definitely in my mould and grinds it out.

His God-given talent, apart from his work ethic and hand-eye co-ordination, is extraordinary. He nicks the ball far less than any other player ever \u2013 maybe with the exception of Don Bradman.

Cook remembers that \u201cDavid Warner, a couple of beers into his celebration, mentioned that he used substances attached to the strapping on his hand to accelerate the deterioration of the ball during a first-class match. I looked at Steve Smith who shot a glance that said: \u2018Ooh, you shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p> <p>Did the Australians use sandpaper to tamper with the ball before they were caught doing so in Cape Town in March 2018? \u201cStuart Broad sums it up pretty well and says they got the ball to reverse swing in that Ashes. Why change what you\u2019ve been doing? Why suddenly use sandpaper? People know what was going on. But it\u2019s been the best thing for Australian cricket because they realised it wasn\u2019t acceptable. The win-at-all-costs culture they created isn\u2019t what the Australian public needed or wanted. They\u2019d gone too far.\u201d</p> <p>Australia have retained the Ashes but, at Headingley, Ben Stokes hit a monumental 135 not out as England passed a target of 358 \u2013 after being bowled out for 67 in the first innings. Cook describes Stokes as one of the cricketers to whom he is closest. He also says Stokes is the best team player he has known in putting his desire for England\u2019s success above personal milestones.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think the Bristol case made Ben realise that not many people can bat, bowl and field like he can \u2013 and he had to make the most of his talents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cCricket is such a stats-based game for each player but no one knows Tiger Woods\u2019s average round. They just know Woods has won 15 majors. As cricketers we\u2019re judged on the average we have from being a 21-year-old who\u2019s just come into international cricket to the day you retire. What should matter is the impact you have on games. Stokesy will always have an average around 35, and 30 with the ball, but that\u2019s misleading. He wins massive games of cricket.\u201d</p> <p>Cook believes that Stokes has been transformed by the assault charges brought against him in a Bristol court after a violent altercation in 2017. He was cleared eventually and Stokes has been making up for it ever since. \u201cBristol had a major impact on him because he realised what he could have lost. I feel I\u2019ve said a couple of things to him at certain times, or had his back on certain things, that have helped him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he came in under my captaincy he was rough around the edges. But in his second Test he played an unbelievable innings in Perth when there was such a crack in the pitch. I\u2019m mentally fairly decent but it was unnerving and I went first ball. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QZ68ZGLXaY\" title=\"\">Ben batted incredibly</a> [scoring 120]. The fact he played like that, at 22, makes him the maverick he is. I did guide [Stokes] a little and had that affinity with him. But the last thing I want is to take any credit for what he\u2019s done. I think the Bristol case made him realise that not many people can bat, bowl and field like he can \u2013 and he had to make the most of his talents.\u201d</p> <p>Cook was in the commentary box, on Test Match Special, when Stokes and Jack Leach put on 76 for the last wicket to seal that Headingley victory. \u201cI was actually on air,\u201d Cook says of the moment Stokes hit the winning four. \u201cThere are some great clips on the internet of me and Glenn McGrath. I didn\u2019t realise it but Glenn threw down his headset \u2013 I wish I\u2019d seen that. But you\u2019re engrossed in the game, living and breathing it.\u201d</p> <p>He is still so close to the England team that, after the match, he joined them in the dressing room. \u201cI was very conscious not to overstay my welcome. But I wanted to see Ben and congratulate him personally. I know life moves on and you are replaceable but I was lucky enough to have a beer with the guys.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"568d432000bf1477833b667484e8e1dccdbb3e80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/568d432000bf1477833b667484e8e1dccdbb3e80/0_47_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cook has been working in a media role but is still close to the England team and his successor as England captain, Joe Root.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook has been working in a media role but is still close to the England team and his successor as England captain, Joe Root.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was there bedlam in the dressing room? \u201cIt was more shock. Normally with a Test win the music\u2019s blaring but we watched the highlights round the tiniest screen. Everyone was like: \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s just happened?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Neither Australia nor England are great teams, despite the presence of Smith, Stokes and some very fine fast bowlers, but they have produced a riveting series. \u201cTest cricket is changing,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously down to the influence of T20 and the fact that batters now have to master three formats. I had to master one. There are times when the one-day game is so formulaic. Every time you open the batting you\u2019ve got to score at least eight runs an over. In Test cricket that doesn\u2019t happen. There are times you\u2019ve got to suck it up and bat for a draw.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best way of protecting Test cricket is to have less of it. Make it more of a marquee event</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Have the Ashes given Cook renewed hope that Test cricket will continue to thrive? \u201c[Last] week we had two Tests. Old Trafford and West Indies against India, who are the biggest powerhouse. They were lucky if they had 25 spectators. Manchester was sold out every day. But that\u2019s not the reality of Test cricket away from England. Something needs to be done.\u201d</p> <p>What is Cook\u2019s solution? \u201cFranchise cricket is here to stay because of the money. But the best way of protecting Test cricket is to have less of it. Make it more of a marquee event. Not a case of: \u2018Oh, we\u2019re playing an Ashes again in 14 months.\u2019 If we play less Test cricket it becomes more special. And then the best players don\u2019t have to choose between franchise and Test cricket.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/08/england-individual-heroics-australia-potency\">England find individual heroics are no match for Australia\u2019s potency | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How has Cook replaced the intensity of his consuming career? \u201cIt\u2019s more a loss of a goal. All I ever wanted to do was play cricket for England and be successful. Now it\u2019s over, there has been a transition and playing for Essex has helped.

Then, driven by the determination that means only Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid scored more runs than he did in his 161 Tests, Cook hit a magical 147 in the second innings. His new autobiography still carries an opening line in which Cook apologises to his teammates for getting out in that game against India at the Oval. He was only 33, and fitter than ever, but Test cricket had drained him and sealed his international retirement. England, who failed to win back the Ashes when they lost to Australia at Old Trafford on Sunday, have missed Cook terribly. His tenacity and the sheer weight of his runs would have tempered the domination of Steve Smith. But Cook has been refreshed, while playing county cricket for Essex, and produced a fascinating and layered book that delves into the psychological challenges of the game.

I think the Bristol case made him realise that not many people can bat, bowl and field like he can \u2013 and he had to make the most of his talents.\u201d Cook was in the commentary box, on Test Match Special, when Stokes and Jack Leach put on 76 for the last wicket to seal that Headingley victory. \u201cI was actually on air,\u201d Cook says of the moment Stokes hit the winning four. \u201cThere are some great clips on the internet of me and Glenn McGrath. I didn\u2019t realise it but Glenn threw down his headset \u2013 I wish I\u2019d seen that. But you\u2019re engrossed in the game, living and breathing it.\u201d He is still so close to the England team that, after the match, he joined them in the dressing room. \u201cI was very conscious not to overstay my welcome. But I wanted to see Ben and congratulate him personally. I know life moves on and you are replaceable but I was lucky enough to have a beer with the guys.\u201d Was there bedlam in the dressing room? \u201cIt was more shock. Normally with a Test win the music\u2019s blaring but we watched the highlights round the tiniest screen. Everyone was like: \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s just happened?\u2019\u201d Neither Australia nor England are great teams, despite the presence of Smith, Stokes and some very fine fast bowlers, but they have produced a riveting series. \u201cTest cricket is changing,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously down to the influence of T20 and the fact that batters now have to master three formats. I had to master one. There are times when the one-day game is so formulaic. Every time you open the batting you\u2019ve got to score at least eight runs an over. In Test cricket that doesn\u2019t happen. There are times you\u2019ve got to suck it up and bat for a draw.\u201d Have the Ashes given Cook renewed hope that Test cricket will continue to thrive? \u201c[Last] week we had two Tests. Old Trafford and West Indies against India, who are the biggest powerhouse. They were lucky if they had 25 spectators. Manchester was sold out every day. But that\u2019s not the reality of Test cricket away from England. Something needs to be done.\u201d What is Cook\u2019s solution? \u201cFranchise cricket is here to stay because of the money. But the best way of protecting Test cricket is to have less of it. Make it more of a marquee event. Not a case of: \u2018Oh, we\u2019re playing an Ashes again in 14 months.\u2019 If we play less Test cricket it becomes more special. And then the best players don\u2019t have to choose between franchise and Test cricket.\u201d How has Cook replaced the intensity of his consuming career? \u201cIt\u2019s more a loss of a goal. All I ever wanted to do was play cricket for England and be successful. Now it\u2019s over, there has been a transition and playing for Essex has helped. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re falling off a cliff. But I haven\u2019t missed Test cricket because I was ready to go. Of course there have been moments I\u2019ve thought: \u2018Oh God, I\u2019ll never do that again.\u2019 But, ultimately, I was very satisfied with my career \u2013 which makes it easier to step away.\u201d Sir Alastair Cook: The Autobiography is out now (Michael Joseph \u00a320)",

Oshodi, now 53, has a calm and meditative presence. But alone, he was shaken. \u201cI was absolutely terrified, he says. \u201cBut I was absolutely sure I wouldn\u2019t let them burn the houses.\u201d</p> \n<p>That evening, in June 1996, Oshodi was packing up his tools. He had just finished fitting a skylight in his home-to-be in Nubia Way: a row of 13 timber frame chalets being gradually assembled by members of the city\u2019s first black self-build housing co-operative.</p> \n<p>Nubia Way was a utopian project intended to give social renters the kind of long-term security usually reserved for home-owners, by allowing working-class tenants to buy a stake in their housing<strong> </strong>using labour in place of cash. The brainchild of radical Colombian housing organiser Jos\u00e9 Ospina, the homes were to be self-built by a co-operative of African-Caribbean Londoners, called Fusions Jameen, but held in perpetuity by a housing association to rent securely to people in housing need \u2013 first, the self-builders themselves, and then to others when the builders moved on.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Everybody here got a new qualification or a new job.

As a result of self-building, \u201ceverybody here got a new qualification or a new job,\u201d says Errol Hall, 53, who left the Home Office to become a community worker after meeting other members of the co-op. \u201cIt boosts your confidence when you can do something like this, and that\u2019s part of the story here.\u201d</p> \n<p>The two developments built by Fusions \u2013 21 houses over two sites at Nubia Way and Brockley, both in the borough of Lewisham \u2013 were Europe\u2019s largest black-led self-build scheme, which today houses people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. \u201cThis is the beauty of what Jose did,\u201d Oshodi says. \u201cPeople who had bad credit records, people who were in greatest housing need, anybody could build and get excellent housing if you were prepared to give your labour.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"34ec9662-e4bf-4b5e-940d-3954cb2f9348\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P4PGfckBS8A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The skylight Oshodi was installing that evening was a small personal luxury, paid for out of his own pocket, to add to the half-built home he would live in: \u201ca double-sized one above the bed so you could see the moon\u201d. He laughs when remembering that his first thought, as he saw the men approach, carrying chains and a can of petrol, was to protect his new window: \u201cI thought they were here to nick my Velux!\u201d</p> \n<p>But they were not there to steal. In the mid-90s, Downham was one of the most notorious centres for extreme-right activity in the country.<strong> </strong>The area borders Grove Park, notorious as the place where in 1993 Stephen Lawrence set off on the bus journey that ended with<strong> </strong>his racist murder. For months in the summer of 1996, a string of attacks, particularly focused on black bus drivers, meant that <a href=\"http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/soundings/12_26.pdf\">buses were diverted away from Downham after 6pm</a>.</p> \n<p>The area made news repeatedly for lawlessness: the Downham schoolteacher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/20/1\">Alison Moore\u2019s home was invaded by men in balaclavas</a> who sprayed a swastika and \u201cNF\u201d (National Front) graffiti on the walls.

Over the two years of construction, residents faced racial harassment and three arson attacks, two of which damaged houses. One was hand-signed with an NF tag. Oshodi\u2019s own confrontation with would-be arsonists ended with no damage thanks to a bluff \u2013 he shouted out as if for friends waiting nearby. Faced with Oshodi clasping a hammer and the prospect of backup, the attackers backed away.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>To think of losing all this and living god knows where \u2013 I couldn't.

A proposed merger with another housing association failed in February.</p> \n<p>In an effort to fill the funding gap, Chisel has already asked the self-builders of Nubia Way to give up their rent discounts. These discounts, that reduce weekly rents by up to 40% compared to rent paid by tenants in conventional housing or Nubia Way houses built by others, are a contractual benefit they receive in recognition of their labour in building the homes. For some residents \u2013 those who put in the greatest number of hours and therefore earned the largest discounts \u2013 this could increase rents by as much as \u00a350 a week: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a person on fixed income, or benefits, which wouldn\u2019t cover all of that increase, \u00a350 is completely untenable,\u201d says Hall.</p> \n<p>\u201cI built this house. We all built all of them, actually,\u201d says Howard, standing in front of his porch. \u201cTo think of losing all this and living god knows where \u2013 I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d rather be bloody dead, to be honest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nubia Way today resembles a compact alpine resort, nestled among the surrounding 1920s stock brick estates. A lane of cheerful wooden<strong> </strong>homes built using a low-skill system devised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/16/anarchism-community-walter-segal-self-build-south-london-estate\">modernist architect Walter Segal</a>, it boasts environmental credentials that were groundbreaking in the 90s, such as recycled insulation and sedum grass roofs, and <a href=\"https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/353685.award-for-self-build-homes-scheme/\">earned awards</a> for its low-carbon design from the Royal Institute of British Architects and Lewisham council. A narrow park behind the houses, once a dumping ground for old sofas, nappies and needles, has been restored with the help of Nubia Way residents \u2013 part of the legacy of self-led local interventions that self-builders have contributed to the area\u2019s regeneration.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de8c887908b23ee55db491a4ab7525c5ab4e8ab7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de8c887908b23ee55db491a4ab7525c5ab4e8ab7/14_46_726_435/500.jpg\" alt=\"Two self-builders assemble scaffolding at the front of the one of the Nubia Way houses.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two self-builders assemble scaffolding at the front of the one of the Nubia Way houses.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Howard</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most Segal-style self-builds, such as eco-developments at Allerton Park in Leeds and Ashley Vale in Bristol, were built by tradespeople with means or as the type of luxury projects featured on property programmes like Grand Designs. From the outset, Nubia Way was designed to be different.</p> \n<p>Oshodi, who had graduated from the London School of Economics in 1987 and worked on housing projects for Croydon council, became inspired while working on a co-operative farm in Zimbabwe. Freedom fighters involved in the struggle to overthrow white minority rule had set up communally after independence: \u201cI thought, if they could do that there, surely ordinary people can improve our lives here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back in Britain, Oshodi joined Fusions Jameen in the mid-90s. Most British co-operatives, despite being outwardly bohemian, had long remained nepotistic havens that excluded working-class minorities, he says. Fusions, however, explicitly aimed to take African-Caribbean tenants off council waiting lists.</p> \n<p>Ospina, who had first learned about co-operative housing in the 1970s as a student squatting in his native Colombia, founded Chisel in 1987 to provide management services to a group of independent housing co-ops like Fusions and connect them with mainstream grants.</p> \n<p>Following his \u201cSelf-Build for Rent\u201d model, Chisel would act as the development agent \u2013 working to secure land, funding and planning \u2013 and Fusions Jameen as the building contractor.</p> \n<p>At the core of this agreement was the notion of \u201csweat equity\u201d: self-builders\u2019 investment, typically between 20 and 40 hours each week and totalling more than 1000 hours, is recognised with a secure equity share and rental discount. Today, many self-builders retain a \u201cpremium\u201d linked to their discount: they will be paid out \u2013 to the tune of thousands of pounds \u2013 if they move house or decide to cash in the share, but lose their rental discount if they do so.</p> \n<p>Old, colour-warped VHS footage shows Nubia Way taking shape.

If they were to play out here, we knew that our neighbours would look out for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>After building, Hall started working in citizens\u2019 advice, specialising in helping single fathers. He recognised the impact of self-building secure homes on his neighbours. \u201cWhat I saw,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich was amazing to me, was men re-establishing contact with their children, families got back together, moved in.\u201d</p> \n<p>The street shows that housing development can happen in tune with residents\u2019 beliefs, Oshodi says. He cites the pan-Africanist ideals popularised by Desmond Tutu, who lived and preached in Grove Park from 1972 until his return to South Africa in 1975: \u201cDesmond Tutu says there\u2019s a thing called <em>ubuntu</em>, where we are stronger through our community.\u201d</p> \n<p>Crucially, the fact that the tenants built their own homes meant that instead of paying contractors, they could channel government grants into infrastructure, such as water mains, to make the development of slim plots like Nubia Way economically viable.</p> \n<p>These tradeoffs were not limited to construction: each night while Nubia Way was being built, one of the self-builders had the job of sleeping in a small caravan to guard the site and materials. \u201cThe bottom line is: the only way that it could become economical is if we provided our labour for free,\u201d says Oshodi.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17f94d2bb6abe05092939145c588ddf21cb21b56\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17f94d2bb6abe05092939145c588ddf21cb21b56/0_119_1756_1054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A self-builder works on the wiring of one of the Nubia Way houses in 1996/7 .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A self-builder works on the wiring of one of the Nubia Way houses in 1996/1997.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorraine Cameron</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chisel\u2019s founder says there is no doubt that self-builders were supposed to keep discounts for the whole time they remained in homes. \u201cOur intention was to create a bridge between social ownership and owner-occupation, to create a guarantee of shareholding by the occupants, that couldn\u2019t be eroded and couldn\u2019t be taken away,\u201d says Ospina, who left London for Ireland in the late 90s and continues to advocate for alternative housing provision.</p> \n<p>Ospina says that taking away benefits earned in labour would leave tenants with no more than a conventional social tenancy and no stake in Nubia Way, \u201cwhich is exactly what we were trying to move away from\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSadly, the powers that be seem to be trying to move back in that direction,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very retrograde step. And I hope that it can be countered.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the decades since Nubia Way was completed, Chisel\u2019s development from idealistic pioneer to formalised housing provider has been far from smooth. For years the Nubia Way homes were managed by another housing association as Chisel languished in government supervision for a catalogue of failings, says Jo Hillier, director of Chisel in the 2000s. Poor organisation meant some residents were simply never issued with contracts that correctly showed the discounts they had earned, leaving them more vulnerable, now, than they ought to be.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The principle of black people giving something, giving your labour, creating that social housing that\u2019s there for ever, and them just saying \u2018eff-off\u2019</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Tim Oshodi</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But today most residents want Nubia Way to remain with Chisel. Tenants understand that difficulties arrived with the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016, which required social landlords to reduce rents by 1% each year for a four-year period. These small reductions have cumulatively resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/government-confirms-five-year-rent-settlement-after-consultation-60309\">16% reduction to social landlords\u2019 projected revenues</a>, according to the industry magazine Inside Housing, and have kicked off a series of cuts and mergers between housing associations.</p> \n<p>On 14 August, a group of Nubia Way residents, including both self-builders and newer arrivals, met Lewisham East MP Janet Daby to hand over a letter demanding that Chisel stop current plans and allow tenants to make alternative proposals for addressing the shortfall. These residents believe costs should continue to be borne collectively, albeit with the original self-builders retaining rent reductions.</p> \n<p>Tenants have also cast doubt on projected costs for repairs, including \u00a340,000 to replace each leaking grass roof. Chisel\u2019s board have now promised to review the estimates, but warned that the much-loved eco-roofs may simply be too expensive to fix.</p> \n<p>Louise Owen, the chair of Chisel\u2019s board \u2013 who built her own home at a nearby Chisel self-build project \u2013 says spreading costs won\u2019t be easy. \u201cIt is really, really hard to justify putting up everyone\u2019s rents unless we have tried every other avenue,\u201d says Owen. \u201cAnd one of the avenues is increasing the discount rent.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2763cae0f683bbae5eb07df8331cbe3adbaf4786\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2763cae0f683bbae5eb07df8331cbe3adbaf4786/0_0_2550_3507/727.jpg\" alt=\"A poster advertising the Nubia Way to potential self-builders that was posted around Lewisham in 1995/6 .\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster advertising the Nubia Way to potential self-builders that was posted around Lewisham in 1995/6 .</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Created by Peter Coker</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Eliminating discounts is \u201ckey\u201d, confirms Chisel\u2019s managing director, Pauline Goodfellow.

      "bodyText": "It is more than two decades since Tim Oshodi stood between a row of partly built houses in Downham, south-east London, and a gang of men who intended to burn them to the ground. Oshodi, now 53, has a calm and meditative presence. But alone, he was shaken. \u201cI was absolutely terrified, he says. \u201cBut I was absolutely sure I wouldn\u2019t let them burn the houses.\u201d That evening, in June 1996, Oshodi was packing up his tools. He had just finished fitting a skylight in his home-to-be in Nubia Way: a row of 13 timber frame chalets being gradually assembled by members of the city\u2019s first black self-build housing co-operative. Nubia Way was a utopian project intended to give social renters the kind of long-term security usually reserved for home-owners, by allowing working-class tenants to buy a stake in their housing using labour in place of cash. The brainchild of radical Colombian housing organiser Jos\u00e9 Ospina, the homes were to be self-built by a co-operative of African-Caribbean Londoners, called Fusions Jameen, but held in perpetuity by a housing association to rent securely to people in housing need \u2013 first, the self-builders themselves, and then to others when the builders moved on. The self-build process was meant to demonstrate a viable alternative to the norms of owner-occupation or conventional social renting, and treated housing as a potentially transformative process for individuals and the community. As a result of self-building, \u201ceverybody here got a new qualification or a new job,\u201d says Errol Hall, 53, who left the Home Office to become a community worker after meeting other members of the co-op. \u201cIt boosts your confidence when you can do something like this, and that\u2019s part of the story here.\u201d The two developments built by Fusions \u2013 21 houses over two sites at Nubia Way and Brockley, both in the borough of Lewisham \u2013 were Europe\u2019s largest black-led self-build scheme, which today houses people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. \u201cThis is the beauty of what Jose did,\u201d Oshodi says. \u201cPeople who had bad credit records, people who were in greatest housing need, anybody could build and get excellent housing if you were prepared to give your labour.\u201d The skylight Oshodi was installing that evening was a small personal luxury, paid for out of his own pocket, to add to the half-built home he would live in: \u201ca double-sized one above the bed so you could see the moon\u201d. He laughs when remembering that his first thought, as he saw the men approach, carrying chains and a can of petrol, was to protect his new window: \u201cI thought they were here to nick my Velux!\u201d But they were not there to steal. In the mid-90s, Downham was one of the most notorious centres for extreme-right activity in the country. The area borders Grove Park, notorious as the place where in 1993 Stephen Lawrence set off on the bus journey that ended with his racist murder. For months in the summer of 1996, a string of attacks, particularly focused on black bus drivers, meant that buses were diverted away from Downham after 6pm. The area made news repeatedly for lawlessness: the Downham schoolteacher Alison Moore\u2019s home was invaded by men in balaclavas who sprayed a swastika and \u201cNF\u201d (National Front) graffiti on the walls. Local youth worker Nick Jeffrey recalls youths hijacking a train. In a 2002 council by-election in Downham, one in five voters backed the far-right BNP. Nubia Way resident Andre Howard, 65, remembers one extreme-right council candidate saying he was driven to stand for election by the black self-builders, who the local rumour mill claimed were foreign refugees. Over the two years of construction, residents faced racial harassment and three arson attacks, two of which damaged houses. One was hand-signed with an NF tag. Oshodi\u2019s own confrontation with would-be arsonists ended with no damage thanks to a bluff \u2013 he shouted out as if for friends waiting nearby. Faced with Oshodi clasping a hammer and the prospect of backup, the attackers backed away. Nubia Way survived the racist attacks, but now faces a new threat. Chisel, the housing association that owns the houses on Nubia Way along with more than 200 other self-build and conventional homes, is faced with a \u00a34.2m funding shortfall. A proposed merger with another housing association failed in February. In an effort to fill the funding gap, Chisel has already asked the self-builders of Nubia Way to give up their rent discounts. These discounts, that reduce weekly rents by up to 40% compared to rent paid by tenants in conventional housing or Nubia Way houses built by others, are a contractual benefit they receive in recognition of their labour in building the homes. For some residents \u2013 those who put in the greatest number of hours and therefore earned the largest discounts \u2013 this could increase rents by as much as \u00a350 a week: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a person on fixed income, or benefits, which wouldn\u2019t cover all of that increase, \u00a350 is completely untenable,\u201d says Hall. \u201cI built this house. We all built all of them, actually,\u201d says Howard, standing in front of his porch. \u201cTo think of losing all this and living god knows where \u2013 I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d rather be bloody dead, to be honest.\u201d Nubia Way today resembles a compact alpine resort, nestled among the surrounding 1920s stock brick estates. A lane of cheerful wooden homes built using a low-skill system devised by the modernist architect Walter Segal, it boasts environmental credentials that were groundbreaking in the 90s, such as recycled insulation and sedum grass roofs, and earned awards for its low-carbon design from the Royal Institute of British Architects and Lewisham council. A narrow park behind the houses, once a dumping ground for old sofas, nappies and needles, has been restored with the help of Nubia Way residents \u2013 part of the legacy of self-led local interventions that self-builders have contributed to the area\u2019s regeneration. Most Segal-style self-builds, such as eco-developments at Allerton Park in Leeds and Ashley Vale in Bristol, were built by tradespeople with means or as the type of luxury projects featured on property programmes like Grand Designs. From the outset, Nubia Way was designed to be different. Oshodi, who had graduated from the London School of Economics in 1987 and worked on housing projects for Croydon council, became inspired while working on a co-operative farm in Zimbabwe. Freedom fighters involved in the struggle to overthrow white minority rule had set up communally after independence: \u201cI thought, if they could do that there, surely ordinary people can improve our lives here.\u201d Back in Britain, Oshodi joined Fusions Jameen in the mid-90s. Most British co-operatives, despite being outwardly bohemian, had long remained nepotistic havens that excluded working-class minorities, he says. Fusions, however, explicitly aimed to take African-Caribbean tenants off council waiting lists. Ospina, who had first learned about co-operative housing in the 1970s as a student squatting in his native Colombia, founded Chisel in 1987 to provide management services to a group of independent housing co-ops like Fusions and connect them with mainstream grants. Following his \u201cSelf-Build for Rent\u201d model, Chisel would act as the development agent \u2013 working to secure land, funding and planning \u2013 and Fusions Jameen as the building contractor. At the core of this agreement was the notion of \u201csweat equity\u201d: self-builders\u2019 investment, typically between 20 and 40 hours each week and totalling more than 1000 hours, is recognised with a secure equity share and rental discount. Today, many self-builders retain a \u201cpremium\u201d linked to their discount: they will be paid out \u2013 to the tune of thousands of pounds \u2013 if they move house or decide to cash in the share, but lose their rental discount if they do so. Old, colour-warped VHS footage shows Nubia Way taking shape. On the construction site, self-builders \u2013 some single parents holding kids \u2013 hammer and measure timber, wearing hard hats and loud, patterned 90s jumpers. A few tell the camera that self-building is their sole chance for a safe, clean house. Errol Hall is seen in his 20s \u2013 visibly shyer than the bold speaker he is today \u2013 and calls it \u201ca dream come true\u201d. Hall\u2019s son was born during construction. \u201cI was getting laughed out of council offices and housing associations,\u201d Hall says today. \u201cAs a single man who was responsible for a child, there was no chance.\u201d Navlette Guy, who works for the NHS in a local paediatrician\u2019s office, also had a daughter in the first year here, while her older children tottered around the site in hard hats \u201chelping\u201d their father build. \u201cIt was absolutely brilliant,\u201d says Guy, 58. \u201cThey\u2019ve all done well, all been to university, come out, and that\u2019s a testament to having the community we have. If they were to play out here, we knew that our neighbours would look out for them.\u201d After building, Hall started working in citizens\u2019 advice, specialising in helping single fathers. He recognised the impact of self-building secure homes on his neighbours. \u201cWhat I saw,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich was amazing to me, was men re-establishing contact with their children, families got back together, moved in.\u201d The street shows that housing development can happen in tune with residents\u2019 beliefs, Oshodi says. He cites the pan-Africanist ideals popularised by Desmond Tutu, who lived and preached in Grove Park from 1972 until his return to South Africa in 1975: \u201cDesmond Tutu says there\u2019s a thing called ubuntu, where we are stronger through our community.\u201d Crucially, the fact that the tenants built their own homes meant that instead of paying contractors, they could channel government grants into infrastructure, such as water mains, to make the development of slim plots like Nubia Way economically viable. These tradeoffs were not limited to construction: each night while Nubia Way was being built, one of the self-builders had the job of sleeping in a small caravan to guard the site and materials. \u201cThe bottom line is: the only way that it could become economical is if we provided our labour for free,\u201d says Oshodi. Chisel\u2019s founder says there is no doubt that self-builders were supposed to keep discounts for the whole time they remained in homes. \u201cOur intention was to create a bridge between social ownership and owner-occupation, to create a guarantee of shareholding by the occupants, that couldn\u2019t be eroded and couldn\u2019t be taken away,\u201d says Ospina, who left London for Ireland in the late 90s and continues to advocate for alternative housing provision. Ospina says that taking away benefits earned in labour would leave tenants with no more than a conventional social tenancy and no stake in Nubia Way, \u201cwhich is exactly what we were trying to move away from\u201d. \u201cSadly, the powers that be seem to be trying to move back in that direction,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very retrograde step. And I hope that it can be countered.\u201d In the decades since Nubia Way was completed, Chisel\u2019s development from idealistic pioneer to formalised housing provider has been far from smooth. For years the Nubia Way homes were managed by another housing association as Chisel languished in government supervision for a catalogue of failings, says Jo Hillier, director of Chisel in the 2000s. Poor organisation meant some residents were simply never issued with contracts that correctly showed the discounts they had earned, leaving them more vulnerable, now, than they ought to be. But today most residents want Nubia Way to remain with Chisel. Tenants understand that difficulties arrived with the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016, which required social landlords to reduce rents by 1% each year for a four-year period. These small reductions have cumulatively resulted in a 16% reduction to social landlords\u2019 projected revenues, according to the industry magazine Inside Housing, and have kicked off a series of cuts and mergers between housing associations. On 14 August, a group of Nubia Way residents, including both self-builders and newer arrivals, met Lewisham East MP Janet Daby to hand over a letter demanding that Chisel stop current plans and allow tenants to make alternative proposals for addressing the shortfall. These residents believe costs should continue to be borne collectively, albeit with the original self-builders retaining rent reductions. Tenants have also cast doubt on projected costs for repairs, including \u00a340,000 to replace each leaking grass roof. Chisel\u2019s board have now promised to review the estimates, but warned that the much-loved eco-roofs may simply be too expensive to fix. Louise Owen, the chair of Chisel\u2019s board \u2013 who built her own home at a nearby Chisel self-build project \u2013 says spreading costs won\u2019t be easy. \u201cIt is really, really hard to justify putting up everyone\u2019s rents unless we have tried every other avenue,\u201d says Owen. \u201cAnd one of the avenues is increasing the discount rent.\u201d Eliminating discounts is \u201ckey\u201d, confirms Chisel\u2019s managing director, Pauline Goodfellow. She says Chisel plans to approach the social housing regulator for permission to eliminate reductions if residents do not agree voluntarily. But raising the discounted rents would disproportionately affect black residents, who make up the majority of self-builders on Fusions Jameen\u2019s two projects, points out Oshodi, who says he would invoke equality impact regulations in the event of such a move. He sees an echo of the Windrush scandal \u2013 of black Brits giving their lives to a community only to see their self-evident rights called into question. He says: \u201cThe principle of black people giving something, giving your labour, creating that social housing that\u2019s there for ever, and them just saying \u2018eff-off\u2019?\u201d Meanwhile, the self-build model has seen a resurgence in interest in recent years. Inspired by schemes such as Nubia Way, the Rural Urban Synthesis Society, a Lewisham-based community land trust, is developing 33 homes nearby after being awarded \u00a31m by the mayor of London\u2019s Innovation Fund. Since 2016, legislation has required all local authorities in England to host an open register allowing anyone to express interest in self-building. That just makes the situation with Chisel more dispiriting, say residents, who warn that the feasibility of future schemes is threatened if promises made during construction can be rolled back. They are left questioning what happens if homes change hands. \u201cAll over London, what you see is lucrative sites like the site we\u2019re on, they knock down social housing and they [build] expensive developments,\u201d says Hall. \u201cOur fear is that as soon as it gets into the hands of a big organisation, that they\u2019ll be looking to go down that road, or we\u2019ll completely lose control of our tenancies and our rents will go up a lot.\u201d \u201cChisel used to be a really good, inclusive landlord,\u201d he adds. Residents want it to rediscover its stated values of inclusivity and true tenant-led organisation: \u201cBecause that\u2019s how we achieved all this in the first place.\u201d Goodfellow says Chisel will not itself consider demolishing or redeveloping Nubia Way.

Chisel says plans will not progress until it has conducted further consultation with residents, but tenants are upset that decisions over the community\u2019s future might ultimately be taken out of the hands of those who built it. Oshodi, though, is defiant: \u201cNo. We\u2019re not going to lose this place. \u201cWe had to fight the NF, we did improvement and regeneration across the area. We did that because we believe in community and we believe in ourselves,.

Yet from A Day in the Death of Joe Egg in 1967 to Passion Play in 1981, Nicholas enjoyed a rich run of success in British theatre and showed a capacity to create resonant public drama out of personal experience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/09/peter-nichols-playwright-joe-egg-dies-aged-92\">Peter Nichols, playwright best known for Joe Egg, dies aged 92</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The obvious thing to say about Nichols is that he relentlessly mined his private life. After a clutch of TV plays in the early 1960s, he hit the big time in 1967 with Joe Egg, <a href=\"https://trafalgar-studios.com/shows/a-day-in-the-death-of-joe-egg/\">which is about to be revived in the West End</a>. It was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a landmark play in that Nichols dramatised the problem faced by himself and his wife, Thelma, of how to live with a disabled child. The difficulty, as Nichols acknowledged, was that of confronting the issue \u201cin a way that will prevent a sudden stampede to the exit doors\u201d. His solution was twofold: to have the characters directly address the audience and to show that domestic pain is made bearable by caustically irreverent humour. Where other dramatists might have veered towards the maudlin or sentimental, Nichols wrote a blackly funny play in which the teacher-hero typically sees God as \u201ca sort of manic-depressive rugby footballer\u201d.</p> <p>While most of Nichols\u2019s plays are deeply autobiographical, they exploit popular forms and at the same time offer an image of modern Britain. A classic example is The National Health, brilliantly staged by Michael Blakemore for the National Theatre in 1969 and rarely seen since. The setting is a ward in an outdated Victorian gothic hospital and Nichols uses Carry On jokes and soap-opera parody to create a microcosm of modern society. The six inmates embody everything from buoyant optimism to bilious pessimism (\u201cthis sceptr\u2019d isle with its rivers poisoned ... beaches fouled with oil ... the sea choked with excrement\u201d) while attended by a cynically jocular male nurse who argues that \u201cmost of the healing arts are bent if you want my frank opinion\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07e1b850146e704e74278fac852ef532487b12aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07e1b850146e704e74278fac852ef532487b12aa/0_0_2076_3142/661.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Williams and Dennis Quilley in the RSC production of Privates on Parade at the Aldwych, London, in 1977\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Williams and Dennis Quilley in the RSC production of Privates on Parade at the Aldwych, London, in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ashdown/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reared in the keyhole naturalism of television, Nichols was always at his best in maximising the theatricality of theatre. His mix of personal memory, popular comedy and political comment reached its apogee in his 1977 musical, Privates on Parade. The show was directly based on Nichols\u2019 own experience, as a young serviceman, with Combined Services Entertainment in the Malaysia of the early 1950s where his contemporaries included Stanley Baxter, Kenneth Williams and John Schlesinger. This resulted in the creation of the memorably camp figure of Acting (or even over-acting) Captain Terri Dennis who signed on only because \u201cthe panto season was over and life under Clementina Attlee wasn\u2019t exactly the Roman Empire\u201d. But behind the gags and songs lay a serious question about whether the British military presence in Malaysia was dictated by a desire to combat communism or commercial interests.</p> <p>Nichols enjoyed working on a big scale. In Poppy, staged by the RSC in 1982, he used the form of Christmas panto to explore the 19th-century Opium Wars. But Nichols could also create effective domestic drama. One of his most moving plays \u2013 though difficult to revive today for obvious reasons \u2013 was Chez Nous in which a middle-aged man is revealed to have had an affair with his best friend\u2019s teenage daughter. Far more durable is the 1981 Passion Play, which tackles the corrosive nature of sexual infidelity. It is part of a remarkable trinity of plays on that subject \u2013 including Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal and Tom Stoppard\u2019s The Real Thing \u2013 but what distinguishes Nichols\u2019s is his invention of alter egos for the central couple who articulate their private anxieties.</p> <p>In later years Nichols fell out of fashion and, while he continued to write, many of his new plays went sadly unproduced. But he is part of the great pantheon of postwar British dramatists and, at his best, he showed zest, flair and a unique talent for fashioning national metaphors out of his lived experience.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Nichols, who has died aged 92, once wrote an autobiography called Feeling You\u2019re Behind. The title says a lot about Nichols in that it combined a rude joke with a sense that other playwrights enjoyed a popularity he had been denied. Yet from A Day in the Death of Joe Egg in 1967 to Passion Play in 1981, Nicholas enjoyed a rich run of success in British theatre and showed a capacity to create resonant public drama out of personal experience. The obvious thing to say about Nichols is that he relentlessly mined his private life. After a clutch of TV plays in the early 1960s, he hit the big time in 1967 with Joe Egg, which is about to be revived in the West End. It was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a landmark play in that Nichols dramatised the problem faced by himself and his wife, Thelma, of how to live with a disabled child. The difficulty, as Nichols acknowledged, was that of confronting the issue \u201cin a way that will prevent a sudden stampede to the exit doors\u201d. His solution was twofold: to have the characters directly address the audience and to show that domestic pain is made bearable by caustically irreverent humour. Where other dramatists might have veered towards the maudlin or sentimental, Nichols wrote a blackly funny play in which the teacher-hero typically sees God as \u201ca sort of manic-depressive rugby footballer\u201d. While most of Nichols\u2019s plays are deeply autobiographical, they exploit popular forms and at the same time offer an image of modern Britain. A classic example is The National Health, brilliantly staged by Michael Blakemore for the National Theatre in 1969 and rarely seen since. The setting is a ward in an outdated Victorian gothic hospital and Nichols uses Carry On jokes and soap-opera parody to create a microcosm of modern society. The six inmates embody everything from buoyant optimism to bilious pessimism (\u201cthis sceptr\u2019d isle with its rivers poisoned ... beaches fouled with oil ... the sea choked with excrement\u201d) while attended by a cynically jocular male nurse who argues that \u201cmost of the healing arts are bent if you want my frank opinion\u201d. Reared in the keyhole naturalism of television, Nichols was always at his best in maximising the theatricality of theatre. His mix of personal memory, popular comedy and political comment reached its apogee in his 1977 musical, Privates on Parade. The show was directly based on Nichols\u2019 own experience, as a young serviceman, with Combined Services Entertainment in the Malaysia of the early 1950s where his contemporaries included Stanley Baxter, Kenneth Williams and John Schlesinger. This resulted in the creation of the memorably camp figure of Acting (or even over-acting) Captain Terri Dennis who signed on only because \u201cthe panto season was over and life under Clementina Attlee wasn\u2019t exactly the Roman Empire\u201d. But behind the gags and songs lay a serious question about whether the British military presence in Malaysia was dictated by a desire to combat communism or commercial interests. Nichols enjoyed working on a big scale. In Poppy, staged by the RSC in 1982, he used the form of Christmas panto to explore the 19th-century Opium Wars. But Nichols could also create effective domestic drama. One of his most moving plays \u2013 though difficult to revive today for obvious reasons \u2013 was Chez Nous in which a middle-aged man is revealed to have had an affair with his best friend\u2019s teenage daughter. Far more durable is the 1981 Passion Play, which tackles the corrosive nature of sexual infidelity. It is part of a remarkable trinity of plays on that subject \u2013 including Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal and Tom Stoppard\u2019s The Real Thing \u2013 but what distinguishes Nichols\u2019s is his invention of alter egos for the central couple who articulate their private anxieties. In later years Nichols fell out of fashion and, while he continued to write, many of his new plays went sadly unproduced. But he is part of the great pantheon of postwar British dramatists and, at his best, he showed zest, flair and a unique talent for fashioning national metaphors out of his lived experience.",

The government will move a prorogation motion at the close of parliamentary business on Monday, meaning MPs will not return to the House of Commons until 14 October. Before parliament is suspended, the Benn bill is expected to receive royal assent, which means Johnson should be forced to request an extension to the Brexit deadline until January 2020 if there is no deal agreed by 19 October. However, Downing Street is still insisting neither Johnson nor any member of his government will under any circumstances ask the EU for an extension to article 50.

Eurosceptic MPs are insisting Johnson still has options for \u201csabotaging\u201d any request for an extension, such as making it clear separately that he does not really want one.

One is that parliament\u2019s no-deal bill could be treated by the EU as an extension request, regardless of whether the government sends a letter to Brussels. EU sources have described this interpretation as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. Another myth is that Brussels could force an extension on the UK. This is also incorrect; the British government must agree to any proposed extension.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What does the EU think about delaying Brexit?</strong></h2> \n<p>The UK has already had two Brexit extensions and the EU does not relish a third. EU diplomats say an extension would be granted for \u201ca political event\u201d, meaning an election or another referendum. An extension for other reasons is less certain. The UK would be expected to make a \u201creasoned request\u201d showing the government could find a way out of the current Brexit morass. EU leaders do not want delay for the sake of a few months\u2019 more political chaos at Westminster and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/france-threatens-to-veto-further-brexit-extension\">\u201cfarcical\u201d</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/france-threatens-to-veto-further-brexit-extension\"> talks</a> in Brussels.</p> \n<h2><strong>Would France veto an extension?</strong></h2> \n<p>France\u2019s exasperation with Brexit was captured by its foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, who has said an extension beyond 31 October would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/france-threatens-to-veto-further-brexit-extension\">not be possible under current conditions</a>. Since April, more EU member states have come round to France\u2019s point of view. The Netherlands, another close UK ally, sounds equally impatient. The Dutch trade minister, Sigrid Kaag, has suggested the certainty of Brexit on 31 October <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/eu-losing-patience-britain-dutch-minister\">could be preferable to the current drift</a>. \u201cA good reason is needed for a new delay,\u201d she said, using tough language that left little room for another extension.</p> \n<p>It is hard to see the EU turning down a request for an extension drawn up by MPs intent on avoiding no deal. The EU has never wanted to be seen as pushing the UK out of the door. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/22/it-was-not-clear-if-she-had-a-plan-at-all-how-mays-night-at-the-summit-unfolded\">described the UK as a \u201cpatient\u201d</a> that needed careful treatment, seems particular conscious of the weight of history. Meanwhile Ireland, an influential voice in Brexit talks, sounds open to an extension, to avoid the calamity of a hard border.</p> \n<h2><strong>Couldn\u2019t the UK get Hungary or Poland to block an extension?</strong></h2> \n<p>This Brexiter idea is becoming almost as popular as the theory that German carmakers would demand a good deal for the UK. It is built on a similar misunderstanding of EU interests.</p> \n<p>Neither Poland nor Hungary have anything to gain from frustrating the other 26 by vetoing an extension for Boris Johnson. Both are net recipients of EU funds and have their own fights with Brussels.</p> \n<p>These countries\u2019 reluctance to spend political capital on the UK was demonstrated at one EU summit. In front of the cameras, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, kissed Theresa May\u2019s hand and told journalists he was opposed to \u201cpunishing the British\u201d. Inside the privacy of the summit chamber, when he had the chance to speak for the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/macron-puts-the-boot-in-after-mays-brexit-breakfast-blunder\">he said nothing</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How long could an extension last?</strong></h2> \n<p>The current EU mood favours a short extension, with some diplomats reported to support MPs\u2019 proposed 31 January 2020 date. But it is difficult to tell until EU leaders gather round the summit table. Before previous Brexit summits, delays of 12 and 21 months were mooted by senior officials, only to wilt under the scrutiny of EU leaders who take the decisions.</p> \n<p>One wildcard is that the current EU leaders, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, are heading for the exits. Both have argued for longer extensions to allow the British time to resolve the crisis and prevent the EU from being bogged down by Brexit. Ursula von der Leyen, who takes over from Juncker as head of the European commission, is likely to be at the October summit. She has signalled she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/ursula-von-der-leyen-no-deal-brexit-would-be-massive-blow-for-both-sides\">open to an extension for \u201cgood reasons\u201d</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>Would the EU attach conditions?</strong></h2> \n<p>Any extension would come with a familiar set of terms and conditions. The UK would have to pledge \u201csincere cooperation\u201d, meaning it would not disrupt EU business. The previous extension agreement also included an often-forgotten clause that there would be \u201cno reopening of the withdrawal agreement\u201d.</p>",

This is also incorrect; the British government must agree to any proposed extension. What does the EU think about delaying Brexit? The UK has already had two Brexit extensions and the EU does not relish a third. EU diplomats say an extension would be granted for \u201ca political event\u201d, meaning an election or another referendum. An extension for other reasons is less certain. The UK would be expected to make a \u201creasoned request\u201d showing the government could find a way out of the current Brexit morass. EU leaders do not want delay for the sake of a few months\u2019 more political chaos at Westminster and \u201cfarcical\u201d talks in Brussels. Would France veto an extension? France\u2019s exasperation with Brexit was captured by its foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, who has said an extension beyond 31 October would not be possible under current conditions. Since April, more EU member states have come round to France\u2019s point of view. The Netherlands, another close UK ally, sounds equally impatient. The Dutch trade minister, Sigrid Kaag, has suggested the certainty of Brexit on 31 October could be preferable to the current drift. \u201cA good reason is needed for a new delay,\u201d she said, using tough language that left little room for another extension. It is hard to see the EU turning down a request for an extension drawn up by MPs intent on avoiding no deal. The EU has never wanted to be seen as pushing the UK out of the door. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who once described the UK as a \u201cpatient\u201d that needed careful treatment, seems particular conscious of the weight of history. Meanwhile Ireland, an influential voice in Brexit talks, sounds open to an extension, to avoid the calamity of a hard border. Couldn\u2019t the UK get Hungary or Poland to block an extension? This Brexiter idea is becoming almost as popular as the theory that German carmakers would demand a good deal for the UK. It is built on a similar misunderstanding of EU interests. Neither Poland nor Hungary have anything to gain from frustrating the other 26 by vetoing an extension for Boris Johnson. Both are net recipients of EU funds and have their own fights with Brussels. These countries\u2019 reluctance to spend political capital on the UK was demonstrated at one EU summit. In front of the cameras, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, kissed Theresa May\u2019s hand and told journalists he was opposed to \u201cpunishing the British\u201d. Inside the privacy of the summit chamber, when he had the chance to speak for the UK, he said nothing. How long could an extension last? The current EU mood favours a short extension, with some diplomats reported to support MPs\u2019 proposed 31 January 2020 date. But it is difficult to tell until EU leaders gather round the summit table. Before previous Brexit summits, delays of 12 and 21 months were mooted by senior officials, only to wilt under the scrutiny of EU leaders who take the decisions. One wildcard is that the current EU leaders, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, are heading for the exits. Both have argued for longer extensions to allow the British time to resolve the crisis and prevent the EU from being bogged down by Brexit. Ursula von der Leyen, who takes over from Juncker as head of the European commission, is likely to be at the October summit. She has signalled she is open to an extension for \u201cgood reasons\u201d. Would the EU attach conditions? Any extension would come with a familiar set of terms and conditions. The UK would have to pledge \u201csincere cooperation\u201d, meaning it would not disrupt EU business. The previous extension agreement also included an often-forgotten clause that there would be \u201cno reopening of the withdrawal agreement\u201d.",

Citing police sources, newspaper Tagesspiegel reported on Monday the man may have had an epileptic seizure. A 67-year-old woman and a six-year-old child were also travelling in the Porsche Macan.

Carmena smiles. \u201cJames said: \u2018We could probably just get married.\u2019 I said: \u2018Oh yeah, cool.\u2019 We were very cool about it but then I hung up and I started going: \u2018Oh my God, he asked me to marry him.\u2019 I was running round the house, like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201d She flew to Los Angeles and, six months after they met, they got married at San Francisco city hall. \u201cWe kind of got married without really knowing each other,\u201d says Carmena. \u201cOver time we\u2019ve gotten to know each other pretty well.\u201d Their families also had to make some adjustments. \u201cIt caused a bit of a ruckus because my mother thought the [17-year] age difference was too great \u2013 she was thinking of Princess Di and Prince Charles and how their marriage was doomed because he was so much older,\u201d says Carmena. \u201cAnd James\u2019s family had a few reservations about it as well.\u201d James says: \u201cWe won both families over.\u201d They lived in Los Angeles for 12 years, then moved to Carmena\u2019s hometown in Marlborough in New Zealand. Neither had been looking for a partner when they met. \u201cIt was a total surprise,\u201d says Carmena. \u201cI had just come out of a really dysfunctional relationship, which reaffirmed all the reasons why I didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship. Even when I met the psychic, I was like: \u2018Oh yeah, right.\u2019 I totally brushed it off and I didn\u2019t even remember her words until I saw James.\u201d What did James think when she told him, shortly after their wedding, about the prediction? He laughs. \u201cI\u2019d been around a lot of yoga people, so I just kind of went with it.\u201d Want to share your story?

As one senior EU negotiator puts it: \u201cThe backstop means no border on the island of Ireland. But the UK\u2019s solution will result in a customs and regulatory border \u2013 which will carry implications for peace.\u201d This is obviously unacceptable for the EU27. The government also wants to bank the benefits of Brexit by diverging from EU rules to the maximum extent possible. Yet this has fostered the perception in EU capitals that the UK will compete with its firms by undercutting EU standards. Politically, it makes little strategic sense for the EU to compromise on the backstop \u2013 and risk its principles \u2013 if the purpose of doing so is to facilitate a deal over a bare-bones free trade agreement (FTA) that would not differ much from a no-deal outcome. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between no deal and a hard FTA?\u201d ponders another adviser to an EU head of state. In no deal, the EU would at least have stuck to its principles. Once the EU factors in Johnson\u2019s tumultuous week in parliament \u2013 that has left him heading an even weaker minority government and facing the high likelihood of an early election \u2013 it\u2019s possible to see why its calculus is shifting it again towards a harder, less flexible position. As the UK slides painfully towards an early election, there is less scope for progress in Brussels. Any formal UK proposals will become political fodder. The EU will have to become more cautious in its response; it will not risk its interventions becoming part of the campaign. As the EU ponders events in London, its window for a deal, while open, is closing. \u2022 Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director of Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm",

      "body": "<p>The playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/peternichols\">Peter Nichols</a>, who was best known for his anarchic, acerbic and semi-autobiographical black comedies, has died at the age of 92. His agent, Alan Brodie, confirmed that Nichols died on Saturday in Oxford.</p> <p>Nichols had a hit in 1967 with A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, about a married couple raising their daughter who is severely disabled. The play debuted at the Citizens theatre in Glasgow then transferred to the West End in London and to Broadway, where it was nominated for four Tony awards. For this ground-breaking drama about disability, Nichols drew upon the early years of his marriage and the life of his eldest daughter, Abigail. \u201cShe went into hospital at four and stayed there till she died,\u201d Nichols said, describing her life as \u201ca sort of living death\u201d. The play was adapted for a 1972 film, has had several high-profile revivals and returns to the West End this month in a new production at the Trafalgar Studios in London, directed by Simon Evans and starring Toby Stephens, Claire Skinner and Patricia Hodge.</p> <p>Nichols was born on 31 July 1927 and grew up in Bristol where he studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school. He would later play roles including Dracula, and have a stint as a teacher, before focusing on writing. Nichols did his national service with the RAF and was a wartime entertainer alongside Kenneth Williams with the Combined Services Entertainment unit in Singapore, putting on revues and sketches. That experience inspired his 1977 tragi-farcical musical Privates on Parade, which was first staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company and later became a film starring John Cleese.

      "bodyText": "The playwright Peter Nichols, who was best known for his anarchic, acerbic and semi-autobiographical black comedies, has died at the age of 92. His agent, Alan Brodie, confirmed that Nichols died on Saturday in Oxford. Nichols had a hit in 1967 with A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, about a married couple raising their daughter who is severely disabled. The play debuted at the Citizens theatre in Glasgow then transferred to the West End in London and to Broadway, where it was nominated for four Tony awards. For this ground-breaking drama about disability, Nichols drew upon the early years of his marriage and the life of his eldest daughter, Abigail. \u201cShe went into hospital at four and stayed there till she died,\u201d Nichols said, describing her life as \u201ca sort of living death\u201d. The play was adapted for a 1972 film, has had several high-profile revivals and returns to the West End this month in a new production at the Trafalgar Studios in London, directed by Simon Evans and starring Toby Stephens, Claire Skinner and Patricia Hodge. Nichols was born on 31 July 1927 and grew up in Bristol where he studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school. He would later play roles including Dracula, and have a stint as a teacher, before focusing on writing. Nichols did his national service with the RAF and was a wartime entertainer alongside Kenneth Williams with the Combined Services Entertainment unit in Singapore, putting on revues and sketches. That experience inspired his 1977 tragi-farcical musical Privates on Parade, which was first staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company and later became a film starring John Cleese. The traditions of music hall and vaudeville remained an influence throughout his career. The RSC also put on his Passion Play, about infidelity, in 1980 and the musical Poppy, about the 19th-century opium wars, in 1982. His other plays included The National Health, a satire of hospital politics; So Long Life, which he sardonically deemed \u201csub-Chekhov\u201d; and Lingua Franca, which drew upon his own experiences of teaching English as a foreign language. As well as screen adaptations of his plays, Nichols wrote the film Having a Wild Weekend, starring the Dave Clark Five, and co-wrote the 1966 swinging London film Georgy Girl. There were also novels, short stories, hugely entertaining memoirs and a number of unproduced plays. He increasingly felt he had become an outsider, his plays underperformed. In a 2001 diary for the Observer he noted: \u201cReview in Oxford paper of A Day in the Life of Joe Egg. Serves me right. We can expect someone soon to be talking about Pirates on Parade.\u201d Six years later he told the Guardian: \u201cThey\u2019re not doing my plays very much any more and that\u2019s been a source of great misery.\u201d However, to mark his 80th birthday, his play Forget-Me-Not-Lane was revived by the Stephen Joseph theatre in Scarborough and the Orange Tree in Richmond, while Privates on Parade was staged at the West Yorkshire Playhouse and Birmingham Rep.

      "bodyText": "Pro-Kremlin candidates have suffered losses in local elections in Moscow as Vladimir Putin\u2019s biggest critic hailed the success of his campaign to encourage strategic voting. The election was closely watched by both sides following a summer of protests in the Russian capital against the Kremlin\u2019s refusal to allow candidates allied with opposition leader Alexei Navalny on to the ballot. According to Russian media reports the Kremlin banned opposition candidates after internal polling indicated they would win at least nine seats. While the city council has few powers, analysts say the Kremlin was reluctant to allow Navalny\u2019s allies a foothold on the electoral ladder ahead of far more significant parliamentary polls due in 2021. Navalny, 43, portrayed the city council elections as a referendum on Putin and the United Russia party that backs the president. He appealed to voters to cast their ballots for United Russia\u2019s strongest challengers, even if they represented political parties that they would not normally vote for, such as the Communists. Although United Russia retained its majority in Moscow after Sunday\u2019s vote, its share of seats on the 45-seat city council was slashed from 40 to 25. The Communist party took 13 seats, up from five last time, while the A Just Russia party won three seats. Both parties are widely seen as part of the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cloyal opposition\u201d.

Beth is a social worker whose ancestors were all slaves and who falls headily in love with Opal, a mixed-race woman of uncertain parentage. Beth, meanwhile, is a friend of Aisha, an Asian carpenter, who in turn is a chum of Yomi, a single mum of Nigerian origin. Kay explores the dilemmas faced by each of the women through speech, song and their respective attachments to inanimate objects including a photo-album, a mirror, a cushion and a doll. But while Kay highlights moments such as Beth\u2019s recollected schoolgirl sense of sexual isolation, the piece is stubbornly undramatic. Only when Aisha hosts a disastrous dinner party, where the homophobic Yomi attacks her lesbian fellow guests, does the play acquire a palpable tension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe80996f6525a357a24212f4b4164baaf1a786df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe80996f6525a357a24212f4b4164baaf1a786df/76_301_3516_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toying with memory \u2026 Gloria Onitri as Yomi in Chiaroscuro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toying with memory \u2026 Gloria Onitri as Yomi in Chiaroscuro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The piece is perfectly well performed. Shiloh Coke, who composed the pleasantly melancholic music, invests Beth with a late-flowering confidence in her sexual persona, while Anoushka Lucas as Opal sings sweetly and poignantly suggests a woman in search of a fixed identity.

      "bodyText": "The Bush, which has recently revived Winsome Pinnock\u2019s Leave Taking and Caryl Phillips\u2019s Strange Fruit, has an excellent record for rescuing key plays from neglect. Lynette Linton, in her debut production as the theatre\u2019s artistic director, brings us a 1986 piece from Jackie Kay which, for all its verbal grace, strikes me as a meandering meditation on sexual identity hardly crying out for revival. Staged as a piece of gig theatre with the actors playing their own instruments, the show deals with four women of colour from diverse backgrounds. Beth is a social worker whose ancestors were all slaves and who falls headily in love with Opal, a mixed-race woman of uncertain parentage. Beth, meanwhile, is a friend of Aisha, an Asian carpenter, who in turn is a chum of Yomi, a single mum of Nigerian origin. Kay explores the dilemmas faced by each of the women through speech, song and their respective attachments to inanimate objects including a photo-album, a mirror, a cushion and a doll. But while Kay highlights moments such as Beth\u2019s recollected schoolgirl sense of sexual isolation, the piece is stubbornly undramatic. Only when Aisha hosts a disastrous dinner party, where the homophobic Yomi attacks her lesbian fellow guests, does the play acquire a palpable tension. The piece is perfectly well performed. Shiloh Coke, who composed the pleasantly melancholic music, invests Beth with a late-flowering confidence in her sexual persona, while Anoushka Lucas as Opal sings sweetly and poignantly suggests a woman in search of a fixed identity. Preeya Kalidas brings out Aisha\u2019s keen work ethic, even if her friendship with Gloria Onitri\u2019s Yomi, with her antediluvian attitudes on race and sex, seems improbable. But I feel that Kay \u2013 who has Opal say at one point, \u201cWhen I first met Beth I was swimming in purple oceans, dancing on dangerous waters\u201d \u2013 is more concerned with language than action. While chiaroscuro, signifying the interplay of light and shade in visual art, is a haunting word, it is also one of questionable relevance to the more definite demands of drama.

Tunisia, the only democracy to emerge from the 2011 Arab spring, is to test its fledgling political system with a presidential election on 15 September, following the death in July of the country\u2019s unifying secular president, Beji Caid Essebsi. Vikram, the lander from India\u2019s first moon mission, has been found on the lunar surface a day after losing contact, during what one official from the Indian Space Research Organisation said \u201cmust have been a hard landing\u201d. Must-reads Amazon still ablaze as Brazil dismisses fire \u2018fuss\u2019 Tom Phillips travelled almost 1,250 miles (2,000km) by road and river through Rond\u00f4nia and Amazonas, two of the Brazilian states most affected by widespread and severe Amazon rainforest fires. What he saw gives the lie to the Bolsonaro regime\u2019s claim that the situation is under control. Meet the woman tipped to lead the US labor movement Sara Nelson, the leader of the Association of Flight Attendants union, is a fast-rising star in the US labor movement, tipped for its very top job: president of the AFL-CIO. The movement doesn\u2019t need rebuilding, she tells Lauren Gambino. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that has to be put into fourth gear and supercharged.\u201d How testosterone replacement can change men\u2019s lives Men who feel tired or drained are often told it\u2019s just a fact of life, part of the process of ageing. But for some the problem is unusually low testosterone \u2013 which is easily treated, but not routinely diagnosed, as Amelia Hill reports. Why are women joining the NoFap movement? The NoFap community was founded in 2011 after a web developer decided to \u201creboot\u201d his brain by giving up masturbation, inspired by a small study claiming abstention raised male testosterone levels. Yet around 5% of its adherents are female. Katie Bishops asks what makes women join such a male-dominated movement. Opinion Last week, states including Texas and New York launched antitrust investigations into Google and Facebook, the first American effort to decentralise Big Tech\u2019s grip on information. It\u2019s a welcome development for democracy and the free press, says Matt Stoller. These corporations have become too powerful to be contained by democratic societies. We must work through our government to break them up and regulate our information commons, or they will end up becoming our government and choosing what we see and know about the world around us. Sport The New England Patriots laid down a marker for the new NFL season on Sunday night as the Super Bowl champions crushed the Pittsburgh Steelers 33-3. Meanwhile, Lamar Jackson threw five touchdown passes to help the Baltimore Ravens humiliate the Miami Dolphins \u2013 his hometown team \u2013 59-10. The reigning Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has complained of a lack of consistency in penalty decision-making after suggesting the winner of this weekend\u2019s Italian Grand Prix, Charles Leclerc, had not obeyed the rules. Hamilton came third in the race but remains top of the 2019 table. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

      "bodyText": "Australians rorting a scheme designed to allow travellers to claim back the goods and services tax have cost the budget up to $557m over 20 years, according to the audit office. In a scathing audit report released on Monday, the home affairs department and tax office were blamed for failing to undertake risk assessments and implementing only \u201climited systems\u201d to prevent revenue leakage. Both government agencies conceded that the tourist refund scheme (TRS) \u2013 which gives travellers refunds for GST and wine equalisation tax \u2013 is a \u201clow priority\u201d, with the ATO even suggesting it may not be practical to enforce. According to data estimates provided by home affairs, the scheme suffered \u201ca large level of non-compliance from Australian citizens and residents and significant revenue leakage\u201d of between $244m and $557m since July 2000. While around 60% of countries have schemes that provide sales tax refunds to tourists, the ATO believes Australia is the only country that allows its own citizens and residents to participate in the scheme \u2013 opening the system to abuse from those who claim they are taking goods out of the country but then bring them back after international travel. The audit office found that IT systems used to identify non-compliant or fraudulent claims had not improved \u201cin any meaningful respect\u201d since the scheme\u2019s introduction almost 20 years ago. \u201cHome Affairs and the ATO have not used the available TRS data to implement systematic and routine compliance approaches to assist in detecting patterns and indicators of revenue leakage,\u201d it said. \u201cDetections of significant instances of fraud have been ad hoc rather than as a result of systematic data analysis.\u201d The audit office found that the home affairs department used its power to place alerts on returning Australian citizens and residents where it suspected that goods may be reimported without being declared \u201crelatively infrequently\u201d, despite a hit rate of 41.9% where such red flags were placed on a traveller. The department also stopped issuing penalties for undeclared importation of TRS-claimed goods between 2013 and 2018, issuing them \u201cinfrequently\u201d since then. In 2012 an enforcement exercise found that 36% of returned Australians who had made a claim were non-compliant, a figure that would suggest a loss of $244m of GST revenue that would otherwise be paid to the states. In 2015 the department suggested a more recent audit put the rate at 50% non-compliance, while documents from 2018 suggested in a 2014 audit the rate was 82%, which implies revenue of $557m was lost since the scheme\u2019s introduction in 2000. However, the audit report said the department and ATO were \u201cunable to locate data sources for the two more recent estimates of non-compliance\u201d. The ATO responded that the audit office had \u201crelied on unverified Department of Home Affairs\u2019 non-compliance rates to calculate revenue leakage. \u201cWe also observe that it would appear to be impractical to enforce the TRS at airports to reduce the ANAO\u2019s currently stated revenue leakage. \u201cWhilst this is a matter for the Department of Home Affairs to consider, the ATO believes that any compliance strategy under the current TRS framework will have a negative impact on international passenger experience.\u201d The home affairs department responded that it considers the TRS of \u201crelatively low risk and operational priority compared with our other responsibilities such as national security, border protection and immigration policy\u201d. It blamed the funding of enforcement which it said had \u201cnot kept pace with the escalating number of claims made each year. We raised this on a number of occasions over the past five years noting that the number of TRS claims has almost doubled whilst the funding provided by the [ATO] has slightly fallen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A mystery sickness has struck dozens of dogs in Norway, killing at least 25 and prompting authorities to warn owners to keep their pets on a lead and away from other canines until the cause is established. Ten dogs fell ill on Saturday and Sunday, the national food safety authority said, four of which have since died. While most cases have been in the capital, Oslo, the illness has been reported in 14 of the country\u2019s 18 counties, including the far north. According to the Swedish newspaper GT, a dog in neighbouring Sweden was also being treated in a veterinary hospital after appearing at a show in the Norwegian city of Trondheim last week.

Until then, I\u2019d appreciated the poetry criticism written by Stephanie Burt (who also writes as Stephen Burt), but never read any of the poetry. Catching up has been a great pleasure, and I\u2019d warmly recommend Stephanie Burt\u2019s 2017 collection, <a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/advice-lights\">Advice from the Lights</a>, a rare combination of formal inventiveness, youthful pep and mature reflective wisdom.</p> <p>Wildflower Meadow, Medawisla, more recently written, is a different kind of poem, less discursive and more obliquely human-focused. The nine stanzas are interlocked but, being closely-cropped tercets, they superficially resemble haiku, and contain something of that form\u2019s attentive focus.</p> <p>Right away, the flowers are transformed by metaphor (as wouldn\u2019t happen in a haiku), re-shaped as imaginary boats. The \u201cmany- / oared asters\u201d in <a href=\"http://www.naturenorth.com/fall/asters/Faters.html\">their roundedness</a> become <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/mikecatwalters/coracle-pics/\">coracles</a> and the long slender <a href=\"https://garden.org/plants/photo/153483/\">goldenrod seed-pods</a>, triremes. These flower-boats are about to set out on mysterious voyages. They have no co-operative intention towards us human observers, however much we may admire and want to conserve them.</p> <p>The \u201cMedawisla\u201d of the title locates the wildflower meadow in an eponymous centre belonging to <a href=\"https://www.outdoors.org/about/mission\">the Appalachian Mountain Club</a>.

      "bodyText": "Wildflower Meadow, Medawisla The many- oared asters are coracles; the goldenrod pods, triremes. They do not plan their voyages to please us. The tangle of brambles and drupes shifts only slightly when the wind attempts to part the knee- or waist-high stalks and thorns. What will you do or be in that state you fear and look forward to, when none of them needs us, after the last seeds leave? I was browsing back issues of the Harvard Review over the summer, when this poem attracted my eye. Until then, I\u2019d appreciated the poetry criticism written by Stephanie Burt (who also writes as Stephen Burt), but never read any of the poetry. Catching up has been a great pleasure, and I\u2019d warmly recommend Stephanie Burt\u2019s 2017 collection, Advice from the Lights, a rare combination of formal inventiveness, youthful pep and mature reflective wisdom. Wildflower Meadow, Medawisla, more recently written, is a different kind of poem, less discursive and more obliquely human-focused. The nine stanzas are interlocked but, being closely-cropped tercets, they superficially resemble haiku, and contain something of that form\u2019s attentive focus. Right away, the flowers are transformed by metaphor (as wouldn\u2019t happen in a haiku), re-shaped as imaginary boats. The \u201cmany- / oared asters\u201d in their roundedness become coracles and the long slender goldenrod seed-pods, triremes. These flower-boats are about to set out on mysterious voyages. They have no co-operative intention towards us human observers, however much we may admire and want to conserve them. The \u201cMedawisla\u201d of the title locates the wildflower meadow in an eponymous centre belonging to the Appalachian Mountain Club. The word means \u201cloon\u201d in the Abenaki language. I used to think the loon was an exotic US species that didn\u2019t occur in the UK, but apparently the bird is quite common: it\u2019s known as the Great Northern Diver, which may be one reason so few Brits write poems about it. (Here\u2019s a lovely \u201cloon poem\u201d by another American, Mary Oliver). The Abenaki word is complex, orchestral. Summoned in the poem\u2019s title, it echoes \u201cmeadow\u201d and, more faintly, \u201cwildflower\u201d, and, once we know its meaning, enhances the connection of the seeding flowers with flight. Burt\u2019s poem proceeds to evoke a tough, recalcitrant meadow, defying the wind with its \u201cstalks / and thorns\u201d. Line and stanza breaks are placed so as to optimise the braced rhythms and sturdy textures. The last line of the sixth stanza splits, and introduces the question that will thread its way to the end of the poem. Again, human unimportance is signalled. \u201cWhat will // you do or / be in that state / you fear and look // forward to\u201d? The question is especially interesting because of the ambivalence regarding \u201cthat state\u201d. Can it really be the case that we humans might look forward to the flowerless time \u201cwhen none of / them needs // us, after / the last/ seeds leave\u201d. This could simply be an autumn poem.

      "bodyText": "Indonesian police are investigating allegations of masked motorcycle riders throwing bags of snakes into a West Papuan student dormitory in Surabaya and \u201cdeliberately spreading terror\u201d. The hostel was the site of anti-Papua protests last month, which then sparked rolling and often violent protests across Indonesia, including in the Papuan province. Students at the East Java accommodation, which was the target of racist taunts and protests last month, said shortly after 4am Monday four people on two motorcycles pulled up outside the building. They threw an open sack containing a 15-20kg python, and another containing three \u201caggressive\u201d snakes which escaped into the compound, student Yohanes Giyai told the Guardian. \u201cWe could not catch three aggressive snakes because they were moving towards the gutter in the dormitory, while the snake in the plastic bag [we] managed to catch it because the snake had not come out of the bag,\u201d Giyai said. Videos sent to the Guardian, purporting to be of the incident, show a large python curled inside an open sack. Giyai, an organiser for the Papuan Student Alliance Central Committee, said the motorcyclists fled as students hurried out of their rooms. He said a group of people they suspected to be Indonesian authorities were watching the building through binoculars, and were \u201crunning around\u201d. An East Java police spokesperson, Frans Barung Mangera, told the Guardian the police were investigating the incident to determine who was \u201cdeliberately spreading terror\u201d and confirmed the dormitory was being guarded by police. It was not clear if police were guarding the building when the motorcyclists came by. Students have told the Guardian they feel the police presence is a form of intimidation. It is not the first time snakes have been used to intimidate West Papuans. In February a UN panel of experts called for investigations into violence, unlawful arrest and mistreatment, after video emerged of police using a large snake to terrorise a handcuffed Papuan teenage boy. News of the dawn intimidation comes days after reports emerged that an Indonesian student activist, Surya Anta, was being detained in an isolated cell at the Mako Brimob detention centre where nationalist songs, including the national anthem, were played throughout the day. The pro-Papuan activist was arrested with seven Papuan students for allegedly raising the Morning Star flag, a symbol of Papuan independence, at a protest in front of the state palace in Jakarta. Police say they are now facing charges of treason. In recent days activists have also claimed that security forces in the Papuan capital of Jayapura have conducted nightly raids on student dormitories, leaving students frightened and traumatised, while other Papuan students have complained of being subject to heavy surveillance and intimidation by authorities. At least six people are believed to have been killed and dozens arrested in clashes between protesters and police in Papuan towns in recent weeks. Indonesian authorities deployed extra police and military personnel into the region, and shut down internet, as demonstrations turned violent. A number of students were reportedly shot by militia groups, and footage of soldiers firing on protesters emerged last month. Footage of protests seen by the Guardian also appeared to show pro-Indonesian militia marching, carrying Indonesian flags and weapons. Indonesian military personnel are seen in some clips, walking among the militia. Much of the information from the Papua protests has come through the Indonesian human rights lawyer Veronica Koman, who Indonesian authorities have since named as a \u201csuspect\u201d in the spreading of \u201cfake news\u201d. On Saturday East Java police said they had issued a warrant for Koman. The chief of the East Java regional police Insp Gen Luki Hermawan, told Antara news police had visited her family\u2019s house, and were working with state intelligence, government ministries and the immigration department. Police have cited Koman\u2019s posts about an August incident in Surabaya when military and nationalist militia were captured on video calling Papuan students \u201cmonkeys\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d. She faces up to six years jail if found guilty on charges under the country\u2019s controversial electronic information and transactions law.",

Erasing that concept was one of the great achievements of the new law.</p> <p>In Iceland the women\u2019s rights movement as a whole has been wholly supportive of trans rights for decades. All major feminist and human rights organisations declared their support for the law, and hailed it as an important step in reaching true equality in Iceland. For them, it was obvious. And for trans people like me, it offered a sense of hope for the future \u2013 a future where we can all work together to make the lives of those <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-study-reveals-shocking-rates-of-attempted-suicide-among-trans-adolescen\">most in danger</a> more positive.<br><br>\u00deorbj\u00f6rg \u00deorvaldsd\u00f3ttir, the chair of Samt\u00f6kin \u201978 \u2013 the national LGBTI organisation of Iceland \u2013 reflected on just how important this legislation was from a feminist perspective. \u201cThis is obviously a great step forward for LGBTQ+ rights, but the new law is also an important feminist milestone. Transphobia \u2013 as well as prejudice against LGBTQ+ people in general \u2013 is deeply rooted in outdated gender norms and misogyny. The passing of this legislation sends an affirmative message to society that every individual should be able to define and live their gender as they please without prejudice. I believe that this will benefit everyone, cis people and trans people alike.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/19/its-the-moral-panic-de-rigueur-but-they-cant-make-me-feel-bad-about-being-trans\">It\u2019s the moral panic of the day \u2013 but they can\u2019t make me feel bad about being trans | Allison Gallagher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This certainly rings true with the experiences of trans women, who face everyday misogyny and abuse, on top of relentless transphobia.

But if you\u2019re not trans, I don\u2019t blame you for tuning out of the debate. I wish I could. With the climate crisis and Brexit looming, it\u2019s just another thing that makes me feel anxious and unsafe.</p> <p>But if the UK truly wants to create a safe and just society, it needs to move away from limiting the freedoms of minority groups based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/24/how-children-became-the-target-in-a-rightwing-culture-war-over-gender\">false narratives</a> or for <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/09/03/number-10-accused-weaponise-transgender-rights-upcoming-election/\">political gain</a>. It needs to build a strong human rights movement that fights for the liberation of everyone, because none of us are free until we are all free.

And for trans people like me, it offered a sense of hope for the future \u2013 a future where we can all work together to make the lives of those most in danger more positive. \u00deorbj\u00f6rg \u00deorvaldsd\u00f3ttir, the chair of Samt\u00f6kin \u201978 \u2013 the national LGBTI organisation of Iceland \u2013 reflected on just how important this legislation was from a feminist perspective. \u201cThis is obviously a great step forward for LGBTQ+ rights, but the new law is also an important feminist milestone. Transphobia \u2013 as well as prejudice against LGBTQ+ people in general \u2013 is deeply rooted in outdated gender norms and misogyny. The passing of this legislation sends an affirmative message to society that every individual should be able to define and live their gender as they please without prejudice. I believe that this will benefit everyone, cis people and trans people alike.\u201d This certainly rings true with the experiences of trans women, who face everyday misogyny and abuse, on top of relentless transphobia. Official numbers show that 26% of women in the UK experience domestic violence, with supporting numbers showing that trans women are at heightened risk. Recent reports in the UK show an 81% increase in recorded hate crime towards transgender people. It\u2019s obvious that this bitter culture war over trans rights in the UK hasn\u2019t helped anyone \u2013 whether cis or trans \u2013 and it certainly doesn\u2019t make anyone safer. But if you\u2019re not trans, I don\u2019t blame you for tuning out of the debate. I wish I could. With the climate crisis and Brexit looming, it\u2019s just another thing that makes me feel anxious and unsafe. But if the UK truly wants to create a safe and just society, it needs to move away from limiting the freedoms of minority groups based on false narratives or for political gain. It needs to build a strong human rights movement that fights for the liberation of everyone, because none of us are free until we are all free. In the words of Finnbogad\u00f3ttir: \u201cIf you think of it that way, it\u2019s freedom. Everybody wants freedom.\u201d \u2022 Owl Fisher is a writer, filmmaker and campaigner.

To put it simply, they use their control of the flow of information to monopolize advertising revenue, killing newspapers across the country and around the world and eliminating potential competitors in a host of areas. Since 2007, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/30/newsroom-employment-dropped-nearly-a-quarter-in-less-than-10-years-with-greatest-decline-at-newspapers\">a little less than half of all newspaper</a> journalism jobs in the US have been eliminated.

But advertising is nonetheless critical to give the press a viable financial lifeline, and one shielded by the state. Advertising has financed our news gathering since the early 1800s, and it is unlikely we can have a democracy without the journalism advertising enables. Facebook\u2019s global revenue will be over $60bn this year, and Google\u2019s will be more than $110bn. Most of this money used to be directed to publishers. So how do Google and Facebook control ad revenue?</p> <p>Facebook and Google are basically advertising backends tied to large consumer-facing products. Google has eight products with more than a billion users, and Facebook has four products with more than a billion users. Their business models are quite complex, but the gist is that they seek to place ads in front of you while you are trying to communicate or when you are looking for something you want. So far, this doesn\u2019t sound so bad. But Google and Facebook aren\u2019t just getting a lot of online ad revenue growth, they are capturing practically all of it. And this is where data comes in.</p> <p>The most important input for an advertiser is knowing who is watching the ad.

Google and Facebook need publishers to serve their large audiences, and publishers need Google and Facebook as distributors. But the power imbalance is stark. Google and Facebook need publishers, but they don\u2019t need any one specific publisher. By contrast every publisher desperately needs both Google and Facebook to get their content in front of readers. For example, a few years ago Google decided to punish the Wall Street Journal for enacting a certain type of paywall by downgrading the newspaper\u2019s search ranking, lowering the Wall Street Journal\u2019s traffic by 44%. Google\u2019s business was unaffected.</p> <p>With this imbalance, both Google and Facebook can and do entice or force, through a host of arrangements, millions of publishers to hand over data about their audiences and subject themselves to specific formatting choices. In other words, Google and Facebook both compete with publishers for ad revenue and force those publishers to hand over data about their readers and subscribers, data which is the main input that advertisers want.</p> <p>The net effect of this market structure is that news gatherers can produce news, but most of the advertising revenue earned from people consuming that news goes to Google and Facebook. Google and Facebook earn money from other people\u2019s work, which is unfair and anti-competitive.

Tanking is losing games on purpose; they\u2019re just positioning themselves to be in pole position for the first overall pick throughout this season and next. The fact that their plan is the definition of a tank-job does not appear to pierce the minds of the team\u2019s, umm, brain-trust.</p> <p>Miami telegraphed their intentions when they traded away Laremy Tunsil, a top-five left tackle, and Kenny Stills, a respected veteran wide receiver.

But watching your team get curb stomped for 24 months is not (the Associated Press reported that the Dolphins\u2019 stadium was half empty on Sunday). And here\u2019s the other thing: it\u2019s hard. This isn\u2019t basketball. Football prospects are no sure thing \u2013 there\u2019s much less variance in the NBA.

The players\u2019 future income will be tied to whatever they put on tape during this season. Their current income will be tied to team performance and gameday bonuses. Multiple players have already been in contact with their agents in order to get trade wheels in motion, according to the report.</p> <p>We must admire the irony of a player clamoring to get away from a team that was specifically built to lose. <em>We don\u2019t want to be on this team that\u2019s intentionally losing. </em>But they\u2019re on the team precisely because management thinks they stink. Only three players hold any kind of league-wide value: 2018 first-round pick Minkah Fitzpatrick; Xavien Howard an All-Pro caliber cornerback; and 2019 first-round pick Christian Wilkins.</p> <p>Miami stripped their roster to the bones in the offseason, punted on free agency, then cheaped out on a rotating morass of creaking mediocrity.

      "bodyText": "Sampa the Great was terrified before she stepped on stage to play her first ever show in Africa earlier this year. The show was in the Zambian capital of Lusaka \u2013 and the artist, MC and poet\u2019s cousins were in the front row. \u201cI\u2019m based in Australia and all the monumental moments in my career have happened there,\u201d says Sampa (born Sampa Tembo). \u201cBut I\u2019m from Zambia. My fear was that they wouldn\u2019t get it \u2013 and their opinion matters most.\u201d She sums up her concerns: \u201cA person coming out of Africa and playing globally while still being themselves and pushing for their own culture \u2013 to go home and not be understood.\u201d Fortunately, the shows went well. \u201cThey sang back to me \u2013 it was amazing.\u201d But Sampa\u2019s anxieties weren\u2019t unfounded. Raised between Zambia and Botswana, she left for California at 19. A few years later, in 2013, she moved to Sydney to study music production and met like minds at weekly hip-hop and jazz sessions. Her second release, Birds and the BEE9 (2017), won the Australian music prize \u2013 a $30,000 cash award modelled on the Mercury prize \u2013 and she\u2019s since supported Lauryn Hill and Kendrick Lamar, and played Glastonbury and the lauded Tasmanian experimental festival, Dark Mofo. All the while, she was craving home \u2013 Zambia. \u201cIt was affecting my joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I went home and they were like, \u2018You\u2019re different.\u2019 People can hear the change, the displacement, in the way I speak [Bantu language] Bemba. It shook my core. I became the diaspora, which was a perspective I had sympathised with but didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have myself. I didn\u2019t expect to be the displaced one.\u201d The Return, her new album out this month, delves deep into themes of home, heritage, displacement and freedom.

      "bodyText": "Jacqui Lambie has said she sees no case for the Coalition\u2019s religious discrimination bill as Tasmanians already enjoy religious freedom and don\u2019t want their discrimination laws changed. The key crossbench senator indicated her opposition to the draft bill on Monday, rejecting a contention of the attorney general, Christian Porter, that the bill does not override Tasmania\u2019s laws. While Labor is yet to determine its position, Lambie\u2019s opposition creates difficulty for the Morrison government, which would need One Nation and Centre Alliance to pass the bill if the opposition rejected it. Tasmania already has laws prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religious beliefs, affiliation or activity \u2013 which are not currently protected under federal law. Tasmanian law also prohibits statements that \u201coffend, insult or humiliate\u201d based on protected grounds including gender, race, age, sexual orientation, disability and relationship status, a provision that would not apply to religious speech if the Coalition\u2019s draft bill is passed. Lambie said that she knows \u201cthe religious freedoms [laws] we have in Tasmania, as they are now, they are working pretty well\u201d. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a lot of people around Tasmania talking to me about religious freedom,\u201d she told ABC TV. \u201cThey have more important things to talk about like homelessness, not enough jobs, public hospitals completely out of control, so it is not something that is feeding back from the electorate through to me.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lambie said she would \u201chave a look\u201d at the bill but Tasmanians \u201cseem to be satisfied\u201d with the existing law and \u201cdon\u2019t really want this changed\u201d. Asked if she is concerned the bill overrides Tasmanian law, Lambie replied: \u201cI think that will upset Tasmanians more than the law itself, to be honest.

However, education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek and Senate leader Penny Wong have voiced concerns \u2013 citing the fact that the bill overrides state anti-discrimination laws. Despite claiming in July the government did not intend to displace state discrimination law, Porter\u2019s draft bill explicitly overrides the \u201coffend, insult or humiliate\u201d provision of Tasmania\u2019s Anti-Discrimination Act. Provided an expression of religious speech is made in good faith, is not malicious and would not \u201charass, vilify or incite hatred or violence\u201d, then it will not constitute unlawful discrimination under federal or state law. LGBT activists and discrimination experts have warned that statements of \u201creligious belief\u201d could license offensive views about women, racial minorities and disabled people, while the Law Council has noted the bill also changes the standard in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act which, similarly, prohibits speech which offends, insults or humiliates people based on race. Equality Tasmania spokesman Rodney Croome praised Lambie for questioning the need for the federal law, arguing the bill would \u201ctake away legal protections for vulnerable Tasmanians as well as the right of all Tasmanians to make our own human rights laws\u201d. \u201cThe people who will suffer most from the proposed federal override of our state discrimination protections are Tasmanians vulnerable to hate and discrimination, including people with disability, single parents, unmarried partners, ethnic minorities and LGBTI people,\u201d he said.",

Labor opposes mandatory sentencing. Would you oppose this bill?</p> \n  <p><strong>TB: </strong>Let\u2019s make it clear what the government is doing, because this one is horrific, I have to say. We are dealing with responses to the royal commission established by <strong>Julia Gillard</strong> into institutional child sexual abuse. </p> \n  <p>If there was ever an issue where we should not be playing political games, this one is it. I mean really. When <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>says he wants to find a test for Labor, he wants to choose child sexual abuse as a political game. Really?</p> \n  <p><strong>PK: </strong>There\u2019s no evidence that it is a game.</p> \n  <p><strong>TB: </strong>I am going to continue. On the reason for our objection for mandatory sentencing it is really simple. It often results in people who would otherwise be found guilty getting off scot-free, if a judge forms a view that the mandatory penalty is inappropriate given all the circumstances of the offence. </p> \n  <p>That is the challenge on any of this. Obviously, when these issues have come forward in the House of Representatives, we have made clear, voted for them, send them to the Senate and the Senate inquiry works out whether or not there are ways of amending, but the principle here is something that we are going to get a lot this time because our amendments are rarely successful. </p> \n  <p>In the first vote, we are voting for something we support and something that we think could be done better. Obviously, without going through them in detail, these are the sorts of offences where we ... believe there should be viewed as the most offensive, sinister offences, and in the next question is does that mean you vote against it because you think the sentencing could be done a better way? When it came to the House of Representatives on these issues we supported the bill as a whole, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we think it would be far more effective, far more effective if we had maximum sentences rather than mandatory. It\u2019s just more effective, you have more convictions that way.</p> \n  <p><strong>PK</strong>: We may see the same thing you have seen before from Labor when you push for the amendments, make the argument but ultimately vote for the legislation?</p> \n  <p><strong>TB:</strong> I am not going to get an advance of Senate inquiries but it will often be the case that when we are forced to look at the bill and if we are better off having it as a whole or not, it is better having it rather than aspects we could amend. </p> \n  <p>It would be a strange opposition if you said because it wasn\u2019t word for word what you wanted it to be, you would always oppose it. That is not folding, that is the political reality of not being able to get all your amendments through, you are facing some things you support and something you think could be done better, and you have to vote for them in the same moment.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T06:36:09.698Z\">at 7.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d75ed1e8f08143ee1ae2af8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T06:12:17.260Z\">7.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The talented Guardian video folks have put together a bit of a supercut of some of the condolence speeches for <strong>Tim Fischer</strong>:<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus/status/1170940666999762945\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Tim transcended the political divide\" says Scott Morrison as Parliament pays respects to Tim Fischer <a href=\"https://t.co/7I2JIN1Ezf\">pic.twitter.com/7I2JIN1Ezf</a></p>\u2014 Guardian Australia (@GuardianAus) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus/status/1170940666999762945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d75ec448f08143ee1ae2af6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T06:10:20.070Z\">7.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Tony Burke </strong>is speaking to <strong>Patricia Karvelas </strong>on the ABC about what Jacqui Lambie\u2019s demand for <strong>John Setka</strong> to resign from the union movement will mean for the ensuring integrity bill:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Jacqui Lambie, I don\u2019t think anyone is surprised that she takes very strong views.

It\u2019s disastrous. It is deliberately an anti-union bill designed to make it as difficult as possible for workers to be able to organise. That is what the government has done, that is why it is there and if it ends up going through, its impact will be way beyond one person in one union.</p> \n  <p><strong>PK: </strong>But will he be responsible?</p> \n  <p><strong>TB: </strong>Look, the concept of him acting responsibly, I think we are a long way from. It is going to be a matter for him to decide whether or not he thinks he is bigger than the rest of the union movement. There are a whole lot of workers and a whole lot of organisers with a lot at stake here but, as I say, I am not encouraging Jacqui Lambie to vote for these reasons, I want her to oppose the bill

He says, \u2018We can\u2019t say definitively that climate change is causing bushfires but we can say definitively it\u2019s making them a lot worse than it used to be. They\u2019re more severe, more intense, burning larger areas than before, posing greater threats to property and lives.\u2019 Do you agree with that?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong> DL:</strong> </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, we\u2019ve been adapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we\u2019ll have to continue to do that, and do that with the best science we\u2019ve got available at the time to make sure we keep our Australians safe. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. And the fact that we haven\u2019t lost a life shows that we have a world-class emergency service system here in the country. We should be so proud of those men and women that are not only the professionals, but those that are volunteers, prepared to sacrifice themselves for their fellow Australians \u2013 says a lot about our country and we\u2019ll continue to give them the equipment and the tools that they need to be able to keep us all safe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>HM:</strong> </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With respect, Minister, I\u2019m sure our listeners will have heard that you didn\u2019t quite answer that question. I take your point about the longterm change in climate, but this is a question about whether the climate change we\u2019re facing today, manmade or human-induced climate change, is making bushfires more intense?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>DL:</strong> </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, with respect, I did answer it. <strong>We\u2019re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we\u2019ll continue to equip our service workers with that. Whether it\u2019s manmade or not is irrelevant. </strong>The facts are that it\u2019s a debate that has extremes from both sides come out \u2013 rather than \u2026a discussion about do we want to breathe healthy air. Well I think everyone wants to breathe healthy air. The reality is my job is to make sure that those men and women that are prepared to put their lives on the line for you and me have the equipment they need, they are given the tools and resources they need, they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe. And how do we equip them to actually deal with that to not only keep up safe but keep them safe?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>HM</strong>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But you don\u2019t want a conversation about the causes of that?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>DL:</strong> </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s, as I\u2019ve said, the facts are everyone wants a healthier environment in which to live. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s talking about that. In fact, we\u2019ve \u2013 I think even last week \u2013 we\u2019re going to meet our renewable energy target of 33,000 gigawatts, and done that by next year. And that\u2019s an accomplishment that we\u2019ve done as a government, with subsidies, and now we\u2019re saying that the marketplace can decide. And, as even the Clean Energy Commission said last week that they\u2019re the cheapest form of energy. Well the market will decide that.

      "bodyText": "And on that note, we are going to call time on today, otherwise known as the Jacqui Lambie show. Because today, it really, really was. Shadow cabinet will meet tonight ahead of the Labor caucus meeting tomorrow. Cabinet will meet tomorrow ahead of party room meetings. We\u2019ll all still be talking about the economy and whose side are you on, because that\u2019s politics at this point in 2019. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, who is still out and about roaming the hallways and chambers, and Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and the others whose names you don\u2019t get to see, but are just as important to getting this blog off the ground. As always, thank you to those who keep me informed of what is happening in the dusty corners, so we can get the most accurate and up to date information to you as soon as possible \u2013 we do appreciate it. As always, mistakes are mine. And of course, to you all for following along with us. We missed you these past five weeks and are thrilled to have the below-the-line community back with us. We will be back online bright and early tomorrow morning. In the meantime, please \u2013 take care of you. In two interviews \u2013 with Sky and ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing \u2013 Labor\u2019s Tony Burke has been asked about Labor\u2019s position on mandatory minimum sentences for paedophiles. The reason is that last week the attorney general, Christian Porter, and home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, announced the government would introduce a bill with mandatory sentences. The issue is difficult for Labor because its platform opposes mandatory sentencing, as Kim Carr has forcefully noted in the party room, but Burke seems to be signalling it may support such a bill despite opposing that element. However, the issue will not be decided tonight at shadow cabinet or tomorrow at caucus \u2013 because the Coalition has removed mandatory sentences from the Combatting Child Sexual Exploitation Legislation Amendment bill 2019 \u2013 which is before the parliament. So mandatory sentences are likely a problem for another day when the Coalition introduces a new bill. On medevac and the Tamil family the Biloela community are fighting to have stay, Jacqui Lambie has this to say. Medevac: We are still watching the process go through, I am still, my door is still open to talk to people out there, we are running through certain options to have a look and see if there are other options that the government hasn\u2019t bothered to look at. So we are still working on this, so I have not concluded one way or another which way I am voting on it. Biloela: ... there\u2019s people in Australia that talk about migrants and they talk about refugees, and there\u2019s some of that that are quite bad and we don\u2019t want them here, and here\u2019s a family that has led by example, you know. It has had one of their children here. The community obviously love them. There has been a big community uptake on the support for them. They are not a national security issue. Really, this was a chance for Dutton and his office to show a bit of heart and show some compassion and he has failed to do that and I think it has done him a hell of a lot more harm than bloody good, that\u2019s for sure. But I would really reconsider his position, Dutton, if I was him because it is not very good. This is not the way we do things in this country. You know, they have been great people to have here, they\u2019ve obviously shown that, like I said, the community uptake has been absolutely amazing out there, so really I think this has not been a good decision by Dutton at all. If I was him, I\u2019d show some compassion and heart. Everyone out there seems to say he hasn\u2019t got any, so he could turn the tide a little bit. I mean, it is sitting in front of him for goodness sake, and let this family say. Jacqui Lambie tells Patricia Karvelas she doesn\u2019t see a case for the religious discrimination bill, at this point in time, which is pretty strong: I know that the religious freedoms we have in Tasmania, as they are now, they are working pretty well and I don\u2019t have a lot of people around Tasmania talking to me about religious freedom. They have more important things to talk about like homelessness, not enough jobs, public hospitals completely out of control, so it is not something that is feeding back from the electorate through to me. We are certainly having a look at the bill, but Tasmania is very similar to the one that has been in place now, and so, there doesn\u2019t seem... Tasmania seems to be satisfied with that, so I will have to do take that on that they don\u2019t really want this changed. On Paul Karp\u2019s story that part of the federal legislation includes a clause which would allow it to override state laws \u2013 which will impact Tasmania particularly \u2013 Lambie had this to say: I think that will upset Tasmanians more than the law itself to be honest. They seem to be satisfied, nobody wants to talk about it, they were delivered as it is. Q: You don\u2019t see the case for this bill? Not at this point in time. Unless there is a real pickup, and a lot more Tasmanians are speaking to me about it, I guess at this point in time, it will stay as is. For the millionth time today, Jacqui Lambie confirms she will not vote for the drug testing bill. Speaking to Afternoon Briefing on the ABC, Lambie said this: Q: If the government promises funding for extra drug and alcohol treatment, will that be enough? JL: Absolutely not. Usually when the buildings go up and how many beds are in there, and we will go back to the table and discuss it. Q: So you will vote this down until the services are up and running, not just on a promise of a funding commitment? JL: I tend to like to put the horse before the cart before the cart before the horse, it works much better that way. Q: Does that mean that there is no way you will vote for this bill? JL: We not voting for this bill because I already know the services are not there. You put the services in place first, the commonsense way to tackle this issue, and then we can look at doing random drug and alcohol testing on welfare recipients. In the meantime, show some goodwill and put it on yourselves and anyone else on the public purse. Q: There is no way this bill will pass in the next fortnight, right? JL: No, unless you will put thousands of rehab beds in Australia in that time, [and they\u2019ve struggled to do that in the last four years] let alone make that happen in the next fortnight. One of the big issues at Labor\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting this afternoon will be whether or not the party supports the government\u2019s revived mandatory sentencing bill for federal sex offenders. Tony Burke had this to say in response to Patricia Karvelas questions: PK: The government is reintroducing legislation that were tough on federal penalties for people convicted of child sex offences. Labor opposes mandatory sentencing. Would you oppose this bill? TB: Let\u2019s make it clear what the government is doing, because this one is horrific, I have to say. We are dealing with responses to the royal commission established by Julia Gillard into institutional child sexual abuse. If there was ever an issue where we should not be playing political games, this one is it. I mean really. When Scott Morrison says he wants to find a test for Labor, he wants to choose child sexual abuse as a political game. Really? PK: There\u2019s no evidence that it is a game. TB: I am going to continue. On the reason for our objection for mandatory sentencing it is really simple. It often results in people who would otherwise be found guilty getting off scot-free, if a judge forms a view that the mandatory penalty is inappropriate given all the circumstances of the offence. That is the challenge on any of this. Obviously, when these issues have come forward in the House of Representatives, we have made clear, voted for them, send them to the Senate and the Senate inquiry works out whether or not there are ways of amending, but the principle here is something that we are going to get a lot this time because our amendments are rarely successful. In the first vote, we are voting for something we support and something that we think could be done better. Obviously, without going through them in detail, these are the sorts of offences where we ... believe there should be viewed as the most offensive, sinister offences, and in the next question is does that mean you vote against it because you think the sentencing could be done a better way? When it came to the House of Representatives on these issues we supported the bill as a whole, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we think it would be far more effective, far more effective if we had maximum sentences rather than mandatory. It\u2019s just more effective, you have more convictions that way. PK: We may see the same thing you have seen before from Labor when you push for the amendments, make the argument but ultimately vote for the legislation? TB: I am not going to get an advance of Senate inquiries but it will often be the case that when we are forced to look at the bill and if we are better off having it as a whole or not, it is better having it rather than aspects we could amend. It would be a strange opposition if you said because it wasn\u2019t word for word what you wanted it to be, you would always oppose it. That is not folding, that is the political reality of not being able to get all your amendments through, you are facing some things you support and something you think could be done better, and you have to vote for them in the same moment. The talented Guardian video folks have put together a bit of a supercut of some of the condolence speeches for Tim Fischer: Tony Burke is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on the ABC about what Jacqui Lambie\u2019s demand for John Setka to resign from the union movement will mean for the ensuring integrity bill: Jacqui Lambie, I don\u2019t think anyone is surprised that she takes very strong views. She has strong opinions, it is a matter for her how she wants to vote. For me, I view the bill very much on the issue of its merits, but I talked to the Senate crossbench, I make the case that they will choose their own freedom to make a decision. PK: But if John Setka refuses to resign and the integrity bill passes, how will he be remembered in the union movement given that he now appears to be causing its potential success, according to Jacqui Lambie. TB: I don\u2019t think Jacqui Lambie is bluffing, and it is also my view that the potential impact of this bill on the whole trade union movement is disastrous. It\u2019s disastrous. It is deliberately an anti-union bill designed to make it as difficult as possible for workers to be able to organise. That is what the government has done, that is why it is there and if it ends up going through, its impact will be way beyond one person in one union. PK: But will he be responsible? TB: Look, the concept of him acting responsibly, I think we are a long way from. It is going to be a matter for him to decide whether or not he thinks he is bigger than the rest of the union movement. There are a whole lot of workers and a whole lot of organisers with a lot at stake here but, as I say, I am not encouraging Jacqui Lambie to vote for these reasons, I want her to oppose the bill because on merit it\u2019s a bad piece of legislation. And for something a little more uplifting than question time: And he was also there for question time: Mike Bowers was there during the condolence motion for former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer. With a hat tip to the Herald Sun\u2019s James Campbell for the inspiration, Dorothy Dixers shall now be known as Lickspittles. For anyone who missed the Greens\u2019 victory (with assists from Labor, Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie, as well as the last-minute decision of One Nation to abstain) this morning, here you go: And question time ends. But first we have to congratulate the Australian cricket team. Especially Tim Paine. Because this is what we use parliament for now. How good is sportsball? Clare O\u2019Neil to Josh Frydenberg: Can the treasurer confirm that under this Coalition government business investment has fallen 20% to its lowest level since the 1990s recession? Frydenberg: Mr Speaker, I can confirm non-mining investment is growing 1.4% through the year, compared to negative 8.4% through the year when Labor left office, Mr Speaker. So the record there is that that we have overseen a better result when it comes to non-mining investment than the Labor party did, Mr Speaker. Now, in terms of the mining sector, we have seen a transition from the investment stage to the production phase, and one of the positive points out of the national accounts for the June quarter was actually mining investment was up. Mining investment was up, Mr Speaker. So the reality is, under the Coalition, we are creating more than 1.4 million new jobs. We are lowering taxes, Mr Speaker, and we\u2019re bringing the budget back into surplus. But the question I have for the member of Hotham and those opposite is why do they continue to talk down the Australian economy, Mr Speaker? Anthony Albanese asks if the opposition can answer the question. Tony Smith says sadly no, but Frydenberg is straying off the topic and to get on with it. Frydenberg: As I have said, our record of investment is better than the Labor party when it comes to the non-mining sector, Mr Speaker. We\u2019ve created more jobs, we\u2019re lowering taxes and we\u2019re bringing the budget back into surplus. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: After more than six years of this government, when growth is the slowest it has been in a decade, wages are stagnant, consumption is weak, household debt is at record highs, and productivity has actually gone backwards over the last year, why does the prime minister spend all of his time talking about Labor and none of his time coming up with a plan to turn the economy around? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. 1.4 million jobs created under the economic policies of this government, Mr Speaker. 75% of those full-time jobs, Mr Speaker. A budget that is coming back into surplus this year, this year, Mr Speaker. Real wage growth occurring under this government, Mr Speaker. Real wage growth occurring under this government. That\u2019s what... Mr Speaker, people are not only earning more, they are getting to keep more of what they earn and we want them to earn more in the future. But you won\u2019t get higher wages with higher taxes. That\u2019s what the Labor party never understands. They never understand that if they want to tax people more, they they will slow the economy, which will thieve them, Mr Speaker, of their economic opportunities. Tony Burke: He couldn\u2019t even get to 45 seconds before he started talking about Labor. The question is asking him what is his plan \u2013 he is meant to be running an economy. Tony Smith: I\u2019m not quite sure what the point of order is. He didn\u2019t state one. But I will just say that several of the topics in the question was Labor, so he didn\u2019t put it there. The prime minister has the call. Morrison: Our plan, which is to bring the budget back into surplus this year. Our plan, which has been to deliver tax cuts to Australians. Our plan, which is to deliver hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure, which includes $10bn this year, which is 10% higher than the annual spend on infrastructure this year than occurred under the Labor party. So more investment in infrastructure, more investment in skills, skills expansion of our markets. We\u2019ve taken the trade covered by our export agreements from less than 30% to 70% and we will take it to 90%, Mr Speaker. The agricultural sector is growing at a \u2013 it will be a $100bn sector by 2030 under the plan we are putting in place. So we have a plan, Mr Speaker. But what is happening on the side of the Labor party, and I was asked about the Labor party, is chaos. It\u2019s chaos and uncertainty and in New South Wales, there is the big stench of corruption, Mr Speaker. What we\u2019re seeing in New South Wales \u2013 the Leader of the Opposition\u2019s home division \u2013 is \u2013 when I said, and I mentioned on the weekend, when I said we had to recycle plastics, Mr Speaker, I didn\u2019t mean Aldi plastic bags stuffed full of cash. That was not my plan, Mr Speaker! But it is certainly the plan of the New South Wales Labor party. Michael McCormack does his best impression of an unseasoned chicken wing in delivering his latest dixer answer. Moving on. Catherine King to Scott Morrison: Why has the prime minister ignored seven calls from the Reserve Bank governor since the election to increase infrastructure spending? Morrison: Let me quote from the Reserve Bank governor, August 9, health economics committee. The global economy is not doing well, we need ... public policy to support the Australian policy, that is not a call for the Australian government to do more now. I am quoting the governor of the reserve bank. He said can I clarify something. I have not called on the government to do fiscal expansion, quoting the governor of the Reserve Bank, giving evidence, not some chat to a journalist, but evidence, to the House economics committee. He said I am not calling on the government to do fiscal expansion. On 11 July he said I agree 100% with you the Australian economy is growing and the fundamentals are strong. I don\u2019t think we should forget that more Australians have jobs today than ever before. ... The Reserve Bank on the evidence of the parliamentary committee has been very clear. What I know is I have been working with the Reserve Bank governor as both the treasurer and prime minister for four years, it is as a result of the Reserve Bank governor years ago, suggestions to us about the need to move on infrastructure, that we have the hundred billion dollar infrastructure pipeline, that has been in the budget since April of this year, and is featured in previous budgets. I know those opposite, if they had the opportunity, would be spending, spending, spending, if they had won the election, only because they would have been taxing, taxing, taxing. The first whiff of a surplus, the Labor party would blow it all in a heartbeat. What my government is doing is showing sober, cautious, disciplined financial management, Mr Speaker, to make sure we both achieve the first surplus in 12 years, and we deliver on the hundred billion dollar infrastructure program, we deliver on the tax cuts we promise to Australians, and we have achieved in this parliament, which those opposite fought tooth and nail to try and stop. Those opposite, we heard earlier today, that apparently they will not find out what their policies are until 2022. He will need a time machine to find out their policies. Whether you go backwards or forwards, they will all equate to economic irresponsibility. While I continue my death to dixers crusade, you might be interested in putting in a submission to this inquiry: Josh Frydenberg is now talking about people coming out of the shadows. I don\u2019t know who writes his dixer answers, but I really, really hope they update their references soon. We don\u2019t come out of the shadows any more, we serve the tea. The member for Warringah, Zali Steggall, has the independents\u2019 question. The times are serious, peak medical bodies last week declared a health climate emergency, recognising the severe effect climate change will have on children, being more vulnerable to hypoallergenic conditions and lung disease. Today emergency services are saying the fires in New South Wales and Queensland are unprecedented this early in spring. Scientists have been warning about these dangers for years. Does the prime minister agree Australia needs a real plan to decarbonise every polluting sector by 2020, and will such a plan be presented to this parliament? Scott Morrison: The government agrees we need to take action on climate change and that is why we are. We will meet the targets that were set. When we came to government we were going to miss those targets by 700 million tonnes. What is going to happen now? We will exceed meeting those targets by 367 million tonnes. There has been over a million tonne turnaround. As a result of the policies of this government, put in place over the last six years to make sure we are meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets, we had the plan to meet the 2030 targets as well as we set out in the last election, responsible targets, tonne by tonne, to make sure we meet our 2020 commitments. We take these commitments seriously. We will make sure they are met. On top of that, we will have emissions per capita fall by 50% by 2030, under the policies we took to the last election, emissions per capita at the lowest level in 29 years. We are taking the action needed to address climate change. The renewable investments per capita are currently the highest in the world, the highest in the world. We are in the middle of a renewable energy boom, that is the reason why we will be meeting our renewable energy target we should be committed to meet as a government. Whether it\u2019s on emissions reduction, renewable energy, the government has a plan, has committed to targets, is implementing the plan and will meet the targets. The government is taking action on climate change as we should, we will continue to take that action in a responsible way, where we don\u2019t have to sell out the jobs for the future, to make sure we have the future of a clean and green environment. That sound you hear is Pat Conroy screaming into the void. We come back from the latest dixer (it sounds as if Scott Morrison\u2019s voice is going). Maybe he gave it to Josh Frydenberg, who, despite his talents, is yet to work out how a microphone works, in that you DON\u2019T HAVE TO YELL INTO ONE TO HAVE YOUR VOICE AMPLIFIED BECAUSE THAT IS THE JOB OF THE MICROPHONE. Jim Chalmers: Can the treasurer confirmed that the Australian economy is growing substantially slower than forecast in his budget just five months ago? Frydenberg: I can confirm with the House when it comes to nominal GDP, it is growing above the budget forecast! Above the forecast! 5.3%, and the budget forecast was 5%. ... The reality is, we on this side of the House stand for lower taxes. We have passed through the parliament the most significant tax cuts and more than two decades. You know who oppose those tax cuts? The member for Rankin. He likes to take the... Imagine that in all caps. Because that is how it was delivered. Tony Burke says the question was specific, and Christian Porter says \u201cthe question went to the issue of economic growth, which relates to a wide variety of issues\u201d. Tony Smith points out that the treasurer started to yell about tax, which is off topic. Frydenberg comes back, with less yelling: For the member for Rankin\u2019s information, on average terms the economy grew 1.9% for 2018/19, the budget forecast was 2.5%, Mr Speaker. When it comes to nominal GDP, the economy grew by 5.3%, the budget forecast was 5%. As the member for Rankin should know, as the understudy to the former member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, the nominal GDP numbers drive the budget outcomes. We will bring the budget back into surplus for the first time in more than a decade. And you can strengthen the Australian economy by creating more jobs, by seeing the proportion of working age Australians on welfare at its lowest level in 30 years, and by cutting taxes which we have done against the will of those opposite. I know that we have had a break and we are all a bit rusty at this at the moment, but someone might need to tell the government backbench that the phrases \u201ctax a lot\u201d and \u201cspend a lot\u201d are not funny on their own, and there usually needs to be an actual attempt at a joke attached, in order to make laughter make sense. (Just a reminder that the unemployment rate hasn\u2019t changed that much between governments, and there was that whole global financial crisis thing that happened as well.) Back to \u2018why are you ruining the economy/no, why are YOU ruining the economy\u2019 hour. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Can the treasurer confirmed that on his watch Australia is experiencing the slowest annual economic since the global financial crisis? Frydenberg: I can confirm that on our watch that the Australian economy continues to grow, Mr Speaker, and we continue to reduce taxes. Employment growth is 2.6%. Do you know what it was when we came to government? 0.7% \u2013 less than a third of what it is today. A record number of Australians are now in work, workforce participation is at a record high, the gender pay gap has closed and the budget is coming back to surplus for the first time in more than a decade, Mr Speaker. When you look at the national accounts, economic growth was 0.5% for the June quarter, and 1.9% in terms of year-average terms. The Australian economy has completed 28 consecutive years of economic growth and under our watch more people are employed than ever before. Both Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese have given updates on the Queensland and NSW bushfire situation (it is not great and won\u2019t be for a while) and pledged support. Just a reminder that rainforest is on fire. Rainforest. I grew up in the area which is under threat in Queensland at the moment, and I have never seen this before in my lifetime and I don\u2019t know anyone who has. Bear with me, folks. The internet gremlins have been running riot all week in Guardian HQ and my backup to the backup is starting to fail, so excuse me if the blog slows down a little. Over in the Senate, Labor has been focusing on the economy and it looks like that is where Labor is headed in the House as well. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to his weekend boasts that he was going to wedge Labor in the sitting period. As any golfer knows, while wedges are handy, drivers are what you need to get going. Given Australia is experiencing the slowest economic growth since the global financial crisis, why is the prime minister not concentrating on economic drivers to deliver growth, productivity and higher wages? Morrison: We are focused on growing the economy and Labor wanted to put on a bunch of taxes and also there are a bunch of other economies are shrinking and Australia grew, so so\u2019s your face. I may be paraphasing there. Sussan Ley on Tim Fischer: He travelled among us, he spoke for us and we loved him for that. Whenever I drive the back roads of my electorate, I will be reminded of the Vietnam veteran, the farmer, in the flat chat, who strode amongst us, and his passion for finding a place for country Australia on the world stage. He defined a time when the body politic was a lot kinder than it is today, in part that will be his legacy. The thoughts, prayers and love of Farrer are with Judy, who taught me economics at university, Dominic and Harrison, as they face the difficult weeks and months ahead. Richard Marles on Tim Fischer: He was not just an example of the electorate of Farrer, he was the very best that that community, indeed the nation, had to offer. So, as a result, his community loved him. As did his country. In a way which completely transcended partisan politics. But he also understood that to be a representative is not just about reflecting the attitudes of your community at any moment in time, because he understood the role of leadership. Leading your community, leading your country to a better place, even if that is a place which at the beginning your community can\u2019t quite see. It was in that spirit that his advocacy for gun law reform in the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre was truly inspirational. It places right at the centre of one of the most important legacies of the Howard government. And, in our own age of a pre-eminent, loud, self-reinforcing social media, which sometimes seems to encourage populism, his making of an argument, that example is a beacon to all of us here about how to do our job at the highest level, and in the best possible way. Michael McCormack on Tim Fischer: Behind the gentle man was an absolute determination to listen, to act and deliver. Most importantly to turn up, to turn up. Much has been said and written in recent weeks about Tim\u2019s role with then prime minister John Howard in tightening semiautomatic and firearm controls after the horrific 1996 Port Arthur massacre. This was all about restricting the misuse of weapons, especially across urban areas. To be effective, the actions had to stretch nationwide. We need to understand he was the leader of a party representing regional Australians, not long in government after 13 long years in opposition. This was a time of intensive work to establish a new agenda. To establish credentials of the new government, to bring the people with them. This was not a time to rock the vote and it was particularly difficult for the National party. But the point is this: Tim Fischer and Mr Howard as well, John Anderson and others saw what needed to be done, and they didn\u2019t flinch. They didn\u2019t shirk. They did it. A lesser leader might have balked, but not Tim Fischer. He was convinced that action was needed, what was right took precedence over what might have seemed less risky, less challenging. It was a move of conviction. It was a difficult time, yes, but we had the right man in Tim Fischer. There are Australians today who are alive thanks to those reforms. There are Australians today who owe their lives to those reforms and to Tim Fischer. As we look back two decades, we see that gun control reforms have enjoyed rightly, appropriately, justly. Scott Morrison on Tim Fischer: Mr Speaker, Timothy Andrew Fisher was Australia all over. He was an Australian original, the boy from Boree Creek. He was loved, he was admired, he was respected, he was revered. He became from humble beginnings in Boree Creek and at the recent memorial service which the leader of the opposition and I and many in this place had the opportunity to attend, we learned of his humble family beginning, in a very loving and hard-working family, and coming from such a modest start, to become the titan of regional Australia, was his greatest achievement. Like Bob Hawke, who we remembered in this chamber just a few short months ago, Tim transcended the political divide probably more than any I could nominate in this place. That\u2019s why I think so many of us in this chamber, and those who have been in this chamber, we all have a Tim Fischer story. If you ever wanted to know what it\u2019s like to tour with Elvis, go on the Indian Pacific with Tim Fischer for three days. I did. And as you walked up and down the carriages, among so many other railway enthusiasts, there was none greater than Tim Fischer. He would stop, sit, listen to their stories, those big hands would shake the hands of his fellow Australians. And people would just light up as they engaged with him because Tim had an amazing ability just to focus all of himself on whoever was opposite him. And he made them the centre of the universe. There was no trick to it. No performance in it. It was 100% pure Tim Fischer. They got 100% of him when he was in that moment. This is why he was so loved. Question time is about to begin \u2013 but there are those condolence motions up first, understandably. Mike Bowers went and saw the Spinifex Gum and the Marliya Choir perform in parliament a little bit earlier today. He said it was spine tinglingly beautiful. Along with the condolence motion for former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Tim Fischer, the House will also be informed of the death of former Labor Lilley MP Elaine Darling. Just on that review, for anyone who is interested, there is a bit of to and fro-ing going on behind the scenes over how to handle what is being called \u201cthe Queensland problem\u201d. The Queensland Labor government goes to an election in October 2020 \u2013 one of the first cabs off the ranks \u2013 and it is not having too great a time at the moment (largely self-inflicted). But Labor has a much better chance of winning Queensland at a state level than federal at the moment (and probably for some time). That\u2019s because there are enough seats in the south-east to help it hold power. But those voters tend to worry about things like climate change. Which is different from voters in central and north Queensland, who need the jobs provided by the mining industry. So the review can\u2019t go too hard on Queensland, either way. And that is proving a little problematic, because obviously Queensland was a big part of the election story. It\u2019s a balance between state and federal goals. And that is not a job I envy anyone. Mark Butler had a bit to say about the review Labor is currently undertaking into what happened at the last election. As Katharine Murphy reports: The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has declared that after a federal election where Labor had its \u201cbackside handed to [it] by Fozzie Bear and Kermit the Frog \u2013 it\u2019s time for some serious reflection\u201d. Butler, a senior Labor leftwinger and former federal party president, said on Monday the ALP should not attempt to sugarcoat the defeat in May, but instead ask itself hard questions. \u201cWe just lost our third election in a row and the only majority we\u2019ve won in the past 25 years was the majority of eight seats in 2007,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got our lowest primary vote in a century, against a government the prime minister himself described as the Muppet Show.\u201d Butler used the opportunity of a book launch in Canberra to argue the current campaign review being spearheaded by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson \u201cmust be ruthless and unsparing\u201d and include all policies, including in his portfolio area of climate change and energy. Question time will probably be shorter than usual today, because of condolence motions for Tim Fischer. David Littleproud\u2019s office has released the transcript of his conversation with Hamish Macdonald this morning, on RN. Here is the bit that led up to the \u201cirrelevant\u201d quote in relation to whether climate change was manmade or not: HM: Can I read you a quote from Ken Thompson, the former deputy commissioner of New South Wales Fire and Rescue? He says, \u2018We can\u2019t say definitively that climate change is causing bushfires but we can say definitively it\u2019s making them a lot worse than it used to be. They\u2019re more severe, more intense, burning larger areas than before, posing greater threats to property and lives.\u2019 Do you agree with that? DL: Well, we\u2019ve been adapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we\u2019ll have to continue to do that, and do that with the best science we\u2019ve got available at the time to make sure we keep our Australians safe. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. And the fact that we haven\u2019t lost a life shows that we have a world-class emergency service system here in the country. We should be so proud of those men and women that are not only the professionals, but those that are volunteers, prepared to sacrifice themselves for their fellow Australians \u2013 says a lot about our country and we\u2019ll continue to give them the equipment and the tools that they need to be able to keep us all safe. HM: With respect, Minister, I\u2019m sure our listeners will have heard that you didn\u2019t quite answer that question. I take your point about the longterm change in climate, but this is a question about whether the climate change we\u2019re facing today, manmade or human-induced climate change, is making bushfires more intense? DL: Well, with respect, I did answer it. We\u2019re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we\u2019ll continue to equip our service workers with that. Whether it\u2019s manmade or not is irrelevant. The facts are that it\u2019s a debate that has extremes from both sides come out \u2013 rather than \u2026a discussion about do we want to breathe healthy air. Well I think everyone wants to breathe healthy air. The reality is my job is to make sure that those men and women that are prepared to put their lives on the line for you and me have the equipment they need, they are given the tools and resources they need, they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe. And how do we equip them to actually deal with that to not only keep up safe but keep them safe? HM: But you don\u2019t want a conversation about the causes of that? DL: That\u2019s, as I\u2019ve said, the facts are everyone wants a healthier environment in which to live. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s talking about that. In fact, we\u2019ve \u2013 I think even last week \u2013 we\u2019re going to meet our renewable energy target of 33,000 gigawatts, and done that by next year. And that\u2019s an accomplishment that we\u2019ve done as a government, with subsidies, and now we\u2019re saying that the marketplace can decide. And, as even the Clean Energy Commission said last week that they\u2019re the cheapest form of energy. Well the market will decide that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done; we\u2019ve put an environment around that for that to take place. As for the other votes that were passed by the Greens, I have just been told it was these: 1. Territories Self-Government Legislation Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment of Laws) bill 2011 [previously Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010] Senate: Introduced by Senator Bob Brown 29/9/10; passed with amendments and read a third time 18/8/11. HoR: Introduced 22/8/11; read a third time 1/11/11. Assent: 4/12/11; Act no. 166 of 2011. 2. Low Aromatic Fuel bill 2012 Purpose: To mitigate the negative impacts of petrol sniffing in areas designated as low aromatic fuel areas and fuel control areas. Senate: Introduced by Senator Siewert 1/3/12; passed with amendments and read a third time 27/11/12. HoR: Introduced 28/11/12; read a third time 6/2/13. Assent: 14/2/13; Act no. 1 of 2013 (Act cited as Low Aromatic Fuel Act 2013). 3. Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) bill 2017 Introduced by: Senator Di Natale Date passed by Senate: 19 October 2017 4. Treasury Laws Amendment (Axe the Tampon Tax) bill 2018 Introduced by: Senator Rice Date passed by Senate: 18 June 2018 5 Fair Protection for Firefighters Bill 2011 (Adam Bandt) It doesn\u2019t look like Mitch Fifield (who is off to the UN and has been replaced by Sarah Henderson, although the Victorian parliament still needs to confirm that, officially) had a pair. Scott Morrison will be the 7.30 guest tonight. Just a reminder that the government controls the House of Reps agenda, and does not have to bring on the vote there until it wants to. That doesn\u2019t mean that Adam Bandt, Rebehka Sharkie and Labor can\u2019t attempt to force it on, and force the government to vote down even that attempt, but don\u2019t expect a vote on any of this too soon. Pauline Hanson has called in to Sydney radio station 2GB to explain why One Nation abstained \u2013 apparently Jacqui Lambie is \u201cwishy-washy\u201d. Hanson is also saying Richard Di Natale is ridiculous for blaming the Queensland fires on climate change before we know what caused them, as she blames the Queensland government for its land-clearing laws for those exact fires. Mike Bowers has been going since very early this morning. His week is going to look a lot like this. Adding to the weight of what just happened in the Senate, I\u2019m told this is just the fourth Greens bill to pass that chamber. Larissa Waters on that victory: After 10 years of attempts by the Greens to clean up politics, the Senate has just passed a Greens bill to set up a federal corruption watchdog with real teeth. Now the pressure is on the government to back this bill in the House, where the crossbench and opposition also want a strong corruption body, not the weak, toothless government proposal, which hasn\u2019t moved an inch for almost a year. For those asking, Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie voted for the bill, along with Labor and the Greens (who put it forward). That shouldn\u2019t be a surprise \u2013 Centre Alliance has been calling for a federal Icac for some time, while Lambie stood up with the crossbench last sitting and said she wanted one with \u201cmore teeth than Jaws\u201d. I think we can call that a victory for optics. With One Nation out of the chamber, the Greens win the vote, 35 to 32. The House will now be forced to vote the legislation down. So I guess some last minute thoughts hit the One Nation team - and they decided that actively voting against a federal integrity bill would not play well with the \u2018we keep the bastards honest\u2019 line. Without them, the bill gets up. Paul Karp tells me that One Nation is not in the chamber. Cory Bernardi is voting with the government. It looks like One Nation may have missed that vote \u2013 if they abstain, then the integrity bill will get up. The whip has asked Scott Ryan for some more time, so the bells will now ring for four minutes. So perhaps some people didn\u2019t get there in time. Or maybe the government is hoping that is the case. While the Senate can\u2019t force the House to do anything, it will force the government to vote it down. Looks like there were a few people who abstained there \u2013 so the Greens bill moves to its third reading. Ayes 35 Noes 32 The Senate bells are ringing for a division on Larissa Waters\u2019s national integrity commission bill \u2013 but unless Cory Bernardi changes tack, it will go down by one. There is no mention there, of tying her support to drug testing of politicians and public servants. It is however worth noting, that Jacqui Lambie has had personal experience with drug addition impacting her family, which she has been open about. So if anyone knows about accessing services here, it is her. Jacqui Lambie\u2019s office has released a statement on the drug-testing proposal. Here it is in full, because this morning has been a bit all over the place: This isn\u2019t really about getting people off drugs. It\u2019s about kicking people off payments. You can\u2019t punish someone for being on drugs if they don\u2019t have the help available to get them off it. We have to get the services in place to help people. The government hasn\u2019t done its due diligence here. It\u2019s put the cart before the horse. We have bugger all in place to help people with mental health let alone drug and alcohol rehabilitation. The fact the government wants to throw drug tests at everybody but themselves shows plain as day what the real agenda is. It\u2019s one rule for them, one for everyone else. They don\u2019t want a breathalyser at the chamber doors after those long dinner breaks where half of them get on the sauce. Bottom line is I\u2019m not going to punish people for seeking help and not getting it, because we\u2019re not making it available to them. We can\u2019t cut off a drug addict who\u2019s done the right thing in seeking treatment only to be told they have to wait 12 months for a rehab bed. They say taxpayers don\u2019t want their money going to drug dealers. What, are they going to test every ABC journo? Every pensioner? Every war veteran? Every school teacher? Let\u2019s get real. This isn\u2019t about who is getting tax dollars, it\u2019s about who\u2019s easy to take them from. So if this isn\u2019t about respecting taxpayers, then let\u2019s get real and make it about getting people off drugs full stop. You can\u2019t punish someone into going clean. If the government wants my vote on drug testing, it\u2019s time for them to step up and put comprehensive mental health and drug and alcohol rehabilitation services in place. They need to show that they are interested in more than punishing people who are on welfare. If you kick a drug addict off payments, they don\u2019t magically get better. They just become a junkie with a habit to service and no money to service it with. So what you end up seeing is more cars being broken into, more TVs being flogged at Cash Converters, more prostitution, more crime, more cost and no fewer drug addicts. Making an addict more desperate doesn\u2019t make them more healthy. My message to the government is simple: fix the support services and you\u2019ll get my support too. Until then, get off your high horse and get back to work. In case you missed it, this also happened this morning Larissa Waters has responded to the news that Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts will not support the Greens bill for a stronger federal Icac: This bill will pass or fall based on One Nation\u2019s vote. If One Nation vote against an anti-corruption body, their own voters will feel totally ripped off. If they side with government in wanting to turn a blind eye to federal corruption they might as well just join the Liberal party and be done with it.\u201d Malcolm Roberts is doing his best impression of a senator, and explaining why One Nation won\u2019t be supporting the bill as I type this. It looks as though the fate of the Greens Icac legislation could rest with conservative independent Cory Bernardi. One Nation has confirmed to Guardian Australia that it will not be supporting the Greens bill today, saying it has concerns that someone could be falsely accused under the current model. \u201cWe are happy to work with the Greens in the future and Labor and the Coalition to make sure we get it right,\u201d a spokesman said. He said the party supported the concept and need for a federal Icac but the Greens\u2019 proposal had several flaws. \u201cThere are a number of issues with it and this shouldn\u2019t be used as a political stunt, it should be used as a means to bring about some positive change.\u201d Even if the Greens have the support of Labor (26 votes), Centre Alliance (2 votes) and Jacqui Lambie, it will fall short of having a majority of 39 votes unless it can convince conservative Cory Bernardi to support the bill. Bernardi has not yet responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for clarity on his position, but we will keep you posted. Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt will be treated to a performance from Spinifex Gum and the Marliya choir. Spinifex Gum is a group of talented, young Indigenous women (the Marliya choir) whose performances intend to inspire national dialogue through music, with song cycles that reflect the dramatic contrasts of Australian life.\u201d That will be held in parliament house at midday. Read more about their vocal petition here: And watch them perform their version of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Dream Baby Dream, which calls on Australians to support the Uluru Statement from the Heart and establish an Indigenous voice in the constitution: Labor will support a Greens bill to establish a federal anti-corruption commission. The decision has been signed off by the opposition this morning, with a vote likely in the Senate later today. The government is opposed to the legislation, but the Greens are confident they will be able to win over enough of the crossbench for a bill to establish a new federal Icac to pass the Senate. Labor has 26 votes in the Senate and the Greens have nine, but 39 votes are needed to secure an absolute majority. The Public Health Association of Australia is the latest organisation to come out and call for the Newstart allowance to be raised, saying it was a mental health issue: Australians in the lowest socioeconomic group experience the worst health,\u201d said CEO Terry Slevin said. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that those in the lowest wealth quintile (when compared with the most well-off) are 2.3 times as high for diabetes, two times as high for lung cancer, 1.8 times as high for anxiety disorders and 1.5 times as high for the combined impact on health measured by \u201cburden of disease\u201d. Most people on Newstart get on and off it quickly, but many are on it for a long time living with poverty and mental stress. An increasing number are homeless. \u201cThe punitive low rate of Newstart is having a crippling effect on people who are unemployed. They are sick with worry about how to afford shelter, healthcare, medicines and food to eat.\u201d As the Productivity Commission\u2019s current mental health inquiry has heard, there is a strong relationship between low income levels and psychological distress, economic participation and mental health and wellbeing. Long-term unemployment is associated with depression and social isolation, and as individuals move from unemployment to work their mental health tends to improve. \u201cThe prime minister has set an ambitious agenda to improve mental health among Australians. Raising Newstart should be among a comprehensive suite of solutions,\u201d said Slevin. We are now in the \u201cI will take a drug test, no problem\u201d stage of the political cycle. Eric Abetz just told Sky he would have no problem with taking a test while talking on Sky. Totally normal day in Australian politics. Just a reminder, that according to that little document called the constitution, no one can actually sack a politician, except for the high court (and the electorate). You can kick someone out of your party, but you can\u2019t strip them of their place in parliament. But, yes, let\u2019s continue with this. And there go the bells. Huzzah. The bells are about to ring, marking the beginning of the new session. Obviously, my excitement levels are through the roof. For those playing along at home Jacqui Lambie has given a press conference in which she has said she won\u2019t support drug testing for welfare recipients unless there is infrastructure in place, and she doesn\u2019t think that (counselling services and the like) is there yet. She also wants to look more at what is happening in communities where the cashless debit card has been rolled out before making a decision on a national rollout. She plans to visit areas where it\u2019s in place where she will chat to people on the ground. Oh \u2013 and she still wants John Setka to resign. Rachel Siewert says the Greens will continue to fight against the cashless welfare card: This is not a government with an agenda based on evidence, it\u2019s all ideology and it entrenches poverty and disadvantage. This most recent push is also designed as a distraction from the gathering momentum to raise the rate of Newstart. I\u2019m urging Senator Lambie and the opposition to listen to the community and the evidence and not to fall for this government spin. This card makes life hard for people on low incomes. Just last week I was in Ceduna and what we heard from the community was devastating. People can\u2019t just get on with their day-to day-lives, they feel stigmatised, angry and depressed with simple things like using the laundry mat a major stress. My office deals with people daily who cannot pay their rent or bills using the card or are not able to use cash economies like markets, secondhand shops or op shops to help them make ends meets \u2013 and I heard the same thing in Ceduna last week. In \u201cplease set everything on fire and just start again\u201d news, the AFR\u2019s Joe Aston reports that Scott Morrison is calling the new Australian VIP jet \u201cShark One\u201d. Jacqui Lambie looks as though she\u2019s about to speak to the media \u2013 I\u2019ll keep you updated. Anthony Albanese has stopped by the doors (the doors to parliament that MPs only come by when they have something to say) to remind Scott Morrison that he won the election. I think he knows, but given that most normal people I know have completely switched off from federal politics, it is possible that there are some still out there who don\u2019t know who the prime minister is. Albanese\u2019s wider point is the one he has been making since he took over the leadership \u2013 it is not all about Labor. This fortnight, the prime minister re-enters parliament after a break where we have had quite disturbing economic figures across the board. What we have is lower economic growth. We have a Reserve Bank governor calling for infrastructure investment to be brought forward. We have low consumer demand. We have interest rates at 1%, one-third of where they were at emergency levels. And what\u2019s the government\u2019s response? The government\u2019s response is to talk about everything being a test for Labor. The fact is Scott Morrison won the election on May 18. He needs to stop acting like an opposition in exile on the government benches and actually develop a plan to deal with the economic challenges that Australia is facing. Any website still showing footage from the Christchurch attack will be taken down today. From Paul Fletcher\u2019s office: The eSafety Commissioner has today issued a direction to Australia\u2019s largest internet service providers requiring them to continue blocking access to eight websites that host video of the Christchurch terrorist attacks or the manifesto of the alleged perpetrator. Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher, said that keeping Australians safe from this type of horrific content is a key priority for the Morrison Government. \u201cAustralian internet service providers acted quickly and responsibly in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Christchurch in March this year to block websites that were hosting this harmful material,\u201d Minister Fletcher said. \u201cISPs called on the Government to provide them with certainty and clarity in taking the action they did, and today, we are providing that certainty.\u201d The eSafety Commissioner has consulted with the specific website administrators, providing them with the opportunity to remove this content. Most have complied and the eight remaining offending websites will be subject to the blocking directive. The crossbench are certainly making themselves known this parliament. In case you haven\u2019t seen it, Christopher Knaus has written about Rex Patrick\u2019s aim to have the Timor-Leste situation addressed: The crossbench senator Rex Patrick will push to fix a historic wrong stemming from the \u201cshameful\u201d treatment of Timor-Leste during oil and gas negotiations by overturning decisions that limit Australia\u2019s exposure to international courts. In 2002, the then Howard government decided to limit Australia\u2019s acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the international court of justice and international tribunal for the law of the sea. The government was at the time involved in sensitive maritime boundary negotiations with Timor-Leste that would split the lucrative oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea. The move effectively shielded Australia from cases lodged in the international courts about maritime boundary disputes, denying Timor-Leste an avenue of recourse it enjoyed under international law. Speaking of Jacqui Lambie, you may have seen a bit around this morning saying that she is going to support the government\u2019s welfare legislation \u2013 the cashless debit card and the drug testing. It\u2019s not so cut and dry as that though. The senator has been in support of the cashless debit card for some communities but hasn\u2019t made her mind up on a national rollout, as Rob Harris for Nine newspapers previously reported Scott Morrison was eyeing off, for the future. And, on drug testing, she still wants to look through the legislation proposal. Plus, she wants the same proposed drug testing regime put in place for public servants and MPs. A spokeswoman for the senator told me this morning: Jacqui is supportive of the card but she doesn\u2019t immediately support a national rollout and there are still tweaks that need to be made. Welcome back to parliament! It\u2019s been five weeks or so since we last gathered on the hill and we can expect all the greatest hits, including \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d, \u201cHow good is ... \u201d, \u201cJust how safe are you?\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s Labor\u2019s fault despite not being in power for the last six years\u201d and more. I. Can\u2019t. Wait. What happened during the break? Not a lot. Which is why we are back with cashless welfare card, drug testing welfare recipients and tough on crime. The government want to wedge Labor on mandatory sentencing. Labor hasn\u2019t made up its mind on that one yet but really wants to talk about the economy \u2013 the one thing the government doesn\u2019t really want to talk about. Newspoll is out, but I am not sure if anyone is paying attention to polling just yet \u2013 you can find the results here, but Anthony Albanese\u2019s personal popularity didn\u2019t come off too great. Again, I am not sure if anyone is really paying attention to that right now. Meanwhile, the Greens and the crossbench are continuing to lead the charge on a federal corruption watchdog \u201cwith teeth\u201d. Speaking of the crossbench, it is the Jacqui Lambie show right now. The Tassie senator had the deal she struck with the government \u2013 wiping Tasmania\u2019s federal housing debt in exchange for her support for the tax cuts \u2013 confirmed at the weekend but she is crucial for quite a few upcoming votes. One of them, the ensuring integrity bill, comes down to her and, as she told the Guardian late yesterday, she\u2019ll vote for it if the CFMMEU boss John Setka doesn\u2019t step down. Stay tuned. You have me and Mike Bowers, as well as Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and the rest of the Guardian brains trust. I still need a coffee, so I am working on that.",

      "bodyText": "Every day six young Australians are institutionalised in the aged care system because there is nowhere else they can go to receive the care they need. The aged care royal commission is sitting in Melbourne this week and is turning its attention to people aged under 65 in nursing homes. The cohort is made up of people who have lifelong disabilities, life-limiting illnesses or who acquire disabilities as a result of traumatic injuries. Counsel assisting the commission, Peter Rozen, characterised the group as largely \u201cunseen and lost Australians\u201d who deserve better. \u201cEvery week on average in Australia 42 younger Australians enter aged care. Six per day. Two thousand per year. By the time we return from [lunch] today, one more younger person can be expected to have become a resident in an aged care facility,\u201d Rozen told the hearing. Nursing homes are supposed to be the last resort for young people, but that\u2019s not the case in practice. Lisa Corcoran, 43, who has an acquired brain injury, gave evidence to the hearing with the help of a speech pathologist. She has been living in a nursing home for six years and said she was given no choice in the matter when she was discharged from hospital. \u201cThe staff just bundled up my clothing and moved me \u2013 they didn\u2019t even tell me where I was going,\u201d she said. Her number one life goal was to \u201cget the fuck out of the nursing home.

She is also upset about not getting a choice about what clothes she wears each day. Corcoran said it was traumatic to see people dying all around her and recently there had been six deaths in a fortnight. \u201cI saw one body being moved. I saw his head in a red bag. This was at 12pm when everyone was eating lunch,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day my room was getting painted and I had to go out of my room and into the common area.

Her only visitor is her brother. She detailed the humiliation of having an elderly man with dementia walk into her bathroom when she was having a shower. Another time staff forgot they had left her in the sun and she was severely burnt. Corcoran is waiting to move into new accommodation under the National Disability Insurance Scheme by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Catherine Roche from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches detailed the experience of how her late husband Michael\u2019s stroke at the age of 56 had forced him into the aged care system because of a shortage of places in rehabilitation units. \u201cEverything I looked into ended up being a dead end,\u201d she said. Roche slammed the inadequate rehabilitation therapy, lack of socialisation and age-appropriate leisure activities on offer for her husband at the nursing home, which caused him to emotionally withdraw. She was forced to pay for private physiotherapy sessions three times a week at a cost of $2,000 per month. \u201cAlthough Michael had physical disabilities and his speech was compromised, his cognition was still quite good. I could communicate with Michael verbally because I understood his speech patterns,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that staff at the residential aged care facility treated him as if he had dementia because they did not understand what he was saying.\u201d He couldn\u2019t go on outings because two staff members were required to help move him because he was 1.9m tall.

      "bodyText": "\ufeffFrom afar, it resembles a tornado: an immense grey column shooting thousands of feet upwards from the forest canopy into the Amazonian skies. Up close it is an inferno: a raging conflagration obliterating yet another stretch of the world\u2019s greatest rainforest as a herd of Nelore cattle looks on in bewilderment. \u201cIt started this morning,\u201d said Valdir Urumon, the chief of an indigenous village in this isolated corner of Rond\u00f4nia state, as the vast pillar of smoke loomed over his settlement\u2019s palm-thatched homes. By late afternoon, when the Guardian arrived on the scene, the fire had intensified into a catastrophic blaze, streaking north through a strip of jungle perhaps two miles long. Huge plumes of smoke drifted skywards as if this sweep of woodland near Brazil\u2019s north-western border with Bolivia had been subjected to a ferocious bombing campaign. At the farmhouse nearest to the blaze the lights were on but not a soul was to be seen \u2013 much less anyone who might extinguish the giant pyre. But two empty petrol barrels and a cluster of plastic jerrycans dumped at its entrance hinted at a possible culprit \u2013 a cattle rancher torching yet another swath of the Brazilian jungle in order to expand his Amazon domain. Three weeks after Brazil\u2019s unusually severe burning season sparked an international storm, the far-right government of Jair Bolsonaro has launched a global PR campaign to try to convince the world everything is under control. \u201cThe Amazon is not burning, not burning at all,\u201d Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, insisted in an interview with CNN. Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s governor, the Bolsonaro ally Marcos Rocha, took an identical line, dismissing the \u201cfuss\u201d over the fires as a foreign ruse to shackle Brazil\u2019s economy. Rocha, a retired police colonel, said: \u201cIf we look at the situation in other countries, their forests are burning much more than here in our Brazil. You go to London, or other countries, and what do you see? \u201cIt\u2019s not fog \u2013 it\u2019s smoke! Smoke from burning; from industry. So how can they demand of us what they haven\u2019t done themselves?\u201d Jo\u00e3o Chris\u00f3stomo, a Bolsonarian congressman in Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s capital, Porto Velho, rejected claims that Brazil was entering a new era of Amazon devastation and insisted \u2013 contrary to a growing body of evidence \u2013 that conservation was a top priority in Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil. Statistics produced by Brazil\u2019s own space institute \u2013 whose director was sacked last month after clashing with Bolsonaro \u2013 show deforestation has surged in recent months with a Manhattan-sized area lost every day in July. But Chris\u00f3stomo maintained Bolsonaro was \u201cmaking every effort to stop unbridled deforestation\u201d and chastised European leaders, such as Emmanuel Macron, who have questioned Bolsonaro\u2019s vision for the Amazon. Chris\u00f3stomo seethed: \u201cHe\u2019s not Brazil\u2019s president. He\u2019s not even from the Americas. This forest isn\u2019t shared, as he claims. It belongs to a nation which enjoys complete autonomy and authority to decide what happens to the forest and takes every possible care to preserve it.\u201d That last claim rang hollow this week as the Guardian travelled almost 2,000km by road and river through two of the Amazon states worst affected by this year\u2019s fires, Rond\u00f4nia and Amazonas. Along the way, an almost identical refrain emerged from the mouths of indigenous leaders, wildcat goldminers, environmental activists and government officials: that Bolsonaro\u2019s stripping back of protections and anti-environmental rhetoric had contributed to the scale of the fires \u2013 more than 30,000 of which were recorded in August alone \u2013 and set in motion a new age of wrecking that looks set to continue beyond the end of the annual burning season next month. \u201cIt is chaos. Chaos, chaos, chaos,\u201d lamented one senior official from Brazil\u2019s environmental agency, Ibama, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIf we go on like this, things will get worse and worse,\u201d predicted the official, diplomatically blaming the spike in Amazon deforestation during Bolsonaro\u2019s first eight months in power on the \u201cpolitical situation\u201d in Brazil. Life has never been easy for the activists and government agents seeking to slow rainforest destruction in a vast region many still call Brazil\u2019s \u201cfaroeste\u201d (wild west). In the riverside town of Humait\u00e1 in Amazonas state, Ibama\u2019s former headquarters lies in ruins two years after it was stormed, ransacked and burned to the ground by illegal goldminers in retribution for a crackdown. Now, as the dismantling of Brazil\u2019s environmental protection system gathers pace, its operations there are to halt altogether. Three regional Ibama offices \u2013 in Humait\u00e1, Parintins and Tabatinga \u2013 are in the process of being deactivated, leaving only one central command post in the capital, Manaus, to tackle environmental crime in a state three times the size of Spain. In a recent letter to Ibama\u2019s new president, several hundred officials voiced \u201cimmense concern\u201d over the direction environmental protection was taking. M\u00e1rcio Tenharim, an indigenous leader from a reserve near Humait\u00e1, said he feared the influx of soy farmers, ranchers and mining companies would accelerate as Brazil\u2019s president pushed for such activities to be allowed on previously protected areas. \u201cWe aren\u2019t ready for this,\u201d said Tenharim, predicting such \u201cdevelopment\u201d would bring \u201cnothing but misery\u201d for his people. Bolsonaro denies that will be the case \u2013 and many in the region see his Amazon blueprint as a boon. \u201cHe\u2019s our hope for improvement,\u201d said Martins Tavares, 33, a goldminer who said he and virtually all of his colleagues backed Bolsonaro, believing his promises to open up the Amazon would help them feed their families. Rui Souza, the owner of waterside petrol station in Humait\u00e1 that sells to goldseekers, said he was also optimistic Bolsonaro would do away with environmental and indigenous reserves so they could be commercially exploited. \u201cOur Amazonia is so rich, my friend.

      "body": "<p>Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have sought to present a united front in an attempt to ward off a potential war in Yemen between their surrogate armies.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government was ousted last month from key areas in the south by UAE-supported southern separatists, exposing simmering divisions between the two Middle East allies, who are fighting a joint campaign against the Iran-linked Houthi rebels.</p> <p>In a joint statement released by both countries\u2019 state media on Sunday, the Gulf powers \u201creaffirmed continued support for the legitimate government of Yemen\u201d and called on warring parties to immediately cease \u201call military operations\u201d and \u201cstop media propaganda\u201d that fuels hostilities.</p> <p>There is little guarantee that the joint Saudi-UAE appeal, made following four days of talks in Jeddah, will be heeded on the ground in Aden, the scene of the worst fighting.</p> <p>The dispute over southern Yemen\u2019s future is severely straining the normally close relations between the two great Gulf monarchies, and reflects the reality that the two countries probably have always had different strategic interests in their five-year intervention in Yemen.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have sought to present a united front in an attempt to ward off a potential war in Yemen between their surrogate armies. Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government was ousted last month from key areas in the south by UAE-supported southern separatists, exposing simmering divisions between the two Middle East allies, who are fighting a joint campaign against the Iran-linked Houthi rebels. In a joint statement released by both countries\u2019 state media on Sunday, the Gulf powers \u201creaffirmed continued support for the legitimate government of Yemen\u201d and called on warring parties to immediately cease \u201call military operations\u201d and \u201cstop media propaganda\u201d that fuels hostilities. There is little guarantee that the joint Saudi-UAE appeal, made following four days of talks in Jeddah, will be heeded on the ground in Aden, the scene of the worst fighting. The dispute over southern Yemen\u2019s future is severely straining the normally close relations between the two great Gulf monarchies, and reflects the reality that the two countries probably have always had different strategic interests in their five-year intervention in Yemen. It is not clear if the statement is intended merely to paper over continuing divisions or will lead to an end to the fighting by the respective surrogate forces. The sudden fracture has increased the confusion in Washington\u2019s Gulf strategy, complicating its Iran policy. In addition to forcing changes in the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Yemen, including the possible division of the country, the split may also damage the standing of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Washington. The dispute in the south started soon after UAE announced two months ago that it was unilaterally pulling most of its troops out of Yemen after more than four years of fighting, leaving its chief coalition partner, Saudi Arabia, and indigenous Yemeni government forces to continue the war against the Houthis. In mid-August, fighters from UAE-backed southern separatist movement, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), seized power in Aden, ousting the forces backed by Saudi Arabia and led by President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Now living in exile, Hadi, who was overthrown by the Houthis in 2014, is still recognised by the UN as the legitimate ruler of Yemen. Saudi has threatened to react decisively against the STC to reinstate Hadi\u2019s rule. The STC, and its precursors before its May 2017 formation, have long campaigned for the restoration of South Yemen\u2019s independence from the North, or at minimum a federal structure. The country was unified in 1990. The eruption of fighting in the south has severely complicated UN efforts to start talks between the Houthis and the Yemen government. The dispute means the Iranian-backed Houthis that control both Yemen\u2019s capital Sana\u2019a and the north of the country have found themselves under reduced military pressure. At the same time it has become increasingly visible that the Saudis and UAE have different priorities in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has been intent on weakening the Houthi rebels in the north, fearing an Iranian presence on its own borders joining Yemen while the UAE\u2019s interests focus on ensuring the southern port of Aden does not come under Houthi control, thereby imperilling shipping lanes through Bab al-Mandab, upon which Emirati interests depend heavily. The dominance of the STC in the south could be enough to achieve these UAE aims, but at the expense of splitting the country in two.",

While fish deaths have occurred in the past, the scale was unprecedented and stunned Australians.</p> <p>Several scientific reports said the lack of flow in the river due to the drought and exacerbated by irrigation upstream were to blame. When temperatures soared to over 40C and were followed by a cool change, the water in the pools stratified, leading to deoxygenation of the deeper water, killing fish.</p> <p>But there are already doubts about how effective the $10m program will be.</p> <p>The unprecedented operation aims to move as many fish as possible from 15 to 20 priority waterholes in a two-week period, including Murray cod, some of which are at least 25 years old, golden perch and other rare species.</p> <p>Boats with electrostatic fishing equipment will be used to stun the fish in weir pools and waterholes along the Darling at Menindee, where they will scooped up and loaded into special climate-controlled transport to a section of the Darling further south, near Wentworth, where the river joins the Murray, which is still flowing.</p> <p>Department of Primary Industries fisheries scientists are targeting fish contained within drying pools that are not expected to last through the summer.</p> <p>\u201cBy moving these fish, such as Murray cod and golden perch, we\u2019re providing the best possible chance of survival,\u201d Marshall said.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the government has not said how many fish it will move.

The NSW agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, said the unprecedented action would provide \u201ca lifeline for key native species ahead of an expected summer of horror fish kills\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re staring down the barrel of a potential fish Armageddon, which is why we\u2019re wasting little time rolling out this unprecedented action,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBy starting this operation today we\u2019re getting on the front foot while we still have the chance to rescue and relocate as many fish as possible.\u201d Last December and January fish began dying in their hundreds of thousands in the far west of the state at Menindee, leaving weirs and waterholes carpeted with dead fish. While fish deaths have occurred in the past, the scale was unprecedented and stunned Australians. Several scientific reports said the lack of flow in the river due to the drought and exacerbated by irrigation upstream were to blame. When temperatures soared to over 40C and were followed by a cool change, the water in the pools stratified, leading to deoxygenation of the deeper water, killing fish. But there are already doubts about how effective the $10m program will be. The unprecedented operation aims to move as many fish as possible from 15 to 20 priority waterholes in a two-week period, including Murray cod, some of which are at least 25 years old, golden perch and other rare species. Boats with electrostatic fishing equipment will be used to stun the fish in weir pools and waterholes along the Darling at Menindee, where they will scooped up and loaded into special climate-controlled transport to a section of the Darling further south, near Wentworth, where the river joins the Murray, which is still flowing. Department of Primary Industries fisheries scientists are targeting fish contained within drying pools that are not expected to last through the summer. \u201cBy moving these fish, such as Murray cod and golden perch, we\u2019re providing the best possible chance of survival,\u201d Marshall said. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the government has not said how many fish it will move. One source told the Guardian it was hoped it would be in the hundreds. This is just a fraction of the population of the river and will not prevent the likelihood of further mass fish deaths during the coming summer. \u201cIt\u2019s a photo-op rather than a real deal,\u201d said a Menindee local, Graeme McCrabb, who has become a spokesman for the local community on the lower Darling. \u201cThere would be 10,000 cod between Weir 32 [at Menindee] and the Murray,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd silver perch, listed as a vulnerable species, are difficult to catch with electro fishing.\u201d \u201cIf Lake Wetherill goes, there will be even more fish die than last year,\u201d McCrabb warned. A program last summer to install aerators in larger waterholes near Menindee, which aimed to stir the water and restore oxygen, was only marginally successful due to the size of the pools and the vast length of the river. Meanwhile, the NSW government appears to be in denial about possible causes of the ecological catastrophe last summer. The water minister, Melinda Pavey, has criticised her own independent adviser, the NSW Natural Resources Commission, which said extractions by irrigators upstream may have led to the Lower Darling being pushed into hydrological drought three years earlier than it otherwise would have been. The commission has called for an urgent revision of the rules that allow irrigators to continue to extract from the river when flows are very low. It wants the threshold when irrigators must cease to take water from the river to be raised, along with other rule changes. \u201cThe NRC report was one of a number that has given advice on this issue,\u201d said Sheldon, who contributed to the report. \u201cIt\u2019s a contentious issue. We just raised the question: have [the extraction rules] influenced the conditions that have led to the catastrophic drying of the Barwon-Darling?\u201d \u201cIf the answer is that extractions did contribute, then the answer is straightforward: we need to change the rules. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t, then the answer is a whole lot more complex. We need to understand what is really going on.\u201d \u201cThe fish rescue program will preserve some genetic diversity, but the government also needs to monitor the surrounding ecosystems, as [returning] fish would not survive if mussels and other invertebrates are lost,\u201d she said. The government said the fish would be able to migrate back up the 500km of the Darling when the drought ended. \u201cWhen flows do return to normal, the fish will be able to migrate to their \u2018homes\u2019 back upstream, without the need for additional intervention,\u201d Marshall said. \u2022 On 10 September 2019 this article was amended. A previous version said water in pools \u201cstriated\u201d when \u201cstratified\u201d was meant.",

      "body": "<p>In January 2009 I had lunch in Moscow with the oligarch Alexander Lebedev. There were reports that Lebedev wanted to buy London\u2019s loss-making <em>Evening Standard</em> newspaper and that negotiations had broken down. Over pasta with octopus, Lebedev told me talks with Lord Rothermere were going well. \u201cI\u2019m buying the <em>Standard</em> on Thursday,\u201d he added nonchalantly.</p> <p>It was, by any standards, a pretty decent scoop. The story wrote itself: former Russian spy who spent the 1980s at the Soviet embassy in London becomes British media mogul. Or as one headline put it: \u201cI\u2019m from the KGB! Give me your papers!\u201d A year later, Lebedev acquired the <em>Independent</em> titles and launched the mini <em>i</em>, his son, Evgeny, installed as gentleman proprietor.</p> <p>What prompted Lebedev\u2019s foray into the British media? Lebedev told me he valued the importance of a free press, especially its role in exposing corruption. He was disdainful about other super-rich Russians, amusingly so. They were a bunch of greedy, uncultured, semi-literate yobs who thought the only way to impress was to buy a big yacht.</p> <p>Lebedev explores these themes in <em>Hunt the Banker</em>, his entertaining and wildly self-indulgent account of his life and career in Russia. Of billionaires, he writes: \u201cThey have lacklustre eyes, look abysmal and have a toxic personality and an off-putting physical appearance.\u201d Money leads to bad habits, including \u201cpaying girls for their services\u201d. \u201cA sin I too have been guilty of,\u201d he admits.</p> <p>As Lebedev tells it, his fortune was made honestly, through talent and endeavour. He grew up in a two-room flat in Moscow, father an engineer, mother an English teacher, and queued with everyone else for Soviet cheese and sausage. In his final year at university he was approached by \u201cheadhunters\u201d from a mysterious organisation: KGB foreign intelligence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem is, Lebedev says nothing about Putin, the person who sits at the top of Russia\u2019s mafia state</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lebedev, of course, joined up.

The bad guys ultimately prevail. By 2012, Lebedev had been dispossessed of most of his empire \u2013 his stake in Aeroflot, his budget airline and his bank depositors, scared away after FSB goons in balaclavas raided his office.

Ultimately, though, the book rings hollow. There\u2019s nothing wrong with his analysis of global corruption, and of the trillion dollars stolen annually in the developing world and elsewhere, and hidden in offshore accounts, often by western fixers. The problem is, Lebedev says nothing about Putin, the person who sits at the top of Russia\u2019s mafia state.</p> <p>Lebedev understands perfectly the rules of the game, as played by Russia\u2019s elite.

Nor can you point out that Putin\u2019s mates, judo partners and St Petersburg <em>dacha</em> neighbours have become multi-billionaires, their business projects blessed as if by a divine wind.</p> <p>My last breakfast with Lebedev was a testy affair.

      "bodyText": "In the vast jungles that cover the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the world\u2019s most invisible health crises burns on. The country\u2019s extensive equatorial forests are home to numerous species of venomous snakes, but their habitat is shared by secluded communities that are being forced to look further and further afield for their resources due to poverty and the pressures of conflict and climate change. It puts DRC at the centre of an issue M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has called a \u201cneglected crisis\u201d: death by snake bite. Globally, about 5m snake bites occur worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization, resulting in between 81,000 and 138,000 deaths. A bite from a viper, cobra or mamba can kill in a matter of hours or leave a victim suffering life-changing injury. Symptoms of snakebite envenomation commonly include tissue necrosis, intense pain and nausea. Beyond treatments that provide symptomatic relief, specialised antidotes are vital in counteracting the venom. Venom from the atheris viper causes intense pain and haemorrhage; no specific anti-venom exists. The forest cobra produces a neurotoxic venom that causes shock, fever, dizziness, pain, paralysis and respiratory issues. Since the deadliest snakes often share habitats with rural populations that lack adequate healthcare, the victims of this crisis are often underprivileged people with no access to anti-venoms. DRC\u2019s remote tropical forests provide the perfect habitat for the country\u2019s venomous species, but they also make essential medical intervention nearly impossible. Patrick Atelo displays a live mamba on his fishing spear on the river Ruki after it had been spotted too close for comfort to the village. \u201cThe river is the gateway to finding many of them,\u201d explains Fran\u00e7ois Nsingi, a technical assistant with the University of Kinshasa\u2019s centre for anti-venom. The Congo river and its tributaries are a key habitat for venomous species, he says, as snakes hunt for fish and birds along the banks. Fran\u00e7ois Nsingi, a technician at the University of Kinshasa\u2019s centre for anti-venom research. Nsingi keeps snakes for use in DRC\u2019s severely underfunded anti-venom programme. Snakes are rare around Kinshasa, he says, but heading down to the waters of the Congo and deeper into the bush, interactions between snakes and humans are far more common \u2013 as are problems. While death after a snakebite is not inevitable, lack of knowledge regarding basic treatments and poor access to anti-venom means that venomous snakes pose a severe threat to remote communities, especially those whose daily work by rivers and fields places them in snake habitats. DRC\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and lack of funding is the biggest obstacle to adequate in-country anti-venom production, with extremely limited stocks of anti-venom imported from Mexico available in the capital, but totally inaccessible in the rest of the huge nation. In the office of the anti-venom centre, Sophie Bokuta, the secretary of operations, explains the reality of local scientific work: \u201cAt this time we don\u2019t have the money to produce serums or to distribute them around the country \u2026 we are researching some international funds to get work back ahead and raise the Congo office up\u201d. In comparison, countries such as Costa Rica and India, with comparable dangerous snake species in their ecosystems, have advanced programmes for studying venom and producing antidotes.

A cobra inside a fishing trap on the river Rukie. \u201cThe poison affected my whole body,\u201d Monique Dongo recounts, \u201cI could barely remember who I was.\u201d Dongo, bitten while inspecting her rural property, is a survivor of envenomation. While she was lucky, she has seen snakebites kill others, including members of her own family. Monique Dongo, who survived after being bitten by a snake while walking in the bush. Her young nephew began to vomit and faint after he was bitten while playing outdoors, and passed away just hours later. Due to the inaccessibility of anti-venom, many people in DRC rely on traditional healers. The remedies provided by these healers include making cuts, using charred powders and constricting wounds. These practices can be harmful. Functional infrastructure is the first step to a solution, but a more realistic sense of the scale of the problem is also required. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any [local] data on snakebites,\u201d says Dr Guy Kalambayi of the World Health Organization\u2019s \u00c9quateur office. \u201cIf we had facts \u2026 then we could resolve the situation\u201d. The logistics and terrain of much of DRC means snakebites often go unrecorded. Given the ultra-specialised medicines required, template methods for dealing with a tropical health crisis can\u2019t simply be deployed here. Bienvenue Efete, a healer, collects a herb he uses in his traditional remedy for snakebites. Right; Dr Anaurite Nyaboleka at her health clinic in Mbandaka. Blandine Yoyani, a traditional healer in Mbandaka, shows her remedy for snakebites. Herbs and a snake head are ground into powder then burned before being rubbed into a small razor cuts made on the arms of a snakebite victim. DRC, with it\u2019s barely functional state system, is an extreme example. But with national and international health aid overstretched, this issue is a global one, found wherever tropical forests and rural communities overlap. Jose Lisisa, 10, clears foliage and wood around his village on the outskirts of Mbandaka. This story was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHowever rebellious children may be, they have their parents\u2019 genes; American radicals are Americans,\u201d wrote the late radical writer Andrew Kopkind in the New York Times in 1968. \u201cThey cannot easily cross class lines to organize groups above or below their own station. They are caught in the same status traps as everyone else, even if they react self-consciously.\u201d What is true for class also goes for race, gender, age and a range of other affiliations: the American left are the products of the very society they are trying to change. As Trump has targeted women, black people, Latinos, Muslims and immigrants \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 so those groups have rallied and are asserting themselves while others, within the progressive coalition, have become more sensitized to their condition. When they look to a party, and indeed a candidate, they want to see someone who will challenge the reactionary rhetoric and policies that have come from the White House. This forces conversations and, at time, confrontations that have always been present on the left, but rarely quite so acute. This has already become evident among presidential contenders in early primary clashes whether it be over Joe Biden\u2019s intrusively tactile manner and history of opposing bussing, Pete Buttigeig\u2019s mishandling of the police shooting of a black man in his home town or Bernie Sanders inability to sufficiently appeal to African Americans in 2016.

      "body": "<p>The first-ever strike by British Airways pilots started at midnight on Sunday night, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and travel disruption for thousands of passengers.</p> <p>Members of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) have said they will walk out for 48 hours in a long-running dispute over pay, with a further strike set for 27 September if the row remains unresolved.</p> <p>On Monday morning BA said on its website that it had \u201cno option but to cancel nearly 100% (0f) our flights\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand the frustration and disruption BALPA\u2019s strike action has caused you. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this,\u201d the company\u2019s website said.</p> <p>Both BA and Balpa have indicated that they are willing to start new talks. Despite the slight thaw in previously tetchy relations, the vast majority of BA\u2019s flights taking off from the UK on Monday and Tuesday have already been cancelled.</p> <p>BA has told passengers that if they have a flight booked on Monday and Tuesday, it is likely they will not be able to travel as planned.</p> <p>BA operates more than 800 flights a day, with most expected to be cancelled, affecting up to 145,000 passengers each day.</p> <p>Customers have been offered refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or alternative airline.

      "bodyText": "The first-ever strike by British Airways pilots started at midnight on Sunday night, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and travel disruption for thousands of passengers. Members of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) have said they will walk out for 48 hours in a long-running dispute over pay, with a further strike set for 27 September if the row remains unresolved. On Monday morning BA said on its website that it had \u201cno option but to cancel nearly 100% (0f) our flights\u201d. \u201cWe understand the frustration and disruption BALPA\u2019s strike action has caused you. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. Both BA and Balpa have indicated that they are willing to start new talks. Despite the slight thaw in previously tetchy relations, the vast majority of BA\u2019s flights taking off from the UK on Monday and Tuesday have already been cancelled. BA has told passengers that if they have a flight booked on Monday and Tuesday, it is likely they will not be able to travel as planned. BA operates more than 800 flights a day, with most expected to be cancelled, affecting up to 145,000 passengers each day. Customers have been offered refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or alternative airline. It is expected that the problems will continue after the strike, because planes and pilots will need to be in position for subsequent journeys. Balpa\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cBritish Airways needs to wake up and realise its pilots are determined to be heard. \u201cThey\u2019ve previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits. \u201cThe company\u2019s leaders, who themselves are paid huge salaries and have generous benefits packages, won\u2019t listen, are refusing to negotiate and are putting profits before the needs of passengers and staff. It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute,\u201d he said. BA has offered an 11.5% pay rise over three years, which it said would take the pay of some captains to more than \u00a3200,000 a year. The airline said it believed the pay offer was \u201cfair and generous\u201d, and that it if it was good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers \u2013 whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it \u2013 it should be good enough for pilots. A Balpa statement said: \u201cFundamentally, BA pilots have lost trust and confidence in their management through relentless cost and corner-cutting.\u201d One pilot told the Guardian on Friday: \u201cIt\u2019s not really about money, it\u2019s about respect. We\u2019ve effectively been lied to. We\u2019ve given up a serious pension scheme, pay and pay rises when the company was weak \u2013 all on the promise that when the company was strong and giving up proper returns to its investors, we would benefit.\u201d \u00c1lex Cruz, the company\u2019s chief executive, is currently paid \u00a31.3m. In August BA\u2019s parent firm, IAG, reported a 20% rise in its pre-tax second-quarter profit. In 2018 it reported annual profits of \u20ac2.9bn (\u00a32.6bn). The strike is the latest blow for passengers at an airline that once called itself the \u201cworld\u2019s favourite\u201d but has looked increasingly accident-prone. The fragility of BA\u2019s IT security was laid bare last year when hackers stole the personal data of half a million customers, a breach that led to a \u00a3183m fine. In July a computer systems glitch meant that more than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed, causing problems for tens of thousands of passengers. In 2017 a power cut left 75,000 passengers stranded. Pilots and crew said they were left to deal with the fallout, which went on for several days. The Civil Aviation Authority has said passengers have a legal right to a replacement flight at BA\u2019s expense to get them to their destination, even if this means travelling with a different airline.",

Ian Robertson, lawyer at Holding Redlich, was given the chance on Monday to respond to extraordinary accusations that he advised New South Wales Labor boss, Kaila Murnain, to keep quiet about unlawful donations in September 2016.

There are still 52 fires burning across the state. Schools are closed and about 20 structures have been destroyed. Early on Sunday morning, a fire front climbed into the Lamington national park and razed Binna Burra, a historic eco-tourism lodge built in the 1930s and surrounded by subtropical Gondwana rainforest.

A year later, and again conditions are being described in similar terms, the sort that can fuel catastrophic wildfires. Southeast Queensland has been particularly dry; the fire-threatened town of Stanthorpe is almost out of drinking water. In Lamington national park, the rainforest has had very little recent rain.

The last weekend in September sees the Fuente de las Batallas fountain in the city centre transformed. Stalls run by local farmers are piled high with seasonal fruit. Quinces emit a subtle fragrance across the square. Vendors sell local pomegranates, jujube berries and acerolas. Local chestnuts are roasted on street corners. Torta de la Virgen pastries are also a delicious tradition at this festival. Only available that week, they are baked by local nuns and filled with sweet pumpkin. In the festival\u2019s religious activities, locals line up to place bunches of flowers on the facade of the church, covering it entirely. An incense-swathed procession through the city streets closes the celebrations.<br><strong>Molly Sears-Piccavey, <a href=\"https://www.piccavey.com/\" title=\"\">Piccavey.com</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Market restaurant, </strong>N\u00eemes, France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546e0030df0d62d6d122e2781d6c24b0ac0ed74d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/546e0030df0d62d6d122e2781d6c24b0ac0ed74d/128_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La Pie qui couette market restaurant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">La Pie qui Couette serves dishes of food from the surrounding market stalls</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until a few years ago, a stroll through Les Halles de N\u00eemes could be very frustrating. Viewing the spectacular produce on sale \u2013 including sweet C\u00e9vennes onions and iridescent pink <em>rougets</em> \u2013 made one yearn for a place to sample it all. This is why chef Emmanuel Leblay\u2019s 25-seat counter restaurant, <strong>La Pie qui Couette</strong>, has been a hit since it opened in late 2015. Leblay changes his menu daily according to what he finds while shopping at the surrounding stalls. Certain dishes, however, have become classics, including a hand-chopped steak tartare and a luscious <em>brandade</em> <em>de morue</em>, a N\u00eemes speciality, here made with salt cod, Camargue potatoes, olive oil and organic lemon zest. He also pours an excellent selection of local wines, and after finishing with some fresh apricot soup or chocolate mousse, you\u2019ll understand why this place is called the Jabbering Magpie; these birds can get noisy after they\u2019ve eaten and drunk well. <br>\u2022 <em>Main</em><em>s from \u20ac14-35, 5 rue des Halles, </em><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/la.pie.qui.couette\" title=\"\">on Facebook</a></em><em>, </em><em>11.30am-3pm, Tues- Sun,</em><em> no reservations<br></em><strong><a href=\"https://www.alexanderlobrano.com/\" title=\"\">Alexander Lobrano</a>, author of Hungry for Paris and France</strong></p> <h2>Full-on feast, Georgia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae58f02be4c63bcd5a0e9047edeb957bb7728baf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae58f02be4c63bcd5a0e9047edeb957bb7728baf/0_42_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lobio Baia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Lobio</em> (spiced beans) is a Baia speciality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommo J Williams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At <strong>Baia\u2019s </strong><strong>vineyard</strong>, outside Kutaisi, Georgia\u2019s third largest city, rustic tables look out on thousands of vines backed by rolling hills.

      "bodyText": "Festival of autumn fruits, Granada, Spain The arrival of autumn in Granada begins with the Virgen de las Angustias festivities. The last weekend in September sees the Fuente de las Batallas fountain in the city centre transformed. Stalls run by local farmers are piled high with seasonal fruit. Quinces emit a subtle fragrance across the square. Vendors sell local pomegranates, jujube berries and acerolas. Local chestnuts are roasted on street corners. Torta de la Virgen pastries are also a delicious tradition at this festival. Only available that week, they are baked by local nuns and filled with sweet pumpkin. In the festival\u2019s religious activities, locals line up to place bunches of flowers on the facade of the church, covering it entirely. An incense-swathed procession through the city streets closes the celebrations. Molly Sears-Piccavey, Piccavey.com Market restaurant, N\u00eemes, France Until a few years ago, a stroll through Les Halles de N\u00eemes could be very frustrating. Viewing the spectacular produce on sale \u2013 including sweet C\u00e9vennes onions and iridescent pink rougets \u2013 made one yearn for a place to sample it all. This is why chef Emmanuel Leblay\u2019s 25-seat counter restaurant, La Pie qui Couette, has been a hit since it opened in late 2015. Leblay changes his menu daily according to what he finds while shopping at the surrounding stalls. Certain dishes, however, have become classics, including a hand-chopped steak tartare and a luscious brandade de morue, a N\u00eemes speciality, here made with salt cod, Camargue potatoes, olive oil and organic lemon zest. He also pours an excellent selection of local wines, and after finishing with some fresh apricot soup or chocolate mousse, you\u2019ll understand why this place is called the Jabbering Magpie; these birds can get noisy after they\u2019ve eaten and drunk well. \u2022 Mains from \u20ac14-35, 5 rue des Halles, on Facebook, 11.30am-3pm, Tues- Sun, no reservations Alexander Lobrano, author of Hungry for Paris and France Full-on feast, Georgia At Baia\u2019s vineyard, outside Kutaisi, Georgia\u2019s third largest city, rustic tables look out on thousands of vines backed by rolling hills. The supra (Georgian feast) begins as a stream of homemade dishes are set in front of you. The food is accompanied by natural wine, created by Baia herself, a third-generation winemaker who started her own vineyard in 2015, aged 22, using 8,000-year-old techniques. You\u2019ll salivate at the khachapuri (cheese-stuffed bread), roasted village chicken with tkemali (sour plum sauce), lobio (spiced beans), and peppers stuffed with bazhe, Georgia\u2019s famous walnut paste, as you fill yourself to bursting point. Certainly an unforgettable experience. \u2022 Book Baia\u2019s meal and wine tasting (from \u00a311) on Facebook Megsy Williams, Food Fun Travel Food festival, Miranda do Douro, Portugal In remote north-east Portugal, the small historic town of Miranda do Douro has beautiful views of the Douro river across to Spain and rocky mountain cliffs. It\u2019s home of the second language of Portugal, mirand\u00e9s \u2013 and is famous for mirandesa beef, the churra breed of sheep and b\u00edsaro pork. All these take centre stage at Sabores Mirandeses Festival in February which highlights regional specialities, from local meats and traditional smoked sausages, to olive oil, almonds and bola doce (a multi-layered cake). It\u2019s a chance to learn about culinary traditions as well as the town\u2019s culture, with Pauliteiros folk dance displays among entertainment. \u2022 14-16 February 2020, free admission, cm-mdouro.pt C\u00e9lia Pedroso, head of Culinary Backstreets Lisbon and co-author of Eat Portugal The perfect sandwich, Porto, Portugal Tasca de Badalhoca is just a sandwich shop in Porto. Yet stepping through its heavy doors into the dimness within, felt like entering another world: a Porto of yesteryear (it\u2019s been open for 120 years). Nothing flashy, no nonsense \u2013 just great honest food costing practically nothing. It was 11.30am and everyone held glass mugs of bubbly pink espadal wine. Legs of dry-cured pork hung from the ceiling, the fast-talking staff were busy, the queue moving \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t decipher the taped-up menu. I managed to order three sandwiches: presunto (ham), eggs and presunto, and leit\u00e3o (roast suckling pig), plus a mug of wine. All of it perfection. I walked out giddy on something more than ros\u00e9 \u2013 I felt I\u2019d been immersed into something dear to Porto\u2019s heart, if only for a few minutes. \u2022 Rua Dr Alberto Macedo 437, on Facebook Laura Siciliano-Rosen, Eat Your World Oyster safari, Denmark Denmark may be famous for open sandwiches, but foodies know it\u2019s really all about the oysters. The Scandinavian country has two types of the marine delicacy. Head to northern Jutland for the slow-growing, native Limfjord oyster, which is celebrated for its texture and taste. (The area is a protected sea zone with stringent regulations applying to all fishing.) Or pack a bottle of bubbly and head to the Wadden Sea at Unesco-listed Vadehavscentret, south of Esbjerg, for a Pacific oyster buffet.

      "bodyText": "Top story: More resignations feared after Rudd\u2019s exit Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke. Boris Johnson will meet the Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, today in an attempt to show his Brexit plan still has relevance. But his push won\u2019t have been helped by the French government\u2019s threat yesterday to veto a further extension due to the \u201cworrying\u201d lack of progress in the recent talks. \u201cThe British must tell us what they want,\u201d the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said. On Johnson\u2019s return from Dublin, he\u2019s expected to make a second bid to trigger a 15 October general election by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. On what looks set to be a very busy day, the backbench bill aimed at blocking no-deal Brexit is also expected to receive royal assent. It will all take place in the shadow of Amber Rudd\u2019s departure, with fears other Tory moderates may follow suit. The Guardian understands that since tendering her resignation, Rudd has been approached by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers who have expressed concern about the direction of the government. With such high stakes, columnist John Harris asks why so many Brits are tuning out. \u201cAway from Brexit and the Tory melodrama, I\u2019ve found a mood of weariness and disconnection,\u201d he writes after visiting the north-west. You can stay up to date on all today\u2019s developments on our politics live blog. * * * Worcester Park fire \u2013 Firefighters have been battling a major blaze in south-west London in the early hours of this morning, with a four-storey block of flats engulfed in flames in Worcester Park. A total of 20 fire engines and some 125 firefighters were sent to the scene in Sherbrooke Way at around 1.30am after the fire broke out and quickly spread. The London ambulance service was also on the scene but said no injuries had been reported. * * * Taliban warning \u2013 More American lives will be lost in Afghanistan, the Taliban says, after Donald Trump cancelled peace talks that would have brought him face to face with the group\u2019s leaders. Trump said he \u201ccalled off\u201d the talks after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast in Kabul that killed 12 people, including a US soldier, on Thursday. The revelation that talks were even taking place prompted anger from both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organisation that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop,\u201d tweeted Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger. The Democratic presidential 2020 hopeful Amy Klobuchar said the president was approaching foreign policy like \u201csome kind of gameshow\u201d. * * * Carbon-neutral \u2018industrial cluster\u2019 \u2013 Energy companies have ignited multibillion-pound plans for the UK\u2019s first carbon-neutral \u201cindustrial cluster\u201d in the Humber. National Grid, Drax and Norway\u2019s state energy company, Equinor, are leading a campaign to shrink the carbon footprint of Britain\u2019s most polluting industrial zone by trialling world-leading technology to capture and store carbon emissions from factory and power plant flues before they enter the atmosphere. * * * MMR jabs \u2013 A group of leading GPs has called for the measles vaccination to be compulsory before children start primary school. In a letter to ministers, the four London GPs, who include a former government adviser on health policy, have urged the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to embrace the proposed change. Doing so would save lives and tackle dangerous \u201ccomplacency\u201d among parents who do not ensure that their child is fully immunised, they say. * * * India moon mission \u2013 The lander module from India\u2019s failed moon mission has been located. The mission, known as Chandrayaan-2, was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits that were confirmed by the Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008. The Indian space agency said it lost touch with the Vikram lunar lander on Saturday as it made its final approach to the moon\u2019s south pole to deploy a rover to search for signs of water. Today in Focus podcast: Why do Dubai\u2019s princesses keep trying to run away? Ola Salem discusses the divorce case of Princess Haya, who fled to London. Why do royal women keep trying to escape the emirate? Plus John Marsden on the growing trend of toxic parenting. Lunchtime read: \u2018My energy is back\u2019 Men who feel tired or drained are often told it\u2019s just a fact of life. But in some cases low testosterone is to blame, and there are treatments available. Robbie Williams is perhaps one of the best-known cases of low testosterone, after his wife, Ayda Field, revealed last year that when the singer had depression in his 30s, doctors found he had the testosterone levels of an 80-year-old man.

It is generally older men who are more commonly affected \u2013 as many as 10% of men aged 40 to 60 have low testosterone, increasing to one in five among those aged between 60 and 80. Sport Joe Root vowed to plough on as England\u2019s Test captain as he processed the raw emotion of seeing his side\u2019s bid to regain the Ashes evaporate with the 185-run defeat in Manchester. Afterwards, Australia captain Tim Paine offered a heavy nod towards \u201cthe best player we\u2019ve seen\u201d; it was always going to be tough for England given the genius of Steve Smith, but also the world\u2019s best pace attack.

Members of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) have said they will walk out for 48 hours, with a further strike set for 27 September if the row remains unresolved.

It was never luxurious, with cabins, a big fireplace in the reception lounge and access to a forest like no other. There\u2019s still only one road in, from the Gold Coast to the ridge of Beechmont and then, a single-lane final climb through eucalyptus forest to the edge of the rainforest. Often the place is shrouded in mist. Most years, it rains a lot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/09/like-nothing-weve-seen-queensland-bushfires-tear-through-rainforest\">'Like nothing we've seen': Queensland bushfires tear through rainforest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I first visited Binna Burra as a high school biology student 40 years ago, staying in the dorm accommodation at the campsite across from the main lodge. I had all the attitude of a damaged teen and a firm belief that nothing could surprise or move me. And yet, here it was, this place of giant trees and different air and light that changes minute to minute. The birds, the understory, the smell of it. I can\u2019t hope to make you understand. You\u2019d have to go there.</p> <p>I do not come from a hiking family \u2013 we never once visited a national park \u2013 but that first experience began for me a lifelong love affair with this national park in particular and national parks more generally. And what a gift it has been. Like a mother, the rainforest at Binna Burra takes you in its arms. In one way or another, I have been in those arms ever since.</p> <p>Binna Burra Lodge\u2019s bird-in-boots logo was possibly daggy when it was launched in the 70s, and it\u2019s even more daggy 50 years on. I say this with all due affection, an affection I know is shared by other visitors. They will have slept in bunk rooms with shared amenities or splurged on a cabin of their own with a bathroom. They might have spent rainy days in the upstairs \u201clibrary\u201d with its yellowed books donated by guests. They\u2019ll have enjoyed a pre-dinner drink (or cup of tea) while watching the sunset under massive gums on the terrace. They\u2019ll have eaten the fancy boarding school food in the dining room, supplies trucked up three times a week \u2013 hash browns at breakfast, three meats and a veggie option at dinner, soup in a massive tureen on each table with fresh baked bread. More recently, they might have stayed in the self-contained skylodges, less bluestone, less timber but still with that simplicity that admits the grandeur.</p> <p>And they\u2019ll have walked. They\u2019ll have taken a packed lunch of meats and salads and bread and fruit cake on the trail. They might have gone just a little way in, to Tullawallal, rewarded by the sight of those ancient Antarctic beech trees Binna Burra is named for. Even in an hour in the rainforest, they\u2019ve heard more birds and seen more trees than in a week in a city. They return to the lodge and the staff listen as they describe a lyrebird\u2019s call as if they are the first person who\u2019s ever heard it. Others may have walked more kilometres than they thought possible.</p> <p>Once, I went abseiling with a lodge group. We hiked out and crawled through narrow caves to drop down off the Shipstern and Turtle Rock, finishing in the evening at Natural Bridge to see the glow-worms. I\u2019m afraid of heights and small spaces. It didn\u2019t matter out there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24d109bcc7ec671a85357c08cd628080d4a53cf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24d109bcc7ec671a85357c08cd628080d4a53cf4/60_0_1955_1174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bushfire that ripped through the heritage-listed Binna Burra Lodge in the Gold Coast hinterland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bushfire that ripped through the heritage-listed Binna Burra Lodge in the Gold Coast hinterland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seven News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years, I have shied away from the lodge, preferring a campsite in the national park to a soft bed and conviviality. Perhaps I\u2019ve wanted time alone, grieving for the world, but now, I wish I\u2019d stayed at the lodge more often. You\u2019d look around the dining room at night and you\u2019d see it on the faces. It\u2019s wonder, the experience of awe. It\u2019s what nature gives us, a chance to be small, insignificant. At Binna Burra, you are gently encouraged to come to understand just how little you matter. And it\u2019s a relief.</p> <p>The fire was swift and out of control by Friday when the lodge was evacuated. On Saturday, no one could get in to fight it. It was a black dawn for Binna Burra\u2019s director and 70 staff on Sunday. The dining room is gone. The lodge cabins are all gone. Even the new sky lodges are devastated.</p> <p>Perhaps it was always written that this would happen. It has happened.

      "bodyText": "This is an obituary for quaint slab-wood cabins, a place that was burned down on the weekend in a fire devastating for the many thousands of people who have visited over the past 85 years. Binna Burra Lodge, in the world-heritage-listed rainforest of Lamington national park, has been destroyed by bushfire. Binna Burra was the environmental lodge started by conservationist and adventurer Arthur Groom and engineer Romeo Lahey (brother of artist Vida) in 1933 as a place for ordinary people to \u201cexperience the grandeur\u201d. It was never luxurious, with cabins, a big fireplace in the reception lounge and access to a forest like no other. There\u2019s still only one road in, from the Gold Coast to the ridge of Beechmont and then, a single-lane final climb through eucalyptus forest to the edge of the rainforest. Often the place is shrouded in mist. Most years, it rains a lot. I first visited Binna Burra as a high school biology student 40 years ago, staying in the dorm accommodation at the campsite across from the main lodge. I had all the attitude of a damaged teen and a firm belief that nothing could surprise or move me. And yet, here it was, this place of giant trees and different air and light that changes minute to minute. The birds, the understory, the smell of it. I can\u2019t hope to make you understand. You\u2019d have to go there. I do not come from a hiking family \u2013 we never once visited a national park \u2013 but that first experience began for me a lifelong love affair with this national park in particular and national parks more generally. And what a gift it has been. Like a mother, the rainforest at Binna Burra takes you in its arms. In one way or another, I have been in those arms ever since. Binna Burra Lodge\u2019s bird-in-boots logo was possibly daggy when it was launched in the 70s, and it\u2019s even more daggy 50 years on. I say this with all due affection, an affection I know is shared by other visitors. They will have slept in bunk rooms with shared amenities or splurged on a cabin of their own with a bathroom. They might have spent rainy days in the upstairs \u201clibrary\u201d with its yellowed books donated by guests. They\u2019ll have enjoyed a pre-dinner drink (or cup of tea) while watching the sunset under massive gums on the terrace. They\u2019ll have eaten the fancy boarding school food in the dining room, supplies trucked up three times a week \u2013 hash browns at breakfast, three meats and a veggie option at dinner, soup in a massive tureen on each table with fresh baked bread. More recently, they might have stayed in the self-contained skylodges, less bluestone, less timber but still with that simplicity that admits the grandeur. And they\u2019ll have walked. They\u2019ll have taken a packed lunch of meats and salads and bread and fruit cake on the trail. They might have gone just a little way in, to Tullawallal, rewarded by the sight of those ancient Antarctic beech trees Binna Burra is named for. Even in an hour in the rainforest, they\u2019ve heard more birds and seen more trees than in a week in a city. They return to the lodge and the staff listen as they describe a lyrebird\u2019s call as if they are the first person who\u2019s ever heard it. Others may have walked more kilometres than they thought possible. Once, I went abseiling with a lodge group. We hiked out and crawled through narrow caves to drop down off the Shipstern and Turtle Rock, finishing in the evening at Natural Bridge to see the glow-worms. I\u2019m afraid of heights and small spaces. It didn\u2019t matter out there. In recent years, I have shied away from the lodge, preferring a campsite in the national park to a soft bed and conviviality. Perhaps I\u2019ve wanted time alone, grieving for the world, but now, I wish I\u2019d stayed at the lodge more often. You\u2019d look around the dining room at night and you\u2019d see it on the faces. It\u2019s wonder, the experience of awe. It\u2019s what nature gives us, a chance to be small, insignificant. At Binna Burra, you are gently encouraged to come to understand just how little you matter. And it\u2019s a relief. The fire was swift and out of control by Friday when the lodge was evacuated. On Saturday, no one could get in to fight it. It was a black dawn for Binna Burra\u2019s director and 70 staff on Sunday. The dining room is gone. The lodge cabins are all gone. Even the new sky lodges are devastated. Perhaps it was always written that this would happen. It has happened. A place that offered nothing but a way to help us see has been destroyed by our blindness. Now is the time, if you have breath in your body and have ever experienced Lamington national park and Binna Burra Lodge, to help them out in whatever way you can. I am hoping they will set up a support page. I will be on it as soon as they do. Because the rainforest is still there to be shared. There is something fundamentally good and unchanged about Binna Burra, as if the place itself takes over whoever happens to be in charge. Whatever rises from the ashes will be different; of course it will. But the new Binna Burra will still be the place where Antarctic beech trees grow. It can provide another generation and another with the safest arms they will ever rest in. It\u2019s us who have a chance to do something to help make it real.

But the most common night-time purchase on the credit card \u2013 which can be used at any retail outlet \u2013 is for holidays and flights. Mike Jackson, director of financial services at John Lewis &amp; Partners, said: \u201cShopping is now a 24-hour activity. More customers are shopping on their smartphones and tablet computers and it would appear many are using this technology to shop from the comfort of their own beds.\u201d Women are much more likely to spend the early hours shopping than men, according to the data. It found that women account for 66% of purchases made between midnight and 6am, although their average spend was below that of men. Two decades ago, Saturday afternoon was the peak spending time on cards in the UK, but online shopping has revolutionised spending habits. Research by Barclaycard in 2016 found that late evening browsing was changing the shape of shopping, with 10.18pm the most common time to make a purchase. It said that nocturnal shopping increases when the clocks go back, with long dark evenings encouraging people to stay home and shop online instead.

New Look, Carpetright, Mothercare and Debenhams have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s crisis-hit retailers suffered a dramatic fall in shopper numbers in the last three months as consumers continued to opt to visit out of town retail parks, or to shop online. According to the latest footfall data, the scorching hot bank holiday weekend failed to halt the decline in people entering high street stores, leading to a 1.9% drop last month compared with a year ago. Over the last three months, high street retailers recorded a fall in shopper numbers of 3.1%, according to retail data company Springboard, which revealed the number of people visiting retail parks rose by 1% last month. The figures will not make happy reading for store managers following a torrid year that has forced the sector to discuss whether it faces an existential crisis. Multiple chains such as Poundworld, Maplin, Toys R Us and Multiyork have all entered administration. New Look, Carpetright, Mothercare and Debenhams have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills. Arcadia, the owner of Topshop and other fashion brands, faces an uncertain future. Marks &amp; Spencer is also in the process of closing 100 shops by 2022 \u2013 further adding to the sense of despair on the high street. Springboard said shopping centres are particularly struggling to attract people through their doors, as the stores try to compete with the inexorable rise in online buying. Shopping centre footfall declined by 2.2% in August compared with a year ago, it said. Helen Dickinson, who leads the British Retail Consortium, said the figures reflect how cautious consumers are holding back on discretionary spending and not heading out to the shops. \u201cOnly retail parks, with their combination of activities and shopping, were able to buck the trend, and there is little sign that the stresses on retail will abate any time soon,\u201d she said. \u201cStuck between weak demand thanks to Brexit uncertainty, and rising costs resulting from business rates and other public policy costs, many retailers are clearly struggling.

These latest figures will also do little to ease the concerns of Britain\u2019s convenience store owners, who have warned that the disruption of a no-deal Brexit could push many owners who are already working 70 hours a week over the edge. Association of Convenience Stores chief executive James Lowman said his members, who employ more than 400,000 shop staff, would be significantly affected following a no-deal Brexit. He said: \u201cConvenience stores have a unique reach into every community, so it\u2019s absolutely essential that the regular delivery and supply of products to our sector is maintained in the event of disruption as a result of no deal, especially for isolated communities where their local shop is the only place for people to get everyday groceries for miles around.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>From a sunny sitting room, 26-year-old <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp4_eaWIdkiW37Fg4Moi9Ag\">Kristel</a> beams at the camera she has set up to broadcast her life to her 49,000 YouTube subscribers. \u201cI struggled with acne and I had body issues,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNcTqykDJ98&amp;t=204s\">she explains</a>. \u201cI think I [now] look better and I think more positively \u2026 I\u2019ve been told how much more attractive I\u2019ve got.\u201d Later, she will intercut the video with photographs of herself taken over the previous eight months, her skin growing noticeably more radiant, her hair changing from lackluster to glossy.</p> <p>But with her before-and-after shots, Kristel isn\u2019t documenting a weight-loss journey or a new skincare regime. Instead, she credits her new glow to a movement that has lurked in corners of the internet for several years.</p> <p>Kristel is a follower of <a href=\"http://www.nofap.com/\">NoFap</a>, a platform that encourages its users to refrain from masturbation. She claims her new lifestyle has led to a complete physical and mental reformation.</p> <p>\u201cAfter starting NoFap I felt more motivation, more willpower and more discipline,\u201d Kristel tells me. \u201cI decided to take part in the movement because I like challenging myself and I wanted to prove that I could accomplish this.\u201d</p> <p>The flippantly named NoFap community has gained a strange prominence since it was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-nofap-2013-11\">founded in 2011</a> by Pittsburgh web developer Alexander Rhodes. Inspired by a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12659241\">small study </a>that suggested that male testosterone levels rose after seven days of abstinence from ejaculation, followers avoid masturbation in order to \u201creboot\u201d their brains.</p> <p>Having first gained momentum among men in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/\">Reddit forums</a> and backwaters of the internet, the community regards NoFap as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoFap\">sexual health program</a> to combat porn addiction. But there is also a consensus among many NoFappers (who often brand themselves \u201cFapstronauts\u201d) that refraining from masturbation can lead to \u201c<a href=\"https://mrmindblowing.com/25-crazy-benefits-of-nofap-the-superpowers-of-nofap/\">superpowers</a>\u201d, ranging from increased energy and confidence to commanding respect from peers or curing social anxiety. NoFap\u2019s Reddit forum now has more than <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/why-are-young-men-stopping-themselves-masturbating_uk_5d2f0f49e4b0a873f6449ff8\">450,000 members</a> primarily in North America and the UK, and Kristel is part of a smaller subset of female subscribers.</p> <p>Rhodes estimates that about 5% of the NoFap followers are female and although the cohort may be small, it is seemingly mighty. Kristel\u2019s transformation video alone has racked up almost 1.5m views to date. She says the vast majority of her viewers are based in the US, with a smaller but significant following in India.</p> <p>In an attempt to engage its rising female cohort, NoFap has recently introduced new measures including hiring female moderators and creating <a href=\"https://nofap.com/forum/index.php?forums/women-in-reboot.22/\">women in reboot</a> forums.</p> <p>Kristel explains: \u201cEven though most of the responses I get are encouraging and positive, there is also a side of people not taking it seriously. They think girls don\u2019t even masturbate to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>Kristel has become something of a poster-girl for the Femstronaut movement, but there is a darker side to NoFap.

      "bodyText": "From a sunny sitting room, 26-year-old Kristel beams at the camera she has set up to broadcast her life to her 49,000 YouTube subscribers. \u201cI struggled with acne and I had body issues,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think I [now] look better and I think more positively \u2026 I\u2019ve been told how much more attractive I\u2019ve got.\u201d Later, she will intercut the video with photographs of herself taken over the previous eight months, her skin growing noticeably more radiant, her hair changing from lackluster to glossy. But with her before-and-after shots, Kristel isn\u2019t documenting a weight-loss journey or a new skincare regime. Instead, she credits her new glow to a movement that has lurked in corners of the internet for several years. Kristel is a follower of NoFap, a platform that encourages its users to refrain from masturbation. She claims her new lifestyle has led to a complete physical and mental reformation. \u201cAfter starting NoFap I felt more motivation, more willpower and more discipline,\u201d Kristel tells me. \u201cI decided to take part in the movement because I like challenging myself and I wanted to prove that I could accomplish this.\u201d The flippantly named NoFap community has gained a strange prominence since it was founded in 2011 by Pittsburgh web developer Alexander Rhodes. Inspired by a small study that suggested that male testosterone levels rose after seven days of abstinence from ejaculation, followers avoid masturbation in order to \u201creboot\u201d their brains. Having first gained momentum among men in Reddit forums and backwaters of the internet, the community regards NoFap as a sexual health program to combat porn addiction. But there is also a consensus among many NoFappers (who often brand themselves \u201cFapstronauts\u201d) that refraining from masturbation can lead to \u201csuperpowers\u201d, ranging from increased energy and confidence to commanding respect from peers or curing social anxiety. NoFap\u2019s Reddit forum now has more than 450,000 members primarily in North America and the UK, and Kristel is part of a smaller subset of female subscribers. Rhodes estimates that about 5% of the NoFap followers are female and although the cohort may be small, it is seemingly mighty. Kristel\u2019s transformation video alone has racked up almost 1.5m views to date. She says the vast majority of her viewers are based in the US, with a smaller but significant following in India. In an attempt to engage its rising female cohort, NoFap has recently introduced new measures including hiring female moderators and creating women in reboot forums. Kristel explains: \u201cEven though most of the responses I get are encouraging and positive, there is also a side of people not taking it seriously. They think girls don\u2019t even masturbate to begin with.\u201d Kristel has become something of a poster-girl for the Femstronaut movement, but there is a darker side to NoFap. Among the reams of Reddit discussions and YouTube videos, a fundamentally misogynistic rhetoric regularly emerges. The movement\u2019s focus on testosterone inherently idealizes masculine traits, and the oft-cited claim that NoFap makes men more attractive to the opposite sex objectifies women and frames them as the \u201cprize\u201d in the game of who can hold out for longest. Some have even linked the movement to incel (involuntarily celibate) communities, who extend contempt towards masturbation and pornography to a more insidious hatred of women. So what drives women to participate in this male-dominated trend? Like Kristel, Chicago-based YouTuber Alana, 29, joined the NoFap movement as a lifestyle improvement in 2017. \u201cI think the biggest issue is porn,\u201d she says. \u201cPorn is where people go to learn how to have sex, and most of the time the approach to sex in porn is built around the man\u2019s pleasure. Even as a heterosexual woman, porn made me sexualize and objectify women \u2026 I also began to think of myself as a sex object, and that my value came from my sex appeal.\u201d Kristel also cites the influence of pornography as a key driver of the trend.

      "body": "<p>Dr Stefaan Vossen is the founder and clinical director of the Core clinic, an integrative health and wellness centre in Warwickshire.

A GP wrongly concluded that Vossen\u2019s symptoms were just part and parcel of normal life. It was only after spending seven months fruitlessly doing more exercise, improving his diet and getting more sleep that Vossen sought a second opinion. \u201cI had severely low testosterone,\u201d he says. \u201cI was producing about half the level I should have been.\u201d Within three to four months of taking testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), Vossen was back to his old self.</p> <p>\u201cClinical awareness of low testosterone is terrible,\u201d he says. Once diagnosed, however, treatment is quick and simple: in the UK, TRT comes in the form of a cream or an injection, but it is not cheap, costing up to \u00a328 a month.</p> <p>Testosterone \u2013 often called the male sex hormone (although women also produce it in lower levels) \u2013 plays an important role in men\u2019s physical and emotional wellbeing. It helps men maintain muscle and bone strength, sperm production and the desire to have sex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/10/low-testosterone-neednt-spell-misery\">Low testosterone needn\u2019t spell misery | Brief letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robbie Williams is probably the best-known case of low testosterone, after his wife, Ayda Field, revealed last year that when the singer had depression in his 30s, doctors found he had the testosterone levels of an 80-year-old man. TRT, apparently, made an instant difference to his energy levels, giving him a \u201cnew lease of life\u201d.</p> <p>But it is older men who are more commonly affected. With men, testosterone production peaks in their late 20s and, when they hit 30, it begins to decline by about 1% a year. As many as 10% of men aged 40 to 60 have low testosterone, increasing to one in five among those aged between 60 and 80. It increases again to 35% for those aged over 80.</p> <p>Diagnosing low testosterone should be easy. It can be identified with a simple blood test, but the condition cannot be inferred from other tests: men have to know to ask for it or GPs need to suggest it. When 71-year-old Jim Morgan\u2019s concentration started failing, his motivational drive began to wane and his interest in social situations drifted, he feared he was developing dementia \u2013 and so he did nothing. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t the same person, but what could I do, if it really was dementia?\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife, Zoe, was pretty worried.\u201d Then Morgan visited a doctor for an unrelated issue who thought to give him a blood test to check for low testosterone. To Morgan\u2019s amazement, the test came back with a score of 7nmol/l. A normal testosterone range begins at 10nmol/l.</p> <p>Morgan was prescribed TRT last summer, and says the effect was immediate. \u201cMy energy is back, my attention to detail, my drive,\u201d he adds. \u201cZoe and I run two property businesses in two countries, and I\u2019m back to working seven days a week on full throttle.\u201d</p> <p>Zoe is equally astonished by the ease of the test and the efficacy of the treatment. \u201cBut the extraordinary thing is that no one seems to know about low testosterone,\u201d she says. \u201cI now tell every man over 50 I meet that they should have their testosterone tested.\u201d</p> <p>Even when low testosterone does get picked up, there is the added problem that there is no national agreement about the level at which GPs or endocrinologists should start treatment. Dr Jeff Foster, who works at an NHS practice in Warwickshire as well as running private GP services and specialist men\u2019s health clinics at Nuffield Health Warwickshire hospital, says the symptoms of low testosterone appear if the test shows less than 15nmol/l, but individual clinical commissioning groups, laboratories and endocrinologists often won\u2019t treat men unless their level is below 6nmol/l. Treating anything over that, it is often thought, is a lifestyle choice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1ca84cc888457fde06a4ff136193e3bdcf5194f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ca84cc888457fde06a4ff136193e3bdcf5194f/134_319_3199_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robbie Williams \u2026 had the testosterone levels of an 80-year-old.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robbie Williams \u2026 had the testosterone levels of an 80-year-old.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo we have got thousands of men walking round feeling rubbish who, even if they get their testosterone tested, are told they\u2019re in the normal zone and can\u2019t be treated,\u201d he says. This matters because, if it is left untreated, low testosterone can result in osteoporosis, high cholesterol, raised blood pressure and mental health issues.</p> <p>While age-related decline is the biggest cause of the condition, younger men can be affected, too: there is up to a 60% prevalence among obese men, a 47% prevalence among those with metabolic syndrome and a 45% prevalence among men with type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>Men who are naturally at the upper range of normal testosterone production and who eat a healthy diet, exercise, limit their intake of alcohol, opiates and other prescribed medicines may never notice any symptoms of age-related testosterone decline. Those already at the lower end of normal, however, or who have other medical problems that reduce their testosterone production, will slowly begin to notice an onset of symptoms. Over months or years, these men have symptoms including decreased energy and strength, poorer concentration and memory, low mood, reduced sex drive and poorer erection quality. It can be harder to make gains in exercise, and they get fatter despite eating well. Many experience facial- or body-hair loss, and have night sweats or flushing.</p> <p>The similarities with the symptoms of women\u2019s menopause have triggered some discussion about whether men can have an equivalent \u201candropause\u201d. This has been largely discredited because the female menopause happens when a woman\u2019s body suddenly produces far less oestrogen; more like a cliff-edge. A man, on the other hand, gradually produces less testosterone.</p> <p>Men with low testosterone can be misdiagnosed as having chronic fatigue, depression, chronic infections, low thyroid, anaemia, liver disease, heart failure, thyroid disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease, insomnia or stress. Those with night sweats are sometimes told they have lymphoma.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A drop in men\u2019s vitality is brushed under the carpet in our society as an inevitable part of ageing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Foster adds that TRT is not a miracle drug that can solve all men\u2019s physical ills. \u201cWhile low testosterone is certainly undertested and underdiagnosed in the UK, that does not mean TRT is the answer to all our male health problems,\u201d he says. And not everyone with low testosterone needs treatment. The cause of the imbalance may be something that, if stopped or reversed, would lead to the body producing its own testosterone again without medical help: stopping taking pain medication, for example, or losing weight. If, however, the low testosterone has a nonreversible cause, men can require lifelong replacement therapy.</p> <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in 2014 about a possible increased risk of heart attacks and strokes with the use of testosterone replacement, although other studies have not come to the same conclusion, and further research has been requested by the FDA. In the meantime, it recommends that testosterone is prescribed for men who do not produce testosterone or who have low levels as a result of a medical condition that requires treatment, such as chemotherapy. In the UK, there are no official NHS guidelines. .</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/09/race-to-replace-viagra-patents-erectile-dysfunction-drug-medical-research-cialis-eroxon\">The race to replace Viagra</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Foster\u2019s patients tend to come to his clinic after months, if not years, of health problems. \u201cIt takes so long because it\u2019s a slow-onset disease, and many people are told: \u2018You\u2019re just working too hard\u2019, \u2018It\u2019s normal \u2026 you\u2019re just getting older\u2019 or \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have sex much now you\u2019re in your 50s\u2019,\u201d he says.

Morgan was prescribed TRT last summer, and says the effect was immediate. \u201cMy energy is back, my attention to detail, my drive,\u201d he adds. \u201cZoe and I run two property businesses in two countries, and I\u2019m back to working seven days a week on full throttle.\u201d Zoe is equally astonished by the ease of the test and the efficacy of the treatment. \u201cBut the extraordinary thing is that no one seems to know about low testosterone,\u201d she says. \u201cI now tell every man over 50 I meet that they should have their testosterone tested.\u201d Even when low testosterone does get picked up, there is the added problem that there is no national agreement about the level at which GPs or endocrinologists should start treatment. Dr Jeff Foster, who works at an NHS practice in Warwickshire as well as running private GP services and specialist men\u2019s health clinics at Nuffield Health Warwickshire hospital, says the symptoms of low testosterone appear if the test shows less than 15nmol/l, but individual clinical commissioning groups, laboratories and endocrinologists often won\u2019t treat men unless their level is below 6nmol/l. Treating anything over that, it is often thought, is a lifestyle choice. \u201cSo we have got thousands of men walking round feeling rubbish who, even if they get their testosterone tested, are told they\u2019re in the normal zone and can\u2019t be treated,\u201d he says. This matters because, if it is left untreated, low testosterone can result in osteoporosis, high cholesterol, raised blood pressure and mental health issues. While age-related decline is the biggest cause of the condition, younger men can be affected, too: there is up to a 60% prevalence among obese men, a 47% prevalence among those with metabolic syndrome and a 45% prevalence among men with type 2 diabetes. Men who are naturally at the upper range of normal testosterone production and who eat a healthy diet, exercise, limit their intake of alcohol, opiates and other prescribed medicines may never notice any symptoms of age-related testosterone decline. Those already at the lower end of normal, however, or who have other medical problems that reduce their testosterone production, will slowly begin to notice an onset of symptoms. Over months or years, these men have symptoms including decreased energy and strength, poorer concentration and memory, low mood, reduced sex drive and poorer erection quality. It can be harder to make gains in exercise, and they get fatter despite eating well. Many experience facial- or body-hair loss, and have night sweats or flushing. The similarities with the symptoms of women\u2019s menopause have triggered some discussion about whether men can have an equivalent \u201candropause\u201d. This has been largely discredited because the female menopause happens when a woman\u2019s body suddenly produces far less oestrogen; more like a cliff-edge. A man, on the other hand, gradually produces less testosterone. Men with low testosterone can be misdiagnosed as having chronic fatigue, depression, chronic infections, low thyroid, anaemia, liver disease, heart failure, thyroid disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease, insomnia or stress. Those with night sweats are sometimes told they have lymphoma. Foster adds that TRT is not a miracle drug that can solve all men\u2019s physical ills. \u201cWhile low testosterone is certainly undertested and underdiagnosed in the UK, that does not mean TRT is the answer to all our male health problems,\u201d he says. And not everyone with low testosterone needs treatment. The cause of the imbalance may be something that, if stopped or reversed, would lead to the body producing its own testosterone again without medical help: stopping taking pain medication, for example, or losing weight. If, however, the low testosterone has a nonreversible cause, men can require lifelong replacement therapy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in 2014 about a possible increased risk of heart attacks and strokes with the use of testosterone replacement, although other studies have not come to the same conclusion, and further research has been requested by the FDA. In the meantime, it recommends that testosterone is prescribed for men who do not produce testosterone or who have low levels as a result of a medical condition that requires treatment, such as chemotherapy. In the UK, there are no official NHS guidelines. . Foster\u2019s patients tend to come to his clinic after months, if not years, of health problems. \u201cIt takes so long because it\u2019s a slow-onset disease, and many people are told: \u2018You\u2019re just working too hard\u2019, \u2018It\u2019s normal \u2026 you\u2019re just getting older\u2019 or \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have sex much now you\u2019re in your 50s\u2019,\u201d he says. This means that many take action only when they have specific symptoms, such as night sweats or severe erectile dysfunction, or they break a bone from osteoporosis. Foster warns against home testing kits. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no way for a nonprofessional to use a home testing kit safely or effectively,\u201d he says. He has devised an online questionnaire to help determine whether low testosterone could be affecting you. \u201cIt is not an exhaustive tool,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it can be helpful in diagnosis. If you\u2019re concerned, go to your GP.\u201d Vossen says all men who are concerned about their energy levels should get tested. \u201cA drop in men\u2019s vitality is brushed under the carpet in our society as an inevitable part of ageing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut from my experience, men don\u2019t have to accept the loss of their vitality. They can do something about it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to the Society for Endocrinology\u2019s recommendations.

      "body": "<h2>Is inequality on the rise?</h2> <p>Income inequality has risen sharply since the 1970s in most advanced economies around the world, and has been blamed for increasingly polarised politics.</p> <p>While growth powered ahead in the second half of the 20th century, and resumed more fitfully after the 2008-09 financial crisis, there have been major winners and losers from the wealth generated.</p> <p>Sir Angus Deaton, the Nobel prize-winning economist who is leading a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/may/14/britain-risks-heading-to-us-levels-of-inequality-warns-top-economist\">five-year review of inequality</a> with the leading Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: \u201cThere is this feeling that contemporary capitalism is not working for everybody.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that London is gobbling up everything and there are cities that are doing OK, but there are large parts of the country where that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d</p> <p>There are a host of causes, including fiscal policy, technology, globalisation, deregulation, education, emasculation of trade unions and austerity.</p> <h2>What about globally?</h2> <p>During the 19th and for much of the 20th century, inequality between countries rose dramatically as the world\u2019s most advanced economies pulled ahead from poorer nations.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a>, the balance has been redressed more recently, reflecting strong growth in many developing nations, particularly China and India.</p> <p>The UK ranks among the most unequal nations in Europe, but is more equal than the US, the most divided wealthy nation in the world. According to one ranking system (the Gini coefficient \u2013 see below) South Africa is the most unequal country in the world. Scandinavian countries tend to have the lowest levels of inequality. According to the World Bank, Ukraine is the least unequal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-29T07:15:04/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-29T07:15:04/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>Branko Milanovic, one of the world\u2019s leading experts in inequality, has found that the rise of globalisation has fuelled a boom in inequality in advanced nations. The biggest winners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\">have been the richest 1% of people</a> on the planet.</p> <h2>How do we measure it?</h2> <p>The headline measurement of inequality is the Gini coefficient, also known as the Gini index. Named after Corrado Gini, the Italian statistician who developed the method during the early 20th century, the index gives a score from 0 to 100 to measure the distribution of a nation\u2019s income or wealth. A score of 0 would represent total equality while 100 would represent total inequality, where one person has everything.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householdincomeinequalityfinancial/financialyearending2019provisional\">Gini score</a> has remained in the mid-30s since the early 1990s, after peaking at 35.1 at the turn of the millennium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2019-09-02T16:10:24/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Inequality\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2019-09-02T16:10:24/embed.html\">Inequality</a> </figure>  <p>In that respect, the government can argue that inequality is not rising, as it remains roughly around the same level. However, that isn\u2019t to say that inequality is not high. In the early 1960s, the Gini score stood at around 26 and stayed there until the late 1970s.</p> <h2>What about other measurements?</h2> <p>Some analysts argue that the Gini index can be misleading, obscuring the true extent of inequality. Robert Joyce, the deputy director at the IFS, said: \u201cThe Gini is masking different things going on, like the fact that the top 1% is still pulling away from everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>There are other methods, such as the Palma ratio, which gives the ratio of the income held by the richest 10% of individuals to that of the poorest 40% , and the 90:10 ratio, which looks at the incomes of those 90% up the earnings ladder compared with those only 10% of the way up. They broadly mirror the trend seen in the Gini; rising rapidly since the start of the 1980s, then remaining largely unchanged over the past 10 years.</p> <p>Looking beyond the headline measurements could tell a different story. Analysis by the IFS has shown the share of income going to the top 1% of richest households has nearly tripled in the past four decades, from 3% in the late 1970s to about 8% today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-28T14:27:40/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-28T14:27:40/embed.html\">Chart</a> </figure>  <p>Average chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 in 2017 was 145 times higher than that of the average worker, up from just 47 times in 1998. The lowest earning working households earn little more after inflation than they did in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of austerity and weaker economic growth since the financial crisis, academics suggest public perceptions of inequality have increased despite a relatively unchanged Gini score.</p> <p>Economists like analogies. One telling the impact of inequality goes like this: when the traffic comes to a standstill on a motorway, people often become irate when the lane next to their own pulls ahead, leaving them trapped. This appears to have increasingly become the feeling for many in society over the past decade as economic growth has raised the living standards of few, rather than many.</p> <p>\u201cThe trigger for people becoming more aware of inequality was the crisis and the slowdown in real growth,\u201d says Milanovic. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a topic on its own that came up just as people saw Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos being rich. It came as incomes hadn\u2019t risen as they\u2019d been expecting they might be. And then somebody else really at the top was taking all the gains.\u201d</p> <p>Average wages in Britain, adjusted for inflation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/12/uk-wages-have-not-yet-recovered-to-pre-crisis-levels-says-ifs\">remain below the level seen before the financial crisis</a>. But big pay rises are starting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/14/hammond-could-have-ended-austerity-earlier-without-brexit-ifs\">return for people paid more than \u00a31m a year</a>.</p> <h2>Are there other types of inequality?</h2> <p>For the most part when we think about inequality we think about income or wealth. But there are divisions beyond material standards of living, such as in health, education and social mobility, as well as between gender, race, age, geography and social groups.</p> <p>Deaton says changes to education policy, including the expansion of university access, may have had an impact on inequality.</p> <p>\u201cYou get an elite who think they did it all on their own and they deserve their position, and the people who didn\u2019t pass exams and feel left behind. First they think the system is rigged which is a reasonable thing to think and then also partway blame themselves,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve created this meritocratic aristocracy and people who didn\u2019t make it are pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/wealthingreatbritainwave5/2014to2016#total-wealth\">Office for National Statistics</a>, the top 10% of households by income earn 6.8 times more than those on the lowest rung, but the wealthiest 10% have 290 times more in total assets than those at the bottom of the pile.</p> <p>The level of wealth in Britain \u2013 including property, cash savings, shares and pensions \u2013 has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/04/has-the-time-come-for-a-wealth-tax-in-the-uk\">risen by 15% in the two years to June 2016 to a record \u00a312.8tn</a>. The vast stockpile is unevenly spread: the top 10% of households own almost half, while the poorest fifth\u2019s overall wealth has declined in real terms.</p> <p>Almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/gender-pay-gap-figures-show-eight-in-10-uk-firms-pay-men-more-than-women\">eight out of 10 British companies</a> pay men more than women, while women are paid a <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2018\">fifth less than men</a> on average. Workers of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/jul/09/ethnic-pay-gap-bangladeshi-workers-earn-fifth-less-white-britons\">lowest average pay of any ethnic group</a>, in the latter case earning 20.1% less than white British workers.</p> <p>It goes without saying that inequality between regions \u2013 and generations \u2013 has been rising in the UK as well. The proportion of top 1% highest income taxpayers who live in London has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/06/london-is-increasingly-home-to-the-top-1-by-income-study-finds\">grown by a fifth since the early 2000s</a>.</p> <h2>What are the consequences of inequality?</h2> <p>While some degree of inequality might be inevitable in a market-based system, extreme divisions can have far-reaching consequences. Among the most visible in recent years is the polarisation of politics and the rise of populism in the UK and elsewhere around the developed world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> in the UK and the election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> in the US, as well as growing support for new political movements in Europe from both ends of the political spectrum, have been linked to rising inequality.</p> <p>Ted Howard, co-founder of the Democracy Collaborative, a leftwing research institute, says three people \u2013 Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett \u2013 own more wealth than bottom 160 million people in the US.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just as an economic fairness issue but also a democratic issue. Can you hold together a democratic culture and state when the wealth holding patterns show no democracy at all? It\u2019s a great threat,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38c6f3f69b2da23b581d2b742e895313cc9704a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38c6f3f69b2da23b581d2b742e895313cc9704a1/0_0_4724_3568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"old school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"755\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old-school inequality</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy Sime/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond political divisions the rise of inequality could result in negative economic outcomes.</p> <p>Rightwing economists have argued that redistributing income is self-defeating, but the IMF believes societal divisions can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/26/imf-inequality-economic-growth\">destabilise growth and create the conditions for a sudden slowdown</a>. Economies can be stifled when millions of people are held back from contributing to their full potential.</p> <h2>How do you reverse inequality?</h2> <p>Complete equality might be impossible to achieve. Some economists say an entirely equal society might be undesirable, arguing that a wholly homogenous world would lack diversity and dynamism. However, the most important question to therefore ask is whether inequality has risen too far, how to reverse it and how to prevent extremes from arising.</p> <p>The prevailing logic of the past four decades has been that stronger economic growth serves as the greatest antidote to inequality. Increasing the size of the pie means everyone has a bigger slice. Peter Mandelson, the Labour peer, is famously quoted as saying in the 1990s that he was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/26/mandelson-people-getting-filthy-rich\">intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes</a>\u201d for this reason.</p> <p>Attitudes towards tackling inequality may depend on your view of work and how it is valued. Does hard work deserve higher pay? Is banking more valuable than nursing? Are financial incentives the best way to draw the best out of people?</p> <p>The main weapons for tackling inequality have been the tax and spending tools available to governments. Progressive taxation and welfare transfers are key, but are by no means the only way to combat the division of income and wealth in society.</p> <p>In a sign of how fiscal policy can help, the top 20% of earners in the UK earn 12 times as much as the poorest 20% before redistribution through tax and benefits. After adding welfare transfers and deducting taxes, the gap falls to about five times. Boris Johnson has however <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnsons-tax-cut-would-benefit-richest-10-most-say-experts\">promised large tax cuts</a> that are likely to alter how this calculation looks in future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\"

      "bodyText": "Is inequality on the rise? Income inequality has risen sharply since the 1970s in most advanced economies around the world, and has been blamed for increasingly polarised politics. While growth powered ahead in the second half of the 20th century, and resumed more fitfully after the 2008-09 financial crisis, there have been major winners and losers from the wealth generated. Sir Angus Deaton, the Nobel prize-winning economist who is leading a five-year review of inequality with the leading Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: \u201cThere is this feeling that contemporary capitalism is not working for everybody. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that London is gobbling up everything and there are cities that are doing OK, but there are large parts of the country where that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d There are a host of causes, including fiscal policy, technology, globalisation, deregulation, education, emasculation of trade unions and austerity. What about globally? During the 19th and for much of the 20th century, inequality between countries rose dramatically as the world\u2019s most advanced economies pulled ahead from poorer nations. According to the International Monetary Fund, the balance has been redressed more recently, reflecting strong growth in many developing nations, particularly China and India. The UK ranks among the most unequal nations in Europe, but is more equal than the US, the most divided wealthy nation in the world. According to one ranking system (the Gini coefficient \u2013 see below) South Africa is the most unequal country in the world. Scandinavian countries tend to have the lowest levels of inequality. According to the World Bank, Ukraine is the least unequal. Branko Milanovic, one of the world\u2019s leading experts in inequality, has found that the rise of globalisation has fuelled a boom in inequality in advanced nations. The biggest winners have been the richest 1% of people on the planet. How do we measure it? The headline measurement of inequality is the Gini coefficient, also known as the Gini index. Named after Corrado Gini, the Italian statistician who developed the method during the early 20th century, the index gives a score from 0 to 100 to measure the distribution of a nation\u2019s income or wealth. A score of 0 would represent total equality while 100 would represent total inequality, where one person has everything. The UK\u2019s Gini score has remained in the mid-30s since the early 1990s, after peaking at 35.1 at the turn of the millennium. In that respect, the government can argue that inequality is not rising, as it remains roughly around the same level. However, that isn\u2019t to say that inequality is not high. In the early 1960s, the Gini score stood at around 26 and stayed there until the late 1970s. What about other measurements? Some analysts argue that the Gini index can be misleading, obscuring the true extent of inequality. Robert Joyce, the deputy director at the IFS, said: \u201cThe Gini is masking different things going on, like the fact that the top 1% is still pulling away from everyone else.\u201d There are other methods, such as the Palma ratio, which gives the ratio of the income held by the richest 10% of individuals to that of the poorest 40% , and the 90:10 ratio, which looks at the incomes of those 90% up the earnings ladder compared with those only 10% of the way up. They broadly mirror the trend seen in the Gini; rising rapidly since the start of the 1980s, then remaining largely unchanged over the past 10 years. Looking beyond the headline measurements could tell a different story. Analysis by the IFS has shown the share of income going to the top 1% of richest households has nearly tripled in the past four decades, from 3% in the late 1970s to about 8% today. Average chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 in 2017 was 145 times higher than that of the average worker, up from just 47 times in 1998. The lowest earning working households earn little more after inflation than they did in the mid-1990s. Against a backdrop of austerity and weaker economic growth since the financial crisis, academics suggest public perceptions of inequality have increased despite a relatively unchanged Gini score. Economists like analogies. One telling the impact of inequality goes like this: when the traffic comes to a standstill on a motorway, people often become irate when the lane next to their own pulls ahead, leaving them trapped. This appears to have increasingly become the feeling for many in society over the past decade as economic growth has raised the living standards of few, rather than many. \u201cThe trigger for people becoming more aware of inequality was the crisis and the slowdown in real growth,\u201d says Milanovic. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a topic on its own that came up just as people saw Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos being rich. It came as incomes hadn\u2019t risen as they\u2019d been expecting they might be. And then somebody else really at the top was taking all the gains.\u201d Average wages in Britain, adjusted for inflation, remain below the level seen before the financial crisis. But big pay rises are starting to return for people paid more than \u00a31m a year. Are there other types of inequality? For the most part when we think about inequality we think about income or wealth. But there are divisions beyond material standards of living, such as in health, education and social mobility, as well as between gender, race, age, geography and social groups. Deaton says changes to education policy, including the expansion of university access, may have had an impact on inequality. \u201cYou get an elite who think they did it all on their own and they deserve their position, and the people who didn\u2019t pass exams and feel left behind. First they think the system is rigged which is a reasonable thing to think and then also partway blame themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve created this meritocratic aristocracy and people who didn\u2019t make it are pissed off.\u201d According to the Office for National Statistics, the top 10% of households by income earn 6.8 times more than those on the lowest rung, but the wealthiest 10% have 290 times more in total assets than those at the bottom of the pile. The level of wealth in Britain \u2013 including property, cash savings, shares and pensions \u2013 has risen by 15% in the two years to June 2016 to a record \u00a312.8tn. The vast stockpile is unevenly spread: the top 10% of households own almost half, while the poorest fifth\u2019s overall wealth has declined in real terms. Almost eight out of 10 British companies pay men more than women, while women are paid a fifth less than men on average. Workers of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage have the lowest average pay of any ethnic group, in the latter case earning 20.1% less than white British workers. It goes without saying that inequality between regions \u2013 and generations \u2013 has been rising in the UK as well. The proportion of top 1% highest income taxpayers who live in London has grown by a fifth since the early 2000s. What are the consequences of inequality? While some degree of inequality might be inevitable in a market-based system, extreme divisions can have far-reaching consequences. Among the most visible in recent years is the polarisation of politics and the rise of populism in the UK and elsewhere around the developed world. Brexit in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US, as well as growing support for new political movements in Europe from both ends of the political spectrum, have been linked to rising inequality. Ted Howard, co-founder of the Democracy Collaborative, a leftwing research institute, says three people \u2013 Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett \u2013 own more wealth than bottom 160 million people in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s not just as an economic fairness issue but also a democratic issue. Can you hold together a democratic culture and state when the wealth holding patterns show no democracy at all? It\u2019s a great threat,\u201d he says. Beyond political divisions the rise of inequality could result in negative economic outcomes. Rightwing economists have argued that redistributing income is self-defeating, but the IMF believes societal divisions can destabilise growth and create the conditions for a sudden slowdown. Economies can be stifled when millions of people are held back from contributing to their full potential. How do you reverse inequality? Complete equality might be impossible to achieve. Some economists say an entirely equal society might be undesirable, arguing that a wholly homogenous world would lack diversity and dynamism. However, the most important question to therefore ask is whether inequality has risen too far, how to reverse it and how to prevent extremes from arising. The prevailing logic of the past four decades has been that stronger economic growth serves as the greatest antidote to inequality. Increasing the size of the pie means everyone has a bigger slice. Peter Mandelson, the Labour peer, is famously quoted as saying in the 1990s that he was \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes\u201d for this reason. Attitudes towards tackling inequality may depend on your view of work and how it is valued. Does hard work deserve higher pay? Is banking more valuable than nursing? Are financial incentives the best way to draw the best out of people? The main weapons for tackling inequality have been the tax and spending tools available to governments. Progressive taxation and welfare transfers are key, but are by no means the only way to combat the division of income and wealth in society. In a sign of how fiscal policy can help, the top 20% of earners in the UK earn 12 times as much as the poorest 20% before redistribution through tax and benefits. After adding welfare transfers and deducting taxes, the gap falls to about five times. Boris Johnson has however promised large tax cuts that are likely to alter how this calculation looks in future. Some economists and politicians have called for a universal basic income (UBI) to provide a safety net to prevent poverty, although such schemes could prove expensive, while others argue that more targeted spending on the most needy would be more effective. There are also calls to improve funding for education and services instead. The French economist Thomas Piketty, a world expert on inequality, has called for a global wealth tax, while the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has suggested using higher inheritance taxes to reverse the extreme concentration of wealth. Wealth and inheritance taxes are politically sensitive and are often gamed through loopholes, made harder in an increasingly globalised world where capital can flow across borders and into tax havens. The mention of wealth taxes often leads to warnings that an economy could lose investment from the rich, who say they would flee overseas. One alternative as Ed Miliband famously advocated is the idea of predistribution, which aims to make the economy hard-wired to produce less inequality. Greater spending on health and education can lower the persistence of income inequality across generations, as well as drive up productivity rates, employment and earnings over the long run. Some economists have suggested greater democratic ownership could prevent inequality from rising, alongside efforts to place more workers on boards and to use positive discrimination campaigns. Labour has called for the creation of shared-ownership funds that would give workers control of up to 10% of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, giving them a greater say over corporate decision-making and income from company profits through dividends. The government has started forcing companies to report their gender pay gaps and mooted the idea of mandatory ethnic pay gap reporting, in the hope that greater awareness of the issues force companies to address them. Some countries go further, forcing companies to publish workers\u2019 pay levels.

More and more accounts are now dedicating themselves to specific chonky cats \u2013 and their weight-loss efforts.</p> <p>\u201cA heavy cat is pretty adorable,\u201d said Mike Wilson, one of the owners of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iambronsoncat/\">Bronson</a>, a cat who was 33 pounds when he was adopted and is now 23 pounds, one year later. \u201cA big cat on a diet is a guilt-free way to follow an obese cat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

When they met him, he had to lie down to eat. \u201cHe just looked like a giant swollen ball,\u201d Wilson said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was three years old and he weighed 33 pounds,\u201d Hanneman said. \u201cThe standard cat weighs like nine pounds, so he was about the size of three pretty large cats at three years old. He couldn\u2019t move around.\u201d</p> <p>Bronson used to cry for more food before Wilson and Hanneman switched him to a wet diet that was less caloric but more filling. Even worse was when he would cajole them awake for feedings. \u201cAt 3 in the morning, he\u2019d come over and lay on us and purr in our faces,\u201d Hanneman said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fat cats are cute, but not so cute that they shouldn\u2019t be on a diet</p> <footer> <cite>Lauren Paris</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They enjoy posting about his weight-loss journey because cat weight loss is difficult. If cats lose weight too quickly, they can develop fatty liver disease, and typically sleep 18 hours a day and are hard to exercise, said Shari O\u2019Neill, the chief shelter veterinarian at the San Francisco Animal Care and Control. Cats are also grazers, so it\u2019s hard to measure out how much food they need to get through a day.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun sharing tips on losing weight and things we\u2019re doing with Bronson, knowing that a lot of people have this issue with their cat, even if it\u2019s not that extreme,\u201d Wilson said.</p> <p>But as with anything on the internet, there are trolls. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d Paris said. \u201cWe see, \u2018You\u2019re abusing this cat\u2019. We also see, \u2018I miss when Bruno was fat\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the top rules in the Facebook group, This Cat is Chonky, include no chonk-shaming, no owner-shaming and don\u2019t do politics or medical advice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "They\u2019re chonky, they\u2019re fluffy, they\u2019re thicc and body pawsitive. They\u2019re round boys, floofs and absolute units. The new animal trend on the internet celebrates the rotund and plump, with social media users focusing on the adorableness of a cat\u2019s rounded cheeks, a hamster\u2019s many rolls, a dog\u2019s rounded shape and a raccoon\u2019s voluptuous volume. The Instagram account Chonky Animals has more than 409,000 followers while the Round Boys and Round Animals accounts top out at more than 455,000 and 487,000, respectively. The Facebook group, This Cat is Chonky, has more than 395,000 members and hundreds of new posts each day. The trend raises concerns about overfeeding and keeping a pet unhealthy for the sake of cuteness. While humans can decide if they are healthy at every size, animals cannot, nor do they have the ability to tell their owners if they need help. But it has also inspired a wholesome movement toward making sure these animals remain healthy, as well as cute. More and more accounts are now dedicating themselves to specific chonky cats \u2013 and their weight-loss efforts. \u201cA heavy cat is pretty adorable,\u201d said Mike Wilson, one of the owners of Bronson, a cat who was 33 pounds when he was adopted and is now 23 pounds, one year later. \u201cA big cat on a diet is a guilt-free way to follow an obese cat.\u201d In addition to Bronson, who has more than 214,000 followers, there\u2019s Bruno Bartlett, the gray polydactyl cat that likes to stand on his hind legs, and his brother, Carlo. On Facebook, Fat Laila\u2019s efforts at fat camp are lovingly documented, as well as her missteps \u2013 when she snuck into the closet to steal treats one night. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the internet is so obsessed with fat cats,\u201d said Lauren Paris, the owner of Bruno and Carlo. \u201cThey\u2019re so cute.\u201d Paris felt drawn to Bruno when stories about a \u201cthicc\u201d cat up for adoption went viral last year. She and her friend wrote a song, Give Me That Fat Cat, ensuring not just the adoption, but Bruno\u2019s Instagram stardom. However, upon meeting him, she knew his claim to fame \u2013 his chub \u2013 could not stay. \u201cHe was so adorable, but he could barely move,\u201d Paris said. \u201cThe shelter was doing the best they could do, but he lived in a room with other cats and he would just eat their food.\u201d Because Bruno was already so public, his weight-loss journey became public as well. Paris posts when Bruno loses a pound, along with tongue-in-cheek hashtags such as \u201creal cats have curves\u201d. She posts pictures of him gazing longingly at human food, or meowing in the background to cooking bacon. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I think fat cats are cute, but not so cute that they shouldn\u2019t be on a diet,\u201d Paris said. \u201cBruno, we look back at old videos of him and we think, \u2018oh he\u2019s so cute,\u2019 but he\u2019s really cute now and he\u2019s going to live a lot longer. That\u2019s way better.\u201d Wilson and Bronson\u2019s other owner, Megan Hanneman, felt the same way when it came to Bronson\u2019s health. When they met him, he had to lie down to eat. \u201cHe just looked like a giant swollen ball,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe was three years old and he weighed 33 pounds,\u201d Hanneman said. \u201cThe standard cat weighs like nine pounds, so he was about the size of three pretty large cats at three years old. He couldn\u2019t move around.\u201d Bronson used to cry for more food before Wilson and Hanneman switched him to a wet diet that was less caloric but more filling. Even worse was when he would cajole them awake for feedings. \u201cAt 3 in the morning, he\u2019d come over and lay on us and purr in our faces,\u201d Hanneman said. They enjoy posting about his weight-loss journey because cat weight loss is difficult. If cats lose weight too quickly, they can develop fatty liver disease, and typically sleep 18 hours a day and are hard to exercise, said Shari O\u2019Neill, the chief shelter veterinarian at the San Francisco Animal Care and Control. Cats are also grazers, so it\u2019s hard to measure out how much food they need to get through a day. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun sharing tips on losing weight and things we\u2019re doing with Bronson, knowing that a lot of people have this issue with their cat, even if it\u2019s not that extreme,\u201d Wilson said. But as with anything on the internet, there are trolls. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d Paris said. \u201cWe see, \u2018You\u2019re abusing this cat\u2019. We also see, \u2018I miss when Bruno was fat\u2019.\u201d Some of the top rules in the Facebook group, This Cat is Chonky, include no chonk-shaming, no owner-shaming and don\u2019t do politics or medical advice. \u201cPeople see a picture of a fat cat and they think we made it fat,\u201d Paris said. \u201cOr when we just started to show his weight-loss photos, people who don\u2019t know anything about cats will say, \u2018Oh, he only lost two pounds? Well he should have lost more by now.\u201d She continued: \u201cYou don\u2019t know why a cat is fat. You don\u2019t know what diets have been tried. You don\u2019t know if it has diabetes or not.\u201d In between cute pictures of Bronson and videos of his monthly weigh-ins, Wilson and Hanneman also post about adoptable cats around the country that are largely overweight, something Paris thinks is a much-needed effort. \u201cSomething that\u2019s good about this internet trend is that it does draw attention to these pets that would be passed by traditionally,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these famous chonky cats came from shelters. I think that shines a really good light. Kittens are more likely to be adopted, but if these internet-famous chonky cats are more likely to get adult cats adopted, then we did our jobs.\u201d",

Most of them were comparably futile and ill-advised, and driven through with a similarly unthinking zeal.

First, those belligerent Blair-era insiders convinced that the Labour party had to embrace free markets and corporate power; then Cameron\u2019s ridiculous barefooted guru<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/15/steve-hilton-im-rich-but-i-understand-the-frustrations-people-have\" title=\"\">;</a> and now the increasingly infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-brexit\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a>.</p> <p>What combination of factors allowed such people to acquire their influence, and all this damage to happen? On the political left, there were too few strong voices making the case for equality \u2013 which is roughly where Jeremy Corbyn came in. On the right, the story of the last four decades is reducible to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/07/brexit-strange-death-british-conservatism\" title=\"\">demise of genuine </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/07/brexit-strange-death-british-conservatism\" title=\"\">conservatism</a>, that tangle of beliefs resolutely sceptical of grand schemes, and romantically attached to a lost country of patrician kindness, family and community, and the rule of pragmatism.

Of course, this flattering description ignores the malignancies that lurked underneath: what some people call ruling-class interest, a belief in inequality and base prejudice as aspects of the natural order of things; the age-old Tory tendency to lash out at anyone who dares question the hierarchies that the party has always seen as underpinning national stability. I would no more vote for this kind of Toryism than I would for the current version. But it still strikes me as a creed that might eventually speak to a country that has been disrupted to death.</p> <p>In the distant future, a reinvented conservatism might rediscover its lost reverence for this country\u2019s conventions and institutions. It could emphasise the local over the national, and small over big business. Its proponents might suggest leaving teachers, doctors and nurses to do their jobs, as free from bureaucratic interference as entrepreneurs, and spurning huge infrastructure projects in favour of the protection or restoration of post offices, branch railway lines and sustainable town centres. At a push, I could even imagine a retrospective acknowledgement that if ever there was an example of the follies of an overmighty central state, it was what became of Brexit, and the spectacle of a few maniacs at the heart of government playing fast and loose with almost every aspect of our national life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/06/three-questions-general-election-brexit-remain\">The three questions that will decide the next general election | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But where are we now, and what has modern Toryism given us?

Tony Blair advised the public to be \u201cswift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change\u201d. In the wake of the 2008 crash, David Cameron whacked us with austerity, and then demanded we participate in something he called \u201cthe global race\u201d \u2013 rhetorically, at least, the kind of haughty, borderline meaningless stuff that Tory Brexiteers have taken into the realms of absurdity. And all the while a new political stereotype was taking root: that of the adviser who stalks the corridors of Whitehall, clutching Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War and bemoaning the inertia of the government machine. First, those belligerent Blair-era insiders convinced that the Labour party had to embrace free markets and corporate power; then Cameron\u2019s ridiculous barefooted guru; and now the increasingly infamous Dominic Cummings. What combination of factors allowed such people to acquire their influence, and all this damage to happen? On the political left, there were too few strong voices making the case for equality \u2013 which is roughly where Jeremy Corbyn came in. On the right, the story of the last four decades is reducible to the demise of genuine conservatism, that tangle of beliefs resolutely sceptical of grand schemes, and romantically attached to a lost country of patrician kindness, family and community, and the rule of pragmatism. Its passing was symbolised by last week\u2019s withdrawal of the Tory whip from old-style Conservatives such as Kenneth Clarke, Nicholas Soames and Rory Stewart \u2013 the last of whose run for the leadership was essentially this worldview\u2019s final stab at influence in the party. As the Conservative party chases unicorns and follows the orders of a leader who is apparently prepared to trample whatever gets in his way, now is a good time to dig out the famous quotation from the English philosopher Michael Oakeshott, who said that to be conservative was \u201cto prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded\u201d. Of course, this flattering description ignores the malignancies that lurked underneath: what some people call ruling-class interest, a belief in inequality and base prejudice as aspects of the natural order of things; the age-old Tory tendency to lash out at anyone who dares question the hierarchies that the party has always seen as underpinning national stability. I would no more vote for this kind of Toryism than I would for the current version. But it still strikes me as a creed that might eventually speak to a country that has been disrupted to death. In the distant future, a reinvented conservatism might rediscover its lost reverence for this country\u2019s conventions and institutions. It could emphasise the local over the national, and small over big business. Its proponents might suggest leaving teachers, doctors and nurses to do their jobs, as free from bureaucratic interference as entrepreneurs, and spurning huge infrastructure projects in favour of the protection or restoration of post offices, branch railway lines and sustainable town centres. At a push, I could even imagine a retrospective acknowledgement that if ever there was an example of the follies of an overmighty central state, it was what became of Brexit, and the spectacle of a few maniacs at the heart of government playing fast and loose with almost every aspect of our national life. But where are we now, and what has modern Toryism given us? The prospect of the HS2 line, carving an increasingly expensive scar through rural England; the sell-off of Royal Mail and the destruction of so much of what holds places together by the worst kind of capitalism; schools so strangled by Whitehall edicts that their teachers don\u2019t want to teach any more; a politics that cannot speak convincingly about \u201ccommunity\u201d because it will not stop turning people against each other. To cap it all, many Tories seem entirely relaxed about the breakup of the United Kingdom, the ultimate sacrifice in their headless pursuit of our divorce from Brussels. Clearly, they are locked into this deathly trajectory with no sign of any change of course. But maybe in 15 or 20 years\u2019 time, amid the wreckage, they will look afresh at their own party\u2019s name, and realise where it all went so wrong. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The chicks are considered \u201chors d\u2019oeuvres\u201d of the bird world and now Sydney scientists need public help trying to understand how brush turkeys survive against the odds in urban environments. Brush turkeys\u2019 six-month breeding season kicked off in July and a team of researchers from the University of Sydney and Taronga Zoo have put out a call for community sightings of nesting mounds, breeding activities and chick hatchings across New South Wales and Queensland. John Martin, an honorary associate at the University of Sydney, said the birds use an ancient nesting method of laying eggs in mounds and the heat of decomposing vegetation incubates them ahead of hatching. Similar to sea turtles, the chicks receive no parental care, Martin said. \u201cIf you think about the urban environment with cats, dogs, foxes, roads, birds of prey, snakes, not to mention kids, it seems unlikely that they would be an urban survivor,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Martin said so far there had been no reports of nest mounds south of Sydney Harbour but they have been spotted on the northern beaches and as far west as Narrabri more than 500km away. There have been some unexpected sightings of brush turkeys at Bondi Beach, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019ve met some Irish backpackers and become friends,\u201d Martin joked. In Queensland, brush turkeys, which are also known as bush and scrub turkeys, have been spotted at Cape York. Brush turkeys can fly, but not well. \u201cThey can flap and get up into a tree to escape, but they can\u2019t fly across Sydney Harbour,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fear response \u2026 they\u2019ll run like the clappers and flap their wings and end up five metres up a tree.\u201d The chicks are able to hover up trees but can\u2019t get very high, so become easy prey for cats and foxes which can climb. \u201cI like to think of them as hors d\u2019oeuvres running around waiting to be eaten. How are they surviving in the urban environment? It just blows my mind,\u201d Martin said. Groups of the birds communally roost each night up trees. A male brush turkey will build nesting mounds that are used by up to 10 females to lay eggs. Males and females are independent and don\u2019t pair up. \u201cThey have a very promiscuous breeding behaviour,\u201d Martin said. Chicks are expected to begin hatching in coming weeks all the way through until February. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the potential reasons for them being successful, you can argue that they\u2019re somewhat prolific breeders \u2013 if you\u2019ve got a very high mortality rate for juveniles then you\u2019ve got to compensate,\u201d he said. Brush turkeys have strong legs which they use to rake through leaf litter for insects, worms, skinks, berries and seeds. The Australian brush turkey came 26th in Guardian/Bird Life Australia bird of the year poll in 2017 with a vote of 1.24%. The poll will return in October. \u2022 People can report brush turkey nest mounds, breeding activities and chick hatchings at this link.",

      "bodyText": "Tunisia will hold its second-ever presidential elections on 15 September in a poll seen as a major test of the only democracy to emerge from the 2011 Arab spring. The death in July of the country\u2019s president, Beji Caid Essebsi, 92, a secularist who was instrumental in steering the country\u2019s transition to democracy, forced the polls to be held earlier than originally scheduled in November. Without Essebsi, Tunisia\u2019s broadly secular forces \u2013 held together by little other than opposition to the powerful Islamist Ennahda party \u2013 have scattered, creating an unpredictable contest that could reshape the political landscape of the fledgling Maghreb democracy. The country\u2019s 2011 revolution, the trigger for waves of popular uprisings in Syria, Libya, Bahrain and elsewhere, was driven as much by the price of bread as the cloying authoritarianism of the country\u2019s former leader, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. By many measures, the Tunisian economy is now in an even worse state, contributing to regular protests and a widespread sense of alienation from politics, according to public surveys. \u201cPeople say things are worse now than in 2011 because of problems with security and the cost they face, for example for schooling and day-to-day life,\u201d said Hichem el Amri, an engineer and youth worker in Sidi Bouzid, the town where the vegetable vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in December 2010 and ignited fierce pro-democracy protests across Tunisia and the Arab world. \u201cIf we compare the cost of vegetable, fruits, clothes, they are now twice or three times as expensive.\u201d The disillusionment has contributed to the radicalisation of young Tunisians, with an estimated 30,000 attempting to or successfully reaching battlefields in Syria and Iraq. Many are now seeking to return. Tunis, the capital, was rocked by two suicide bombings in June that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Yet Tunisia\u2019s transition to democracy has proved more resilient than some expected. The largely peaceful run-up to the polls has raised hopes the country will achieve its first handover of the presidency from one elected leader to another, considered a key hurdle in the development of young democracies. Another democratic milestone was broadcast on the country\u2019s television screens on Saturday: the first presidential debates between the Tunisia\u2019s major presidential candidates. \u201cOften in the Arab world, when we speak of competition we know who wins at the end, with 99.99%,\u201d Lassad Khedder, the head of a private TV channel syndicate, told Agence France-Presse on the eve of the debate. \u201cToday, we don\u2019t know who is going to win.\u201d One of the election\u2019s leading contenders was missing from the stage: Nabil Karoui, a populist television tycoon who has been compared to Italy\u2019s Silvio Berlusconi, was arrested on the eve of the campaign on charges of tax evasion and corruption. He has denied all the charges. He is still running as part of a crowded field of 26 candidates including Abdelfattah Mourou, a lawyer and the first Ennahda member to run for president since the revolution, and Abir Moussi, a supporter of Ben Ali trading on nostalgia for the former president\u2019s harsh rule, which is growing in some quarters. \u201cThe political class are happy there is democracy, elections and freedom of expression,\u201d Amri said. \u201cBut for other people, they don\u2019t care about these things if they have difficulties in their lives.\u201d Hailed as the Arab spring\u2019s only success story, Tunisia\u2019s revolution nearly descended into chaos in the years to 2013 after several leftist leaders were assassinated, allegedly by Islamic extremists, deepening the polarisation between the country\u2019s Islamist and secular factions. Yet it pulled back from the brink, helped by a coalition of civil society groups who brought warring parties together and were later awarded the 2015 Nobel peace prize. \u201cA large part of it is also due to the [political] leaders themselves,\u201d said Sarah Yerkes, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. After a close legislative election in 2014, Essebsi and his political rival, the Ennahda president Rached Ghannouchi, struck an improbable agreement to share power, widening the tent to include smaller parties in 2016. \u201cThese men were older, more experienced, and were both extremely committed to democracy, they saw the importance of it for Tunisia and decided it was best for the country to work together.\u201d Opinion is divided on the wisdom of the power-sharing truce, which has calmed the country\u2019s politics but stalled progress on difficult but urgent reforms that might split the unity government. Fearful of the bloody chaos that has enveloped some of the other Arab states that revolted in 2011, Tunisian leaders prioritised consensus, said Yerkes. \u201cTunisia gets all this attention because of what it did in 2011, and it would lose so much prominence if it was to lose that [democracy], including billions of dollars in aid from the US and EU,\u201d she said. \u201cBut stability also has a cost, and part of that is anger and frustration [at the lack of change].

It\u2019s the point at which your friend can lean in, push your hair out of your eyes and say lovingly and without judgment: \u201cListen: you need to dump him.\u201d Daniel Mallory Ortberg, it turns out, can get that intimate right away, drawing an auditorium of several hundred people in with him. We were all the drunk girl in the bathroom, leaning in and nodding as Ortberg dispensed advice to a series of absent letter writers. The letters, written in to Ortberg\u2019s long-running advice column Dear Prudence, were displayed on the screen behind him and co-host Clementine Ford. It was the first live taping of Slate magazine\u2019s Dear Prudence podcast in Australia. \u201cLove sometimes leaves a long-arse echo in one\u2019s life,\u201d he said to a person who wrote in saying they can\u2019t stop dreaming of their ex, three years after they broke up. \u201cHe has had 15 years to have a plan,\u201d he reassured a woman concerned about quitting a small business run \u2013 and apparently thoroughly misunderstood \u2013 by her cousin\u2019s husband. Together, Ortberg and Ford tackled such thorny questions as: how do my husband and I ensure we do not crowd our new joint boyfriend, who is on the rebound from a long-term relationship? How do I handle having a crush on an ex-student, who I have met again as an adult? How do I stop stalking my emotionally abusive ex on Instagram? Each question was handled with humour and compassion, tinged with the practical advice of your favourite aunt.

The orchard sits back from the main road, which in places is no more than a potholed track that cuts through jungles and villages. The plot of land is tranquil and filled with birdsong.</p> <p>For 42 years Sugio has cultivated his hectare, diligently planting a variety of colourful fruits and vegetables. He points out corn, durian, rambutan, pepper and sweet potato plots; ducks and chickens wander around in the afternoon sun. \u201cWe have everything we need here,\u201d he says. \u201cOur family can\u2019t even eat everything before it spoils, so we sell it at the market. Our life is already perfect.\u201d</p> <p>But he worries it might not be perfect much longer.

Explaining the rationale, Jokowi said that, \u201cA capital city is not just a symbol of national identity, but also a representation of the progress of the nation. This is for the realisation of economic equality and justice.\u201d</p> <p>The move comes amid dire predictions for the future of Jakarta \u2013 home to 30 million people \u2013 which is sinking due to unregulated groundwater extraction and prone to widespread flooding and congestion.</p> <p>The logic of the plan, first mooted nearly 70 years ago, is also to escape Java\u2019s earthquake risk and copy the good management of Seoul, the greenness of Singapore and Washington\u2019s separation of administration from business.</p> <p>If parliament approves the project, approximately 1.5 million people will move to the new capital in East Kalimantan at an estimated cost of 466 trillion rupiah ($32.7bn). A new government framework is expected to be set up on site by 2024 when the president finishes his second and final term in office. Jakarta will continue to be a commercial and financial centre, and the majority of its nearly 10 million residents are likely to stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/indonesia-zip/giv-3902eUWJdF9Wvaz1\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/indonesia-zip/giv-3902eUWJdF9Wvaz1\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But the proposed move is already causing concern amongst local residents in East Kalimantan including Sugio\u2019s niece, Wiwit. \u201cI saw the announcement about the new capital on TV and I was so shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will become of people like us? If they bulldoze our homes to build a new capital, where will we go?\u201d</p> <p>Sugio and his family were resettled in East Kalimantan as part of former president Suharto\u2019s transmigration program in the 1970s. In an effort to encourage residents to move from densely populated areas to less crowded parts of the country, families were relocated from Java to other locations across the archipelago including Kalimantan. Sugio made the move from Banyuwangi in East Java in 1977. The government gave each family of parcel of land measuring one hectare and Wiwit points out the absurdity of the government now taking back this land to make room for the new capital. \u201cThis is our home,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my birthplace. We have brought up our children and grandchildren here. We don\u2019t want to leave and we will fight if we have to.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if there were any possible positive aspects to the proposed relocation of the capital, Wiwit, who owns a small stall selling mixed rice dishes, said that she will open a larger restaurant to help feed the new government workers who will move to East Kalimantan from Jakarta.</p> <p>Other residents also have concerns about the move. Jubaen, 53, is the cultural chief of Pemaluan, a village inside the planned capital zone, and a member of the indigenous Paser Balik tribe. \u201cIn town people will kill their best friends, but here we have a strong sense of community. If we have to move, all of that will be lost,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bd84914dc31977fe0091be2a66abe76147a4e9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bd84914dc31977fe0091be2a66abe76147a4e9e/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jubaen, cultural chief of Pemaluan, a village in the development zone, fears the loss of community feeling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jubaen, cultural chief of Pemaluan, a village in the development zone, fears the loss of community feeling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aisyah Llewellyn/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jubaen says he witnessed the destruction of surrounding areas by logging and mining companies firsthand over the years, and fear that the new capital will make things even worse. \u201cWhen I was younger we could go into the nearby forest and collect honey and fruit, but then the area was taken over by ITCI,\u201d said Jubaen.</p> <p>ITCI, or the International Timber Corporation, is a logging company owned by Hashim Djojohadikusumo, the brother of former presidential hopeful Prabowo Subianto who was defeated by Jokowi in the election in April 2019. Much of the land in the new capital zone is owned by coal mines, palm oil plantations and logging companies. These companies are expected to profit by selling their land back to the government to make way for the new capital.</p> <p>Experts have warned that the new capital is an environmental crisis waiting to happen.

      "bodyText": "Sugio\u2019s orchard is his life\u2019s work and a great source of pride for the 79-year-old resident of Tengin Baru village in Indonesia\u2019s East Kalimantan. The orchard sits back from the main road, which in places is no more than a potholed track that cuts through jungles and villages. The plot of land is tranquil and filled with birdsong. For 42 years Sugio has cultivated his hectare, diligently planting a variety of colourful fruits and vegetables. He points out corn, durian, rambutan, pepper and sweet potato plots; ducks and chickens wander around in the afternoon sun. \u201cWe have everything we need here,\u201d he says. \u201cOur family can\u2019t even eat everything before it spoils, so we sell it at the market. Our life is already perfect.\u201d But he worries it might not be perfect much longer. The future of Sugio\u2019s farm is under threat because it sits on land that has been earmarked for the site of Indonesia\u2019s new capital, which is set to be moved from Jakarta to the sparsely-populated regencies of Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara on the island of Borneo. Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, formally announced the planned move on 16 August during his state of the union speech one day before Indonesia\u2019s 74th anniversary of independence. Explaining the rationale, Jokowi said that, \u201cA capital city is not just a symbol of national identity, but also a representation of the progress of the nation. This is for the realisation of economic equality and justice.\u201d The move comes amid dire predictions for the future of Jakarta \u2013 home to 30 million people \u2013 which is sinking due to unregulated groundwater extraction and prone to widespread flooding and congestion. The logic of the plan, first mooted nearly 70 years ago, is also to escape Java\u2019s earthquake risk and copy the good management of Seoul, the greenness of Singapore and Washington\u2019s separation of administration from business. If parliament approves the project, approximately 1.5 million people will move to the new capital in East Kalimantan at an estimated cost of 466 trillion rupiah ($32.7bn). A new government framework is expected to be set up on site by 2024 when the president finishes his second and final term in office. Jakarta will continue to be a commercial and financial centre, and the majority of its nearly 10 million residents are likely to stay. But the proposed move is already causing concern amongst local residents in East Kalimantan including Sugio\u2019s niece, Wiwit. \u201cI saw the announcement about the new capital on TV and I was so shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will become of people like us? If they bulldoze our homes to build a new capital, where will we go?\u201d Sugio and his family were resettled in East Kalimantan as part of former president Suharto\u2019s transmigration program in the 1970s. In an effort to encourage residents to move from densely populated areas to less crowded parts of the country, families were relocated from Java to other locations across the archipelago including Kalimantan. Sugio made the move from Banyuwangi in East Java in 1977. The government gave each family of parcel of land measuring one hectare and Wiwit points out the absurdity of the government now taking back this land to make room for the new capital. \u201cThis is our home,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my birthplace. We have brought up our children and grandchildren here. We don\u2019t want to leave and we will fight if we have to.\u201d Asked if there were any possible positive aspects to the proposed relocation of the capital, Wiwit, who owns a small stall selling mixed rice dishes, said that she will open a larger restaurant to help feed the new government workers who will move to East Kalimantan from Jakarta. Other residents also have concerns about the move. Jubaen, 53, is the cultural chief of Pemaluan, a village inside the planned capital zone, and a member of the indigenous Paser Balik tribe. \u201cIn town people will kill their best friends, but here we have a strong sense of community. If we have to move, all of that will be lost,\u201d he said. Jubaen says he witnessed the destruction of surrounding areas by logging and mining companies firsthand over the years, and fear that the new capital will make things even worse. \u201cWhen I was younger we could go into the nearby forest and collect honey and fruit, but then the area was taken over by ITCI,\u201d said Jubaen. ITCI, or the International Timber Corporation, is a logging company owned by Hashim Djojohadikusumo, the brother of former presidential hopeful Prabowo Subianto who was defeated by Jokowi in the election in April 2019. Much of the land in the new capital zone is owned by coal mines, palm oil plantations and logging companies. These companies are expected to profit by selling their land back to the government to make way for the new capital. Experts have warned that the new capital is an environmental crisis waiting to happen. Bernaulus Saragih, a lecturer in the forestry department at Mulawarman University in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, tells the Guardian the effect on the environment will be massive. \u201cThere will be changes in the water systems and environmental drainage, as well as forest encroachment.\u201d He said forests in the region are home to endangered orangutans that and Balikpapan Bay, which will become the local port, is a habitat for endangered dugong. The government has pledged there will be no building in protected forest and says it plans to reforest abandoned mines and illegal palm oil plantations. This week planning minister Brodjonegoro floated the idea of an orangutan conservation centre similar to one for giant pandas in the Chinese city of Chengdu. The Guardian contacted the Indonesian government for comment, but did not get a response. Conservationists remain unconvinced that there would be no spillover effects from moving the capital. Like many other residents, Yustinus Sapto, a local environmental researcher and activist based in Samarinda, is critical of the proposed move, pointing out that the region needs to fix its environmental problems caused by mining and logging companies first. \u201cMost of East Kalimantan\u2019s orangutans are in rehabilitation centres now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are meant to live in the forest canopy, but due to logging and other environmental damage, the trees are now further apart and they can\u2019t swing from one to another.\u201d As a result, the orangutans have to descend to the forest floor leaving them vulnerable to predators and where they grow weak from lack of exercise, he says.

Just rip up all the buildings and let it return to nature \u2013 the opposite of building a new capital.\u201d \u201cIn East Kalimantan we\u2019re not scared of things like terrorism, \u201c he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re scared of cement.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

He needs to keep that up because counter-punching won\u2019t do it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf355c2ab96ce36ac5c0677cfc8b8c80a234128a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf355c2ab96ce36ac5c0677cfc8b8c80a234128a/0_154_5336_3202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal celebrates winning a game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal celebrates winning a game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T21:20:56.557Z\">at 10.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7569e98f08143ee1ae28c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T20:52:00.542Z\">9.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: *Medvedev 3-4 Nadal (*denotes next server)</strong></p> <p>Medvedev falls behind love-15 on a double fault which Nadal must challenge to confirm, but the Russian rattles off four quick points for the hold. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7568ef8f082514879f054b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T20:47:54.207Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Medvedev 3-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server)</strong></p> <p>Medvedev falls behind love-15 on a double fault which Nadal must challenge to confirm, but the Russian rattles off four quick points for the hold. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d75682c8f08143ee1ae28be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T20:44:35.656Z\">9.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: *Medvedev 2-3 Nadal (*denotes next server)</strong></p> <p>Nadal consolidates in convincing fashion with the love hold.

He\u2019s embraced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/03/daniil-medvedev-stan-wawrinka-us-open-quarter-final\">his role as the villain of this tournament</a> and rode the momentum all the way to the championship match.</p> <p>Not that Nadal isn\u2019t doing just fine himself. The 33-year-old Spaniard has won 26 of his last 27 matches, including a 6-3, 6-0 drubbing of Medvedev in last month\u2019s Montreal final. A win today would lift him to a 19th career major title, pulling within one of Roger Federer atop the all-time leaderboard.</p> <p>We should be under way in a little more than a half hour. Plenty more to come between now and then. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d750bd08f082514879f02b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T14:13:01.483Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on today\u2019s final:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not for the first time, John McEnroe stirred the game into debate when he asserted that Roger Federer may finish his career with fewer grand slam titles than Novak Djokovic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal\">Rafael Nadal</a>. \u201cWho would have thought that possible?\u201d the walking quote asked on air shortly before Nadal stilled the robust challenge of the 23-year-old Italian Matteo Berrettini on Friday night to reach the final of the US Open for the fifth time, against Daniil Medvedev on Sunday.</p> <p>The Spaniard has won three of his 18 majors on this court, Federer has won five of his 20 here \u2013 in a row, the last of them 11 years ago \u2013 and Djokovic, the world No 1, has lifted three of 16 at Flushing Meadows. Federer and Djokovic have left town: the Swiss spent and hurting with a bad back, the Serb forced to quit with a shoulder injury.</p> <p>Nadal, normally the member of the Big Three most susceptible to breakdown, is still standing and looking awesome again.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from another cracking tournament at Flushing Meadows. Thanks as always following along with us and be sure to check out Kevin Mitchell\u2019s full match report. Nadal is second to speak and calls it \u201cone of the most emotional nights of my tennis career\u201d. He offers generous congratulations to Medvedev then turns directly to the crowd, giving them thanks for how they pushed him through. A big round of applause from the Ashe Stadium crowd as Medvedev is announced. He gives a warm congratulations to Nadal and jokes about the video they showed before the ceremony which showed each of the Spaniard\u2019s 19 grand slam wins: \u201cI was thinking to myself: \u2018If I won, what would they show?\u2019\u201d He then addressed the crowd directly, with whom he shared a somewhat antagonistic relationship during his run to the final. \u201cI want to talk to you guys,\u201d Medvedev says. \u201cI know earlier in the tournament I said something in bad way, now I want to say it in a good way. It\u2019s because of your energy guys I was here in the final. Tonight is going to be always in my mind because I played in the biggest court in the tennis world and in the third set when I was thinking which speech should I give, you guys were pushing me because you wanted to see more tennis and because of you guys I was fighting like hell.\u201d The trophy ceremony is just getting under way. Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s final statistics. Medvedev wins 51 points at the net compared to 50 for Nadal. Hardly a baseline-only battle. What a match. Spain\u2019s Rafael Nadal has won his fourth US Open title and 19th major championship with a 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 win over Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev after four hours and 50 minutes. Now for the history: Nadal has won his fifth grand slam title since turning 30, surpassing a record shared by Djokovic, Federer, Laver and Rosewall (four apiece) He\u2019s the second-oldest US Open champion in the Open era after Ken Rosewall (35) in 1970 He\u2019s won multiple grand slam titles for the fifth time in his career (2008, 2010, 2013 and 2017) Fifth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 4-6 Nadal Nadal serving with new balls for the title and he quickly falls behind love-15 on a netted backhand, but gets it to 15-all with an extraordinary sliced lob backhand into the corner. Now a scratchy forehand by Nadal puts him 15-30 down, but he gets it to 30-all with a big serve to the body that Medvedev can\u2019t wrestle back. And now Nadal frames a forehand six shots into a baseline rally and it\u2019s out, giving Medvedev a break point and a chance to level this fifth set. Nadal saves it with a thunderous forehand into the corner that Medvedev can\u2019t return for deuce. More chant sof \u201cRa-fa! Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\u201d cascade down from the upper deck. Now Nadal follows with a drop shot winner and he\u2019s got a third championship point. And this time he converts when Medvedev sends a return long! Fifth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 4-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev wins the first point with an overhead winner, but Nadal rattles off two quick points and he\u2019s two points from the championship. A backhand misfire by Nadal gets it to 30-all, but a deft touch volley by the Spaniard at the net gives him a championship point! Could this be it? Not yet! Medvedev crushes a backhand winner early in the point to save it for deuce. Nadal then hits forehand passing winner to set up a second championship point, but Medvedev saves that one too with a massive second serve. Now Medvedev crushes a 127mph ace down the middle \u2013 as some mouth-breather in the mezzanine screams \u201cGo Rafa!\u201d at the height of his toss \u2013 but he follows it with another unforced error for another deuce. Now Medvedev pounds another 127mph ace and this time he holds when Nadal can\u2019t return a running backhand into the court. The Spaniard will have a second chance to serve for the championship after the change of ends. Medvedev breaks in eighth game of fifth set! Fifth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 3-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal smacks his 57th winner early in the point for 15-love, then mixes in his fourth double fault of the match for 15-all. Now another extended rally erupts with Nadal winning the point after Medvedev missing a forehand while falling backwards for 30-15. Chants of \u201cRa-fa! Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\u201d echo throughout the building as chair umpire Ali Nili attemps to restore order. Nadal then sends a forehand past the baseline for 30-all and both these guys look completely gassed as they attempt to right themselves between points. Now Nadal goes wide ona backhand and it\u2019s a break-point chance for Medvedev. Oh wow. And now another time violation for Nadal which means he\u2019ll be starting on his second serve ... and then he double-faults! Medvedev has gotten one of the breaks back! Nadal breaks in seventh game of fifth set! Fifth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 2-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) It\u2019s clearly a must-hold for Medvedev, but he\u2019s pushed to 30-all from 30-love and it feels like this could be the match in these next couple of points. The Nadal hits a drop shot winner for 30-40 and he will have a break point for a chance to serve for the championship. And he converts it when Medvedev badly misses an overhead early in the point. Hasty, that. The world No 2 to serve for a fourth US Open title after the change of ends. Fifth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 2-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal could have used a stress-free service game after the eight-minute drama that preceded and that\u2019s what he got, racing ahead to 40-love and with three quick points off his first serve before slicing a backhand volley winner on the approach to consolidate at 15 and bring the crowd to their feet! Nadal breaks in fifth game of fifth set! Fifth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev opens with a 128mph ace down the middle \u2013 that\u2019s tied for his fastest of the match \u2013 then sits back as Nadal makes two more unforced errors off the forehand for 40-love. Nadal pulls two points back on a pair of baseline misfires by the Russian, then gets it to deuce with a backhand winner. Medvedev then mixes in a too-casual miss of the backhand and Nadal has a break point ... but the Russian brushes it aside with a 126mph ace wide. Nadal then stakes a second break chance and this time he converts with a tightly angled backhand winner on the approach at the end of a 28-stroke rally. What is actual life. Fifth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 2-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Back in a third set which seems like a lifetime ago, the more than 23,000 spectators here at Arthur Ashe Stadium were behind Medvedev because they wanted more tennis. Now they\u2019re squarely behind Nadal, trying to will him toward the finish line at full throat more than four hours into this wonderful battle. Nadal is able to hold at 15, putting the pressure back on the world No 5. Fifth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev holds easily, capping it with a backhand volley winner at the net. The Russian is 17-for-20 on serve and volley points today. He was 4-for-5 on serve and volley points in the first six matches of this tournament. Fifth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 1-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal falls behind love-30 and 15-40 on his serve and Medvedev has a pair of break points early in the fifth! The 19-time major champion is simply getting bossed around the court by the grand slam final debutant\u2019s forehand. Nadal saves them both with the forehand, but then badly misses a volley at the net to give the Russian a third break chance. Now a fatigued Nadal is called for a second time violation which results in the loss of his first serve (break point down!), but he saves it with a forehand and wins two more points from there \u2013 capped by a 121mph service winner down the middle \u2013 to hold. Phew! Fifth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 1-0 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev holds easily to open the fifth. Bear in mind: Nadal\u2019s record at major tournaments when leading by two sets is 205-1, while Medvedev\u2019s lifetime record in five-set matches is 0-4. The Russian is attempting to become the first player to win from two sets down in a US Open final since Pancho Gonzales won 16-18, 2-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 over Ted Schroeder in 1949. Medvedev breaks in 10th game of fourth set! Fourth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 Nadal Nadal races ahead and crunches a 118mph ace down the middle for 40-15, but follows with a mishit forehand for 40-30. Then Medvedev hits a highlight-reel passing forehand into the corner for deuce! Oh boy! Medvedev is two points from forcing a decider. Nadal then makes an unforced error on the next point and Medvedev responds with an outrageous backhand passing winner into the corner to force a fifth! Fourth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 5-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) And Medvedev answers Nadal\u2019s easy service game with a love hold of his own, capping it with a 127mph ace down the pipe. Nadal will serve to stay in the fourth set after the changeover. Fourth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 4-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal holds at love. Four quick and tidy points. 4-all in the fourth. Fourth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 4-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev holds at 30, punching in his eighth and ninth aces for good measure. It feels like a completely different match than an hour ago. Fourth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 3-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal holds for 3-all as night has fallen on Arthur Ashe Stadium and the clock hits three hours and 30 minutes. Medvedev it seems has figured out to play Nadal on the fly, coming in again and again to clearly trouble his Spanish opponent: 3-for-4 in this set and 36-of-45 on the day. Fourth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 3-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev hits a 123mph ace for 30-love and appears rolling toward an easy hold, but he follows with three straight unforced errors off the backhand for 30-40 and a break point. Now Medvedev goes with a serve and volley behind a second serve break point down (!) and Nadal misses the passing shot. Break point saved. Medvedev follows with an overhead winner for game point, but makes another backhand error for deuce. Now Medvedev makes his fifth unforced error off the backhand in just this game to gift Nadal a second break point, but it\u2019s saved when Nadal misfires on a backhand. Two quick points for the Russian and he\u2019s held going into the change of ends. Fourth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 2-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal opens with his 40th winner of the match (compared to 29 unforced errors), then rattles off three quick points capped by a 107mph ace twisting out wide for a hold at love. Fourth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) A whiff of a chance here for Nadal at 30-all on Medvedev\u2019s serve, but the Spaniard nets a pair of returns and they\u2019ll head to the changeover on serve early in the fourth. Fourth set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 1-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal makes his third double fault of the match for love-15, then nets backhand for love-30. Medvedev has won 15 of the last 20 points and Nadal is in a spot of trouble early in the fourth. The Spaniard wins two quick points, but then misfires off a forehand into the net off the back foot to go break point down. Medvedev then puts a backhand into the net and he\u2019ll rue that one! It was a bit of a sitter and the miss lets Nadal off the hook. The world No 2 then hits a backhand winner down the line punctuated by a lawnmower fist pump and follows it with a 125mph ace down the middle for the hold! Fourth set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 1-0 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev will serve in front in the fourth after breaking in the final game of the third. He races to 40-love, but Nadal answers with three straight winners for deuce. Then Medvedev rips a backhand past an approaching Nadal for game point, then hits another backhand winner to hold. It\u2019s been three full games since Medvedev has hit an unforced error. Mailbox time. This email from Abhijato Sensarma comes in during the set break. The dominance of the Big Three for these many years, even after reaching the ages they have, is an unparalleled success story in sports. I think we should give it up for Nadal even more. He\u2019s perennially the world\u2019s best on clay courts; yet, Djokovic has had the upper hand on clay courts for a long time now. Granted that the Serbian was forced to make an early exit from the tournament, but the hard court jinx has been broken for Nadal in the process. Will he now have a better chance of chasing Federer\u2019s Slam record down? Jinx, you say? We\u2019re not through yet here ... Medvedev breaks in 12th game of third set! Third set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 7-5 Nadal Medvedev takes the first point off Nadal\u2019s serve by winning an 18-shot rally, then another with a running forehand that Nadal can\u2019t catch up to. It\u2019s love-30 and the crowd is buzzing! And Medvedev crushes a forehand winner down the line for triple set point! Oh wow! Triple set point for the Russian! Nadal saves the first with a backhand volley winner, but Medvedev rips a backhand winner behind the Spaniard on the next point to claim the break and the third set. Well well well. Third set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 6-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev gets the best of Nadal in a 27-stroke rally to open the game, then follows with a 117mph ace, a backhand volley winner and a 120mph ace. He\u2019s still here. And now Nadal will serve to force a third-set tiebreaker. Third set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 5-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Another elementary service game for Nadal, who holds at love for 5-all. Back-to-back love holds for Nadal since he was broken. Medvedev\u2019s turn. Third set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 5-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev is pushed to 30-all on his serve, then Nadal takes command of a 28-shot exchange \u2013 the longest rally of the match \u2013 with a battery of inside-out forehands before winning it with a forehand for a break-point chance. Feels like a match point, really. And Medvedev saves it by coming forward for a forehand overhand winner that winds up in the President\u2019s Box. Nadal then hits a forehand passing winner for another break point, but Medvedev saves it again when Nadal puts a bouncing overhead into the net. Deuce. Medvedev getting run ragged here and looks completely gassed, but he delivers a leaping backhand volley for game point and earns the hold with an overhead winner. The pressure shifts to Nadal after the changeover. Woolie Madden checks in, via email: It\u2019s just mad, isn\u2019t it \u2013 you really do feel that the era of the Big Three will end, not with any of them being supplanted at the top by a new generation of talent, but with the Big Three themselves choosing to call it a day. It\u2019s not even like they\u2019re players in their thirties who are still mixing it with the best; they\u2019re on an entirely different level to the young pretenders. Third set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 4-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Another easy service game for the Spaniard, who holds at love. On the second point Nadal struck his 31st winner of the match (against 23 unforced errors) with a forehand volley at the end of a grueling 25-shot rally. Third set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 4-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev consolidates the break nicely, holding at 15. Some clever variety from the Russian in that hold, including a cheeky drop shot winner at the end of a 17-stroke exchange to set up game point. Medvedev breaks in sixth game of third set! Third set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 3-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Credit to Medvedev, who is battling out here despite what feels like an insurmountable deficit. He wins two quick points on Nadal\u2019s serve for love-30, then Nadal double-faults for 15-40 and a pair of break-point chance. Remember, Medvedev hasn\u2019t broken since Nadal\u2019s opening service game or even seen a break point since the Spaniard\u2019s first serve in the second. Nadal saves them both with back-to-back backhand volley winners for deuce, but gives Medvedev a third break point when he biffs an overhead winner after a 24-shot rally. This time Medvedev converts when Nadal misses a backhand from the baseline! We\u2019re back on serve in the third. Nadal breaks in fifth game of third set! Third set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Nadal pushes Medvedev to 30-all, then the Russian makes a forehand error from the baseline for 30-40. It\u2019s a break-point chance for the Spaniard and it feels like a crucial one ... and he converts it when Medvedev floats a backhand into the net! Simon McMahon checks in with a prediction, via email: Evening Bryan. Call me crazy if you want, but I\u2019m calling this for Rafa here and now. Straight sets. I think he\u2019s got a good chance in Paris next year too ... Nice one, Simon. Got any stock tips? Third set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 2-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) A flagging Medvedev is throwing everything he\u2019s got at Nadal in the Spaniard\u2019s service games, but it\u2019s all coming right back at him. Nadal caps an exhausting 23-shot rally with a forehand volley winner for 40-15, then holds his serve with an overhead winner. Third set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev holds at love, finishing it off with a 119mph ace out wide. Third set: *Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 1-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal cruises to another hold to keep step early in the third. That first-serve percentage continues to improve: it\u2019s up to 56% now after starting in the 35% range. Third set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6, 1-0 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev holds at 15 to open the third set, crunching a 121mph ace along the way. Second set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-6 Nadal Nadal opens with a forehand winner but Medvedev responds with two quick points for 15-30. Nadal then wins an easy point off his first serve followed by a wild miss by Medvedev for set point ... and he converts with a sharply angled forehand into the corner that Medvedev can\u2019t return into the court. Nadal wins the second after 48 minutes and is one set from a fourth US Open title and 19th overall major championship. Second set: Medvedev 5-7, 3-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) It\u2019s something of a must-hold for Medvedev, whose career record in five-set matches is 0-4. And he delivers with his first love hold of the afternoon for 3-5. Now can he break Nadal\u2019s serve? Second set: *Medvedev 5-7, 2-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal backs up the break convincingly, sealing the hold at 15 when Medvedev makes his 14th unforced error off the backhand. The Russian will serve to stay in the second set after the change of ends. Nadal breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: Medvedev 5-7, 2-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev falls behind love-15 then 15-30. Then a 26-stroke rally breaks out which finally ends when Nadal forces an error with a passing backhand. Two break points for the Spaniard but he needs only one, winning quick point off the forehand for the break of serve! Second set: *Medvedev 5-7, 2-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal holds at 15. Two more unforced errors from the Medvedev backhand, who\u2019s made 13 on that side. Second set: Medvedev 5-7, 2-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Big trouble for Medvedev as he makes his 22nd, 23rd and 24th unforced errors in quick succession to fall behind love-40. He saves the first with a winner off a quick net approach, then another with a forehand winner to cap a 17-stroke baseline rally, then the third with a backhand winner from the baseline. Another misfire from the baseline gives Nadal a fourth break point but Medvedev saves that too with an overhead that Nadal can\u2019t return in play. From there Medvedev is able to spring the escape with a couple of quick points. Second set: *Medvedev 5-7, 1-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal holds at 30. He\u2019s got that first-serve percentage up to 54% on the day after an anemic start. Second set: Medvedev 5-7, 1-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev comes to net only to get passed by a Nadal backhand, but he answers with four quick points for a drama-free hold. Second set: *Medvedev 5-7, 0-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) A promising chance for Medvedev to get right back into it as he wins the first two points of the second set on Nadal\u2019s serve. The Spaniard pulls back for 30-all but Medvedev pounds a forehand winner for 30-40 and a break-point opportunity. Nadal saves it when Medvedev misses a short backhand, already his 11th unforced error off that side today. From there Nadal is able to hold, capping it with a 123mph service winner down the middle. Nadal breaks in 12th game of first set! First set: Medvedev 5-7 Nadal Medvedev falls behind love-15 and 15-30, then 15-40 when Nadal caps an 18-stroke rally with a forehand winner. Two sets points on Medvedev\u2019s serve. The Russian saves the first when Nadal makes another unforced error off the backhand at the end of a 19-shot exchange, but Medvedev misses on a volley when Nadal tries a lob winner and he\u2019s broken him to take the first set after 62 minutes! First set: *Medvedev 5-6 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal races ahead 30-love and he\u2019s now won 14 straight points on his serve. Medvedev is able to push it to 40-30 but Nadal holds with a winner at the net and now the Russian will serve to stay in the first set. First set: Medvedev 5-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev is pushed every step of the way during an eight-minute, 14-point service game before Nadal finally blinks with a netted forehand from the baseline. Medvedev playing big with 14 winners to 18 unforced errors (compared to six winners and eight unforced errors for Nadal). We\u2019re at 5-all in the opener as the clock drifts toward the hour mark. First set: *Medvedev 4-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal breezes through another love hold, capping it with a 108mph ace out wide. He\u2019s won 12 straight points on his serve since getting broken. And he\u2019s doing it with a low first-serve percentage (46%). First set: Medvedev 4-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev makes his 10th, 11th and 12th unforced errors to fall behind love-15 then 15-40. Two break-point chances for Nadal. Medvedev saves the first with a forehand volley winner, then the second with a winner off a serve and volley. Medvedev gets to game point with another volley winner but Nadal pulls one back for another deuce. Now Medvedev makes his second double fault of the day to go break point down again, but Medvedev saves it with a backhand winner (upheld by a challenge) followed by two quick points for the hold. Medvedev playing more assertively over the last few minutes: he hit five winners in that last game after only three in the first seven games. He needs to keep that up because counter-punching won\u2019t do it. First set: *Medvedev 3-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Medvedev falls behind love-15 on a double fault which Nadal must challenge to confirm, but the Russian rattles off four quick points for the hold. First set: Medvedev 3-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev falls behind love-15 on a double fault which Nadal must challenge to confirm, but the Russian rattles off four quick points for the hold. First set: *Medvedev 2-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal consolidates in convincing fashion with the love hold. We\u2019re even steven in the opening. Neither man playing his best tennis so far, but you can\u2019t help but feel Medvedev may have let an opportunity slip in giving back that break so fast when Nadal was a bit out of sorts. Nadal breaks in fourth game of first set! First set: Medvedev 2-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Nadal is watching no time in trying to get back on level terms, taking the ball early on a couple of points to put Medvedev behind love-30. Medvedev gets it to 30-all, but Nadal rips a forehand winner to set up break point and then converts with a backhand from the baseline that Medvedev can\u2019t return. Medvedev breaks in third game of first set! First set: *Medvedev 2-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Medvedev hits a forehand winner to get into Nadal\u2019s service game at love-15. The Spaniard wins the next two points on gruelling rallies of 21 and 17 shots, but Medvedev hits winners on the next two points to set up another break-point chance. This time he converts when Nadal misses badly on forehand from the baseline early in the point. First blood to the young Russian as we head into the changeover. A key early statistic is Nadal\u2019s struggle on his serve: so far he\u2019s gotten just 5-of-14 first serves in (36%). First set: Medvedev 1-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Medvedev holds at 30 in his opening service game, anchored by a big first serve that he\u2019s getting in early. First set: *Medvedev 0-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Big buzz on Ashe as Nadal steps to the baseline to serve. Medvedev standing so far back awaiting the return, nearly in the first row. Nadal wins the first point when Medvedev makes an unforced error on a backhand from the baseline, then another with a goregeous forehand winner from around the netpost. But Medvedev pushes it to 30-all when Nadal double-faults then misfires on a baseline forehand. Next Medvedev gets the best of his opponent with a wicked backhand at the end of a 16-stroke rally and the Russian will have an early break-point opportunity. Nadal is given a warning for a time violation \u2013 next time it will be a fault \u2013 then smashes a service winner for deuce. Nadal then rattles off two quick points for the opening hold. The players have emerged from the tunnel! First comes Medvedev, who walks out to a smattering of boos but lots of cheers from the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd. Then it\u2019s Nadal, the crowd favorite who is greeted by roaring applause. Nadal wins the toss and elects to serve. Now they\u2019re going through the warm-ups. We should be under way in the next few minutes. Here\u2019s a look at how today\u2019s finalists match up. Nadal won the only previous meeting between the pair in the Montreal final on 11 August, strolling to a 6-0, 6-3 victory. Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for today\u2019s US Open men\u2019s final between Rafael Nadal and Daniil Medvedev. We\u2019ve got a delicious matchup in store between the second-ranked Nadal, who is bidding for his fourth title at Flushing Meadows, and the fifth-seeded Medvedev, who is making his major final debut as one of the hottest players on the men\u2019s tour. Medvedev, who is seeking to become the first men\u2019s grand slam champion born in the 1990s, enters today\u2019s match on a career-best 12-match win streak and has become only the third player in the Open era to reach the Washington, Canada, Cincinnati and US Open finals in the same season, joining Ivan Lendl in 1982 and Andre Agassi in 1995. He\u2019s embraced his role as the villain of this tournament and rode the momentum all the way to the championship match. Not that Nadal isn\u2019t doing just fine himself. The 33-year-old Spaniard has won 26 of his last 27 matches, including a 6-3, 6-0 drubbing of Medvedev in last month\u2019s Montreal final. A win today would lift him to a 19th career major title, pulling within one of Roger Federer atop the all-time leaderboard. We should be under way in a little more than a half hour. Plenty more to come between now and then. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on today\u2019s final: Not for the first time, John McEnroe stirred the game into debate when he asserted that Roger Federer may finish his career with fewer grand slam titles than Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. \u201cWho would have thought that possible?\u201d the walking quote asked on air shortly before Nadal stilled the robust challenge of the 23-year-old Italian Matteo Berrettini on Friday night to reach the final of the US Open for the fifth time, against Daniil Medvedev on Sunday. The Spaniard has won three of his 18 majors on this court, Federer has won five of his 20 here \u2013 in a row, the last of them 11 years ago \u2013 and Djokovic, the world No 1, has lifted three of 16 at Flushing Meadows. Federer and Djokovic have left town: the Swiss spent and hurting with a bad back, the Serb forced to quit with a shoulder injury. Nadal, normally the member of the Big Three most susceptible to breakdown, is still standing and looking awesome again. But his ingrained sense of caution and respect would not allow him to entertain serious thoughts about moving to within one slam of Federer, who turned 38 three weeks ago, and push three clear of Djokovic.

      "body": "<p>In a final that had pretty much everything, Rafael Nadal turned back the challenge of the dazzling young Russian, Daniil Medvedev, in five sets here on Sunday night to win his fourth US Open and edge to within one slam of Roger Federer\u2019s collection of 20.</p> <p>But what a struggle it was. Medvedev, in his first grand slam final and not having won a five-setter in four attempts, announced his arrival with a performance of the highest daring; Nadal, the king of long-haul tennis, sent the message that, at 33, there is life in his legs and his heart yet.</p> <p>So, the Spaniard remains on schedule to pass his ageing Swiss friend after a 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 win against the fifth seed over four hours and 50 minutes \u2013 the longest match of the fortnight - on a warm evening in front of 24,000 bedazzled fans in the Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been an amazing final,\u201d said Nadal after the match. \u201c[Medvedev\u2019s] summer is one of the best in the sport since I started playing. The way that he was able to fight was just incredible. It was the most emotional night in my tennis career. The nerves were so high. It was a crazy match.\u201d</p> <p>Medvedev paid tribute to his opponent in his post-match interview. \u201cUnbelievable, outrageous, Rafa winning his 19th slam title It\u2019s amazing for our sport what you\u2019ve done. I fought for every point but unfortunately it didn\u2019t go my way,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At times, early on, it looked easy; mostly it did not \u2013 especially in the latter stages when Medvedev fashioned a revival from nowhere that rattled Nadal and won over New Yorkers who had booed his boorishness in the first week. They became converts to his cause midway through the third set, when Nadal botched a smash to let Medvedev back in the match and, in the fourth and fifth sets, where the players went shot-for-shot to the end.</p> <p>What had looked to be a routine win for Nadal ended in a riot of nerves and glorious shot-making, one of the best slam finals in years.</p> <p>Nadal has now won five majors since turning 30. If he were a wine, he\u2019d be a fine grand reserve rioja. His 19<sup>th </sup>major means the Big Three \u2013 Nadal, Federer and Novak Djokovic \u2013 have won 51 of the 59 played since he won his first in 2005. But Medvedev did his best to break the hegemony last breached by Stan Wawrinka, who beat Djokovic here in 2016.</p> <p>It was Nadal\u2019s 27<sup>th</sup> slam final, and he will be encouraged to believe there are more to come. He has never had much luck in Melbourne, although he won there in 2009, while Roland Garros, where he won his 12<sup>th</sup> French Open title this year, remains his banker, and he will have drawn comfort from reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon two months ago.</p> <p>Nadal has suffered more physically over the years than Federer or Djokovic, but he held everything together here just as they hobbled from the fray, injured. In the absence of the revered Swiss, Nadal was the crowd\u2019s early favourite against Medvedev, an ebullient performer with a bewildering arsenal of skills and a gift for winding up the crowd. They hated him at the start of the tournament for his on-court petulance and warmed to him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/04/us-open-tennis-bad-boys-rebels-daniil-medvedev-nick-kyrgios\">when he said he fed off their hostility</a>.</p> <p>Indeed, Medvedev paid tribute to the crowd after the match. \u201cBecause of your energy I was here in the final,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I can make mistakes. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, the court, the title and the tough New York crowd belonged to Nadal in the end. To put his win in context, Medvedev has won 12 matches in a row <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/11/bianca-andreescu-serena-williams-rogers-cup-tennis-final-tennis-rafael-nadal\">since losing 6-3, 6-0 in the Montreal Masters last month</a> \u2013 against Nadal.</p> <p>Nadal took eight minutes to hold at the start, saving his first break point as Medvedev applied educated pressure from the back of the court.</p> <p>The 23-year-old Russian is the youngest finalist here since Djokovic lost to Nadal in 2010. Nadal has tweaked his muscular tennis since that match, but he found Medvedev equal to many of his questions, and dropped serve in the third game with a limp forehand from deep.</p> <p>When he saw his opponent struggle with a wide slice at the end of a long rally in the fourth game, he forced a weary forehand from him to break back. Nadal held to love for 4-3 - and the crowd cheered when he changed his shirt.

      "bodyText": "In a final that had pretty much everything, Rafael Nadal turned back the challenge of the dazzling young Russian, Daniil Medvedev, in five sets here on Sunday night to win his fourth US Open and edge to within one slam of Roger Federer\u2019s collection of 20. But what a struggle it was. Medvedev, in his first grand slam final and not having won a five-setter in four attempts, announced his arrival with a performance of the highest daring; Nadal, the king of long-haul tennis, sent the message that, at 33, there is life in his legs and his heart yet. So, the Spaniard remains on schedule to pass his ageing Swiss friend after a 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 win against the fifth seed over four hours and 50 minutes \u2013 the longest match of the fortnight - on a warm evening in front of 24,000 bedazzled fans in the Arthur Ashe Stadium. \u201cIt has been an amazing final,\u201d said Nadal after the match. \u201c[Medvedev\u2019s] summer is one of the best in the sport since I started playing. The way that he was able to fight was just incredible. It was the most emotional night in my tennis career. The nerves were so high. It was a crazy match.\u201d Medvedev paid tribute to his opponent in his post-match interview. \u201cUnbelievable, outrageous, Rafa winning his 19th slam title It\u2019s amazing for our sport what you\u2019ve done. I fought for every point but unfortunately it didn\u2019t go my way,\u201d he said. At times, early on, it looked easy; mostly it did not \u2013 especially in the latter stages when Medvedev fashioned a revival from nowhere that rattled Nadal and won over New Yorkers who had booed his boorishness in the first week. They became converts to his cause midway through the third set, when Nadal botched a smash to let Medvedev back in the match and, in the fourth and fifth sets, where the players went shot-for-shot to the end. What had looked to be a routine win for Nadal ended in a riot of nerves and glorious shot-making, one of the best slam finals in years. Nadal has now won five majors since turning 30. If he were a wine, he\u2019d be a fine grand reserve rioja. His 19th major means the Big Three \u2013 Nadal, Federer and Novak Djokovic \u2013 have won 51 of the 59 played since he won his first in 2005. But Medvedev did his best to break the hegemony last breached by Stan Wawrinka, who beat Djokovic here in 2016. It was Nadal\u2019s 27th slam final, and he will be encouraged to believe there are more to come. He has never had much luck in Melbourne, although he won there in 2009, while Roland Garros, where he won his 12th French Open title this year, remains his banker, and he will have drawn comfort from reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon two months ago. Nadal has suffered more physically over the years than Federer or Djokovic, but he held everything together here just as they hobbled from the fray, injured. In the absence of the revered Swiss, Nadal was the crowd\u2019s early favourite against Medvedev, an ebullient performer with a bewildering arsenal of skills and a gift for winding up the crowd. They hated him at the start of the tournament for his on-court petulance and warmed to him when he said he fed off their hostility. Indeed, Medvedev paid tribute to the crowd after the match. \u201cBecause of your energy I was here in the final,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I can make mistakes. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.\u201d Nevertheless, the court, the title and the tough New York crowd belonged to Nadal in the end. To put his win in context, Medvedev has won 12 matches in a row since losing 6-3, 6-0 in the Montreal Masters last month \u2013 against Nadal. Nadal took eight minutes to hold at the start, saving his first break point as Medvedev applied educated pressure from the back of the court. The 23-year-old Russian is the youngest finalist here since Djokovic lost to Nadal in 2010. Nadal has tweaked his muscular tennis since that match, but he found Medvedev equal to many of his questions, and dropped serve in the third game with a limp forehand from deep. When he saw his opponent struggle with a wide slice at the end of a long rally in the fourth game, he forced a weary forehand from him to break back. Nadal held to love for 4-3 - and the crowd cheered when he changed his shirt. They never had the opportunity to do that with Federer. They began to warm to the gawky elegance of Medvedev, more heron than gazelle. Nadal held to love, with an ace, then ground down the Russian\u2019s serve with a mixture of spin and muscle off the ground. A teasing backhand forced the elastic Medvedev to twist in the air, but he could not control the difficult volley and the first set was gone in just over an hour. Nadal had to save break point to hold in the second, but the energy and momentum was with him and he forced a backhand error from Medvedev to go 4-2 up. The set was quickly in Nadal\u2019s pocket. Medvedev, who had been half in the contest, half out, came to life when he recovered from a break to parity in the sixth game of the third, then launched a rousing fightback. The Russian turned the mob into hysterical fans when he broke to force a fourth set. Nadal suddenly was under intense pressure, saving break point in the second game. There was little in it for the next 50 minutes, but Nadal, trailing in the serving cycle, was the one hanging on in many rallies, and Medvedev grabbed set point, clinching it with an extraordinary winner off his first serve. Then several twists significantly altered the drama. In the second game of the fifth, the crowd suddenly turned on Nadal, who complained they were interrupting him; Medvedev then had the trainer on to massage his left thigh; and, three games later, Nadal broke from 40-0 down after a closing 28-shot rally that left Medvedev spent. Now Nadal was in the same position as in the third set, when he butchered that smash. This time after putting the simplest of volleys into the net at 40-0, he held, tapping a backhand away for 4-2. Medvedev smashed long and Nadal served for the championship. Then came more Medvedev magic as he scrambled a break point \u2013 at which point Nadal lost his serve when the shot clock timed him out. Serving to keep the match alive, Medvedev couldn\u2019t reach a drop shot and Nadal had match point after four hours and 38 minutes. A blizzard of mistakes and winners followed, Medvedev survived and Nadal went to the service line again. He cut it fine with the shot clock a couple of times again, framed a forehand to hand Medvedev a break point, but the Russian hit long. Nadal drop-shotted at deuce, a seriously brave move, and was back on match point for the third time. Medvedev hit long again and it was done. The last time Nadal saw off a Russian prospect here \u2013 19-year-old Andrey Rublev two years ago in the quarter-finals \u2013 the Spaniard, 31 at the time, said, \u201cI always wanted to be young. Even when I was eight years old, I was not very happy to be nine. I don\u2019t want to get older. For the moment, I didn\u2019t find the way to stop that watch.\u201d Maybe he did.",
