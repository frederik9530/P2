He is now in remission, but felt his chances of getting back into the workforce were grim. \u201cI\u2019m finding once people see a hole in your resume of even a few months and they ask why, and you tell them, they tend to shy off a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to take the risk of employing someone who\u2019s been that sick and of you getting sick again.\u201d Naujokas, who has relied on Centrelink on and off for more than decade, said it was ridiculous to suggest Newstart was \u201ctransitional\u201d. \u201cEveryone I know who has been on Newstart for a long time and it\u2019s not because they aren\u2019t trying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe jobs just aren\u2019t there.\u201d The growing cohort of long-term Newstart recipients was likely a result of policy changes that denied higher-paying pensions to disabled people and single parents, as well as the increasing number of older Australians who were now unemployed, campaigners said. \u201cIf you have an illness or disability, or you are caring for children, you are likely to spend longer periods of time on income support because you may not be able to work, or cannot find suitable paid employment,\u201d said Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service. She added: \u201cNewstart is not enough for anyone, whether you receive it for one week, one year or five.\u201d Labor\u2019s social services spokeswoman, Linda Burney, accused the government of being \u201cclearly misleading\u201d by calling Newstart a transitional payment. The Greens\u2019 Rachel Siewert, who is charing an inquiry into the payment, said: \u201cThis shows that it\u2019s not a transition payment, it shows that people are on there long term, and we know that poverty in itself is a barrier on top of all the other barriers people may be facing to work.\u201d A spokesperson for the social services minister, Anne Ruston, pointed to figures showing the proportion of Australians receiving working-age income support payments had fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. \u201cBut in accepting positive results we acknowledge that some indicators are showing there is more work to be done in some areas which the government is determined to address,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThat is why we are so focused on investing in programs that break down barriers that some unemployed Australians face getting into the workforce, particularly those at risk of long-term welfare dependency.\u201d The spokesperson also said two-thirds of new recipients of Newstart were off the payment in 12 months, a figure that is almost unchanged since 2014.",

The unit will bring together six universities and charities across the UK and the US to share expertise, ideas and resources to increase the scale of research. The hope is to improve understanding of how cancer arises, develop tests and imaging techniques and design clinical trials to speedily bring innovations to the public. The earlier cancers are detected, the easier they can be treated and the better the chance of survival. At present, there are routine screening programmes in the UK for bowel, breast and cervical cancer, while targeted screening for lung cancer is being piloted. But while experts say these programmes save lives there is more to be done: current methods do not pick up all cases while for many cancers no screening technologies exist. \u201cThere\u2019s still a major unmet need,\u201d said Prof David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, which is part of the alliance and is contributing \u00a340m over the next five years. \u201cIn fact around half of cancers are still diagnosed at an advanced stage and the outcomes for those people are very poor.\u201d The \u00a355m collaboration, dubbed the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED), will also delve into knotty issues such as why many people skip screening appointments, and explore how new techniques can be made easily accessible. \u201cWith this alliance one of the things that we are very committed to is taking things all the way through from the bench to the bedside,\u201d said Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald of the University of Cambridge, another of the UK institutions. There are even hopes it might one day be possible to offer a tailored approach to prevention whether through surgery or drugs.\u201cThere could eventually be drugs that we can give you that nip things in the bud because we can predict what is likely to go wrong in you,\u201d said Crosby. The alliance is looking to develop simple detection techniques based on blood, urine or even nasal swab samples, as well as working with sophisticated imaging techniques such as hyperpolarised MRI \u2013 this allows researchers to investigate how cancer cells generate energy and is showing promise in prostate cancer research. Prof Robert Bristow of the University of Manchester, which is also part of the alliance, said another project involves collecting pre-cancerous cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells from individuals with tissues at high risk of cancer and 3D printing them.

The researchers acknowledged that some routine screening programmes, including for breast cancer, have been criticised for over diagnosis \u2013 a situation where cancers that would not have caused harm are found, often leading to unnecessary treatment. However, they say the alliance will explore techniques that will be better able to find problematic cancers, and distinguish them from those that are harmless \u2013 such as the use of MRI imaging to detect prostate cancer rather than traditional biopsies. They are also looking at ways to identify people at high or low risk of certain cancers, meaning those at high risk could be offered more frequent screening than those at low risk. The announcement of the alliance comes just weeks after it was found that cancer survival rates in the UK, while improving, are lagging behind those of other countries such as Norway, Canada and Australia.

Since these avoidable deaths are happening now, not in 2025 or 2050, together we need to act now.\u201d</p> <p>Previous studies have found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/10/air-pollution-linked-to-spikes-in-hospital-and-gp-visits\">spikes in hospital admissions</a> and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.</p> <p>The researchers defined high pollution days by dividing the year in two based on levels of pollution and comparing the number of cases of the relevant illness in the higher pollution half of the year with the number of similar cases on each day in the lower half.</p> <p>The data, collated by King\u2019s College London (KCL), covers London, where there are 338 more emergencies a year on higher pollution days compared with low pollution days, Birmingham (65 a year), Bristol (22), Derby (16), Liverpool (28), Manchester (34), Nottingham (19), Oxford (10) and Southampton (16).</p> <p>Much of the recent research on air pollution has focused on the lifelong effects of chronic exposure, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/air-pollution-causes-jump-in-dementia-risk-study-suggests\">cognitive decline</a>, stunted growth in children and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/03/toxic-air-will-shorten-childrens-lives-by-20-months-study-reveals\">premature death</a>. However, it can also bring on serious illness more immediately.</p> <p>Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cMany people may not realise how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/04/report-links-childs-asthma-death-to-illegal-levels-of-air-pollution\">dangerous air pollution at high levels can be</a>, and that it can trigger heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks as well as having long-term health effects. These figures will be a wake-up call for city leaders to take the strongest possible action.\u201d</p> <p>The government has pledged to tackle air pollution in its environment bill, proposals for which were laid out after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/14/jeremy-corbyn-hits-out-at-farcical-queens-speech\">the Queen\u2019s speech</a>. Campaigners are concerned that the measures proposed are too vague and too weak.</p> <p>Polly Billington, the director of UK100, a network of local government leaders across England that have pledged to shift wholly to clean energy by 2050, said: \u201cWe would like to see World Health Organization air pollution standards included in the bill, as they are widely seen as gold standard, with a legally binding timetable to meet them, as that creates certainty and enables long-term planning.

      "bodyText": "Scores of children and adults are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, figures show. Each year emergency services see more than 120 additional cardiac arrests, more than 230 additional strokes and nearly 200 more people with asthma requiring hospital treatment on days of high pollution compared with the average on days of lower pollution. The data, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain that poor air quality is putting on already stretched NHS emergency resources. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said: \u201cThese new figures show air pollution is now causing thousands of strokes, cardiac arrests and asthma attacks, so it\u2019s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency. Since these avoidable deaths are happening now, not in 2025 or 2050, together we need to act now.\u201d Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air. The researchers defined high pollution days by dividing the year in two based on levels of pollution and comparing the number of cases of the relevant illness in the higher pollution half of the year with the number of similar cases on each day in the lower half. The data, collated by King\u2019s College London (KCL), covers London, where there are 338 more emergencies a year on higher pollution days compared with low pollution days, Birmingham (65 a year), Bristol (22), Derby (16), Liverpool (28), Manchester (34), Nottingham (19), Oxford (10) and Southampton (16). Much of the recent research on air pollution has focused on the lifelong effects of chronic exposure, including cognitive decline, stunted growth in children and premature death. However, it can also bring on serious illness more immediately. Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cMany people may not realise how dangerous air pollution at high levels can be, and that it can trigger heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks as well as having long-term health effects. These figures will be a wake-up call for city leaders to take the strongest possible action.\u201d The government has pledged to tackle air pollution in its environment bill, proposals for which were laid out after the Queen\u2019s speech. Campaigners are concerned that the measures proposed are too vague and too weak. Polly Billington, the director of UK100, a network of local government leaders across England that have pledged to shift wholly to clean energy by 2050, said: \u201cWe would like to see World Health Organization air pollution standards included in the bill, as they are widely seen as gold standard, with a legally binding timetable to meet them, as that creates certainty and enables long-term planning. The absence of significantly increased powers for local leaders, together with a lack of reference to the need for adequate funding, are the big holes in the bill that will hold action back.\u201d On Wednesday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and UK100 will hold an international clean air summit with the World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Tedros Adhanom. Heather Walton, a health expert with the environmental research group at KCL, said the study was intended to provide more detail than others that have tended to concentrate on the effects of air pollution on life expectancy, such as estimates that pollution contributes to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK. By homing in on hospital admissions for cardiac arrests, strokes and asthma, the researchers were able to provide a clearer picture of the acute impacts on people and how emergency services are affected. \u201cThis provides additional evidence of the important need for further action to reduce air pollution,\u201d Walton said. Bates said clean air zones were needed, but also measures to cut all traffic \u201cbecause all vehicles produce deadly fine particle air pollution from brake and tyre wear. This way the air pollution health crisis and the climate emergency can be addressed together, helping to make our cities and towns healthier and more attractive.\u201d The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe are taking urgent action to improve air quality and tackle pollution so people can live longer healthier lives. Our landmark environment bill will set ambitious, legally binding targets to reduce fine particulate matter and increase local powers to address key sources of air pollution. \u201cWe are already working hard to reduce transport emissions and are investing \u00a33.5bn to clean up our air, while our clean air strategy has been praised by the WHO as an example for the rest of the world to follow.\u201d Last week Europe\u2019s environmental watchdog found that little or no progress had been made across Europe on cutting levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is one of the most dangerous forms of pollution because it can lodge deep in the lungs and penetrate the bloodstream.",

      "body": "<p>A standing-room-only train journey down to Ascot on Saturday afforded plenty of time to consider both the continuing popularity of British Champions Day eight years after its arrival in the calendar, and the woeful inability of South West Trains to offer an adequate service on a day that has drawn a bigger crowd than the King George in July every year since 2014. The final attendance figure of 29,029 - a fair proportion of whom seemed to be in my carriage \u2013 was a few hundred down on 2018, but still impressive given a very mixed weather forecast for the afternoon and, if we\u2019re honest, a slight lack of \u201cstar\u201d names in the Group One events when compared to some previous years.</p> \n<p>In the end, this made no difference to anyone, just as the decision to switch three races to the hurdles went unnoticed as soon as Kew Gardens and Stradivarius settled down to battle it out in the Long Distance Cup. Never mind the weather or the cast list, a crowd of around 30,000 for Champions Day is now apparently guaranteed - a huge increase on the 12,500 who saw the last Champion Stakes at Newmarket in 2010.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/magical-battles-win-first-champion-stakes-aidan-o-brien-champions-day-ascot-horse-racing\">Magical battles home to win first Champion Stakes at Ascot for Aidan O\u2019Brien</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Just over 32,000 were at Ascot to see Frankel conclude his flawless career in the same race two years later, a Champions Day record that is unlikely to be beaten any time soon. But at the same time, this could be seen as evidence that the old argument that \u201chorses like Frankel are the lifeblood of the sport\u201d is slightly wide of the mark. They make a difference, for sure, but perhaps not quite as big a difference as some might suggest.</p> \n<p>Champions Day has built up a loyal, reliable attendance of around 30,000 people from pretty much a standing start, and done it less than 10 years. And while Frankel was undoubtedly a big draw in the early years, the success of subsequent seasons is down to a major investment in branding and marketing which has built on Ascot\u2019s status as the top Flat track in the country.</p> \n<p>There was a strong sense on that overcrowded train on Saturday that most of the people on it were not just going to the races.

      "bodyText": "A standing-room-only train journey down to Ascot on Saturday afforded plenty of time to consider both the continuing popularity of British Champions Day eight years after its arrival in the calendar, and the woeful inability of South West Trains to offer an adequate service on a day that has drawn a bigger crowd than the King George in July every year since 2014. The final attendance figure of 29,029 - a fair proportion of whom seemed to be in my carriage \u2013 was a few hundred down on 2018, but still impressive given a very mixed weather forecast for the afternoon and, if we\u2019re honest, a slight lack of \u201cstar\u201d names in the Group One events when compared to some previous years. In the end, this made no difference to anyone, just as the decision to switch three races to the hurdles went unnoticed as soon as Kew Gardens and Stradivarius settled down to battle it out in the Long Distance Cup. Never mind the weather or the cast list, a crowd of around 30,000 for Champions Day is now apparently guaranteed - a huge increase on the 12,500 who saw the last Champion Stakes at Newmarket in 2010. Just over 32,000 were at Ascot to see Frankel conclude his flawless career in the same race two years later, a Champions Day record that is unlikely to be beaten any time soon. But at the same time, this could be seen as evidence that the old argument that \u201chorses like Frankel are the lifeblood of the sport\u201d is slightly wide of the mark. They make a difference, for sure, but perhaps not quite as big a difference as some might suggest. Champions Day has built up a loyal, reliable attendance of around 30,000 people from pretty much a standing start, and done it less than 10 years. And while Frankel was undoubtedly a big draw in the early years, the success of subsequent seasons is down to a major investment in branding and marketing which has built on Ascot\u2019s status as the top Flat track in the country. There was a strong sense on that overcrowded train on Saturday that most of the people on it were not just going to the races. They were going to Ascot races, because the name comes with something close to a guarantee of exciting, competitive action in a historic venue. The Ascot brand sells the day as much as the promise of \u201cChampions\u201d. On that basis, a horse like Magical, the Champion Stakes winner, is as important for the event as a freakish once-in-a-lifetime superstar like Frankel. Champions Day is the third of four big end-of-season events in the northern hemisphere in the space of eight weeks, starting with Champions Weekend in Ireland and moving on to Ascot via Arc day in Paris before the Breeders\u2019 Cup (which returns this year to Santa Anita in California, always a big favourite with owners and trainers alike). Few horses are sufficiently robust and reliable to run up to their best at all four \u2013 Found, like Magical a filly from the Aidan O\u2019Brien stable, is the only recent example that springs to mind. And Magical could well prove to be another, with the Filly &amp; Mare Turf pencilled in for her final start of the season if she comes out of Saturday\u2019s race as fresh and keen as she has after her previous eight outings this year. With Champions Day falling between the Arc and the Breeders\u2019 Cup and ground on the softer side of good likely if the first nine seasons are any guide, owners and trainers are always likely to feel that if it is a choice of two from three, France and then America gives their horses more time to recover. Horses that are able to take their races as Magical does are invaluable in terms of maintaining the quality of the big autumn meetings, and while, unlike Frankel, she will never get a statue at Ascot, she did just as he did on Saturday to maintain the success of Britain\u2019s richest day at the races. Monday\u2019s best bets Windsor closes its doors for another winter after its seven-race card this afternoon, and its balmy midsummer Monday evenings will feel like a very distant memory as the runners slosh round on rain-softened ground. The conditions may detract somewhat from the spectacle, but Field Of Vision (2.00) should appreciate the test having put up his best run for a while on heavy ground at Leicester last time out. Prince Of Harts (4.00) also ran well on soft at Nottingham back in May and could reward an interest at around 9-2 later on the card, while Milan Reef (5.00) is another who should relish the conditions if handicaps for gentleman amateur riders\u2019 are your thing. The curtain is coming down at Pontefract too, where Glasses Up (3.20) should go well at around 8-1 as he steps back up to a mile-and-a-quarter after a promising run over a mile at Musselburgh last time. King Carney (3.50) improved markedly to get off the mark on soft ground at Nottingham earlier this month and registered a decent time in the process, so 8-1 could be a price worth taking for the card\u2019s feature race, while Magen\u2019s Moon (3.10) can follow up her surprise win over course and distance last time out in the handicap hurdle at Plumpton.",

It has called for the right to challenge government applications for warrants against journalists, exemptions for journalists to laws that would see them jailed for doing their job, legislated protections for public sector whistleblowers, and reforms to both freedom of information and defamation laws. It also calls for a new regime to limit which documents can be stamped as secret. The Australian parliament has passed more than 60 laws relating to secrecy and spying in the past 20 years. It is currently reviewing whistleblower laws. Twenty-two have been passed in the past two years. \u201cThe truth is, those in power don\u2019t want the public to know what they\u2019re up to and are shutting down transparency and accountability to serve their own interests,\u201d the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. A survey conducted by the Australian Right to Know coalition in October found that while 87% of respondents said it was important that Australia be a free, open and transparent democracy, only 37% felt that currently described Australia. Eighty-eight per cent of respondents agreed that people who call out wrongdoing are critical to keeping the government accountable and should be protected, and 80% said whistleblowers should not be treated like criminals even if they broke the law to tell the truth. A further 76% said journalists should be protected from prosecution and imprisonment when they report on information the public has a right to know about, and only 35% said the government was keeping them as informed as possible about that kind of information. A majority of people said they had the right to know if the federal government was considering new powers to allow an intelligence agency to collect information on Australian citizens, an issue for which News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst\u2019s home was raided by the Australian federal police in June. Respondents also said they had a right to know about reports of abuse in aged care homes, and about foreign companies selling private land. The federal department of health last year refused requests about aged care complaints to a Four Corners investigation. A request by the Age to the Foreign Investment Review Board for information about a $415m sale of forestry land to a Canadian superannuation fund was also refused, leading to a two-year battle before the information commissioner and the final release of freedom of information documents so heavily redacted that the story could not be published. Respondents to the survey also said the government was less transparent on a majority of key issues \u2013 including political campaign funding, climate change and immigration \u2013 than it was a decade ago. Australia does not require real-time disclosure of political donations. An investigation by Guardian Australia found that the Tasmanian Liberal party received a $500,000 donation from the gambling lobby before the 2018 election, in which Labor was campaigning on an anti-gambling platform, but the source of the donation was not disclosed until 11 months after the polls closed. The Liberal party won the election. Even the most innocuous requests for a copy of the menu of the members\u2019 dining room in Parliament House have been refused. Journalist William Summers was eventually granted the menus on the condition that he never published them.",

      "bodyText": "Marco Silva has claimed he never worried about the pressure mounting on his job at Everton because his conscience was clear that he was giving everything to correct the team\u2019s faltering campaign. Everton enjoyed their first Premier League win in five matches on Saturday with a deserved 2-0 defeat of West Ham and a performance that vindicated several of their manager\u2019s decisions, including recalls for Bernard, Tom Davies and Theo Walcott, Richarlison at centre-forward and Alex Iwobi over Gylfi Sigurdsson in the No 10 role. Silva was under fierce pressure following a run of four league defeats that had left Everton in the relegation zone, yet he instructed his players to perform with freedom and to enjoy themselves against Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s disappointing side. He was rewarded with a more convincing victory than the scoreline suggests and insisted the criticism never affected him. \u201cEvery day I go home with my conscience really clear because I know I did my best to put my players at the best level I can,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI give my 100% best to Everton every day. Always. My players know that. Why would I be nervous? I am not. \u201cEverything I have in my life comes from football. I work really hard and I received many good things when I was a young manager. I have my career behind me and in the future as well. Football games are about preparing your players in a good way and to enjoy as well. I was not nervous at all.\u201d Silva held frank discussions with his underperforming players in the build-up to West Ham\u2019s visit and made five changes to the team beaten at Burnley before the international break. Bernard marked his return with the opening goal before Sigurdsson, on as a late substitute, sealed victory with an emphatic finish. The Everton manager said: \u201cWe have these chats in good and bad moments. My message to them was clear and they understood. When I see them perform in this way that is the most important thing for me because I am trying to build something in our football club. Last season we had some very good moments but I want more consistency. The chat was good and the message to them was clear. You have to tell the truth to your players. You can\u2019t go around the issue. You have to tell the truth to players even if the truth is not so good.\u201d Walcott, 30, impressed in only his second start of the season, assisting for Bernard\u2019s opener, and he claimed Silva\u2019s calmness lifted the tension from a game the Portuguese had labelled a must-win. \u201cThe manager stressed that he wanted us to play with freedom and he took the pressure off us completely,\u201d the former Arsenal forward said. \u201cIt was about enjoyment, not worrying about the game.\u201d He admitted recent criticism was not only justified but served to underline the expectation at Goodison Park and the status of the club. \u201cWe are the players who go across that white line and where we have been in the league is just not Everton at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure we have been under is sort of a good thing because it shows just how big this club is and where we should be. \u201cEveryone is disappointed when you see us in the bottom three before the game.

The Rockets picked Rashid Kahn. The Northern Superchargers went for Aaron Finch, the Welsh Fire Steve Smith. The Southern Braves picked Andre Russell, to the delight of Jofra, and no doubt the TV schedulers in search of some early firepower.</p> \n<p>In between there was an announcement of some key women\u2019s Hundred players. Meg Lanning went to the Fire, Alyssa Healy to the Superchargers, England duo and recently married couple Nat Sciver and Katherine Brunt will play for the Rockets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fc731f49-ce84-449f-b427-45b5c671ec8b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Trent Rockets</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England Test central contract</b> Joe Root<b>; \u00a3125,000 </b>Rashid Khan (overseas)<b>; \u00a3125,000</b> D'Arcy Short (overseas; <b>\u00a3100,000 </b>Lewis Gregory<b>; \u00a3100,000</b> Alex Hales (local icon)<b>; \u00a375,000 </b>Nathan Coulter-Nile (overseas);<b> \u00a375,000 </b>Harry Gurney (local icon)<b>; \u00a360,000</b> Steven Mullaney<b>; \u00a360,000</b> Matthew Carter<b>; \u00a350,000 </b>Luke Wood<b>; \u00a350,000 </b>Tom Moores;<b> \u00a340,000 </b>Dawid Malan; <b>\u00a340,000 </b>Ben Cox;<b> \u00a330,000 </b>Luke Fletcher; <b>\u00a330,000 </b>Luke Wright</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Southern Brave</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England Test central contract </b>Jofra Archer; <b>\u00a3125,000</b> Andre Russell (overseas); <b>\u00a3125,000</b> David Warner (overseas); <b>\u00a3100,000 </b>Liam Dawson; <b>\u00a3100,000</b> James Vince (local icon); <b>\u00a375,000</b> Shadab Khan (overseas); <b>\u00a375,000 </b>Chris Jordan (local icon); <b>\u00a360,000</b> Tymal Mills; <b>\u00a360,000 </b>Ross Whiteley; <b>\u00a350,000 </b>Delray Rawlins; <b>\u00a350,000</b> Ollie Pope; <b>\u00a340,000 </b>George Garton; <b>\u00a340,000</b> Alex Davies<b>\u00a330,000</b> Max Waller<b>; \u00a330,000 </b>Craig Overton</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Northern Superchargers</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England Test central contract</b> Ben Stokes<b>; \u00a3125,000</b> Aaron Finch (overseas)<b>; \u00a3125,000 </b>Mujeeb Ur Rahman (overseas); <b>\u00a3100,000 </b>Chris Lynn (overseas); <b>\u00a3100,000</b> Adil Rashid (local icon); <b>\u00a375,000</b> Adam Lyth <b>\u00a375,000 </b>David Willey (local icon); <b>\u00a360,000 </b>Richard Gleeson;<b>\u00a360,000</b> Ben Foakes; <b>\u00a350,000</b> Tom Kohler-Cadmore<b>; \u00a350,000</b> David Wiese; <b>\u00a340,000 </b>Nathan Rimmington; <b>\u00a340,000</b> Brydon Carse; <b>\u00a330,000</b> Ed Barnard; <b>\u00a330,000</b>John Simpson</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Welsh Fire</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England Test central contract </b>Jonny Bairstow<b>; \u00a3125,000 </b>Mitchell Starc (overseas); <b>\u00a3125,000 </b>Steve Smith (overseas)<b>; \u00a3100,000</b> Colin Ingram (local icon)<b>; \u00a3100,000</b>Tom Banton (local icon); <b>\u00a375,000</b> Ben Duckett<b>; \u00a375,000</b> Ravi Rampaul<b>; \u00a360,000</b> Simon Harmer; <b>\u00a360,000 </b>Qais Ahmed (overseas); <b>\u00a350,000 </b>Liam Plunkett; <b>\u00a350,000 </b>Ryan ten Doeschate<b>; \u00a340,000 </b>David Payne<b>; \u00a340,000</b> Ryan Higgins<b>; \u00a330,000 </b>Danny Briggs; <b>\u00a330,000 </b>Leus du Plooy</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Oval Invicibles</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England Test central contract</b> Sam Curran<b>; \u00a3125,000</b> Sunil Narine (overseas); <b>\u00a3125,000</b>Jason Roy (local icon); <b>\u00a3100,000 </b>Sam Billings; <b>\u00a3100,000 </b>Sandeep Lamichhane (overseas); <b>\u00a375,000 </b>Rilee Rossouw; <b>\u00a375,000</b> Tom Curran (local icon); <b>\u00a360,000</b>Reece Topley<b> \u00a360,000</b> Hardus Viljoen; <b>\u00a350,000</b> Fabian Allen (overseas)<b>; \u00a350,000 </b>Alex Blake; <b>\u00a340,000</b> Will Jacks<b>; \u00a340,000 </b>Chris Wood<b>; \u00a330,000</b> Nathan Sowter; <b>\u00a330,000 </b>Laurie Evans</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As the draft played out it became clear one side-effect would be a degree of wastage at the top end.

      "bodyText": "Roll up. Roll up for the mystery tour. On a night of fevered transactional tension at the Sky TV studio complex English cricket rolled out its latest vision of the future. \u201cWe\u2019re on the clock and we\u2019re under way,\u201d Ian Ward announced into the camera just before 7pm, firing the starter\u2019s pistol on the inaugural men\u2019s Hundred Draft. Behind him the lighted plinths, the sheer black underway, the thrillingly smooth surfaces of the new crickertainment future stretched out. This was the look of The Draft from the start, a mix of sporting theatre, election night glam and high-end gameshow. The model here isn\u2019t Peter West in his high-backed chair or Tony Lewis waggling his eyebrows. It\u2019s light entertainment, with a nod to those Sunday night, sequin-spangled, dance-off segments. \u201cTrent Rockets, you are on the clock now\u2026NOW!!\u201d Isa Guha announced as the cameras cut to the franchise coaches hunched behind their rostrums. Even this was a power play, a lineup of unarguable A-listers, including the great Shane himself, perched at the London Spirit desk and looking, as ever, both gorgeously ravaged and gorgeously primped and styled. Warne had been an early voice of derision about the Hundred, now miraculously persuaded to become the head coach of one its franchises. To be fair, he did a pretty good job here of looking engaged and excited and \u2013 crucially \u2013 as though he knew what was going on, although the cameras did at one stage seem to show he had his phone on the desk in front of him (\u201cSiri, who the bloody hell is Daryn Smit?\u201d). To their credit both the ECB and Sky were all-in here. An hour before the start the main posse of England players could be seen rolling into town, consciously dressed down in hoodies and high tops, looking like the slightly grizzled end scene from a Blazin\u2019 Squad reunion documentary. Inside a raft of global A-listers basked on white leather sofas. There was Jofra in a pair of impressively huge trainers and Moeen Ali kicking back with all the live TV \u00e9lan of a man about to be fed to the castle crocodiles. It made for an engaging piece of contrived TV theatre, albeit based largely around reading out the names of cricketers. The Rockets picked Rashid Kahn. The Northern Superchargers went for Aaron Finch, the Welsh Fire Steve Smith. The Southern Braves picked Andre Russell, to the delight of Jofra, and no doubt the TV schedulers in search of some early firepower. In between there was an announcement of some key women\u2019s Hundred players. Meg Lanning went to the Fire, Alyssa Healy to the Superchargers, England duo and recently married couple Nat Sciver and Katherine Brunt will play for the Rockets. As the draft played out it became clear one side-effect would be a degree of wastage at the top end. The player list had promised us Chris Gayle, Kagiso Rabada and Lasith Malinga in the top price bracket. In the event we didn\u2019t get any of them. Instead Liam Livingstone went to the Birmingham Phoenix for double his reserve price. There were major deals for Phil Salt and Tom Abell. Sam Billings, the most Kentish man in Kent, will play for the Oval Invincibles. Ravi Bopara, star of the Blast, went to Birmingham Phoenix. Shakib Al-Hasan, the world\u2019s top T20 all-rounder over the last few years, went unsold to any of the eight franchises. And so it rolled on, opening gambit in either the stupidest event ever staged in the history of English sport, or a refreshingly bold reimagining, depending on your point of view.

      "body": "<p>When Warren Gatland said Kyle Sinckler had \u201ca few demons to deal with\u201d after Wales\u2019s Six Nations victory over England in February he was no doubt smiling inside. His plan had worked, because although Sinckler had played for an hour like a man possessed he ultimately lost his cool, as Gatland had predicted, having described the England prop as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/21/warren-gatland-wales-england-six-nations-kyle-sinckler-emotional-timebomb\" title=\"\">an \u201cemotional time-bomb\u201d beforehand</a>.</p> <p>Eight months on and the enduring image is Sinckler\u2019s smile. It started even before he had splashed over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/england-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">against Australia</a> for his first England try and beamed as he lay flat on top of the ball in celebration. Perhaps the most relevant part of Sinckler\u2019s performance was, however, his refusal to bite on Australian bait. He was offered ample opportunity, the Wallabies often patting him on the head if a scrum decision went against him or chirping in his ear, trying to push his buttons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/weve-not-played-our-best-england-can-improve-eddie-jones-tells-new-zealand\">\u2018We\u2019ve not played our best\u2019: England can improve, Eddie Jones tells New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Sinckler has spent the past six months dealing with his demons. He feels he let his country down against Wales and does not want to experience that sensation again. He traces his anger back to childhood and the absence of a strong father figure. And he acknowledges that growing up in south London in a single-parent home, raised by his mother Donna, who was at Saturday\u2019s match, gave him a misguided view on \u201chow to be a man\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy frustrations were nothing rugby-related,\u201d Sinckler says. \u201cI was born in a single-parent home, I was always looking for that male father figure. Subconsciously, I put people in that position, put my trust in certain people who betrayed me. It was just about me taking control of my life and teaching me how to be an actual man.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57e4ec1bbf383021bde2a5026a64eb4b9df529fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e4ec1bbf383021bde2a5026a64eb4b9df529fd/0_122_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Sinckler, left, and fellow England prop Joe Marler celebrate the victory over Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Sinckler, left, and fellow England prop Joe Marler celebrate the victory over Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA man is in control of his emotions, a man looks after his family, he does the right things. He doesn\u2019t let anything that frustrates him show; he just gets on with it. That is something I\u2019ve really tried to work on because I know my behaviour in the past has cost the team and I didn\u2019t want to feel like that again. I had to look within and help. It\u2019s working for me, but it\u2019s been tough.\u201d</p> <p>Sinckler concedes that six months ago, Australia\u2019s attempts to rile him might have sent him into a rage. He credits Ollie Pryce-Tidd, who works for an organisation that specialises in men\u2019s wellbeing called Saviour World, for his calmer outlook. Pryce-Tidd has also worked with Australia\u2019s James O\u2019Connor and there was a knowing exchange between the pair after the match.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been quite frustrated,\u201d Sinckler said. \u201cRugby is my canvas. I\u2019ve always expressed myself through it. So I\u2019ve had to deal with a lot of things I was probably frustrated about in my life and address them. I\u2019ve been working really hard with someone to address those things off the field, things that happened in my childhood. And then once I got a better understanding of that stuff I had no frustrations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/19/sam-underhill-tom-curry-england-australia\">Dynamic duo Sam Underhill and Tom Curry give England comic-book gusto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about belief.

      "bodyText": "When Warren Gatland said Kyle Sinckler had \u201ca few demons to deal with\u201d after Wales\u2019s Six Nations victory over England in February he was no doubt smiling inside. His plan had worked, because although Sinckler had played for an hour like a man possessed he ultimately lost his cool, as Gatland had predicted, having described the England prop as an \u201cemotional time-bomb\u201d beforehand. Eight months on and the enduring image is Sinckler\u2019s smile. It started even before he had splashed over against Australia for his first England try and beamed as he lay flat on top of the ball in celebration. Perhaps the most relevant part of Sinckler\u2019s performance was, however, his refusal to bite on Australian bait. He was offered ample opportunity, the Wallabies often patting him on the head if a scrum decision went against him or chirping in his ear, trying to push his buttons. But Sinckler has spent the past six months dealing with his demons. He feels he let his country down against Wales and does not want to experience that sensation again. He traces his anger back to childhood and the absence of a strong father figure. And he acknowledges that growing up in south London in a single-parent home, raised by his mother Donna, who was at Saturday\u2019s match, gave him a misguided view on \u201chow to be a man\u201d. \u201cMy frustrations were nothing rugby-related,\u201d Sinckler says. \u201cI was born in a single-parent home, I was always looking for that male father figure. Subconsciously, I put people in that position, put my trust in certain people who betrayed me. It was just about me taking control of my life and teaching me how to be an actual man. \u201cA man is in control of his emotions, a man looks after his family, he does the right things. He doesn\u2019t let anything that frustrates him show; he just gets on with it. That is something I\u2019ve really tried to work on because I know my behaviour in the past has cost the team and I didn\u2019t want to feel like that again. I had to look within and help. It\u2019s working for me, but it\u2019s been tough.\u201d Sinckler concedes that six months ago, Australia\u2019s attempts to rile him might have sent him into a rage. He credits Ollie Pryce-Tidd, who works for an organisation that specialises in men\u2019s wellbeing called Saviour World, for his calmer outlook. Pryce-Tidd has also worked with Australia\u2019s James O\u2019Connor and there was a knowing exchange between the pair after the match. \u201cI\u2019ve always been quite frustrated,\u201d Sinckler said. \u201cRugby is my canvas. I\u2019ve always expressed myself through it. So I\u2019ve had to deal with a lot of things I was probably frustrated about in my life and address them. I\u2019ve been working really hard with someone to address those things off the field, things that happened in my childhood. And then once I got a better understanding of that stuff I had no frustrations. \u201cIt\u2019s all about belief. A lot of people, when I was growing up, said I couldn\u2019t do a lot of things, that I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything. I was lucky to have a good family around me, a good group of friends who supported me and never really allowed me to get in trouble and steered me in the right direction. They were good role models. \u201cLook at the stuff that\u2019s happening with knife crime. It\u2019s just because kids are bored, sitting around. When I was a kid I had training, I was playing football, rugby, cricket, I was doing kick-boxing, karate. I didn\u2019t have time to think about doing something bad. \u201cAt the moment kids are sitting around and they want that adrenaline rush. They need to fall in love with some kind of sport, some kind of activity. Where I\u2019m from there\u2019s a big onus on me to set a good example and show what being a man is. A man isn\u2019t losing your rag, your emotions, showing your opposition how you really feel. It\u2019s about being calm, being disciplined, putting the team first, doing your job and not allowing your ego to take control.\u201d Sinckler now turns his attention to a semi-final against New Zealand. It was two years ago against the All Blacks that Sinckler broke through on the international stage with the British &amp; Irish Lions but things got the better of him after their second Test win and tempers flared with a number of All Blacks. Sinckler is confident history will not repeat itself. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got a real big responsibility for the team, and not only the team, the people watching back home, especially people where I come from,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to leave a good example for them, show them how to play the game.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is known to many opponents as the troll in the Oval Office, but the woman he beat for the most powerful seat in the world seems to have learned something from his willingness to tweet provocative pictures and memes. On Sunday afternoon, Hillary Clinton tweeted a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev that was meant squarely to mock a real letter from Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan which was revealed to the public this week. \u201cFound in the archives,\u201d Clinton wrote, over an image of what purported to be a letter from the US president to the Soviet leader on 16 October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. \u201cDear Premier Khrushchev,\u201d the \u201cletter\u201d began. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, OK?\u201d Trump\u2019s letter to Erdogan, in which he urged the authoritarian Turkish president who has invaded northern Syria \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d, met with widespread disbelief, not least for its strikingly unpresidential tone. \u201cTurkish presidential sources\u201d told the BBC Erdo\u011fan \u201creceived the letter, thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin\u201d. A Russian government spokesman told reporters: \u201cYou don\u2019t often encounter such language in correspondence between heads of state.\u201d The letter was widely mocked and parodied \u2013 the image Clinton tweeted was included in a segment on Trump\u2019s letter by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. But the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, pointed out that like any presidential communication, Trump\u2019s letter to the Turkish president \u201cmay still end up at the National Archives alongside the writings of Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt. The comparison will not be flattering.\u201d The spoof letter tweeted by Clinton continued: \u201cGet your missiles out of Cuba. Everybody will say, \u2018Yay, Khrushchev! You\u2019re the best!\u2019 But if you don\u2019t everybody will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion\u2019. \u201cYou\u2019re really busting my nuts here. Give you a jingle later. Hugs, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.\u201d For most of the weekend before Clinton\u2019s intervention, Trump was uncharacteristically restrained on Twitter. He remained at the White House rather than playing golf but his most impactful missives to his followers concerned his humiliating u-turn on hosting the next G7 summit at his own Florida golf club.

Corrie Dixon has run the blog and online business \u2013 which has a presence on Facebook, YouTube and Patreon \u2013 since 2012, and claims online to have made income from contract shooting, content subscriptions and selling merchandise. Police confirmed on Friday that Dixon was a serving officer, and in a statement said he had \u201ccompleted the relevant submission to undertake outside employment\u201d. Gun control advocates say the situation is \u201cdisturbing\u201d.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s not often you hear 2GB campaigning for alleged law breakers. </strong>Usually the Sydney radio station is calling for harsher penalties for paedophiles, protesters and others who transgress. But for more than six months, Ben Fordham ran an on-air campaign in support of farmers in the north-west of New South Wales who are facing prosecution for land clearing.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 21 October. Top stories A popular Australian gun blog, Ozzie Reviews, which is frequently critical of firearms laws and posts far-right political content, is run by a serving Queensland police officer with formal permission from his superiors, Guardian Australia can reveal. Corrie Dixon has run the blog and online business \u2013 which has a presence on Facebook, YouTube and Patreon \u2013 since 2012, and claims online to have made income from contract shooting, content subscriptions and selling merchandise. Police confirmed on Friday that Dixon was a serving officer, and in a statement said he had \u201ccompleted the relevant submission to undertake outside employment\u201d. Gun control advocates say the situation is \u201cdisturbing\u201d. It\u2019s not often you hear 2GB campaigning for alleged law breakers. Usually the Sydney radio station is calling for harsher penalties for paedophiles, protesters and others who transgress. But for more than six months, Ben Fordham ran an on-air campaign in support of farmers in the north-west of New South Wales who are facing prosecution for land clearing. A Guardian Australia investigation has found that while Fordham painted the farmers as the victims of heartless bureaucrats, there has been little attempt to hear from scientists, ecologists or the NSW environment department about why land clearing needs to be regulated. Boris Johnson\u2019s attempts to pass his Brexit deal are still on a knife-edge, despite senior ministers claiming he has the numbers to get it through, according to Guardian analysis of likely voting intentions. The British prime minister will again seek to hold a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d in the Commons on his deal on Monday, after the EU said it would wait until the deal comes in front of MPs before making decisions on the terms of a further extension. EU ambassadors have agreed that the withdrawal agreement could be sent to the European parliament so MEPs could vote on it by Thursday. Australia Home affairs departmental officials have been left scrambling on how to answer a question about a \u201cstrategic review\u201d outlined in the government\u2019s own budget papers, with senior staff admitting to being unaware one had been ordered, or what became of it. The ABC\u2019s annual report reveals the broadcaster has set aside $23m in compensation for 2,500 casual staff it may have underpaid owing to the practice of putting casuals on \u201cloaded rates\u201d. The government has spent just $2.2m of a $3.5bn fund designed to tackle \u201cimmediate priorities\u201d in regional infrastructure, with construction yet to begin on 98% of projects. Labor is claiming the delay is part of a pattern of infrastructure underspending. The world The world is sleepwalking towards a fresh economic and financial crisis that will have devastating consequences for the democratic market system, according to the former Bank of England governor Mervyn King. Kurdish officials say their fighters have evacuated Ras al-Ayn, giving Turkey and its allies control of one of the border cities that has borne the brunt of fighting since Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria. Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister has told the Catalan president to \u201cstop lying\u201d to the region by promising independence, as the country reels from a week of violent protests. And an 8,000-year-old pearl that archaeologists say is the world\u2019s most ancient is to be displayed in Abu Dhabi, with authorities claiming it as proof that the objects have been traded since neolithic times.

But critics have condemned the program and its treatment of welfare recipients. Can this system ever be fair? On today\u2019s episode of Guardian Australia\u2019s podcast, Full Story, reporter Luke Henriques-Gomes examines the issue through the case of a woman who fought a year-long battle to have her robodebt dropped. Sport Two Sydney teams, two Melbourne teams, and the reigning premiers Perth \u2013 after just two rounds it\u2019s already shaping as an A-League top six that many would have predicted pre-season. But, Richard Parkin writes, one club is missing. Wales has narrowly avoided a France ambush to reach the World Cup semi-finals, after a 20-19 win of which Welsh coach Warren Gatland said \u201cthe better team lost\u201d. Wales will now face South Africa in the semi, after its defeat of Japan 26-3 in a match that trampled all over a dream and left many Japan supporters in tears. Media roundup All the nation\u2019s major newspapers are carrying front pages advocating greater protection for press freedom and whistleblowers and reform to defamation laws and FOI. The Sydney Morning Herald calls for \u201csignificant law reform to stop the suppression of information\u201d, while the Australian points to a \u201csustained attack on the rights of journalists\u201d, and the Daily Telegraph lists \u201csix key legal changes so Australians can find out about the issues that directly affect their lives\u201d.

Last night\u2019s ride aboard the Alfonso Express was my favourite of the season so far \u2013 much as Bruno is a Strictly institution, Alfonso was a welcome breath of fresh air. He\u2019s like a puppy that relentlessly licks your face when you\u2019re having a bad day \u2013 even though it\u2019s kind of annoying, you can\u2019t help but feel better. </p> <p>Can\u2019t see how David and Nadiya aren\u2019t going home this evening \u2013 I\u2019d be amazed if they\u2019re not in the bottom two, and only Mike and Katya taking both bits of Samba out of their routine could save them. Given the choice, I think I\u2019d rather have Mike in the Halloween Special than David, although both are good sports. </p> <p>Kick off is at 7.15pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! In the meantime: Countryfile Tree Special!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dab63748f08c78d1cb4ecb3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T19:27:37.778Z\">8.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Thanks to the BTL glitterati for joining in tonight, will see you tomorrow at 7.15pm for the Results Show \u2013 surely it\u2019s David and Nadiya\u2019s time to say goodbye? </p> <p>If you happen to have BBC1 on just before 9am tomorrow, you might spot me chatting about Strictly on BBC Breakfast \u2013 I haven\u2019t got time to get to Salford, so instead I\u2019ll be live from BBC Bristol. It\u2019s as close as I\u2019ll ever get to my childhood dream of anchoring a Children In Need outside broadcast. </p> <p>In the meantime I\u2019m off to read your comments, so don\u2019t forget to share your highs and lows below (or on Twitter @heidistephens), and enjoy the rest of your Saturday!

It\u2019s also Guest Judge Week \u2013 Bruno is off Dancing With Some Stars in the US, and once again they\u2019ve replaced him with Alfonso Ribeiro. If you\u2019re not familiar with Alfonso\u2019s work, he qualifies for the Strictly judging panel because he won DWTS in 2014, and also does a funny dance on demand. </p> <p>After last week\u2019s shock eviction, my Heidi\u2019s Hunches in in tatters \u2013 I had Dev driving for December and now nothing makes sense.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s it for another week on the Strictly sofa \u2013 next week it\u2019s HALLOWEEN, so wear your spookiest outfit and prepare for all manner of pumpkin spiced nonsense. Thank you all for joining in and being amazing as always, hope you have a fab week. See you next Saturday! Hx David and Nadiya say heartfelt things about each other, then take to the floor to \u2018Don\u2019t You Forget About Me\u2019 by Simple Minds. What a song. So how will the judges vote? Craig saves Mike and Katya, and Motsi does likewise. Obviously Alfonso saves Mike and Katya too, would be rude not to. Which means it\u2019s the end of the road for DAVID AND NADIYA \u2013 the right decision at the end of a top Strictly weekend. Time to revisit Mike and Katya\u2019s hip-thrusting Samba-lite \u2013 lack of content aside, it\u2019s a some fairly inspired choreography from Katya. I don\u2019t think the Jump On It lasso is ever going to beat Ed Balls riding the Gangnam Style pony, but still not one we\u2019re going to forget in a hurry. I know this is objectively terrible, but it\u2019s making me laugh and god knows we all need a bit of that right now. Dance off time! David\u2019s Jive was full of mistakes last night, can he get his feet in order this time round? The simple answer is no, not really \u2013 the first half is definitely better than last night but then it all goes a bit awry. By the end David looks like he\u2019s dancing to something else entirely. The taxi is clearly running. Next week: the HALLOWEEN SPECIAL! I never really look forward to it, but it\u2019s usually kind of amazing. I plan to fully embrace it this year. Oh good lord, I\u2019ve just realised we\u2019re going to have to watch that Jive AND that Samba again. The dance off is a cruel mistress. So who is joining Mike and Katya in tonight\u2019s dance off? Catherine and Johannes are safe, along with Emma and Anton and Chris and Karen Which means DAVID AND NADIYA are in the bottom two. Sanity reigns, and all is as it should be. As for why she\u2019s wearing a towelling dressing gown, I have no idea. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of singer-songwriter Mabel. She\u2019s singing her huge hit \u2018Don\u2019t Call Me Up\u2019 from earlier this year. Right now she\u2019s got a track with Tiesto called \u2018God is a Dancer\u2019 in the charts that\u2019s an absolute banger \u2013 Mabel\u2019s music is very much my cup of tea, and great to see more contemporary artists on Strictly. Also, pop fact fans \u2013 as lots of people have mentioned in the comments, Mabel is the daughter of 80s chart queen Neneh Cherry. I was a huge fan of her too, so I find this rather pleasing. More couples safely through to next week: Alex and Neil, Karim and Amy, Michelle and Giovanni and Kelvin and Oti. They\u2019re dragging this out, but it\u2019s pretty clear that David and Nadiya are in trouble. So who is safely through to the HALLOWEEN SPECIAL next week? Will and Janette are safe, along with Saffron and AJ and Emma and Aljaz. First couple in the bottom two: MIKE AND KATYA. Last night on Strictly: what a difference a week makes. Great dancing, fabulous costumes, dance-appropriate music and scoring that largely made sense (Alfonso bonuses aside). Highlights included an extraordinary contemporary routine from Will and Janette, a high-speed Salsa from Karim and Amy, a dreamy Viennese from Emma and Aljaz and a hip-thrusting Samba (in name only) from Mike and Katya. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: two oven-ready roasting bags. I\u2019ll set the timer. And we\u2019re off! This week\u2019s opening pro dance has a red carpet theme to \u2018Fame\u2019 by David Bowie. Loving Nadiya\u2019s angel wings and skimpy undergarments, Oti looks incredible in that catsuit, and I could watch Johannes vogue in heels all day. SLAY. Well that was incredible. God I love this show. Tonight\u2019s Countryfile Casual Weatherperson is the dapper Nick Miller in nicely fitted lumberjack shirt and denim. \u2018Weather\u2019s going to be quiet \u2013 quieter than this shirt anyway\u2019, says Nick; does this mean Nick is an unwilling CCW, having had his plaid arm twisted by wardrobe? This look is a solid CCW 8/10 \u2013 if he wanted to match week 2\u2019s Ben Rich, he needed to undo another button. On Countryfile, Matt Baker is lathing a pole whilst wearing a gilet *fans self*. Meanwhile all the animals appear to be pregnant. I\u2019m not saying these two things are related, but we probably shouldn\u2019t discount it. Evening all, and welcome back to this week\u2019s Strictly Results Show! Last night\u2019s ride aboard the Alfonso Express was my favourite of the season so far \u2013 much as Bruno is a Strictly institution, Alfonso was a welcome breath of fresh air. He\u2019s like a puppy that relentlessly licks your face when you\u2019re having a bad day \u2013 even though it\u2019s kind of annoying, you can\u2019t help but feel better. Can\u2019t see how David and Nadiya aren\u2019t going home this evening \u2013 I\u2019d be amazed if they\u2019re not in the bottom two, and only Mike and Katya taking both bits of Samba out of their routine could save them. Given the choice, I think I\u2019d rather have Mike in the Halloween Special than David, although both are good sports. Kick off is at 7.15pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! In the meantime: Countryfile Tree Special! Thanks to the BTL glitterati for joining in tonight, will see you tomorrow at 7.15pm for the Results Show \u2013 surely it\u2019s David and Nadiya\u2019s time to say goodbye? If you happen to have BBC1 on just before 9am tomorrow, you might spot me chatting about Strictly on BBC Breakfast \u2013 I haven\u2019t got time to get to Salford, so instead I\u2019ll be live from BBC Bristol. It\u2019s as close as I\u2019ll ever get to my childhood dream of anchoring a Children In Need outside broadcast. In the meantime I\u2019m off to read your comments, so don\u2019t forget to share your highs and lows below (or on Twitter @heidistephens), and enjoy the rest of your Saturday! Until tomorrow, Hx And that\u2019s it - the dancing is done, and the voting is open! I quite like it when Bruno is on holiday; Alfonso is still unhinged, but in a somehow more charming way. My faves of this evening were Karim and Amy, Will and Janette and Emma and Aljaz. Scores: 9,10,9,10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Saffron and AJ, and we finish on an Alfonso ten! DRINK. Also SO much screaming. DRINK. Motsi thought Saffron did really well, and she had great technique. Shirley loved the heel turns, and she was very impressed with Saffron\u2019s timing. Alfonso thought it was awesome, with spectacular rise and fall. Craig thought technically it was brilliant, and \u2018you\u2019ve really surprised me tonight\u2019. The SHADE of it. Some good cane work to start, and lovely to see a classic Foxtrot from Saffron and AJ. Feels like her heel leads are a bit overcooked, but a nice top line from Saffron and bags of style. The final cane section is a bit of a shambles, but she styles it out nicely. And finally tonight it\u2019s SAFFRON AND AJ! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to the theme From New York, New York by Frank Sinatra. Since they\u2019ve got the glory slot, I think it\u2019s reasonable to start spreading the news that they\u2019re probably not leaving today. No relatives for Saffron today, she\u2019d used them all up by Week 4. Maybe time to start wheeling out the two million YouTube followers in small groups? Scores: 5,6,7,7 \u2013 a total of 25 for Chris and Karen. Craig wanted Chris to use more of the floor, but he loves watching him. Motsi thought it was another improvement and Chris needs to keep pushing. Shirley thought it was a bit flat-footed in places, but definitely an improvement. Alfonso loved the fun and thought Chris made everyone smile. This is quite fast and furious from Chris, but he is (for the most part) keeping up with Karen. This is very much Chris\u2019s kind of dance, and he\u2019s come quite a long way since week one. In a high scoring week he\u2019s definitely in danger, but he\u2019s a public favourite and has bags of charisma. Enjoyed that. Goodness, how do you follow that? Next up it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to \u2018Let\u2019s Go Crazy\u2019 by Prince. I LOVE this song, and really want them to include the spoken intro. Something along the lines of \u201cdearly beloved, we have gathered here today to get through a slightly bedraggled Quickstep\u201d. Scores, 7,8,8,9 \u2013 a total of 32 for Will and Janette. Alfonso had chills and it was incredibly inspiring, and Craig loved the emotional storytelling, although it would have helped Will tell the story if he\u2019d had more movement in his torso. Motsi is in bits and can\u2019t speak. Shirley thought it was a beautiful number and so well executed. This is the first time in ten years that a dance on Strictly has made me cry. Well this is rather special \u2013 Will has incredible inner strength and it shines through in this routine. I love the relationship between him and Janette, she really has brought out the dancer and storyteller in him. Beautiful. Only three left! It\u2019s time for WILL AND JANETTE! This week they\u2019re dancing their Couple\u2019s Choice \u2013 a Contemporary routine to \u20187 Years\u2019 by Lukas Graham. I suspect this might be all rather beautiful. Lovely to hear Will\u2019s story, what an incredible inspiration he is. Scores: 3,6,5,7 \u2013 a total of 21 for Mike and Katya. LOL. Shirley thought it was an amazing crowd pleaser, but let\u2019s not talk about the Samba. Alfonso comes out from behind the desk to make this dance all about him, whilst Craig recoiled in horror from beginning to end \u2013 it was like watching a three-year-old. Motsi was left confused \u2013 Mike did everything her teacher told her not to, but it had great entertainment and energy. Katya has gone full muppet (DRINK) and Mike looks deeply uncomfortable with the whole business, frankly. It\u2019s all a bit Norman Wisdom, but you can\u2019t fault Mike for being a good sport. The actual Samba bits really aren\u2019t bad, I\u2019d just like there to be more of them. I love how the band keeps shouting \u2018SAMBA, jump on it\u2019, just to remind us what this dance is. I weirdly enjoyed that, can\u2019t really explain why. Next up it\u2019s MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018Apache (Jump On It)\u2019 by The Sugarhill Gang. It\u2019s not an obvious song for a Samba, and there\u2019s a strong argument that this kind of thing should probably be illegal. I can only assume it\u2019s been chosen because there is a very famous scene featuring this song from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air that may prompt a nostalgic Alfonso ten. BRACE BRACE. Scores: 9,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Emma and Aljaz. WELL. Motsi thought it was beautiful in every way, and Shirley agrees \u2013 it was a miraculous recovery and she\u2019s never seen such an improvement in one week. Alfonso hopes Emma feels amazing after that performance, the push last week has made her brilliant. Craig thought Aljaz has worked wonders, and that dance proves why Emma is still in the competition. Time to update Heidi\u2019s Hunches, these two aren\u2019t going anywhere. Love the one-shouldered bridal wear (DRINK). \u201cA few stolen moments is all that we share/you\u2019ve got your family and they need you there.\u201d Essentially the story of this dance is Aljaz being sidelined by Emma in favour of some giraffes and a bunch of bonkers in-laws in the attic. OK not really. As expected, this is rather lovely \u2013 Aljaz is king of the Viennese, and Emma looks very happy in his arms (who wouldn\u2019t?). Lovely flow, albeit Emma\u2019s feet are obscured by fog and a few dead swans. Loved that. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s EMMA AND ALJA\u017d! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Saving All My Love for You\u2019 by Whitney Houston. This is song is 100% dreamy, I hope both the vocals and the dancing do it justice. Scores: 8,8,8,9 \u2013 a total of 33 for Alex and Neil. Craig thought it was a huge improvement since last week, it was fantastic. Motsi had been waiting five weeks to see this side of Alex and Shirley agrees \u2013 by far Alex\u2019s best dance. Alfonso thought it was the perfect song for Alex and she came out of her shell to be a wonderful butterfly. Please Alfonso, tell me more about these shelled butterflies. Right come on Alex, get your booty on the floor and make our day. Love the matching outfits, and this is the most fun we\u2019ve seen Alex have. Her core strength comes into its own with this kind of dance \u2013 a few timing issues and a little untidy in places,but love the character. More of this please. It\u2019s time for ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Pump Up the Jam\u2019 by Swingrowers, which I\u2019m assuming is a jazz/swing version of the Technotronic belter from 1989. Oh good. Incidentally, Pump Up The Jam would be an excellent anthem for boosting the UK\u2019s preserves trade post-Brexit, along with Lady Marmalade and Hey Pickle you\u2019re so fine (note to self: needs more work). We\u2019re half way through! Please don\u2019t leave me. Scores: 5,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 26 for Emma and Anton. Alfonso thought Emma gave it her all, but he wanted more physical passion and energy. Craig thought it lacked fire and Emma\u2019s free arm was all over the place, she looked like a bag of potatoes. Motsi thought it was a wow at the beginning and she loved the character. Shirley agrees that it lacked passion and fight between the two of them and the lack of time showed. Emma looks a bit Maleficent, and I\u2019m loving the drama of her skirt work. Her frame is a bit pitched forward and this lacks finish in parts, but a really very decent effort considering she missed the first two days of rehearsal. Ooh, that finish was a bit of a mess, limbs everywhere. Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Nothing Breaks Like A Heart\u2019 by Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus. I loved their Viennese last week, much prefer Anton with a decent partner rather than being subjected to the Comedy Anton Show every week. That said, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen Anton do a Paso that isn\u2019t camper than a chiffon tent, and I\u2019m not sure Miley is going to help. Scores: 7,7,7,8 \u2013 a total of 29 for Michelle and Giovanni. Shirley loved the choreography, but it lacked sensuality and quality in places. Alfonso loved the connection in the story, and thought it was very hot. Craig didn\u2019t think it oozed, and it needed more continuous movement, but the storytelling was exquisite. Motsi loved Michelle\u2019s aura and the dance gave her really feeling and emotion. Michelle has a much better dress this week, in fact it appears to be several dressed in one. This Rumba has some sensitive touches and some lovely lines from Michelle, but also feels a bit tentative in places and lacking the connection we need from a Rumba. Left me a bit cold, sadly. Who\u2019s next? Excellent, it\u2019s MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Rumba to \u2018Too Good at Goodbyes\u2019 by Sam Smith. Kelvin and Oti set a very high Rumba bar last week, but of all the remaining couples I have the highest hopes for these two giving them a run for their Rumba money. Scores: 8,10,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Karim and Amy. Motsi got more than a party feeling \u2013 Karim is taking this competition to a whole different level. Shirley thought Karim has set the bar even higher, he\u2019s a delight to watch in every way. Alfonso thought Karim brought the dogs in, fed them, then let them back out. Craig thought Karim was taking too big steps and it needs more control, but he loved it. OK so I take it back, this is great. Karim is having a BALL, and giving it full Salsa hip action and shimmy. I\u2019m not fussed about the handstands and street dance sections, but that was great fun and Karim is outstanding. LOVED. Also full fringing from Amy. DRINK. Next up it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Who Let the Dogs Out\u2019 by Baha Men, presumably because Amy wanted to do a calypso-style Salsa and literally no other song was available. I\u2019m pretty sure Karim was in nappies when this came out, lord knows why they\u2019ve let it out of the millennium novelty dustbin. Oh, apparently this dance is dedicated to Hacker T. Dog. Forget nans and parents, Karim\u2019s got a puppet. Scores: 6,7,7,8 -a total of 28 for Catherine and Johannes. Craig didn\u2019t feel Catherine and Johannes were dancing as one unit, and the footwork was sloppy. But good drive and great staccato. Motsi wanted it to be sharper, but is enjoying the variety in Catherine\u2019s dancing. Shirley also had issues with the footwork, but also plenty that is improving. Alfonso loved the character and the hotness, and Catherine\u2019s top line is gorgeous. Catherine has gone full peacock, which is actually quite a LARGE bird if we\u2019re being picky. She descends on a swing, drags Johannes out of his cage and proceeds to deliver a pretty feisty Tango. Could do with more attack and a tidier footwork, but a great music choice and a nice top line. Enjoyed that. It\u2019s time for CATHERINE AND JOHANNES! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Little Bird\u2019 by Annie Lennox. This is such a great song, one of my faves from Annie Lennox. Haven\u2019t seen a Tango I\u2019ve really loved yet this season, so very much hoping Catherine and Johannes are going to smash this. Scores: 3,4,4,5 \u2013 a total of 16 for David and Nadiya. Alfonso thinks the Jive is hard for a tall man (BONUS DRINK) and there were some issues. He asks David to scream (DRINK) so he can let it go and have some fun. Craig thought no amount of screaming is going to fix that, it needed more energy and better timing. Motsi liked the top half of David\u2019s body, but there were a LOT of mistakes down below. Shirley thought it had good basic content, and David carried on despite the mistakes and also he is TALL. I find David rather charming \u2013 he tries so hard but always looks like he\u2019s in a state of mild panic. Much of this is Nadiya using him as a human pole so we don\u2019t have to look at his turned in toes and terrible timing. If I was Dev on my sofa right now, I\u2019d be LIVID. Next up it\u2019s DAVID AND NADIYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Such A by Night\u2019 by Michael Buble. I\u2019m still not convinced that Buble is for life rather than just Christmas, but people will insist on playing his songs outside the official Buble season. This is the slot of death \u2013 the Strictly powers-that-be have clearly decided that David\u2019s time is up. Time for the Terms &amp; Conditions, this week courtesy of comedian Joe Lycett. I don\u2019t really see the point of this segment, but I\u2019m prepared to tolerate it if it means they never bring back the comedy VT. It\u2019s been blessedly absent this year (Halloween pending) in favour of the training footage we all begged for, so this two minutes of WTF feels like a small price to pay. Scores: 8,8,8,9 - a total of 33 for Kelvin and Oti. Shirley thought Kelvin brought sunshine to the studio, but it needed more fluidity in the leg action. Alfonso thought it was awesome and Kelvin was driving from the seat of his pants. Craig thought it was a bit stiff in the walks but amazing rhythm and isolations. Motsi couldn\u2019t take her eyes of Kelvin\u2019s feet (SURE), and he gave her flirty energy. Kelvin is such a great dancer, and he\u2019s making this Cha Cha look easy. Great hip action, lovely Cha Cha basics and bags of fun from start to finish. A couple of small timing issues at the end, but enjoyed that a LOT. First up tonight it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Cha Cha Cha to \u2018Get Stupid\u2019 by Aston Merrygold, who has popped in for training. Hopefully Kelvin\u2019s liquid hips will dull the 2017 pain. Just a small reminder that last week was scoring mayhem and musical madness that ultimately resulted in the excellent Dev Griffin going home. I\u2019m still cross about it, and would like to take this moment to dedicate my crossness to my nan, who sadly died 24 years ago. Out come the stars! Nadiya in a fringy merkin, DRINK! Oh good lord, Katya has eaten a fraggle, DRINK DRINK DRINK. And a couple of asymmetric shoulders, I\u2019m so sorry. Out come the judges! Motsi\u2019s gone full pearly queen. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess upholstered in blue velvet flares with some kind of peplum arrangement (awful), Claudia in a black and white spotty frock (lovely for a picnic). And we\u2019re off! We\u2019ve reached the point in the series where it feels like we\u2019ve been doing this for MONTHS and yet somehow only three couples have left. How is that possible? \u201cWatch out Strictly 2019, Alfonso\u2019s back!\u201d I mean, he can\u2019t be any more unhinged than Bruno. @scarletpanda down below just asked what makes fringing superfluous. Top half OR bottom half is fine, if it\u2019s both that\u2019s just excessive. I don\u2019t make the rules (I do). This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a slug of that flavoured gin someone gave you last Christmas for any occurrence of the following (you\u2019ll get a load more in a couple of months, best get rid): An Alfonso Ten Screaming Superfluous fringing One-shouldered frocks Early mentions of Halloween Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It\u2019s Week Five, which means the last week of (relative) normality before the ninth circle of hell is cracked open for Halloween. It\u2019s also Guest Judge Week \u2013 Bruno is off Dancing With Some Stars in the US, and once again they\u2019ve replaced him with Alfonso Ribeiro. If you\u2019re not familiar with Alfonso\u2019s work, he qualifies for the Strictly judging panel because he won DWTS in 2014, and also does a funny dance on demand. After last week\u2019s shock eviction, my Heidi\u2019s Hunches in in tatters \u2013 I had Dev driving for December and now nothing makes sense. But let\u2019s plod on regardless, just in case scoring logic is restored at any point \u2013 I\u2019ve promoted Catherine and Johannes to the top group as this year\u2019s most likely candidates for a Strictly Journey, and moved Chris and Mike out of the danger zone \u2013 they seems to be shaping up as public faves. Group 1: driving for December \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy, Catherine and Johannes Group 2: battling for Blackpool \u2013 Emma B and Anton, Will and Janette, Saffron and AJ, Alex and Neil, Chris and Karen, Mike and Katya Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 David and Nadiya, Emma W and Aljaz I\u2019ll be jiving away up here from 6.40pm, so please join me then \u2013 tonight\u2019s show is 1 hour 49 minutes so feel free to sprinkle appropriate levels of joy in the comment box while you\u2019re down there. See you in a bit!",

Pereira\u2019s role was United in microcosm: quick across the pitch, and muscular in the challenge. A moment midway through the opening half summed the ploy up.</p> \n<p>Rashford engaged Van Dijk in a race down United\u2019s right. As the two reached the ball, the slighter Rashford bounced the Uefa player of the year to the turf, turned, and zipped the ball infield. Liverpool scrambled and recovered but the narrative was set.</p> \n<p>The script was possible because of many United players performing to their potential for the first time in a long time. Fred\u2019s inclusion in the XI is these days seen as a near shock because of his poor displays in his two years at the club. There is a view at Old Trafford that Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s failure here derived from him lacking the nerve required to wear United colours.</p> \n<p>Fred, too, could be accused of the same and this third consecutive start was only because of Paul Pogba\u2019s injury. This display, though, countered the notion. Whether in the tackle, passing, or taking up position, the Brazilian impressed.</p> \n<p>As did Rashford. The finish from James\u2019s pinpoint cross was the No 10 at his best, for a first United goal since 14 September.</p> \n<p>Klopp was an unhappy figure throughout, though. The second half had him continuing to berate Jonathan Moss, the fourth official, for perceived injustices. Yet the truth was that beyond the VAR controversy his side were being outplayed. Matip received a rollicking from the manager for poor awareness, followed up moments later by hooking a ball, Sunday League-style, into the heavens.</p> \n<p>The sight of Klopp turning away from the game in disappointment had become a <em>leitmotif</em> of the afternoon. Andy Robertson invoked his ire by booting a pass straight out for a United throw. As Liverpool stared at a first league loss in more than 10 months, Klopp brought on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for Origi and shifted his side to a quasi 4-2-4 that had Jordan Henderson on the right.</p> \n<p>To have Liverpool\u2019s one-paced captain as an auxiliary winger summed up the job United were doing on them. By the close Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men could be disappointed but proud. What fascinates now are the implications of this result in the coming weeks.</p>",

Rashford engaged Van Dijk in a race down United\u2019s right. As the two reached the ball, the slighter Rashford bounced the Uefa player of the year to the turf, turned, and zipped the ball infield. Liverpool scrambled and recovered but the narrative was set. The script was possible because of many United players performing to their potential for the first time in a long time. Fred\u2019s inclusion in the XI is these days seen as a near shock because of his poor displays in his two years at the club. There is a view at Old Trafford that Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s failure here derived from him lacking the nerve required to wear United colours. Fred, too, could be accused of the same and this third consecutive start was only because of Paul Pogba\u2019s injury. This display, though, countered the notion. Whether in the tackle, passing, or taking up position, the Brazilian impressed. As did Rashford. The finish from James\u2019s pinpoint cross was the No 10 at his best, for a first United goal since 14 September. Klopp was an unhappy figure throughout, though. The second half had him continuing to berate Jonathan Moss, the fourth official, for perceived injustices. Yet the truth was that beyond the VAR controversy his side were being outplayed. Matip received a rollicking from the manager for poor awareness, followed up moments later by hooking a ball, Sunday League-style, into the heavens. The sight of Klopp turning away from the game in disappointment had become a leitmotif of the afternoon. Andy Robertson invoked his ire by booting a pass straight out for a United throw. As Liverpool stared at a first league loss in more than 10 months, Klopp brought on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for Origi and shifted his side to a quasi 4-2-4 that had Jordan Henderson on the right. To have Liverpool\u2019s one-paced captain as an auxiliary winger summed up the job United were doing on them. By the close Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men could be disappointed but proud. What fascinates now are the implications of this result in the coming weeks.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s easy to see why the work of Austrian painter Egon Schiele (1890-1918) is tempting choreographic catnip. The expressionist aesthetics of Schiele\u2019s nudes \u2013 emotionally charged and attenuated lines, tense dynamics and oddly contorted poses \u2013 seem like a natural fit for contemporary dance. Despite this felicitous figural match, Shobana Jeyasingh\u2019s Staging Schiele doesn\u2019t always make for riveting dance.</p> <p>Part of the lasting power of Schiele\u2019s work lies in the unflinching depiction of his models\u2019 (or his own) genitals \u2013 thrust forward, distorted, sometimes hermaphroditic \u2013 accompanied by a direct gaze at the viewer. Here, the four dancers strip off gauzy outer garments to reveal flesh-coloured underwear.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s easy to see why the work of Austrian painter Egon Schiele (1890-1918) is tempting choreographic catnip. The expressionist aesthetics of Schiele\u2019s nudes \u2013 emotionally charged and attenuated lines, tense dynamics and oddly contorted poses \u2013 seem like a natural fit for contemporary dance. Despite this felicitous figural match, Shobana Jeyasingh\u2019s Staging Schiele doesn\u2019t always make for riveting dance. Part of the lasting power of Schiele\u2019s work lies in the unflinching depiction of his models\u2019 (or his own) genitals \u2013 thrust forward, distorted, sometimes hermaphroditic \u2013 accompanied by a direct gaze at the viewer. Here, the four dancers strip off gauzy outer garments to reveal flesh-coloured underwear. Though their surly spread-eagling pays homage to Schiele\u2019s bodies, a lot of beige gusset ends up on display. It\u2019s an inadvertent reminder that Schiele\u2019s nether regions are anything but beige. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a slick and skilful production. An upstage structure of slanted metal bars and spare strip lights alludes to Schiele\u2019s brief stint in prison (for obscenity) while evoking a more general sense of spatial dislocation, with washes of pale green and red light suggesting the bruised hues of Schiele\u2019s watercolours. Fragmented video projections of the artist\u2019s face are matched by a collage of sounds and music: excerpts from poems by Rilke and Schiele and the intense scribbling of a pencil are punctuated by orgasmic yelps and unsettling piano. Dancing with a small mirror, Dane Hurst is a nimble and compelling presence in the opening section.

We\u2019ll have a full story on that launching soon, but in the meantime, here are a few key points from Rowena Mason:</p> \n  <p>\u2022 Around eight Labour MPs are likely to back the deal. On Sunday, Lucy Powell suggested that she could be one of that group, telling Sky News: \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have voted for it if we had had a straight up and down vote on it over the weekend but I do think now that we\u2019ve got to move forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u2022 No 10 claims that several more Labour MPs could follow.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 Around 20 former Tories who lost the whip or left the party voluntarily are expected to support the prime minister.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 The support of Lady Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, appears to be in doubt. During the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday she demanded a \u201cguarantee that there is nothing in this deal.. which undermines or weakens the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On these numbers, it would take just two MPs changing their minds to change the result.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/vote_for_a_deal_waffle/giv-3902yFfsgwr9IFAM/\" data-alt=\"Estimated votes for and against Boris Johnson's deal.\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/vote_for_a_deal_waffle/giv-3902yFfsgwr9IFAM/\">Estimated votes for and against Boris Johnson's deal.</a> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T18:07:24.105Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dac9e198f08142786c4f5f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T17:52:08.501Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>All is not well at the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Rowena Mason reports: clashes between PR guru Roland Rudd and Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-mandelson\">Peter Mandelson</a> have sent the organisation into crisis just as the prospect of testing MPs\u2019 support for a second referendum becomes a reality.</p> \n  <p>Alastair Campbell\u2019s involved, too, as a leak to the Mail on Sunday showed:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The emails suggested Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, another former New Labour communications adviser, had been attempting to work together against Rudd earlier this year.

This is likely to include trying to hold a second EU referendum, securing a future customs union or inserting safeguards on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. </p> \n  <p>Losing another meaningful vote on the deal could lead to the PM facing an opposition motion of no confidence, paving the way for a general election and further clouding the precise future of the Brexit process.</p> \n  <p><strong>Has Johnson sent a letter to Brussels seeking a Brexit delay? </strong></p> \n  <p>Under the terms of the so-called Benn act, which was passed against the PM\u2019s wishes, Johnson was compelled to write to the EU asking for a three-month Brexit extension if he had not secured a deal by 11pm UK time on 19 October. He told the Commons on Saturday: \u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u201d </p> \n  <p>But he did eventually send two letters to the European council president, <strong>Donald Tusk</strong>. There was an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn act, followed by a letter explaining why the government did not actually want an extension. There was also an explanatory letter from <strong>Sir Tim Barrow</strong>, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, which was sent to <strong>Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen</strong>, the secretary general of the Council of the European Union.</p> \n  <p><strong>Will the EU agree to an extension?</strong></p> \n  <p>Despite the European commission president, <strong>Jean-Claude Juncker</strong>, raising doubts over the likelihood of another Brexit delay, that decision needs to be taken by all 27 remaining EU states. The EU could set a different length to an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn act. </p> \n  <p>The EU could decide not to formally respond to the PM\u2019s letter until it sees if Johnson can get the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament this week. If the PM gets the cill through, there could be a special gathering of EU leaders on 28 October.</p> \n  <p>If the deal needs more time at that stage to get through parliament, leaders could agree to a short \u201ctechnical\u201d extension.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T14:18:52.089Z\">at 3.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dac677c8f0859498cfb1c60\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T14:01:56.787Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a helpful Q&amp;A from the Press Association on the state of play:</p> \n  <p><strong>Why did a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal not go ahead on Saturday? </strong></p> \n  <p>MPs voted by a majority of 16 to back an amendment put forward by the former cabinet minister <strong>Oliver Letwin</strong> to withhold approval of the latest deal agreed between Johnson and Brussels \u201cunless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d. Letwin, who lost the Tory whip for voting against the government on Brexit previously, said the amendment was \u201cinsurance\u201d against the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by mistake on the scheduled deadline of 31 October. After he lost the vote, the prime minister decided not to have the so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his deal. </p> \n  <p><strong>When will Johnson next try to get his Brexit deal through parliament? </strong></p> \n  <p>The government is set to bring the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed for Brexit \u2013 to the Commons this coming week. However, time is running out to beat the 31 October deadline because the European parliament would also need to ratify it. Ministers could try to hold additional sittings to get the legislation through.</p> \n  <p>The Commons leader, <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>,<strong> </strong>said the government wanted to hold another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s deal on Monday and would make an emergency business statement to achieve this. The Commons Speaker, <strong>John Bercow</strong>, said he would consider whether to allow the government\u2019s plans.</p> \n  <p><strong>Does Johnson have the numbers to achieve a Commons majority for his Brexit deal?</strong></p> \n  <p>In the current hung parliament, much will hinge on the PM securing support from pro-Brexit Tories who voted down <strong>Theresa May\u2019s </strong>deal on three occasions, plus the 21 former Conservatives who lost the whip over the issue of a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <p>The former Tory cabinet minister <strong>Amber Rudd</strong> has indicated she will support Johnson\u2019s deal and thinks there is a \u201ccoalition for getting the prime minister\u2019s deal through\u201d.

The Observer carried a picture of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/peoples-vote--march-a-very-british-rebellion-in-the-rain\">People\u2019s Vote march</a> alongside news of the prime minister\u2019s \u201chumiliating defeat\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Our crack visuals unit has worked up this graphic showing estimated votes for and against Johnson\u2019s deal, based on a Guardian analysis of MPs\u2019 likely intentions - and while ministers insist they have the numbers, it\u2019s clear that it remains agonisingly close. We\u2019ll have a full story on that launching soon, but in the meantime, here are a few key points from Rowena Mason: \u2022 Around eight Labour MPs are likely to back the deal. On Sunday, Lucy Powell suggested that she could be one of that group, telling Sky News: \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have voted for it if we had had a straight up and down vote on it over the weekend but I do think now that we\u2019ve got to move forward.\u201d \u2022 No 10 claims that several more Labour MPs could follow. \u2022 Around 20 former Tories who lost the whip or left the party voluntarily are expected to support the prime minister. \u2022 The support of Lady Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, appears to be in doubt. During the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday she demanded a \u201cguarantee that there is nothing in this deal.. which undermines or weakens the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.\u201d On these numbers, it would take just two MPs changing their minds to change the result. All is not well at the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Rowena Mason reports: clashes between PR guru Roland Rudd and Labour peer Peter Mandelson have sent the organisation into crisis just as the prospect of testing MPs\u2019 support for a second referendum becomes a reality. Alastair Campbell\u2019s involved, too, as a leak to the Mail on Sunday showed: The emails suggested Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, another former New Labour communications adviser, had been attempting to work together against Rudd earlier this year. In one email, Campbell said: \u201cI do not see how this gets done without a public battle and it should happen soon and be fast and brutal.\u201d You can read the story here: Of the six Labour MPs who voted against the Letwin amendment on Saturday, only Caroline Flint is not standing down. Helen Pidd went to her firmly leave-supporting constituency, Don Valley, to find out what her constituents think, and found that they remain firmly in her corner. 75-year-old Bob Davis, for example, said: I think she\u2019s wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it\u2019s as simple as that... It would be an insult to me to run a second referendum. I believe strongly in democracy.\u201d You can read the whole piece here: - The government is to seek a meaningful vote in the Commons on its Brexit deal on Monday. - Michael Gove has disclosed the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer contingency plan to handle a no-deal Brexit is being triggered. - Gove says the risk of the UK leaving the EU without a deal has grown as a result of yesterday\u2019s vote but believes Brexit will happen on 31 October. - Labour will back an amendment next week calling for a referendum on Johnson\u2019s deal, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said. - John McDonnell said Johnson behaved \u201ca bit like a spoilt brat\u201d after the prime minister sent an unsigned letter to the EU asking for a delay, and then a second arguing against it. A key player in Britain\u2019s first involvement in the European Union has called for a second Brexit referendum after attending his first protest at the age of 91. Uwe Kitzinger worked as an adviser to Winston Churchill\u2019s son-in-law Christopher Soames from 1973 to 1975, when Lord Soames became the first British vice-president of the European commission. Kitzinger attended the People\u2019s Vote march in London on Saturday and believes the public are now better informed to make a choice. \u201cI do not see how the question of sovereignty over the issue of Europe can be settled without the people of this country having a say, now that they are much better informed, and now that there is actually a proposal,\u201d he told PA. \u201cWe now see the beginnings of a transition to a destination, but it\u2019s very clear that the destination is meant to be one of national tribalism, and that is the beginning of the kind of international tensions which can so easily lead to war. \u201cIt is the negation of all I stood for and all I worked for in my career, but that isn\u2019t the important thing. \u201cThe important thing is what happens to my grandchildren, and their children.\u201d Boris Johnson faces another rollercoaster week in the Commons after insisting the UK will still leave the EU in 11 days\u2019 time. Despite being forced by parliament to request a Brexit delay from Brussels, ministers talked up their chances of rushing Brexit legislation through the Commons. A potential new government showdown with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, looms on Monday when he will rule on whether the prime minister can hold a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his Brexit deal. Johnson abandoned plans for such a move on a special Saturday sitting of the Commons after suffering an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the former minister Sir Oliver Letwin. Labour is planning to try to hijack the prime minister\u2019s Brexit legislation when he presents it to MPs by tabling amendments demanding a new referendum and customs union with the EU. The Shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, indicated Labour could even support the withdrawal agreement bill if a new national poll on it is backed by MPs. Jeremy Corbyn speaking in Liverpool on Saturday night. Alliance MLAs will not go to the Stormont recall sitting on Monday Jo Swinson has described breaking up the United Kingdom, if Scotland was to vote for independence, as \u201cmuch more difficult than what we\u2019re experiencing with Brexit\u201d. The Liberal Democrat leader said it was a lesson she had learned throughout the process of Britain\u2019s attempt to leave the EU since June 2016. Speaking on radio programme Scotland\u2019s Talk In, the East Dunbartonshire MP said she was the only party leader campaigning to keep Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU. Last week at the SNP\u2019s conference in Aberdeen, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said a second independence referendum north of the border \u201cmust happen next year\u201d. But Swinson said: \u201cI want the UK to stay in the European Union, that\u2019s what I\u2019m working for and I believe that\u2019s still possible. I believe we can still do that and I\u2019m not giving up on that cause because I think we\u2019re better off having Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU.\u201d Here is the link to the Commons order paper outlining Monday\u2019s agenda: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201920/cmagenda/LargeP_OP191021.pdf The order paper for Monday confirms the government will seek a meaningful vote on its Brexit deal again, as announced by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, on Saturday. However, the Speaker of the Commons may disallow this because the government already had one attempt at getting the motion through on Saturday, when it was amended by parliament to prevent it from being a meaningful vote. This meant that the Benn act was triggered and Boris Johnson had to write to the EU requesting an extension to article 50. How would any future \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on the PM\u2019s Brexit deal work? Opposition MPs are likely to put forward amendments to any government motion to approve Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, and Bercow has suggested \u201cmanuscript\u201d amendments submitted on the day itself could be accepted. Opposition MPs have indicated they would seek to amend the deal to try to \u201cshape\u201d Brexit. This is likely to include trying to hold a second EU referendum, securing a future customs union or inserting safeguards on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. Losing another meaningful vote on the deal could lead to the PM facing an opposition motion of no confidence, paving the way for a general election and further clouding the precise future of the Brexit process. Has Johnson sent a letter to Brussels seeking a Brexit delay? Under the terms of the so-called Benn act, which was passed against the PM\u2019s wishes, Johnson was compelled to write to the EU asking for a three-month Brexit extension if he had not secured a deal by 11pm UK time on 19 October. He told the Commons on Saturday: \u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u201d But he did eventually send two letters to the European council president, Donald Tusk. There was an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn act, followed by a letter explaining why the government did not actually want an extension. There was also an explanatory letter from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, which was sent to Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, the secretary general of the Council of the European Union. Will the EU agree to an extension? Despite the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, raising doubts over the likelihood of another Brexit delay, that decision needs to be taken by all 27 remaining EU states. The EU could set a different length to an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn act. The EU could decide not to formally respond to the PM\u2019s letter until it sees if Johnson can get the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament this week. If the PM gets the cill through, there could be a special gathering of EU leaders on 28 October. If the deal needs more time at that stage to get through parliament, leaders could agree to a short \u201ctechnical\u201d extension. Here\u2019s a helpful Q&amp;A from the Press Association on the state of play: Why did a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal not go ahead on Saturday? MPs voted by a majority of 16 to back an amendment put forward by the former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin to withhold approval of the latest deal agreed between Johnson and Brussels \u201cunless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d. Letwin, who lost the Tory whip for voting against the government on Brexit previously, said the amendment was \u201cinsurance\u201d against the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by mistake on the scheduled deadline of 31 October. After he lost the vote, the prime minister decided not to have the so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his deal. When will Johnson next try to get his Brexit deal through parliament? The government is set to bring the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed for Brexit \u2013 to the Commons this coming week. However, time is running out to beat the 31 October deadline because the European parliament would also need to ratify it. Ministers could try to hold additional sittings to get the legislation through. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the government wanted to hold another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s deal on Monday and would make an emergency business statement to achieve this. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said he would consider whether to allow the government\u2019s plans. Does Johnson have the numbers to achieve a Commons majority for his Brexit deal? In the current hung parliament, much will hinge on the PM securing support from pro-Brexit Tories who voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal on three occasions, plus the 21 former Conservatives who lost the whip over the issue of a no-deal Brexit. The former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd has indicated she will support Johnson\u2019s deal and thinks there is a \u201ccoalition for getting the prime minister\u2019s deal through\u201d. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he believed the government had enough backing, telling the Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWe seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons.\u201d The DUP is strongly opposed to Johnson\u2019s deal due to the arrangements for Northern Ireland, so the backing of enough Labour MPs in leave-supporting seats will also be vital. Moving away from Brexit, Boris Johnson has held telephone talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, about the situation in Syria. Johnson expressed concern over Turkey\u2019s military action in the north of the country, Downing Street said. The two leaders are looking to hold discussions with Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron on the situation, as well as issues including migration and terrorism. A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister welcomed the agreement between the US and Turkey on the temporary suspension of fighting, which he said was a step in the right direction. He hoped that the agreement would hold and minimise further casualties on all sides. \u201cBut he also underlined that there remains a great deal of concern about Turkey\u2019s military operation in north-east Syria. The prime minister and the president agreed to look for an opportunity to meet alongside President Macron and Chancellor Merkel to discuss the current situation as well as broader issues including counter-terrorism and migration.\u201d As he emerged from a \u201cshort and normal\u201d meeting with EU ambassadors in Brussels this morning, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, joked with reporters, saying: \u201cYou are very patient,\u201d and adding \u201cMe too, me too.\u201d Barnier said he was taking the next step on ratifying the deal struck with the UK and would update the European parliament tomorrow. He said the request for a three0month Brexit delay was a matter for Donald Tusk, the EU council\u2019s president, and would be dealt with \u201cin the next few days\u201d. The extension was not discussed by ambassadors today. Deciding whether to delay Brexit and avoid no deal is a decision for EU leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s above my pay grade,\u201d one ambassador told ITV News. The EU will wait until the Brexit deal comes up in front of MPs on Tuesday before making decisions on the terms of a further extension. With MPs likely to vote on a series of amendments to the deal including a confirmatory referendum, Brussels is reluctant to be dragged into the political drama in Westminster. EU ambassadors agreed this morning that the withdrawal agreement would be sent to the European parliament on Monday. MEPs could vote on it on Thursday if the Commons has given its approval. Michael Gove has disclosed that the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer contingency plan to handle a no-deal Brexit is being triggered. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is in charge of preparations for a no-deal outcome, said the risk of such a scenario had increased due to MPs forcing the government to ask Brussels for another delay to the Brexit date. Some Westminster observers viewed the move as an attempt to increase the pressure on MPs to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Gove told Sky News: \u201cThe risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European council will grant an extension. And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no deal is accelerated. \u201cIt means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer. It means that we are preparing to ensure that if no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.\u201d The DUP MP Sammy Wilson on supporting the Letwin amendment and the party\u2019s position. Asked if the EU would be open to an extension, Michel Barnier told reporters that the European council president, Donald Tusk, would consider the next stage. Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said there had been a \u201cvery short and normal meeting\u201d of EU ambassadors this morning to take the next steps to ratify the withdrawal agreement. \u201cTomorrow I will await the European parliament,\u201d he said. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole on the current state of parliament: The Scottish Conservative MP Luke Graham has insisted a no-deal Brexit is what the party has been trying to avoid all along. \u201cWhat we saw in the last week is the prime minister actually deliver a deal that delivers on a lot of the objectives that we were trying to achieve as a country,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland programme. \u201cThere\u2019s less discussion about no deal, it\u2019s a discussion about we\u2019ve got a deal, the EU have agreed it, it\u2019s now for us to agree it as well. \u201cThe prime minister has written his letters in accordance with the law and now we\u2019re focusing on getting a deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one on the table and it\u2019s time for MPs right across the House of Commons to come together and actually vote for that deal so we can move forward.\u201d Sir Oliver Letwin says he is \u201cabsolutely behind the government now\u201d and will back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as amended. He tabled an amendment on Saturday to prevent an unintended no-deal Brexit. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has clarified the position on goods moving from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland. He told the Andrew Marr Show: \u201cIf it\u2019s going into the EU then it ought to be able to take place without any extra frictions or any extra tariffs. If it\u2019s going into other parts of the world then you have to look at the arrangements either the EU has that we accede to, or the new arrangements that the UK puts in place.\u201d Raab added the EU would not allow the UK to \u201ccherry pick\u201d the same arrangements that had been given to Northern Ireland. \u201cThis is only being offered in relation to Northern Ireland because of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.\u201d Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll on the DUP\u2019s position Some interesting polling in the Sunday Times Scotland this morning found that Scottish voters would prefer the SNP to be pushing for a second EU referendum before another election. The Panelbase poll taken between before SNP conference last weekend \u2013 during which there was a great deal more discussion of a second referendum on independence than on EU membership \u2013 found that only 26% supported the election-first stance, while 46% would prefer another referendum. And among SNP voters, six out of 10 would prefer the priority to be another vote on Brexit. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has confirmed the party will bring a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, potentially later in the week. Blackford told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland programme: \u201cWe are prepared, once we\u2019ve got that extension in place, to take our responsibilities and move a motion of no confidence and I would be looking for parliamentary time to do that and I would expect everyone else to step up.\u201d He said Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour in sending multiple letters to the EU last night proved he was \u201cnot treating the office with any respect or dignity\u201d. Blackford would not be drawn on what court action might follow from the weekend \u2013 the SNP MP Joanna Cherry\u2019s ongoing case regarding the PM\u2019s compliance with the Benn act still has court time reserved for this Monday \u2013 but he said he would \u201cstrongly suspect we may see action taking place at the courts in the coming days\u201d. He restated that the SNP would support a confirmatory referendum, but added: \u201cIf we are going to move forward to people\u2019s vote then we do need a government in place to support that, we need a general election too.\u201d Keir Starmer believes the prime minister has taken a \u201csilly approach\u201d to the Benn act and has accused him of being \u201cchildlike\u201d. Following yesterday\u2019s Commons defeat, Boris Johnson called on EU leaders to reject any extension of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. Starmer told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show: \u201cThe law is very clear. He should have signed one letter in accordance with the law. If we crash out because of what he has done with the letters [...] without a deal, he bears personal responsibility for that.\u201d He added that Labour would be open to talking to the DUP following their opposition to Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. He said: \u201cI would openly invite the DUP to talk to us. If you want to work with us to improve the situation we\u2019re in, our door is open to that discussion.\u201d Labour will back an amendment next week calling for a referendum on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has said. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has insisted a Conservative government would work to protect workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. He said British businesses and workers need \u201ca set of regulations that is smarter and tailored towards them\u201d. \u201cWorkers are far safer under a Conservative government, given our economic record and the protections we\u2019re putting in place, than they are under this shower of a Labour party,\u201d Raab told the Andrew Marr Show. Asked why the \u201clevel playing field\u201d for workers\u2019 regulation had been taken out of the legally binding withdrawal agreement and put into the non-legally binding political declaration, Raab responded: \u201cWe\u2019re basically saying these issues of employment rights, environmental protections, are so important, and the circumstances in the UK are obviously different. \u201cWe actually should make sure politicians are accountable to the voters watching the show. Why would you abdicate responsibility for those issues if they\u2019re so important?\u201d Michael Gove has said the risk of the UK leaving the EU without a deal has grown as a result of yesterday\u2019s vote. Reasserting the government\u2019s belief that Brexit will definitely happen on October 31, the cabinet minister told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cThe risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European council will grant an extension.\u201d He said he would chair a cabinet meeting later today in order to trigger Operation Yellowhammer, the government\u2019s contingency plan to prepare for a possible no-deal outcome. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing to ensure that if no extension is granted that we have done everything possible in order to leave without a deal,\u201d said Gove. Although the prime minister has already been forced to send a letter requesting a further Brexit delay, Gove insisted that \u201cparliament can\u2019t change the determination\u201d of the government to leave the EU by Halloween. \u201cWe know that the European Union want us to leave, we know that we have a deal that allows us to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to leave on October 31st. We have the means and ability to do so.\u201d He said he was optimistic that the government would get enough votes in order to get Boris Johnson\u2019s deal through the Commons \u2013 in which case there would be no extension. The former Tory minister Amber Rudd has said she feels Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was better than the one currently being offered by Johnson. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge, Rudd, now an independent, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as Theresa May\u2019s deal. I regret the fact that we don\u2019t have effectively a backstop for the whole of the country. Instead it\u2019s only Northern Ireland. \u201cIn terms of the economy, it\u2019s very good for Northern Ireland but it\u2019s less good for the union. I thought that Theresa May\u2019s deal was the right deal. I think this is not as good.\u201d However, Rudd stressed that she still supported Johnson\u2019s deal. \u201cWe have to make sure that we don\u2019t leave with no deal \u2026 I want to support it and I will, and I think, not all of us, but most of us former Conservatives, who supported the Letwin amendment will do so as well,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely right to say we don\u2019t want to leave with no deal but we do want to leave with a deal and this deal from the prime minister is good enough for me.\u201d The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has also been talking to Sophy Ridge this morning. After being mocked on Thursday for his seeming own-goal in defending the law that would delay Brexit, Farage reaffirmed to the Sky presenter that he would rather have a Brexit extension followed by a general election than see Boris Johnson\u2019s deal being passed in the Commons. \u201cI want to leave on the 31st October with a clean-break Brexit because that\u2019s the only Brexit worth having,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a general election, so an extension for a few weeks in which we can have a general election is a much better outcome than signing up to a treaty that becomes part of international law that binds us in foreign policy and in many, many other areas.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are going to have to be on a level playing field with the rest of Europe, which means we still haven\u2019t taken back control of our laws. This is not Brexit.\u201d He described Johnson\u2019s deal as \u201ca new EU treaty\u201d, adding that \u201call it does is take us on to the next stage of negotiations\u201d. Our video team were at the huge People\u2019s Vote march in London yesterday, following some of the estimated one million anti-Brexit protesters as they demanded a fresh referendum. You can watch their work here: John McDonnell has said Boris Johnson has behaved \u201ca bit like a spoilt brat\u201d after the prime minister sent an unsigned letter to the EU asking for a delay, and then a second arguing against it. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on her Sunday show, the shadow chancellor said: \u201cHe may well be in contempt of parliament or the courts themselves. Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it, and this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first, I think it flies in the face of what the parliament and the courts have decided.\u201d He added that another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cpointless\u201d until MPs had been able to scrutinise the legislation needed to implement it. \u201cUntil you see the legislation, you don\u2019t know the detail, and as someone said yesterday, the devil is in the detail,\u201d McDonnell said. While he said an amendment for a second referendum on Brexit would \u201calmost inevitably\u201d come up in parliament over the next few days, McDonnell would not confirm whether Labour would bring one forward, instead emphasising that the party would argue for a general election. \u201cIn a general election we would negotiate a sensible option for Brexit and we\u2019d take that back to the people,\u201d he said. Morning, it\u2019s Amy Walker here. I\u2019ll be kicking off the live blog today. The Sunday papers worked late into last night reacting to Boris Johnson\u2019s defeat in the Commons yesterday. The Observer carried a picture of the People\u2019s Vote march alongside news of the prime minister\u2019s \u201chumiliating defeat\u201d. The Mirror took a similar approach, declaring that \u201cBlustering Boris\u201d had been \u201cbeaten again\u201d. Meanwhile, others, such as the Sunday Times, painted a picture of a dedicated leader battling the \u201cBrexit wreckers\u201d. The Mail on Sunday described MPs who had helped to delay Johnson\u2019s deal as the \u201cHouse of Fools\u201d and the Sunday Express asked \u201cWhy Won\u2019t They Let Us Leave?\u201d. As yet another turbulent day gets under way, I\u2019ll be keeping you updated with what ministers and MPs are saying on the Sunday politics shows. First up is Sophy Ridge on Sky News, who is scheduled to interview John McDonnell, Nigel Farage, Amber Rudd and Michael Gove among others.",

The first half I didn\u2019t like. We gave Man United opportunities to do what they wanted to do \u2013 just being <em>aggressive</em>, making challenges everywhere. You have to pass through the lines. There were opportunities to do that but we didn\u2019t see them. </p> <p>\u201cThey were better than we were, for what they wanted to do, so they defended well. But they scored a goal which shows all the problems with VAR. I\u2019m sure Mr Atkinson let play continue because [it could be checked later by VAR], and then the VAR says \u2018There was contact, it\u2019s a foul, but if you saw it differently it\u2019s...\u2019. 100 per cent it was like this. For me it was a clear foul. We cannot change that, it\u2019s just a general problem with VAR. </p> <p>\u201cPretty much everything went against us today and we still didn\u2019t lose, so that\u2019s okay. And Adam scored, which is a wonderful story to be honest. Our first-half performance was not about confidence \u2013 it was more about momentum. They had it because they were purely there to defend us. If you set up a team like Man United, with the quality they have, and make them just defend, that\u2019s really difficult [to play against]. </p> <p>\u201cIn the second half we were better. We deserved a point, 100 per cent. It\u2019s just a point. Since I\u2019ve been in England, Man United have always played against us like this; they defend with all they have. Everybody built this game up like a mountain, but one team only tries to defend and one has to \u2026 make the game. We\u2019ll take the point \u2013 it\u2019s much better than no points \u2013 but it\u2019s not that we feel we\u2019ve won something by scoring late today. It\u2019s just a point, let\u2019s carry on.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T17:56:21.288Z\">at 6.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dac9b8f8f08c78d1cb4efdd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T17:38:28.885Z\">6.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cI was listening on BBC World Service</strong> in France and following the MBM,\u201d says Andrew Dobson. \u201cWeirdly, you were always ahead of the radio.

He saved us today and that could be a big point come the end of the season. We could have been better \u2013 we know that \u2013 but if you can\u2019t win, don\u2019t lose. We were sloppy first half, not fluid enough; it was quite scrappy. Second half I thought we caused them more problems, especially towards the end of the game, but we couldn\u2019t find a winner.</p> <p>\u201cI felt the referee gave a lot of similar free-kicks to them in the first half, and then he didn\u2019t give one to us on their goal. But it\u2019s no excuse, we\u2019ve got to defend it better. Our performance level wasn\u2019t up to our usual standards. We have to take the positives from the game and learn from the negatives.</p> <p><strong>Adam Lallana</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe manager just asked me to make an impact when I came on. I thought Ox did extremely well when he came on. If we\u2019re gonna win the league we\u2019ll need a squad, not just an XI, and that\u2019s what we can take out of today\u2019s game. We weren\u2019t at our best so it\u2019s a point gained. </p> <p>\u201cPeople were saying it would be an easy three points for us. That\u2019s never the case, and form goes out the window in these games. It felt like we controlled the game in the second half.

Although it was a scruffy game of few chances, there was always something going on and it was fascinating tactically. </p> <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer set United up expertly in the first half, with a 3-4-1-2 formation and split strikers, but they ran out of steam in the second. Solskjaer was arguably too passive with his substitutions, although he didn\u2019t have many options. And while Liverpool were nowhere near their awesome best, they probably deserved a draw for their persistence and territorial dominance. </p> <p>There was VAR controversy, inevitably, and a soup\u00e7on of needle. United look deflated because of the late equaliser. When the dust settles, they will reflect on a pretty good day. Marcus Rashford on the talismanic side of immense, and there were plenty of signs that United are going in the right direction. In this case, admittedly, that means moving from 14th to 13th in the league, but fourth place is still a realistic ambition.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T17:44:01.512Z\">at 6.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dac97fc8f08c78d1cb4efcc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T17:23:23.904Z\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full time: Manchester United 1-1 Liverpool</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peep peep! </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dac97e78f08993584c89acd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T17:23:05.700Z\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>No penalty! </strong>A cross from the right hit Fred on the shoulder, and they are still looking at it.

The manner in which Jurgen Klopp ran straight down the touchline suggests they will play far better in the second half.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dac883c8f0898437061a670\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T16:16:20.487Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>45+1 min </strong>Pereira wins a corner after a slick move involving James and the increasingly superb Rashford.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dac88248f08142786c4f59e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T16:15:42.112Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>45 min</strong> There will be one minute of added time. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dac87c58f08993584c89a9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T16:14:55.086Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NO GOAL!

Manchester United v Liverpool is a fixture so big it deserves <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8BEyPzHsVo\">its own Blackadder simile</a>. And this one feels even bigger than usual. The context of today\u2019s match can be summarised by a number and a football season. </p> <p>The number is 18. If Liverpool win today, they will equal Manchester City\u2019s English record of 18 consecutive league wins, and move three points closer to finally adding to their 18 league titles.</p> <p>The season is 1989-90. That\u2019s when Liverpool last won the title, and when United last had such a bad start to the season. A corollary of those is that it was also the last time Liverpool came to Old Trafford as such overwhelming favourites. In March 1990 they won 2-1 and scored three goals \u2013 two from John Barnes and an absurd own-goal from Ronnie Whelan.</p> <p>That game was 16th vs 2nd in the table; today it\u2019s 14th v 1st, and Liverpool are odds-on with every bookmaker we could find during an admittedly cursory internet search. They don\u2019t win often at Old Trafford \u2013 eight times in the last 50 visits \u2013 but those victories are intrinsically memorable. There have been five in the Premier League era, three Danny Murphys from 2000-04 and two routs in 2008-09 and 2013-14. The last of those, a 3-0 humiliation that almost propelled Liverpool to the title, is a potential precedent for today. </p> <p>An experienced United side threw the towel in that afternoon. If something similar happens here, the pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may become unbearable. It\u2019s unlikely, but not entirely beyond the realms, that Liverpool could get a United manager sacked for the second consecutive season.</p> <p>But there are some precedents in United\u2019s favour, football being a funny old game and all. Ten years ago this weekend, United went to Anfield with Liverpool in turmoil. The beach-ball goal at Sunderland made them a laughing stock, they were on a run of four straight defeats and it was open season on Rafael Benitez.</p> <p>A cautious United missed the chance to put a nervous Liverpool away, and a rousing second-half performance gave Liverpool a 2-0 victory. And although Benitez left in the summer anyway, that win ultimately helped deny United a record fourth consecutive title.</p> <p>United have already helped deny Liverpool one title, with that dogged 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in February, and would probably give up their entire roster of official partners for a statement victory today. Liverpool will be happy with any old record-equalling win, but they\u2019d love to humiliate United if possible.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s just one more thing: it\u2019ll be emotional.<br></p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 4.30pm. </strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T14:12:21.375Z\">at 3.12pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. Thanks for your company and emails; night. Jose Mourinho\u2019s response to Klopp\u2019s comments \u201cHe didn\u2019t like the menu. He likes meat and he got fish. so he was not happy. They are of course much stronger against opponents who give them a chance of transitions and counter-attacks. United didn\u2019t do that. And he didn\u2019t like the menu.\u201d Here\u2019s Jurgen Klopp \u201cSo, the result is now okay. It\u2019s not what we wanted beforehand, obviously, but with the way the game developed we have to be happy with a point. The performance was \u2026 we had good moments in the second half. The first half I didn\u2019t like. We gave Man United opportunities to do what they wanted to do \u2013 just being aggressive, making challenges everywhere. You have to pass through the lines. There were opportunities to do that but we didn\u2019t see them. \u201cThey were better than we were, for what they wanted to do, so they defended well. But they scored a goal which shows all the problems with VAR. I\u2019m sure Mr Atkinson let play continue because [it could be checked later by VAR], and then the VAR says \u2018There was contact, it\u2019s a foul, but if you saw it differently it\u2019s...\u2019. 100 per cent it was like this. For me it was a clear foul. We cannot change that, it\u2019s just a general problem with VAR. \u201cPretty much everything went against us today and we still didn\u2019t lose, so that\u2019s okay. And Adam scored, which is a wonderful story to be honest. Our first-half performance was not about confidence \u2013 it was more about momentum. They had it because they were purely there to defend us. If you set up a team like Man United, with the quality they have, and make them just defend, that\u2019s really difficult [to play against]. \u201cIn the second half we were better. We deserved a point, 100 per cent. It\u2019s just a point. Since I\u2019ve been in England, Man United have always played against us like this; they defend with all they have. Everybody built this game up like a mountain, but one team only tries to defend and one has to \u2026 make the game. We\u2019ll take the point \u2013 it\u2019s much better than no points \u2013 but it\u2019s not that we feel we\u2019ve won something by scoring late today. It\u2019s just a point, let\u2019s carry on.\u201d \u201cI was listening on BBC World Service in France and following the MBM,\u201d says Andrew Dobson. \u201cWeirdly, you were always ahead of the radio. How does that happen?\u201d If I tell you, I\u2019ll have to kill you in two minutes\u2019 time. Post-match reaction Jordan Henderson \u201cI delighted for Adam, because he\u2019s worked so hard and he deserves that. He saved us today and that could be a big point come the end of the season. We could have been better \u2013 we know that \u2013 but if you can\u2019t win, don\u2019t lose. We were sloppy first half, not fluid enough; it was quite scrappy. Second half I thought we caused them more problems, especially towards the end of the game, but we couldn\u2019t find a winner. \u201cI felt the referee gave a lot of similar free-kicks to them in the first half, and then he didn\u2019t give one to us on their goal. But it\u2019s no excuse, we\u2019ve got to defend it better. Our performance level wasn\u2019t up to our usual standards. We have to take the positives from the game and learn from the negatives. Adam Lallana \u201cThe manager just asked me to make an impact when I came on. I thought Ox did extremely well when he came on. If we\u2019re gonna win the league we\u2019ll need a squad, not just an XI, and that\u2019s what we can take out of today\u2019s game. We weren\u2019t at our best so it\u2019s a point gained. \u201cPeople were saying it would be an easy three points for us. That\u2019s never the case, and form goes out the window in these games. It felt like we controlled the game in the second half. We\u2019re still unbeaten so there are huge positives considering we didn\u2019t play our best.\u201d That\u2019s it. Liverpool\u2019s winning run ends at 17, one short of the record, but they will be happy enough after Adam Lallana\u2019s late equaliser put them six points clear at the top. Although it was a scruffy game of few chances, there was always something going on and it was fascinating tactically. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer set United up expertly in the first half, with a 3-4-1-2 formation and split strikers, but they ran out of steam in the second. Solskjaer was arguably too passive with his substitutions, although he didn\u2019t have many options. And while Liverpool were nowhere near their awesome best, they probably deserved a draw for their persistence and territorial dominance. There was VAR controversy, inevitably, and a soup\u00e7on of needle. United look deflated because of the late equaliser. When the dust settles, they will reflect on a pretty good day. Marcus Rashford on the talismanic side of immense, and there were plenty of signs that United are going in the right direction. In this case, admittedly, that means moving from 14th to 13th in the league, but fourth place is still a realistic ambition. Peep peep! No penalty! A cross from the right hit Fred on the shoulder, and they are still looking at it. It\u2019s been cleared, but Liverpool have a corner. 90+6 min: VAR check for a Liverpool penalty! 90+5 min Oxlade-Chamberlain overhits a fairly straightforward crossfield pass to Alexander-Arnold, who would have been in on the right side of the area. 90+4 min Brandon Williams replaces Andreas Pereira for United. 90+3 min Pereira\u2019s corner is headed clear by Matip. 90+3 min Now James wins a corner for United on the counter-attack. As much as it anything, it will buy them a bit of time. 90+1 min Oxlade-Chamberlain, 25 yards from goal, cracks a superb daisy-cutter with his left foot that beats de Gea and goes this far wide of the post. 90 min United are out on their feet. There will be five minutes of added time. 89 min If Liverpool win this, it will empower them beyond belief for the rest of the season. They have a bit of a swagger on for the first time all day. 88 min A poor header from Lindelof goes straight to Alexander-Arnold, who swishes the bouncing ball just over the bar from the right side of the area. De Gea had it covered. 87 min Liverpool have a great chance to nick this, because the place has gone really flat and United look tired. It was made by Robertson on the left. His low cross, not his best actually, was missed by Lindelof at the near post and ran through to Lallana, who tapped into an open net from four yards. Liverpool could yet make it 18 wins in a row! Adam Lallana has equalised for Liverpool! 84 min The first Manchester United change: Anthony Martial replaces Marcus Rashford, who has been immense. 83 min James charges down the left, ignores a rugby tackle from Matip and flashes a low ball across the face of goal. It\u2019s recycled by Wan-Bissaka and then Fred, who whistles a left-footed shot just wide of the far post. I think Alisson had it covered. 82 min Liverpool make their final change: Naby Keita for Gini Wijnaldum. 81 min United have now moved to a 5-4-1 formation, with James on the left wing. I\u2019m surprised Martial hasn\u2019t come on, although I don\u2019t suppose you can take Rashford off when he\u2019s playing like this. 80 min \u201cThese two pub sides are giving it their all,\u201d says Kevin Porter. \u201cWhen does the Premier League match start?\u201d 79 min Oxlade-Chamberlain drifts out of play to huge cheers. Liverpool\u2019s pass selection has been weirdly poor for most of the match. 78 min \u201cFred and Pereira have been wonderful today,\u201d says Manasvin. \u201can underrated part of what Pereira has done is the way he\u2019s locked Fabinho up. You expect Fab to usually be heavily involved in Liverpool\u2019s first stage build-up but he\u2019s been closed off very well today. Props to Fred for covering spaces in midfield properly as well, he\u2019s ensured that Wijnaldum doesn\u2019t have the chance to twist and turn his way out like he did in the initial stages.\u201d Agreed, especially about Pereira and Fabinho, who is such an underrated influence on Liverpool\u2019s play. 77 min Young is lucky not to be booked for a late tackle on Lallana, a point Virgil van Dijk makes in his ear before play restarts. 75 min Liverpool have completely dominated possession in the second half, yet I don\u2019t think de Gea has had a save to make. It\u2019s been a very strange game. 73 min If it stays like this, and that\u2019s an appreciable if, it\u2019ll complete a very, very good day for Manchester United. 72 min Fred, on the left side of the box, slashes a half-volley well wide from 15 yards. It was a nice move from United involving Pereira, Rashford, Young and then Pereira again. 71 min Adam Lallana replaces Jordan Henderson. Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville on Sky are slating Liverpool\u2019s performance, with Carragher suggesting there might be a \u201cmental block\u201d about playing at Old Trafford. 71 min \u201cHe\u2019s only gone and done it, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAndy Murray won! He bloomin\u2019 well won! A set and a break down, and he still won. He\u2019s crying, I\u2019m crying. He only had one hip nine months ago. Now he\u2019s thanking his opponent and the crowd. I love him. No Hawkeye/VAR drama either. I still love it, but football has a lot to learn.\u201d Ya dancer! 70 min Fabinho is booked for a foul on the breaking James. 69 min Mo Salah is having a sensational game. 67 min Rashford almost grabs a second on the break. Pereira found him on the left with a good crossfield pass, and he waited for James to make an off-the-ball run from centre to left. Rashford used James by not using him, cutting inside Matip before drilling a low shot just wide from 25 yards. Alisson had it covered but it was well struck. 64 min Oxlade-Chamberlain drags a shot wide from 20 yards. It\u2019s all Liverpool now, working the ball from side to side as they look for an opening. United, who started with such intensity, are starting to look slightly weary. 63 min \u201cI simply can\u2019t believe you\u2019re allowing your outrageous pro-United bias to show, even going as far as to report a 1-0 scoreline,\u201d sniffs Matt Dony. \u201cWe all saw the build-up. It\u2019s supposed to be a walk-over. Liverpool must be winning. Surely. #BakowskiIn.\u201d 62 min That tactical change from Solskjaer was a switch from 3-4-1-2 to 3-5-2, with Pereira moving a bit deeper. It\u2019s been an interesting game tactically. 61 min For the first time in the match, Liverpool are being allowed more time on the ball in deeper positions. Robertson\u2019s low cross goes right across the face of goal before being cleared by Young. United can\u2019t get out, and it might soon be time for Anthony Martial. 60 min Liverpool bring on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for Divock Origi. That looks like a switch to 4-4-2, with Oxlade-Chamberlain left and Mane and Firmino up front. James is okay to continue. 59 min James is having a concussion test. The break in play allows Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the chance to give some tactical advice to Rashford. 57 min James is down again, having been whacked by Fabinho, but Liverpool play on. After about 40 seconds, Matip kicks the ball out of play and gets a minor rollocking from Jordan Henderson. 56 min This is a good spell for Liverpool, their best of the match. Origi loses McTominay and hits a fierce shot that is blocked by Rojo. United have struggled to get out in the last few minutes. 52 min Liverpool look slightly better since half-time, though it is still a very scruffy game. That suits United. Rashford, after a listless start, is having a minor stormer. 51 min \u201cI had a friend once who \u2018died in the wool\u2019,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cHeart attack while mid-intim [that\u2019ll do \u2013 Smyth].\u201d 50 min James is flattened by a firm but fair tackle from van Dijk. He looks really groggy, although it\u2019s not a head injury this time; he\u2019s been winded. 49 min \u201cIn old money Mane\u2019s goal would have stood,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cIn new money it was correctly disallowed. I hate new money.\u201d 48 min Liverpool have switched to a 4-2-3-1: Henderson right, Mane left and Firmino behind Origi. 47 min Henderson\u2019s grossly overhit cross is retrieved by the absurd Robertson, who keeps the ball in play Steve McMahon-style - okay, not quite as spectacularly as that - and then whips in a very good cross that is headed away. 47 min \u201cSurely,\u201d says Sean Doyle, \u201cthere\u2019s someone over at Guardian Towers who isn\u2019t a died in wool Man Utd fan to do an unbiased MBM.\u201d Fraid not. Manchester Guardian, innit. Seriously, though, to which bits do you object? 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half. \u201cHonestly so so sick of the complaining about VAR,\u201d writes Cnoyes. \u201cGet over it. It was NOT a foul on Origi, and it was a handball on Man\u00e9. Justice was served. Stop whinging.\u201d Thanks for clearing that up. \u201cThose two VAR decisions are entirely consistent with how it\u2019s been used all season,\u201d says Oliver Atkinson. \u201cWhen there\u2019s something vaguely debatable like a foul they don\u2019t want to overturn the original decision, when there\u2019s something 100% quantifiable like handball or an offside they will overturn it. This may not be right, but it\u2019s consistent.\u201d Yes, on reflection I think you\u2019re right. To some it was clear and obvious, to others Origi made a meal of the contact and had lost the ball. The problem is with the protocol. God, I am so, so bored of talking about VAR. VAR department \u201cElated as I am that the goal was given, VAR is driving me absolutely up the wall,\u201d says Matthew Richman. \u201cThe letdown of having to wait for a few guys in a trailer to watch TV absolutely kills the celebration. I\u2019ve been let down by terrible calls before and I understand the arguments for, but I\u2019m wondering if the obsession with a fairness has finally crossed the line.\u201d The main argument for VAR was that it would remove a sense of injustice from football. In fact, it has increased it. I would get rid of it, but there\u2019s about as much chance of that as there is of somebody putting the internet back in its box. Mane\u2019s \u2018goal\u2019 A few of you have written to say it should have been given because his hand was not in an unnatural position. But the new law says that all goals will be disallowed if the ball hits the scorer\u2019s hand, regardless of context, in the build-up. Peep peep! Manchester United deservedly lead, although Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal should probably have been disallowed by VAR. Liverpool have been very poor by their stratospheric standards, and so far have been outfought and outthought. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s 3-4-1-2 system, with split strikers, has worked brilliantly. The manner in which Jurgen Klopp ran straight down the touchline suggests they will play far better in the second half. 45+1 min Pereira wins a corner after a slick move involving James and the increasingly superb Rashford. 45 min There will be one minute of added time. NO GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Liverpool There\u2019s no argument with this one. The ball hit Mane\u2019s hand as he controlled a long ball forward. The rest was excellent; he muscled Lindelof aside and slid the ball past de Gea. Yes, it\u2019s handball, so this will be disallowed. Mane equalises and now United are appealing for handball! 42 min The more you see the replay of the goal, the more it looks like a - yep - clear and obvious foul on Origi. 41 min For all the occasional frustrations of watching Marcus Rashford, his big-game record is outstanding. 39 min In accordance with the current VAR protocol, it was the right decision to award the goal, but I also think eight out of 10 neutrals would say that was a foul on Origi. The goal itself was lovely. James ran into space down the right and curled a brilliant pass/cross between the keeper and defenders. Rashford lost Matip with a beautiful double-run, shaping to move towards the near post before pulling in the opposite direction, and forced the bouncing ball past Alisson from close range. GOAL GIVEN! Jurgen Klopp is fuming. It looked like a foul from Lindelof on Origi, but it didn\u2019t pass the clear-and-obvious test. I think this will be disallowed. Rashford gives United the lead but Liverpool think there was a foul in the build-up! 36 min De Gea makes a better save from Firmino\u2019s header, but he\u2019d been flagged offside. 34 min De Gea makes a good save from Firmino after a smart break from Liverpool. Matip swept a fine long pass out to Mane on the right. He kept the ball in, charged down the wing and then cut the ball back perfectly for Firmino to strike first time on the run from 15 yards. He didn\u2019t really get hold of it, however, and de Gea plunged to his right to make an ultimately comfortable save. 32 min As with Everton yesterday, United\u2019s performance suggests the manager certainly hasn\u2019t lost the dressing-room. 31 min Young goes down after taking Henderson\u2019s hand in his face. It was accidental. 30 min Henderson\u2019s flat cross is volleyed wide from 12 yards by the stretching Firmino. It was a quarter-chance at best. 29 min Wan-Bissaka is having a terrific game. Whatever happens at United in the next few years, and all bets are off, it should be a long time before they need to scout another right-back, never mind 800. 28 min A brilliant cross from Wan-Bissaka is serenely cleared by van Dijk at the near post. That was a vital bit of defending. 27 min Rashford, on the left, zips away from Henderson and then Matip in the area, only to mistime his attempted cutback towards James. It was a lovely run, though, and he\u2019s looked sharp in the last 10 minutes. United are playing with split strikers, as they did to good effect when Solskjaer was caretaker manager. 25 min McTominay takes matters into his hands, marauding forward from midfield before hitting a low shot from 25 yards that is comfortably saved by Alisson. It was a good run but a fairly tame shot. 25 min The game is too important to feel boring, but if this was Mansfield v Swindon we\u2019d be calling it a stinker. 24 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Julian Smith. \u201cI stumbled across this today. Great doc about the history of the rivalry between these two great cities and the mutual respect that we hopefully now acknowledge between each other (grudgingly no doubt). We\u2019re closer than either side would now care to admit. Of course, you won\u2019t have a chance to watch while there\u2019s so much action going on but Merseyside/GM reds should appreciate it (even though it\u2019s an LFCTV production).\u201d It\u2019s interesting that nobody (as far as I\u2019m aware) has written a book about the rivalry. There are plenty, for example, on Barcelona and Real Madrid, though I realise that\u2019s a bigger, broader rivalry. 23 min I\u2019d be tempted to switch Mane back to his usual position on the left. Liverpool haven\u2019t really threatened yet, despite looking the calmer, classier side. 22 min Young\u2019s corner is punched away by Alisson. 21 min Rashford leaves van Dijk on all fours and finds Pereira, whose shot deflects wide for a corner. Young will take it. 21 min United break through Rashford, whose attempted through pass to James is blocked by Matip. It wasn\u2019t a great pass. 20 min Andy Robertson\u2019s cross is cleared by Maguire as far as ... Robertson, who storms forward to win the ball himself. I love watching him so much. He\u2019s an elemental force. 19 min \u201cIt\u2019s coming,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cLiverpool is starting to control the midfield. United is dropping back. United is being reduced to knocking it long and hoping. A Liverpool goal, like Winter, is coming.\u201d Henry? 17 min Wan-Bissaka plays a good pass into the area for Pereira, whose speculative backheel goes through to Alisson with no United forwards in sight. Gary Neville makes the valid point that James and Rashford have both been pretty static so far. 17 min The match is starting to settle into the expected pattern, with Liverpool dominating possession. Marcus Rashford is already starting to look a bit hacked off. 15 min Maguire drives a crossfield pass straight out of play. It\u2019s been a good start from United in terms of aggression and endeavour, but not quality in possession. 13 min Liverpool are starting to stir as an attacking force. Wijnaldum neatly slips both McTominay and Fred before hitting a low shot from 25 yards that is comfortably saved by de Gea. 12 min Pereira leads a promising attack, sees Wan-Bissaka in space on the right ... and then mishits a miserable shot from 25 yards that is claimed by Alisson. 10 min Liverpool\u2019s first decent attack. Mane heads the ball down nicely for Firmino, who surges into the area on the left before slicing a half-volley miles wide. 9 min A dangerous free-kick from Pereira on the right is supeerbly defended by Robertson at the near post. Had he missed that, Rashford would have had a clear shot from 10 yards. 9 min \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cMatt Dony should count his blessings. Maybe being a Liverpool and Wales fan ain\u2019t so bad, when you could be, say, a Dundee United and Scotland fan (wins over San Marino don\u2019t count). Even Gerwyn Price is going further in the darts than Gary Anderson these days. Although one of the year\u2019s more heart-warming stories involves the incomparable Andy Murray, who is currently giving it a right go in the final of the European Open in Antwerp. He\u2019ll lose, but still ...\u201d 8 min This has been a really aggressive start from United, summed up by a late shoulder charged by Pereira on van Dijk. Liverpool haven\u2019t got going yet. 5 min United are pressing much higher than expected, with Young and Wan-Bissaka playing as genuine wing-backs for now. A decent cross from Young - rocking up on the right in open play for some reason - flashes across goal. 3 min I take it back: United are playing a 3-4-1-2, with Pereira closer to the influential Fabinho. 2 min Young lobs a good ball down the left to Rashford, who runs at Matip but then picks the wrong option with a nothing cross that is easily cleared. 2 min Sadio Mane has started on the right for Liverpool, with Origi on the left. United\u2019s formation looks like a 3-3-2-2, with McTominay deeper than Fred and Pereira. 1 min Peep peep! United, in red, kick off from left to right. Liverpool are in white, chasing an 18th consecutive victory. \u201cJonathan Wilson has a point that United might be looking at Klopp and saying \u2018What if?\u2019,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u2018but the teamsheet suggests that they looked at Klopp, swallowed dryly and commanded Ole to \u2018PUT FIVE AT THE BACK!!!\u2019.\u201d The players emerge to the usual sound of This Is the One by the Stone Roses. It\u2019s time for business. Jose Mourinho, on Sky Sports, has just said \u201cit\u2019s very, very rare that magic tactics win a game\u201d. Everything we know is wrong. Paul Pogba is at Old Trafford, limping around with a walking stick. \u201cI\u2019m currently waiting for a flight from Brasilia to Rio on Gol Airlines before heading home to London on Norwegian Air,\u201d says Chris Hall. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure what it all means but with three Brazilians in my team today, even with no Salah, surely a 0-0 isn\u2019t on the cards?\u201d Well, three of the last six league games have ended goalless. It\u2019s not beyond the realms, especially with United playing an 5-3-0-0-0-0-2 formation. But I\u2019d expect Liverpool to win maybe 2-0 or 3-0. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re on Golless Airlines, is it. \u201cI really, really did not enjoy this morning, Rob,\u201d says our Wales/Liverpool fandom correspondent Matt Dony. \u201cThe rugby took several years off my life expectancy. I\u2019m very keen for this afternoon to be less tight and less stressful. Five or six early Liverpool goals to settle the nerves would be useful.\u201d Surely this morning was a reminder me that late victories are all the preceding misery? Axel Tuanzebe has been injured in the warm-up. Marcos Rojo replaces him and Phil Jones moves to the bench. This is the revised team news. Manchester United (possible 5-3-2) de Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Rojo, Young; Fred, McTominay, Pereira; James, Rashford. Substitutes: Romero, Ro Jones, Williams, Garner, Mata, Greenwood, Martial. Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Origi, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Adrian, Lovren, Milner, Keita, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana. Referee Martin Atkinson. Some pre-match reading David de Gea is fit for Manchester United, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka returns in what looks like a back five. Anthony Martial is on the bench. United could also play with a diamond, with Axel Tuanzebe in midfield and Andreas Pereira on Fabinho. Liverpool are without Mo Salah, who is injured, so Divock Origi comes in. Alisson returns to the starting line-up. Manchester United (possible 5-3-2) de Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Tuanzebe, Lindelof, Maguire, Young; Fred, McTominay, Pereira; James, Rashford. Substitutes: Romero, Rojo, Williams, Garner, Mata, Greenwood, Martial. Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Origi, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Adrian, Lovren, Milner, Keita, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana. Referee Martin Atkinson. Hello. Manchester United v Liverpool is a fixture so big it deserves its own Blackadder simile. And this one feels even bigger than usual. The context of today\u2019s match can be summarised by a number and a football season. The number is 18. If Liverpool win today, they will equal Manchester City\u2019s English record of 18 consecutive league wins, and move three points closer to finally adding to their 18 league titles. The season is 1989-90. That\u2019s when Liverpool last won the title, and when United last had such a bad start to the season. A corollary of those is that it was also the last time Liverpool came to Old Trafford as such overwhelming favourites. In March 1990 they won 2-1 and scored three goals \u2013 two from John Barnes and an absurd own-goal from Ronnie Whelan. That game was 16th vs 2nd in the table; today it\u2019s 14th v 1st, and Liverpool are odds-on with every bookmaker we could find during an admittedly cursory internet search. They don\u2019t win often at Old Trafford \u2013 eight times in the last 50 visits \u2013 but those victories are intrinsically memorable. There have been five in the Premier League era, three Danny Murphys from 2000-04 and two routs in 2008-09 and 2013-14. The last of those, a 3-0 humiliation that almost propelled Liverpool to the title, is a potential precedent for today. An experienced United side threw the towel in that afternoon. If something similar happens here, the pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may become unbearable. It\u2019s unlikely, but not entirely beyond the realms, that Liverpool could get a United manager sacked for the second consecutive season. But there are some precedents in United\u2019s favour, football being a funny old game and all. Ten years ago this weekend, United went to Anfield with Liverpool in turmoil. The beach-ball goal at Sunderland made them a laughing stock, they were on a run of four straight defeats and it was open season on Rafael Benitez. A cautious United missed the chance to put a nervous Liverpool away, and a rousing second-half performance gave Liverpool a 2-0 victory. And although Benitez left in the summer anyway, that win ultimately helped deny United a record fourth consecutive title. United have already helped deny Liverpool one title, with that dogged 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in February, and would probably give up their entire roster of official partners for a statement victory today. Liverpool will be happy with any old record-equalling win, but they\u2019d love to humiliate United if possible. There\u2019s just one more thing: it\u2019ll be emotional. Kick off is at 4.30pm.",

      "bodyText": "Senior Trump administration officials were on Sunday scrambling to defend the president from escalating domestic and foreign policy scandals, ranging from impeachment proceedings in Washington to the US troop withdrawal in northern Syria. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was forced to row back comments he made earlier in the week acknowledging the administration withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to elicit assistance investigating Donald Trump\u2019s political opponents. In a White House briefing on Thursday, Mulvaney listed \u201cthree issues\u201d tied to the decision to withhold almost $400m in aid. These included \u201cwhether [Ukrainian officials] were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice\u201d related to the origins of the inquiry into Russian interference in 2016 election, which Mulvaney linked to an unfounded conspiracy theory which says Ukraine was involved in the theft of emails from Democratic servers. Asked if that was tantamount to a quid pro quo, Mulvaney said: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d Speaking to Fox News Sunday, Mulvaney claimed his words had been misreported, stating he had not acknowledged a quid pro quo. \u201cThat\u2019s what people are saying that I said, but I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he said. But he had clearly changed his line, now stating there were only \u201ctwo reasons\u201d aid was withheld \u2013 \u201crampant corruption in Ukraine\u201d and \u201cwhether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine\u201d. The existence of a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine is at the centre of an impeachment inquiry led by Democrats in the House of Representatives. The committees involved are also investigating Trump\u2019s request that the Ukrainain government commence an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The president made the request during a 25 July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Mulvaney has denied that the Biden request was tied to the decision to withhold aid. The acting chief of staff is under the spotlight in the impeachment inquiry after testimony from a state department official, George Kent, placed him at the centre of efforts to create a separate diplomatic channel to Ukraine staffed by Trump loyalists including outgoing energy secretary Rick Perry and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Democrats are weighing up whether to summon Mulvaney, according to reports. Reports also emerged on Sunday that Mulvaney was facing ejection from his post before the impeachment inquiry began. CNN reported that Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and other advisers began screening for new candidates last month. Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman, is the third White House chief of staff under Trump although he retains the \u201cacting\u201d prefix. He said on Sunday he had not considered tendering his resignation this week. \u201cI\u2019m very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No,\u201d he said. The Ukraine scandal is only one of a number in which the administration is currently embroiled. On Saturday evening Trump was forced into an embarrassing climbdown, announcing his golf resort in Doral, Florida would no longer host the G7 summit next year following bi-partisan criticism of the decision. In an attempt to defend the move, Mulvaney said: \u201cAt the end of the day he [Trump] still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d The administration is also reeling from bipartisan criticism of its decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria. On Sunday, secretary of state Mike Pompeo sought to defend a fragile and brief ceasefire brokered with Turkey, which he described as \u201cthe outcome that President Trump sent us to achieve\u201d. The US and Turkey reached an agreement on Thursday to halt Turkish operations against Kurdish forces for five days to allow military and civilians to evacuate an area of land around the border about 20 miles deep, before the territory is claimed by Turkey. Both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement. Republicans and Democrats in Washington argue the deal has undermined US interests in the region and delivered a significant victory to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Pompeo, also at the centre of the Ukraine scandal, distanced himself from such criticisms during an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, when asked if the Turkish government had been handed everything it had asked for. \u201cI was there. It sure didn\u2019t feel that way when we were negotiating,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIt was a hard-fought negotiation. It began before the vice-president and I even arrived in Ankara.\u201d Trump chimed in on Twitter, quoting his defense secretary on how \u201cthe ceasefire is holding up very nicely\u201d. In his first version of the tweet, the president typed Mark Esper\u2019s name as Mark Esperanto. Later on Sunday he returned to the subject of impeachment, tweeting that the Ukraine whistleblower was a \u201cfraud, just like the Russia Hoax\u201d. Over the weekend, Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi led a bipartisan delegation to Jordan to discuss the fallout of Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal. \u201cOur bipartisan delegation is visiting Jordan at a critical time for the security and stability of the region,\u201d Pelosi\u2019s office said in a statement released on Saturday. \u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to Isis, Iran and Russia.\u201d Despite the chaos over US Syria policy, one of Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters in the Senate seemed to have abandoned his previously stringent criticism.

Researchers said that banning terms such as \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201clight\u201d was meant to dispel the myth that certain types of cigarette are less dangerous, but that by teaching customers colour codes linked to the old descriptions, \u201cmisperceptions are likely to endure\u201d.</p> <p>Another tactic used by the industry was to introduce flavour capsules previously reserved for the most expensive cigarettes into less costly products. The researchers said flavoured cigarettes were more likely to appeal to less regular smokers and young people.</p> <p>The Labour MP Alex Cunningham, who was one of the key proponents of plain packaging laws, said: \u201cNo one should be surprised at the tobacco companies doing everything possible to protect their brands, undermine the law and grow their sales. Ministers must act to put an end to this practice.</p> <p>\u201cIt is particularly worrying that they\u2019re now turning to new flavoured products \u2013 similar to vaping \u2013 which the university\u2019s research shows are proving to appeal more to non-smokers. This flies in the face of the legislation \u2013 [aimed at] a reduction of the number of smokers \u2013 and it is clear that we need to clamp down on tobacco companies who choose to circumvent the rules.\u201d</p> <p>The report\u2019s lead author, <a href=\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/karen-evans-reeves\">Dr Karen Evans-Reeves</a>, said the tobacco industry was \u201cengaged in activities that undermined and continue to undermine the legislation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMajor tobacco companies will always try to find a way to market their products,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the number of innovations we found in this study, we would encourage all governments considering implementing plain packaging legislation to consider how tobacco companies have adapted to the legislation in other countries and where possible, close any remaining loopholes.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Morris International, which owns Marlboro, did not respond to requests for comment. The Guardian previously revealed that the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/19/marlboro-tins-plain-packaging-tobacco-firm-philip-morris-cigarettes\">produced Marlboro-branded metal tins</a> in the run-up to the plain packaging legislation coming into force.

Researchers said that banning terms such as \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201clight\u201d was meant to dispel the myth that certain types of cigarette are less dangerous, but that by teaching customers colour codes linked to the old descriptions, \u201cmisperceptions are likely to endure\u201d. Another tactic used by the industry was to introduce flavour capsules previously reserved for the most expensive cigarettes into less costly products. The researchers said flavoured cigarettes were more likely to appeal to less regular smokers and young people. The Labour MP Alex Cunningham, who was one of the key proponents of plain packaging laws, said: \u201cNo one should be surprised at the tobacco companies doing everything possible to protect their brands, undermine the law and grow their sales. Ministers must act to put an end to this practice. \u201cIt is particularly worrying that they\u2019re now turning to new flavoured products \u2013 similar to vaping \u2013 which the university\u2019s research shows are proving to appeal more to non-smokers. This flies in the face of the legislation \u2013 [aimed at] a reduction of the number of smokers \u2013 and it is clear that we need to clamp down on tobacco companies who choose to circumvent the rules.\u201d The report\u2019s lead author, Dr Karen Evans-Reeves, said the tobacco industry was \u201cengaged in activities that undermined and continue to undermine the legislation\u201d. \u201cMajor tobacco companies will always try to find a way to market their products,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the number of innovations we found in this study, we would encourage all governments considering implementing plain packaging legislation to consider how tobacco companies have adapted to the legislation in other countries and where possible, close any remaining loopholes.\u201d Philip Morris International, which owns Marlboro, did not respond to requests for comment. The Guardian previously revealed that the company produced Marlboro-branded metal tins in the run-up to the plain packaging legislation coming into force. The move was criticised as a ploy to prolong the visibility of Marlboro\u2019s brand in the UK.",

      "body": "<p>By any objective measure, this had seemed like an away banker during a fevered buildup. Manchester United, mired in their worst start to a season since 1989-90, were goal-shy; their confidence seemingly in pieces. Liverpool were supposed to roll up to Old Trafford and extend their run of consecutive wins in the Premier League to a record-equalling 18th game.</p> \n<p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the eternally optimistic United manager, had claimed that \u201cthis is the perfect game for us\u201d but, to put it bluntly, nobody believed him. Perhaps they should have done.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/20/this-is-an-issue-we-have-to-discuss-klopp-hits-out-at-var-after-united-draw\">\u2018This is an issue we have to discuss\u2019: Klopp hits out at VAR after United draw</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was a wild turnaround from a United point of view, defying the form book, and it said everything that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team, having taken a first-half lead through Marcus Rashford, could finish disappointed at having failed to inflict upon Liverpool a first league defeat since January.</p> \n<p>United had begun with the bit between their teeth in a new 3-4-1-2 system and they fought as if affronted by all of the recent criticism. It was not a pretty game, United dragged Liverpool down from their lofty recent standards and with five minutes to go, the league leaders looked out of ideas. The story looked set to be coloured by United\u2019s bodies-on-the-line defiance.</p> \n<p>But Liverpool have not remained unbeaten for so long without knowing how to battle until the last and they were rewarded for their persistence, as much as anything else, when Andrew Robertson crossed low from the left. Roberto Firmino\u2019s presence in the middle seemed to distract the United defence and, rather abruptly, there was the substitute, Adam Lallana, all alone in front of goal, to sweep past David de Gea. What a moment it was for Lallana, whose Liverpool career has been blighted by injury. It was his first goal since he scored in a 3-0 Anfield win over Middlesbrough in May 2017 and it was the prompt for United\u2019s nerves to jangle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a406ba9b-b728-48ce-8688-0a4616b88241\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PzViiGcrONc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Liverpool had been poor in the first half and better in the second, but without creating too much of clear-cut note. Now they turned the screw. Another substitute, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fizzed a shot inches past a post and the five minutes of stoppage-time counted down slowly for United. Yet they did enough. For Solskj\u00e6r and his players, the performance as much as the result offered hope.</p> \n<p>United had started the day in 14th place \u2013 one point above the relegation zone \u2013 and it seemed as if every number, every statistic, was insulting them. Several bookmakers had them as long as 7-2 to beat opponents who Pep Guardiola had described as looking \u201cunstoppable\u201d.</p> \n<p>Liverpool had last dropped league points <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/03/everton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in the 0-0 draw at Everton on 3 March</a>. Desperate times called for radical measures and for the first time this season, Solskj\u00e6r started with a three-man defence, although even that plan needed a late fine-tune after Axel Tuanzebe was ruled out with an injury in the warm-up. In came Marcos Rojo on the left of the back three.</p> \n<p>Klopp made no attempt to hide his annoyance at what he felt were United\u2019s safety-first tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact when we come here \u2013 they just defend,\u201d he said afterwards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54c98c523457ddae60d3753f5d70c02fa3dea6d5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54c98c523457ddae60d3753f5d70c02fa3dea6d5/77_0_2845_1707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Rashford celebrates after putting Manchester United ahead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Rashford celebrates after putting Manchester United ahead.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was not a criticism, Klopp continued but, really, it was. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s idea was to hit his pacy forwards, Rashford and Daniel James, with balls into the channels but also for them to defend from the front; to set the tone for the team. They did so. This was arguably Rashford\u2019s best performance under Solskj\u00e6r while James\u2019s energy and remorselessness was a positive. United\u2019s collective commitment galvanised the Old Trafford crowd.</p> \n<p>It was a match where the nuances of VAR once again came under scrutiny and Klopp was bitterly unhappy that it did not rule out Rashford\u2019s goal. The flashpoint followed Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s tackle from behind on Divock Origi which set a fast United counterattack in motion and, certainly, it looked like a foul \u2013 even if Solskj\u00e6r disagreed. United still had some way to go but when Scott McTominay released James, there was pace and possibility. The Welshman crossed low and, after deceiving Jo\u00ebl Matip with a clever piece of movement inside the area, Rashford prodded past Alisson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/20/glazers-manchester-united-ed-woodward-football\">Glazers have no plans to sell Manchester United, says Ed Woodward</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Klopp\u2019s argument was that the referee Martin Atkinson had allowed the play to continue because he knew that VAR would help him after the event. But the problem was, in the Liverpool manager\u2019s view, that the decision was not then clear and obviously wrong enough to merit an overrule.</p> \n<p>Klopp\u2019s mood would darken before the interval when his team had an equaliser chalked off by VAR. On viewing the replay, it was plain that Sadio Man\u00e9 had used a hand to control a high ball before wriggling away from Lindel\u00f6f to beat De Gea. The problem with the technology is that it does not warn the supporters of the scoring team quickly enough. The Liverpool fans had erupted in delight then came back down to earth with a bump.</p> \n<p>Liverpool, who expect the absent Mohamed Salah to have recovered from his ankle problem for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game at Genk, had created the best chance of the first half when Man\u00e9 cut back for Firmino and he shot too close to De Gea, but Klopp was forced into changes in the second half.</p> \n<p>He effectively switched to a 4-2-4 in which Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lallana made a difference in wide areas, and the battle lines were drawn. United came to appear the likelier scorers of the next goal on the counter as Liverpool could not make inroads. Rashford fizzed a shot wide and James flickered. Liverpool, though, refused to lose.</p>",

      "bodyText": "By any objective measure, this had seemed like an away banker during a fevered buildup. Manchester United, mired in their worst start to a season since 1989-90, were goal-shy; their confidence seemingly in pieces. Liverpool were supposed to roll up to Old Trafford and extend their run of consecutive wins in the Premier League to a record-equalling 18th game. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the eternally optimistic United manager, had claimed that \u201cthis is the perfect game for us\u201d but, to put it bluntly, nobody believed him. Perhaps they should have done. It was a wild turnaround from a United point of view, defying the form book, and it said everything that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team, having taken a first-half lead through Marcus Rashford, could finish disappointed at having failed to inflict upon Liverpool a first league defeat since January. United had begun with the bit between their teeth in a new 3-4-1-2 system and they fought as if affronted by all of the recent criticism. It was not a pretty game, United dragged Liverpool down from their lofty recent standards and with five minutes to go, the league leaders looked out of ideas. The story looked set to be coloured by United\u2019s bodies-on-the-line defiance. But Liverpool have not remained unbeaten for so long without knowing how to battle until the last and they were rewarded for their persistence, as much as anything else, when Andrew Robertson crossed low from the left. Roberto Firmino\u2019s presence in the middle seemed to distract the United defence and, rather abruptly, there was the substitute, Adam Lallana, all alone in front of goal, to sweep past David de Gea. What a moment it was for Lallana, whose Liverpool career has been blighted by injury. It was his first goal since he scored in a 3-0 Anfield win over Middlesbrough in May 2017 and it was the prompt for United\u2019s nerves to jangle. Liverpool had been poor in the first half and better in the second, but without creating too much of clear-cut note. Now they turned the screw. Another substitute, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fizzed a shot inches past a post and the five minutes of stoppage-time counted down slowly for United. Yet they did enough. For Solskj\u00e6r and his players, the performance as much as the result offered hope. United had started the day in 14th place \u2013 one point above the relegation zone \u2013 and it seemed as if every number, every statistic, was insulting them. Several bookmakers had them as long as 7-2 to beat opponents who Pep Guardiola had described as looking \u201cunstoppable\u201d. Liverpool had last dropped league points in the 0-0 draw at Everton on 3 March. Desperate times called for radical measures and for the first time this season, Solskj\u00e6r started with a three-man defence, although even that plan needed a late fine-tune after Axel Tuanzebe was ruled out with an injury in the warm-up. In came Marcos Rojo on the left of the back three. Klopp made no attempt to hide his annoyance at what he felt were United\u2019s safety-first tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact when we come here \u2013 they just defend,\u201d he said afterwards. It was not a criticism, Klopp continued but, really, it was. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s idea was to hit his pacy forwards, Rashford and Daniel James, with balls into the channels but also for them to defend from the front; to set the tone for the team. They did so. This was arguably Rashford\u2019s best performance under Solskj\u00e6r while James\u2019s energy and remorselessness was a positive. United\u2019s collective commitment galvanised the Old Trafford crowd. It was a match where the nuances of VAR once again came under scrutiny and Klopp was bitterly unhappy that it did not rule out Rashford\u2019s goal. The flashpoint followed Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s tackle from behind on Divock Origi which set a fast United counterattack in motion and, certainly, it looked like a foul \u2013 even if Solskj\u00e6r disagreed. United still had some way to go but when Scott McTominay released James, there was pace and possibility. The Welshman crossed low and, after deceiving Jo\u00ebl Matip with a clever piece of movement inside the area, Rashford prodded past Alisson. Klopp\u2019s argument was that the referee Martin Atkinson had allowed the play to continue because he knew that VAR would help him after the event. But the problem was, in the Liverpool manager\u2019s view, that the decision was not then clear and obviously wrong enough to merit an overrule. Klopp\u2019s mood would darken before the interval when his team had an equaliser chalked off by VAR. On viewing the replay, it was plain that Sadio Man\u00e9 had used a hand to control a high ball before wriggling away from Lindel\u00f6f to beat De Gea. The problem with the technology is that it does not warn the supporters of the scoring team quickly enough. The Liverpool fans had erupted in delight then came back down to earth with a bump. Liverpool, who expect the absent Mohamed Salah to have recovered from his ankle problem for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game at Genk, had created the best chance of the first half when Man\u00e9 cut back for Firmino and he shot too close to De Gea, but Klopp was forced into changes in the second half. He effectively switched to a 4-2-4 in which Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lallana made a difference in wide areas, and the battle lines were drawn. United came to appear the likelier scorers of the next goal on the counter as Liverpool could not make inroads. Rashford fizzed a shot wide and James flickered. Liverpool, though, refused to lose.",

I think that there is a large segment of the population that is not represented in the top candidates on either side of the aisle, and that\u2019s something I think about.\u201d Amash is running for re-election as an independent but he told NBC he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say 100% of anything\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m running for Congress,\u201d he added, when asked about the possibility of being the Libertarian candidate for the White House, \u201cbut I keep things open and I wouldn\u2019t rule anything out\u201d. In the 2016 election, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson won 4,489,221 votes, 3.28% of ballots cast. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the popular vote by nearly 3m but Trump won the presidency in the electoral college. Amash is a libertarian-tinged founder member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus who drifted away from its support for Trump. He first called for impeachment \u2013 and was attacked by Trump in return \u2013 earlier this year, over the president\u2019s behaviour in relation to Russian election interference and the investigation into links between Trump and Moscow led by special counsel Robert Mueller. The current impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals. Earlier this month, Amash told the Hill: \u201cAssuming the articles are drafted properly, yeah, I think there\u2019s impeachable conduct that could be included in articles that I would support.\u201d Amash\u2019s former Republican colleagues are under increasing pressure. On Friday, Francis Rooney of Florida indicated that he could support impeachment if it comes to a vote on whether to send Trump to the Senate for trial. On Saturday, Rooney told Fox News he had decided to retire, becoming the 14th Republican to decide to leave the House in 2020. On Sunday he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union he had not made up his mind about impeachment. He also said he did not know if he still called himself a Republican, and added: \u201cWe only have one thing in our life, and that\u2019s our reputation \u2026 And so I\u2019m not going to ruin mine over anything, much less politics.\u201d",

No one is asking them to stop Brexit \u2013 merely to pause its headlong progress until a path can be found to ask the electorate whether or not they really want to live in a nation committed to the re-enactment of an imaginary past. Rob Sykes Oxford \u2022 Melanie Onn believes she should \u201cget back to helping \u2026 constituents\u201d by voting for the deal. As a Labour party member and one of her constituents I am saddened and angry and believe she is wrong. Owen Jones (Journal, 17 October) and Gordon Brown (Journal, 18 October) gave more than enough reasons for her to vote against the deal. As Keir Starmer told Andrew Marr on BBC1 on Sunday, \u201cYou cannot trust this government.\u201d At a time when Labour has the most exciting policies since 1945, she needs to do the right thing and vote against the deal. Martin Pask Grimsby, Lincolnshire \u2022 In the Saturday sitting of the House of Commons, it was shocking and horrifying how frequently those in favour of Brexit but not in favour of another referendum invoked the idea of what the people of the UK want. This is sheer hypocrisy. All ministers who have any real interest in the current view of the nation as a whole should obviously back a second referendum. Impressionistic ideas of what \u201cmy constituents\u201d might think, or extrapolations from the 2016 referendum, will simply not do. Our name should not be taken in vain, and it is particularly offensive for this to happen allegedly in the name of \u201cdemocracy\u201d. The most recent indication of what the people want was the petition to revoke article 50. Simon Brodbeck Cardiff \u2022 According to a report in Sunday\u2019s Observer, a recent Opinium poll shows only 42% of voters want a second referendum while 43% oppose it. So that\u2019s another expression of democratic opinion the remainers will have to disregard. Christopher Clayton Waverton, Cheshire \u2022 Yet again our incompetent prime minister has lost a key vote and now, in an act of breathtaking hypocrisy, is attempting to frustrate the will of parliament by accompanying his unsigned letter to Brussels requesting a Brexit extension with a second letter, signed by him, saying that he believes a delay would be a mistake. This surely constitutes a clear case of contempt of parliament. Dr Chris Newall Ealing, London \u2022 With his three letters ploy, Boris has just shot himself in the foot, possibly both feet, by proving to the EU leaders that he cannot be trusted with regard to anything he says. Chris Burrell Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire \u2022 I can\u2019t help but notice that the prime minister, for all his expensive education and patrician manner, has added to our national humiliation by introducing an unnecessary and incorrect apostrophe into the penultimate sentence of the penultimate paragraph of the letter that he signed, where he refers to \u201cour long history as neighbours and friends in this continent our people\u2019s [sic] share\u201d, turning a simple plural into a possessive. I can only hope that the EU leaders will come to the conclusion that this second letter, so illiterately expressed, must be a hoax and dismiss it out of hand.

He will now head home to prepare for the birth of a third child. \u201cThis is one of the biggest wins I\u2019ve had, after everything,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the win and I\u2019ve enjoyed my time here. \u201cI\u2019ll have three kids under four years old. I need to get on the road so we don\u2019t get out of control. I\u2019m excited for the third kid. My wife\u2019s been a huge support for getting me back on the court and making me fight to keep playing.\u201d",

The supreme court\u2019s imprisonment last Monday of nine separatist leaders for sedition over their roles in the failed bid for Catalan independence two years ago prompted violent unrest that left two people in a critical condition, hundreds more injured and cost more than \u20ac2m (\u00a31.7m).

      "body": "<p>There was a time when it was unusual for a season to pass in a British opera house without the complete Ring being performed. The first Ring cycle to be mounted in postwar Britain was premiered in 1949 at Covent Garden. Thereafter (with the sole exception of 1952), the Ring, or parts of it, was an annual fixture at the Royal Opera House for two decades. Finally there was a fallow year in 1969. By this time, however, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/29/archives/goodalls-ring-cycle-is-a-london-hit.html\">Sadler\u2019s Wells Opera</a> (later English National Opera) was building its own cycle, sung in English. The Ring \u2013 or parts thereof \u2013 continued to be performed most seasons into the 1980s at both houses, with Welsh National Opera and Scottish Opera also mounting Rings and - just as significantly - touring them around Britain.</p> <p>Little of this period of plenty remains today. This is not to downplay some important recent Ring cycles, such as those put on by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/13/watch-act-one-of-die-walkure-from-opera-north-ring-cycle-wagner\"> Opera North </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/24/der-ring-des-nibelungen-review\">Longborough festival</a>, or the concert performances at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/29/prom-20-gotterdammerung-barenboim-review\">the Proms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/04/siegfried-review-mark-elder-halle-bridgewater-hall-manchester-wagnerian\">elsewhere</a>, let alone the cycle directed by Keith Warner for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/11/classicalmusicandopera1\">Covent Garden</a> in 2007 and revived in 2012 and 2018. But the gaps are increasingly large and obvious. Though there are many different causes for this change, the steady decline in Britain\u2019s public subsidy to the opera sector is certainly one of the most decisive in making Wagner\u2019s opera cycle an increasing and sometimes very expensive rarity on our stages. The result is that younger newcomers to the Ring are no longer able to get access to this most important and ambitious of 19th century European musical art works.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"884605c15e6070d9b0113d95923496d997919500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/884605c15e6070d9b0113d95923496d997919500/0_77_4272_2563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The finest Wagner conductor of the modern era\u2019 - Daniel Barenboim conducts the Berlin Staatskapelle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The finest Wagner conductor of the modern era\u2019 - Daniel Barenboim conducts the Berlin Staatskapelle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hiroyuki Ito/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, if you are British and want to see a Ring cycle, you must travel abroad.

Now 76, Barenboim has been conducting Guy Cassiers\u2019 production since 2010, both in Berlin and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/italy-arts-protests-riots-scala\">Milan</a> (several in those casts there took part in Barenboim\u2019s 2013 Proms cycle).

Infrastructure Australia recently warned $600bn in new spending was needed over the next 15 years to ensure the nation\u2019s infrastructure kept pace with its growth. In the last budget, the Morrison government announced $100bn would be spent on infrastructure, a figure McCormack has taken to trumpeting, without the caveat the spending is over a decade, with less than half to be spent over the next four years. Treasurers from across the nation recently met with Josh Frydenberg in a bid to have infrastructure spending fast tracked, as the states and territories hunt for ways to stimulate their economies. Frydenberg has called on the states to bring forward lower tier infrastructure projects, in the context of \u2018boosting productivity\u2019 in the face of a slowing national and world economy.",

The Turkish defence ministry said a convoy of 86 vehicles left the city on Sunday afternoon carrying fighters from the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Front (SDF) and wounded civilians south to cities beyond the 20-mile buffer zone that Turkey is seeking to clear along its border with Syria. Kino Gabriel, an SDF spokesman, confirmed Ras al-Ayn had been abandoned as part of a five-day, US-brokered ceasefire with Turkey, in place since Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any more fighters in the city,\u201d he said. Fighters remain deployed in other areas inside the buffer zone including the cities Kobane and al-Darbasiyah, Kurdish activists said. Hostilities in the 11-day-old campaign were paused last week to allow Kurdish fighters to safely retreat from the border area following talks in Ankara between the US vice-president Mike Pence and the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Turkey and the Kurds have both accused each other of violating the temporary truce. Erdo\u011fan said on Saturday that his country would \u201ccrush the heads\u201d of Kurdish militants if they did not withdraw in time. He said he would discuss the deployment of Syrian government forces in the safe zone during talks with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, next week, but warned Ankara would \u201cimplement its own plans\u201d if a solution was not reached. Trump has faced rare bipartisan criticism in the US for his surprise announcement this month that American troops would stand aside as Turkey mounted an operation to push US-backed Kurdish forces in Syria, its allies in the fight against Isis, at least 20 miles (32km) away from its southern border. The US withdrawal, which led the Kurds to turn to Moscow to broker an agreement with the Syrian regime to protect them against the Turkish onslaught, has been described by Congress\u2019s most senior Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, as \u201ca grave mistake\u201d. Former CIA director and retired US military general David Petraeus said on Sunday that the US had abandoned its Kurdish allies. \u201cThey took over 10,000 losses as the defeat of Islamic State was carried out, the elimination of the caliphate that Isis had,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThis is a very sudden exit.

Pelosi and other senior Democrats walked out of an acrimonious meeting with Trump over the issue last week and accused the president of having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d. It is \u201ca critical time for the security and stability of the region\u201d, Pelosi said in a statement from Amman. \u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees and the dangerous opening that has been provided to Isis, Iran and Russia,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, US troops were seen on Sunday leaving a key base in northern Syria with their equipment, apparently part of a broad US withdrawal ordered by Trump. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who had accompanied Pence to Turkey, said on Sunday he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the ceasefire. \u201cThere\u2019s relatively little fighting, a little sporadic small-arms fire, a mortar or two,\u201d he told ABC. Erdo\u011fan unleashed the offensive against the Kurds on 9 October, agreeing to a pause after Pence and Pompeo rushed to Turkey amid mounting international outrage. The Turkish defence ministry said on Sunday that one Turkish soldier was killed in an attack by Kurdish fighters in the Tal Abyad border area. The Kurdish Red Crescent, a humanitarian group unaffiliated with the International Committee of the Red Cross, said 20 civilians had died and another 20 had been injured in attacks by Turkey or its allies since the start of the ceasefire. Pelosi\u2019s unscheduled visit was in keeping with several overseas delegations led by the House that have highlighted gaps between the Trump administration\u2019s position and those held by Congress, including by many Republicans. In April she visited the Irish border to warn about the risk of a hard Brexit threatening the Good Friday agreement, which the US helped to broker in 1998. Trump administration officials have said they would \u201centhusiastically\u201d back Britain leaving the EU without a deal. Pelosi and other congressional leaders attended the Munich security conference in February, delivering reassuring messages to some of the European leaders whom Trump has accused of failing to contribute their share to Nato and the US-led campaign against Isis. Pilots from Jordan took part in airstrikes as part of the US-led coalition against Isis, a role that became prominent after the capture and filmed murder of a Jordanian air force lieutenant, Muath al-Kasasbeh, by Isis militants. There are thought to be up to 2,000 Jordanian members of Isis held in makeshift prisons across north-east Syria. The US continues to deploy troops at the al-Tanf base on the Syrian border with Jordan. A report by Petra News, Jordan\u2019s state-run news agency, said the king \u201cstressed the need to reach a political solution to the crisis that preserves the unity of Syria and its people and guarantees the voluntary and safe return of refugees\u201d.",

Johnston, an invalid by his early 50s, died a year later at 58.</p> <p>I\u2019m always gripped by an acute sadness when I read the Meredith trilogy, especially Clean Straw, mainly because of how much more these writers might have achieved had they lived on. The third book in the trilogy, Johnston\u2019s unfinished Cartload of Clay, in which the invalid Meredith casts his eye over the Australia of the late 1960s through his front window and from the leafy streets of Mosman, is the most melancholy.</p> <p>Despite his illness, Johnston was, with the first two at any rate, at the top of his literary game. </p> <p>On the fictional island, visiting Australians would seek the Merediths out, curiosities for their determination to leave Australia behind. Those Australian visitors would be unmistakable as they\u2019d get off the ferry at the port: \u201c \u2026 they would wear Digger-type slouch hats and carry knapsacks sewn all over with the blatant symbols of an aggressive chauvinism, Australian flags and kangaroos and southern crosses and boomerangs or just the simple word AUSTRALIA \u2026\u201d.</p> <p>Meredith knew that they judged him as \u201cun-Australian\u201d for \u201cprecariously enduring discomfort when they were entitled to enjoy surfeits of comfort in the world\u2019s highest standard of living, and were being wilfully wayward parents in denying their children their birthright of life in God\u2019s own country\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Mosman, Meredith, perhaps like Johnston, was lost among his own people.</p> <p>\u201cI do not understand or know anything, really, of the customs of the people, my own compatriots, who live across the harbour in the western suburbs, or those to the north or the east or the south; they are far stranger to me, infinitely less comprehensible, than the Greeks were. I am sure that we really do not <em>want </em>to know each other, but who is to blame for this? Have I lost my sense of curiosity? Do I find them simply not interesting enough? Is it that I just resent their possession of a comfortable complacency that I have failed to find? Or scorn them for their conforming, unthinking anonymity? Perhaps they are the lucky people after all, the unthinking ones, taking it as it comes and not questioning it.\u201d</p> <p>I also love Clean Straw for its wry observations of the social and sexual mores of the late 1960s Australian progressive class. He depicts the men, with their long hair and sideburns and soft-collared jackets, upwardly mobile and opposing the Vietnam War, excited by \u2013 but feeling the pressure of keeping up with \u2013 the increasingly liberated women of their orbit.</p> <p>Yes, Johnston was excellent at describing place from afar.</p> <p>But he never lost sight of what was in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cSydney is a city of light and wind more than architecture, and in the pale shimmer of summer heat under the pulsing fierce light refracted from the vast harbour in the centre, or when smoke and dust drifted like Pompeiian ash before the gasping hot breath of the westerlies, the surroundings were like some gigantic incurable wound still weeping through the spread gauze between the ugly dryness of the scar tissue,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThe majesties of nature and the monstrosities of man have a cheek by jowl evidence in Sydney more insistent, I think, than in any other city in the world, but few seem to perceive, or at any rate to be worried about, the enormity of our offences.\u201d</p> <p>Fifty years later, the Sydney Johnston describes in Clean Straw for Nothing was never more mine.</p> <p>That\u2019s special.<br></p> <p><br></p>",

It was the second novel in Johnston\u2019s semi-autobiographical \u201cMeredith trilogy\u201d \u2013 chronicling the progress of David Meredith from a childhood in dreary Melbourne suburbia to gun reporter to disenchanted expatriate novelist \u2013 but it is so much more than that. It is a potent Australian story of obsessive love and the impulse to escape conformity and create. It\u2019s also about the destructive, self-fulfilling power of jealousy, and how pursuit of the idyllic can set its own unforeseen traps. It\u2019s never didactic.

For in the second novel Johnston evokes island life, with all of its natural beauty and challenges, its counter-cultural sexual and social follies, from Mosman, Sydney, to which he and the family retreated in 1964, the year My Brother Jack won the Miles.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After Johnston, Clift and their two children moved to Hydra (their youngest was born there), a group of expatriate Europeans, Americans and Canadians \u2013 including Leonard Cohen and Marianne Ihlen \u2013 coalesced around them.

It is hope and despair, and magical experiences that become soiled and smutty, and delicacies that jar, and murderous attacks delivered with the gentlest of touches,\u201d Johnston, channeling Meredith, writes. At its core though, Clean Straw is a novel exploring literary expatriatism \u2013 about the burning impulse to flee a postwar Australia (especially Melbourne) that was stultifying, grey and imposingly conservative. The postwar London where the Merediths, like Johnston and Clift, landed, was little more promising \u2013 oppressive and characterised by a stiff-upper-lip \u201cmustn\u2019t complain\u201d austerity. The newspaper work was, for Johnston and Meredith, unsatisfying, vacuous and intellectually shallow \u2013 and most of all an impediment to creative ambition. Mirroring the experience of Johnston and Clift and their children, the Merediths go for an extreme version of \u201cover there\u201d. While a gaggle of Australians \u2013 Greer, James, Humphries \u2013 would later head to London, the Johnston-Clifts had already spent a decade on Hydra, an idyll and a cage they left barely intact, physically and emotionally. Johnston left with his Miles Franklin-winning novels (one written, the other in gestation), while Clift returned to Australia as a novelist (of arguably larger talent, though in Johnston\u2019s shadow) and as a newspaper columnist of great emotional range and writerly elegance. Both had aged beyond their years. Hard living and island austerity, all of those \u201cmurderous attacks delivered with the gentlest of touches\u201d within their marriage, proved fatal and, sadly, coincidental to their late success. Clift died of an overdose at 45 in 1969, just as Clean Straw was about to be published, the laying bare of Meredith\u2019s marriage to Cressida Morley a thinly disguised take on (his version of) their own, its final acts playing out bleakly on the lower north shore.

Back in Mosman, Meredith, perhaps like Johnston, was lost among his own people. \u201cI do not understand or know anything, really, of the customs of the people, my own compatriots, who live across the harbour in the western suburbs, or those to the north or the east or the south; they are far stranger to me, infinitely less comprehensible, than the Greeks were. I am sure that we really do not want to know each other, but who is to blame for this? Have I lost my sense of curiosity? Do I find them simply not interesting enough? Is it that I just resent their possession of a comfortable complacency that I have failed to find? Or scorn them for their conforming, unthinking anonymity? Perhaps they are the lucky people after all, the unthinking ones, taking it as it comes and not questioning it.\u201d I also love Clean Straw for its wry observations of the social and sexual mores of the late 1960s Australian progressive class. He depicts the men, with their long hair and sideburns and soft-collared jackets, upwardly mobile and opposing the Vietnam War, excited by \u2013 but feeling the pressure of keeping up with \u2013 the increasingly liberated women of their orbit. Yes, Johnston was excellent at describing place from afar. But he never lost sight of what was in front of him. \u201cSydney is a city of light and wind more than architecture, and in the pale shimmer of summer heat under the pulsing fierce light refracted from the vast harbour in the centre, or when smoke and dust drifted like Pompeiian ash before the gasping hot breath of the westerlies, the surroundings were like some gigantic incurable wound still weeping through the spread gauze between the ugly dryness of the scar tissue,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe majesties of nature and the monstrosities of man have a cheek by jowl evidence in Sydney more insistent, I think, than in any other city in the world, but few seem to perceive, or at any rate to be worried about, the enormity of our offences.\u201d Fifty years later, the Sydney Johnston describes in Clean Straw for Nothing was never more mine. That\u2019s special.",

Add to this the interference of byes \u2013 three points for either Newcastle or Brisbane could have them third, instead of sixth and seventh \u2013 and there\u2019s a refreshing intrigue to this season already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/var-stalemate-underscores-absurdity-of-offside-overreach\">VAR stalemate underscores absurdity of offside overreach | Dean Biron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which brings us to Melbourne Victory, and a tale of two 2-1s.</p> <p>Much has been made of what a Kevin Muscat-less Victory might look like in 2019-20. Inaugural captain for six seasons, assistant or head coach ever since, his combative and at times fractious personality has loomed over this club since its inception.</p> <p>No shrinking violet himself, Marco Kurz is not a Jim Magilton coming in cold \u2013 he has learned the league\u2019s idiosyncrasies and studied its personnel during two impressive seasons with Adelaide United. And yet the signs of \u201cadjustment pains\u201d are already there to be seen.</p> <p>Overly cautious and lacking a front-third cutting edge, Victory\u2019s opening round derby draw was a cautionary reminder for Kurz \u2013 at Adelaide he could be the hunter, at Victory he\u2019ll be the hunted. It\u2019s one thing to set a side up to be defensively resolute and then look to hit in transition, it\u2019s another to take a game by the scruff of its neck: dictate play, control tempo and midfield, and unpick set defences.</p> <p>In Marcus Babbel in round two, Kurz came up against another defensive-minded coach \u2013 and one who almost paid the price for an overly unambitious set-up himself in round one against the unfortunate Mariners. But in round two it was Babbel who seized the initiative.</p> <p>Switching from his opening round 5-3-2 to a 4-3-3, Babbel pushed Keanu Baccus higher in midfield to press, alongside Nick Sullivan, onto the two holders of Victory\u2019s 4-2-3-1 system. It was a small change, but one that had significant ramifications for the outcome of the game. With two bodies higher and closer to Melbourne\u2019s box opportunities began to favour them \u2013 that Baccus\u2019s 25m strike and goal was of the highest quality may have been unexpected. That he was in a position to do so in the first place, was not. For Kurz, simply put, when you\u2019re the coach of Melbourne Victory opponents aren\u2019t allowed to come to your back yard and be allowed to play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"130b8e4983999e39aa09d3cc5588fa2a59d44d7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/130b8e4983999e39aa09d3cc5588fa2a59d44d7f/0_90_2661_1597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Kurz, Melbourne Victory head coach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Kurz is a quality coach, but needs to get his side clicking sooner rather than later.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another engaging 2-1 was played out at Sydney\u2019s Leichhardt Oval, but this time the winners were not perhaps the more deserving side. \u201cOn paper, it looks like a serene start to their title defence, but boy were they made to work for it,\u201d match commentator Simon Hill summarised.</p> <p>For large parts of the second half, hosts Sydney FC were second best against an impressive Wellington Phoenix, whose coach Ufuk Talay, as a former assistant with the champions, was bound to know the tactical thinking of head coach Steve Corica and his key players intimately.</p> <p>A deflected first goal and an unlikely and almost equally fortuitous looping second from Rhyan Grant were enough though. \u201cFootball can be cruel,\u201d rejoined Hill.</p> <p>And yet there was a sense of inevitability surrounding Sydney\u2019s win \u2013 the opener was earned off the back of near-total dominance early on \u2013 an inevitability made more stark when seen in contrast to the apparent surety that Victory would <em>fail </em>to win.</p> <p>The adage goes that champion sides can win when they\u2019re playing poorly. But it\u2019s a non-scientific acknowledgement of intangibles like self-belief, cohesion and team culture. A picture of stability and continuity over past seasons, if Corica stood in the shadow of his predecessor Graham Arnold last season, there\u2019s no question that this is a Corica team now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/13/a-league-return-its-own-best-advert-as-new-teenage-crop-emerges\">Emergence of new teenage crop best advert for returning A-League | Richard Parkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like pets that resemble their owner, FC in 2019-20 are quiet, hardworking, quick-thinking and slick. Setting out their stall in the opening minutes the crisp, one-touch ball movement between Alex Baumjohann, Grant and Adam Le Fondre was exquisite. Sydney\u2019s is a mobile front four, all of whom can create or finish \u2013 if Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107 has a quiet game the threat will come from elsewhere. They may have uncharacteristically invited Wellington back into the contest later on, but this was a 2-1 win anchored in the cohesion, character and culture of the team.</p> <p>With a raft of new personnel, Victory under Kurz will take some time to gel. Jakob Poulsen looks a recruit of the highest calibre, the talent of Andrew Nabbout and a fit-again Robbie Kruse is well-known. But the balance of the squad has shifted more defensively \u2013 like Sydney, in the image of their new coach.</p> <p>Keisuke Honda is not a man you replace easily. James Troisi is a creator, and perhaps more than either of these, Terry Antonis is that rare A-League unicorn, a midfielder who can work tirelessly both in defence and attack, and still constitute a considerable final-third threat.</p> <p>The brief outings of Migjen Basha suggest he\u2019s a capable deep-lying playmaker, while Kristijan Dobras has a weight of expectation upon him already, as a seeming three-in-one replacement for Honda, Troisi or Antonis.</p> <p>Lacking Sydney\u2019s cohesion, the results won\u2019t just drop for Victory. And until they support Ola Toivonen to the level he\u2019s accustomed, they\u2019re a team there for the taking.

      "bodyText": "Two Sydney, two Melbourne teams and the reigning premiers Perth \u2013 after just two rounds it\u2019s already shaping as an A-League top six that many would have predicted pre-season; except one club is missing. With last season\u2019s bottom sides showing significant improvement, it\u2019s a close competition. There have been no 4-0, 5-0 drubbings, and the league\u2019s nominal 10h and 11th-placed teams have put in excellent performances, albeit without fortune or reward. Add to this the interference of byes \u2013 three points for either Newcastle or Brisbane could have them third, instead of sixth and seventh \u2013 and there\u2019s a refreshing intrigue to this season already. Which brings us to Melbourne Victory, and a tale of two 2-1s. Much has been made of what a Kevin Muscat-less Victory might look like in 2019-20. Inaugural captain for six seasons, assistant or head coach ever since, his combative and at times fractious personality has loomed over this club since its inception. No shrinking violet himself, Marco Kurz is not a Jim Magilton coming in cold \u2013 he has learned the league\u2019s idiosyncrasies and studied its personnel during two impressive seasons with Adelaide United. And yet the signs of \u201cadjustment pains\u201d are already there to be seen. Overly cautious and lacking a front-third cutting edge, Victory\u2019s opening round derby draw was a cautionary reminder for Kurz \u2013 at Adelaide he could be the hunter, at Victory he\u2019ll be the hunted. It\u2019s one thing to set a side up to be defensively resolute and then look to hit in transition, it\u2019s another to take a game by the scruff of its neck: dictate play, control tempo and midfield, and unpick set defences. In Marcus Babbel in round two, Kurz came up against another defensive-minded coach \u2013 and one who almost paid the price for an overly unambitious set-up himself in round one against the unfortunate Mariners. But in round two it was Babbel who seized the initiative. Switching from his opening round 5-3-2 to a 4-3-3, Babbel pushed Keanu Baccus higher in midfield to press, alongside Nick Sullivan, onto the two holders of Victory\u2019s 4-2-3-1 system. It was a small change, but one that had significant ramifications for the outcome of the game. With two bodies higher and closer to Melbourne\u2019s box opportunities began to favour them \u2013 that Baccus\u2019s 25m strike and goal was of the highest quality may have been unexpected. That he was in a position to do so in the first place, was not. For Kurz, simply put, when you\u2019re the coach of Melbourne Victory opponents aren\u2019t allowed to come to your back yard and be allowed to play. Another engaging 2-1 was played out at Sydney\u2019s Leichhardt Oval, but this time the winners were not perhaps the more deserving side. \u201cOn paper, it looks like a serene start to their title defence, but boy were they made to work for it,\u201d match commentator Simon Hill summarised. For large parts of the second half, hosts Sydney FC were second best against an impressive Wellington Phoenix, whose coach Ufuk Talay, as a former assistant with the champions, was bound to know the tactical thinking of head coach Steve Corica and his key players intimately. A deflected first goal and an unlikely and almost equally fortuitous looping second from Rhyan Grant were enough though. \u201cFootball can be cruel,\u201d rejoined Hill. And yet there was a sense of inevitability surrounding Sydney\u2019s win \u2013 the opener was earned off the back of near-total dominance early on \u2013 an inevitability made more stark when seen in contrast to the apparent surety that Victory would fail to win. The adage goes that champion sides can win when they\u2019re playing poorly. But it\u2019s a non-scientific acknowledgement of intangibles like self-belief, cohesion and team culture. A picture of stability and continuity over past seasons, if Corica stood in the shadow of his predecessor Graham Arnold last season, there\u2019s no question that this is a Corica team now. Like pets that resemble their owner, FC in 2019-20 are quiet, hardworking, quick-thinking and slick. Setting out their stall in the opening minutes the crisp, one-touch ball movement between Alex Baumjohann, Grant and Adam Le Fondre was exquisite. Sydney\u2019s is a mobile front four, all of whom can create or finish \u2013 if Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107 has a quiet game the threat will come from elsewhere. They may have uncharacteristically invited Wellington back into the contest later on, but this was a 2-1 win anchored in the cohesion, character and culture of the team. With a raft of new personnel, Victory under Kurz will take some time to gel. Jakob Poulsen looks a recruit of the highest calibre, the talent of Andrew Nabbout and a fit-again Robbie Kruse is well-known. But the balance of the squad has shifted more defensively \u2013 like Sydney, in the image of their new coach. Keisuke Honda is not a man you replace easily. James Troisi is a creator, and perhaps more than either of these, Terry Antonis is that rare A-League unicorn, a midfielder who can work tirelessly both in defence and attack, and still constitute a considerable final-third threat. The brief outings of Migjen Basha suggest he\u2019s a capable deep-lying playmaker, while Kristijan Dobras has a weight of expectation upon him already, as a seeming three-in-one replacement for Honda, Troisi or Antonis. Lacking Sydney\u2019s cohesion, the results won\u2019t just drop for Victory. And until they support Ola Toivonen to the level he\u2019s accustomed, they\u2019re a team there for the taking. Which is great news for a more even league, plus one additional team, all raring to make a top-six spot a reward, not a birthright.",

To the surprise of visitors on Sunday afternoon, activists from Extinction Rebellion wearing just underwear suddenly assumed the foetal position while others poured the \u201coil\u201d on their bodies in the Ondaatje Wing main hall, where a collection of pieces sponsored by BP is on display. The protest performance piece, titled Crude Truth, was to mark the end of the BP Portrait Award exhibition. After a monologue by clothed protester Eden, 19, calling on arts organisations to sever ties with companies \u201cfunding extinction\u201d, one activist led a brief chant of \u201cNPG, drop BP\u201d. \u201cWho will there be left to see, who will there be left to paint, if we have no earth and no people?\u201d recited Eden. \u201cWe cannot be artists on a dead planet.

Absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said the 75-year-old, who set up his own engineering firm after his father forbade his son following him down the mine. Davis, who voted remain \u201cto keep my children happy\u201d, would vote out now: \u201cIt would be an insult to me to run a second referendum. I believe strongly in democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Waiting for his children to finish swimming, Andrew Hampson, 42, said he too voted remain but thought the UK should now probably leave the EU. A former advertising executive who swapped his City job to move to Yorkshire and become a cabinet maker, he thought the remain lobby were still scaremongering. \u201cIt\u2019s like with the Y2k crisis,\u201d he said, referring to the experts who warned that a computer bug was projected to create havoc at the beginning of the year 2000. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Yet he questioned exactly what Boris Johnson\u2019s deal really meant: \u201cI think he\u2019s left it purposefully vague. I do worry what Boris has agreed and I think it\u2019s nowhere near what a lot of people wanted.\u201d Many people wanted a real change in immigration policy, he said, particularly in the former coalfields in the north of England: \u201cI know plenty of liberal Guardian readers who will disagree, but the only reason for having immigration is to keep labour costs down. Working people get castigated for saying that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f276e9fc2a2524bf49da63c4369bfba735d5e8b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f276e9fc2a2524bf49da63c4369bfba735d5e8b9/0_345_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plasterer Martin Lawton at Denaby Main in South Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plasterer Martin Lawton at Denaby Main in South Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Lord Conyers pub in neighbouring Conisbrough, 32-year-old plasterer Martin Lawton said he voted leave, partly to regain border control. \u201cIt seems to have been quite easy for people to come in illegally and legally. It should be stricter,\u201d he said, saying that he charges \u00a315 an hour but had been undercut by eastern Europeans happy to work for the minimum wage.</p> <p>Though she campaigned for remain in the referendum, Flint has become increasingly outspoken against the EU. \u201cWhen it comes to workers\u2019 rights, the EU isn\u2019t God,\u201d she told the Commons on Saturday. \u201cThe fact is local authorities up and down the UK have to outsource contracts to the European Union at the detriment of workers in their local communities. We have seen a rise of zero-hours contracts and poor conditions partly because of that outsourcing.\u201d</p> <p>Badmouthing the EU is unlikely to lose her many votes. A petition to deselect Flint gained just 178 signatures and she was reselected by her constituency party last week. But her seat is not safe: her majority fell to 5,169 at the last election, down from 14,659 when she was first elected in the 1997 Tony Blair landslide. And in the 2019 European elections, the Brexit party topped the poll in Doncaster with 30,016 votes, with Labour a distant second on 11,393.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"343ab4499210cad51fa8a869ba349466db136d43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/343ab4499210cad51fa8a869ba349466db136d43/0_106_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Rufus of the Stars in Our Eyes charity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Rufus of the Stars in Our Eyes charity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Flint cannot count on the support of all leave voters in her constituency. Colin Rufus, who helps run Stars in Our Eyes, a charity that puts on talent shows, said he would now vote remain: \u201cWe were lied to. I voted on the understanding that however many millions each week would go to the NHS. And no one told me there would be a border in Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>Flint should be campaigning for another referendum, he insisted. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, she voted against what Labour people want. We want another go at it.\u201d</p>",

She has listened to her constituents, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said the 75-year-old, who set up his own engineering firm after his father forbade his son following him down the mine. Davis, who voted remain \u201cto keep my children happy\u201d, would vote out now: \u201cIt would be an insult to me to run a second referendum. I believe strongly in democracy.\u201d Waiting for his children to finish swimming, Andrew Hampson, 42, said he too voted remain but thought the UK should now probably leave the EU. A former advertising executive who swapped his City job to move to Yorkshire and become a cabinet maker, he thought the remain lobby were still scaremongering. \u201cIt\u2019s like with the Y2k crisis,\u201d he said, referring to the experts who warned that a computer bug was projected to create havoc at the beginning of the year 2000. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u201d Yet he questioned exactly what Boris Johnson\u2019s deal really meant: \u201cI think he\u2019s left it purposefully vague. I do worry what Boris has agreed and I think it\u2019s nowhere near what a lot of people wanted.\u201d Many people wanted a real change in immigration policy, he said, particularly in the former coalfields in the north of England: \u201cI know plenty of liberal Guardian readers who will disagree, but the only reason for having immigration is to keep labour costs down. Working people get castigated for saying that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d At the Lord Conyers pub in neighbouring Conisbrough, 32-year-old plasterer Martin Lawton said he voted leave, partly to regain border control. \u201cIt seems to have been quite easy for people to come in illegally and legally. It should be stricter,\u201d he said, saying that he charges \u00a315 an hour but had been undercut by eastern Europeans happy to work for the minimum wage. Though she campaigned for remain in the referendum, Flint has become increasingly outspoken against the EU. \u201cWhen it comes to workers\u2019 rights, the EU isn\u2019t God,\u201d she told the Commons on Saturday. \u201cThe fact is local authorities up and down the UK have to outsource contracts to the European Union at the detriment of workers in their local communities. We have seen a rise of zero-hours contracts and poor conditions partly because of that outsourcing.\u201d Badmouthing the EU is unlikely to lose her many votes. A petition to deselect Flint gained just 178 signatures and she was reselected by her constituency party last week. But her seat is not safe: her majority fell to 5,169 at the last election, down from 14,659 when she was first elected in the 1997 Tony Blair landslide. And in the 2019 European elections, the Brexit party topped the poll in Doncaster with 30,016 votes, with Labour a distant second on 11,393. But Flint cannot count on the support of all leave voters in her constituency. Colin Rufus, who helps run Stars in Our Eyes, a charity that puts on talent shows, said he would now vote remain: \u201cWe were lied to. I voted on the understanding that however many millions each week would go to the NHS. And no one told me there would be a border in Ireland.\u201d Flint should be campaigning for another referendum, he insisted. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, she voted against what Labour people want. We want another go at it.\u201d",

A further 12 companies were said to have lost sums ranging from more than \u00a36m down to \u00a390,000. In his defence documents, Bell denied wrongdoing and said he did not admit that his companies had suffered loss or damage because of his alleged actions. The confidentiality agreement surrounding the settlement means that it is not yet clear how much of the \u00a367m of claims Bell will end up paying, although some payments have begun to trickle in. Filings made at Companies House show that, so far, \u00a3273,517.41 has been received by EV Construction &amp; Management, plus a further \u00a3200,899.54 by Pavillion Management Services, two of six former Bell companies that launched legal claims against their former owner. One insolvency expert said: \u201cUltimately the liquidator will have to declare how much has been paid by statute. Probably, Paul Bell wants to defer public knowledge of what has been paid for some time.\u201d The financier has been investigated by the taxman for an alleged massive VAT fraud carried out through payroll companies that processed hundreds of millions of pounds in wages for legitimate businesses. While he was arrested in 2015, he has not been charged and he has previously \u201cvigorously denied any wrongdoing\u201d. HMRC and the Isle of Man police declined to comment. RSM said it could not provide details of the agreement. Bell did not respond to efforts to contact him directly or via his law firm, Hill Dickinson.",

The US president announced in a Saturday night tweet that he would seek an alternative venue to host world leaders next June. The move represented a rare admission of defeat by Trump, who typically digs in and fights to defend every controversial statement and policy. Though the initial floating of the idea in August prompted widespread expressions of concern, on Sunday Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said the president was \u201chonestly surprised at the level of pushback\u201d his decision generated this week. To an incredulous response from his interviewer, Mulvaney said Trump \u201cstill considers himself to be in the hospitality business\u201d. Even in his concession, Trump complained bitterly that he thought he was \u201cdoing something very good for our country\u201d by choosing the Trump National Doral, near Miami, to host G7 leaders. \u201cIt is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to Miami international airport, has tremendous ballrooms &amp; meeting rooms, and each delegation would have ... its own 50 to 70 unit building,\u201d he tweeted.

Thank you!\u201d The choice of Trump National Doral was widely condemned as the most egregious example yet of the president abusing his position to enrich himself and his business. The morning after the u-turn, Mulvaney sought to explain it on Fox News Sunday. \u201cThe president isn\u2019t one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was honestly surprised at the level of pushback. \u201cAt the end of the day he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world and he wanted to put on the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could and he was very comfortable doing that at Doral. \u2018\u2026 I think it\u2019s the right decision to change, we\u2019ll have to find some place else and my guess is we\u2019ll find someplace else that the media won\u2019t like either for some other reason.\u201d Pulled up on describing the president of the United States as still \u201cin the hospitality business\u201d, Mulvaney said: \u201cBut that\u2019s his background.

Trump\u2019s u-turn was welcomed by ethics watchdogs. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to award the G7 conference to his own property was outrageous, corrupt and a constitutional violation. \u201cIt was stunningly corrupt even for a stunningly corrupt administration. His reversal of that decision is a bow to reality, but does not change how astonishing it was that a president ever thought this was appropriate, or that it was something he could get away with.\u201d The outcome shows that pressure works, even on Trump, Bookbinder added. \u201cThe president deserves no plaudits for doing the right thing only after public outcry forced him not to do the wrong thing.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted: \u201cThe constitution is clear: the president cannot accept gifts or payments from foreign governments. No one is above the law.\u201d House judiciary committee chairman Jerrold Nadler described the move as \u201camong the most brazen examples yet of the president\u2019s corruption\u201d. The backlash came with Trump already facing an impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-led House and a backlash from Republicans over his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, abandoning Kurdish allies. A number of congressional investigations are also scrutinising Trump\u2019s finances and potential conflicts of interest stemming from his property business. The emoluments clause of the US constitution prohibits government officials from receiving salaries, fees or profits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval. Asked on Sunday if Trump understood that his Doral decision \u201clooked lousy\u201d, Mulvaney said: \u201cHe knows, he thinks that people think it looks lousy.\u201d But he insisted: \u201cCould we have put on an excellent G7 at Doral?

      "bodyText": "In the middle of the political storm over Brexit, last week\u2019s row between Labour and the Confederation of British Industry came as a distraction. While the big issue of the country\u2019s future trading relations with its biggest economic partner should have taken priority, the two sides were instead at loggerheads over nationalisation. The CBI was caught red-handed with a cheap political stunt when it claimed that Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans would cost an \u201ceye-watering\u201d \u00a3196bn. In a piece of analysis unbecoming of the nation\u2019s leading lobby group, it trumped up the figure by including spending plans that are not official Labour policy. The CBI included purchasing existing railway rolling stock, to the tune of \u00a314bn, even though it later admitted it knew this was wrong, in an email exchange with Labour that was later seen by the Guardian. So far Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general, has refused to apologise to the party and says she stands by the \u00a3196bn figure. To regain trust, she should concede a mistake has been made. Future interventions could be undermined by a lingering suspicion of the lobby group\u2019s methods. While the storm that raged between Britain\u2019s leading business lobby group and Her Majesty\u2019s official opposition was reminiscent of an unedifying he-said, she-said playground tiff, important questions were nonetheless raised. That the CBI felt the need to trump up its analysis in the first place shows just how scared major companies are of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party. It also reveals that the lobby group is out of touch with public opinion, as support has grown for renationalising the railway network and utilities companies. A decade on from the financial crisis, with average wages no higher than they were before the crash, people have had enough of big companies charging a king\u2019s ransom for their products and services, while doling out huge sums of money to their senior executives and shareholders. Despite this, Labour\u2019s reputation in the City and in boardrooms up and down the country is not ideal for a government in waiting. Many company bosses worry that Labour would damage the British economy as much, if not more so, than Brexit. Corbyn is regularly asked at business conferences if he dislikes people getting wealthy from running a company. It is a concern the party must address to win over swing voters who will be vital in the forthcoming election. Labour also still suffers from a degree of mistrust about its ability to safely manage the public finances. The accusation that Labour was reckless in the run-up to the financial crisis might well be misguided \u2013 paying nurses well and building schools was not the reason for the banking crash \u2013 but the Tory propaganda since 2008 still sticks in the minds of many. The tide is turning against austerity. The Conservatives have become profligate and are recklessly throwing money about to win votes in an upcoming election. But in a straight fight about who can be trusted to raise spending the most, Labour still needs to make greater efforts to convince the public. Talking more openly about its plans for renationalisation would help to allay public concern. If the policy is as popular as the party believes, then it should have little to fear. If the CBI got its numbers so badly wrong, what is the accurate cost and benefit as Labour sees it? The party should spell this out in detail as a matter of priority. There are legitimate questions about Labour\u2019s spending plans. About the impact nationalising large swaths of the economy might have on business investment, or about the costs and benefits. But the row last week was not a constructive one. The quality of debate badly needs improving on both sides. Charting Thomas Cook\u2019s course on to the rocks The inquiry into the demise of Thomas Cook continues this week, after an opening evidence session in which MPs on the business select committee didn\u2019t learn a great deal. Former boss Peter Fankhauser, who gave evidence last week, insisted he hadn\u2019t just taken the job for the hefty salary and bonuses but, after 20 years with the company, truly believed he could turn around the business he loved around. Ultimately, he explained, it was loaded with too much debt to survive one-off shocks, such as a European heatwave that led to a plunge in bookings. The picture painted by Fankhauser and his fellow board members was of a cruise liner that was far too close to the iceberg by the time he got his hands on the tiller.

Superdry boss will have no one to blame but himself So Mr Superdry is staying on for more than one season.

      "bodyText": "The freeclimber who scaled the Shard in July is being taken to court by the skyscraper\u2019s owners for breaching an injunction. George King, 20, who climbed the 72-storey building without ropes or suction cups, will appear at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Monday. Although a criminal charge for public nuisance has been dropped against King, he could face a fine or a short prison sentence if the civil proceedings turn out in Teighmore Ltd\u2019s favour. The injunction on climbing the Shard was put in place in 2018 to prevent Ian Bone, a veteran campaigner and founder of the anarchist newspaper Class War, from leading a protest about the number of empty luxury apartments within the building. In the same year, the Shard secured a high court injunction against Alain Robert, the urban climber nicknamed the French Spiderman to stop him from climbing the building. King added that as he scaled the tallest building in Europe, he had seen a sign on a door of the viewing deck which stated going beyond that point would be in breach of the court order. However, King said he was concerned about the case against him as the lack of other people being prosecuted for breaching the injunction meant there was no precedent set for the harshness of any potential punishment. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to take what comes,\u201d he added. The Crown Prosecution Service has previously refused to comment on the legal status of climbing high-rise structures such as cranes and skyscrapers, but there are other ways to prosecute people for taking such risks. In 2016, four climbers from Suffolk were charged with the offence of threatening behaviour for causing alarm and distress to residents in Lowestoft. At the time, a spokesperson for the force said they feared the men \u201cmay have fallen and not only killed themselves but innocent passersby on the ground.\u201d When King scaled the 310-metre (1,017ft) building on 8 July, he nearly slipped when generators on the building began pumping dust on to the metal bars he was climbing. He was met by officers from the Metropolitan police after reaching the Shard\u2019s summit in about 45 minutes, but was not arrested. The unaided climb was the first the then 19-year-old, who frequently posts Instagram videos of himself climbing cranes, had attempted on a high-rise building. But King has said he will not be attempting any similar feats in the UK. He added that life had been \u201cpretty crazy\u201d since news of his climb blew up and that he had quit his job as a personal trainer at a gym. So far, said King, he has accepted a book deal with HarperCollins, begun filming for a documentary about the event and has been in talks to host his own TV series \u2013 on top of interest from two brands who have asked him to promote their merchandise. King\u2019s manager Bryan Yeubrey, who also manages Robert, suggested the Shard\u2019s owners should rescind their complaint. The Shard\u2019s management team have been contacted for comment.",

He did not dispute that Vahaamahina deserved to be sent off \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s very clear\u201d \u2013 but said there were \u201cother decisions I don\u2019t totally agree with\u201d. He was particularly referring to Moriarty\u2019s late try: \u201cI think the ball went forwards,\u201d Brunel said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the decision again.\u201d The Wales wing Josh Adams felt differently. \u201cWe got a scrum on their line and then it was a moment of magic from Tomos Williams to rip the ball off their player. When it went to the TMO it was a case of \u2018what is he looking at now?\u2019 because we were jogging back to the halfway line. He checked and thankfully it was all good and we got that vital try.\u201d Wales\u2019s opening try-scorer Aaron Wainwight, the player on the receiving end of Vahaamahina\u2019s elbow, also felt the sending-off was justified. \u201cWe were in the maul and he had me by the neck to start off with,\u201d the flanker said. \u201cI was trying to get the ref\u2019s attention and then the elbow came in. It wasn\u2019t very nice at the time. I was a bit surprised the ref didn\u2019t see it but thankfully the ref pulled it up and it was dealt with. Fair play to the boys they put the pressure on afterwards and saw the game through. \u201cIt was a brutal game, very tight so we\u2019re pleased to come away with the win. It wasn\u2019t the best performance, so it\u2019s exciting to see what we will be able to achieve when we do perform at our best. There are no celebrations yet \u2013 we haven\u2019t got the job done yet. The celebrations will come after we come away with the trophy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Warren Gatland was contemplating what to say on TV. He was working out in his mind how he would explain it to the press. After 11 years and nearing the end of his 124th match in charge, he was staring down the barrel of the end to his career as the Wales coach. He was oblivious to the thousands of fans streaming out of the stadium but even they will have heard his sigh of relief when Ross Moriarty\u2019s try was awarded with six minutes to go. It could have been heard for miles.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/20/wales-france-rugby-world-cup-2019-quarter-final\">Wales come from behind to beat 14-man France in World Cup quarter-final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Gatland wore the look a man who understood how close his side were to heading home and it would be no surprise if he afforded himself a stiff drink on Sunday night. \u201cYou start going through lots of emotions,\u201d he said, somewhat understatedly.</p> \n<p>He had said seven days before, when it was confirmed Wales would be facing France at a World Cup for the first time since the 2011 semi-final, that he did not feel like he had finished with the tournament. He would have had to reconsider had the referee, Jaco Peyper, ultimately decided to rule out Moriarty\u2019s try. \u201cIronic,\u201d was Gatland\u2019s wry judgment when comparing this one-point victory in which a red card had been decisive with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/15/wales-france-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">that meeting in Auckland</a> eight years ago.</p> \n<p>When these sides last met, at the start of this year\u2019s Six Nations, Gatland\u2019s take was that his side had \u201cforgotten how to lose\u201d. They trailed by 16 points at half-time then, nine here, but this was the greater escape. And Gatland knew it.</p> \n<p>For this was a rank Wales performance, totally outplayed by France, who contributed some delightful rugby. Gatland seemed not to care too much about that. He has made winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/oct/20/the-better-team-lost-says-warren-gatland-after-wales-squeeze-past-france-20-19-video\" title=\"\">by any means necessary</a> Wales\u2019s modus operandi and it must be considered a success that, leaving World Cup warm-up matches aside, they have won their last 19 matches.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e59a9f6f-4cec-4af6-bcc4-d9016ab785b0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cSu2Fhe5Qb8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Put simply, Gatland would have no qualms if Wales won all of their matches here 3-0. Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, who is set to join the France coaching staff after this tournament, would no doubt agree. For if Wales did anything well on Sunday, they scrambled in defence superbly. As Gatland said: \u201cCredit to these players, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that they don\u2019t give up.\u201d</p> \n<p>He pinpointed France\u2019s decision to kick at goal towards the end of the first half, with Wales nine points down, as the pivotal moment of the match. Romain Ntamack struck a post, Wales held out until the interval and France\u2019s swashbuckling fly-half did not emerge for the second half. He had been levelled just beforehand by Dan Biggar and it was George North\u2019s last-ditch tackle that stopped a certain try.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/20/i-went-through-emotions-warren-gatland-wales-france\">Warren Gatland admits \u2018the better team lost\u2019 after Wales beat France</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>You might think in a World Cup semi-final, defending well is a prerequisite. Wales cannot keep relying on a refusal to admit defeat but there is a growing body of evidence to suggest otherwise.

      "bodyText": "Warren Gatland was contemplating what to say on TV. He was working out in his mind how he would explain it to the press. After 11 years and nearing the end of his 124th match in charge, he was staring down the barrel of the end to his career as the Wales coach. He was oblivious to the thousands of fans streaming out of the stadium but even they will have heard his sigh of relief when Ross Moriarty\u2019s try was awarded with six minutes to go. It could have been heard for miles. Gatland wore the look a man who understood how close his side were to heading home and it would be no surprise if he afforded himself a stiff drink on Sunday night. \u201cYou start going through lots of emotions,\u201d he said, somewhat understatedly. He had said seven days before, when it was confirmed Wales would be facing France at a World Cup for the first time since the 2011 semi-final, that he did not feel like he had finished with the tournament. He would have had to reconsider had the referee, Jaco Peyper, ultimately decided to rule out Moriarty\u2019s try. \u201cIronic,\u201d was Gatland\u2019s wry judgment when comparing this one-point victory in which a red card had been decisive with that meeting in Auckland eight years ago. When these sides last met, at the start of this year\u2019s Six Nations, Gatland\u2019s take was that his side had \u201cforgotten how to lose\u201d. They trailed by 16 points at half-time then, nine here, but this was the greater escape. And Gatland knew it. For this was a rank Wales performance, totally outplayed by France, who contributed some delightful rugby. Gatland seemed not to care too much about that. He has made winning by any means necessary Wales\u2019s modus operandi and it must be considered a success that, leaving World Cup warm-up matches aside, they have won their last 19 matches. Put simply, Gatland would have no qualms if Wales won all of their matches here 3-0. Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, who is set to join the France coaching staff after this tournament, would no doubt agree. For if Wales did anything well on Sunday, they scrambled in defence superbly. As Gatland said: \u201cCredit to these players, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that they don\u2019t give up.\u201d He pinpointed France\u2019s decision to kick at goal towards the end of the first half, with Wales nine points down, as the pivotal moment of the match. Romain Ntamack struck a post, Wales held out until the interval and France\u2019s swashbuckling fly-half did not emerge for the second half. He had been levelled just beforehand by Dan Biggar and it was George North\u2019s last-ditch tackle that stopped a certain try. You might think in a World Cup semi-final, defending well is a prerequisite. Wales cannot keep relying on a refusal to admit defeat but there is a growing body of evidence to suggest otherwise. The final four years ago was contested by the teams with the two best attacks but England and Wales have ensured there are two home nations in the final four for the first time since 1991 and they have done so by having the best defences. There have been some pretty average attacking performances in those 19 victories \u2013 last autumn against Australia and over Scotland during this year\u2019s Six Nations spring to mind \u2013 but as Eddie Jones said before England booked their semi-final place: \u201cTournaments, and particularly a World Cup, is about a team sticking together. The rugby in a World Cup is pretty simple. You don\u2019t see brilliant rugby in World Cups. You see teams that are able to do things over and over again well \u2013 deal with the intensity, application, work hard for each other \u2013 that wins World Cups.\u201d They do not always see eye to eye but you sense Gatland would agree with England\u2019s coach and as Gatland reminded us on Sunday: \u201cAlun Wyn Jones has been saying we are 240 minutes from doing something [memorable] for the rest of your life and we\u2019re down to 160 now, so if you can\u2019t get excited about that then nothing will excite you.\u201d Wales, now into their third World Cup semi-final, have every right to be excited about Sunday\u2019s showdown with South Africa. First, however, they will have to wait for the relief to subside.",

The highest compliment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/19/sam-underhill-tom-curry-england-australia\" title=\"\">you can pay England</a> is that even the All Blacks cannot take a place in the final for granted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/19/sam-underhill-tom-curry-england-australia\">Dynamic duo Sam Underhill and Tom Curry give England comic-book gusto</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is even possible New Zealand have done Eddie Jones\u2019s side a favour by thrashing Ireland so convincingly on their way to Saturday\u2019s semi-final in Yokohama. Had they prevailed in a narrow, scrappy encounter, their next opponents may have been tempted to get ahead of themselves. Now the equation is starkly simple: nothing less than England\u2019s absolute best will be remotely good enough.</p> \n<p>What makes the impending duel even more compelling is the marked contrast in styles. The world\u2019s most lethal attack against the tournament\u2019s tightest defence? In the modern game the equation is more complicated but the manner in which England kept their discipline and pulled away from Australia suggested a side who believe they possess the tools to fix almost any problem.</p> \n<p>In the relatively recent past there would have been a chance of England getting seriously flustered after the Wallabies, 14-3 down early on, had pulled back to 17-16 with 35 minutes left.

      "bodyText": "A big week is looming in Japan, with the country\u2019s new emperor set to be enthroned in the presence of dignitaries from around the world. Within the next fortnight global rugby will also be hailing new kings, although their identity remains uncertain. The highest compliment you can pay England is that even the All Blacks cannot take a place in the final for granted. It is even possible New Zealand have done Eddie Jones\u2019s side a favour by thrashing Ireland so convincingly on their way to Saturday\u2019s semi-final in Yokohama. Had they prevailed in a narrow, scrappy encounter, their next opponents may have been tempted to get ahead of themselves. Now the equation is starkly simple: nothing less than England\u2019s absolute best will be remotely good enough. What makes the impending duel even more compelling is the marked contrast in styles. The world\u2019s most lethal attack against the tournament\u2019s tightest defence? In the modern game the equation is more complicated but the manner in which England kept their discipline and pulled away from Australia suggested a side who believe they possess the tools to fix almost any problem. In the relatively recent past there would have been a chance of England getting seriously flustered after the Wallabies, 14-3 down early on, had pulled back to 17-16 with 35 minutes left. Despite Australia\u2019s poor second-half record against Eddie Jones\u2019s England sides, the outcome seemed far from certain. For them, in such circumstances, to respond with 23 unanswered points and win 40-16 was no small achievement. If there was a bit of fortune about the two interception tries that widened the margin, England are increasingly making their own luck. The Wallabies were turned over in possession 18 times: some of it was the product of their own inaccuracy and rash decisions but England\u2019s controlled aggression in and around the tackle area was also a major factor. Not for nothing did Tom Curry win the award for the man of the match, although Kyle Sinckler cannot have been far behind. New Zealand will be less profligate; they will also be less tactically gung-ho and possess a far better kicking game. But England, unlike Ireland, are a team on the up, having started to marry physical dynamism with surer judgment and calmer decision-making. Do the All Blacks have prop forwards who offer a greater carrying threat than Sinckler and Mako Vunipola? Do they have a hooker in better form than Jamie George? Are Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock superior locks to Maro Itoje? If, on the day, the answer to even some of those questions is \u201cno\u201d then England will feel they can, at worst, rattle the All Blacks\u2019 cage. The fast-improving flankers Curry and Sam Underhill, who even gave the illustrious Wallabies duo of David Pocock and Michael Hooper a tough match, will also be key figures. It is ridiculous, as Underhill himself said afterwards, to think the all-action Curry is only 21. Collectively the pair have the ability to make England a nuisance against any opposition and the big stage is bringing out the best in them. If a British &amp; Irish Lions squad were being selected this week, the depth of back-row candidates would be impressive. On the flip side, New Zealand\u2019s Ardie Savea has been among the players of the tournament and Kieran Read, yet to experience a World Cup defeat after 11 years as a Test No 8, has chosen the perfect moment to rediscover the form that seemed to have gone missing following spinal surgery in late 2017. Beauden Barrett and Sevu Reece look scarily sharp and Richie Mo\u2019unga\u2019s crossfield chips have already caught out a succession of unwary opposing wings. No one should assume, in summary, New Zealand will tighten up under pressure or are due a bad day.

      "body": "<p>No dog-whistle distracts the British press quite like the sound of a politician blowing hard on a policy to interfere with the BBC. So it was not a surprise that, as the government headed into a weekend of heavy Brexit weather, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/16/nicky-morgan-open-minded-about-bbc-licence-fee-future\" title=\"\">the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, revealed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/16/nicky-morgan-open-minded-about-bbc-licence-fee-future\" title=\"\">she was not entirely opposed to converting the BBC licence fee into a \u201cNetflix-style subscription\u201d</a>. The licence fee is compulsory for those who use a monitor as a television to watch or record any live TV, or to use BBC iPlayer, and currently delivers the broadcaster \u00a33.75bn a year (about a quarter of Netflix\u2019s total revenue).</p> <p>Off-the-cuff remarks made at a culture select committee meeting are not (thankfully) policy, and Morgan\u2019s department later clarified that there were no plans to review the current BBC charter, which runs until 2027 \u2013 and by then, who knows which national institutions will have collapsed? But even connoisseurs of the BBC\u2019s dangerous moments could tell you we are currently in a vintage dangerous moment.</p> <p>Part of this is down to the general upheaval that every institution is currently facing, driven by a mix of unstable geopolitics and technological change; but part of it is about the simultaneous chronic leadership crisis in the government and at the BBC. In case anybody hasn\u2019t noticed, the current government is not fully focused on the important work of long-term vision and institution-building right now. What\u2019s more, it is temporarily led by someone who long drew a paycheck from some of the most virulent anti-BBC publications, which have a direct vested interest in dramatically reducing the level of the licence fee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-bbc-watch-closely-change-is-coming\">The Guardian view on the BBC: watch closely \u2013 change is coming | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The confusion of Brexit ought to have been a golden moment for the BBC, an opportunity to practise dazzling explanatory journalism on a nightly basis, to apply cultural balm to the ideological wounds, and to lead the UK gently through a minefield of booby-traps. Quite the opposite has happened. Caught in the crosshairs of a polarised debate about Brexit, the corporation\u2019s news division did not seem to have either adequate authority or a robust enough strategy to make a case against the deluge of incoming influence campaigns. Its journalism, unusually, also struggled to be serious and consistent enough to meet the complex gravity of the moment.</p> <p>The dynamics of neutrality and objectivity in modern journalism are under daily scrutiny, and leadership needs to be able to address criticism without bending in the political wind. News is vexing and complex \u2013 ask any editor in the US trying to navigate Donald Trump\u2019s administration \u2013 but the mark of an important media institution is that it can catch what is thrown at it and make sense of it for its audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a/290_164_4067_2441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naga Munchetty\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naga Munchetty was censured for commenting on Donald Trump\u2019s alleged racism, a decision later reversed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, at the BBC, a percolating leadership crisis has shown the corporation to be unusually captured and inarticulate about its role \u2013 a feebleness that has infected its coverage and seems endemic in its management. Most distressingly, it is not just the external pressure that threatens a valuable national asset: the BBC has self-sabotaged on an astonishingly regular basis. It has a deep bench of phenomenally talented staff, but even their patience and loyalty is finite.</p> <p>The most recent head-in-hands moment was the censuring of one of its on-air presenters, Naga Munchetty, for answering a question about her experience of racial harassment from her uncensured co-presenter. The decision revealed that the BBC\u2019s internal compass and processes about its standards and culture are broken. The director general, Tony Hall, reversed the decision only when the groundswell of reaction from his own staff and the public became unignorable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/17/why-bbc-subscriptions-are-a-long-way-off\">'You can't stop people watching': why BBC subscriptions are a long way off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Munchetty episode might seem like a minor incident, but it spoke volumes about the dysfunctional state of BBC leadership. All organisations make mistakes, embarrassing and damaging ones at that, and the default position of the BBC is to be in crisis. However, Hall\u2019s team failed to understand the lessons of the disgraceful episode in which its most talented China expert, Carrie Gracie, resigned her position after a public row about underpayment of women. Munchetty and Gracie were both compromised by the corporation\u2019s management failure, yet there is little sign of change at the top.</p> <p>Hall returned to the BBC in 2013 as director general, following the scandal around Jimmy Savile, which led to the rapid dismissal of George Entwistle. Hall did an excellent job of stabilising the corporation over the next few years, but he never looked like a leader who was fully invested in making the BBC fit for the future. At the time, Hall made several senior appointments without observing the hiring protocol usually required by a public organisation, citing the importance of the chemistry of the team over any considerations of process. Six years later, Hall is still there and that chemistry has produced a directionless and defensive organisation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/22/the-bbc-needs-a-new-strategy-in-this-era-of-fake-news\">The BBC needs a new strategy in this era of fake news | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Should he resign? In any normal circumstances, the answer ought to be yes. But the prospect of Boris Johnson appointing a successor, riddled as he is with alleged conflicts of interest and a need for \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d, is perhaps an equally dangerous prospect.</p> <p>Where is the governance of the BBC in all this? One suspects their eyes are so closely on the immediate horizon they have not really thought through what is coming over the hill. National strategies for information security, the role of public media and the necessity to regulate technology platforms could not be more urgent priorities. The BBC ought to be central to any debate about a much wider plan for Britain\u2019s cultural and political future in a very challenging climate, yet instead it risks an accidental death at the hands of those who cannot see or do not care what is at stake.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2019 to clarify who must pay the licence fee.</p>",

      "bodyText": "No dog-whistle distracts the British press quite like the sound of a politician blowing hard on a policy to interfere with the BBC. So it was not a surprise that, as the government headed into a weekend of heavy Brexit weather, the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, revealed she was not entirely opposed to converting the BBC licence fee into a \u201cNetflix-style subscription\u201d. The licence fee is compulsory for those who use a monitor as a television to watch or record any live TV, or to use BBC iPlayer, and currently delivers the broadcaster \u00a33.75bn a year (about a quarter of Netflix\u2019s total revenue). Off-the-cuff remarks made at a culture select committee meeting are not (thankfully) policy, and Morgan\u2019s department later clarified that there were no plans to review the current BBC charter, which runs until 2027 \u2013 and by then, who knows which national institutions will have collapsed? But even connoisseurs of the BBC\u2019s dangerous moments could tell you we are currently in a vintage dangerous moment. Part of this is down to the general upheaval that every institution is currently facing, driven by a mix of unstable geopolitics and technological change; but part of it is about the simultaneous chronic leadership crisis in the government and at the BBC. In case anybody hasn\u2019t noticed, the current government is not fully focused on the important work of long-term vision and institution-building right now. What\u2019s more, it is temporarily led by someone who long drew a paycheck from some of the most virulent anti-BBC publications, which have a direct vested interest in dramatically reducing the level of the licence fee. The confusion of Brexit ought to have been a golden moment for the BBC, an opportunity to practise dazzling explanatory journalism on a nightly basis, to apply cultural balm to the ideological wounds, and to lead the UK gently through a minefield of booby-traps. Quite the opposite has happened. Caught in the crosshairs of a polarised debate about Brexit, the corporation\u2019s news division did not seem to have either adequate authority or a robust enough strategy to make a case against the deluge of incoming influence campaigns. Its journalism, unusually, also struggled to be serious and consistent enough to meet the complex gravity of the moment. The dynamics of neutrality and objectivity in modern journalism are under daily scrutiny, and leadership needs to be able to address criticism without bending in the political wind. News is vexing and complex \u2013 ask any editor in the US trying to navigate Donald Trump\u2019s administration \u2013 but the mark of an important media institution is that it can catch what is thrown at it and make sense of it for its audience. Instead, at the BBC, a percolating leadership crisis has shown the corporation to be unusually captured and inarticulate about its role \u2013 a feebleness that has infected its coverage and seems endemic in its management. Most distressingly, it is not just the external pressure that threatens a valuable national asset: the BBC has self-sabotaged on an astonishingly regular basis. It has a deep bench of phenomenally talented staff, but even their patience and loyalty is finite. The most recent head-in-hands moment was the censuring of one of its on-air presenters, Naga Munchetty, for answering a question about her experience of racial harassment from her uncensured co-presenter. The decision revealed that the BBC\u2019s internal compass and processes about its standards and culture are broken. The director general, Tony Hall, reversed the decision only when the groundswell of reaction from his own staff and the public became unignorable. The Munchetty episode might seem like a minor incident, but it spoke volumes about the dysfunctional state of BBC leadership. All organisations make mistakes, embarrassing and damaging ones at that, and the default position of the BBC is to be in crisis. However, Hall\u2019s team failed to understand the lessons of the disgraceful episode in which its most talented China expert, Carrie Gracie, resigned her position after a public row about underpayment of women. Munchetty and Gracie were both compromised by the corporation\u2019s management failure, yet there is little sign of change at the top. Hall returned to the BBC in 2013 as director general, following the scandal around Jimmy Savile, which led to the rapid dismissal of George Entwistle. Hall did an excellent job of stabilising the corporation over the next few years, but he never looked like a leader who was fully invested in making the BBC fit for the future. At the time, Hall made several senior appointments without observing the hiring protocol usually required by a public organisation, citing the importance of the chemistry of the team over any considerations of process. Six years later, Hall is still there and that chemistry has produced a directionless and defensive organisation. Should he resign? In any normal circumstances, the answer ought to be yes. But the prospect of Boris Johnson appointing a successor, riddled as he is with alleged conflicts of interest and a need for \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d, is perhaps an equally dangerous prospect. Where is the governance of the BBC in all this? One suspects their eyes are so closely on the immediate horizon they have not really thought through what is coming over the hill. National strategies for information security, the role of public media and the necessity to regulate technology platforms could not be more urgent priorities. The BBC ought to be central to any debate about a much wider plan for Britain\u2019s cultural and political future in a very challenging climate, yet instead it risks an accidental death at the hands of those who cannot see or do not care what is at stake. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2019 to clarify who must pay the licence fee.",

Seven years after Tinder made choosing a date as simple as flicking your thumb across a smartphone screen, it is by far the most-used dating app in the UK and the US. Downloaded 300m times and with more than 5 million paying subscribers, it is the highest-grossing app of any kind in the world, according to the analysts <a href=\"https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/mobile-hit-new-milestones-in-q1-2019/\" title=\"\">App Annie</a>.

If he finds it less daunting than others might, that\u2019s because, before he took over Tinder in 2018, he was in charge of OkCupid, the Tinder of the 00s. He has spent much of his working life helping people to find love.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of our employees are energised by that very mission,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not selling plumbing supplies, right? Obviously, plumbing is really important, but ours is a really noble and exciting mission. So, when we\u2019re taking new risks \u2013 new challenges, new chances \u2013 we know that, if we\u2019re successful, it\u2019s about helping members connect.\u201d</p> <p>At times, though, it has felt as if Tinder has chased that goal with too much passion. Launching on college campuses, before expanding to New York, London and then everywhere, Tinder rapidly gained a reputation as less of a dating app and more of a \u201chook-up\u201d app: laser-focused at finding users a match as quickly as possible, with minimal fuss between opening the app and getting lucky.</p> <p>In its early days, Tinder leaned into this reputation. Perhaps the most notorious feature was the introduction of a secret \u201cElo ranking\u201d, a term borrowed from the chess world to describe a way to score people based on their previous matches. With the Tinder version, your score went up a lot if hot people swiped right on you; if ugly people swiped left on you, it went down just as much. Whether or not your matches were hot was based on their own Elo ranking, and so on.</p> <p>Matching hot people to hot people felt like the purest distillation of what Tinder was \u2013 and a good summation of the often bro-filled atmosphere in the office in the early days. (This approach continues to shake out in <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/14/technology/tinder-lawsuit/index.html?iid=EL\" title=\"\">messy legal battles between cofounders</a>, with allegations of sexual harassment blending <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/14/technology/tinder-lawsuit/index.html?iid=EL\" title=\"\">with claims of share-price manipulation</a>.) In hindsight, Seidman says, this approach was a mistake. Now, rather than how hot a person might be perceived to be, it\u2019s how often they use the app that takes priority \u2013 that and location, which, Seidman points out, is hardly an innovation. \u201cMy father has a story from when he was growing up in Queens. He was dating a woman who lived on the Upper East Side. She broke up with him because he was \u2018geographically undesirable\u2019.

According to the analytics firm App Ape, more than three-quarters are men \u2013 a disparity that is bad for everyone. Men complain about being ignored or mocked when they do get matched with a date. They are the main target of Tinder\u2019s revenue drives, with paid services such as Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold offering users the ability to promote themselves to the top of their likers\u2019 queues and highlight their profiles to others. (Tinder settled a class-action suit this year over age-discriminatory pricing for these features. It had been charging older users more for the same tools.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re  better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on Tinder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But women have it worse. Even putting aside Margaret Atwood\u2019s observation that men worry that women will laugh at them, while women worry that men will kill them, the misogyny on Tinder is the stuff of legend. One 2016 study, <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-04-men-tinder-licence-unattractive-women.html\" title=\"\">from Manchester Metropolitan University</a>, found that straight men who feel \u201clet down\u201d after finding a date was less attractive than her picture saw it as \u201ca licence to use their date as they saw fit\u201d. Meanwhile, dick pics, solicited and otherwise, are so ubiquitous that they are inspiring art. Francesca Harris, a student at the University of Nottingham, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/07/student-asks-men-of-tinder-to-send-her-dck-pics-for-art-300-of-them-come-through-10128368/\" title=\"\">used the app to solicit more than 300</a> (and one headshot of Donald Trump) for her fine-art degree show project, entitled The Modern Male.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a really, really, really clear view,\u201d Seidman says, \u201cwhich is that people who are awful need to be removed from these apps. We have a ton of work in our trust and safety group between tech and people \u2013 massive teams of moderators benefiting from AI. We have things in the app to educate people about how to behave. So we\u2019re coming at it from a lot of angles. If you have behaved badly, we want you out \u2013 and we want you out as quickly as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Seidman says Tinder\u2019s record has improved. \u201cWithout getting into lots of specific details about metrics, which I won\u2019t divulge, we\u2019re much, much, much better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on Tinder.\u201d</p> <p>But if Tinder is getting better at spotting abusive behaviour, and turfing perpetrators off the platform, what about the other side: are people learning to behave better in the first place? \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that if you grow up in a world where you are accustomed to digital social \u2013 you were on Fortnite with your friends or your friends of friends, or you did FaceTime with your aunt or your grandmother when you were a kid \u2013 you don\u2019t think of the digital world as a different world, one where the rules of decorum and the norms of behaviour that we take for granted in a bar or a restaurant just go out the window. It\u2019s not an alternate universe. It\u2019s a part of real life. Every next set of 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds who join Tinder have grown up in a different environment in terms of digital social life.\u201d</p> <p>That generational shift, Seidman says, is crucial to understanding Tinder\u2019s very visual skew, which differentiates it from older services such as OkCupid and has been blamed for the \u201cshallow\u201d nature of the connections it leads to. On OkCupid, when Seidman started, users were asked to fill in enormous questionnaires. An algorithm then purported to match them to those most compatible based on anything from big life choices to opinions on blockbuster movies. On Tinder, by contrast, the basic question is simpler: \u201cIs this person hot?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/22/why-childhood-sweethearts-no-longer-measure-up-and-six-other-ways-dating-has-changed\">Why childhood sweethearts no longer measure up \u2013 and six other ways dating has changed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Seidman argues that this shift is, in part, just a reflection of the changing nature of technology. \u201cThe internet has become vastly more visual over the past 20 years, right?\u201d Smartphones played a big part in this because they made it so much easier to upload photos. In fact, if you can remember the net before smartphones, Tinder may well not be for you. Half of the app\u2019s users are under 25 (and, Seidman emphasises, over 18), and signing up for an account as you arrive at university is virtually a rite of passage for Gen Z. With that comes new ambitions.</p> <p>The core of the Tinder interface, with its pictures and swiping, is, Seidman says, designed to replicate the \u201cclick\u201d that two people get when they lock eyes for the first time, only in a way that works for a generation that has already used to the idea of socialising online. So what next? The first date. \u201cTo what extent can we get the elements, the quality elements of a first date to happen digitally? The thing people are struggling with, is: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got this match. How can I figure out if we\u2019re going to like each other. Do we have anything to talk about? Can we connect and, you know, how\u2019s our chemistry?\u2019 Right? And so can we get more of what you would get and figure out on our first date?\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s first exploration into answering those questions is \u2026 odd. Swipe Night, running every Sunday in October, is Tinder\u2019s first original video production. As in the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch, viewers get to pick how the story progresses. Unlike Bandersnatch, they get matched with others on the platform who picked similar outcomes. \u201cWe\u2019re saying: \u2018Hey, not only is it connections that you make, but we think that the shared experience as a community \u2013 of coming together \u2013 is a really special one. We think that shared experiences as a community of people is a powerful, important and ancient idea \u2013 and it shouldn\u2019t go away.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As long as those shared experiences don\u2019t involve unwanted dick pics, he may have a point.</p>",

Francesca Harris, a student at the University of Nottingham, used the app to solicit more than 300 (and one headshot of Donald Trump) for her fine-art degree show project, entitled The Modern Male. \u201cWe have a really, really, really clear view,\u201d Seidman says, \u201cwhich is that people who are awful need to be removed from these apps. We have a ton of work in our trust and safety group between tech and people \u2013 massive teams of moderators benefiting from AI. We have things in the app to educate people about how to behave. So we\u2019re coming at it from a lot of angles. If you have behaved badly, we want you out \u2013 and we want you out as quickly as possible.\u201d Seidman says Tinder\u2019s record has improved. \u201cWithout getting into lots of specific details about metrics, which I won\u2019t divulge, we\u2019re much, much, much better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on Tinder.\u201d But if Tinder is getting better at spotting abusive behaviour, and turfing perpetrators off the platform, what about the other side: are people learning to behave better in the first place? \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that if you grow up in a world where you are accustomed to digital social \u2013 you were on Fortnite with your friends or your friends of friends, or you did FaceTime with your aunt or your grandmother when you were a kid \u2013 you don\u2019t think of the digital world as a different world, one where the rules of decorum and the norms of behaviour that we take for granted in a bar or a restaurant just go out the window. It\u2019s not an alternate universe. It\u2019s a part of real life. Every next set of 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds who join Tinder have grown up in a different environment in terms of digital social life.\u201d That generational shift, Seidman says, is crucial to understanding Tinder\u2019s very visual skew, which differentiates it from older services such as OkCupid and has been blamed for the \u201cshallow\u201d nature of the connections it leads to. On OkCupid, when Seidman started, users were asked to fill in enormous questionnaires. An algorithm then purported to match them to those most compatible based on anything from big life choices to opinions on blockbuster movies. On Tinder, by contrast, the basic question is simpler: \u201cIs this person hot?\u201d Seidman argues that this shift is, in part, just a reflection of the changing nature of technology. \u201cThe internet has become vastly more visual over the past 20 years, right?\u201d Smartphones played a big part in this because they made it so much easier to upload photos. In fact, if you can remember the net before smartphones, Tinder may well not be for you. Half of the app\u2019s users are under 25 (and, Seidman emphasises, over 18), and signing up for an account as you arrive at university is virtually a rite of passage for Gen Z. With that comes new ambitions. The core of the Tinder interface, with its pictures and swiping, is, Seidman says, designed to replicate the \u201cclick\u201d that two people get when they lock eyes for the first time, only in a way that works for a generation that has already used to the idea of socialising online. So what next? The first date. \u201cTo what extent can we get the elements, the quality elements of a first date to happen digitally? The thing people are struggling with, is: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got this match. How can I figure out if we\u2019re going to like each other. Do we have anything to talk about? Can we connect and, you know, how\u2019s our chemistry?\u2019 Right? And so can we get more of what you would get and figure out on our first date?\u201d The company\u2019s first exploration into answering those questions is \u2026 odd. Swipe Night, running every Sunday in October, is Tinder\u2019s first original video production. As in the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch, viewers get to pick how the story progresses. Unlike Bandersnatch, they get matched with others on the platform who picked similar outcomes. \u201cWe\u2019re saying: \u2018Hey, not only is it connections that you make, but we think that the shared experience as a community \u2013 of coming together \u2013 is a really special one. We think that shared experiences as a community of people is a powerful, important and ancient idea \u2013 and it shouldn\u2019t go away.\u2019\u201d As long as those shared experiences don\u2019t involve unwanted dick pics, he may have a point.",

Does he blood a new generation or make changes gradually?

He applied a tight rein from the start, instructing his players not to offload unless the act carried a minimum of risk, and unlike Hansen, Gatland and Jones, he was reluctant to expose young players early, preferring to wait until they were embedded in his system. What players such as Carbery, Ringrose and Larmour provide is the means for a more expansive, bolder approach, while retaining the abrasion they developed at forward.</p> \n<p>\u201cNew Zealand were without doubt better than us but we also created opportunities,\u201d said Ryan, who at 23 has developed into one of the leading second rows in Test rugby. \u201cWhat we have to remember is that some of the wins we have had under Joe Schmidt set standards that were higher [than] before he took over.

      "bodyText": "A wit once stated, after surveying the wreckage of another forlorn Five Nations campaign, that Ireland were in a critical state but it was not serious. Nothing a few shots could not make appear better. As the swaying lines of supporters made their way to the train station more than two hours after the end of one of the most sobering defeats in the six-year reign of Joe Schmidt, their optimism had not been doused by the raging fire that burned deep within New Zealand. They scorched the hopes of a team who had never made it beyond the last eight but hope sprung infernal. Few teams would have got near New Zealand such was the way they married ambition with precision, a potent cocktail that took the legs from Ireland before it messed with their heads. \u201cIt is hard enough playing New Zealand with your A game, never mind the D version,\u201d said the Ireland wing Keith Earls, one of the 30-something players whose international careers may have ended along with that of the captain, Rory Best, who at a time of high emotions gave a measured response to a defeat Ireland had not expected, never mind the size of it. \u201cWe just seem to shoot ourselves in the foot in the quarter-finals of a World Cup,\u201d said Earls, one of Ireland\u2019s few players who made an impact, if only in defence where, often confronted with the twin threats of the wings George Bridge and Sevu Reece bearing down on him together, scrambled brilliantly at times to make recovery tackles and prevent a rout from turning into a landslide. The priority for Ireland is to ensure all the gains they made under Schmidt \u2013 Six Nations titles, a series victory in Australia and their first two victories over the All Blacks \u2013 are not undone by a defeat to a team who have, down the decades, been the masters of invention and single-minded resolution. They have opted for continuity with Andy Farrell, the defence coach who oversaw the only two shutouts against New Zealand in the last four years, taking charge. It will be new territory for Stuart Lancaster\u2019s former right-hand man with England. What marks out the very best coaches, such as Steve Hansen, Warren Gatland, Eddie Jones and Schmidt, is their ability to make the right selection calls far more often than not, a vital quality that Australia\u2019s Michael Cheika ultimately lacked. Farrell will have to make decisions over players such as Johnny Sexton, Earls, Rob Kearney, Peter O\u2019Mahony and Cian Healy before the Six Nations. Does he blood a new generation or make changes gradually? What he does have is a nucleus of players aged 24 or younger who have international experience and should be in the leadership group come 2023: Garry Ringrose, Jordan Larmour, Joey Carbery, Jacob Stockdale, James Ryan and Andrew Porter. Hansen remarked before Saturday\u2019s match that under Schmidt Ireland were a well-organised, structured team who rarely depart from the prepared script. It was when they needed to, not so much on Saturday because the brutal manner in which they were torn apart gave them little scope for improvisation, but certainly in the pool defeat against Japan, that the difference between succeeding in Europe and winning a World Cup was laid bare. Ireland under Schmidt did not play like a New Zealand team. He applied a tight rein from the start, instructing his players not to offload unless the act carried a minimum of risk, and unlike Hansen, Gatland and Jones, he was reluctant to expose young players early, preferring to wait until they were embedded in his system. What players such as Carbery, Ringrose and Larmour provide is the means for a more expansive, bolder approach, while retaining the abrasion they developed at forward. \u201cNew Zealand were without doubt better than us but we also created opportunities,\u201d said Ryan, who at 23 has developed into one of the leading second rows in Test rugby. \u201cWhat we have to remember is that some of the wins we have had under Joe Schmidt set standards that were higher [than] before he took over. We have to learn from this and come back stronger.\u201d Schmidt reflected that he carried his scars more than his successes and the latest wound would run deepest. It was not the finale he or Best had dreamed of but, as he appreciates as well as anyone, there are very few happy endings when New Zealand are the opposition. Ireland supporters heading back to Shinjuku had only praise for a man who had touched their dreams with belief, the romantics turned realists. That may be Tokyo Joe\u2019s greatest legacy.",

      "body": "<p>Karl Ove Knausgaard, who detailed the minutiae of his own life in the six-volume autobiographical novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/29/the-end-karl-ove-knausgaard\">My Struggle</a>, has taken on a new challenge: the Norwegian writer is to become the sixth contributor to the Future Library, which collects works by contemporary authors that will remain unread until 2114.</p> <p>The Future Library is described as a \u201cliving, breathing, organic artwork, unfolding over 100 years\u201d by its creator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/28/katie-paterson-interview-turner\">the Scottish artist Katie Paterson</a>. It currently consists of 1,000 spruce trees that were planted in Oslo\u2019s Nordmarka forest in 2014. After a century, they will be cut down and turned into paper. On this, the manuscripts by participating authors including Margaret Atwood, David Mitchell and Elif Shafak, will finally be printed.</p> <p>Knausgaard is the first Norwegian writer to contribute to the project; Paterson called him \u201cone of the most exceptional authors of the 21st century\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor Knausgaard the duty of literature is \u2018to find a way into the world as it is\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Karl Ove Knausgaard, who detailed the minutiae of his own life in the six-volume autobiographical novel My Struggle, has taken on a new challenge: the Norwegian writer is to become the sixth contributor to the Future Library, which collects works by contemporary authors that will remain unread until 2114. The Future Library is described as a \u201cliving, breathing, organic artwork, unfolding over 100 years\u201d by its creator, the Scottish artist Katie Paterson. It currently consists of 1,000 spruce trees that were planted in Oslo\u2019s Nordmarka forest in 2014. After a century, they will be cut down and turned into paper. On this, the manuscripts by participating authors including Margaret Atwood, David Mitchell and Elif Shafak, will finally be printed. Knausgaard is the first Norwegian writer to contribute to the project; Paterson called him \u201cone of the most exceptional authors of the 21st century\u201d. \u201cFor Knausgaard the duty of literature is \u2018to find a way into the world as it is\u2019. His epic portraits of human life are immersive, magnetic and absorbing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe finds the sublime in the everyday, and dissolves boundaries between imagination and reality through acts of radical self-exposure.\u201d The author praised the Future Library in turn: \u201cIt\u2019s such a brilliant idea, I very much like the thought that you will have readers who are still not born \u2013 it\u2019s like sending a little ship from our time to them. I like that it will be opened in 100 years and I like the slowness of the forest growing, that everything is connected. It\u2019s such a wonderful green artwork.\u201d Knausgaard said he has already started writing his manuscript, but would not reveal any details. While nobody alive today would read his words, he said he still had the same \u201cmoral and ethical responsibility\u201d to those he wrote about. \u201cYou can\u2019t really afford to think about readers anyway when you\u2019re writing, you have to be free of those thoughts,\u201d he said.

After conceding an early try when their attempt to hide their fly-half, Yu Tamura, on the blindside of a Springboks scrum was detected by the scrum-half, Faf de Klerk, who wasted no time in firing a pass to Makazole Mapimpi on the left wing, they rallied. The host country applied such concerted pressure that lesser teams would have wilted, but the try Japan desperately needed was denied by a dark green wall that would not fracture.</p> \n<p>For all the cleverness of their play and their ability to keep the ball alive, South Africa were ready for what hit them, having prepared assiduously. Japan\u2019s inability to improvise cost them and for all that South Africa\u2019s might and power consumed them after the interval to the point where they were scrummaged and mauled into submission, it was De Klerk, a player small even by Japanese standards, who most thwarted their ambition.</p> \n<p>As well as creating the opening try for Mapimpi, De Klerk smothered a number of attacks. After 30 minutes South Africa had attempted 90 tackles to their opponents\u2019 16, a reflection of how the hosts were dominating possession, but their line was rarely cut, and they survived the loss of the prop Tendai Mtawarira to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle on his opposite number Keita Inagaki. He sustained a suspected broken rib but played on until the second half and came back on with 13 minutes to go after his replacement, Isileli Nakajima, pulled a hamstring.</p> \n<p>Mtawarira was fortunate Inagaki broke his fall with his left elbow otherwise he would have landed on his head and the card would have been red. He may be cited before Sunday\u2019s semi-final against Wales but his departure gave Japan an advantage they needed to take because the South Africa coach, Rassie Erasmus, had filled his bench with six forwards, including a fresh tight five. This would give his side the legs they would need in the final quarter, when the pace Japan play at takes its toll.</p> \n<p>All Japan mustered in Mtawarira\u2019s absence was a Tamura penalty, won at a scrum that earned a roar from the crowd who did everything to keep their team going. South Africa absorbed the blows and should have gone into the interval with a healthier lead than two points: Lukhanyo Am wasted Damian de Allende\u2019s break by throwing a pass out of the back of his hand at Mapimpi\u2019s legs rather than his hands before De Allende was denied a try, a tad harshly, for not releasing after the prop Jiwon Koo fell on him.</p> \n<p>Erasmus admitted he was nervous at half-time because of his side\u2019s failure to establish a decent lead, but it was Japan who made mistakes at the start of the second half. South Africa tightened up, De Klerk kicking for position after Japan\u2019s back three had comfortably dealt with high kicks unlike Willie le Roux, who was spooked after being clattered early on by Michael Leitch and made multiple errors.</p> \n<p>The game started to be played at South Africa\u2019s pace. Scrums and mauls turned into penalties, three of which Handre Pollard converted into points. Japan had to chase the game, but it was no longer being played on their terms and De Klerk made the game safe when, after barking orders at his forwards as they rumbled a maul 15 metres, he scored under the posts to seal his man-of-the-match performance.</p> \n<p>Japan kept coming, their spirit unbroken even though their tournament was over, but South Africa in this mood are the cruellest of opponents. For all their ability to move the ball in contact and seek space Japan were undone at set pieces. South Africa took four of their lineouts, the last of which was five metres from their own line when Pieter-Steph du Toit stole the ball at the front and 30 seconds later Mapimpi had his second try.</p> \n<p>\u201cSouth Africa were just too physical,\u201d said the Japan full-back, Lomano Lemeki. \u201cWe had our chances but did not take them. This World Cup has been crazy: before it you could walk down the street and do whatever you wanted. Now, everyone knows who you are which shows how popular rugby has become in Japan.

      "body": "<p>\u2018This year, Chris [Difford] and Glenn [Tilbrook] celebrate 45 years together,\u201d says the pre-gig announcer, making the Squeeze songwriters sound like an old married couple. There are certainly parallels. They met in Blackheath in 1973, after Tilbrook answered an advert for a guitarist in a \u201crecording and touring band: influences the Kinks, Lou Reed and Glenn Miller\u201d. This unlikely combo turned out to be an imaginary group that Difford had dreamed up in his bedroom. But once his lyric were paired with Tilbrook\u2019s tunes, their band struck pop gold. There have been ruptures and reconciliations since, and it was decades ago that they took up residency in the top 20 and 1981\u2019s East Side Story saw them talked about as the natural heirs to John Lennon and Paul McCartney. However, Squeeze\u2019s 2015 song Cradle to the Grave, the theme tune to Danny Baker\u2019s sitcom, explains the secret of their longevity. Tilbrook sings about not \u201cbeing a slave\u201d to past mistakes, and of defiantly fighting on: \u201cI won\u2019t go \u2019til I\u2019m ready.\u201d His band may be a much-loved institution rather than afforded the national treasure status granted the Kinks or Madness, but the vast Squeeze songbook documents a changing Britain as effectively as any historical drama.</p> <p>1985\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOc_eA584nA\">King George Street</a>, among the lesser-played songs that, according to Tilbrook, deserve another airing, mentions council estates, \u201cfrom before they sold them off\u201d. Lately, Squeeze have become more political. Their merch stall donates to food banks and in 2016 Tilbrook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jan/10/squeeze-rework-lyrics-to-criticise-cameron-during-marr-show-performance-video\">spontaneously changed his lyrics on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jan/10/squeeze-rework-lyrics-to-criticise-cameron-during-marr-show-performance-video\">The Andrew Marr </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jan/10/squeeze-rework-lyrics-to-criticise-cameron-during-marr-show-performance-video\">Show</a> to rail against \u201cthe destruction of the welfare state\u201d under fellow guest David Cameron.

      "bodyText": "\u2018This year, Chris [Difford] and Glenn [Tilbrook] celebrate 45 years together,\u201d says the pre-gig announcer, making the Squeeze songwriters sound like an old married couple. There are certainly parallels. They met in Blackheath in 1973, after Tilbrook answered an advert for a guitarist in a \u201crecording and touring band: influences the Kinks, Lou Reed and Glenn Miller\u201d. This unlikely combo turned out to be an imaginary group that Difford had dreamed up in his bedroom. But once his lyric were paired with Tilbrook\u2019s tunes, their band struck pop gold. There have been ruptures and reconciliations since, and it was decades ago that they took up residency in the top 20 and 1981\u2019s East Side Story saw them talked about as the natural heirs to John Lennon and Paul McCartney. However, Squeeze\u2019s 2015 song Cradle to the Grave, the theme tune to Danny Baker\u2019s sitcom, explains the secret of their longevity. Tilbrook sings about not \u201cbeing a slave\u201d to past mistakes, and of defiantly fighting on: \u201cI won\u2019t go \u2019til I\u2019m ready.\u201d His band may be a much-loved institution rather than afforded the national treasure status granted the Kinks or Madness, but the vast Squeeze songbook documents a changing Britain as effectively as any historical drama. 1985\u2019s King George Street, among the lesser-played songs that, according to Tilbrook, deserve another airing, mentions council estates, \u201cfrom before they sold them off\u201d. Lately, Squeeze have become more political. Their merch stall donates to food banks and in 2016 Tilbrook spontaneously changed his lyrics on The Andrew Marr Show to rail against \u201cthe destruction of the welfare state\u201d under fellow guest David Cameron. That mischievous side surfaces here as well. There are audible gasps among some shockable punters when Tilbrook introduces Mumbo Jumbo as about \u201cbeing young, punk and full of spunk\u201d. Heaven knows what the more prudish present make of 2017\u2019s Please Be Upstanding, a beautifully sensitive song about erectile dysfunction that includes the line: \u201cTrying to balance in the air, with nothing but a dribble there.\u201d Otherwise, the Squeeze catalogue is so strong that they can dispense with a stone-cold classic such as Up the Junction \u2013 Difford\u2019s timeless tale of a young relationship wrecked by pregnancy, gambling and booze \u2013 five songs in. Another indecently early arrival, Pulling Musssels (from the Shell) is illustrated by images of runny ice creams, bags of chips and whelk stalls, lest anyone in the audience is too young to remember the 1970s British holiday. Where newer songs are brisk, the older ones are amphetamine punk fast. But unlike many bands of similar vintage, Squeeze aren\u2019t ready to slow down. 23 songs pile up in a 105-minute show that flies by.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson could be held in contempt by a Scottish court after he urged EU leaders to ignore a letter asking for an extension to the Brexit deadline. Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, and two other judges will hear allegations on Monday that the prime minister broke a promise he made to the court that he would not try to sabotage the request for an extension. The UK government\u2019s lawyers pledged in writing and in court this month that the prime minister would honour the provisions of the Benn act, seeking an extension to article 50 if he failed to get a Brexit deal passed by 19 October. The court needs to decide whether those pledges included not trying to frustrate that act, known in full as the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, by simultaneously asking for the extension request to be ignored. Carloway postponed a ruling at the first hearing of this case on 9 October, in part because the government\u2019s lawyers made \u201cdetailed and specific\u201d statements to uphold the law on Johnson\u2019s behalf. If the three judges find Johnson is in contempt, he could theoretically face a fine or even jail, but the court could suspend a ruling on sanctions to give the prime minister time to comply with its ruling. After losing a knife-edge Commons vote on Saturday on a delay to his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the act but also sent another personal letter to Brussels that explicitly asked EU leaders not to agree yet to an extension. Johnson is reported to have spoken privately to key EU figures on Saturday to make the same point, as he tries to buy extra time to force his deal through Westminster before the planned Brexit day on 31 October. Lawyers for three anti-Brexit campaigners are expected to argue on Monday that these steps are a clear breach of the government\u2019s promises to the court, made by lawyers acting on behalf of Lord Keen, the advocate general and the UK government\u2019s law officer for Scotland. The government objected to an application from those campaigners \u2013 Dale Vince, a green energy entrepreneur, Jolyon Maugham QC and Joanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP \u2013 for an interdict or injunction that would force the prime minister to stick to the Benn act\u2019s provisions. Acting on Keen\u2019s behalf, the government\u2019s lawyers told the court there was no need to issue an interdict because Johnson accepted \u201cthat he is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions\u201d. The submission repeatedly added that \u201cthe prime minister is subject to the law and, as would be expected of a minister of the crown, there is no question but that he will comply with the requirements of the law. He has repeatedly said so.\u201d Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the anti-Brexit campaigners\u2019 advocate, is expected to ask the judges to replay sections of a BBC recording of the first hearing on 9 October when government lawyers confirmed Johnson would not try to sabotage the Benn act\u2019s provisions. The government is expected to argue on Monday that Johnson honoured his promises to the court by sending the letter as required, and that it was lawful for him to simultaneously argue against an extension. However, David Johnston QC, one of the government\u2019s two QCs, told the court this month that Johnson knew he faced legal sanctions if he broke the law. \u201cI would have to accept that the court will be able to deal with that one way or another,\u201d he said. Maugham and his co-campaigners had originally asked the court to consider using its unique powers, known as nobile officium, to write that letter on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he failed to do so. That part of the case is now likely to be dropped. Maugham said it was up to Carloway and his fellow judges to consider now whether they felt the court had been misled about Johnson\u2019s plans to frustrate the act and, if so, what sanction should be imposed. \u201cThe court\u2019s role is to uphold the law,\u2013 not to act as parent to a stroppy child,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question of whether the prime minister is in contempt of court, as many commentators have argued, is really one for it.

      "bodyText": "When English National Opera presented the premiere of The Mask of Orpheus at the Coliseum in 1986, I doubt many of us in the audience thought we would have to wait 33 years to see it on stage again. In the meantime both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, other productions of what was acknowledged as the defining work of Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s early career and a landmark in 20th-century British opera, had regularly been promised, only for plans to be abandoned sooner or later, because of the sheer financial and technical challenges of realising them. But now this monumental work is back at the Coliseum, the centrepiece of ENO\u2019s Orpheus season. For that, at least, much thanks. Those who were not around to experience the work in 1986, or the concert staging performance at the Royal Festival Hall 10 years later, will need to catch this version, if only to experience the magnificence of much of the music, which is an immense achievement for conductor Martyn Brabbins and everyone else involved. But those who have fond memories of the original production, might be advised to stay away from what in most other respects is a travesty of what Birtwistle and his librettist Peter Zinovieff envisaged, and of what the work represents. The production is the work of ENO\u2019s departing artistic director Daniel Kramer, and let\u2019s hope it is the last of his shows to be seen there. For this is a wilful parade of self-indulgence, with set designs by Lizzie Clachan translating the action to a sleek modern apartment, and costumes by Daniel Lismore that might be more appropriate in a Rio carnival procession or on the Mexican Day of the Dead.

      "body": "<p>More than two hours into the Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday night, after discussions on healthcare, gun control and foreign policy, the moderators turned to another issue that sharply divided the candidates: is it time to break up Facebook?</p> <p>The question was framed slightly differently: is Elizabeth Warren right?</p> <p>Over the last year, the Massachusetts senator has been at the vanguard of the debate about breaking up big tech companies, helping move the issue on to the political agenda. In doing do, she has been drawn into sharp conflict with the company\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.</p> <p>The question went first to Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur.</p> <p>\u201cAs usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem,\u201d he replied, before laying out why he disagreed <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">with her plan</a> to break up the titans of the tech industry \u2013 Facebook, Google, Amazon \u2013 and regulate them more heavily.</p> <p>The candidates then grappled with the issue for the first time in a meaningful way during a presidential debate. From breaking up the the largest companies, to data privacy legislation, political fundraising in Silicon Valley and whether Donald Trump should be banned from Twitter, the discussion illustrated a deepening disenchantment with big tech \u2013 and why Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-big-tech-silicon-valley\">fears a Warren presidency would \u201csuck for us\u201d</a>.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018They\u2019re begging for regulation\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s comments, made to employees, were not meant to be made public. But their leak this month triggered a very public showdown between the fast-rising frontrunner for the Democratic nomination and one of the most powerful executives in the world \u2013 a fascinating subplot of the 2020 primary.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the one thing that the CEOs of these companies absolutely hate,\u201d said Sarah Miller, deputy director of the <a href=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org/\">Open Markets Institute</a>, a Washington-based thinktank that advocates against monopolies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019re begging for regulation because they know they game it, they know they can shape it, they know they can avoid it</p> <footer> <cite>Sarah Miller</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re begging for regulation because they know they game it, they know they can shape it, they know they can avoid it and they know that it will likely inhibit their competitors who won\u2019t have the same resources. But, more than anything, they do not want to be broken up.\u201d</p> <p>Warren wants to regulate tech platforms as utilities, targeting companies that earn $25bn or more in global annual revenue. She would appoint regulators to unwind \u201cillegal and anticompetitive tech mergers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies,\u201d she said, announcing her policy, \u201chave too much power \u2013 too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>According to audio recordings leaked to the Verge, Zuckerberg called Warren\u2019s plan an \u201cexistential\u201d threat.</p> <p>\u201cIf she gets elected president,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019,\u201d Warren <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1179023352742236160\">tweeted</a> in reply, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>The war of words escalated after Facebook\u2019s decision to allow Trump\u2019s re-election campaign run a $1m <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/technology/facebook-trump-biden-ad.html\">ad campaign</a> containing lies about Joe Biden. Warren responded by placing her own ad on Facebook.</p> <p>It started with Warren announcing \u201cBreaking News\u201d, before declaring that Zuckerberg and Facebook were supporting Trump\u2019s re-election. Warren then says, \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018How could this possibly be true?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>The point Warren was making is that by allowing her ad, Facebook was showing itself to be a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine\u201d.</p> <p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Cambridge Analytica scandal broke</a>, Zuckerberg has worked to smooth relationships with politicians in DC. But Warren seems in no mood to play nice. The two sparred again after Zuckerberg defended Facebook in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cWe can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,\u201d Zuckerberg said, speaking in the ornate Gaston Hall, where presidents and foreign dignitaries have delivered major addresses. \u201cOr we can decide the cost is simply too great. I\u2019m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d</p> <p>Warren\u2019s response was withering: \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Mark\u2019s power is un-American\u2019</h2> <p>Warren has taken the most aggressive posture toward big tech, part of a call for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d to the American economy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/08/elizabeth-warren-amazon-facebook-google-big-tech-break-up-blogpost\">After she introduc</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/08/elizabeth-warren-amazon-facebook-google-big-tech-break-up-blogpost\">ed her proposal</a> in March, her campaign put up a billboard near a busy transit station station in San Francisco that said in capital letters: \u201cBreak up big tech\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a8993d57065eb3aeb948a60f306ae6eef3451896\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8993d57065eb3aeb948a60f306ae6eef3451896/0_201_2968_1781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the latest debate, the Massachusetts senator announced that she would not take contributions of more than $200 from \u201cexecutives at big tech companies\u201d, even as employees of those companies <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/16/warren-tech-donations-debate-048194\">help power her campaign</a>.</p> <p>Warren has attracted an interesting ally: Chris Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg at Harvard. Last week, the organization he co-chairs, the Economic Security Project, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/17/facebook-co-founder-critic-chris-hughes-spearheads-million-anti-monopoly-fund/\">announced the creation</a> of a $10m \u201canti-monopoly fund\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?module=inline\">Writing in the New York Times</a> in May, Hughes said Zuckerberg\u2019s influence had far exceeded \u201canyone else in the private sector or government\u201d and said Facebook\u2019s concentration of wealth, power and influence \u2013 2.7bn people use it or its other platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, each month\u2013 posed a threat to democracy itself.</p> <p>\u201cMark\u2019s power is unprecedented and un-American,\u201d Hughes wrote. \u201cIt is time to break up Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who is now Facebook\u2019s vice-president for global affairs and communications, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/facebook-nick-clegg-chris-hughes.html\">responded</a> in the New York Times later that month: \u201cFacebook shouldn\u2019t be broken up \u2013 but it does need to be held to account. Anyone worried about the challenges we face in an online world should look at getting the rules of the internet right, not dismantling successful American companies.\u201d</p> <p>The drive to break up Facebook has plenty of critics who agree the company has too much power but do not believe such action would address many of the major concerns with the platform, including how to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-09/facebook-breakup-calls-need-more-thought\">strengthen</a> user privacy protections, <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/chris-hughes-facebook-antitrust-speech.html\">improve</a> election security and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer\">stop</a> propaganda intended to incite violence and extremism.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html\">Washington Post op-ed</a> earlier this year, shortly after Warren unveiled her plan, Zuckerberg called for \u201cupdating the rules of the internet\u201d and outlined four areas where he said new regulation was needed: \u201cHarmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to say to Facebook, 'We\u2019re going to treat you like a public utility, like AT&T or the electric company'</p> <footer> <cite>Dipayan Ghosh</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/05/dont-break-up-facebook-treat-it-like-a-utility\">has argued</a> breakup is not the only way to thwart Facebook\u2019s capacity for \u201ccapitalistic overreaches\u201d and \u201ceconomic exploitation\u201d. He favors a \u201cnovel, stringent\u201d set of \u201cpro-competition policies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to say to Facebook, \u2018We\u2019re going to treat you like a public utility, like AT&amp;T or the electric company,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cWe are going to make sure you can\u2019t make any mergers or acquisitions, we\u2019re going to tax you heavily, we are going to develop stringent privacy regulations that you\u2019re going to need to follow.\u201d</p> <p>There are those who argue Facebook should not be singled out by a president, as the former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said during the Democratic debate. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate antitrust subcommittee and another presidential contender, advocated for bolstering regulatory agencies to promote competition.</p> <p>The debate underscored a broad consensus: that tech companies wield far too much power and influence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that virtually all of these candidates are saying that there are a handful of tech companies that have too much power,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the <a href=\"https://ilsr.org/\">Institute for Local Self-Reliance</a>. \u201cIf you turn the clock back even just three years, the idea that that discussion would have happened would seem pretty far-fetched.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Dinners with lots of people\u2019</h2> <p>Silicon Valley has faced a reckoning in Washington since 2016. But the events of the past few weeks have sharpened the divide and pulled Zuckerberg far more publicly and personally into the political maelstrom.</p> <p>He is expected to <a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=404487\">testify on Capitol Hill </a>this week, for the first time since he faced a public grilling in April 2018 over the company\u2019s handling of user information, whether it should be more heavily regulated, alleged censorship of conservative content and the extent of Russian meddling. In the 18 months since, Democrats and Republicans have only grown more frustrated, setting the stage for another contentious hearing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning \u2026 I suggest you do!</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Zuckerberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Republicans have long alleged that Facebook silences conservative personalities and websites, charges the company denies. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/14/facebook-zuckerberg-conservatives-private-meetings-046663\">According to Politico</a>, Zuckerberg has hosted conservative lawmakers, commentators and journalists, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the radio host Hugh Hewitt, at his California home over the past several months.</p> <p>Zuckerberg appeared to confirm the report in a Facebook post, writing that he had \u201cdinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time.</p> <p>\u201cMeeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t tried it, I suggest you do!\u201d</p> <p>Regardless of who wins the White House in 2020, Facebook\u2019s political and legal woes show no sign of relenting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/meltdown-donald-trump-impeachment-pelosi-romney-mulvaney\">'Meltdown': Donald Trump and the impeachment week from hell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The audio of Zuckerberg leaked just weeks after state attorneys general from both parties opened an <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/ag-james-investigating-facebook-possible-antitrust-violations\">antitrust investigation</a>.</p> <p>This summer, Facebook agreed to pay a $5bn fine as part of a<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions\"> settlement</a> with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations in connection with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>.

The question was framed slightly differently: is Elizabeth Warren right? Over the last year, the Massachusetts senator has been at the vanguard of the debate about breaking up big tech companies, helping move the issue on to the political agenda. In doing do, she has been drawn into sharp conflict with the company\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. The question went first to Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur. \u201cAs usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem,\u201d he replied, before laying out why he disagreed with her plan to break up the titans of the tech industry \u2013 Facebook, Google, Amazon \u2013 and regulate them more heavily. The candidates then grappled with the issue for the first time in a meaningful way during a presidential debate. From breaking up the the largest companies, to data privacy legislation, political fundraising in Silicon Valley and whether Donald Trump should be banned from Twitter, the discussion illustrated a deepening disenchantment with big tech \u2013 and why Zuckerberg fears a Warren presidency would \u201csuck for us\u201d. \u2018They\u2019re begging for regulation\u2019 Zuckerberg\u2019s comments, made to employees, were not meant to be made public. But their leak this month triggered a very public showdown between the fast-rising frontrunner for the Democratic nomination and one of the most powerful executives in the world \u2013 a fascinating subplot of the 2020 primary. \u201cIt is the one thing that the CEOs of these companies absolutely hate,\u201d said Sarah Miller, deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a Washington-based thinktank that advocates against monopolies. \u201cThey\u2019re begging for regulation because they know they game it, they know they can shape it, they know they can avoid it and they know that it will likely inhibit their competitors who won\u2019t have the same resources. But, more than anything, they do not want to be broken up.\u201d Warren wants to regulate tech platforms as utilities, targeting companies that earn $25bn or more in global annual revenue. She would appoint regulators to unwind \u201cillegal and anticompetitive tech mergers\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies,\u201d she said, announcing her policy, \u201chave too much power \u2013 too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\u201d According to audio recordings leaked to the Verge, Zuckerberg called Warren\u2019s plan an \u201cexistential\u201d threat. \u201cIf she gets elected president,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u201d \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019,\u201d Warren tweeted in reply, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d The war of words escalated after Facebook\u2019s decision to allow Trump\u2019s re-election campaign run a $1m ad campaign containing lies about Joe Biden. Warren responded by placing her own ad on Facebook. It started with Warren announcing \u201cBreaking News\u201d, before declaring that Zuckerberg and Facebook were supporting Trump\u2019s re-election. Warren then says, \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018How could this possibly be true?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s not.\u201d The point Warren was making is that by allowing her ad, Facebook was showing itself to be a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine\u201d. Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Zuckerberg has worked to smooth relationships with politicians in DC. But Warren seems in no mood to play nice. The two sparred again after Zuckerberg defended Facebook in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington on Thursday. \u201cWe can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,\u201d Zuckerberg said, speaking in the ornate Gaston Hall, where presidents and foreign dignitaries have delivered major addresses. \u201cOr we can decide the cost is simply too great. I\u2019m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d Warren\u2019s response was withering: \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election.\u201d \u2018Mark\u2019s power is un-American\u2019 Warren has taken the most aggressive posture toward big tech, part of a call for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d to the American economy. After she introduced her proposal in March, her campaign put up a billboard near a busy transit station station in San Francisco that said in capital letters: \u201cBreak up big tech\u201d. Before the latest debate, the Massachusetts senator announced that she would not take contributions of more than $200 from \u201cexecutives at big tech companies\u201d, even as employees of those companies help power her campaign. Warren has attracted an interesting ally: Chris Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg at Harvard. Last week, the organization he co-chairs, the Economic Security Project, announced the creation of a $10m \u201canti-monopoly fund\u201d. Writing in the New York Times in May, Hughes said Zuckerberg\u2019s influence had far exceeded \u201canyone else in the private sector or government\u201d and said Facebook\u2019s concentration of wealth, power and influence \u2013 2.7bn people use it or its other platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, each month\u2013 posed a threat to democracy itself. \u201cMark\u2019s power is unprecedented and un-American,\u201d Hughes wrote. \u201cIt is time to break up Facebook.\u201d Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who is now Facebook\u2019s vice-president for global affairs and communications, responded in the New York Times later that month: \u201cFacebook shouldn\u2019t be broken up \u2013 but it does need to be held to account. Anyone worried about the challenges we face in an online world should look at getting the rules of the internet right, not dismantling successful American companies.\u201d The drive to break up Facebook has plenty of critics who agree the company has too much power but do not believe such action would address many of the major concerns with the platform, including how to strengthen user privacy protections, improve election security and stop propaganda intended to incite violence and extremism. In a Washington Post op-ed earlier this year, shortly after Warren unveiled her plan, Zuckerberg called for \u201cupdating the rules of the internet\u201d and outlined four areas where he said new regulation was needed: \u201cHarmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.\u201d Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, has argued breakup is not the only way to thwart Facebook\u2019s capacity for \u201ccapitalistic overreaches\u201d and \u201ceconomic exploitation\u201d. He favors a \u201cnovel, stringent\u201d set of \u201cpro-competition policies\u201d. \u201cWe need to say to Facebook, \u2018We\u2019re going to treat you like a public utility, like AT&amp;T or the electric company,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cWe are going to make sure you can\u2019t make any mergers or acquisitions, we\u2019re going to tax you heavily, we are going to develop stringent privacy regulations that you\u2019re going to need to follow.\u201d There are those who argue Facebook should not be singled out by a president, as the former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said during the Democratic debate. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate antitrust subcommittee and another presidential contender, advocated for bolstering regulatory agencies to promote competition. The debate underscored a broad consensus: that tech companies wield far too much power and influence. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that virtually all of these candidates are saying that there are a handful of tech companies that have too much power,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \u201cIf you turn the clock back even just three years, the idea that that discussion would have happened would seem pretty far-fetched.\u201d \u2018Dinners with lots of people\u2019 Silicon Valley has faced a reckoning in Washington since 2016. But the events of the past few weeks have sharpened the divide and pulled Zuckerberg far more publicly and personally into the political maelstrom. He is expected to testify on Capitol Hill this week, for the first time since he faced a public grilling in April 2018 over the company\u2019s handling of user information, whether it should be more heavily regulated, alleged censorship of conservative content and the extent of Russian meddling. In the 18 months since, Democrats and Republicans have only grown more frustrated, setting the stage for another contentious hearing. Republicans have long alleged that Facebook silences conservative personalities and websites, charges the company denies. According to Politico, Zuckerberg has hosted conservative lawmakers, commentators and journalists, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the radio host Hugh Hewitt, at his California home over the past several months. Zuckerberg appeared to confirm the report in a Facebook post, writing that he had \u201cdinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time. \u201cMeeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t tried it, I suggest you do!\u201d Regardless of who wins the White House in 2020, Facebook\u2019s political and legal woes show no sign of relenting. The audio of Zuckerberg leaked just weeks after state attorneys general from both parties opened an antitrust investigation. This summer, Facebook agreed to pay a $5bn fine as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The new settlement order requires Facebook to improve the way it handles its users\u2019 personal information and to designate an employee tasked with coordinating those efforts. Just last week, the Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a prominent critic of big tech, introduced a bill that would strengthen privacy protections and threaten to jail Silicon Valley executives who knowingly lie to the FTC. \u201cMark Zuckerberg won\u2019t take Americans\u2019 privacy seriously unless he feels personal consequences,\u201d Wyden said in a statement. \u201cA slap on the wrist from the FTC won\u2019t do the job, so under my bill he\u2019d face jail time for lying to the government.\u201d",

Within hours, in spite of the age difference between them, they are planning a life together: \u201cI\u2019ll know that whatever time you\u2019ve given me, my entire life\u2026 was all leading up to you.\u201d The second section finds Elio embarking on a new relationship with an older man, Michel, in a clear parallel to his father\u2019s relationship with Miranda. But Elio, a concert pianist, cannot silence the echo of his first great love, Oliver: \u201cso many years could go by and leave me still attached to someone who had become an invisible presence\u201d. Oliver himself, meanwhile, is in an unhappy marriage, ruminating over his love affair with Elio, and it is not until the last section that Aciman delivers their long-awaited, inevitable reunion. Find Me is an unashamedly romantic and philosophical novel. Characters fall in love with one another\u2019s discourse, with topics ranging from literature and music to notions of time, desire and fate: \u201ctime is always the price we pay for the unlived life\u201d. And yet Aciman manages, by immersing us in their emotional dynamics, to present this intellectual sparring without pretentiousness. Fathers \u2013 and their enduring influence \u2013 loom large. Miranda is the primary carer for her father; their relationship is devoid of the delusions that often cloud familial relationships. Likewise, Samuel\u2019s relationship with Elio is based on mutual love and respect: \u201cWe never had any secrets, you and I, you know about me, and I know about you. In this I consider myself the luckiest son on earth.\u201d Michel, Elio\u2019s lover, obsesses over his dead father, while in the novel\u2019s tender conclusion, Elio realises that fatherhood can come in many different guises. But at its core, Find Me is a study in love: not only the love we dare to embrace but the love that exists in the parallel lives we lack the courage to explore. \u2022 Find Me by Andr\u00e9 Aciman is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

He\u2019s got a work ethic second to none \u2013 he put himself in hospital when he was here, he worked that hard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who loves the game will get my support.

Hansen previously enjoyed similar close ties with the former Springboks coach Heyneke Meyer, often hosting midweek dinners when touring their respective nations. As the teams warmed up before Saturday\u2019s quarter-final Hansen and the Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, chatted animatedly in the middle of Tokyo Stadium for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Hansen has, however, also fired plenty of verbal barbs in his time. The departing Australia coach, Michael Cheika, has been on the receiving end on several occasions. So, too, the Wales and Lions coach Warren Gatland. Hansen claims these jibes are fun and games, part of the preliminary to the main theatre.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see some of the banter which is really only to help promote the game as being, \u2018Oh, these guys don\u2019t like each other\u2019, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoaches, regardless of whether you\u2019re playing against their team or not, go through the same emotions. You spend a lot of time in the same mental space. It\u2019s a game of footy, it\u2019s not life or death. The closer you are the more you communicate. It\u2019s like when you play against your brother or your sister: it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not life-threatening.</p> \n<p>\u201cRugby is a special game. Those of us that have been around long enough understand the game is bigger than everybody else. It\u2019s the game that\u2019s more important than all the coaches and players.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fef03be-90e4-4479-a966-6b06ac24f770\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Fixtures, tables and results</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/20/top-try-and-points-scorers-for-the-2019-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Top try and points scorers</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-stadium-guide\">Stadium guide</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-guide-to-the-referees\">Referee guide</a><br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Our latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute+sport/rugby-union\">minute-by-minute live reports</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\">Sign up to The Breakdown</a>, our free rugby union email newsletter</p>\n    <p><b>Team guides</b><br>Pool A: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-ireland-team-guide\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-japan-team-guide\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-russia-team-guide\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-samoa-team-guide\">Samoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-scotland-team-guide\">Scotland</a><br>Pool B: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-canada-team-guide\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-italy-team-guide\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-namibia-team-guide\">Namibia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-new-zealand-team-guide\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">South Africa</a><br>Pool C: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-argentina-team-guide\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">England</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-france-team-guide\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-team-guide\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-usa-team-guide\">USA</a><br>Pool D: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-team-guide\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fiji-team-guide\">Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-georgia-team-guide\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-uruguay-team-guide\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-wales-team-guide\">Wales</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOne of the greatest things about the game is the camaraderie not only in your own team but that you get from being involved in a contest and sharing those moments and then moving on to the next one.

      "bodyText": "Steve Hansen has revealed a deep respect his England counterpart, Eddie Jones, after the duo swapped messages as their tactical duel approaches. When England and New Zealand collide in Yokohama on Saturday for a first World Cup meeting since 1999 respect will be quickly set aside but whatever transpires, the content of the New Zealand head coach\u2019s text exchange with Jones suggests semi-final tensions will be left there. \u201cI said: \u2018Looking forward to seeing you and win, lose or draw we\u2019ll have a beer afterwards,\u2019\u201d Hansen added after New Zealand\u2019s 46-14 quarter-final victory over Ireland and as he began to focus on preparing for England. Hansen was happy to detail why he holds England\u2019s coach in such high regard. \u201cHis passion, he loves the game. He\u2019s got a work ethic second to none \u2013 he put himself in hospital when he was here, he worked that hard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who loves the game will get my support. He\u2019s done a fantastic job with England. They\u2019ve got a world record for most wins in Test rugby along with ourselves. They\u2019ve got a harder edge about them. \u201cEddie has been part of a winning World Cup team with South Africa [as assistant in 2007], he\u2019s had the disappointment of losing to England when he was coaching Australia [2003] but to get to the final is being successful anyway, even if you don\u2019t win it. He\u2019s got to the ability to understand what\u2019s coming and he\u2019ll share those with his coaching and playing group.\u201d Hansen shares similar relationships with other coaches throughout the rugby world, formed during his 17-year career on the Test scene. Before the All Blacks crushed Ireland Hansen caught up with the Ireland defence coach, Andy Farrell. Hansen previously enjoyed similar close ties with the former Springboks coach Heyneke Meyer, often hosting midweek dinners when touring their respective nations. As the teams warmed up before Saturday\u2019s quarter-final Hansen and the Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, chatted animatedly in the middle of Tokyo Stadium for 10 minutes. Hansen has, however, also fired plenty of verbal barbs in his time. The departing Australia coach, Michael Cheika, has been on the receiving end on several occasions. So, too, the Wales and Lions coach Warren Gatland. Hansen claims these jibes are fun and games, part of the preliminary to the main theatre. \u201cYou see some of the banter which is really only to help promote the game as being, \u2018Oh, these guys don\u2019t like each other\u2019, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. \u201cCoaches, regardless of whether you\u2019re playing against their team or not, go through the same emotions. You spend a lot of time in the same mental space. It\u2019s a game of footy, it\u2019s not life or death. The closer you are the more you communicate. It\u2019s like when you play against your brother or your sister: it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not life-threatening. \u201cRugby is a special game. Those of us that have been around long enough understand the game is bigger than everybody else. It\u2019s the game that\u2019s more important than all the coaches and players. \u201cOne of the greatest things about the game is the camaraderie not only in your own team but that you get from being involved in a contest and sharing those moments and then moving on to the next one. The game has been professional for a while but if you look back teams always shared those moments after Tests together. It\u2019s something that is really important that we don\u2019t lose.\u201d The All Blacks suffered one minor injury blow against Ireland with the openside flanker, Matt Todd, aggravating a troublesome shoulder complaint. Hansen indicated he was unlikely to recover for England, which could pave the way for the bigger physical presence of Shannon Frizell, the more traditional blindside option, to take a spot on the bench.",

      "body": "<p>In 2008, Jenna Myers Karvunidis was pregnant and itching to throw a party. \u201cLife is hard, but I like to have fun,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to mark moments of joy.\u201d Karvunidis (who loves celebrating so much that she baked a cake for her goldfish\u2019s birthday) was determined to get her family \u201cjazzed up\u201d about her first baby. After the recent, much-anticipated birth of her nephew, her husband\u2019s family were less excited about this next grandchild and, with her own family emotionally and physically distant, Karvunidis came up with the then-novel idea of a theatrical reveal of her baby\u2019s sex.</p> <p>During their 20-week ultrasound scan she asked her midwife to keep quiet about whether the baby was a boy or girl and, instead of telling the expectant couple in person, the bemused professional sealed a note containing the secret in an envelope. Karvunidis then baked two cakes in the shape of ducklings, filling one with pink icing and the other with blue \u2013 a discrete toothpick for differentiation.</p> <p>Her family took some convincing to gather for a midweek party without apparent purpose, but as soon as the butter-cream duckling showed its contents \u2013 pink for a girl \u2013 everything changed. There were gasps, tears and someone shrieked: \u201cI feel like she\u2019s been born!\u201d In that moment the cake and the party did all Karvunidis had hoped to bring her pregnancy to life.</p> <p>The arrival of Bianca (the eldest of Karvunidis\u2019s three daughters) was still months away, but that day she did unwittingly birth something: the gender-reveal party. Her blog about the event was picked up by a popular magazine found in the waiting rooms of midwives and obstetricians in the area. The story spread through midwest America and then far beyond, becoming a mainstream part of US pregnancies and taking an increasing share of the $200-$1,000 US couples spend on their baby showers.</p> <p><em><strong>The popularity of</strong></em> elaborate, emotive gender-reveal videos on social media may have helped spread the trend to the UK. John Lewis stocks a gender-reveal party balloon and online retailers offer products from confetti blasters to personalised sweets and scratch cards. Celebrities have also acted as inspiration. In an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/katehudson/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> video last year, announcing her third pregnancy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/28/features.features11\" title=\"\">Kate Hudson</a>, her husband and sons simultaneously pop a number of balloons, spilling pink streamers and confetti on to the grass. The family jumps up and down hysterically, screaming with delight and hugging each other as a cloud of pink drifts skywards.</p> <p>Karvunidis is far from happy about what she unleashed. In late July this year, responding to questions on Twitter about her role in the gender-reveal phenomenon, she confessed to \u201cmajor mixed feelings\u201d and posted a family photograph featuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/26/gender-reveal-party-pioneer-regrets-trend\" title=\"\">Bianca</a>, the world\u2019s first gender-revealed baby, dressed in a suit. Striking a strong pose with her hands in her pockets, Bianca was sporting what conservative media outlets would describe as an \u201candrogynous\u201d haircut.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Karvunidis feels that \u2018aggressive energy\u2019 is caught up in the ritual</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The story spread like wildfire: like the Arizona wildfire which last year destroyed 47,000 acres of forest, at a cost of $8m. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/29/gender-reveal-stunt-boy-girl-pink-blue\" title=\"\">Dennis Dickey</a>, an off-duty border patrol agent, started the blaze with his gender-reveal stunt: shooting at a rectangular target marked \u201cBoy or girl\u201d, which exploded into blue smoke before setting grasslands alight. It\u2019s not just the environmental recklessness of Dickey\u2019s reveal, and the increasing popularity of expensive and dangerous stunts, that bothers Karvunidis. She\u2019s also concerned about what she calls \u201caggressive energy\u201d being so caught up with the sex of a foetus. \u201cWhen you announce your son with a gunshot, or by wrestling an alligator, I think, how far are we going to take this?\u201d</p> <p>As a lifelong feminist, who has recently started law school, her unease about gender-reveals started soon after they began to take off \u2013 she felt the idea was becoming politicised by conservative forces. \u201cI feel like the guy who invented gunpowder,\u201d she half-jokes.

      "bodyText": "In 2008, Jenna Myers Karvunidis was pregnant and itching to throw a party. \u201cLife is hard, but I like to have fun,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to mark moments of joy.\u201d Karvunidis (who loves celebrating so much that she baked a cake for her goldfish\u2019s birthday) was determined to get her family \u201cjazzed up\u201d about her first baby. After the recent, much-anticipated birth of her nephew, her husband\u2019s family were less excited about this next grandchild and, with her own family emotionally and physically distant, Karvunidis came up with the then-novel idea of a theatrical reveal of her baby\u2019s sex. During their 20-week ultrasound scan she asked her midwife to keep quiet about whether the baby was a boy or girl and, instead of telling the expectant couple in person, the bemused professional sealed a note containing the secret in an envelope. Karvunidis then baked two cakes in the shape of ducklings, filling one with pink icing and the other with blue \u2013 a discrete toothpick for differentiation. Her family took some convincing to gather for a midweek party without apparent purpose, but as soon as the butter-cream duckling showed its contents \u2013 pink for a girl \u2013 everything changed. There were gasps, tears and someone shrieked: \u201cI feel like she\u2019s been born!\u201d In that moment the cake and the party did all Karvunidis had hoped to bring her pregnancy to life. The arrival of Bianca (the eldest of Karvunidis\u2019s three daughters) was still months away, but that day she did unwittingly birth something: the gender-reveal party. Her blog about the event was picked up by a popular magazine found in the waiting rooms of midwives and obstetricians in the area. The story spread through midwest America and then far beyond, becoming a mainstream part of US pregnancies and taking an increasing share of the $200-$1,000 US couples spend on their baby showers. The popularity of elaborate, emotive gender-reveal videos on social media may have helped spread the trend to the UK. John Lewis stocks a gender-reveal party balloon and online retailers offer products from confetti blasters to personalised sweets and scratch cards. Celebrities have also acted as inspiration. In an Instagram video last year, announcing her third pregnancy, Kate Hudson, her husband and sons simultaneously pop a number of balloons, spilling pink streamers and confetti on to the grass. The family jumps up and down hysterically, screaming with delight and hugging each other as a cloud of pink drifts skywards. Karvunidis is far from happy about what she unleashed. In late July this year, responding to questions on Twitter about her role in the gender-reveal phenomenon, she confessed to \u201cmajor mixed feelings\u201d and posted a family photograph featuring Bianca, the world\u2019s first gender-revealed baby, dressed in a suit. Striking a strong pose with her hands in her pockets, Bianca was sporting what conservative media outlets would describe as an \u201candrogynous\u201d haircut. The story spread like wildfire: like the Arizona wildfire which last year destroyed 47,000 acres of forest, at a cost of $8m. Dennis Dickey, an off-duty border patrol agent, started the blaze with his gender-reveal stunt: shooting at a rectangular target marked \u201cBoy or girl\u201d, which exploded into blue smoke before setting grasslands alight. It\u2019s not just the environmental recklessness of Dickey\u2019s reveal, and the increasing popularity of expensive and dangerous stunts, that bothers Karvunidis. She\u2019s also concerned about what she calls \u201caggressive energy\u201d being so caught up with the sex of a foetus. \u201cWhen you announce your son with a gunshot, or by wrestling an alligator, I think, how far are we going to take this?\u201d As a lifelong feminist, who has recently started law school, her unease about gender-reveals started soon after they began to take off \u2013 she felt the idea was becoming politicised by conservative forces. \u201cI feel like the guy who invented gunpowder,\u201d she half-jokes. Though Karvunidis accepts that the idea may have emerged, with or without her, from the cultural soup that surrounds pregnancy, she does feel some guilt. \u201cI\u2019m the one who put the form to it. I\u2019m the one who said: \u2018This is something we\u2019re going to celebrate now, and this is how we\u2019re going to do it\u2019. I put it out there.\u201d Though Karvunidis\u2019s instincts led her to reject the gender-reveal shortly after she created it, it was her daughters\u2019 experiences of modern American girlhood that solidified her views. Karvunidis explains that she\u2019s always tried to model to her children that there should be no limits on what women can do. \u201cI\u2019ve gone back to school, I started a business and I try to be that person \u2013 the boss \u2013 so that it\u2019s totally normalised for them.\u201d But as Bianca has grown older she\u2019s been busy giving her mother an education in gender politics. Karvunidis\u2019s eldest is still just 10, uses she/her pronouns and considers herself a girl, but she\u2019s firmly rejected the idea that girls should dress or act a certain way and questions preconceived ideas about what gender means \u2013 something her parents have fully supported her in. \u201cBianca tells me there are more than two genders and many sexualities. I hadn\u2019t considered all this before.\u201d Thanks to Bianca, who Karvunidis calls a \u201cbad-ass\u201d, she is now concerned that the parties she helped make popular are hurting trans and non-binary communities, a position shared by the many activists who have supported her stance. \u201cAt least when the child is born you are getting all the information at once: the sex, the colour of their hair, who they look like, how long they are, what their heart rate is.

He has four children with the model and <em>Strictly</em> star Abbey Clancy.</p> <p><strong>You retired this summer. How\u2019s life after football?</strong><br>I feel good. I\u2019ve trained every day of my life since I left school at 16, so that\u2019s 20-odd years of being told where to be and what to do and what to wear. So I\u2019ve had a bit of a break and just thrown myself into other things. Yeah, I\u2019m still on a big holiday really.</p> <p><strong>Your podcast and books have been phenomenally successful. Why do you think that is? </strong><br>I don\u2019t know. I had the best job in the world and I like to think that I made the most of that and enjoyed it. But I look at players these days and I think sometimes they take themselves a bit too seriously and they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re enjoying it. So maybe I don\u2019t take myself too seriously in a world that does take itself too seriously and that\u2019s what people enjoy.</p> <p><strong>There are some amazing stories in your new book about how mollycoddled footballers are. When you go on away trips, you hand your passports in days before, so you don\u2019t forget them. You\u2019re not expected to pack phone chargers or even a pair of underpants</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>Everything\u2019s taken care of as a footballer, so that\u2019s probably the difference now. But I\u2019m not stupid; I can bring my own passport to the airport!</p> <p><strong>You write about how any footballer who took a book on trips would be looked at suspiciously. Is it changing at all?</strong><br>Er, no. I don\u2019t see many books. When I was at Liverpool, Jamie Carragher used to read an autobiography on every away trip, but he just loves football that much: it was Cruyff, Pel\u00e9, Maradona, Keane, Ferguson\u2026 But there\u2019s not too many into novels.</p> <p><strong>How about you \u2013 do you read m</strong><strong>any books?</strong><br>The last I read was Ant Middleton\u2019s book. Only because I met him and me and him were competing for top spot [on the bestsellers chart]. So I read all the competition. I read [Yuval Noah] Harari \u2013 he wrote <em>Sapiens</em> and all that. And I read Michelle Obama. Well, we blew her out of the water, Michelle Obama.</p> <p><strong>Must admit, I was surprised to learn that when you were at Stoke City you spent much of your downtime with your team</strong><strong>mates playing Trivial Pursuit\u2026</strong><br>I loved it, honestly couldn\u2019t get enough of it. We played it on the coach on the way to matches and then in the hotel every moment\u2026 One game could take a while! But God, what Charlie Adam doesn\u2019t know about animals. Unbelievable. My forte was sport or geography. A bit of history. But if you got the arts and literature segment, you\u2019d won.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s a memorable story in the book about meeting </strong><strong>Mickey Rourke</strong><strong> in Miami in 2006, when you went on holiday with friends after the World Cup\u2026</strong><br>We were out and I was like: \u201cOh, there\u2019s Mickey Rourke.\u201d And he was like: \u201cOh, you\u2019re robot boy!\u201d I\u2019ve got a picture somewhere of me and him doing the robot together in Miami. I\u2019ll find it one day. It was great, we had two amazing nights [with him]. But I was on a lads\u2019 holiday \u2013 he lived out there, that was his life! So the third one he knocked on our bedroom door and I peeked through [the peephole] and went: \u201cLads, it\u2019s Mickey Rourke.\u201d And they went: \u201cAh, fucking bin him. Get rid.\u201d So I pretended I wasn\u2019t in and went back to bed. He slipped a letter under the door and it was like: \u201cLet\u2019s meet here for dinner.\u201d And I literally left it in the hotel room. I didn\u2019t even bring the letter home to show anyone. Nuts. I wish I had it now, obviously.</p> <p><strong>On the subject of weird exchanges, you recall how</strong><strong> Prince Harry came over to you in the England dressing room and </strong><strong>asked</strong><strong>: \u201cHow did </strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong> bag Abbey?\u201d</strong><br>That shocked me. It did shock me, that one, took me by surprise. I didn\u2019t have a comeback.</p> <p><strong>You have four kids now \u2013 do you feel outnumbered?</strong><br>Yeah, I often say that you have to go from man-to-man to zonal marking. It\u2019s carnage, but it\u2019s great. We\u2019ve got two girls and two boys and I feel blessed. I\u2019m knackered now, I\u2019ll be honest, because I was up at four in the morning feeding the little one. But the girls are great, they help out.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve hinted that you would like to go into management. Why would you do that when everything\u2019s going so well?</strong><br>Yeah, I am tempted. I did the book and then the podcast and everything took off, but football doesn\u2019t leave you. Like I say, I\u2019ve been doing it every day since I was 16. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known, so there\u2019s got to be some part of me missing. So one day maybe, but I\u2019m looking forward to having Christmas for the first time this year. I literally haven\u2019t had a Christmas since I was a kid.

There are some amazing stories in your new book about how mollycoddled footballers are. When you go on away trips, you hand your passports in days before, so you don\u2019t forget them. You\u2019re not expected to pack phone chargers or even a pair of underpants\u2026 Everything\u2019s taken care of as a footballer, so that\u2019s probably the difference now. But I\u2019m not stupid; I can bring my own passport to the airport! You write about how any footballer who took a book on trips would be looked at suspiciously. Is it changing at all? Er, no. I don\u2019t see many books. When I was at Liverpool, Jamie Carragher used to read an autobiography on every away trip, but he just loves football that much: it was Cruyff, Pel\u00e9, Maradona, Keane, Ferguson\u2026 But there\u2019s not too many into novels. How about you \u2013 do you read many books? The last I read was Ant Middleton\u2019s book. Only because I met him and me and him were competing for top spot [on the bestsellers chart]. So I read all the competition. I read [Yuval Noah] Harari \u2013 he wrote Sapiens and all that. And I read Michelle Obama. Well, we blew her out of the water, Michelle Obama. Must admit, I was surprised to learn that when you were at Stoke City you spent much of your downtime with your teammates playing Trivial Pursuit\u2026 I loved it, honestly couldn\u2019t get enough of it. We played it on the coach on the way to matches and then in the hotel every moment\u2026 One game could take a while! But God, what Charlie Adam doesn\u2019t know about animals. Unbelievable. My forte was sport or geography. A bit of history. But if you got the arts and literature segment, you\u2019d won. There\u2019s a memorable story in the book about meeting Mickey Rourke in Miami in 2006, when you went on holiday with friends after the World Cup\u2026 We were out and I was like: \u201cOh, there\u2019s Mickey Rourke.\u201d And he was like: \u201cOh, you\u2019re robot boy!\u201d I\u2019ve got a picture somewhere of me and him doing the robot together in Miami. I\u2019ll find it one day. It was great, we had two amazing nights [with him]. But I was on a lads\u2019 holiday \u2013 he lived out there, that was his life! So the third one he knocked on our bedroom door and I peeked through [the peephole] and went: \u201cLads, it\u2019s Mickey Rourke.\u201d And they went: \u201cAh, fucking bin him. Get rid.\u201d So I pretended I wasn\u2019t in and went back to bed. He slipped a letter under the door and it was like: \u201cLet\u2019s meet here for dinner.\u201d And I literally left it in the hotel room. I didn\u2019t even bring the letter home to show anyone. Nuts. I wish I had it now, obviously. On the subject of weird exchanges, you recall how Prince Harry came over to you in the England dressing room and asked: \u201cHow did you bag Abbey?\u201d That shocked me. It did shock me, that one, took me by surprise. I didn\u2019t have a comeback. You have four kids now \u2013 do you feel outnumbered? Yeah, I often say that you have to go from man-to-man to zonal marking. It\u2019s carnage, but it\u2019s great. We\u2019ve got two girls and two boys and I feel blessed. I\u2019m knackered now, I\u2019ll be honest, because I was up at four in the morning feeding the little one. But the girls are great, they help out. You\u2019ve hinted that you would like to go into management. Why would you do that when everything\u2019s going so well? Yeah, I am tempted. I did the book and then the podcast and everything took off, but football doesn\u2019t leave you. Like I say, I\u2019ve been doing it every day since I was 16. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known, so there\u2019s got to be some part of me missing. So one day maybe, but I\u2019m looking forward to having Christmas for the first time this year. I literally haven\u2019t had a Christmas since I was a kid. And if I was managing, I wouldn\u2019t have that. \u2022 I, Robot: How to be a Footballer 2 by Peter Crouch is published by Ebury (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>Michael Stipe pops his head around a pillar. \u201cHello! It\u2019s Michael!\u201d he says, though we\u2019ve met before and he\u2019s very famous. It\u2019s early evening and we\u2019re in the lobby of Stipe\u2019s London hotel, two minutes\u2019 walk from the Extinction Rebellion protest in Trafalgar Square. All is shiny, stately and calm, though we can hear the occasional police helicopter above our heads. This pleases Stipe. He\u2019s a supporter of the protest; in fact he\u2019s just released his first solo single, <a href=\"https://michaelstipe.com/#\" title=\"\">Your Capricious Soul</a>, with a pay-as-much-as-you-like price tag, all monies going to Extinction Rebellion.</p> <p>\u201cI mean,\u201d he says, \u201cI came into London today, and I can\u2019t think of a better excuse to be late for a meeting than a bunch of people who are literally looking at the end of us \u2013 and we\u2019re taking a bunch of species with us if we go \u2013 and trying to do something about it \u2026 Oh! Have one of these!\u201d He digs into his bag and gives me his own specially designed XR sticker.</p> <p>We take the stairs to his suite \u2013 \u201cI asked for a small room,\u201d he says, laughing at himself, \u201cbut they insisted\u201d \u2013 where Stipe fiddles expertly with the coffee machine and shows me how he likes to slice a pear. \u201cYou cut it like this, and then you can stand the core up on a plate, like a column. Then you photograph it from all sides and animate the images, so it looks like the column is spinning,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Stipe, as you can tell, is not your usual pop star. In fact, he\u2019s not really a pop star at all these days, though he\u2019s working on solo material, occasionally produces other bands, such as Fischerspooner, and is still best known as the singer in REM. Now 59, slight and neat, he has the hard-to-pin-down feel of a much younger person. There\u2019s no weight about him, no sense of him becoming settled in his ways. Instead, he reminds me of a curious faun: skittery, friendly, interested but naturally shy. He\u2019s a talker, but he\u2019s not dominant; he doesn\u2019t swamp you with big ego charisma, though he\u2019s utterly charming. How astonishing that he became so famous, I think. You wouldn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d be able to bear it, despite his ease in a suite. Instead of a lead singer, Stipe has the air of an artist, regarding the world from unusual angles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a82c139a3b18044181de72ca51fad58038c24dbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82c139a3b18044181de72ca51fad58038c24dbf/0_0_5256_3496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stipe at the launch of Our Interference Times: A Visual Record in Berlin earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stipe at the launch of Our Interference Times: A Visual Record in Berlin earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Berry/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And actually, since REM split, in 2011, Stipe has been just this, making installations and video work, sculpture and photography. He filmed his first artistic mentor, Jeremy Ayers, dancing for seven minutes, then set it to house music composed on a Moog. He makes books and experimental sculptures in his studio in New York, where he lives with his long-term partner, Thomas (pronounced Tohma) Dozol, who\u2019s also a photographer. In fact, in the years since REM, Stipe has been quite at ease with exploring his art, with not performing. \u201cIt feels like the real me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m working in all these different mediums and it makes sense.\u201d At one point he grew the most enormous wild man beard, though it\u2019s trimmed short today. He wears a green polo shirt, jeans, green socks and a beautiful large gold ring on his left hand.</p> <p>Stipe is in London as part of a short promotional tour, with a double set of duties. It\u2019s the 25th anniversary of <a href=\"https://store.craftrecordings.com/collections/r-e-m\" title=\"\">REM\u2019s <em>Monster</em></a>, and there\u2019s a special box set coming out, so he\u2019s been chatting about that to journalists, alongside REM musicians Peter Buck and Mike Mills. Separately, he\u2019s also here to discuss his new book of photographs, the second in a series made in collaboration with other people. The first, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Michael-Stipe-1/dp/8862085915\" title=\"\"><em>Volume 1</em></a>, came out last year: it featured just 35 photographs and was made with artist/curator Jonathan Berger. The second, <em>Our Interference Times: A Visual Record</em>, with writer Douglas Coupland, has just been published. And it\u2019s <em>Interference Times</em> that we\u2019re here to contemplate. We put the book on the table, open it at page one\u2026 \u201cA window,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cIn black and white. And kind of shitty, like a shitty cellphone picture. Every image after this is colour, like boom, here we are in real life. Or fantasy life. It\u2019s basically the mind of Michael.\u201d</p> <p>O<em>ur Interference Times</em> is a far weightier tome than <em>Volume 1</em>, and has a different tone. <em>Volume 1</em> played with ideas of celebrity, intimacy and family, showcasing snaps of a young River Phoenix in the back of a car, of Kurt Cobain\u2019s hands. There were also a couple of pictures, not taken by Stipe, but owned by him, of James Dean, of Marilyn Monroe as a baby, and an outrageous <em>Esquire</em> dinner party at the former New York nightclub Studio 54 featuring Andy Warhol and Donald Trump. I interviewed Stipe onstage at the ICA about Volume 1 last year: we noted that few of the portraits showed people looking straight at the camera. Stipe is too offbeat, too wary for that.</p> <p>The new book is less densely populated, though there are pictures of people, and those without humans show evidence of our interference with nature\u2019s design. Stipe talks about one, which seems to be there to deliberately annoy neat freaks. It\u2019s a picture of a manhole cover, a pavement and a fence. None of them fit together properly. It\u2019s maddening \u2026 though Stipe sees it differently.</p> <p>\u201cYou have these striations from a natural material, made into concrete,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have these stones laid out as a mosaic, a manhole cover. And then a tree that\u2019s been cut into slabs. It\u2019s man attempting to create order from chaos. A lot of the book is really about that old waltz between man and nature.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc894f6ee774d9124b8f471f73baac8609339dc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc894f6ee774d9124b8f471f73baac8609339dc1/0_0_1333_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fountain, Nimes, by Michael Stipe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fountain, Nimes, by Michael Stipe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Copyright: Michael Stipe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Actually, there are a lot of regimented grids in the book, though these are often out of whack, or they\u2019re details of something that you can\u2019t quite work out, that you think is something different. On more than one occasion, you find yourself turning your head, wondering: What IS that?, until you see. Photographs are laid out to play off each other, with one almost chatting to its facing companion. For instance, here\u2019s a photograph of a naked, painted man\u2026 \u201cI painted him,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cI took the picture from on top of a ladder, he\u2019s lying on the studio floor. I turned it upside down, so he looks like Icarus falling from the sky.\u201d Opposite this floating, delicate figure is a shot of a heavy marble statue of Hermes fastening his sandal, which Stipe saw in Versailles. The contrast between the fluidity and solidity enhances both.</p> <p>Often what Stipe and Coupland, who are old friends, were interested in \u2013 especially Stipe \u2013 is the interaction between our old analogue lives and our new digital ones. There are many photographs of photographs: mobile-phone snaps of a computer screen displaying an older picture created with a film camera. Stipe is fascinated with how this doesn\u2019t really work, how the different media don\u2019t talk to each other very well, even though they\u2019re essentially doing the same thing. The pixels shudder, the focus is kaput. He\u2019s interested in how the past and future are overlapping, but ineptly, inelegantly. Does this mean that the past was better? After all, this is a book he\u2019s promoting, not a computer game, and one for which he spent a lot of time getting the details right. He wanted the images to bleed right out to the edges, he wanted the pages to only be numbered once in every five. When I mention that I love how the book smells (like old books), he\u2019s really chuffed: he was careful to choose a particular ink, with a particularly pleasing aroma. \u201cI like that the book is an artefact,\u201d he says. \u201cTen years ago, I did a whole series of pieces about books, because we all thought that books were going away and we\u2019d all be looking at everything backlit from now on. But we were wrong.\u201d</p> <p>One of the shots is of his lyrics to Hope, from <em>Up</em>, and Stipe mentions that the song is about a man trying to save his own life by turning to a seemingly ridiculous experimental medical procedure (injecting himself with alligator DNA). He connects it to this same analogue-meets-digital feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9397b7ddd05c35a83244b0b4fc7dbb63418fbd39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9397b7ddd05c35a83244b0b4fc7dbb63418fbd39/384_0_2379_2379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Stipe, Douglas Coupland and Jeff Koons ata New York art show in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Stipe, Douglas Coupland and Jeff Koons ata New York art show in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis weird 30-year period that we\u2019re in,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, I think it\u2019s going to be 40 years \u2013 until the next shoe drops, when it\u2019s like: \u2018Holy fuck, where are we?\u2019 The next shoe dropping will be something mad like a world leader announcing: \u2018Yes, in fact we are living among aliens, or they are living among us. And we\u2019ve known it for 80 years and we didn\u2019t tell you because we thought it would freak you out.\u2019 Or, the next shoe dropping is another Fukushima, but on a grander scale. Or it\u2019s that medical research advances so quickly that suddenly there\u2019s a cure for everything, but you have to be a billionaire to be able to afford it.\u201d</p> <p>What he means, I think, is that the future is amazing and terrifying, and almost upon us: how are we dealing with it? How is it changing us? He wonders about social media. He used to post pictures on Instagram, and there was a time when he\u2019d put up selfies taken with famous people, but cut the other famous person out of frame, just leaving himself, grinning like a loon. \u201cYes, cutting Salman Rushdie\u2019s face in half, or Patti Smith, or Tilda Swinton or Sofia Coppola. With me laughing or smiling in that centre. I thought it was funny.\u201d He\u2019s stopped now, moved his Instagram to private, and has no Twitter presence at all. At one point last year, his website was just a series of mad moving images, though now it\u2019s promoting Your Capricious Soul.</p> <p>He\u2019s not frightened of the future; he\u2019s just interested.</p> <p>\u201cVisually, with digital technology we\u2019re actually coming closer to nature,\u201d he says, \u201cIf you look at anything natural under a microscope, it breaks down into fractals. And we are now looking at the world in fractals, through pixels, rather than a halftone, which is how we used to see images with print.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe has taken thousands of photographs in his time: about 37,000, he thinks, kept in \u201ca house\u201d and in storage facilities. He\u2019s a massive hoarder (when he puts on a jumper later, he mentions that it\u2019s one that he bought in the 1990s, and found the other day when going through a storage container), and he started photography young, taking a course when he was 13, then studying photography and painting at the University of Georgia before leaving to form REM. And he often used his training and art sensibilities while in the band \u2013 directing videos, overlooking graphics and stage design. His photographs became LP covers, and he used his camera as a diary when touring. Despite all this, he says that he would have preferred to have been a fine artist, but he doesn\u2019t like his drawing line. In<em> Our Interference Times</em>, there\u2019s some of his drawing near the front \u2013 a profile, drawn when he was very young, some school work, a copy of some graphic writing. \u201cI liked how it looked, which is very unusual for me,\u201d he says. There\u2019s also a picture of a smashed lightbulb, representing an incident that happened when Stipe was three years old.</p> <p>\u201cI bit into a lightbulb because I wanted to be the filament,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the only way that I knew to get inside was to bite through. So I did. My father and my uncle got the glass out of my mouth, they got some glue, and they put the lightbulb back together to make sure I hadn\u2019t swallowed any glass. I distinctly remember doing it. The desire to be the filament\u2026\u201d</p> <p>To become the light? I say. That\u2019s an easy metaphor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f511a75b28e1dfae80aca6a926483c9aa24c7158\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f511a75b28e1dfae80aca6a926483c9aa24c7158/0_0_2657_3543/750.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Stipe's photograph of a Fotoautomat in Arles.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fotoautomat, Arles: \u2018The thing about digital technology \u2013 and social media, certainly \u2013 is that it\u2019s changing the way we see ourselves\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Michael Stipe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, I was a year out of scarlet fever,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cI had scarlet fever as a two-year-old and it boils your brain. You use your synapses differently. And that\u2019s become part of my mythology of myself, and I go along with it. I do think differently and I know that. I\u2019m neither synesthetic nor on the spectrum, but there are similarities. I talk differently, I know!\u201d</p> <p>Stipe\u2019s phone buzzes: his friends, fashion designer Erdem and Erdem\u2019s sister, Sara, a documentary maker, are in the lobby. They\u2019re going for dinner, but Stipe has something he wants to say first.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about people that are trying to eliminate or delete or get rid of the mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, no, no, no wait, that\u2019s where brilliance lives. That\u2019s where instinct lives. That\u2019s where God lives. That\u2019s the spark. You know, when the book was printed, I looked at it, and I got halfway through and I was like: \u2018This is such a weird book. It\u2019s so weird.\u2019 I\u2019d thought, as I used to do with my lyric writing, I thought I was being so clear and so obvious and actually overstating my points. Overdoing it, really. But actually, the book is weird. It might take a bit of work, but I feel like if you go from beginning to end and you close the book, you might look up and see something a little bit differently than you had before.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe puts on a beanie hat, and his 90s jumper, and we go down to the lobby. He wants to check on the Extinction Rebellion protest before dinner. Erdem is a bit worried \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like crowds, in case they turn nasty \u2013 but we all walk to Trafalgar Square, to wander between the tents and the flags, to dart through the crowd around an anarcho-rap band, the people queuing for vegan curry. It\u2019s like the Green Fields at Glastonbury. And Stipe is utterly at home, moving swiftly between everyone, always looking, never stopping. I leave him there, in the dark, completely happy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Michael-Stipe-Interference-visual-record/dp/8862086784/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CKOISRNFY1RO&amp;keywords=our+interference+times&amp;qid=1571224700&amp;sprefix=our+inter%2Caps%2C127&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\"><em>Our Interference Times: A Visual Record</em></a><em> by Michael Stipe with Douglas Coupland is published by Damiani</em><em> (\u00a345)</em><em>. </em><a href=\"https://michaelstipe.com/#\" title=\"\"><em>Michael Stipe\u2019s Your Capricious Soul is available to download now</em></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Stipe pops his head around a pillar. \u201cHello! It\u2019s Michael!\u201d he says, though we\u2019ve met before and he\u2019s very famous. It\u2019s early evening and we\u2019re in the lobby of Stipe\u2019s London hotel, two minutes\u2019 walk from the Extinction Rebellion protest in Trafalgar Square. All is shiny, stately and calm, though we can hear the occasional police helicopter above our heads. This pleases Stipe. He\u2019s a supporter of the protest; in fact he\u2019s just released his first solo single, Your Capricious Soul, with a pay-as-much-as-you-like price tag, all monies going to Extinction Rebellion. \u201cI mean,\u201d he says, \u201cI came into London today, and I can\u2019t think of a better excuse to be late for a meeting than a bunch of people who are literally looking at the end of us \u2013 and we\u2019re taking a bunch of species with us if we go \u2013 and trying to do something about it \u2026 Oh! Have one of these!\u201d He digs into his bag and gives me his own specially designed XR sticker. We take the stairs to his suite \u2013 \u201cI asked for a small room,\u201d he says, laughing at himself, \u201cbut they insisted\u201d \u2013 where Stipe fiddles expertly with the coffee machine and shows me how he likes to slice a pear. \u201cYou cut it like this, and then you can stand the core up on a plate, like a column. Then you photograph it from all sides and animate the images, so it looks like the column is spinning,\u201d he says. Stipe, as you can tell, is not your usual pop star. In fact, he\u2019s not really a pop star at all these days, though he\u2019s working on solo material, occasionally produces other bands, such as Fischerspooner, and is still best known as the singer in REM. Now 59, slight and neat, he has the hard-to-pin-down feel of a much younger person. There\u2019s no weight about him, no sense of him becoming settled in his ways. Instead, he reminds me of a curious faun: skittery, friendly, interested but naturally shy. He\u2019s a talker, but he\u2019s not dominant; he doesn\u2019t swamp you with big ego charisma, though he\u2019s utterly charming. How astonishing that he became so famous, I think. You wouldn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d be able to bear it, despite his ease in a suite. Instead of a lead singer, Stipe has the air of an artist, regarding the world from unusual angles. And actually, since REM split, in 2011, Stipe has been just this, making installations and video work, sculpture and photography. He filmed his first artistic mentor, Jeremy Ayers, dancing for seven minutes, then set it to house music composed on a Moog. He makes books and experimental sculptures in his studio in New York, where he lives with his long-term partner, Thomas (pronounced Tohma) Dozol, who\u2019s also a photographer. In fact, in the years since REM, Stipe has been quite at ease with exploring his art, with not performing. \u201cIt feels like the real me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m working in all these different mediums and it makes sense.\u201d At one point he grew the most enormous wild man beard, though it\u2019s trimmed short today. He wears a green polo shirt, jeans, green socks and a beautiful large gold ring on his left hand. Stipe is in London as part of a short promotional tour, with a double set of duties. It\u2019s the 25th anniversary of REM\u2019s Monster, and there\u2019s a special box set coming out, so he\u2019s been chatting about that to journalists, alongside REM musicians Peter Buck and Mike Mills. Separately, he\u2019s also here to discuss his new book of photographs, the second in a series made in collaboration with other people. The first, Volume 1, came out last year: it featured just 35 photographs and was made with artist/curator Jonathan Berger. The second, Our Interference Times: A Visual Record, with writer Douglas Coupland, has just been published. And it\u2019s Interference Times that we\u2019re here to contemplate. We put the book on the table, open it at page one\u2026 \u201cA window,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cIn black and white. And kind of shitty, like a shitty cellphone picture. Every image after this is colour, like boom, here we are in real life. Or fantasy life. It\u2019s basically the mind of Michael.\u201d Our Interference Times is a far weightier tome than Volume 1, and has a different tone. Volume 1 played with ideas of celebrity, intimacy and family, showcasing snaps of a young River Phoenix in the back of a car, of Kurt Cobain\u2019s hands. There were also a couple of pictures, not taken by Stipe, but owned by him, of James Dean, of Marilyn Monroe as a baby, and an outrageous Esquire dinner party at the former New York nightclub Studio 54 featuring Andy Warhol and Donald Trump. I interviewed Stipe onstage at the ICA about Volume 1 last year: we noted that few of the portraits showed people looking straight at the camera. Stipe is too offbeat, too wary for that. The new book is less densely populated, though there are pictures of people, and those without humans show evidence of our interference with nature\u2019s design. Stipe talks about one, which seems to be there to deliberately annoy neat freaks. It\u2019s a picture of a manhole cover, a pavement and a fence. None of them fit together properly. It\u2019s maddening \u2026 though Stipe sees it differently. \u201cYou have these striations from a natural material, made into concrete,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have these stones laid out as a mosaic, a manhole cover. And then a tree that\u2019s been cut into slabs. It\u2019s man attempting to create order from chaos. A lot of the book is really about that old waltz between man and nature.\u201d Actually, there are a lot of regimented grids in the book, though these are often out of whack, or they\u2019re details of something that you can\u2019t quite work out, that you think is something different. On more than one occasion, you find yourself turning your head, wondering: What IS that?, until you see. Photographs are laid out to play off each other, with one almost chatting to its facing companion. For instance, here\u2019s a photograph of a naked, painted man\u2026 \u201cI painted him,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cI took the picture from on top of a ladder, he\u2019s lying on the studio floor. I turned it upside down, so he looks like Icarus falling from the sky.\u201d Opposite this floating, delicate figure is a shot of a heavy marble statue of Hermes fastening his sandal, which Stipe saw in Versailles. The contrast between the fluidity and solidity enhances both. Often what Stipe and Coupland, who are old friends, were interested in \u2013 especially Stipe \u2013 is the interaction between our old analogue lives and our new digital ones. There are many photographs of photographs: mobile-phone snaps of a computer screen displaying an older picture created with a film camera. Stipe is fascinated with how this doesn\u2019t really work, how the different media don\u2019t talk to each other very well, even though they\u2019re essentially doing the same thing. The pixels shudder, the focus is kaput. He\u2019s interested in how the past and future are overlapping, but ineptly, inelegantly. Does this mean that the past was better? After all, this is a book he\u2019s promoting, not a computer game, and one for which he spent a lot of time getting the details right. He wanted the images to bleed right out to the edges, he wanted the pages to only be numbered once in every five. When I mention that I love how the book smells (like old books), he\u2019s really chuffed: he was careful to choose a particular ink, with a particularly pleasing aroma. \u201cI like that the book is an artefact,\u201d he says. \u201cTen years ago, I did a whole series of pieces about books, because we all thought that books were going away and we\u2019d all be looking at everything backlit from now on. But we were wrong.\u201d One of the shots is of his lyrics to Hope, from Up, and Stipe mentions that the song is about a man trying to save his own life by turning to a seemingly ridiculous experimental medical procedure (injecting himself with alligator DNA). He connects it to this same analogue-meets-digital feeling. \u201cThis weird 30-year period that we\u2019re in,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, I think it\u2019s going to be 40 years \u2013 until the next shoe drops, when it\u2019s like: \u2018Holy fuck, where are we?\u2019 The next shoe dropping will be something mad like a world leader announcing: \u2018Yes, in fact we are living among aliens, or they are living among us. And we\u2019ve known it for 80 years and we didn\u2019t tell you because we thought it would freak you out.\u2019 Or, the next shoe dropping is another Fukushima, but on a grander scale. Or it\u2019s that medical research advances so quickly that suddenly there\u2019s a cure for everything, but you have to be a billionaire to be able to afford it.\u201d What he means, I think, is that the future is amazing and terrifying, and almost upon us: how are we dealing with it? How is it changing us? He wonders about social media. He used to post pictures on Instagram, and there was a time when he\u2019d put up selfies taken with famous people, but cut the other famous person out of frame, just leaving himself, grinning like a loon. \u201cYes, cutting Salman Rushdie\u2019s face in half, or Patti Smith, or Tilda Swinton or Sofia Coppola. With me laughing or smiling in that centre. I thought it was funny.\u201d He\u2019s stopped now, moved his Instagram to private, and has no Twitter presence at all. At one point last year, his website was just a series of mad moving images, though now it\u2019s promoting Your Capricious Soul. He\u2019s not frightened of the future; he\u2019s just interested. \u201cVisually, with digital technology we\u2019re actually coming closer to nature,\u201d he says, \u201cIf you look at anything natural under a microscope, it breaks down into fractals. And we are now looking at the world in fractals, through pixels, rather than a halftone, which is how we used to see images with print.\u201d Stipe has taken thousands of photographs in his time: about 37,000, he thinks, kept in \u201ca house\u201d and in storage facilities. He\u2019s a massive hoarder (when he puts on a jumper later, he mentions that it\u2019s one that he bought in the 1990s, and found the other day when going through a storage container), and he started photography young, taking a course when he was 13, then studying photography and painting at the University of Georgia before leaving to form REM.

Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked about its economic impact, Rudd said: \u201cOur government\u2019s own assessments are that it will hurt the economy, I think, by 4% to 6% a year.

He said Johnson \u201cmay well be in contempt of parliament or the courts\u201d for having sent an additional letter to the EU arguing against a Brexit extension. \u201cNot signing the [extension request] letter? He\u2019s behaving a bit like a spoiled brat,\u201d he said. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was optimistic that Johnson had enough support to get his deal passed. \u201cWe seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons. Why hasn\u2019t parliament pushed this through? That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do this week,\u201d he told the Marr show. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal. Why would we have a second referendum?\u201d Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, insisted the UK would be leaving on 31 October and an extension would not be necessary.",

      "body": "<p>In the second instalment of his <em>Book of Dust</em> trilogy, <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em>, Philip Pullman makes what appears to be a passing reference to Peter Frankopan\u2019s revisionist history of the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/06/silk-roads-peter-frankopan-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Silk Roads</em></a>. Our hero, Lyra Silvertongue, is now 20, a student at the Oxford of Pullman\u2019s parallel world. She is studying at St Sophia\u2019s, where, in an end-of-term tutorial, her supervisor tells her that, to gain more than a superficial grasp of Byzantine politics, she should \u201cmake sure to do some reading\u2026 Frankopan\u2019s good\u201d. So we know that, even if electricity hasn\u2019t yet reached Lyra\u2019s world, <em>The Silk Roads</em> has.</p> <p>A deeper reading of <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em> reveals a more profound relationship between the two books. Lyra\u2019s adventures take place in a world in which central Asia and the silk routes are once again at the heart of world affairs. A \u201crose panic\u201d has swept across the region, sparking a politico-economic crisis in Anatolia and Tajikistan. Fundamentalist \u201cmen from the mountains\u201d are invading the extensive and beautiful rose gardens, driving farmers from their homes and creating a wave of refugees flooding into Europe. The roses are apparently wanted by multinational pharmaceutical companies, but also by the Magisterium \u2013 the malevolent puritanical church.</p> <p>When Lyra first hears of the rose panic, it\u2019s from a friend in college whose father has been bankrupted by it. He has set off to Latakia in an attempt to recover his fortune. Place (and indeed character) names in Pullman are rarely without subtext, and Latakia is the modern Syrian name for the ancient trading port of Laodicea. The church of Laodicea is criticised by the author of the Book of Revelations for being \u201clukewarm\u201d in its faith and particularly for having business dealings with other religions. Similarly, when Lyra sets out on the quest that is the narrative engine of the book \u2013 to recover her daemon, Pan (a kind of familiar) \u2013 she heads first for Smyrna, then Seleukeia, then Aleppo, all key nodes on the silk routes, all places where once Christian and Muslim populations lived in tolerant and profitable cooperation, but that are now sites of tension or outright war (both in Lyra\u2019s world and in ours).</p> <p>The intersection of religion and economics is central to Frankopan\u2019s sweeping history and to Pullman\u2019s novel. It\u2019s telling that Lyra is studying economic history at university \u2013 her quest pits her against both hardline religion and the neoliberal corporate interests that have taken over her university and the rose industry.

      "bodyText": "In the second instalment of his Book of Dust trilogy, The Secret Commonwealth, Philip Pullman makes what appears to be a passing reference to Peter Frankopan\u2019s revisionist history of the world, The Silk Roads. Our hero, Lyra Silvertongue, is now 20, a student at the Oxford of Pullman\u2019s parallel world. She is studying at St Sophia\u2019s, where, in an end-of-term tutorial, her supervisor tells her that, to gain more than a superficial grasp of Byzantine politics, she should \u201cmake sure to do some reading\u2026 Frankopan\u2019s good\u201d. So we know that, even if electricity hasn\u2019t yet reached Lyra\u2019s world, The Silk Roads has. A deeper reading of The Secret Commonwealth reveals a more profound relationship between the two books. Lyra\u2019s adventures take place in a world in which central Asia and the silk routes are once again at the heart of world affairs. A \u201crose panic\u201d has swept across the region, sparking a politico-economic crisis in Anatolia and Tajikistan. Fundamentalist \u201cmen from the mountains\u201d are invading the extensive and beautiful rose gardens, driving farmers from their homes and creating a wave of refugees flooding into Europe. The roses are apparently wanted by multinational pharmaceutical companies, but also by the Magisterium \u2013 the malevolent puritanical church. When Lyra first hears of the rose panic, it\u2019s from a friend in college whose father has been bankrupted by it. He has set off to Latakia in an attempt to recover his fortune. Place (and indeed character) names in Pullman are rarely without subtext, and Latakia is the modern Syrian name for the ancient trading port of Laodicea. The church of Laodicea is criticised by the author of the Book of Revelations for being \u201clukewarm\u201d in its faith and particularly for having business dealings with other religions. Similarly, when Lyra sets out on the quest that is the narrative engine of the book \u2013 to recover her daemon, Pan (a kind of familiar) \u2013 she heads first for Smyrna, then Seleukeia, then Aleppo, all key nodes on the silk routes, all places where once Christian and Muslim populations lived in tolerant and profitable cooperation, but that are now sites of tension or outright war (both in Lyra\u2019s world and in ours). The intersection of religion and economics is central to Frankopan\u2019s sweeping history and to Pullman\u2019s novel. It\u2019s telling that Lyra is studying economic history at university \u2013 her quest pits her against both hardline religion and the neoliberal corporate interests that have taken over her university and the rose industry. Pullman\u2019s \u201cmen from the mountains\u201d are yet another trope we find in Frankopan: the threat of these barbarians is employed by the Magisterium as the Persian and Byzantine rulers used the Huns and the Mongols \u2013 to supress internal opposition and justify demagoguery. The Secret Commonwealth is a book whose political signification is much closer to the surface than in earlier work: both the refugee crisis and the current state of democracy are repeatedly referenced. There\u2019s something really interesting going on here: by interjecting familiar real-world concerns into a well-loved fiction universe, Pullman gives them added urgency, powerful resonance. A scene in which a ferry capsizes a boat of refugees is almost unreadably tragic; doubly so when we see it through the eyes of Lyra, with whom many of us have grown up. There\u2019s one final parallel between Pullman and Frankopan\u2019s books: The Silk Roads asked us to re-examine our perspectives on history. The Secret Commonwealth does the same with our conception of what a novel ostensibly for children can do. It\u2019s darker and more dangerous than much YA fiction, but there was nothing here that my 11-year-old couldn\u2019t handle \u2013 indeed he raced through it quicker than I did; loved it, if possible, even more.

Her response, in 1999\u2019s <em>The Book of Jewish Food</em>, was to declare that, \u201cbecause a culture is complex does not mean it does not exist\u201d. This phrase could sum up Roden\u2019s extraordinary life\u2019s work. For more than five decades she has devoted herself to the task of piecing together complex food cultures and proving that they not only exist, they must also be shared. It\u2019s largely thanks to her that ingredients such as tahini and couscous have become British staples. To appreciate how much we owe Claudia Roden, consider the fact that when she was writing her first masterpiece, <em>A Book of Middle Eastern Food</em>, in the 1960s, she was told by many British people that she would have nothing to write about because Middle Eastern food was all \u201csheep\u2019s eyes and testicles\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5e322b9e-73f2-4eb2-bde7-d6b6c3c3fe31\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5FIkoQ801Lc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We are all, to some degree, eating in Roden\u2019s world.

He\u2019d grown up eating his grandmother\u2019s garlic- and cumin-scented cuisine which she made for family and friends in her low-tech kitchen in Hampstead Garden Suburb. But now here were apparently familiar dishes presented as if they were haute cuisine, arranged on exquisite plates. Cesar saw echoes of his grandmother\u2019s aubergines with tahini, her fried cauliflower, her platters of bulgur wheat and stuffed vine leaves, her herb salads and her moist, flourless cakes. The deli turned out to be one of the first branches of Ottolenghi. When Roden met Yotam Ottolenghi for the first time, at a charity event, he confided that her books were his most cherished bedside reading. We now speak of the \u201cOttolenghi effect\u201d to describe the popularity in the UK and beyond of Middle Eastern ingredients such as pomegranate molasses and za\u2019atar. But, as Ottolenghi himself has always generously admitted, Roden\u2019s influence on his food is hard to miss. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/10/ofm-awards-index-2019-atom\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To return to her early books is to see that she was fiercely ahead of her time.

In the times of the pharaohs, tomb paintings suggest Egyptians were already eating molokhia soup, made from a glutinous green leaf, which is eaten in Egypt to this day.</p> \n<p>To Roden, this is more than an academic argument. When she started writing about the Middle East in the 60s, she was uncomfortably aware that many in the UK had \u201ca disgust for the people and for the culture\u201d. Sometimes people would mock Middle Eastern food to her face. Her beloved ful medames were \u201cfoul\u201d, apparently. In the Middle East, \u201cIf two people have eaten together,\u201d writes Roden, \u201cthey are compelled to treat each other well.\u201d Part of what she is doing with her work, I feel, is urging us to treat each other better.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/19/ofm-classic-cookbook-claudia-roden-book-of-middle-eastern-food\">OFM\u2019s classic cookbooks: Claudia Roden\u2019s Book of Middle Eastern Food</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I ask her which of her books she is most proud of. She says it\u2019s <em>A Book of Middle Eastern Food</em> and <em>The Book of Jewish Food</em>: \u201cI was the first and it mattered.\u201d Right from the beginning she felt a recipe was a way of recording authentic memories. This was why she went about the process in such a slow and laborious manner. All over the Mediterranean, she would arrive in a city and \u201caccost people\u201d, asking them for their favourite recipe. In London if she had done this, she says, people would have thought, \u201cThis lady is mad\u201d, but found in most other places people were only too eager to talk. She spoke to strangers on trains and interviewed the elderly in old people\u2019s homes. Each recipe she acquired felt like a \u201ctreasure\u201d because it belonged to a particular culture, often one which people had been wrenched away from. \u201cI had to tell these stories,\u201d she says. Stories such as the origins of the meat pies from Salonika in Greece described in <em>The Book of Jewish Food</em>. Salonika had one of the largest Sephardic Jewish communities in the Mediterranean, which was destroyed by the Nazis. Roden\u2019s recipe is a relic from a lost city. </p> \n<p>Few others have ever taken so seriously the idea of a recipe as heritage and her legacy extends far beyond the cookbook shelf. A couple of years ago, she was giving a talk at the Jewish Museum in New York and someone in the audience pointed out that if she were writing her Jewish book today, she could have spared herself the bother and found it all on the internet. The memory makes Roden smile wryly as she sips her prosecco. She does occasionally look things up online, she tells me: \u201cBut I have to say, a lot of the food on the internet is from my books.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/10/ofm-awards-label-2019-atom\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

In the Middle East, \u201cIf two people have eaten together,\u201d writes Roden, \u201cthey are compelled to treat each other well.\u201d Part of what she is doing with her work, I feel, is urging us to treat each other better. I ask her which of her books she is most proud of. She says it\u2019s A Book of Middle Eastern Food and The Book of Jewish Food: \u201cI was the first and it mattered.\u201d Right from the beginning she felt a recipe was a way of recording authentic memories. This was why she went about the process in such a slow and laborious manner. All over the Mediterranean, she would arrive in a city and \u201caccost people\u201d, asking them for their favourite recipe. In London if she had done this, she says, people would have thought, \u201cThis lady is mad\u201d, but found in most other places people were only too eager to talk. She spoke to strangers on trains and interviewed the elderly in old people\u2019s homes. Each recipe she acquired felt like a \u201ctreasure\u201d because it belonged to a particular culture, often one which people had been wrenched away from. \u201cI had to tell these stories,\u201d she says. Stories such as the origins of the meat pies from Salonika in Greece described in The Book of Jewish Food. Salonika had one of the largest Sephardic Jewish communities in the Mediterranean, which was destroyed by the Nazis. Roden\u2019s recipe is a relic from a lost city. Few others have ever taken so seriously the idea of a recipe as heritage and her legacy extends far beyond the cookbook shelf. A couple of years ago, she was giving a talk at the Jewish Museum in New York and someone in the audience pointed out that if she were writing her Jewish book today, she could have spared herself the bother and found it all on the internet. The memory makes Roden smile wryly as she sips her prosecco. She does occasionally look things up online, she tells me: \u201cBut I have to say, a lot of the food on the internet is from my books.\u201d",

It\u2019s 20 years since the first episode of <em>The Naked Chef</em>, the show that made a cheeky Essex lad famous for poking anchovies into a leg of lamb, and thus made cooking accessible to people who\u2019d never opened an oven in their life. Thirty-six TV series and one-off programmes followed, and 33 books, the success of which made him the UK\u2019s second-biggest selling author of all time, and more than a chef \u2013 he became a walking kitemark, denoting simplicity and health. But there were failures too, the most public being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/21/jamie-oliver-jobs-administrators-restaurants-jamies-italian\" title=\"\">closure of 22 restaurants</a> in the Jamie\u2019s Italian group in May. Which illuminated something \u2013 the gap between Food Jamie, national treasure, beloved for his simple recipes, his \u201cchop and chat\u201d and his campaigning work on child obesity, and Business Jamie, a man of dense spreadsheets, personal losses of millions of pounds, and more than 1,000 redundancies this summer. </p> \n<p>Oliver talks hungrily, speeding through complicated ideas before abruptly changing direction again and dropping you off somewhere in postwar Britain with a lengthy aside on rationing. To interview him requires a sharp pencil. But he pauses now, and considers the gap. How will Business Jamie\u2019s failures affect his standing as national treasure? And how will he navigate the tension between these two public faces? \u201cWell, it\u2019s really hard. But healthy, if your heart\u2019s in the right place.\u201d He smiles, remembering. \u201cThere was a moment, back when the business started to get massive, and I knew I could change direction, or pull out altogether. It was a conversation that me and my missus had: I either just sort of disappear, you know, or we have a go at making it mean something a bit \u2026 extra.\u201d They decided to have a go.</p> \n<p>And quickly, the \u201cextras\u201d \u2013 his plans to save the world \u2013 became the focus. \u201cSo whether that\u2019s Fifteen,\u201d the restaurant he set up in 2002 to train disengaged young people for a job in the food industry, \u201cor school dinners,\u201d his 2005 campaign that pressured the government to commit new funds to improve school food, \u201cthat\u2019s the real stuff. That\u2019s what we do.\u201d More recently, in 2015, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/22/jamie-oliver-expects-kicking-sugar-tax-sweetened-drinks\" title=\"\">petitioned for a sugary drinks tax</a>; the government introduced the soft drinks industry levy a year later. In 2018 he persuaded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/23/junk-food-ad-ban-on-london-transport-to-take-effect-in-february\" title=\"\">Transport for London to ban</a> the marketing of food that\u2019s high in fat, salt and sugar to children, and campaigned to restrict the sale of energy drinks \u2013 supermarkets agreed to stop selling them to under-16s within 12 months. \u201cI find the idea that food is everything quite beautiful. But on the other hand, we\u2019ve never had more food banks in the UK, never spent less proportionally to our wages on food than now. We live in brilliant but peculiar times.\u201d</p> \n<p>One result of Oliver and Jools (his wife of 19 years) deciding to \u201chave a go\u201d has been five children, the second youngest of whom, nine-year-old Buddy, came to work with Oliver this morning, rising at 4.30am to make scrambled eggs on Facebook Live. It\u2019s what Oliver did, sort of \u2013 he was paid to work in his family\u2019s pub when he was the same age, and now it\u2019s Buddy\u2019s source of pocket money. He slides onto his dad\u2019s lap, and Oliver softens and slows. \u201cBuddy is thus far my big hope.\u201d To take over Oliver\u2019s empire? \u201cWell, I\u2019m not putting too much pressure on him. Although just before you got here, I got the campaigns team to tell him what they do. These are the guys collaborating with NGOs about child health. But I was like,\u201d he points to the large table beside us where a group of studious people tap quickly on laptops, \u201cthis dude\u2019s like 007 \u2013 he has to go into government, listen to a lot of lies and work out what the truth is. And then, you know <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels</em>, right? So these three go to data and science reports and \u2026 I think he got it? But then he said he wanted to go and play on the Space Invaders, so \u2026\u201d Aside: there is an office Space Invaders machine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb143765246d6b4af551bd6673bb9e5d69fd2829\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb143765246d6b4af551bd6673bb9e5d69fd2829/0_54_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Oliver in 2002 at the launch of Fifteen in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Oliver in 2002 at the launch of Fifteen in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Myung Jung Kim/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The team keep typing. The following week they will publish a report detailing how the company is to become a \u201csocial impact business\u201d focused on the 2030 Project, aiming to halve childhood obesity by the end of the next decade. It announced its intention to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/23/jamie-oliver-to-create-ethical-b-corp-from-remnants-of-his-empire\" title=\"\">certified as a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/23/jamie-oliver-to-create-ethical-b-corp-from-remnants-of-his-empire\" title=\"\">\u201cB corp</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/23/jamie-oliver-to-create-ethical-b-corp-from-remnants-of-his-empire\" title=\"\">\u201d</a>, a status given to businesses assessed on their \u201csocial and environmental performance\u201d \u2013 other such food companies include smoothie brand Innocent and Divine Chocolate. Is this his way of reconciling the two sides of his public image? Perhaps \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult to unpick, because he is so consumed with the \u201cgood work\u201d that it\u2019s difficult to draw him on \u2026 the work. His meandering mind and pace of thought have obviously contributed to his success \u2013 few people could plough such a clear path from pasta bakes to tackling the obesity crisis. And his passion for change is clear and exciting \u2013 \u201cI believe the 2030 Project will be my legacy,\u201d he writes. But to talk to him about anything else can be frustrating \u2013 which means there are a number of times where I find myself raising my palm flatly, and saying, \u201cWait.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019ve got a really amazing job, in that I live on your shelf in your kitchen</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Because there are some questions I want to ask him, and some are related to his campaigning, yes, but some are not \u2013 some are about his politics, and his family, and his failures. How did he feel, for example, about Boris Johnson dismissing what he called \u201csin taxes\u201d on sugary drinks? \u201cWhen you start to understand the code, the rhetoric, as you become battle hardened, you realise that was just a message to his own people.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a messy business, politics.\u201d Now he understands the code, is there anything he wishes he\u2019d done differently? He huffs a little \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like the concept of \u201cregret\u201d. But, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d do Fifteen today. Because I would be thinking about it wrong. Fifteen was about being the right age at the right time.\u201d He\u2019s 44 now. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to work with as many young people as possible, because they\u2019re not corrupted. It\u2019s still one of my most proud moments, but it happened because I was green and just romantic enough, and just stupid enough. And honestly, when you get older, when you get methodical, you quickly get boring. And when you get boring, who gives a shit?\u201d</p> \n<p>He is working hard to stay interesting, which means \u2013 and he grabs Buddy again as he talks \u2013 listening to people who are still naive, still romantic. \u201cWe need some magic, and I think magic comes from kids. The kids who are talking about the environment and climate change, well, there\u2019s no gap between that and the food system. My dream is to make a <em>Blue Planet</em>, David Attenborough-style epic explaining all this. Can you imagine? Yeah, big, bold, fantastical clarity \u2013 complicated stories in really simple ways.\u201d Does he see himself as a David Attenborough figure? He laughs, almost embarrassed but not quite. Is it important to him to be liked? \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to be liked. It\u2019s lovely. But if you\u2019ve got an opinion in this country, you divide people. I\u2019ve got a really amazing job, in that I live on your shelf in your kitchen. It\u2019s not bad.\u201d He is reminding himself. He leans into his son and inhales his hair.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b3576f3b2c76fcb54acfb95ba1185ca1f3900da\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b3576f3b2c76fcb54acfb95ba1185ca1f3900da/0_59_2738_1643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie and Jools Oliver and family in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie and Jools Oliver and family in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian G. Lawrence/GC Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His family life is so traditional it occasionally appears to have been fed through an Instagram filter. The seven of them live between two mansions in London and Essex, in listed homes with Agas. His eldest children watched his youngest son\u2019s birth. His teenage daughter will be the first Oliver to go to college. The <em>New York Times</em> reports Jools is angling for a sixth child. Is his family life as perfect as her social media suggests? \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve really learned about being a parent is you can\u2019t always have what you want. In the nicest possible way, it\u2019s carnage. Parents don\u2019t talk enough. If you do, you quickly realise that the nutty psycho you think you\u2019ve raised is actually quite normal. Which doesn\u2019t make it any easier, but does mean that maybe it\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201d</p> \n<p>Which brings us suddenly back to things that <em>are</em> as bad as you think \u2013 his recent, very public, very noisy failures. When the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group went into administration this spring it <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jamie-oliver-creditors-face-83m-hit-j2nmjcwv6\" title=\"\">owed creditors nearly \u00a383m</a>. Oliver injected \u00a326m into the company but finally had to close 22 restaurants. As the company burned around him he batted away criticism, both on the controversy of his lucrative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/jamie-oliver-is-burnishing-shells-reputation-and-tarnishing-his-own\" title=\"\">deal with Shell</a> petrol stations and gloating stories about his fall from grace. (After we meet he makes the headlines again for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/30/jamie-oliver-restaurant-closures\" title=\"\">paying himself \u00a35.2m</a> last year, down from \u00a38.6m the year before.) Returning with a camera crew to Fifteen after its closure, he wept. Today he talks about the press reaction with an ancient weariness. He wasn\u2019t surprised at the glee. \u201cI\u2019m just like a character in a movie, you know. When you work in the public eye you\u2019re fodder. But I\u2019m still human and actually unbelievably sensitive and quite shy, weirdly. But \u2026 tough shit. We just have to crack on and make the best of it. And I think we do.\u201d How is he feeling now? \u201cI\u2019m a bit battered and bruised. But I\u2019m being optimistic.\u201d Buddy is almost asleep in his arms now, white-blond and puppyish. Oliver kisses his head, and repeats a sort of mantra: \u201cThe only thing that really matters is this.\u201d Another rare pause.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b5c0e9594411a6db83284b0d8290f7dcc8c236e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b5c0e9594411a6db83284b0d8290f7dcc8c236e/302_1310_5172_5172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Jamie Oliver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhen things get bumpy it can\u2019t be in vain, you know? You\u2019ve got to learn something, you\u2019ve got to use it.\u201d He already seems to be making a mental list. He\u2019s learned, for instance, that if your business model isn\u2019t \u201cbendy enough to take stormy times\u201d, you fail. \u201cBut you dust yourself down, and you evolve. I would be upset if I couldn\u2019t sit next to you in 20 years and show you how the story\u2019s continued, right?\u201d I wonder if it\u2019s brought the two Jamies together. I wonder if it\u2019s helped define him. He chews his lip thoughtfully, as a dark realisation dawns. \u201cYou know what, I was never really a businessman before. But the irony is, I am now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/10/ofm-awards-label-2019-atom\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

We are sitting in the grand warehouse of the Jamie Oliver offices in north London, where today\u2019s staff lunch is pappardelle with dried porcini and thyme in a mascarpone and tomato sauce. Their in-house barista is employed through a social enterprise staffed by the homeless, and a huge sign by the door reads \u201cBRAVE\u201d. The atmosphere is more that of a bohemian family home than the headquarters of a multi-million-pound food empire \u2013 Oliver has no office, instead he takes meetings here, on the sofa, casual as pizza, a jaunty little scarf around his neck, a tired flicker in his eye.

The following week they will publish a report detailing how the company is to become a \u201csocial impact business\u201d focused on the 2030 Project, aiming to halve childhood obesity by the end of the next decade. It announced its intention to be certified as a \u201cB corp\u201d, a status given to businesses assessed on their \u201csocial and environmental performance\u201d \u2013 other such food companies include smoothie brand Innocent and Divine Chocolate. Is this his way of reconciling the two sides of his public image? Perhaps \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult to unpick, because he is so consumed with the \u201cgood work\u201d that it\u2019s difficult to draw him on \u2026 the work. His meandering mind and pace of thought have obviously contributed to his success \u2013 few people could plough such a clear path from pasta bakes to tackling the obesity crisis. And his passion for change is clear and exciting \u2013 \u201cI believe the 2030 Project will be my legacy,\u201d he writes. But to talk to him about anything else can be frustrating \u2013 which means there are a number of times where I find myself raising my palm flatly, and saying, \u201cWait.\u201d Because there are some questions I want to ask him, and some are related to his campaigning, yes, but some are not \u2013 some are about his politics, and his family, and his failures. How did he feel, for example, about Boris Johnson dismissing what he called \u201csin taxes\u201d on sugary drinks? \u201cWhen you start to understand the code, the rhetoric, as you become battle hardened, you realise that was just a message to his own people.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a messy business, politics.\u201d Now he understands the code, is there anything he wishes he\u2019d done differently? He huffs a little \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like the concept of \u201cregret\u201d. But, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d do Fifteen today. Because I would be thinking about it wrong. Fifteen was about being the right age at the right time.\u201d He\u2019s 44 now. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to work with as many young people as possible, because they\u2019re not corrupted. It\u2019s still one of my most proud moments, but it happened because I was green and just romantic enough, and just stupid enough. And honestly, when you get older, when you get methodical, you quickly get boring. And when you get boring, who gives a shit?\u201d He is working hard to stay interesting, which means \u2013 and he grabs Buddy again as he talks \u2013 listening to people who are still naive, still romantic. \u201cWe need some magic, and I think magic comes from kids. The kids who are talking about the environment and climate change, well, there\u2019s no gap between that and the food system. My dream is to make a Blue Planet, David Attenborough-style epic explaining all this. Can you imagine? Yeah, big, bold, fantastical clarity \u2013 complicated stories in really simple ways.\u201d Does he see himself as a David Attenborough figure? He laughs, almost embarrassed but not quite. Is it important to him to be liked? \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to be liked. It\u2019s lovely. But if you\u2019ve got an opinion in this country, you divide people. I\u2019ve got a really amazing job, in that I live on your shelf in your kitchen. It\u2019s not bad.\u201d He is reminding himself. He leans into his son and inhales his hair. His family life is so traditional it occasionally appears to have been fed through an Instagram filter. The seven of them live between two mansions in London and Essex, in listed homes with Agas. His eldest children watched his youngest son\u2019s birth. His teenage daughter will be the first Oliver to go to college. The New York Times reports Jools is angling for a sixth child. Is his family life as perfect as her social media suggests? \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve really learned about being a parent is you can\u2019t always have what you want. In the nicest possible way, it\u2019s carnage. Parents don\u2019t talk enough. If you do, you quickly realise that the nutty psycho you think you\u2019ve raised is actually quite normal. Which doesn\u2019t make it any easier, but does mean that maybe it\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201d Which brings us suddenly back to things that are as bad as you think \u2013 his recent, very public, very noisy failures. When the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group went into administration this spring it owed creditors nearly \u00a383m. Oliver injected \u00a326m into the company but finally had to close 22 restaurants. As the company burned around him he batted away criticism, both on the controversy of his lucrative deal with Shell petrol stations and gloating stories about his fall from grace. (After we meet he makes the headlines again for paying himself \u00a35.2m last year, down from \u00a38.6m the year before.) Returning with a camera crew to Fifteen after its closure, he wept. Today he talks about the press reaction with an ancient weariness. He wasn\u2019t surprised at the glee. \u201cI\u2019m just like a character in a movie, you know. When you work in the public eye you\u2019re fodder. But I\u2019m still human and actually unbelievably sensitive and quite shy, weirdly. But \u2026 tough shit. We just have to crack on and make the best of it. And I think we do.\u201d How is he feeling now? \u201cI\u2019m a bit battered and bruised. But I\u2019m being optimistic.\u201d Buddy is almost asleep in his arms now, white-blond and puppyish. Oliver kisses his head, and repeats a sort of mantra: \u201cThe only thing that really matters is this.\u201d Another rare pause. \u201cWhen things get bumpy it can\u2019t be in vain, you know? You\u2019ve got to learn something, you\u2019ve got to use it.\u201d He already seems to be making a mental list. He\u2019s learned, for instance, that if your business model isn\u2019t \u201cbendy enough to take stormy times\u201d, you fail. \u201cBut you dust yourself down, and you evolve. I would be upset if I couldn\u2019t sit next to you in 20 years and show you how the story\u2019s continued, right?\u201d I wonder if it\u2019s brought the two Jamies together. I wonder if it\u2019s helped define him. He chews his lip thoughtfully, as a dark realisation dawns. \u201cYou know what, I was never really a businessman before. But the irony is, I am now.\u201d",

The meat, sourced from west country farms, is served in piles of rose-hued beef, melting pork shoulder or plump chicken legs.

      "bodyText": "It might be going a bit far to describe the Bank Tavern as Bristol\u2019s best kept secret. After all it\u2019s impossible to get a table for its Sunday roasts until next summer (checking for cancellations is your best bet). Then again this beguiling pub \u2013 tucked away on one of Bristol\u2019s few medieval lanes to escape the Luftwaffe and the attentions of postwar town planners \u2013 is not exactly easy to find. That, of course, is part of its appeal \u2013 along with the snug interior with space for only 40 or so lucky diners on seven tables. Yet the landlord, Sam Gregory, who lives above the pub with his Irish staffie, Charlie, is getting a little uncomfortable with all the accolades his kitchen team are winning: first it was best Sunday lunch in Bristol at the city\u2019s Good Food awards, now it\u2019s best in the country. \u201cIt is quite an emotive subject because \u2026 what is the best Sunday roast? We are very much a backstreet boozer but I guess that\u2019s part of our charm,\u201d he says, in a quiet moment before the pub opens for a new week. \u201cYou just don\u2019t expect to get the quality of food you do when you first come through the door.\u201d On Sundays the usual suspects are faultlessly cooked: crisp roast potatoes, puffed-up Yorkshires, earthy-sweet root veg, creamy leeks and tender shredded brassicas. The meat, sourced from west country farms, is served in piles of rose-hued beef, melting pork shoulder or plump chicken legs. All this for just \u00a310; excellent starters, such as salt pork fritters, and desserts nudge the bill for three courses up to \u00a314.95. Gregory \u2013 who took charge as a fresh-faced graduate in the midst of the credit crunch in 2008 \u2013 is determined to keep the menu affordable so it remains a genuine community pub. \u201cI don\u2019t want to profiteer. My parents struggled to take us all out but they felt it was important,\u201d he says. \u201cI never wanted price to be a barrier to good food.\u201d Sundays are the focal point for the pub, just as they were for Gregory\u2019s family. He has fond memories of large gatherings back home in Plymouth. \u201cMy mum would disappear with 20 B&amp;H and a box of Blue Nun and then suddenly all this food would come out. Gardeners\u2019 Question Time would be on the radio,\u201d he says, smiling at the homely image he has conjured up for people of a certain age. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 it\u2019s just nice.\u201d The menu is seasonal and often includes shellfish and game caught by Gregory in the countryside surrounding Bristol. Punters sometimes glimpse him hauling in deer carcasses or bags stuffed with pigeons, rabbits or crayfish. \u201cThey see me dragging all sorts in here. There\u2019s no back door,\u201d he says The regulars also chip in with surplus allotment produce, from damsons and gooseberries to butternut squash. \u201cIf we eat what\u2019s on our doorsteps, it\u2019s cheaper and tends to be better quality,\u201d he says. Above all, the Bank aims to provide some of life\u2019s simple pleasures. \u201cOnce people relax into their seats they start reminiscing and catching up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about getting families and friends together to eat and talk.\u201d John St, Bristol BS1 2HR; banktavern.com",

A couple of dozen men are waiting for them, but within a minute or two, many more emerge, like spirits, from the dense trees that surround the lake. Soon there are maybe 200. They are, I\u2019ll find out, mainly Kurds and remarkably, considering the journeys they have taken and their present accommodation, most are in buoyant mood and well turned out. Only when you look closer do you notice that a disproportionate number are limping and a couple are on crutches; injuries picked up as they attempted to escape this place and find a better life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/10/ofm-awards-index-2019-atom\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The vans belong to Refugee Community Kitchen, a charity started in December 2015 by four Londoners, and this year\u2019s winner of OFM\u2019s Outstanding Achievement Award. When I visited in early September, Refugee Community Kitchen was providing a free dinner every evening in Puythouck and also at another site in Dunkirk, a leisure centre that housed around 1,000 people, including many women and children and at least 130 unaccompanied minors. In four years, the charity has served nearly 2.3 million mainly plant-based meals in France and the UK, through the help of 20,000 volunteers. On the menu tonight is a coconut and chickpea dal with potatoes and a tomato, cucumber and lettuce salad.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s good, nutritious food. Part of the charity\u2019s ethos is that the people they serve should have agency over their meals, which should be \u201cculturally appropriate\u201d. To this end, a condiments table is a key part of their offering: there is hummus, made this afternoon, plus tubs of sumac, onions, za\u2019atar, pickles and salt with which people can garnish their food. A large urn dispenses \u201csweet, sticky\u201d tea.</p> \n<p>As the volunteers set up serving tables, many refugees are happy to share their stories (or talk about Brexit, the ever-present threat of eviction and Manchester United). One, in excellent English, tells me that he wants to join his wife and three children who live near Solihull. His youngest daughter is seven months old, and he has not seen her since the spring. \u201cToo long,\u201d he says with a sad shake of his head. The day before he\u2019d stowed away on a truck only to turn on his GPS and find it was heading deeper into the continent, not to the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it illegally,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I can\u2019t do it legally, that\u2019s what I have to do. I\u2019ll keep trying, trying, trying.\u201d</p> \n<p>It might surprise you to learn that the population of refugees and migrants in northern France is still so large. It still surprises the founders of Refugee Community Kitchen: Steve Stavrinides, 48; Paula Gallardo, 51; Sam Jones, 45; and Janie Macintyre, 56. Well, it does, and it doesn\u2019t. They began their work after seeing the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees\">drowned in the Mediterranean in September 2015</a>, and reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/01/french-police-step-up-calais-refugee-evictions\">newspaper reports of the Calais Jungle</a>, a camp made on polluted wasteland that was soon home to around 4,000 people, including large populations from Eritrea, Afghanistan and Syria.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c8e2fe-4f3d-4cc9-b842-a6e489102e4a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PluvliT93cY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jones recalls: \u201cWe were tapping into a collective consciousness that loads of people were tapping into: we\u2019re rich and we\u2019re privileged as a society and individuals, we can see suffering and we feel powerless and not represented by our governments. And actually it\u2019s close enough, we can do something.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no longer in a country I\u2019ve never been to,\u201d adds Stavrinides. \u201cIt\u2019s on my doorstep.\u201d</p> \n<p>None of them had much previous experience with charity work. They had met in the early 1990s on the free-party scene, running raves in the UK and Europe. But it occurred to them that they might have transferable skills: Stavrinides and Gallardo are both involved in organising music festivals (Stavrinides runs stages at Glastonbury and Boomtown); Jones is a chef; Macintyre works in education and has been an activist for many years.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d been working festivals, weddings and events, where I\u2019d be putting up infrastructure and bringing it down and putting it away,\u201d says Gallardo. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Can\u2019t we just take it to Calais? Put it up and leave it there.\u2019 Because I did just feed 500 or 1,000 at a wedding and it\u2019s easy.\u201d</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t that simple. The Calais camp grew and grew, until ultimately the French government cleared it, after multiple attempts, in October 2016. At this point, it wasn\u2019t obvious whether the Refugee Community Kitchen needed to exist any more, certainly not in northern France. The group decided to start outreaches in the UK to serve hot meals to the homeless. The first opened in Camden, north London in early 2017, and there are now four in London and one in Edinburgh. They also began to think about following the trail of refugees through Europe: two trucks were bought, one with catering facilities, and Stavrinides and Jones got their HGV licences.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were like, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve got to take this somewhere else haven\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d says Stavrinides. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to go on the road, go to Greece, because that\u2019s where the need is going to be.\u2019\u201d He goes quiet, then continues: \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t. Because the need didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is a topical concern for the Refugee Community Kitchen. The week after I visit \u2013 a night when they served more than 1,200 meals (and ran out of food) \u2013 the camp in the leisure centre in Dunkirk was cleared by French riot police, watched by officials from the Home Office. People were loaded onto buses, families were split up and they were dispersed across France.</p> \n<p>Similar evictions have happened before, and the founders of Refugee Community Kitchen have learned that they usually achieve very little. Within a few days, a trickle of people return, and before long hundreds and then thousands congregate once again in the area around Calais and Dunkirk. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for 20 years in this area,\u201d says Gallardo. \u201cIt does often feel like it\u2019s going to end, but we\u2019ve realised we are going to be here a long time. And we\u2019ve realised also that we are committed and quite good at it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d100be2f3c30ee76652c4469653751fd57f6a1fa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d100be2f3c30ee76652c4469653751fd57f6a1fa/0_617_8272_4965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left, founders Steve Stavrinides, Janie Macintyre, Paula Gallardo and Sam Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left, founders Steve Stavrinides, Janie Macintyre, Paula Gallardo and Sam Jones</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s clearly not easy: all the founders have other jobs and take turns to come to France.

The Calais camp grew and grew, until ultimately the French government cleared it, after multiple attempts, in October 2016. At this point, it wasn\u2019t obvious whether the Refugee Community Kitchen needed to exist any more, certainly not in northern France. The group decided to start outreaches in the UK to serve hot meals to the homeless. The first opened in Camden, north London in early 2017, and there are now four in London and one in Edinburgh. They also began to think about following the trail of refugees through Europe: two trucks were bought, one with catering facilities, and Stavrinides and Jones got their HGV licences. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve got to take this somewhere else haven\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d says Stavrinides. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to go on the road, go to Greece, because that\u2019s where the need is going to be.\u2019\u201d He goes quiet, then continues: \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t. Because the need didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d This is a topical concern for the Refugee Community Kitchen. The week after I visit \u2013 a night when they served more than 1,200 meals (and ran out of food) \u2013 the camp in the leisure centre in Dunkirk was cleared by French riot police, watched by officials from the Home Office. People were loaded onto buses, families were split up and they were dispersed across France. Similar evictions have happened before, and the founders of Refugee Community Kitchen have learned that they usually achieve very little. Within a few days, a trickle of people return, and before long hundreds and then thousands congregate once again in the area around Calais and Dunkirk. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for 20 years in this area,\u201d says Gallardo. \u201cIt does often feel like it\u2019s going to end, but we\u2019ve realised we are going to be here a long time. And we\u2019ve realised also that we are committed and quite good at it.\u201d It\u2019s clearly not easy: all the founders have other jobs and take turns to come to France. It is also a never-ending struggle to recruit volunteers and attract donations, especially when the migrant crisis slips off the news agenda. \u201cOne of the most simple things you can do is put a hot bowl of nourishing food in the hands of someone who\u2019s hungry,\u201d says Macintyre. \u201cTo see their faces as they taste something that maybe reminds them of home or their mum used to do, it\u2019s so rewarding just to know it has such an impact. \u201cThe act of getting 1,000 meals a day isn\u2019t that simple,\u201d she goes on, \u201cbut putting a meal in someone\u2019s hands is.\u201d refugeecommunitykitchen.com",

Senior EU officials said it had been clear during the discussions among the leaders at a summit on Thursday that they would grant an extension. \u201cEven [the French president Emmanuel] Macron in the room didn\u2019t suggest otherwise\u201d, a source said. A spokesman for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace had said on Saturday evening that any further delay \u201cwas not in anyone\u2019s interest\u201d and urged the Commons to vote on the revised deal. The chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, a senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, tweeted: \u201cJohnson sent the letter, asking EU leaders for another Brexit extension. The European council should now grant a final long one, giving the UK time to sort itself out &amp; to prepare for all possible resolutions including a second referendum. Meanwhile [the] EU could deal with other pressing issues.\u201d The European parliament, which is sitting in Strasbourg this week, will only ratify the deal after it has been approved by the Commons. MEPs will next sit on 14 November unless an extraordinary session is scheduled, making 30 November a potential new Brexit day should the Commons have approved by then.",

What I now know is that the rehousing process resulted in even greater segregation of the two communities and that this had longer-term ramifications for sectarianism and division, including the emergence of \u201cpeace lines\u201d along what are called \u201cinterface areas\u201d, where largely Catholic and Protestant working-class communities border one another. These walls remain a prominent feature of many Belfast communities today. My early years living on our council estate included watching as a massive brick \u201cpeace wall\u201d was constructed across one perimeter. It was a security decision. There were frequently pitched battles between people on both sides of the divide; sometimes they involved shooting. Over time, however, other walls went up. Parts of the estate \u2013 which had felt open and accessible when we first moved in \u2013 were cordoned off by a series of smaller walls that made it difficult to enter or exit certain areas. When I returned to visit family and friends on as a young adult, it was beginning to feel more like a containment area than a housing estate.

      "body": "<p>I am a therapist couch hopper (sorry to any of my cuckolded shrinks now reading this). I\u2019ve sampled mental health services like a toddler at a pick-n-mix stall, all in the hope of remedying the severe psychological issues that developed during my childhood.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a taster. I\u2019ve had cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to manage my once debilitating OCD, a condition that began when I was very young. In accordance with Islamic practice, I was taught to count my sins on my left shoulder (wanking over Leonardo DiCaprio in <em>Titanic</em> = infinity sin points), and to ensure they didn\u2019t exceed the good deeds I had to count on my right. And I became obsessed with counting.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been in psychodynamic psychotherapy to help overcome my pathological struggle to form intimate relationships, which have all been shadowed by my childhood fears that the very nature of who I am would lead to rejection (from Allah, my parents and society). I\u2019ve even attempted bioacoustic therapy, where sound frequencies are used to interfere with neural pathways conditioned by traumatic memories, in a bid to circumvent them and encourage positive thought-processes. And while each has had significant merits, none has been as therapeutic as the reparative art of drag. Of all things, the unadulterated joy of being a drag queen has healed me in ways I could have never envisioned.</p> <p>Drag fulfils many of the aims of CBT. The therapy involves weakening entrenched negative thought patterns and replacing them with more self-reparative ones. For instance, my compulsive behaviours germinate from a core belief that I am worthless. I carry this feeling everywhere I go. It generated when I was very young and petrified about the prospect of going to hell (not in a metaphorical sense \u2013 I believed quite literally that an eternity in blazing flames and torture awaited me in the afterlife). And being raised in a family where any kind of sexual or gender transgression was fiercely prohibited led to the unshakable belief that I was wrong inside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"20708811e315c8d48dc06fc21c24433212f7e202\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20708811e315c8d48dc06fc21c24433212f7e202/472_385_4076_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amrou Al-Kadhi in drag, with bright blue hair in plaits and tied up, on a pink/red background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Costumes and style were the unlikely route to embracing my heritage.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so I became a perfectionist, punishing myself whenever I failed to receive 100% in a school test, rereading a piece of homework 32 times before submitting it (I was once on the brink of suicide when I discovered a grammatical error on a piece of coursework I had submitted). These compulsions for perfection became the only tool for convincing myself I was worth something. CBT has certainly helped with the mechanics of managing these behaviours, in mapping the structure of the thoughts when they play out. But it is only the gift of drag that has been able to change the very nature of my core beliefs.</p> <p>In drag, you live out a fantasy that directly contradicts the reality of your core beliefs. I was 20 when I created my drag alter-ego Glamrou, and an undergraduate when my OCD was at its worst. I couldn\u2019t sleep without wedging open my laptop with a book that was pressing down on the letter Z of the keyboard. I re-lived every conversation I had straight after it was over, convinced I\u2019d offended the other person. Whenever a friend took more than five minutes to respond to a text, I interpreted it as a sure sign they were rejecting me. A simple walk down the street sparked paranoia that even the traffic cones were disapproving of me.</p> <p>And so, what a surprise it was to experience pure majesty when in drag and on stage for the first time. For all my life being effeminate had led to bullying, shame, embarrassment and even violence, but in drag my femininity became a weapon. Drag empties out any notion of a queer person as \u201cweak\u201d. In drag, you create the rules. Deeply held feelings that I was a sinner became silenced by the power of standing proudly under a spotlight, my sequin dress producing a heavenly aura. Instead of punishment, who I was elicited validation and support from the audience.</p> <p>Drag mirrors the key philosophy of CBT therapy here: the repeated act of manifesting positive beliefs starts to unshackle the negative ones that tied me down. A decade of performing to audiences in the guise of a Middle Eastern goddess has taken me from fears of burning to rejoicing in the knowledge that I\u2019m a girl on fire.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Drag was the glue that brought all the pieces of my identity together</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With psychodynamic therapy, the relationship you build with your psychotherapist is critical. It is used as a map with which to investigate how you relate to everyone else in your life. I saw my psychotherapist almost every week for four years, during which I learned just how much my fear of rejection was interrupting the way I related to others. As a child, I held the sincere belief that hiding who I was inside would be the only way in which to keep people around.</p> <p>My parents, in an attempt to police my queer identity, employed strategies such as throwing away any camp clothes I purchased, telling me that I \u201cwas the source of their life\u2019s unhappiness\u201d and, after asking my mother whether she\u2019d ever meet a hypothetical boyfriend, saying \u201cit would be unfair of me to inflict myself on anyone\u201d because I was \u201cimpossible to love\u201d.</p> <p>Every relationship since has thus felt like an exhausting juggling act in which I work ferociously to stop others learning the truth of who I am. Like the Wizard of Oz, I hid behind a curtain while projecting something entirely different to the outside world.</p> <p>While psychodynamic psychotherapy has helped me understand and move past these behaviours, drag has been like a revolt against them. For an art form so artificial, drag is one of the most honest of performance mediums. You have to mine your depths and expel your guts on stage. Unapologetically, you take up space and demand that the room takes in all of who you are, and bows down to your every stitch and sequin. You re-fashion your face, body and clothes to force the world to accept you in the way you want to be seen. You combat the room with your darkest experiences, which you sublimate into humour and power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4c36e1dda78cfeb30dbb3477e266f4cc7195583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4c36e1dda78cfeb30dbb3477e266f4cc7195583/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amrou Al-Kadhi being made up to begin the transformation into a Middle Eastern goddess.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Girl on fire\u2019: Amrou Al-Kadhi begins the transformation into a Middle Eastern goddess. Makeup by Dean Rudd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People responded to my drag the more honest I became on stage; the act of expunging my transgressive thoughts and experiences in front of an audience led to more acceptance than I could have anticipated. Drag is like being out of the closet for a living \u2013 and when an audience celebrates you for this, it teaches you that you are worthy of love because of who you are, not in spite of it. It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that my most special relationships are with other drag performers, who have offered me the kind of family I yearned for growing up.</p> <p>Bioacoustic therapy has certainly calmed my badly wired neurological pathways. For most of my life, my fight or flight response was initiated every 10 minutes, with every instance of possible rejection or failure, including traffic lights going red, acting as a trigger for my anxiety.</p> <p>Early in my 20s, anything to do with the Middle East catalysed these defence mechanisms. The parental response to my sexual and gender identity, as well as my childhood fear of Allah\u2019s fiery wrath, meant that it was hard for me to be around Arabic speakers, or to engage with my cultural heritage. A few lines in Arabic could leave me sweating and unnerved.</p> <p>Drag was the unlikely route to me embracing my heritage. Five years ago I met an extraordinary Arab woman and fashion stylist who, as well as becoming a dear friend, also styled me for my drag troupe\u2019s first music video. She encouraged me to look back to the costumes and styles of Middle Eastern female pop stars, and I\u2019ve since learned to weave together my queer gender expression with the fabrics, textures and colours from my past.</p> <p>And in a weird twist of fate, drag has returned me to the person I thought it was helping me run away from \u2013 my beautiful Iraqi-Egyptian mother. I now regularly paint pictures of her on to my face \u2013 and instead of clamming up with dread at the sound of Arabic, I feel a sense of hope, and a strange wonder that drag has been the glue to tie all the fractured pieces of my identity together.</p> <p>Queer people from conservative backgrounds are working harder than you know to stay afloat every day. We\u2019re trying to convince both ourselves and everybody else that we\u2019re worth something, while constantly being told that we\u2019re not.

      "bodyText": "I am a therapist couch hopper (sorry to any of my cuckolded shrinks now reading this). I\u2019ve sampled mental health services like a toddler at a pick-n-mix stall, all in the hope of remedying the severe psychological issues that developed during my childhood. Here\u2019s a taster. I\u2019ve had cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to manage my once debilitating OCD, a condition that began when I was very young. In accordance with Islamic practice, I was taught to count my sins on my left shoulder (wanking over Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic = infinity sin points), and to ensure they didn\u2019t exceed the good deeds I had to count on my right. And I became obsessed with counting. I\u2019ve been in psychodynamic psychotherapy to help overcome my pathological struggle to form intimate relationships, which have all been shadowed by my childhood fears that the very nature of who I am would lead to rejection (from Allah, my parents and society). I\u2019ve even attempted bioacoustic therapy, where sound frequencies are used to interfere with neural pathways conditioned by traumatic memories, in a bid to circumvent them and encourage positive thought-processes. And while each has had significant merits, none has been as therapeutic as the reparative art of drag. Of all things, the unadulterated joy of being a drag queen has healed me in ways I could have never envisioned. Drag fulfils many of the aims of CBT. The therapy involves weakening entrenched negative thought patterns and replacing them with more self-reparative ones. For instance, my compulsive behaviours germinate from a core belief that I am worthless. I carry this feeling everywhere I go. It generated when I was very young and petrified about the prospect of going to hell (not in a metaphorical sense \u2013 I believed quite literally that an eternity in blazing flames and torture awaited me in the afterlife). And being raised in a family where any kind of sexual or gender transgression was fiercely prohibited led to the unshakable belief that I was wrong inside. And so I became a perfectionist, punishing myself whenever I failed to receive 100% in a school test, rereading a piece of homework 32 times before submitting it (I was once on the brink of suicide when I discovered a grammatical error on a piece of coursework I had submitted). These compulsions for perfection became the only tool for convincing myself I was worth something. CBT has certainly helped with the mechanics of managing these behaviours, in mapping the structure of the thoughts when they play out. But it is only the gift of drag that has been able to change the very nature of my core beliefs. In drag, you live out a fantasy that directly contradicts the reality of your core beliefs. I was 20 when I created my drag alter-ego Glamrou, and an undergraduate when my OCD was at its worst. I couldn\u2019t sleep without wedging open my laptop with a book that was pressing down on the letter Z of the keyboard. I re-lived every conversation I had straight after it was over, convinced I\u2019d offended the other person. Whenever a friend took more than five minutes to respond to a text, I interpreted it as a sure sign they were rejecting me. A simple walk down the street sparked paranoia that even the traffic cones were disapproving of me. And so, what a surprise it was to experience pure majesty when in drag and on stage for the first time. For all my life being effeminate had led to bullying, shame, embarrassment and even violence, but in drag my femininity became a weapon. Drag empties out any notion of a queer person as \u201cweak\u201d. In drag, you create the rules. Deeply held feelings that I was a sinner became silenced by the power of standing proudly under a spotlight, my sequin dress producing a heavenly aura. Instead of punishment, who I was elicited validation and support from the audience. Drag mirrors the key philosophy of CBT therapy here: the repeated act of manifesting positive beliefs starts to unshackle the negative ones that tied me down. A decade of performing to audiences in the guise of a Middle Eastern goddess has taken me from fears of burning to rejoicing in the knowledge that I\u2019m a girl on fire. With psychodynamic therapy, the relationship you build with your psychotherapist is critical. It is used as a map with which to investigate how you relate to everyone else in your life. I saw my psychotherapist almost every week for four years, during which I learned just how much my fear of rejection was interrupting the way I related to others. As a child, I held the sincere belief that hiding who I was inside would be the only way in which to keep people around. My parents, in an attempt to police my queer identity, employed strategies such as throwing away any camp clothes I purchased, telling me that I \u201cwas the source of their life\u2019s unhappiness\u201d and, after asking my mother whether she\u2019d ever meet a hypothetical boyfriend, saying \u201cit would be unfair of me to inflict myself on anyone\u201d because I was \u201cimpossible to love\u201d. Every relationship since has thus felt like an exhausting juggling act in which I work ferociously to stop others learning the truth of who I am. Like the Wizard of Oz, I hid behind a curtain while projecting something entirely different to the outside world. While psychodynamic psychotherapy has helped me understand and move past these behaviours, drag has been like a revolt against them. For an art form so artificial, drag is one of the most honest of performance mediums. You have to mine your depths and expel your guts on stage. Unapologetically, you take up space and demand that the room takes in all of who you are, and bows down to your every stitch and sequin. You re-fashion your face, body and clothes to force the world to accept you in the way you want to be seen. You combat the room with your darkest experiences, which you sublimate into humour and power. People responded to my drag the more honest I became on stage; the act of expunging my transgressive thoughts and experiences in front of an audience led to more acceptance than I could have anticipated. Drag is like being out of the closet for a living \u2013 and when an audience celebrates you for this, it teaches you that you are worthy of love because of who you are, not in spite of it. It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that my most special relationships are with other drag performers, who have offered me the kind of family I yearned for growing up. Bioacoustic therapy has certainly calmed my badly wired neurological pathways. For most of my life, my fight or flight response was initiated every 10 minutes, with every instance of possible rejection or failure, including traffic lights going red, acting as a trigger for my anxiety. Early in my 20s, anything to do with the Middle East catalysed these defence mechanisms. The parental response to my sexual and gender identity, as well as my childhood fear of Allah\u2019s fiery wrath, meant that it was hard for me to be around Arabic speakers, or to engage with my cultural heritage. A few lines in Arabic could leave me sweating and unnerved. Drag was the unlikely route to me embracing my heritage. Five years ago I met an extraordinary Arab woman and fashion stylist who, as well as becoming a dear friend, also styled me for my drag troupe\u2019s first music video. She encouraged me to look back to the costumes and styles of Middle Eastern female pop stars, and I\u2019ve since learned to weave together my queer gender expression with the fabrics, textures and colours from my past. And in a weird twist of fate, drag has returned me to the person I thought it was helping me run away from \u2013 my beautiful Iraqi-Egyptian mother. I now regularly paint pictures of her on to my face \u2013 and instead of clamming up with dread at the sound of Arabic, I feel a sense of hope, and a strange wonder that drag has been the glue to tie all the fractured pieces of my identity together. Queer people from conservative backgrounds are working harder than you know to stay afloat every day. We\u2019re trying to convince both ourselves and everybody else that we\u2019re worth something, while constantly being told that we\u2019re not. We try to stay positive and hopeful while facing perpetual violence. And we try to find acceptance and love when our experience has taught us only rejection. So it\u2019s no wonder that many of us suffer a plethora of mental health issues. I\u2019m grateful to all the therapists who have helped me work through mine; and to drag, for teaching me something I should have learned a long time ago: there\u2019s nothing wrong with me.

Its provisions now require Her Majesty\u2019s government to seek an extension of the period provided under article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union, including as applied by article 106a of the Euratom treaty, currently due to expire at 11pm GMT on 31 October 2019, until 11pm GMT on 31 January 2020.</p> <p>I am writing therefore to inform the European council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union, including as applied by article 106a of the Euratom treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11pm GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the government proposes that the period should be terminated early.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</p> <h2>Covering letter from Tim Barrow, Britain\u2019s ambassador to EU</h2> <p>Dear Secretary General,</p> <p>As the United Kingdom permanent representative to the European Union, I invite your attention to the following matter.</p> <p>Attached is a letter sent as required by the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019.</p> <p>In terms of the next steps for parliamentary process, Her Majesty\u2019s government will introduce the necessary legislation next week in order to proceed with ratification of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>I would be grateful for your acknowledgement of receipt of this letter.</p> <p>Sir Tim Barrow</p> <h2>Johnson\u2019s personal <strong>letter</strong> to Tusk</h2> <p>Dear Donald</p> <p>It was good to see you again at the European council this week where we agreed the historic new deal to permit the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 October.</p> <p>I am deeply grateful to you, President Juncker and to all my fellow European leaders for the statesmanship and statecraft which enabled us to achieve this historic milestone. I should also register my appreciation for Michel Barnier and his team for their imagination and diplomacy as we concluded the negotiations.</p> <p>When I spoke in parliament this morning, I noted the corrosive impact of the long delay in delivering the mandate of the British people from the 2016 referendum. I made clear that, while I believe passionately that both the UK and the EU will benefit from our decision to withdraw and develop a new relationship, that relationship will be founded on our deep respect and affection for our shared culture, civilisation, values and interests.</p> <p>We will remain the EU\u2019s closest partner and friend. The deal we approved at last week\u2019s European council is a good deal for the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU.</p> <p>Regrettably, parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new withdrawal agreement. The UK parliament representative will therefore submit the request mandated by the EU (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 later today.</p> <p>It is, of course, for the European council to decide when to consider the request and whether to grant it. In view of the unique circumstances, while I regret causing my fellow leaders to devote more of their time and energy to a question I had hoped we had resolved last week, I recognise that you may need to convene a European council.</p> <p>If it would be helpful to you, I would of course be happy to attend the start of any A50 council so that I could answer properly any question on the position of HM government and progress in the ratification process at that time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, although I would have preferred a different result today, the government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October.</p> <p>Indeed, many of those who voted against the government today have indicated their support for the new deal and for ratifying it without delay. I know that I can count on your support and that of our fellow leaders to move the deal forward, and I very much hope therefore that on the EU side also, the process can be completed to allow the agreement to enter into force, as the European council conclusions mandated.</p> <p>While it is open to the European council to accede to the request mandated by parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming prime minister, and made clear to parliament again today, my view, and the government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.</p> <p>We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent our peoples share. I am passionately committed to that endeavour.</p> <p>I am copying this letter to Presidents Juncker and Sassoli, and to members of the European council.</p> <p>Yours sincerely</p> <p>Boris Johnson</p> <h2>Johnson\u2019s letter to MPs and peers </h2> <p>Dear Colleague</p> <p>I wrote to you on Friday to outline why our new deal allows this country to take back control, get Brexit done and let the country move on.</p> <p>I have made clear that I do not want more delay. European leaders have made clear they do not want more delay. It is to my great regret that today the House has voted for more delay.</p> <p>The public want us to get Brexit done so the country can move on. The best thing for the United Kingdom and the European Union is for us to leave with this new deal on 31 October.</p> <p>I will not negotiate a delay with the European Union. I will tell the EU what I have told the British public for my 88 days as prime minister: further delay is not a solution.</p> <p>That is why next week this government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the European Union with our great new deal on 31 October.</p> <p>It is quite possible that our friends in the European Union will reject parliament\u2019s request for further delay (or not take a decision quickly). In these circumstances, I hope colleagues on all sides of the House will \u2013 faced with a choice of our new deal or no deal \u2013 support this new deal.</p> <p>Colleagues, more than three years after the British people voted to leave the European Union, they expect us to finally deliver on our promises. They expect us to get Brexit done, so we can all move on and focus on the people\u2019s priorities.</p> <p>I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on 31 October so the country can move on \u2013 and I hope I can count on your support in doing so.</p> <p>Yours sincerely</p> <p>Boris Johnson</p>",

I am writing therefore to inform the European council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union, including as applied by article 106a of the Euratom treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11pm GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the government proposes that the period should be terminated early. Yours sincerely, Prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Covering letter from Tim Barrow, Britain\u2019s ambassador to EU Dear Secretary General, As the United Kingdom permanent representative to the European Union, I invite your attention to the following matter. Attached is a letter sent as required by the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019. In terms of the next steps for parliamentary process, Her Majesty\u2019s government will introduce the necessary legislation next week in order to proceed with ratification of the withdrawal agreement. I would be grateful for your acknowledgement of receipt of this letter. Sir Tim Barrow Johnson\u2019s personal letter to Tusk Dear Donald It was good to see you again at the European council this week where we agreed the historic new deal to permit the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 October. I am deeply grateful to you, President Juncker and to all my fellow European leaders for the statesmanship and statecraft which enabled us to achieve this historic milestone. I should also register my appreciation for Michel Barnier and his team for their imagination and diplomacy as we concluded the negotiations. When I spoke in parliament this morning, I noted the corrosive impact of the long delay in delivering the mandate of the British people from the 2016 referendum. I made clear that, while I believe passionately that both the UK and the EU will benefit from our decision to withdraw and develop a new relationship, that relationship will be founded on our deep respect and affection for our shared culture, civilisation, values and interests. We will remain the EU\u2019s closest partner and friend. The deal we approved at last week\u2019s European council is a good deal for the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU. Regrettably, parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new withdrawal agreement. The UK parliament representative will therefore submit the request mandated by the EU (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 later today. It is, of course, for the European council to decide when to consider the request and whether to grant it. In view of the unique circumstances, while I regret causing my fellow leaders to devote more of their time and energy to a question I had hoped we had resolved last week, I recognise that you may need to convene a European council. If it would be helpful to you, I would of course be happy to attend the start of any A50 council so that I could answer properly any question on the position of HM government and progress in the ratification process at that time. Meanwhile, although I would have preferred a different result today, the government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October. Indeed, many of those who voted against the government today have indicated their support for the new deal and for ratifying it without delay. I know that I can count on your support and that of our fellow leaders to move the deal forward, and I very much hope therefore that on the EU side also, the process can be completed to allow the agreement to enter into force, as the European council conclusions mandated. While it is open to the European council to accede to the request mandated by parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming prime minister, and made clear to parliament again today, my view, and the government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us. We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent our peoples share. I am passionately committed to that endeavour. I am copying this letter to Presidents Juncker and Sassoli, and to members of the European council. Yours sincerely Boris Johnson Johnson\u2019s letter to MPs and peers Dear Colleague I wrote to you on Friday to outline why our new deal allows this country to take back control, get Brexit done and let the country move on. I have made clear that I do not want more delay. European leaders have made clear they do not want more delay. It is to my great regret that today the House has voted for more delay. The public want us to get Brexit done so the country can move on. The best thing for the United Kingdom and the European Union is for us to leave with this new deal on 31 October. I will not negotiate a delay with the European Union. I will tell the EU what I have told the British public for my 88 days as prime minister: further delay is not a solution. That is why next week this government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the European Union with our great new deal on 31 October. It is quite possible that our friends in the European Union will reject parliament\u2019s request for further delay (or not take a decision quickly). In these circumstances, I hope colleagues on all sides of the House will \u2013 faced with a choice of our new deal or no deal \u2013 support this new deal. Colleagues, more than three years after the British people voted to leave the European Union, they expect us to finally deliver on our promises. They expect us to get Brexit done, so we can all move on and focus on the people\u2019s priorities. I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on 31 October so the country can move on \u2013 and I hope I can count on your support in doing so. Yours sincerely Boris Johnson",

It would be fair and reasonable to label today Sombre Sunday after Australia\u2019s meek Rugby World Cup exit. And no doubt there are plenty of sore heads among the nation\u2019s ruggers fans as they sober up to the realisation that, yet again, this is not the Wallabies\u2019 year. But unlike my eldest son, who yesterday stacked his new, and rather expensive, mountain bike after a tree \u201ccame out of nowhere\u201d, I prefer to look at what\u2019s ahead of me, not at what\u2019s behind me. So I hereby dub this Sensational Sunday, and diners do we have some sporting treats on the menu. Any second now the third instalment of netball\u2019s 2019 <strong>Constellation Cup </strong>will begin, with the series level between Australia and New Zealand; there is a feast of <strong>WBBL</strong> action to gorge on, with Stars v Hurricanes, Thunder v Heat and Strikers v Renegades to be decided; in the <strong>A-League</strong> Melbourne City will host Adelaide United before Sydney FC and Wellington lock horns; and later on the <strong>Rugby World Cup </strong>quarter-finals continue with Wales taking on France and Japan facing South Africa (both to be documented in separate liveblogs). Sensational, indeed.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T02:14:46.199Z\">at 3.14am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for your company today. Plenty going on all over the country from the Silver Ferns pinching the Constellation Cup lead down to Sydney FC doing just enough to hold off the Wellington Phoenix. In between we had the news of Michael Cheika\u2019s decision to quit the Wallabies and the emergence of a 16-year old in the WBBL. Let\u2019s hope for more of the same when we come back to do it all again next weekend. Rugby: Wales 20-19 France - After the walkovers of Saturday, the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals get a barnburner on Sunday. Rugby: 76 mins: Wales 20-19 France - Sacre bleu! Rugby: 70 mins: Wales 13-19 France - Into the closing stages of the Rugby World Cup, France clinging on. The champions got away with that one. Second best for large spells against an unfancied Wellington, there are obvious problems with Sydney FC\u2019s new line-up and the shape it is adopting. They still leave Leichhardt Oval with three points though and they have started the new A-League season with back-to-back wins. That was a promising showing from the Nix after their drab opening round defeat. They are pointless from two matches but on today\u2019s showing they will pick up results soon enough, especially once Gary Hooper adds some much needed potency to the forward line. A-League: 90+3 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - Piscopo drills a low free-kick from 30m out through the defensive wall but wide of Redmayne\u2019s goal. Is that the last chance for an equaliser? A-League: 90+2 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - Barbarouses misses with a snapshot after a long and creative lead-up featuring a stack of Sky Blues. A-League: 90+1 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - Into the first of four minutes of added time and Sydney are finally asserting themselves on these closing stages. A-League: 87 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - One of those subs, Piscopo, shoots straight at Redmayne when he should have done better. That\u2019s followed by another sub, Ivanovic, looping a header into Marinovic\u2019s opening arms. A-League: 85 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - A couple of substitutes have just disrupted the tempo of this one as we enter the closing stages. A-League: 82 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - The Nix are committed to the equaliser now, even with ten men, which means they are open to the counter. Sydney should make it three from one of these when Ninkovic carries the ball almost the length of the pitch without being challenged before shooting wide when, for the second time tonight, Le Fondre is ignored with a tap-in on offer. A-League: 80 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - RED CARD (Cacace) - Once VAR was engaged there was only one outcome. In real time it looked like a mistimed challenge in a 50:50 on the wing. On replay you can see the Nix wingback going well over the ball and stamping firmly on Caceres\u2019 outstretched leg. A-League: 80 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - VAR check... Cacace could be in trouble for a late challenge on Caceres. A-League: GOAL! (Grant) 77 mins: Sydney FC 2-1 Wellington - Caceres does well to earn a free-kick in a decent crossing area on the right wing and from that low O\u2019Neill delivery Grant somehow gets to the front of the pack to hook his right foot under the ball and loop it over Marinovic. Barely deserved, but Sydney are back in front. A-League: 74 mins: Sydney FC 1-1 Wellington - Caceres is on for Baumjohann; a substitution I reckon you\u2019ll see often this season. Corica adding an extra body into his overworked and undermanned midfield. A-League: 73 mins: Sydney FC 1-1 Wellington - Sydney are just committed to the counterattack now - which seems odd considering their array of attacking midfielders - but Barbarouses again takes the wrong option. He has made a number of poor choices tonight. Rugby: 50 mins: Wales 10-19 France - France are down to 14 men for good! Can Wales capitalise in the closing half hour? A-League: GOAL! (Davila) 69 mins: Sydney FC 1-1 Wellington - And there it is! Davila with a very nice finish, cutting in on his left foot and drilling a low finish from just inside the box and beyond Redmayne after lovely build-up play down the right from Sotirio. Nothing less than Wellington deserve. A-League: 68 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - McCowatt has shown flashes of his potential down the left and he impresses again, skinning Brattan then whipping in a cross that\u2019s deflected, forcing Redmayne into conceding a corner. From that set-piece Rufer is millimetres away from the equaliser with a glancing header. The Phoenix have deserved a goal. A-League: 66 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - A break in play while Ryan McGowan receives treatment after falling awkwardly at a corner. A-League: 63 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Good save from Marinovic to repel a Le Fondre shot from the edge of the box after good work from Ninkovic on the counterattack. Despite the scoreline Wellington will take the most away from this game as it stands. After that opening burst from the home side the Nix have controlled the tempo and Sydney\u2019s inability respond in general play will be a cause for concern for Steve Corica. That midfield dup of O\u2019Neill and Brillante have just been overrun, with little support from Ninkovic or Baumjohann, the latter also making matters worse by giving the ball away cheaply on a number of occasions. A-League: 60 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Since about the 15-minute mark the game has been played on Wellington\u2019s terms. If they had a little more class in the forward half of the field they would probably be comfortably ahead by now. As it is they remain behind and the empty space where Sydney\u2019s midfield should be continues to go unpunished. A-League: 57 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Sweeping counterattack from Wellington and it ends when Cacace is felled inside the box but the referee waves play on. At first view that looked give-able without being stone dead. VAR has given it the all clear. Let-off for Sydney. The replay indicates it\u2019s very Lucas Neill / Fabio Grosso. A-League: 53 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Another decent spell from Wellington with the visitors camped in Sydney territory but the best they can muster is a Rufer drive charged down before it reached Redmayne. This has been a fun game. A-League: 50 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Wowee! How did that stay out!? Wellington should be level after Ball strikes the inside of the left-hand upright, following up Redmayne\u2019s save from Davila\u2019s shot. End-to-end stuff at Leichhardt Oval. A-League: 49 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Sydney should be two-up and Le Fondre has every right to cross Barbarouses off his Christmas card list. After sumptuous skill from Baumjohann just after halfway the Kiwi flyer was through on the Nix defence but he opted to shoot when Le Fondre had a tap-in a few yards to his left. Good save by Marinovic to be fair but selfish from Barbarouses. A-League: 46 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Back underway at Leichhardt Oval, and there\u2019s an immediate penalty shout with the ball striking the arm of Steven Taylor, but appeals are rightly waved away. Rugby: HT: Wales 10-19 France - All to play for in the second half. WBBL: Confirmation of Phoebe Litchfield\u2019s extraordinary performance earlier for Sydney Thunder. Rugby: 33 mins: Wales 10-19 France - And France take immediate advantage of their numerical supremacy. Rugby: 30 mins: Wales 10-12 France - Wales have clawed their way back into this Rugby World Cup quarter-final, but they are down to 14 men for the next ten minutes following Moriarty\u2019s yellow card. A-League: HT: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - A surprisingly even first-half at Leichhardt Oval. Sydney\u2019s attacking combinations clicked early and threatened to cut through the Nix at every opportunity but a tactical rejig has seen Wellington grow into the contest and create the more promising openings in the past 20-25 minutes. A-League: 44 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Sydney drill a few balls in the box from wide areas but Wellington\u2019s defence stands firm. The Nix then sweep down the other end in a flowing move that ends with Ball dinking over a cross for Sotirio to plant a free header to Redmayne\u2019s left but the Socceroo keeper flies and paws the ball around the post. Superb shot-stopping. A-League: 41 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Sydney break a couple of times down the left but the Nix remain compact in defence and deny the onrushing ball-carrier any obvious outlets. A-League: 39 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Lovely work in tight areas by Sydney - Le Fondre, Ninkovic and Baumjohann all involved - but they eventually ran out of space with Wellington doing well to deny any space behind their back four. A-League: 38 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - First yellow card of the match goes to Steinmann for being a smidgen late in a 50:50 with Le Fondre in the middle of the park. A-League: 35 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - The visitors remain the team dictating terms and have recently fashioned decent openings down both flanks but delivery from he overlapping fullbacks has been found wanting. A-League: 30 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - The Phoenix have had the better of the past ten minutes, figuring out that if they drop off and allow Sydney to play out from the back there is a dislocation between Brattan and O\u2019Neill and the Sky Blues\u2019 front four, creating the opportunity for a turnover and control of possession in that space. Despite the best efforts of Ball and McCowatt they\u2019ve been unable to create a clear cut shooting opportunity from that tactical advantage. Rugby: 13 mins: Wales 7-12 France - It\u2019s all happening in Japan. A-League: 25 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Half-chances at both ends with Ball the most noteworthy, the Nix forward swivelling sharply but not getting much purchase on his shot towards Redmayne. Wellington are enjoying plenty of possession in midfield where Sydney seem happy to be undermanned for the time being and exploit the spaces behind on the counter. Against higher quality teams in possession it will be a high-risk strategy. Rugby: 8 mins: Wales 0-12 France - Two early tries to France in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final. You can follow all that right here: A-League: 21 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Almost an immediate equaliser for Wellington. Ball does brilliantly down the left, skinning Grant and driving into the box but his cross hits Davila without the Mexican reacting swiftly enough to divert the ball beyond Redmayne who clutches the ball gratefully on his goal-line. A-League: GOAL! (O\u2019Neill) 17 min: Sydney FC 1-0 Wellington - Brandon O\u2019Neill opens the scoring for Sydney. Corner from the right is only cleared as far as the edge of the box where O\u2019Neill stabs a left-footed effort goalwards. That shot deflects back to him ending with a more successful snapshot that smuggles its way into the back of the net. A-League: 12 min: Sydney FC 0-0 Wellington - It\u2019s an open, end-to-end match so far at Leichhardt Oval. Not a lot of sideways probing in midfield. That means Sydney look dangerous in attack but vulnerable to the counter. Wellington have had enough opportunities to mount decent attacks but there\u2019s a lack of composure in their final third. From Sydney\u2019s viewpoint this XI is a much more attacking prospect than the one that won the championship last season. Brattan for Brillante in midfield and the addition of Baumjohann further forward - a man not renowned for his defensive work-rate - means the Sky Blues look exciting creatively but much more porous than the machine created by Graham Arnold and inherited by Steve Corica. A-League: 9 min: Sydney FC 0-0 Wellington - Sydney are moving the ball beautifully from back to front, finding their key playmakers with ease. The latest attack ends with Le Fondre shielding the ball well in the box before teeing up Grant who lashes the ball over the bar. A-League: 7 min: Sydney FC 0-0 Wellington - First corner of the game goes to the Nix but the first phase of play it generates comes to nought. Wellington retain possession from the clearance though and recycle the ball well to fashion a shot that doesn\u2019t trouble Redmayne. A-League: 4 min: Sydney FC 0-0 Wellington - Grant has been everywhere in the opening minutes, linking well with Baumjohann down the right to nip into the box once more. The quality of the interplay in Sydney\u2019s final third is superb. A-League: 1 min: Sydney FC 0-0 Wellington - Sydney almost opening the scoring inside a minute. That fearsome looking attacking unit combined well before Grant hit the penalty area on the burst but his cross was smuggled away. Bright start from the home side. Some stats to chew over as the opening whistle blows and the match gets underway... Sydney FC have won seven of their last nine A-League games against Wellington Phoenix (D1, L1), including their last two on the bounce by scores of 1-0. There has been an average of four goals per game scored between Sydney FC and Wellington Phoenix in their last five A-League games hosted by the Sky Blues, with only one clean sheet kept in that time (to Sydney FC). This will be just the fourth A-League game played at Leichhardt Oval, with Sydney FC having picked up a win, draw, and loss there thus far. Wellington Phoenix have lost their last three A-League games on the bounce; the last time they lost more in succession in the competition was an eight-game stretch from March-October 2016. Sydney are bolstered by the returns from international duty of Andrew Redmayne and Rhyan Grant. Teenage fullback Joel King can probably count himself unlucky to make way for Grant with Paolo Retre shifting from the right to the left side of defence. Hooper\u2019s first A-League goal will have to wait because he\u2019s not ready to make his Nix debut. Former Sydney FC assistant coach Ufuk Talay has therefore gone with the same XI that lost to Western United last time out Now it\u2019s time to keep an eye on the final A-League fixture of the round between Sydney FC and Wellington Phoenix from Leichhardt Oval. The home side will start unbackable favourites of course. Reigning champions, winners interstate last week, and boasting a squad full of attacking talent, the Sky Blues are the early standout side this season. Sydney sneaked past Adelaide last time out but the awesome potential of their front four of Adam Le Fondre, Kosta Barabrouses, Milos Ninkovic and Alex Baumjohann was there for all to see. The more minutes that quartet play together the greater their understanding will become, and the highlights will surely follow. The Phoenix by contrast were losers at home last week, a result that provided early confirmation of preseason predictions the much-changed Wellington squad could struggle this year. Hopes were raised earlier this week though with the signing of former Celtic forward Gary Hooper. Still only 31, the Englishman knows his way to goal, as the following stat (nicked from Wikipedia) testifies: he has scored in the Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two, Conference National, Conference South, FA Cup, League Cup, Football League Trophy, FA Trophy, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Premier League. The A-League would of course be the most cherished addition possible to that roll call. Here\u2019s your first draft of the Michael Cheika news: WBBL update time... In Melbourne, an uneaten 60 from Nicola Carey has guided the Hurricanes to victory against the Stars. The visitors chased 137 with nine balls to spare. In Sydney, the Thunder chased Heat\u2019s 150 with seven balls remaining. Alex Blackwell was unbeaten on 42, but she was overshadowed by 16 year old Phoebe Litchfield who stroked a composed 52. In Adelaide, the Renegades hunted down the Strikers\u2019 152 with an over up their sleeves. The English pair of Danni Wyatt (61) and Tammy Beaumont (41) delivered. Melbourne City take the spoils courtesy of Jamie Maclaren\u2019s first-half brace. It was far from a vintage performance in a match that struggled for tempo at times, especially in the second half. Maclaren\u2019s finishing was the difference with both sides fashioning decent opportunities. Adelaide didn\u2019t disgrace themselves but looked vulnerable to balls in behind them in defence and, not for the first time in recent seasons, lacked a cutting edge in the penalty area. They will hope to find their shooting boots on Wednesday they host City in the FFA Cup final. A-League: 90 mins: Melbourne City 2-1 Adelaide United - Ooh, that was almost the equaliser! Toure does superbly down the left, jinking his way to the byline then almost finding Opseth with his cutback but Windbichler just gets a toe in the way to deny the shooting opportunity. A-League: 89 mins: Melbourne City 2-1 Adelaide United - The game has become a little ragged as bodies tire in the closing stages. Connor Metcalfe did his best to rouse the crowd from its slumber but he could only belt the ball over the bar from the edge of the box. Metcalfe is some player though. Still only 19 and now a fixture in the heart of City\u2019s midfield showing plenty of maturity and no little skill in these early rounds. A-League: 83 mins: Melbourne City 2-1 Adelaide United - United are pushing hard for that equaliser. Nathan Konstandopoulos has just forced a fine diving save from Dean Bouzanis after stepping inside and driving hard and low on his right foot. A-League: 75 mins: Melbourne City 2-1 Adelaide United - Back in the A-League Melbourne City should be two-up but Noone wasted a glorious opportunity after a flowing move. The City flyer is not fully fit though after a knock earlier in the half. Adelaide have impressed in the second half and an equaliser would not be unfair on them given the balance of play. Thank you very much Scott. Massive - if unsurprising news there from Scott in his dismount. Michael Cheika will not continue as coach of the Wallabies. Expect plenty more on that shortly. And I now leave you in the capable hands of Jonathan Howcroft. Thanks for your company today but it\u2019s not over yet. Over to you, Jonathan. As a parting gift, I can confirm that Wallabies coach Michael Cheika won\u2019t be seeking reappointment. Watch this space. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne City 2-1 Adelaide United (McGree, 67 mins) Another Mac (OK, Mc) finds the net but it\u2019s not the one City fans want. The home defence suddenly looks stretched and Marrone sets up McGree, who drills the ball low past Bouzanis to half the deficit. Moments later, McGree is found again on his own in the box but this time his shot goes wide. The Rugby World What? Oh yes, I can confirm that the tournament will be continuing despite Australia\u2019s exit. Next up it\u2019s Wales v France. A-League: 61 mins: Melbourne City 2-0 Adelaide United Two more clear chances for Maclaren but he squanders both, and with them the opportunity to bury Adelaide good and proper. Does this man have the ball on a string? City make their second substitution of the match, replacing Wales with Brillante. A-League: 50 mins: Melbourne City 2-0 Adelaide United Two changes to start the second half, with City exchanging Najjarine for Cabrera and Adelaide making the forced switch of Abetew (injury) for Brook. Play is held up for several minutes as the busy Noone goes down with what appears a knee injury. City fans breathe a sigh of relief as the winger gets up and carries on. A-League: HT: Melbourne City 2-0 Adelaide United Adelaide did have a chance or two in the latter parts of the first half - including a close-range shot from Maria which was stopped by Bouzanis - but the opening 45 minutes were all about City and one man in particular, Jamie Maclaren. Two goals in the space of five minutes from the Socceroos striker has blown this game wide open. Seriously, is there a hotter marksman in the country? WBBL update, anyone? In Melbourne, the Hurricanes are 98-5 in the 16th over chasing 137 for victory against the Stars. The visitors will look to Carey, unbeaten on 41, to carry them home. In Sydney, the Thunder are 82-3 after 12 overs in response to the Heat\u2019s 150-9. Stalenberg and Priest put on 48 for the opening wicket to get the home side off to a good start in their reply. In Adelaide, Wyatt is 61 not out off 36 balls with the Renegades 83-1 after 11 overs in pursuit of 153 for victory against the Strikers. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne City 2-0 Adelaide United (Maclaren, 28 mins) Maclaren gets his second, barely five minutes after his first. A set piece drill from a corner sees Jamieson feed the ball into dangerous areas and Adelaide can\u2019t clear, leaving Jamie-on-the-spot to tap the ball home from metres out. Floodgates. Open. Maclaren. Superstar. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne City 1-0 Adelaide United (Maclaren, 23 mins) Metcalfe instrumental in the goal that was definitely coming, forcing the United defence to overcommit before Najjarine sets up man-of-the-moment Maclaren, who slots it past Izzo from close range. A-League: 14 mins: Melbourne City 0-0 Adelaide United United now starting to settle from the early City onslaught, Abetew skipping past two on the right wing before sending the ball into the box and winning the Reds a corner. A-League: 6 mins: Melbourne City 0-0 Adelaide United It\u2019s Metcalfe this time who slices through the Adelaide defence, leaving Najjarine with a clear shot on goal. His shot low to the keeper\u2019s left is just kept out by Izzo, who doesn\u2019t take the ball cleanly but gathers in the nick of time. Ominous signs early from the home side. A-League: 2 mins: Melbourne City 0-0 Adelaide United A bright chance early in the game for City goes begging, with Noone\u2019s fancy footwork setting up an attacking foray but ultimately Najjarine and Noone can\u2019t connect in front of goal. At AAMI Park, the A-League encounter between Melbourne City and Adelaide United is about to get under way. And what do you know, it serves as something of a precursor to the FFA Cup final between these teams on Wednesday. Melbourne City (4-3-3) - Dean Bouzanis (GK); Scott Galloway, Harrison Delbridge, Richard Windbichler, Scott Jamieson; Ramy Najjarine, Rostyn Griffiths, Connor Metcalfe; Lachlan Wales, Jamie Maclaren, Craig Noone. Subs: Tom Glover (GK), Joshua Brillante, Marcelo Cabrera, Nathaniel Atkinson, Adrian Luna, Curtis Good, Moudi Najjar. Adelaide United (4-2-3-1) - Paul Izzo (GK); Yared Abetew, Michael Marrone, Michael Jakobsen, Ryan Kitto; Louis D\u2019Arrigo, Vince Lia; Michael Maria, Riley McGree, Nikola Mileusnic; Kristian Fardal Opseth. Subs: Isaac Richards (GK), Nathan Konstandopoulos, Lachlan Brook, Al Hassan Toure. Our boundary riders around the country are an intrepid lot. They\u2019ve been monitoring the day\u2019s WBBL action and here\u2019s an update: In Melbourne, the Stars finished their 20 overs on a thin-looking 136-7. Lee\u2019s 25 at the top of the order was the best the hosts could muster. In response, the Hurricanes are 18-0 after two overs. In Sydney, the Heat recovered somewhat from a mid-innings slump to post 150-9 against the Thunder, Jonassen\u2019s 42 off 34 balls instrumental. In Adelaide, the Strikers top-order were in fine fettle as the hosts tallied 152-5 from their 20 overs against the Renegades. Each of the top four made at least 24, with Devine\u2019s 48 the best of the lot. Megan Maurice was an eye witness to that Constellation Cup classic at Qudos Bank Arena and has been kind enough to treat us all to this ripping match report. I do suggest you read it. And it\u2019s time to go around the grounds in the WBBL... In Melbourne, the Stars are going along nicely at 72-3 in the 11th over. Lee and Inglis both got to 20 or beyond but were removed by Hurricanes medium-pacer Carey. In Sydney, the Heat have been pegged back after their blistering start. Having been 44 without loss in the sixth over, the Heat are now 94-5 after 12 with Thunder seamer Bates taking three wickets. In Adelaide, the Strikers are humming along after winning the toss against the Renegades. The hosts are 56-0 in the eighth over, with Bates and Devine scoring at will. Wow. Both teams had their chance to ice the game but in the end it\u2019s the Silver Ferns who hold their nerve the better. Ekenasio netted the winner barely 20 seconds from time and Australia could do nothing with their last chance to level the scores. The series now heads to Perth, with New Zealand 2-1 up and in the box seat to take the crown for the first time since 2012. A great comeback by the Silver Ferns after trailing for much of the game. Constellation Cup: Q4: 3 mins rem: Australia 52-52 New Zealand I have nothing to add... Constellation Cup: Q4: 11 mins rem: Australia 45-48 New Zealand New Zealand have started the final 15 minutes much the brighter, forcing errors from Australia and capitalising on the turnovers. The stage is set for a gripping finale. What are you made of, Australia? Constellation Cup: 3QT: Australia 43-42 New Zealand I can\u2019t look. And I can\u2019t take my eyes off it. This game was lively enough in the first half but energy levels leapt off the dial in that third stanza. A great comeback by New Zealand, but after falling behind it\u2019s Australia who enter the final term with a narrow advantage. Back to the WBBL, and the Stars have recovered from that early loss to be 25-1 in the fourth over. Over in Sydney, Brisbane Heat won the toss against the Thunder and are making hay in the sun to be 41-0 after five overs. Jolly good. Constellation Cup: Q3: 10 mins rem: Australia 31-34 New Zealand Sport, glorious sport. After looking dead in the water, the Silver Ferns have come out breathing fire in this third quarter. On the back of a five-goal run, a four-goal half-time deficit has been transformed into a three-goal lead. Folau again pivotal under the net. In Melbourne, the day\u2019s WBBL action has commenced. Hobart Hurricanes won the toss and elected to field against Melbourne Stars. And it was an eventful first over. After twice whacking Villani to the fence, Vakarewa perished to said bowler, caught on the fifth ball of the match. You live by the sword, you die by the sword. Apparently. Constellation Cup: HT: Australia 30-26 New Zealand Again Australia threatened to blow this match apart but again New Zealand refuse to lie down. More sterling work from Tippett saw the Diamonds push out to a six-goal break, but (with Tippett off) some desperate hustle from the Silver Ferns sees them trail by just four goals at the long break. Still, Australia look to be dominating field possession and are passing the ball at relative will. If the trend continues, New Zealand will do well to remain in touch in the second half. Australia shooting at 88%, New Zealand at 93% to stay in the game. So if rugby players play for a World Cup purse of $13 million, a horse race can be worth $14 million and chess players go at it for $430,000, what do the world\u2019s elite starers earn? Strangely, the game\u2019s ruling body has always been quiet when it comes to these details. Constellation Cup: QT: Australia 16-13 New Zealand OK, so the Diamonds threatened to put a big gap on New Zealand during that first stanza but the Silver Ferns fought back to trim the deficit to three at the break, Folau netting from long range in the closing seconds. Tippett is shooting at 100% from nine attempts for Australia. Don\u2019t know about you but I love a bit of chess. Over in the Isle of Man, where else, two fellas are about to move some objects around a board with the one who does it better to trouser an absurd amount of money. I had no idea there was so much coin in chess. Constellation Cup: Q1, 7 mins rem: Australia 10-4 New Zealand Although we were slated for a 1pm (EDT) start in Sydney, proceedings didn\u2019t begin until close to 20 past the hour. But that\u2019s fine. National anthems are an absolute must at these events. Eight minutes in and it\u2019s all Australia. The Silver Ferns have committed three turnovers with Australia going on a five-goal run. I really don\u2019t like to dwell on the negative, or pick at the carcass of the vanquished, but what of those Wallabies, eh? It would be nice, even comforting, to say their campaign at least promised something, but in truth it was spluttering from the beginning. So while I hate to be a Sunday\u2019s expert, perhaps the job England did on them wasn\u2019t so much of a surprise. Regardless, Michael Cheika looks to be done and dusted. Bret Harris has penned a delightful piece on the embattled Australia coach. Do yourself a favour. Good afternoon, sports fans. It would be fair and reasonable to label today Sombre Sunday after Australia\u2019s meek Rugby World Cup exit. And no doubt there are plenty of sore heads among the nation\u2019s ruggers fans as they sober up to the realisation that, yet again, this is not the Wallabies\u2019 year. But unlike my eldest son, who yesterday stacked his new, and rather expensive, mountain bike after a tree \u201ccame out of nowhere\u201d, I prefer to look at what\u2019s ahead of me, not at what\u2019s behind me. So I hereby dub this Sensational Sunday, and diners do we have some sporting treats on the menu. Any second now the third instalment of netball\u2019s 2019 Constellation Cup will begin, with the series level between Australia and New Zealand; there is a feast of WBBL action to gorge on, with Stars v Hurricanes, Thunder v Heat and Strikers v Renegades to be decided; in the A-League Melbourne City will host Adelaide United before Sydney FC and Wellington lock horns; and later on the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals continue with Wales taking on France and Japan facing South Africa (both to be documented in separate liveblogs). Sensational, indeed.",

With six minutes to go, a 14-man France were threatening to wreck Gatland\u2019s final tournament as the Wales coach, only for a scrambled close-range try from the replacement Ross Moriarty to propel his team into a semi-final against South Africa.</p> \n<p>There would almost certainly have been a different outcome had the 49th-minute dismissal of the second-row forward S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina not completely transformed a breathless contest. Nine points ahead and in the middle of an attacking maul within range of the Wales line, the Clermont lock caught the jaw of Aaron Wainwright with a blatant elbow, leaving the referee, Jaco Peyper, no option but to show him a red card. The last time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/15/wales-france-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">Wales played France in a World Cup knockout match</a> a red card for Sam Warburton proved to be the decisive moment and Gatland was among those to highlight the irony. Before Vahaamahina\u2019s rush of blood, France had been playing some of the most beguiling rugby of the tournament, inspired by their half-backs Romain Ntamack and Antoine Dupont and the pacy duo of Virimi Vakatawa and Damian Penaud. If ever there was a rugby-themed version of beauty and the beast, this was it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e59a9f6f-4cec-4af6-bcc4-d9016ab785b0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cSu2Fhe5Qb8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Even Wales\u2019s winning try was contentious, the ball having been ripped from the grasp of the flanker Charles Ollivon by the replacement Wales scrum-half Tomos Williams and appearing to go forward before Justin Tipuric and, finally, Moriarty lunged for the line. After a lengthy debate with the TMO and numerous replays Peyper decided there was no clear evidence that the ball had gone forward from Williams to Tipuric and that Moriarty had touched the ball down legitimately.</p> \n<p>It was another high-profile example of the tiny margins that can transform careers.

      "bodyText": "Wales have not played this poorly for the past 18 months but in World Cup knockout games the final scoreline is everything. Warren Gatland\u2019s side are into the last four, 80 minutes away from becoming the first Welsh team to make the final. If they enjoy as much good fortune as they did against France, the Gatland era may yet have a storybook ending. This will certainly go down among the crazier quarter-finals of modern times. With six minutes to go, a 14-man France were threatening to wreck Gatland\u2019s final tournament as the Wales coach, only for a scrambled close-range try from the replacement Ross Moriarty to propel his team into a semi-final against South Africa. There would almost certainly have been a different outcome had the 49th-minute dismissal of the second-row forward S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina not completely transformed a breathless contest. Nine points ahead and in the middle of an attacking maul within range of the Wales line, the Clermont lock caught the jaw of Aaron Wainwright with a blatant elbow, leaving the referee, Jaco Peyper, no option but to show him a red card. The last time Wales played France in a World Cup knockout match a red card for Sam Warburton proved to be the decisive moment and Gatland was among those to highlight the irony. Before Vahaamahina\u2019s rush of blood, France had been playing some of the most beguiling rugby of the tournament, inspired by their half-backs Romain Ntamack and Antoine Dupont and the pacy duo of Virimi Vakatawa and Damian Penaud. If ever there was a rugby-themed version of beauty and the beast, this was it. Even Wales\u2019s winning try was contentious, the ball having been ripped from the grasp of the flanker Charles Ollivon by the replacement Wales scrum-half Tomos Williams and appearing to go forward before Justin Tipuric and, finally, Moriarty lunged for the line. After a lengthy debate with the TMO and numerous replays Peyper decided there was no clear evidence that the ball had gone forward from Williams to Tipuric and that Moriarty had touched the ball down legitimately. It was another high-profile example of the tiny margins that can transform careers. If they go on to win the World Cup, Wales will be tempted to declare 20 October a public holiday and toast Peyper on an annual basis. France had every right to feel totally gutted. Every now and again they spring gloriously to life at World Cups and here was another example. One glance at a pumped-up Guilhem Guirado squeezing the mascot tight during the anthems was enough to realise Wales, who lost Jonathan Davies to a knee problem on the eve of the game, could expect a proper contest and France had two tries on the board inside the first eight minutes.

There\u2019s a disparity right now: there\u2019s a lot of young kids that are doing things \u2013 they have the free time and aren\u2019t saddled by exhaustion and work \u2013 and wealthy older people.

People have read about psychotherapy and our subconscious relationship to sex, but this just makes it so funny and enlightening. It\u2019s a refreshing, very psychological take on people\u2019s dynamics and relationships and how those formative years start the course of the rest of your life. It\u2019s got layers of meaning, besides being really funny. There\u2019s a character called the Shame Wizard that comes out, a little after the Hormone Monster shows up, to make them all feel ashamed \u2013 I think that\u2019s really cute.</p> <h2>4.

She has developed so much as a songwriter \u2013 she isn\u2019t afraid to use quieter acoustic elements and really dramatic language. I think she\u2019s a true outsider, and one of the last alternative artists that are as big as something like Nirvana. People love to criticise her: they think she\u2019s this calculated creation but, having worked with her, she\u2019s so authentically who she is. The song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocKrWwWeHLQ\" title=\"\">Bartender</a> is my favourite on the album \u2013 I know a lot of girls who have fallen in love with their bartenders.

      "bodyText": "Born in California in 1988, as a teenager Natalie Mering began performing music under the name Wise Blood, taken from a Flannery O\u2019Connor novel, later changing the spelling to Weyes Blood. She was active in the noise underground scene in Portland and Baltimore before releasing her solo debut, The Outside Room, in 2011. She has since released three more albums, including Front Row Seat To Earth (2016) and this year\u2019s acclaimed Titanic Rising. She plays in Glasgow on 28 October, Manchester on 29 October and London on 30 October. 1. Art Ram Han She\u2019s an incredible artist from Seoul, South Korea, who makes really beautiful digital paintings. I first saw her artwork in the Editorial Magazine, a little homespun publication from Montreal. She draws a lot of weird bedroom scenes of women and girls, very surrealist \u2013 almost like a psychedelic video game or something. I love her art\u2019s beauty and femininity: it has a lot of pinks and it\u2019s very shiny. It kind of looks like candy. There\u2019s one I love where there\u2019s a woman crying over a young girl crying on a bed. 2. Activism Global climate protests I was excited to find out that Paul McCartney recently endorsed Greta Thunberg to get an award, and Jane Fonda got arrested for protesting climate change. I appreciate the boomers re-entering the scene and bolstering up the kids. I feel like it\u2019s vital for them to get on board, considering that we\u2019re still under the weight of their influence. There\u2019s a disparity right now: there\u2019s a lot of young kids that are doing things \u2013 they have the free time and aren\u2019t saddled by exhaustion and work \u2013 and wealthy older people. We need to fill in that middle zone. 3. TV Big Mouth (Netflix) Big Mouth is an adult cartoon show about kids in seventh grade who are going through puberty. People have read about psychotherapy and our subconscious relationship to sex, but this just makes it so funny and enlightening. It\u2019s a refreshing, very psychological take on people\u2019s dynamics and relationships and how those formative years start the course of the rest of your life. It\u2019s got layers of meaning, besides being really funny. There\u2019s a character called the Shame Wizard that comes out, a little after the Hormone Monster shows up, to make them all feel ashamed \u2013 I think that\u2019s really cute. 4. Album Norman Fucking Rockwell! by Lana Del Rey It\u2019s a beautiful piece of work. She has developed so much as a songwriter \u2013 she isn\u2019t afraid to use quieter acoustic elements and really dramatic language. I think she\u2019s a true outsider, and one of the last alternative artists that are as big as something like Nirvana. People love to criticise her: they think she\u2019s this calculated creation but, having worked with her, she\u2019s so authentically who she is. The song Bartender is my favourite on the album \u2013 I know a lot of girls who have fallen in love with their bartenders. It\u2019s such a romantic, relatable narrative arc. 5. Project 350m trees planted in Ethiopia This was a remarkable project: as part of a reforestation campaign, millions of Ethiopians planted 350m trees in 12 hours. It\u2019s a place where I\u2019m sure there\u2019s not as much expendable time and income as might exist in America, so I\u2019d like to imagine what we could do if we all decided to \u2013 how many billions of trees we could plant. There is an argument about whether or not this is the most efficient solution, but I think any little thing you could possibly do, you should. Taking action and doing these simple things \u2013 I think that\u2019s really admirable. 6. Book Attached, by Dr Amir Levine and Rachel SF Heller It\u2019s a book about attachment theory, and one of the more informative books I\u2019ve read in terms of understanding how you bond with people in a romantic relationship. There\u2019s a big myth that co-dependency is a negative thing, that self-reliance is the ultimate structure of perfection. But we were biologically built to be co-dependent, and that\u2019s a very beautiful thing \u2013 the negative aspects of co-dependency have more to do with different attachment styles. It\u2019s a really important read for anybody interested in long-term monogamy, or just being in a healthy relationship.",

      "body": "<p>Some years and several books ago, the <em>New Yorker</em> journalist Malcolm Gladwell moved from being a talented writer to a cultural phenomenon. He has practically invented a genre of nonfiction writing: the finely turned counterintuitive narrative underpinned by social science studies. Or if not the inventor then someone so closely associated with the form that it could fall under the title of Gladwellian.</p> <p>His latest book, <em>Talking to Strangers</em>, is a typically roundabout exploration of the assumptions and mistakes we make when dealing with people we don\u2019t know. If that sounds like a rather vague area of study, that\u2019s because in many respects it is \u2013 there are all manner of definitional and cultural issues through which Gladwell boldly navigates a rather convenient path. But in doing so he crafts a compelling story, stopping off at prewar appeasement, paedophilia, espionage, the TV show <em>Friends</em>, the Amanda Knox and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/26/bernard-madoff-believers-financial-scam-books\" title=\"\">Bernie Madoff</a> cases, suicide and Sylvia Plath, torture and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/why-cant-we-get-this-over-911-hearings-drag-on-guantanamo\" title=\"\">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a>, before coming to a somewhat pat conclusion.</p> <p>The tale begins with Sandra Bland, the African American woman who in July 2015 was stopped by a traffic cop in a small Texas town. She was just about to begin a job at Prairie View A&amp;M University, when a police car accelerated up behind her. Doing what almost all of us would have done, she moved aside to let the car pass. And just like most of us in that situation, she didn\u2019t bother indicating.

      "bodyText": "Some years and several books ago, the New Yorker journalist Malcolm Gladwell moved from being a talented writer to a cultural phenomenon. He has practically invented a genre of nonfiction writing: the finely turned counterintuitive narrative underpinned by social science studies. Or if not the inventor then someone so closely associated with the form that it could fall under the title of Gladwellian. His latest book, Talking to Strangers, is a typically roundabout exploration of the assumptions and mistakes we make when dealing with people we don\u2019t know. If that sounds like a rather vague area of study, that\u2019s because in many respects it is \u2013 there are all manner of definitional and cultural issues through which Gladwell boldly navigates a rather convenient path. But in doing so he crafts a compelling story, stopping off at prewar appeasement, paedophilia, espionage, the TV show Friends, the Amanda Knox and Bernie Madoff cases, suicide and Sylvia Plath, torture and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, before coming to a somewhat pat conclusion. The tale begins with Sandra Bland, the African American woman who in July 2015 was stopped by a traffic cop in a small Texas town. She was just about to begin a job at Prairie View A&amp;M University, when a police car accelerated up behind her. Doing what almost all of us would have done, she moved aside to let the car pass. And just like most of us in that situation, she didn\u2019t bother indicating. It was on that technicality that the cop, Brian Encinia, ordered her to pull over. Agitated and annoyed by Encinia\u2019s ploy, Bland lit a cigarette to calm herself down. Encinia demanded that she put it out. When she protested, he instructed her to get out of the car and, after some minor resistance on Bland\u2019s part, she was arrested and put in jail. Three days later, while still being held, she killed herself. As Gladwell notes, it was one of several high-profile incidents in which the aggressive behaviour of police officers led to shocking deaths of African Americans, thus inspiring the Black Lives Matter movement. But why, Gladwell asks, did things go so badly wrong on that Texas highway? What were the misunderstandings that led to such a needless conclusion, and where did they come from? There is a short answer to that question, and it goes something like this: in a misapplication of a criminology study, American police forces were trained to use minor traffic violations to uncover major crimes. In doing so they pathologised a whole range of normal behaviour and almost certainly exacerbated pre-existing racial bias. But while worthy of attention, that\u2019s not the kind of answer that makes for a riveting book, at least not in the hands of Gladwell. So he takes us on a digressive journey in which we are encouraged to examine our own behaviour and thought processes. What would you do, for example, if you witnessed what you thought was inappropriate interaction in a shower between a school sports coach and one of his pupils? Our best self says we\u2019d report it immediately to a person in authority. Then what does that person in authority do? Were you certain that you saw what you thought you saw? Is the person in authority certain of your certainty? And what about his or her superior? In reality most of us have a predisposition to doubt out-of-the-ordinary occurrences.

Moorhouse points in particular to Thames TV\u2019s 1970s documentary The World at War, which, throughout 26 hour-long episodes, did not feature one interview with a Pole. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd: the producers were willing to fly to Moscow to interview [Soviet General Georgy] Zhukov or to Heidelberg to meet [Hitler\u2019s ally Albert] Speer, but they didn\u2019t get the train up to Edinburgh to speak to Polish General [Stanis\u0142aw] Maczek, who settled in Britain after liberating Belgium and the Netherlands.\u201d The historian spotted that, ironically for a series trying to set the record straight, the producers of World on Fire failed to avoid repeating some Nazi and Soviet propaganda tropes that have coloured the way the Polish war has been presented. \u201cIn the first episode, there is a line that the Poles only had bicycles against tanks, which is nonsense and harks back to old Nazi propaganda myths spread to ridicule the Poles,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that in 2019 we\u2019re still parroting these narratives from 1939 is faintly ridiculous.\u201d Another eye-catching feature of World on Fire is a star-studded Polish cast who speak in subtitled Polish, which adds to the authenticity of the story.

In fairness, he might well feel cheated, since back when he was born we were gifted with so many clothes that he was covered head to toe in much nicer things. But I spent my entire childhood either wearing hand-me-downs from my eight older siblings, or freshly bought plastic shoes displaying non-copyright text like ATHLETIC SPORT 1999. Such bargains weren\u2019t just common in Derry, they were mandatory. By law, raincoats had to boast the clumpy consistency of something fashioned from melted credit cards, and teachers would do spot checks to make sure every stitch of your clothing was flammable. What need for designer T-shirts when you could support the local polyester industry for a fraction of the price? And why would anyone settle for Giorgio Armani, when there was a perfectly good George of Armagh, NI, just down the road? Clearly such tightness is hereditary, since my boy had no interest in the spangly rubberised trainers we tried in the fancy shop and cried at the pleather beauties from a fancier one still. No, my penny-pinching progeny only had eyes for a drab pair of cloth clogs, which cost \u00a36 and came in plastic tubing usually reserved for tennis balls and Pringles. I might not be a cool dad, but if he\u2019s happy to save me a few pennies, I\u2019ll let him. If that makes me a miser, I just ask you don\u2019t judge a man until you walk a mile in his ATHLETIC SPORT. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

The firm said it was fully committed to using sustainable palm oil.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also actively working with our suppliers to ensure the eradication of deforestation in the production of palm oil,\u201d said a spokesperson. It added that it was committed to eradicating human rights violations in the palm oil supply chain.</p> <p>The National Trust said it was pleased thousands of people could continue to enjoy Easter trails. \u201cCadbury has been an important partner for 12 years, and has financially supported us as well as helped develop our Easter trails into the huge success we see today,\u201d said a spokesperson. But the charity added that it would be considering other suppliers when the contract with Cadbury ended in 2021.</p> <p>Last year it emerged the National Trust invested over \u00a330m in oil, gas and mining firms, including BP and Shell, via a portfolio fund. After an outcry from environmentalists and MPs, the charity announced in July it would cease any investment in fossil fuel firms within the next three years.</p> <p>Members clashed with the trust\u2019s ruling body in 2017 when a motion to ban trail hunting on the organisation\u2019s land was only narrowly defeated by the use of proxy votes, which can be used by the discretion of other members and the trust\u2019s board.</p> <p>Earlier that same year, the trust was criticised when it dropped the word \u201cEaster\u201d from its Cadbury-branded egg hunts, with Jeremy Corbyn saying \u201ccommercialism had gone too far\u201d, and the then PM, Theresa May, saying it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d.</p>",

In the end the trust\u2019s board defeated the women\u2019s efforts by more than 7,643 votes in a ballot of the trust\u2019s more than five million members after nearly 13,000 voted to end the partnership with Cadbury and just over 20,000 voted to see out the contract. But this was not before a tempestuous debate which at one point featured Bruce Cadbury, whose great-grandfather founded the firm, who turned up to support the women. He said the company had lost its Quaker values: \u201cThe whole brand name has been diluted. I\u2019m very much in favour of terminating this [the contract with Cadbury] early.\u201d Bienzobas and Morris, who are friends and have children of a similar age, decided to take on the combined might of National Trust and Mondel\u0113z, Cadbury\u2019s parent company, while visiting one of the charity\u2019s properties last Easter. \u201cWe were incensed that a highly respected conservation charity would be using a product that is responsible for the destruction of the rainforest,\u201d said Bienzobas. The pair say they were invited to a face-to-face meeting in which the trust\u2019s most senior managers, including the director general, Hilary McGrady, begged them to withdraw the motion. But the pair pressed ahead and obtained the 50 signatures necessary to submit a motion within a week. \u201cI asked everybody I could think of at my church and at the school,\u201d said Bienzobas. The 46-year-old, who has been a lifelong member of the National Trust, broke down in tears after the result was announced. \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed that money has won yet again \u2013 because they [The National Trust] could stop this now. The rainforests are being cut down now,\u201d she said. Morris, who has volunteered in trust properties near her home, said she was heartbroken. \u201cThey had a chance with this to be a real leader on climate change and a real leader against dirty palm oil,\u201d she said. During the hour-long debate in the town\u2019s rail museum, the organisation\u2019s trustees pleaded with members not to pull out of the contract early. \u201cIf we did want to get out it would be quite a legal wrangle and it would cost several million pounds,\u201d said Sharon Pickford, the trust\u2019s director of revenue. The trust argued Mondel\u0113z had provided assurances it was addressing environmental issues. \u201cWe believe that the actions that we have in hand will address the concerns raised while being fair to a supplier who has been a valuable partner to us for many years,\u201d it said in statement. However, Bienzobas, who is a language teacher, told the 500-strong meeting that the organisation could not wait because rainforest were being cut down by Mondel\u0113z palm oil suppliers: \u201cCadbury is profiting from dirty and destructive environmental practices. Is it right that the National Trust should indirectly profit from these practices by continuing in partnership with such a company?\u201d She added that Mondel\u0113z palm oil suppliers have been accused of serious human rights abuses by Amnesty International. \u201cPalm oil suppliers to Cadbury\u2019s parent company Mondel\u0113z have also been accused of exploitation, including subjecting migrant workers to forced labour, exploiting victims of trafficking and child labour,\u201d she said. Greenpeace described the trust\u2019s position as confused and urged it break its ties to Mondel\u0113z, which it said continued to buy palm oil from producers destroying rainforest. \u201cIf the trust really wants to help tackle the climate emergency and stand by its family-friendly slogan, partnering with Cadbury is definitely not the way to do it,\u201d said Richard George, Greenpeace UK\u2019s head of forests. Mondel\u0113z said it was delighted that National Trust members had shown their support for the Cadbury partnership. The firm said it was fully committed to using sustainable palm oil. \u201cWe are also actively working with our suppliers to ensure the eradication of deforestation in the production of palm oil,\u201d said a spokesperson. It added that it was committed to eradicating human rights violations in the palm oil supply chain. The National Trust said it was pleased thousands of people could continue to enjoy Easter trails. \u201cCadbury has been an important partner for 12 years, and has financially supported us as well as helped develop our Easter trails into the huge success we see today,\u201d said a spokesperson. But the charity added that it would be considering other suppliers when the contract with Cadbury ended in 2021. Last year it emerged the National Trust invested over \u00a330m in oil, gas and mining firms, including BP and Shell, via a portfolio fund. After an outcry from environmentalists and MPs, the charity announced in July it would cease any investment in fossil fuel firms within the next three years. Members clashed with the trust\u2019s ruling body in 2017 when a motion to ban trail hunting on the organisation\u2019s land was only narrowly defeated by the use of proxy votes, which can be used by the discretion of other members and the trust\u2019s board. Earlier that same year, the trust was criticised when it dropped the word \u201cEaster\u201d from its Cadbury-branded egg hunts, with Jeremy Corbyn saying \u201ccommercialism had gone too far\u201d, and the then PM, Theresa May, saying it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d.",

Value Added, published on Sunday by the thinktank Demos, reveals that 25 of the government\u2019s 34 strategic suppliers \u2013 organisations that receive \u00a3100m or more in revenue from the government \u2013 operate in offshore centres. According to estimates, they account for about a fifth of total central government procurement spend. Of these, 19 had operations in jurisdictions included on the EU\u2019s \u201cblacklist\u201d or \u201cgreylist\u201d of countries that are considered to be non-compliant with EU international standards for \u201cgood tax behaviour\u201d, according to the report. The Labour MP and former chair of the public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, said it was \u201cperverse that the government continues to pay significant sums of taxpayer money to big corporations that practise tax avoidance on an alarming scale\u201d. There are claims that aggressive use of tax havens can distort competition. The Labour peer, Lord Haskel, added: \u201cFor too long large international tech companies have failed to pay their fair share of tax while being rewarded with government contracts, leaving British companies at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d The Demos report states: \u201cLarge multinational companies, for example, continue to squeeze their tax contributions ever lower: the OECD estimates that US$100\u2013$240bn (\u00a378bn-\u00a3186bn) is lost globally in revenue each year from base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies.\u201d Procurement is the UK government\u2019s largest expenditure, valued at \u00a3284bn.

The government has taken steps to improve the way it manages contracts with key suppliers. The report states that earlier this year, in response to the collapse of public-sector contractor Carillion and to \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d probation contracts being brought back in-house, the Cabinet Office published the Outsourcing Playbook. Its aim was to improve and strengthen the way government procures, and thereby reduce the risk of similar mishaps in the future. Demos said that there was a need for new measures \u2013 including minimum standards for public procurement to include criteria relating to a bidder\u2019s exchequer contribution. The thinktank has also called for the National Audit Office to conduct an annual report on central government procurement transparency. This would include a \u201cleague table\u201d ranking of departments, with the bottom three departments compelled to make a statement to parliament.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s tough out there on the festival circuit for the newbie director. First-time film-makers frequently face an uphill battle getting noticed amid the noise and the circus of a film festival, and even more of a challenge securing distribution. Punters can be reluctant to take a risk on an unknown quantity in a festival schedule \u2013 on a director whose name isn\u2019t instantly recognisable and whose CV contains perhaps only a couple of short films. But in fact, first features are often the most exciting films in a programme. Rather than coasting into a screening slot on the strength of a director\u2019s past successes, first features are chosen on merit. To be selected, a debut has to deliver something accomplished and memorable \u2013 it has to be a forceful statement of intent.</p> <p>If the stars align, a successful festival launch can lead to a film that woos both critics and audiences, providing a career springboard for the director and actors while also doing good business at the box office. Recent examples include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/18/beast-southern-wild-review\" title=\"\">Benh Zeitlin\u2019s <em>Beasts </em><em>of </em><em>the Southern Wild</em></a>, which launched in Cannes 2012 and went on to earn four Oscar nominations; Jennifer Kent\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/26/the-babadook-review-mark-kermode-brilliant-chiller\" title=\"\"><em>The Babadook</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/get-out-review-jordan-peele-racism-america\" title=\"\">Jordan Peele\u2019s <em>Get Out</em></a>, first features that premiered to acclaim in Sundance 2014 and 2017 respectively and led to Peele winning an Oscar; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/30/lady-macbeth-review-florence-pugh-william-oldroyd\" title=\"\"><em>Lady Macbeth</em></a> (Toronto, 2016), which introduced the incomparable Florence Pugh to the movie world.</p> <p>It has been a particularly rich year for buzzy debuts breaking out at film festivals around the world. The trend started at Sundance, with Joe Talbot\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/27/the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-review-heartfelt-yet-twee-ode-to-the-city\" title=\"\"><em>The Last Black Man </em><em>in San Francisco</em></a> claiming both a directing prize and the special jury prize. At Cannes a few months later, two first features claimed slots in the main competition: Ladj Ly\u2019s propulsive Parisian crime drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/les-miserables-review-ladj-ly-debut-feature-paris-suburb-cop-procedural\" title=\"\"><em>Les Mis</em><em>\u00e9rables</em></a> won the jury prize and went on to earn France\u2019s submission in the best foreign language Oscar category. Meanwhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/atlantique-review-cannes-mati-diop-senegal-mystery\" title=\"\"><em>Atlantics</em></a>, a dreamy blend of supernatural drama and real-world commentary by actor and director Mati Diop, won the grand jury prize at Cannes and is the Senegalese Oscar submission.</p> <p>In the vast Toronto film festival programme, it\u2019s easy for the smaller films to get lost, but two British directors made their mark. Rose Glass\u2019s horror <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/saint-maud-morfydd-clark-jennifer-ehle-rose-glass-british-religious-horror-debut\" title=\"\"><em>Saint Maud</em></a> was a hit in the festival\u2019s popular Midnight Madness strand, while Nick Rowland\u2019s Ireland-set <a href=\"https://www.theupcoming.co.uk/2019/10/07/london-film-festival-2019-calm-with-horses-review/\" title=\"\"><em>Calm With Horses</em></a> established Rowland as a director to watch and lead Cosmo Jarvis (last seen in <em>Lady Macbeth</em>) as a star in the making. Toronto also premiered <em>Sound </em><em>of Metal</em>, the fiction feature debut from Darius Marder which stars Riz Ahmed as a deaf rock drummer.</p> <p>There\u2019s something particularly thrilling about discovering a stand-out first film at a festival \u2013 a sense that you are witnessing the beginning of a career that could go on to shape cinema for years to come. And on the strength of this year\u2019s crop, the future of film is in good hands.</p> <h2>Rose Glass: \u2018No other medium has the capacity to put you in someone else\u2019s head as much as film\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"334a2f720bb117883d65f8862cc7bfec394dfc31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334a2f720bb117883d65f8862cc7bfec394dfc31/130_0_2343_1406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morfydd Clark in Rose Glass\u2019s Saint Maud.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morfydd Clark in Rose Glass\u2019s Saint Maud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StudioCanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c60a8991717325e3d6aff5b335401cbe5fa6fa58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c60a8991717325e3d6aff5b335401cbe5fa6fa58/0_6_1593_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Glass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s pleased, it\u2019s like a shiver, or sometimes a pulsing,\u201d swoons private carer Maud of her relationship with God, in Rose Glass\u2019s tense, drily funny horror, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRmCM2pIoNc\" title=\"\"><em>Saint Maud</em></a>.

Last Sunday at the closing night of London film festival, where it was in the main competition, the jury president, director Wash Westmoreland, said: \u201cThis dazzling directorial debut marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in British cinema.\u201d A week before, when presenting Glass with the IWC Schaffhausen film-maker bursary \u2013 which promises \u00a350,000 of development funding to an early career film-maker \u2013 Danny Boyle described her as an \u201cextraordinary talent\u201d and said that the film\u2019s \u201cconfidence evokes the ecstasy of films like <em>Carrie</em>, <em>The Exorcist</em> and Jonathan Glazer\u2019s <em>Under </em><em>the Skin</em>\u201d.</p> <p>Born near Chelmsford, Essex, Glass studied film and video at the London College of Communication, later graduating from the National Film and Television School in 2014 with a master\u2019s in directing. The film-maker describes her younger self as an \u201cawkward, anxious teen\u201d who would \u201calways try and look up weird violent films and order them off the internet, video nasties, stuff like that\u201d. Darren Aronofsky\u2019s twisted psychological thriller <em>Pi</em> was an early obsession; a VHS of David Lynch\u2019s <em>Eraserhead</em> \u2013 a gift from her father \u2013 gave her a taste for on-screen viscera.</p> <p><em>Saint Maud</em> cleverly dances the knife-edge between horror and comedy, and Glass uses her jump scares judiciously. The director\u2019s eyes gleam as she recounts a rumour that at a recent screening an audience member was given such a fright that they \u201cwhacked their elbow so hard they broke it and had to have surgery\u201d.</p> <p>Alternately devoted and sneering, Maud is an unreliable and darkly hilarious narrator brilliantly brought to life by Welsh actor Morfydd Clark, who has appeared in Carol Morley\u2019s <em>The Falling</em> and Whit Stillman\u2019s <em>Love &amp; Friendship</em>, as well as Armando Ianucci\u2019s forthcoming <em>The Personal History of David Copperfield</em>. Glass says her early pitches imagined the character as \u201cTravis Bickle, if he was a young Catholic woman living in an English seaside town\u201d. She adds: \u201cYou never really know what could happen when someone feels alienated and isn\u2019t able to connect with humans around them. I\u2019m interested in the things that people turn to to try and make sense of the world around them. I don\u2019t think any other medium quite has the capacity to put you in someone else\u2019s head as much as film.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Describe your film-making in three words\u2026</strong><br>Strange, sensual and silly.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s a film that\u2019s really made an impact on you recently?</strong><br>Jennifer Reeder\u2019s <em>Knives and Skin</em> \u2013 it\u2019s like if John Waters directed a David Lynch movie.

Talbot is fifth-generation San Franciscan on his mother\u2019s side, Fails is also a native of the city. \u201cIn the grainy footage I\u2019d seen [of the city\u2019s past], and the music from San Francisco, like Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape and Janis Joplin, there was a real sense of love and optimism before things got dark,\u201d says Talbot, referring to the waves of gentrification and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\" title=\"\">Silicon Valley</a> money that have transformed their city into something \u201cincreasingly unfamiliar\u201d, wiping out black and lower-income neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Spurred on by their \u201ccollective depression\u201d about these changes, the pair decided to create a film. The result, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/27/the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-review-heartfelt-yet-twee-ode-to-the-city\" title=\"\"><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em></a>, is a gorgeous, sprawling love letter to a Victorian townhouse in the city\u2019s historic and rapidly transforming Fillmore district. Talbot writes and directs, while the story is based on the experiences of Fails, who also stars as a fictionalised version of himself trying, with friend Montgomery (Jonathan Majors), to reclaim a house that may or may not have been built by Fails\u2019s grandfather. Shot on location, Talbot says the film \u201caccidentally became the project of archiving the city, because a lot of those places don\u2019t exist any more\u201d. It was a huge hit at <a href=\"http://www.sfweekly.com/film/the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-wins-big-at-sundance/\" title=\"\">Sundance</a> in January, where it won two awards, including best director, and has since received rave reviews. In June, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/last-black-man-in-san-francisco-movie-review-785258/\" title=\"\"><em>Rolling</em></a><em> Stone</em> called it one of the best movies of the year.</p> <p>Talbot had an unconventional path into film-making. He attended the <a href=\"https://www.sfusd.edu/school/ruth-asawa-san-francisco-school-arts\" title=\"\">Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts</a>, but was, by his own admission, \u201ckind of a nuisance\u201d, and so dropped out. \u201cI grew up in a family of journalists and writers who loved movies, so when we weren\u2019t discussing politics at the dinner table, we were talking about movies and music,\u201d he says. His interest in film-making was inspired by an uncle he describes as \u201cthe family documentarian\u201d, whose camera he used to borrow.</p> <p><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> began life in 2014 as a \u201cfunky concept trailer\u201d that drummed up plenty of excitement but not enough money to shoot a feature. It was Talbot\u2019s second short, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/blog/post/staff-pick-premiere-american-paradise/\" title=\"\"><em>American Paradise</em></a>, that led to his breakthrough meeting with Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B production company, which then partnered with A24 films (whose hits include the Oscar-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/moonlight-review-masculinity-naomie-harris\" title=\"\"><em>Moonlight</em></a>) to give <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> the backing it needed.</p> <p>Talbot\u2019s debut takes a poetic, emotional approach to the problem of gentrification, which is perhaps why the film is resonating so widely. \u201cGentrification is often discussed as statistics, but it\u2019s smells, it\u2019s people that used to sit on their stoops, it\u2019s neighbourhood characters, it\u2019s buildings you loved that were part of your upbringing that are gutted,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted the movie to feel like it was out of Jimmie\u2019s heart.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Do you have a </strong><strong>role model?</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/oct/04/hal-ashby-the-landlord-classic\" title=\"\">Hal Ashby</a> is someone I look to.

The film, which was executive produced by Michael Fassbender, gives a vivid account of a fateful chapter in the life of a slow-witted heavy called Arm (a revelatory performance from Cosmo Jarvis). He must juggle his allegiance to a toxic criminal family that has embraced him as one of their own against his responsibilities to his ex-girlfriend and their autistic son.</p> <p>The film balances a small-town Ireland setting against big themes, crackling humour against aching pathos and casual violence against an empathetic core. Rowland\u2019s work with actors \u2013 Jarvis co-stars with Barry Keoghan and Niamh Algar, both excellent \u2013 is first rate; the level of film-making craft, particularly in the use of sound, is superb. It feels like the work of a director who was born to make movies.</p> <p>But in fact, Rowland\u2019s route into cinema was circuitous. Film school came after he had already spent several years as a professional rally driver racing in the Chinese Rally Championship and the British Rally Championship. \u201cI think I must be the only person ever to tell their mother \u2018I want to be a film director\u2019 and for her to be relieved because it was a less risky option than what I was already doing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Rowland followed his rally career with a stint as a tour guide in an aquarium (a low point was having to dress as Neptune for World Oceans Day) and lived with his mother, who had moved from the Midlands, where Rowland grew up, to Banff in Scotland. \u201cBecause I was away from my friends, I watched lots of movies. And that was the first time I engaged with film properly.\u201d At a career crossroads, Rowland idly took an online multiple choice quiz which suggested that he should be a librarian or a film-maker. He picked the latter and in 2015 graduated from the National Film and Television School.</p> <p>It was when he was developing another screenplay that he stumbled on a collection of writing by Colin Barrett, which contained the short story Calm With Horses. \u201cI am dyslexic. I find reading really hard,\u201d says Rowland. \u201cBut I read the whole collection in an afternoon, which is rare for me. And it was quite an instant reaction that this would make a good film. This contrast of a criminal world and a melancholy emotional heart. It felt really fresh.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why film?</strong><br>I think film is the best way to build empathy. I am very emotionally driven and go to the cinema to feel things. To feel what it is like to be someone else.</p> <p><strong>What film recently made an impact on you?</strong><br>I saw <em>Saint Maud</em> at Toronto and I thought it was astonishing. I went to film school with Rose [Glass, director]. You can see a line with her work back to her shorts. It\u2019s inspiring to see how her voice has developed.</p> <p><strong>What one thing can\u2019t you live without on set?</strong><br>Hand sanitiser.

The French-Senegalese director first turned her camera on migrants\u2019 dangerous boat journeys to Europe in her 2009 documentary short, <em>Atlantiques</em>. This time, however, she has turned her attention back towards the shore, to the women left behind; the story of Penelope, not Odysseus.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to tell the story from a feminine point of view,\u201d Diop says, when we meet ahead of the UK premiere at the London film festival, where it went on to win best first feature. \u201cIt was not a theoretical feminist approach \u2013 it was more personal.\u201d While visiting her family in Dakar, aged 25, after a 10-year absence, she was struck by the number of young people ready to risk their lives at sea. She knew she wanted to tell their story, but didn\u2019t want her film to follow them into the boat: \u201cIt\u2019s not my place, I don\u2019t have a right to be there.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the year, Diop made headlines as the first black female director to compete for the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes in the festival\u2019s 72-year history. Today, she politely but firmly moves the conversation on: \u201cIt was understandable that it took a lot of space at the time, but now that everybody knows, I think it shouldn\u2019t be a subject any more.\u201d The film won the Grand Prix, the festival\u2019s second most prestigious prize, then last month, at the Toronto film festival, Diop received the inaugural Mary Pickford award recognising outstanding female talent. There, the festival\u2019s artistic director, Cameron Bailey, said: \u201c<em>Atlantics</em> is a profound and unsettling work of art. We know this is just the start for such an original and authentic voice.\u201d Now the film has been selected as the Senegalese entry for next year\u2019s Academy Awards. The reception in Senegal, says Diop, has been \u201cvery, very positive \u2013 people recognised themselves\u201d.</p> <p>The Paris-based director, 37, has been making films since 2004. The niece of Senegalese film-maker Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, for her 2013 documentary, <em>A Thousand Suns</em>, Diop tracked down the lead actor from Mamb\u00e9ty\u2019s 1973 film <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/28412-touki-bouki\" title=\"\"><em>Touki Bouki</em></a>. Diop herself has worked as an actor, starring in films including <em>Simon Killer </em>(2012, opposite Brady Corbet) and Claire Denis\u2019s <em>35 Shots of Rum</em> (2008). Over the years, Denis has become something of a mentor; her influence permeates Diop\u2019s sensual, sensorial shots.</p> <p><em>Atlantics</em> is a moving take on the refugee crisis. It is a ghost love story focusing on 17-year-old Ada (Mama Bineta San\u00e9), promised to a wealthy man but in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traor\u00e9), who attempts a fateful journey to Spain; when the boat goes missing, supernatural events envelop the city. \u201cThe ghost dimension was inherent in the situation,\u201d says Diop. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a generation that has disappeared, and that necessarily haunts the living.\u201d The romance between Ada and Souleiman was just as important. \u201cI really wanted to tell a love story. I felt that through this story, it could really become universal, mythical.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What film recently made an impact on you?</strong><br>The films of Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho [whose western <em>Bacurau</em> was at Cannes this year].</p> <p><strong>Who would be your dream actor to work with?</strong><br>I don\u2019t know him yet.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s tough out there on the festival circuit for the newbie director. First-time film-makers frequently face an uphill battle getting noticed amid the noise and the circus of a film festival, and even more of a challenge securing distribution. Punters can be reluctant to take a risk on an unknown quantity in a festival schedule \u2013 on a director whose name isn\u2019t instantly recognisable and whose CV contains perhaps only a couple of short films. But in fact, first features are often the most exciting films in a programme. Rather than coasting into a screening slot on the strength of a director\u2019s past successes, first features are chosen on merit. To be selected, a debut has to deliver something accomplished and memorable \u2013 it has to be a forceful statement of intent. If the stars align, a successful festival launch can lead to a film that woos both critics and audiences, providing a career springboard for the director and actors while also doing good business at the box office. Recent examples include Benh Zeitlin\u2019s Beasts of the Southern Wild, which launched in Cannes 2012 and went on to earn four Oscar nominations; Jennifer Kent\u2019s The Babadook and Jordan Peele\u2019s Get Out, first features that premiered to acclaim in Sundance 2014 and 2017 respectively and led to Peele winning an Oscar; and Lady Macbeth (Toronto, 2016), which introduced the incomparable Florence Pugh to the movie world. It has been a particularly rich year for buzzy debuts breaking out at film festivals around the world. The trend started at Sundance, with Joe Talbot\u2019s The Last Black Man in San Francisco claiming both a directing prize and the special jury prize. At Cannes a few months later, two first features claimed slots in the main competition: Ladj Ly\u2019s propulsive Parisian crime drama Les Mis\u00e9rables won the jury prize and went on to earn France\u2019s submission in the best foreign language Oscar category. Meanwhile Atlantics, a dreamy blend of supernatural drama and real-world commentary by actor and director Mati Diop, won the grand jury prize at Cannes and is the Senegalese Oscar submission. In the vast Toronto film festival programme, it\u2019s easy for the smaller films to get lost, but two British directors made their mark. Rose Glass\u2019s horror Saint Maud was a hit in the festival\u2019s popular Midnight Madness strand, while Nick Rowland\u2019s Ireland-set Calm With Horses established Rowland as a director to watch and lead Cosmo Jarvis (last seen in Lady Macbeth) as a star in the making. Toronto also premiered Sound of Metal, the fiction feature debut from Darius Marder which stars Riz Ahmed as a deaf rock drummer. There\u2019s something particularly thrilling about discovering a stand-out first film at a festival \u2013 a sense that you are witnessing the beginning of a career that could go on to shape cinema for years to come. And on the strength of this year\u2019s crop, the future of film is in good hands. Rose Glass: \u2018No other medium has the capacity to put you in someone else\u2019s head as much as film\u2019 \u201cWhen he\u2019s pleased, it\u2019s like a shiver, or sometimes a pulsing,\u201d swoons private carer Maud of her relationship with God, in Rose Glass\u2019s tense, drily funny horror, Saint Maud. Maud assists a dying dancer played by Jennifer Ehle, all the while contemplating her own spiritual rebirth. \u201cAs soon as I started writing stories myself, they always tended to have slightly hallucinatory, sensual elements,\u201d says the movie\u2019s 30-year-old writer\u2011director. Glass\u2019s graduation film, Room 55, featured an uptight TV cook who experiences an epiphany while tied up in Japanese rope bondage. Since its world premiere at the Toronto film festival last month (where it was snapped up by trendy US distributor A24 Films), Saint Maud has bewitched audiences and industry luminaries alike. Last Sunday at the closing night of London film festival, where it was in the main competition, the jury president, director Wash Westmoreland, said: \u201cThis dazzling directorial debut marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in British cinema.\u201d A week before, when presenting Glass with the IWC Schaffhausen film-maker bursary \u2013 which promises \u00a350,000 of development funding to an early career film-maker \u2013 Danny Boyle described her as an \u201cextraordinary talent\u201d and said that the film\u2019s \u201cconfidence evokes the ecstasy of films like Carrie, The Exorcist and Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Under the Skin\u201d. Born near Chelmsford, Essex, Glass studied film and video at the London College of Communication, later graduating from the National Film and Television School in 2014 with a master\u2019s in directing. The film-maker describes her younger self as an \u201cawkward, anxious teen\u201d who would \u201calways try and look up weird violent films and order them off the internet, video nasties, stuff like that\u201d. Darren Aronofsky\u2019s twisted psychological thriller Pi was an early obsession; a VHS of David Lynch\u2019s Eraserhead \u2013 a gift from her father \u2013 gave her a taste for on-screen viscera. Saint Maud cleverly dances the knife-edge between horror and comedy, and Glass uses her jump scares judiciously. The director\u2019s eyes gleam as she recounts a rumour that at a recent screening an audience member was given such a fright that they \u201cwhacked their elbow so hard they broke it and had to have surgery\u201d. Alternately devoted and sneering, Maud is an unreliable and darkly hilarious narrator brilliantly brought to life by Welsh actor Morfydd Clark, who has appeared in Carol Morley\u2019s The Falling and Whit Stillman\u2019s Love &amp; Friendship, as well as Armando Ianucci\u2019s forthcoming The Personal History of David Copperfield. Glass says her early pitches imagined the character as \u201cTravis Bickle, if he was a young Catholic woman living in an English seaside town\u201d. She adds: \u201cYou never really know what could happen when someone feels alienated and isn\u2019t able to connect with humans around them. I\u2019m interested in the things that people turn to to try and make sense of the world around them. I don\u2019t think any other medium quite has the capacity to put you in someone else\u2019s head as much as film.\u201d Describe your film-making in three words\u2026 Strange, sensual and silly. What\u2019s a film that\u2019s really made an impact on you recently? Jennifer Reeder\u2019s Knives and Skin \u2013 it\u2019s like if John Waters directed a David Lynch movie. Trashy, smart and hilarious. What one thing can\u2019t you live without on set? Cigarettes. Saint Maud will be released next year Joe Talbot: \u2018The film became a project of archiving the city\u2026 a lot of these places don\u2019t exist any more\u2019 Joe Talbot and Jimmie Fails, friends since childhood, were raised on stories of what San Francisco was like for their respective families. Talbot is fifth-generation San Franciscan on his mother\u2019s side, Fails is also a native of the city. \u201cIn the grainy footage I\u2019d seen [of the city\u2019s past], and the music from San Francisco, like Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape and Janis Joplin, there was a real sense of love and optimism before things got dark,\u201d says Talbot, referring to the waves of gentrification and Silicon Valley money that have transformed their city into something \u201cincreasingly unfamiliar\u201d, wiping out black and lower-income neighbourhoods. Spurred on by their \u201ccollective depression\u201d about these changes, the pair decided to create a film. The result, The Last Black Man in San Francisco, is a gorgeous, sprawling love letter to a Victorian townhouse in the city\u2019s historic and rapidly transforming Fillmore district. Talbot writes and directs, while the story is based on the experiences of Fails, who also stars as a fictionalised version of himself trying, with friend Montgomery (Jonathan Majors), to reclaim a house that may or may not have been built by Fails\u2019s grandfather. Shot on location, Talbot says the film \u201caccidentally became the project of archiving the city, because a lot of those places don\u2019t exist any more\u201d. It was a huge hit at Sundance in January, where it won two awards, including best director, and has since received rave reviews. In June, Rolling Stone called it one of the best movies of the year. Talbot had an unconventional path into film-making. He attended the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts, but was, by his own admission, \u201ckind of a nuisance\u201d, and so dropped out. \u201cI grew up in a family of journalists and writers who loved movies, so when we weren\u2019t discussing politics at the dinner table, we were talking about movies and music,\u201d he says. His interest in film-making was inspired by an uncle he describes as \u201cthe family documentarian\u201d, whose camera he used to borrow. The Last Black Man in San Francisco began life in 2014 as a \u201cfunky concept trailer\u201d that drummed up plenty of excitement but not enough money to shoot a feature. It was Talbot\u2019s second short, American Paradise, that led to his breakthrough meeting with Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B production company, which then partnered with A24 films (whose hits include the Oscar-winning Moonlight) to give The Last Black Man in San Francisco the backing it needed. Talbot\u2019s debut takes a poetic, emotional approach to the problem of gentrification, which is perhaps why the film is resonating so widely. \u201cGentrification is often discussed as statistics, but it\u2019s smells, it\u2019s people that used to sit on their stoops, it\u2019s neighbourhood characters, it\u2019s buildings you loved that were part of your upbringing that are gutted,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted the movie to feel like it was out of Jimmie\u2019s heart.\u201d Do you have a role model? Hal Ashby is someone I look to. It\u2019s the empathy his films have for their characters \u2013 even the mean ones are treated with love. Who would be your dream actor to work with? Joaquin Phoenix. What one thing can\u2019t you live without on set? My Giants hat. SH The Last Black Man in San Francisco is released on Friday Nick Rowland: \u2018I must be the only person to tell their mother \u201cI want to direct films\u201d and for her to be relieved\u2019 Calm With Horses, the first feature from Nick Rowland, is a blistering debut. The film, which was executive produced by Michael Fassbender, gives a vivid account of a fateful chapter in the life of a slow-witted heavy called Arm (a revelatory performance from Cosmo Jarvis). He must juggle his allegiance to a toxic criminal family that has embraced him as one of their own against his responsibilities to his ex-girlfriend and their autistic son. The film balances a small-town Ireland setting against big themes, crackling humour against aching pathos and casual violence against an empathetic core. Rowland\u2019s work with actors \u2013 Jarvis co-stars with Barry Keoghan and Niamh Algar, both excellent \u2013 is first rate; the level of film-making craft, particularly in the use of sound, is superb. It feels like the work of a director who was born to make movies. But in fact, Rowland\u2019s route into cinema was circuitous. Film school came after he had already spent several years as a professional rally driver racing in the Chinese Rally Championship and the British Rally Championship. \u201cI think I must be the only person ever to tell their mother \u2018I want to be a film director\u2019 and for her to be relieved because it was a less risky option than what I was already doing,\u201d he says. Rowland followed his rally career with a stint as a tour guide in an aquarium (a low point was having to dress as Neptune for World Oceans Day) and lived with his mother, who had moved from the Midlands, where Rowland grew up, to Banff in Scotland. \u201cBecause I was away from my friends, I watched lots of movies. And that was the first time I engaged with film properly.\u201d At a career crossroads, Rowland idly took an online multiple choice quiz which suggested that he should be a librarian or a film-maker. He picked the latter and in 2015 graduated from the National Film and Television School. It was when he was developing another screenplay that he stumbled on a collection of writing by Colin Barrett, which contained the short story Calm With Horses. \u201cI am dyslexic. I find reading really hard,\u201d says Rowland. \u201cBut I read the whole collection in an afternoon, which is rare for me. And it was quite an instant reaction that this would make a good film. This contrast of a criminal world and a melancholy emotional heart. It felt really fresh.\u201d Why film? I think film is the best way to build empathy. I am very emotionally driven and go to the cinema to feel things. To feel what it is like to be someone else. What film recently made an impact on you? I saw Saint Maud at Toronto and I thought it was astonishing. I went to film school with Rose [Glass, director]. You can see a line with her work back to her shorts. It\u2019s inspiring to see how her voice has developed. What one thing can\u2019t you live without on set? Hand sanitiser. Lots of hand sanitiser. Calm With Horses is released next year Mati Diop: \u2018We\u2019re talking about a generation that has disappeared, and that necessarily haunts the living\u2019 In Mati Diop\u2019s eerie, atmospheric first feature, Atlantics, the ocean appears as an ominous presence, deceptively sparkling and calm. The French-Senegalese director first turned her camera on migrants\u2019 dangerous boat journeys to Europe in her 2009 documentary short, Atlantiques. This time, however, she has turned her attention back towards the shore, to the women left behind; the story of Penelope, not Odysseus. \u201cI wanted to tell the story from a feminine point of view,\u201d Diop says, when we meet ahead of the UK premiere at the London film festival, where it went on to win best first feature. \u201cIt was not a theoretical feminist approach \u2013 it was more personal.\u201d While visiting her family in Dakar, aged 25, after a 10-year absence, she was struck by the number of young people ready to risk their lives at sea. She knew she wanted to tell their story, but didn\u2019t want her film to follow them into the boat: \u201cIt\u2019s not my place, I don\u2019t have a right to be there.\u201d Earlier in the year, Diop made headlines as the first black female director to compete for the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes in the festival\u2019s 72-year history. Today, she politely but firmly moves the conversation on: \u201cIt was understandable that it took a lot of space at the time, but now that everybody knows, I think it shouldn\u2019t be a subject any more.\u201d The film won the Grand Prix, the festival\u2019s second most prestigious prize, then last month, at the Toronto film festival, Diop received the inaugural Mary Pickford award recognising outstanding female talent. There, the festival\u2019s artistic director, Cameron Bailey, said: \u201cAtlantics is a profound and unsettling work of art. We know this is just the start for such an original and authentic voice.\u201d Now the film has been selected as the Senegalese entry for next year\u2019s Academy Awards. The reception in Senegal, says Diop, has been \u201cvery, very positive \u2013 people recognised themselves\u201d. The Paris-based director, 37, has been making films since 2004. The niece of Senegalese film-maker Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, for her 2013 documentary, A Thousand Suns, Diop tracked down the lead actor from Mamb\u00e9ty\u2019s 1973 film Touki Bouki. Diop herself has worked as an actor, starring in films including Simon Killer (2012, opposite Brady Corbet) and Claire Denis\u2019s 35 Shots of Rum (2008). Over the years, Denis has become something of a mentor; her influence permeates Diop\u2019s sensual, sensorial shots. Atlantics is a moving take on the refugee crisis. It is a ghost love story focusing on 17-year-old Ada (Mama Bineta San\u00e9), promised to a wealthy man but in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traor\u00e9), who attempts a fateful journey to Spain; when the boat goes missing, supernatural events envelop the city. \u201cThe ghost dimension was inherent in the situation,\u201d says Diop. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a generation that has disappeared, and that necessarily haunts the living.\u201d The romance between Ada and Souleiman was just as important. \u201cI really wanted to tell a love story. I felt that through this story, it could really become universal, mythical.\u201d What film recently made an impact on you? The films of Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho [whose western Bacurau was at Cannes this year]. Who would be your dream actor to work with? I don\u2019t know him yet. My ideal actor to shoot is somebody I\u2019ve never seen before. Do you have a role model? Jordan Peele \u2013 he\u2019s a genius and has an incredible political vision. Atlantics will be in selected cinemas and on Netflix on 29 November",

      "body": "<p>On the afternoon of Wednesday 22 October 1969 Ozvaldo Zubeld\u00eda, coach of the Estudiantes side that would contest the second leg of the Intercontinental Cup against Milan that evening, crowbarred his squad into room 704 of the Hotel Nogaro in Buenos Aires to deliver his final address before they made the journey to the Bombonera for the game.</p> <p>Having lost 3-0 in Italy their task was daunting, but not quite impossible. Just before he went inside, he told reporters from the Argentinian magazine El Gr\u00e1fico what he planned to say. \u201cI think we have a 20% chance of success, but it will get much harder if we lose our heads,\u201d he said. \u201cThe important thing is to keep calm, play well, try to win the game even if we cannot recover the aggregate deficit, give a good account of ourselves and don\u2019t get anyone sent off. Play well, go out to win, but without losing control.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/27/forgotten-story-referee-disguise-newport-police-ambulanceman\">The forgotten story of \u2026 the referee smuggled from irate fans in disguise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cramped inside the hotel room his team listened intently. They mulled it over. And then they went to the stadium and played with such violence that three of them ended up in prison.</p> <p>Not that Zubeld\u00eda can plausibly claim innocence. This was a coach whose teams were always prone to violence and acts of premeditated dastardliness. The midfielder Juan Ram\u00f3n Ver\u00f3n (one of two fathers of future Chelsea players involved in the game, along with the Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini) said the Estudiantes side would be briefed on their rivals\u2019 \u201chabits, their characters, their weaknesses, and even their private lives\u201d so they were best able to goad them into getting themselves sent off. Like many particularly successful teams \u2013 think <em>tiki-taka</em>, or the <em>catenaccio</em> pioneered by Milan\u2019s Nereo Rocco \u2013 their tactics ended up with their own name: <em>El anti-f\u00fatbol</em>. With it they reached four successive Copa Libertadores finals, winning three, and beat Manchester United in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup (\u201cthe dirtiest team I\u2019ve played against,\u201d said Paddy Crerand).</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t win the Intercontinental Cup playing <em>anti-f\u00fatbol</em>,\u201d Zubeld\u00eda insisted. \u201cWhat happened with Estudientes after 1968 was that we got tired and the players ran out of stamina. There were so many tours and friendlies, the entire squad was injured. That\u2019s why the players, because they did not have the physical strength to play, turned to dirty tricks instead. What they called <em>anti-f\u00fatbol</em> was not a strategy, it was necessity.\u201d</p> <p>Well, perhaps. On that night in October 1969 the atmosphere inside the Bombonera was so febrile that Milan cut short their warm-up because of the level of abuse they were receiving. And then the game, and the violence, started. In the first half Pierino Prati, the Milan striker, was kicked to the ground by Alberto Jos\u00e9 Poletti, the Estudiantes goalkeeper \u2013 on the halfway line, while the home side took a corner \u2013 and then headbutted out of the game by Ramon Su\u00e1rez.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d77c0ca8d8c3713a31be872c50c6f34db24390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d77c0ca8d8c3713a31be872c50c6f34db24390/0_0_5526_3316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police speak to an Estudiantes player.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police speak to an Estudiantes player.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone Press/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shortly afterwards Rivera, who had been kicked while on the ground by Eduardo Manera, gave Milan a 4-0 aggregate lead, which served to wind up their opponents still further. Estudiantes came back to lead 2-1 on the night, before shortly after half-time Su\u00e1rez made another telling intervention. \u201cHaving insulted N\u00e9stor Combin horribly and covered him in spit, and while play continued far away, Su\u00e1rez savagely hit his opponent on the nose,\u201d wrote La Stampa. Combin crumpled to the turf, blood pouring from his face, and was loaded on to a stretcher. It turned out this was not to be the low point of his evening.</p> <p>After more savage fouling but no further scoring the game ended and the players returned to their dressing rooms, some throwing a few more punches along the way. Face swollen and balls of cotton wool stuffed up each nostril to stem the bleeding, Combin eventually emerged at 12.30am to board the team coach, but as he made his way across the car park he was surrounded by six unfamiliar people and bundled into an unmarked green car. A fan leapt upon the bonnet to stop it leaving, and was hauled off by police and beaten. Milan thought their night of controversy and confusion was coming to a close; in fact it had only just begun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9548193df6ec710b694c3cb20b898e89efede376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9548193df6ec710b694c3cb20b898e89efede376/0_0_2618_3779/693.jpg\" alt=\"Milan\u2019s Nestor Combin suffered facial injuries after being assaulted by an Estudiantes player.\" width=\"693\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milan\u2019s Nestor Combin suffered facial injuries after being assaulted by an Estudiantes player.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topham Picturepoint/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Combin had been born in Argentina, and in the local media was portrayed as a traitor in the buildup to the game, particularly as he had not done his national service. A magistrate in his home province of Santa Fe had accused him of draft-dodging in 1963, and there had been much speculation that he might be arrested and charged with desertion, a genuine enough concern that many other Argentina-born footballers of the era refused to return to their homeland. Combin, however, had served in the French army and under the terms of a reciprocal agreement between the two nations had no obligations to the land of his birth. This did not dissuade the Buenos Aires police from basically kidnapping him.</p> <p>In the early hours of Thursday morning Italian journalists toured the city\u2019s police stations in search of the lost player. At 2am he was finally located, but 45 minutes later he was bundled into another car and driven away again, this time to a military prison. At 3.30am Milan officials finally returned to their hotel, where one of them \u2013 who had been hit on the head by a baton-wielding policeman at the ground earlier in the evening \u2013 collapsed. At 4am Combin was officially charged with draft-dodging, and Milan officials set about assembling evidence to exculpate him \u2013 the player had taken the precaution of packing his draft book and a letter from the French consular general in Milan. At 10.30am a tired and groggy Combin was allowed to briefly talk to journalists (\u201cSu\u00e1rez kept yelling, \u2018I\u2019ll break your leg\u2019 and spitting in my face. I truly have no idea why he had it in for me\u201d). At noon, after the intervention of the Argentinian president, Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda, he was released and driven to the airport to join his teammates on the flight home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6b9fcea4562b3a9726c6e2b0e4d8a9537dc07fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b9fcea4562b3a9726c6e2b0e4d8a9537dc07fb/0_88_5535_3805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milan players help an injured teammate off the pitch at the Bombonera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milan players help an injured teammate off the pitch at the Bombonera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone Press/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ongan\u00eda had watched the game, which was televised around the world, and spoke later that day about a \u201clamentable spectacle which breached the most basic sporting ethics\u201d.

But it should not be practiced in football boots,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIn the matches Romania v Portugal and Yugoslavia v Belgium the kicking started at the navel and got higher and higher \u2026 Why play when it is no longer a football match, when the laws have been thrown into the rubbish bin and we have the law of the jungle instead?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16657efb05fceb0f917c4e318b15e8a123b2a20a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16657efb05fceb0f917c4e318b15e8a123b2a20a/0_185_3936_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milan players, including Combin, with a swollen face, display the trophy after returning from Argentina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milan players, including Combin, with a swollen face, display the trophy after returning from Argentina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topham Picturepoint/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, Argentina were particularly adept at this football/karate hybrid \u2013 and the worst was yet to come.

At arrows drawn are Bloomsbury\u2019s British Museum and the V&amp;A in South Kensington, which both claim to be the best place for the extraordinary 11th-century artwork.</p> <p>The former argues that if shown there it would \u201cbe seen by the widest and most international audience\u201d. The British Museum also has a small team working with Normandy on the best conditions for the delicate tapestry and the feasibility of getting it to London. Yet the V&amp;A says that, with its new Sainsbury gallery, it now has the space to display the 70 metre-long piece of history. And it has far more expertise in textiles than its rival. True.</p> <p>Splendid to see such fighting spirit between these two great museums. They\u2019re also at loggerheads over their shops after the V&amp;A\u2019s ebullient chairman, Nicholas Coleridge, bragged that his outlet was now outselling the other\u2019s. Not so. While the British Museum\u2019s merchandising takings went down last year and the V&amp;A\u2019s moved up, the Bloomsbury institution is still ahead.</p> <p>The British Museum may be a tad touchy because it\u2019s no longer the UK\u2019s prime attraction, after Tate Modern grabbed the lead in 2018. But the museum now tells me that in the financial year to April 2019 it has regained top spot, with 200,000 more visitors than Tate.

At arrows drawn are Bloomsbury\u2019s British Museum and the V&amp;A in South Kensington, which both claim to be the best place for the extraordinary 11th-century artwork. The former argues that if shown there it would \u201cbe seen by the widest and most international audience\u201d. The British Museum also has a small team working with Normandy on the best conditions for the delicate tapestry and the feasibility of getting it to London. Yet the V&amp;A says that, with its new Sainsbury gallery, it now has the space to display the 70 metre-long piece of history. And it has far more expertise in textiles than its rival. True. Splendid to see such fighting spirit between these two great museums. They\u2019re also at loggerheads over their shops after the V&amp;A\u2019s ebullient chairman, Nicholas Coleridge, bragged that his outlet was now outselling the other\u2019s. Not so. While the British Museum\u2019s merchandising takings went down last year and the V&amp;A\u2019s moved up, the Bloomsbury institution is still ahead. The British Museum may be a tad touchy because it\u2019s no longer the UK\u2019s prime attraction, after Tate Modern grabbed the lead in 2018. But the museum now tells me that in the financial year to April 2019 it has regained top spot, with 200,000 more visitors than Tate. Size really does matter behind the scenes at our cultural attractions. After the daft score draw at the Booker prize between Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo, up next comes what has been called the Booker of the north. The Portico prize for literature, named after the 200-year-old subscription library in Manchester, has been awarded every other year since 1985, for books and/or authors that embody \u201cthe spirit of the North\u201d, except for in 2017, when it lost its sponsor. It\u2019s back this year, thanks to a partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University, and will be awarded in January. Past winners include Anthony Burgess and former Booker shortlistee Sarah Hall. Judges this year \u2013 from actor Holliday Grainger of The Capture to standup poet Kate Fox \u2013 have chosen a delightfully eclectic longlist. I\u2019ve read just one of the 17 titles, a biography by Angela Steidele of Gentleman Jack, aka Anne Lister, whose life was portrayed in the BBC drama. I am most intrigued by Sensible Footwear: A Girl\u2019s Guide. A book on sturdy shoes to counter that harsh northern weather? No, it\u2019s a very personal story by Kate Charlesworth of LGBTQ history since the 1950s, and was recently reviewed by this paper as its graphic novel of the month. I\u2019m sure the BBC\u2019s chairman, David Clementi, has been listening even more attentively than usual to Radio 3 these past seven days. Its composer of the week has been the Italian-born Muzio Clementi, who just happens to be the great-great grandfather of the corporation\u2019s boss. Of course he was chosen entirely on merit and not by Radio 3 trying to butter up the chairman. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2019 to correct Sackler gallery to Sainsbury gallery.",

      "body": "<p>There has been much talk of late about Irish \u201cborder communities\u201d being threatened by a hard border. But not about border <em>unionist</em> communities, which by and large have been ignored by visiting camera teams and have a completely different narrative, while talk of a hard border has a less negative ring in their ears.</p> <p>The reason is simple and it is summed up by the common use of two terms by border unionists to describe the IRA campaign and the role that they see the Irish Republic to have played during the Troubles: \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and \u201csafe haven\u201d.</p> <p>Many border Protestants were driven from their homes to safer towns. Border security installations did not exist in 1969 \u2013 they were built to try to control the IRA\u2019s use of the border as a means to bring in men and explosives to Northern Ireland from the relative haven of the republic; to escape after attacks in the north; and as somewhere to plan operations and manufacture explosives and weapons. (In 1988, the British army believed 10 of the IRA\u2019s main active service units were based in the republic.)</p> <p>The Irish state used the British desire for security cooperation to gain the political concessions in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/30/national-archives-thatcher-vetoes-anglo-irish-agreement\" title=\"\">Anglo-Irish agreement</a> in 1985. Some in Leo Varadkar\u2019s government pursued a similar strategy by talking up dissident attacks near the border as a product of Brexit when they are nothing of the kind. They predated Brexit and even if Brexit does not happen, they will continue.</p> <p>All this provides context for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/dup-boris-johnson-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s rejection</a> of the revised withdrawal agreement, perplexing some observers of unionist politics who point out it had already accepted regulatory alignment with the EU. (Which held out the prospect of divergence over time from the rest of the UK.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bae6364ecdbfb9deae236408e126a7edaa9e8815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bae6364ecdbfb9deae236408e126a7edaa9e8815/78_36_2367_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Democratic Unionist party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, right, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The clue to the DUP\u2019s problems with Brexit lies in the party\u2019s class politics. Although its critics had portrayed it as a proponent of a hard Brexit, this missed divisions and nuances \u2013 the DUP\u2019s initial support for Brexit lacked much of the ideological fervour of the members of the European Research Group. As it supplanted the Ulster Unionist party during the peace process, its earlier, largely working-class appeal was widened to include the Protestant middle and business class. It was well aware of the opposition to Brexit of much of this business community. However, it was also acutely conscious that many working-class loyalists, who had not rated membership of the EU as high on their list of priorities, reacted to the referendum by integrating Brexit into a vision of unionist retreat and loss during the peace process.</p> <p>Despite the collapse of the republican movement\u2019s revolutionary project and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s acceptance of the principle of consent, a substantial section of the loyalist working class believes that republicans have turned a military defeat into a political and ideological victory. This they have done through a cultural war on issues such as flags and emblems, Orange parades and, most importantly, the \u201cinquiry culture\u201d into the legacy of the Troubles and what is seen as the rewriting of history. This is now manifest in the profoundly different narratives on Brexit and the border.</p> <p>The focus of the Irish government and the EU on the danger to the peace process of a hard border produced an upsurge of media and publishing interest in the Irish border past and present. As the author of a book on the role played by the border during the Troubles, I followed this coverage with interest but also with some concern at its onesidedness.</p> <p>Typical was a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-47973814\" title=\"\">visit last April to the border</a> near Derry by a delegation of senior US politicians led by the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/hard-border-a-roadblock-to-us-uk-trade-deal-congressman-says-1.3824797\" title=\"\">Richard Neal</a>, one of the congressmen, claimed that the last time he was on the border, 30 years earlier, his bus was stopped and searched by heavily armed British soldiers. Brexit, he implied, meant a clear and present danger to the peace process and the danger of a return of the \u201cbad old days\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1227d3e014a3ac00e1927724f67a2c3b82dcd323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1227d3e014a3ac00e1927724f67a2c3b82dcd323/0_201_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why the soldiers were there was not explained, but implicit was acceptance of a longstanding Irish nationalist narrative about the border as a mutilation of the island, imposed and maintained by imperial might. A similar point was made by Varadkar when last year <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/brexit/varadkar-shows-eu27-dinner-guests-border-bomb-horror-picture-brexit-deadlock-over-ireland-backstop-37433917.html\" title=\"\">he circulated</a> among EU leaders a copy of an Irish newspaper featuring the story of an IRA bombing of the Newry customs office in 1972 in which nine people were killed. Any customs controls on the island of Ireland risked the return of such devastating incidents.</p> <p>Nevertheless, in the pursuit of Brexit before the end of the month, and under pressure from the Benn act, Boris Johnson has conceded the core of the Irish argument and left the DUP with little choice but rejection. While Irish nationalists saw Brexit as a fundamental violation of the Good Friday agreement, now the large majority of working-class unionists who voted for Brexit will not be happy with a deal that hives off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. In this they have the support of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/05/european-union-crucial-to-securing-peace-in-ireland-this-plan-puts-it-in-peril\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a>, who opposes the deal because it puts the union at risk.</p> <p>Days before the deal was announced, it was reported that loyalist paramilitary organisations were predicting protests and campaigns of civil disobedience if the British government attempted to align Northern Ireland and the republic in any customs arrangement.</p> <p>Some of this may well turn out to be bluster, but the message from those in a position to know about grassroots loyalism is that it is very difficult to find anyone who supports this deal and that tensions are high. The DUP\u2019s rejection and promise of a war of attrition in the House of Commons is in part at least designed to keep a lid on this anger.</p> <p>\u2022 Henry Patterson is emeritus professor of politics at Ulster University and the author of <em>Ireland\u2019s Violent Frontier</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "There has been much talk of late about Irish \u201cborder communities\u201d being threatened by a hard border. But not about border unionist communities, which by and large have been ignored by visiting camera teams and have a completely different narrative, while talk of a hard border has a less negative ring in their ears. The reason is simple and it is summed up by the common use of two terms by border unionists to describe the IRA campaign and the role that they see the Irish Republic to have played during the Troubles: \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and \u201csafe haven\u201d. Many border Protestants were driven from their homes to safer towns. Border security installations did not exist in 1969 \u2013 they were built to try to control the IRA\u2019s use of the border as a means to bring in men and explosives to Northern Ireland from the relative haven of the republic; to escape after attacks in the north; and as somewhere to plan operations and manufacture explosives and weapons. (In 1988, the British army believed 10 of the IRA\u2019s main active service units were based in the republic.) The Irish state used the British desire for security cooperation to gain the political concessions in the Anglo-Irish agreement in 1985. Some in Leo Varadkar\u2019s government pursued a similar strategy by talking up dissident attacks near the border as a product of Brexit when they are nothing of the kind. They predated Brexit and even if Brexit does not happen, they will continue. All this provides context for the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s rejection of the revised withdrawal agreement, perplexing some observers of unionist politics who point out it had already accepted regulatory alignment with the EU. (Which held out the prospect of divergence over time from the rest of the UK.) The clue to the DUP\u2019s problems with Brexit lies in the party\u2019s class politics. Although its critics had portrayed it as a proponent of a hard Brexit, this missed divisions and nuances \u2013 the DUP\u2019s initial support for Brexit lacked much of the ideological fervour of the members of the European Research Group. As it supplanted the Ulster Unionist party during the peace process, its earlier, largely working-class appeal was widened to include the Protestant middle and business class. It was well aware of the opposition to Brexit of much of this business community. However, it was also acutely conscious that many working-class loyalists, who had not rated membership of the EU as high on their list of priorities, reacted to the referendum by integrating Brexit into a vision of unionist retreat and loss during the peace process. Despite the collapse of the republican movement\u2019s revolutionary project and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s acceptance of the principle of consent, a substantial section of the loyalist working class believes that republicans have turned a military defeat into a political and ideological victory. This they have done through a cultural war on issues such as flags and emblems, Orange parades and, most importantly, the \u201cinquiry culture\u201d into the legacy of the Troubles and what is seen as the rewriting of history. This is now manifest in the profoundly different narratives on Brexit and the border. The focus of the Irish government and the EU on the danger to the peace process of a hard border produced an upsurge of media and publishing interest in the Irish border past and present. As the author of a book on the role played by the border during the Troubles, I followed this coverage with interest but also with some concern at its onesidedness. Typical was a visit last April to the border near Derry by a delegation of senior US politicians led by the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Richard Neal, one of the congressmen, claimed that the last time he was on the border, 30 years earlier, his bus was stopped and searched by heavily armed British soldiers. Brexit, he implied, meant a clear and present danger to the peace process and the danger of a return of the \u201cbad old days\u201d. Why the soldiers were there was not explained, but implicit was acceptance of a longstanding Irish nationalist narrative about the border as a mutilation of the island, imposed and maintained by imperial might. A similar point was made by Varadkar when last year he circulated among EU leaders a copy of an Irish newspaper featuring the story of an IRA bombing of the Newry customs office in 1972 in which nine people were killed. Any customs controls on the island of Ireland risked the return of such devastating incidents. Nevertheless, in the pursuit of Brexit before the end of the month, and under pressure from the Benn act, Boris Johnson has conceded the core of the Irish argument and left the DUP with little choice but rejection. While Irish nationalists saw Brexit as a fundamental violation of the Good Friday agreement, now the large majority of working-class unionists who voted for Brexit will not be happy with a deal that hives off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. In this they have the support of Tony Blair, who opposes the deal because it puts the union at risk. Days before the deal was announced, it was reported that loyalist paramilitary organisations were predicting protests and campaigns of civil disobedience if the British government attempted to align Northern Ireland and the republic in any customs arrangement. Some of this may well turn out to be bluster, but the message from those in a position to know about grassroots loyalism is that it is very difficult to find anyone who supports this deal and that tensions are high. The DUP\u2019s rejection and promise of a war of attrition in the House of Commons is in part at least designed to keep a lid on this anger. \u2022 Henry Patterson is emeritus professor of politics at Ulster University and the author of Ireland\u2019s Violent Frontier",

      "body": "<p>It was early evening when Victoria Morley arrived at her \u20ac6,000 holiday villa on the Maltese island of Gozo. The five-bedroom farmhouse had been described on TripAdvisor as a \u201cunique experience of luxury accommodation\u201d and Morley had spent her savings on a fortnight\u2019s stay to reunite her family after the recent death of her husband. The luxury turned out to be restricted to the seductive photos on the TripAdvisor listing. \u201cIt was dirty, some of the furniture was broken, toilets were blocked, cable TV had been advertised but wasn\u2019t subscribed to, the whirlpool bath didn\u2019t work and the pool had lots of tiles missing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole place was rundown and, more worryingly, it failed to meet European safety standards, with no fire extinguishers or smoke detectors.\u201d</p> <p>Morley was unable to find a phone number for TripAdvisor on its website and, since it was getting late, the family went to bed. She emailed the company at 6am the following morning to report her concerns and was called by a representative who assured her that she would be covered by the company\u2019s payment protection scheme.</p> <p>The ensuing holiday was interrupted by plumbers and builders called to repair leaks and other defects, and by regular emails to TripAdvisor as new evidence of the villa\u2019s condition emerged. At the end of their stay, the company announced that they would not be covered after all, because Morley should have informed them of the problems on arrival, then vacated the property. \u201cWe weren\u2019t told this at the time and we would in any case have been unable to find another property at such short notice,\u201d she says. \u201cWith my two autistic sons and an 85-year-old mother in our party it wasn\u2019t viable to walk out with all our luggage in the evening, after a long day of travelling and with nowhere to go.\u201d</p> <p>Morley tried to claim via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/01/ebay-paypal-sell-buyer-protection\" title=\"\">PayPal\u2019s buyer protection scheme</a>, but was told that since the accommodation had been \u201cdelivered\u201d, it could not help. She could not issue a claim via her credit card issuer because transactions through third-party payment systems, such as PayPal, are not covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.

      "bodyText": "It was early evening when Victoria Morley arrived at her \u20ac6,000 holiday villa on the Maltese island of Gozo. The five-bedroom farmhouse had been described on TripAdvisor as a \u201cunique experience of luxury accommodation\u201d and Morley had spent her savings on a fortnight\u2019s stay to reunite her family after the recent death of her husband. The luxury turned out to be restricted to the seductive photos on the TripAdvisor listing. \u201cIt was dirty, some of the furniture was broken, toilets were blocked, cable TV had been advertised but wasn\u2019t subscribed to, the whirlpool bath didn\u2019t work and the pool had lots of tiles missing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole place was rundown and, more worryingly, it failed to meet European safety standards, with no fire extinguishers or smoke detectors.\u201d Morley was unable to find a phone number for TripAdvisor on its website and, since it was getting late, the family went to bed. She emailed the company at 6am the following morning to report her concerns and was called by a representative who assured her that she would be covered by the company\u2019s payment protection scheme. The ensuing holiday was interrupted by plumbers and builders called to repair leaks and other defects, and by regular emails to TripAdvisor as new evidence of the villa\u2019s condition emerged. At the end of their stay, the company announced that they would not be covered after all, because Morley should have informed them of the problems on arrival, then vacated the property. \u201cWe weren\u2019t told this at the time and we would in any case have been unable to find another property at such short notice,\u201d she says. \u201cWith my two autistic sons and an 85-year-old mother in our party it wasn\u2019t viable to walk out with all our luggage in the evening, after a long day of travelling and with nowhere to go.\u201d Morley tried to claim via PayPal\u2019s buyer protection scheme, but was told that since the accommodation had been \u201cdelivered\u201d, it could not help. She could not issue a claim via her credit card issuer because transactions through third-party payment systems, such as PayPal, are not covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. The only agency to act on her complaint was the Maltese tourist board, which barred the owner from renting the property again until it complied with safety standards. However, the listing remains on TripAdvisor\u2019s website. Morley\u2019s experience was a painful lesson in the lack of protection available to travellers who book through comparison platforms such as TripAdvisor, Skyscanner or TravelSupermarket. And it serves as a warning to those who, in the wake of the collapse of Thomas Cook and other travel companies, decide to organise a holiday themselves.

      "bodyText": "The ABC has set aside $23m in compensation for 2,500 casual staff it may have underpaid, according to its latest annual report on Wednesday. A union report released on Sunday found this was the result of a cultural attitude that treated casuals as \u201csecond-class workers\u201d who could be exploited to save money amid shrinking budgets. The $23m repayment bill comes \u201cat a time that the ABC can ill-afford it\u201d, the Community and Public Sector Union said, following the organisation\u2019s $84m budget cut in 2018. In January, the ABC admitted it may have underpaid 2,500 staff over six years due to the practice of putting casuals on \u201cloaded rates\u201d, which are flat rates without penalty rates for late nights, weekends or public holidays. One Brisbane employee was underpaid by $19,000 over three years, as revealed in December after an investigation by the CPSU. On Wednesday, the ABC\u2019s annual report for 2018-19 included a budget item of $22,984,000 for \u201cestimated historical salary and wages and superannuation entitlements owed to certain casual employees\u201d. An ABC spokesman said the organisation had \u201cworked proactively\u201d to fix the payments, and affected staff would soon be contacted for backpay. He said the $23m had \u201cbeen taken into account in our budget planning for the current financial year\u201d. On Sunday, the CPSU released its own report, interviewing 162 current and former employees, and examining the records of 63. It found some ABC managers would roster flat-rate casual staff \u201calmost exclusively\u201d for weekends and holidays to save money. \u201cThe CPSU believes that unrelenting budget pressures and subpar employment advice have given rise to a culture in some parts of the organisation where it is okay to treat casual employees as second-class workers,\u201d it said. \u201cOur investigations show that some ABC managers fully exploited casual employees on loaded rates, rostering them almost exclusively for weekend and public holiday work because it was cheaper than using employees who were paid penalties. \u201cThe managerial view that casual workers are a cheaper source of labour that can be used to improve ABC budget bottom lines is deeply embedded in some pockets of the organisation.\u201d The ABC\u2019s budget was cut by $84m in 2018, adding to up to $254m in cuts since 2014. Under the \u201cloaded rates\u201d arrangement, casual staff members received a higher base rate of pay, in lieu of receiving penalty rates. Under Australian labour law, this is legal as long as the employee ends up \u201cbetter off overall\u201d than what they would have received under the award.

One of the women, Sarah, told the <em>Observer</em> that the \u201cjoke\u201d approach to the allegations ensured that the force looked after PC Clarke Joslyn instead of his victims.</p> <p>Sarah started dating Joslyn after another recruit, Jodie, reported him for controlling behaviour and stalking; Gwent police had not acted on her complaints. Unaware of his past, Sarah reported several assaults \u2013 including an allegation that he pinned her to the wall while holding a knife \u2013 but Joslyn was never arrested.</p> <p>\u201cThey chose to protect the reputation of the force.

Despite the conclusion, on balance, that many of the allegations were proven, Joslyn, who resigned before his misconduct hearing, remained \u201chighly thought of\u201d in the force. Sarah said: \u201cIt\u2019s literally a boys\u2019 club, I can\u2019t describe it any other way. He made threats saying, \u2018If you tell them what I\u2019m like you\u2019ll end up losing your job.\u2019 He was right in the end.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet Wistrich, founding director of Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, called the case a \u201cgood example of a pervasive sexist culture within the police, which favours male loyalty over accountability for those who abuse\u201d.</p> <p>Wistrich added: \u201cIt is sadly not an isolated case, but illustrates systemic faults that require change.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the cases the centre had gathered, said Ofer, involved female police officers who had suffered victimisation and whose careers had been severely affected.</p> <p>Ofer said: \u201cWe will be proposing that such cases should be dealt with outside the police force concerned.\u201d. Women who have come forward include one whose husband was a serving officer and whose force handed him a copy of her statement against him, then mysteriously lost it. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I\u2019m a police officer, no one\u2019s going to believe you,\u2019\u201d the woman, whose husband remains a serving officer, <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2019-09-13/no-convictions-in-police-scotlands-officer-domestic-abuse-investigations\" title=\"\">told TBIJ.</a></p> <p>In another case, a woman said that the force where her partner worked was \u201ccompletely uninterested\u201d in her rape allegations against him. Her partner\u2019s force interviewed and bailed him after she alleged that he had raped her, but soon closed its criminal investigation. The case was transferred to a second force for an internal misconduct investigation, where it was discovered that the seals had never been broken on the evidence provided by the alleged victim.</p> <p>Another complaint is the subject of a wide-reaching inquiry into an alleged \u201c<a href=\"https://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/probe-into-claims-of-sexist-bullying-by-forres-police-boys-club-183984/\" title=\"\">boys\u2019 club</a>\u201d of sexist officers in north-east Scotland.

A statement said: \u201cIt is right that anyone who does not adhere to these standards is held accountable and the appropriate action is taken. In terms of the specifics outlined, many of these matters are now subject to further legal proceedings and it would be inappropriate to comment further.\u201d</p>",

Unaware of his past, Sarah reported several assaults \u2013 including an allegation that he pinned her to the wall while holding a knife \u2013 but Joslyn was never arrested. \u201cThey chose to protect the reputation of the force. I trusted the police force to protect me and instead I have lost all trust in them,\u201d she said. Sarah and Jodie, not their real names, are raising funds for a legal challenge against Gwent police over their \u201cprotection of a domestic violence perpetrator in their ranks\u201d. Following a police misconduct hearing into the officer, a 29-page report listed allegations of violence and control against women for which he was never charged or arrested. Despite the conclusion, on balance, that many of the allegations were proven, Joslyn, who resigned before his misconduct hearing, remained \u201chighly thought of\u201d in the force. Sarah said: \u201cIt\u2019s literally a boys\u2019 club, I can\u2019t describe it any other way. He made threats saying, \u2018If you tell them what I\u2019m like you\u2019ll end up losing your job.\u2019 He was right in the end.\u201d Harriet Wistrich, founding director of Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, called the case a \u201cgood example of a pervasive sexist culture within the police, which favours male loyalty over accountability for those who abuse\u201d. Wistrich added: \u201cIt is sadly not an isolated case, but illustrates systemic faults that require change.\u201d Many of the cases the centre had gathered, said Ofer, involved female police officers who had suffered victimisation and whose careers had been severely affected. Ofer said: \u201cWe will be proposing that such cases should be dealt with outside the police force concerned.\u201d. Women who have come forward include one whose husband was a serving officer and whose force handed him a copy of her statement against him, then mysteriously lost it. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I\u2019m a police officer, no one\u2019s going to believe you,\u2019\u201d the woman, whose husband remains a serving officer, told TBIJ. In another case, a woman said that the force where her partner worked was \u201ccompletely uninterested\u201d in her rape allegations against him. Her partner\u2019s force interviewed and bailed him after she alleged that he had raped her, but soon closed its criminal investigation. The case was transferred to a second force for an internal misconduct investigation, where it was discovered that the seals had never been broken on the evidence provided by the alleged victim. Another complaint is the subject of a wide-reaching inquiry into an alleged \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d of sexist officers in north-east Scotland. Male officers allegedly began bullying a female colleague after she reported her ex-partner, an officer in the the Moray command area, for domestic violence. Among the allegations are claims that male officers drove her to a forest at night and left her stranded \u201cto teach her a lesson\u201d. Gwent Police said Joslyn faced a misconduct hearing last year after a \u201cthorough and robust enquiry\u201d by its professional standards department. A statement said: \u201cIt is right that anyone who does not adhere to these standards is held accountable and the appropriate action is taken. In terms of the specifics outlined, many of these matters are now subject to further legal proceedings and it would be inappropriate to comment further.\u201d",

Maybe it\u2019s not all doom and gloom! Someone should tell Greta Thunberg.</p> <p>Again, it\u2019s probably a credit to the movement\u2019s focus that such alleged inconsistency appears to have inflicted only minor reputational damage and may even have diverted media attention, quite usefully, from more substantial questions. Such as: why do so many XR occupations look like an audience in search of the National Theatre? And why would an XR campaigner think it persuasive <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XRebellionUK/status/1184890614401458176\" title=\"\">to tweet:</a> \u201cWe are engineers. We are lawyers. We are doctors. We are everyone\u201d? Maybe they run a prep school. As George Monbiot wrote last week, before going off to get himself arrested: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/16/i-aim-to-get-arrested-climate-protesters\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class</a>.\u201d But perhaps that\u2019s in the nature of this form of direct action? If online activism as argued by Helen Margetts et al in <em>Political Turbulence</em> \u201cincreases the access of the poor to political action and reduces the relative advantage of the rich\u201d, then XR\u2019s focus on extended physical occupations appears to do the opposite.</p> <p>It could be that its main ambition, to force change through disruption \u2013 as opposed to by petitions, by cost-free micro-interventions \u2013 is indeed at odds with social inclusiveness. Ayesha Hazarika said, on Radio 4\u2019s <em>The News Quiz</em>: \u201cIt is literally all white people. And it\u2019s all like white schoolkids because no Asian schoolkid would be allowed to miss school.\u201d The movement\u2019s commitment to multiple arrests will deter, or keep at the margins, individuals for whom arrest or being in trouble involves real fear or jeopardy.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s exclusionary, unavoidable or even irrelevant, given what\u2019s at stake, this is not a great look. So at least while XR\u2019s critics are ridiculing luvvies they aren\u2019t dwelling on diversity \u2013 or the lack of it; the movement\u2019s apparent remoteness from people who might want to paint their faces white, dress up in red and parade along blocked roads making artistic gestures at police officers, but have to get to work instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9425548146ff8ec0d15dca2bacfa5bd719b8ebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9425548146ff8ec0d15dca2bacfa5bd719b8ebe/790_1117_5341_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extinction Rebellion protesters carry a pink  inflatable octopus down Whitehall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Social media has communicated its more edifying spectacles \u2013 the pink octopus, the cute boat, the dignified octogenarian arrestees \u2013 to the world.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that changed, of course, when a sub-group of rebels, ignoring the majority view that this was a bad idea, stopped a train at Canning Town in rush hour. While nobody could deny their bravery, since even a non-rucksack-remover in these rammed conditions would be widely regarded as asking for it, the resulting scene, showing the climate protesters looking, literally de haut en bas, upon the struggling commuters below, might as well have been directed by <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/moment-middle-class-eco-warrior-storms-off-sky-news-after-savaging-from-adam-boulton-a4120211.html\" title=\"\">Adam Boulton</a>, based on an original preconception by Piers Morgan. Although one man\u2019s shout, at an elevated rebel \u2013 \u201cI need to get to work! I have to feed my kids!\u201d \u2013 would probably have been cut, being too close to something Richard Littlejohn might make up.</p> <p>The same social media that has, thanks to XR\u2019s volunteer amplifiers, communicated its more edifying spectacles \u2013 the pink octopus, the cute boat, the dignified octogenarian arrestees \u2013 to the world, then ensured maximum damage, from this ugly, privilege v workers narrative, in the shortest time. As they came in, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/london-tube-protest-divides-extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">reactions from different parts</a> of XR\u2019s membership, largely disapproving or furious, though also defensive, occasionally patronising, were what you\u2019d expect from a decentralised movement that repudiates hierarchical organisation in favour of bottom-up \u201caffinity groups\u201d, disrupting on their own initiative. One spokesman, Rupert Read, said he was \u201creally sorry\u201d. Another, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50079716\" title=\"\">Howard Rees</a>, said: \u201cWas it the right thing to do? I am not sure.\u201d One of the movement\u2019s co-founders, Clare Farrell, said <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-17/extinction-rebellion-protesters-climb-on-board-tube-trains-in-east-london/\" title=\"\">it was justified</a>: \u201cThe public, I don\u2019t think, realise quite how serious this situation is.\u201d</p> <p>If not, you could argue, after multiple major protests, and any number of arrests, that this is a good moment for a strategic review. To build on its achievements and extract change, XR must find a way, as Occupy and other mobilisations have not, of sustaining participation, whether mass or niche. That seems less, not more, likely to happen if some of its affinity groups appear, and not only in Canning Town, to regard fellow citizens as incidental to their higher purpose. Having said that, I\u2019ve never had the chance to be educated when already late for work, by <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/extinction-rebellion-shadwell-arrest-charge-3441662\" title=\"\">a retired vicar</a>, stuck to a tube door.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Considering its rapid expansion, formal commitment to causing chaos and decentralised approach to mobilising, Extinction Rebellion has been, certainly until last week\u2019s underground setback, a triumph of non-violent direct action. Polls have suggested impressive levels of support from non-protesters. As for the rebels, name-calling, including by the prime minister, dredging up a 90s term from his insult back-catalogue, only underlined their organisational flair. These same \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d have persuaded a previous parliament to declare a climate emergency, changed the national conversation and initiated policy change. Bad publicity has been restricted, on the whole, to a misfiring fake-blood hose, and \u2013 although systemic rather than individual change is XR\u2019s purpose \u2013 the scant evidence that its A-list supporters are addressing their own carbon footprints. That celebrated social disruptor, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who invited him? \u2013 was happy to confirm, for instance, shortly after exhibiting himself at an XR occupation, his commitment to frequent long-haul flying. It\u2019s OK, apparently, if the flier is going to make \u201csome speech about the environmental problems or write about the animals\u201d. If you would like to support Stanley in this vital work, it may not be too late to join him, and fellow Telegraph readers, on a 13-night \u201cTreasures of India\u201d holiday: \u201cStanley will be with you for the duration of this tour.\u201d Another sign that XR\u2019s influencer collection could be more discerning was the involvement of Benedict Cumberbatch, the actor having evidently reconciled his anxiety about the climate emergency with his optimism for a new MG SUV. Expected in both petrol and diesel versions, the Hector, according to Cumberbatch in his MG ad, \u201cmay well be a classic of the future\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s not all doom and gloom! Someone should tell Greta Thunberg. Again, it\u2019s probably a credit to the movement\u2019s focus that such alleged inconsistency appears to have inflicted only minor reputational damage and may even have diverted media attention, quite usefully, from more substantial questions. Such as: why do so many XR occupations look like an audience in search of the National Theatre? And why would an XR campaigner think it persuasive to tweet: \u201cWe are engineers. We are lawyers. We are doctors. We are everyone\u201d? Maybe they run a prep school. As George Monbiot wrote last week, before going off to get himself arrested: \u201cExtinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class.\u201d But perhaps that\u2019s in the nature of this form of direct action? If online activism as argued by Helen Margetts et al in Political Turbulence \u201cincreases the access of the poor to political action and reduces the relative advantage of the rich\u201d, then XR\u2019s focus on extended physical occupations appears to do the opposite. It could be that its main ambition, to force change through disruption \u2013 as opposed to by petitions, by cost-free micro-interventions \u2013 is indeed at odds with social inclusiveness. Ayesha Hazarika said, on Radio 4\u2019s The News Quiz: \u201cIt is literally all white people. And it\u2019s all like white schoolkids because no Asian schoolkid would be allowed to miss school.\u201d The movement\u2019s commitment to multiple arrests will deter, or keep at the margins, individuals for whom arrest or being in trouble involves real fear or jeopardy. Whether it\u2019s exclusionary, unavoidable or even irrelevant, given what\u2019s at stake, this is not a great look. So at least while XR\u2019s critics are ridiculing luvvies they aren\u2019t dwelling on diversity \u2013 or the lack of it; the movement\u2019s apparent remoteness from people who might want to paint their faces white, dress up in red and parade along blocked roads making artistic gestures at police officers, but have to get to work instead. But that changed, of course, when a sub-group of rebels, ignoring the majority view that this was a bad idea, stopped a train at Canning Town in rush hour. While nobody could deny their bravery, since even a non-rucksack-remover in these rammed conditions would be widely regarded as asking for it, the resulting scene, showing the climate protesters looking, literally de haut en bas, upon the struggling commuters below, might as well have been directed by Adam Boulton, based on an original preconception by Piers Morgan. Although one man\u2019s shout, at an elevated rebel \u2013 \u201cI need to get to work! I have to feed my kids!\u201d \u2013 would probably have been cut, being too close to something Richard Littlejohn might make up. The same social media that has, thanks to XR\u2019s volunteer amplifiers, communicated its more edifying spectacles \u2013 the pink octopus, the cute boat, the dignified octogenarian arrestees \u2013 to the world, then ensured maximum damage, from this ugly, privilege v workers narrative, in the shortest time. As they came in, reactions from different parts of XR\u2019s membership, largely disapproving or furious, though also defensive, occasionally patronising, were what you\u2019d expect from a decentralised movement that repudiates hierarchical organisation in favour of bottom-up \u201caffinity groups\u201d, disrupting on their own initiative. One spokesman, Rupert Read, said he was \u201creally sorry\u201d. Another, Howard Rees, said: \u201cWas it the right thing to do? I am not sure.\u201d One of the movement\u2019s co-founders, Clare Farrell, said it was justified: \u201cThe public, I don\u2019t think, realise quite how serious this situation is.\u201d If not, you could argue, after multiple major protests, and any number of arrests, that this is a good moment for a strategic review. To build on its achievements and extract change, XR must find a way, as Occupy and other mobilisations have not, of sustaining participation, whether mass or niche. That seems less, not more, likely to happen if some of its affinity groups appear, and not only in Canning Town, to regard fellow citizens as incidental to their higher purpose. Having said that, I\u2019ve never had the chance to be educated when already late for work, by a retired vicar, stuck to a tube door. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

The grown-up accoutrements I collected in London \u2013 the vintage mother-of-pearl cuff links, the Brooks Brothers shirts, the Paul Smith socks \u2013 I sort of left behind.

Dan Rookwood, formerly US editor of the menswear site <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/\" title=\"\">Mr Porter</a>, was once rarely seen without at least eight items of exquisite tailoring. He has recently taken a job as creative director at Nike, moved from New York to Portland, and adjusted his attire accordingly. \u201cI now have the best wardrobe I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 a proper walk-in wardrobe, where I can see all my clothes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what it shows me is that I can\u2019t wear the vast majority of it any more. It\u2019s all made-to-measure suits and shirts and ties and bench-made shoes that I just can\u2019t see myself wearing outside the occasional wedding as the winds of style have changed.

But if you look at what men were wearing in 2014 compared to 2019, it is markedly different. This is a big change. We\u2019re just not as buttoned up as we were.\u201d The emphasis has moved from fine tailoring to luxury streetwear; from Milan and London to New York and Los Angeles; from Don Draper on the front of <em>GQ</em> to Kanye West on the sneaker site <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/\" title=\"\">Highsnobiety</a>.

There\u2019s a feeling of permanence in this shift, a once-and-for-all changing of the guard. You might cherish an idea of a father taking his son out to buy his first suit. Now a father is more likely to ask his son where to get a limited-edition Supreme hoodie. In any case, today\u2019s 40- and 50-somethings grew up in a world of hip-hop and punk and trainers and tees.

It was a process that required a certain self-knowledge. I suppose there\u2019s no reason why luxury streetwear shouldn\u2019t provide the same journey. I mean, when Frank Ocean sings about Nikes, it sounds like a meaningful relationship. But one thing that troubles me about this new power-dressing is the emphasis on branding, labels, items that cost hundreds of pounds not because an apprenticed tailor has spent a long time crafting it, but simply because that\u2019s what the market says this thing is worth. Enforced sneakerdom is its own tyranny.</p> <p>Coggins suggests we have come to place too high a value on comfort as a society. \u201cIt used to be accepted that you would go through stages of slight discomfort to have an education. So you would read difficult books, or you\u2019d sit through some operas, and maybe the first time you didn\u2019t like it, but you would learn to like it \u2013 or at least appreciate what it is at stake. Now there\u2019s this thought that comfort is everything. People dress as if they\u2019re at home all the time, and they act like they\u2019re at home when they\u2019re in public. It\u2019s why people lie down on the floor in airports and Facetime in restaurants and put their feet up on train seats.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s another aspect of this that troubles me. One of the pleasures of wearing a suit to work, for me, was shedding it when I got home. Now there is less distinction between work and home, on and off, public and private. I might be answering a work email at 10.37pm, I might be having a nap at 3.07pm, I might be tapping away in a caf\u00e9 a 11.45am on a Sunday while families brunch around me.</p> <p>Some freelancers I consult cherish the freedom of working in their pyjamas \u2013 \u201cIf you can\u2019t motivate yourself without a literal suit on, maybe freelancing is not for your temperament,\u201d says one. Another notes the environmental cost of maintaining a full office wardrobe with a different outfit each day. But others warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottoms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Freelancers warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottoms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Personally, I\u2019m usually in some smart-casual-compromise outfit that is neither truly smart nor truly casual. Maybe some overly formal trousers and some underly white Stan Smiths. Maybe a canvas tote bag with my laptop in it, or a shirt that could use an iron \u2013 but am I going to iron a shirt for the school run?</p> <p>I am more often than not in trainers. I find brogues or loafers make a huge clomping noise on the laminate floor of my co-working space. And when I come up to London, I\u2019m often, literally, running between meetings. I can\u2019t help thinking that the move towards trainers as acceptable workwear has a lot to do with the fact that work is now so much a question of inputs and outputs; life is just hectic; we\u2019re expected to \u201cperform\u201d like athletes. But the trainer is also the footwear of the retired, the overleisured, the underemployed.</p> <p>In Nikolai Goncharov\u2019s 1859 novel <em>Oblomov</em>, the dressing gown worn by the title character \u2013 <em>khalat</em> in Russian \u2013 becomes a symbol of the turpitude of the archetypal 19th-century \u201csuperfluous man\u201d. There is even a word in Russian \u2013 <em>khalatnost</em>, \u201cdressing-gown-ness\u201d \u2013 to describe the condition. I wonder what the 21st-century equivalent would be. Sneakerness? Jerseyness? Dressing-down-ness?</p> <p>I say I never wear a suit and tie any more. The one exception was a recent 20-year university reunion which required all of the men to dress in \u201clounge suits\u201d. Everyone remarked on how they never wore suits and ties these days. Everyone spent the evening complimenting one another. And everyone, I sensed, enjoyed looking their unashamed best. What if you never had the chance to look your best again? What kind of future would that be?</p>",

Another notes the environmental cost of maintaining a full office wardrobe with a different outfit each day. But others warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottoms. Personally, I\u2019m usually in some smart-casual-compromise outfit that is neither truly smart nor truly casual. Maybe some overly formal trousers and some underly white Stan Smiths. Maybe a canvas tote bag with my laptop in it, or a shirt that could use an iron \u2013 but am I going to iron a shirt for the school run? I am more often than not in trainers. I find brogues or loafers make a huge clomping noise on the laminate floor of my co-working space. And when I come up to London, I\u2019m often, literally, running between meetings. I can\u2019t help thinking that the move towards trainers as acceptable workwear has a lot to do with the fact that work is now so much a question of inputs and outputs; life is just hectic; we\u2019re expected to \u201cperform\u201d like athletes. But the trainer is also the footwear of the retired, the overleisured, the underemployed. In Nikolai Goncharov\u2019s 1859 novel Oblomov, the dressing gown worn by the title character \u2013 khalat in Russian \u2013 becomes a symbol of the turpitude of the archetypal 19th-century \u201csuperfluous man\u201d. There is even a word in Russian \u2013 khalatnost, \u201cdressing-gown-ness\u201d \u2013 to describe the condition. I wonder what the 21st-century equivalent would be. Sneakerness? Jerseyness? Dressing-down-ness? I say I never wear a suit and tie any more. The one exception was a recent 20-year university reunion which required all of the men to dress in \u201clounge suits\u201d. Everyone remarked on how they never wore suits and ties these days. Everyone spent the evening complimenting one another. And everyone, I sensed, enjoyed looking their unashamed best. What if you never had the chance to look your best again? What kind of future would that be?",

It is long overdue that this attempt to curb children\u2019s access to online pornography is scrapped. Almost two years ago, a close colleague and I sat in a meeting with one of the policymakers who had recently been asked to implement the proposal. The pained look on his face when we queried his progress confirmed our suspicions that it was an impossible task. It was clear to many that the block could \u2013 and would \u2013 never come to pass.</p> <p>The plan did not have just one achilles heel \u2013 it had many.</p> <p>First, there were privacy concerns. By requiring identification such as credit card details to access online pornography, it would have created a potentially explosive data set linking personal identification to private sexual information. A gold mine for leaks and hacks.</p> <p>Anyone who was a teenager, or knows one, also recognises how quickly such a block would be circumvented: you would only need a parent\u2019s credit card, a virtual private network or black-market proxy.</p> <p>Second, if a user does not own a credit card or other form of identification such as a driver\u2019s licence, their option would be to verify their age at an approved store, a post office, for example. This would have put up barriers for people with little access to documentation to do something they have every right to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scientists and other stakeholders cannot access information about what the population is actually doing online</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After continuous delays, the porn block was quietly scrapped last week. But the government is working on its next digital dilemma. In her written statement, the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, stated that the block would now be integrated into legislation announced in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper\" title=\"\">Online Harms white paper</a>. This paper, however, is just another instance of the government rushing to proclaim unimplementable digital policy proposals when subjected to public pressure.</p> <p>The beginning of 2019 was marked by the tragic suicide of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/04/instagram-to-launch-sensitivity-screens-after-molly-russell-death\" title=\"\">Molly Russell</a>, whose family spoke compellingly in the media about the dangers of self-harm images on Instagram. This public pressure led to the expedited release of the Online Harms white paper, which, like the porn block, sounded good initially but now looks more like a PR statement than sustainable policy.</p> <p>The government failed to define an online harm: how do you classify harm if some content on the internet is harmful for some, but not for others? Furthermore, no detail was provided about how companies would be held to account for this undefined harm. The new white paper is, therefore, just kicking the problem of policing the internet down the road; like the porn block, it seeks to alleviate the electorate\u2019s worries by proposing policy that seems too good to be true.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system\">UK drops plans for online pornography age verification system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Politicians need to engage in difficult debates with public and industry in order to design policy proposals that go beyond pacifying the population to provide actionable results. We need to rapidly understand how new digital technologies affect our society.</p> <p>Such progress is, however, almost impossible because scientists and other stakeholders cannot access information about what the population is actually doing online. Even though such data is stored aplenty on servers of technology companies, it is proprietary information and out of bounds for public research.</p> <p>Concurrently, technology companies use this same data to understand us and fine-tune their algorithms. It is time politicians enabled public research to inform policy proposals that are fit for purpose in the digital age.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Amy Orben is a research fellow at Emmanuel College and the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences unit, University of Cambridge</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK government\u2019s porn block was a dead man walking for months, if not years. It is long overdue that this attempt to curb children\u2019s access to online pornography is scrapped. Almost two years ago, a close colleague and I sat in a meeting with one of the policymakers who had recently been asked to implement the proposal. The pained look on his face when we queried his progress confirmed our suspicions that it was an impossible task. It was clear to many that the block could \u2013 and would \u2013 never come to pass. The plan did not have just one achilles heel \u2013 it had many. First, there were privacy concerns. By requiring identification such as credit card details to access online pornography, it would have created a potentially explosive data set linking personal identification to private sexual information. A gold mine for leaks and hacks. Anyone who was a teenager, or knows one, also recognises how quickly such a block would be circumvented: you would only need a parent\u2019s credit card, a virtual private network or black-market proxy. Second, if a user does not own a credit card or other form of identification such as a driver\u2019s licence, their option would be to verify their age at an approved store, a post office, for example. This would have put up barriers for people with little access to documentation to do something they have every right to do. After continuous delays, the porn block was quietly scrapped last week. But the government is working on its next digital dilemma. In her written statement, the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, stated that the block would now be integrated into legislation announced in the Online Harms white paper. This paper, however, is just another instance of the government rushing to proclaim unimplementable digital policy proposals when subjected to public pressure. The beginning of 2019 was marked by the tragic suicide of Molly Russell, whose family spoke compellingly in the media about the dangers of self-harm images on Instagram. This public pressure led to the expedited release of the Online Harms white paper, which, like the porn block, sounded good initially but now looks more like a PR statement than sustainable policy. The government failed to define an online harm: how do you classify harm if some content on the internet is harmful for some, but not for others? Furthermore, no detail was provided about how companies would be held to account for this undefined harm. The new white paper is, therefore, just kicking the problem of policing the internet down the road; like the porn block, it seeks to alleviate the electorate\u2019s worries by proposing policy that seems too good to be true. Politicians need to engage in difficult debates with public and industry in order to design policy proposals that go beyond pacifying the population to provide actionable results. We need to rapidly understand how new digital technologies affect our society. Such progress is, however, almost impossible because scientists and other stakeholders cannot access information about what the population is actually doing online. Even though such data is stored aplenty on servers of technology companies, it is proprietary information and out of bounds for public research. Concurrently, technology companies use this same data to understand us and fine-tune their algorithms. It is time politicians enabled public research to inform policy proposals that are fit for purpose in the digital age. \u2022 Dr Amy Orben is a research fellow at Emmanuel College and the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences unit, University of Cambridge",

      "body": "<p>It was billed as Super Saturday \u2013 the first weekend sitting of parliament in more than 30 years. Three years after the referendum, with passionate Remain campaigners gathering at the Palace of Westminster\u2019s gates, would MPs vote for a Brexit deal that would finally get Britain out of the EU?</p> <p>Yet, as is fitting for the tortuous debate around Brexit that has engulfed and paralysed parliament, the dramatic day ended with a further delay and senior MPs believing Downing Street was hatching another plan to force through its deal.</p> <p>In between came an extraordinary cocktail of parliamentary drama, agonised decisions and political scheming. The chamber was full to bursting by the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> rose to his feet as the session opened. The penalty for non-attendance was clearly high. One MP had struggled in despite having had an operation earlier in the week.</p> <p>With the numbers on a knife-edge, his opening address was aimed at his real audience. Gone were the accusations of surrender that had so angered MPs weeks earlier. He had dropped the combative tone in favour of a low-key, calm cross-party appeal.</p> <p>He said he would \u201ccontinue to listen\u201d to MPs throughout the day and \u201cmeet with anyone on any side\u201d. He said he believed Britain would keep the \u201cbest tradition of the highest standards of environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights. No one anywhere in this chamber believes in lowering standards,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead we believe in improving them.\u201d</p> <p>There was no surprise in his pitch. With Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP MPs abandoning Johnson because of the way the region was being treated in his deal, it had become clear that the key to victory would come from independent and Labour MPs, who had long wavered over voting through Brexit but never gone through with it. And they were, believed many Labour and government sources, almost ready to do the deed.</p> <p>There was just one problem. A big one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/oliverletwin\" title=\"\">Oliver Letwin</a>\u2019s amendment, which would be voted on before MPs got the chance to vote on Johnson\u2019s deal, would make it clear that final approval was being withheld until the legislation needed to implement it was in place. It was an insurance policy, drawn up by the former cabinet minister to stop Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal should the government fail to pass the new laws needed. If the Letwin amendment passed, the government would not get its moment of truth on the new Brexit deal.</p> <p>A huge operation had been launched to change Letwin\u2019s mind about tabling his amendment. He was brought into Downing Street on Friday night to discuss it. Yet their best efforts could not sway him. By Saturday morning, No 10 aides were openly frustrated. The meaningful vote would become another \u201cmeaningless vote\u201d, they said, prolonging the Brexit agony. Despite rumours of Letwin\u2019s plan circulating for a week in Westminster, they were blindsided by its effects. \u201cI\u2019m just frustrated because I really thought we could get there today,\u201d said one government official.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89e913e122e9740ba80b3964f955a4a7186fb832\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89e913e122e9740ba80b3964f955a4a7186fb832/127_45_1978_1187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MP Oliver Letwin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Letwin was called into Downing Street to change his mind on his plan on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While speeches were taking place in the chamber, with the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer making a powerful intervention about how troubling details of the deal had not been properly scrutinised, a frantic whipping operation was taking place. There were two dynamics at work. On the plus side for the government, the chances of building a precious majority in favour of the Brexit deal were rising. However, a majority for the Letwin plan also seemed to be in the offing.</p> <p>Good news for the government had come that morning, when the hardline European Research Group decided to back the deal. That began a domino effect that saw all the hardline pro-Brexit Tory MPs fall in line. </p> <p>Then there was the swing group of former Tory MPs who had lost the whip over opposing a no-deal Brexit. Could they be won over? Government officials hinted that some could be offered the party whip back if they voted the right way. They were boosted when two, Steve Brine and Alistair Burt, said they would vote for Johnson and against Letwin. </p> <p>As for the Labour whips, could they stop their MPs backing the Brexit plan? Things seemed to be getting serious when one of them was spotted carrying a roll of thick, black duct tape. In reality, the whips felt they had been hugely helped by an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/18/no-deal-brexit-still-possible-under-new-agreement-says-mp\" title=\"\">John Baron, a member of the ERG</a>, who had said he backed the Johnson deal because it left open the possibility of a no-deal Brexit once the transition period finished at the end of next year. That had made their argument for them \u2013 that Johnson could not be trusted to deliver protections to workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards that he had been using to attract Labour MPs to his cause.</p> <p>Suddenly, it looked like Letwin\u2019s attempt to reserve judgment on the new Brexit plan might fall short. The key now appeared to be the DUP. They would not vote for Johnson\u2019s deal, but could the government at least persuade them not to vote for Letwin\u2019s delay? Johnson decided to try to speak to them. Everything seemed to hang on how they would vote.</p> <p>When the votes came, supporters of Letwin\u2019s plan to delay the crucial votes on Brexit were worried. The DUP had not turned up to vote immediately. Had they been persuaded to abstain? With just a minute to go, they appeared and voted for Letwin. Their support turned out to be crucial, with their 10 votes deciding the result.</p> <p>Victory for the Letwin amendment meant that Johnson had to send a letter demanding a Brexit extension from the EU. Yet in an extraordinary moment, Downing Street aides refused to confirm to journalists that the letter would be sent. \u201cGovernments obey the law,\u201d was the only comment, pointing instead to Johnson\u2019s vow that he would not negotiate a further Brexit delay.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I really have no idea what is going on!</p> <footer> <cite>Government minister</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Outside parliament, the blare of the People\u2019s Vote rally could be heard. Yet in a now almost empty chamber, another twist emerged. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, announced that , the government intended to try the whole thing all over again \u2013 and have another meaningful vote on the Johnson deal.</p> <p>As he left Westminster, Letwin said it was a \u201cblatant attempt to reverse\u201d the safeguards against no deal that his successful amendment had put in place just hours earlier. By having another meaningful vote, he said, the government could effectively tear up the extension letter written to the EU and ensure that the choice facing MPs was \u201cmy deal or no deal\u201d by the end of the month. Suspicious at what was unfolding, the speaker indicated he wouldn\u2019t let the government stage such a vote. It sets up another week of extraordinary votes \u2013 and adds more complication to the tortured Brexit story.</p> <p>\u201cGames, games, games,\u201d said one former cabinet minister, heading home. \u201cPeople out there thought we were coming here today to make a decision. And now we have to do it all again.\u201d</p> <p>Another minister spoke for many. \u201cI really have no idea what is going on!\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was billed as Super Saturday \u2013 the first weekend sitting of parliament in more than 30 years. Three years after the referendum, with passionate Remain campaigners gathering at the Palace of Westminster\u2019s gates, would MPs vote for a Brexit deal that would finally get Britain out of the EU? Yet, as is fitting for the tortuous debate around Brexit that has engulfed and paralysed parliament, the dramatic day ended with a further delay and senior MPs believing Downing Street was hatching another plan to force through its deal. In between came an extraordinary cocktail of parliamentary drama, agonised decisions and political scheming. The chamber was full to bursting by the time Boris Johnson rose to his feet as the session opened. The penalty for non-attendance was clearly high. One MP had struggled in despite having had an operation earlier in the week. With the numbers on a knife-edge, his opening address was aimed at his real audience. Gone were the accusations of surrender that had so angered MPs weeks earlier. He had dropped the combative tone in favour of a low-key, calm cross-party appeal. He said he would \u201ccontinue to listen\u201d to MPs throughout the day and \u201cmeet with anyone on any side\u201d. He said he believed Britain would keep the \u201cbest tradition of the highest standards of environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights. No one anywhere in this chamber believes in lowering standards,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead we believe in improving them.\u201d There was no surprise in his pitch. With Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP MPs abandoning Johnson because of the way the region was being treated in his deal, it had become clear that the key to victory would come from independent and Labour MPs, who had long wavered over voting through Brexit but never gone through with it. And they were, believed many Labour and government sources, almost ready to do the deed. There was just one problem. A big one. Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment, which would be voted on before MPs got the chance to vote on Johnson\u2019s deal, would make it clear that final approval was being withheld until the legislation needed to implement it was in place. It was an insurance policy, drawn up by the former cabinet minister to stop Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal should the government fail to pass the new laws needed. If the Letwin amendment passed, the government would not get its moment of truth on the new Brexit deal. A huge operation had been launched to change Letwin\u2019s mind about tabling his amendment. He was brought into Downing Street on Friday night to discuss it. Yet their best efforts could not sway him. By Saturday morning, No 10 aides were openly frustrated. The meaningful vote would become another \u201cmeaningless vote\u201d, they said, prolonging the Brexit agony. Despite rumours of Letwin\u2019s plan circulating for a week in Westminster, they were blindsided by its effects. \u201cI\u2019m just frustrated because I really thought we could get there today,\u201d said one government official. While speeches were taking place in the chamber, with the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer making a powerful intervention about how troubling details of the deal had not been properly scrutinised, a frantic whipping operation was taking place. There were two dynamics at work. On the plus side for the government, the chances of building a precious majority in favour of the Brexit deal were rising. However, a majority for the Letwin plan also seemed to be in the offing. Good news for the government had come that morning, when the hardline European Research Group decided to back the deal. That began a domino effect that saw all the hardline pro-Brexit Tory MPs fall in line. Then there was the swing group of former Tory MPs who had lost the whip over opposing a no-deal Brexit. Could they be won over? Government officials hinted that some could be offered the party whip back if they voted the right way. They were boosted when two, Steve Brine and Alistair Burt, said they would vote for Johnson and against Letwin. As for the Labour whips, could they stop their MPs backing the Brexit plan? Things seemed to be getting serious when one of them was spotted carrying a roll of thick, black duct tape. In reality, the whips felt they had been hugely helped by an interview with John Baron, a member of the ERG, who had said he backed the Johnson deal because it left open the possibility of a no-deal Brexit once the transition period finished at the end of next year. That had made their argument for them \u2013 that Johnson could not be trusted to deliver protections to workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards that he had been using to attract Labour MPs to his cause. Suddenly, it looked like Letwin\u2019s attempt to reserve judgment on the new Brexit plan might fall short. The key now appeared to be the DUP. They would not vote for Johnson\u2019s deal, but could the government at least persuade them not to vote for Letwin\u2019s delay? Johnson decided to try to speak to them. Everything seemed to hang on how they would vote. When the votes came, supporters of Letwin\u2019s plan to delay the crucial votes on Brexit were worried. The DUP had not turned up to vote immediately. Had they been persuaded to abstain? With just a minute to go, they appeared and voted for Letwin. Their support turned out to be crucial, with their 10 votes deciding the result. Victory for the Letwin amendment meant that Johnson had to send a letter demanding a Brexit extension from the EU. Yet in an extraordinary moment, Downing Street aides refused to confirm to journalists that the letter would be sent. \u201cGovernments obey the law,\u201d was the only comment, pointing instead to Johnson\u2019s vow that he would not negotiate a further Brexit delay. Outside parliament, the blare of the People\u2019s Vote rally could be heard. Yet in a now almost empty chamber, another twist emerged. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, announced that , the government intended to try the whole thing all over again \u2013 and have another meaningful vote on the Johnson deal. As he left Westminster, Letwin said it was a \u201cblatant attempt to reverse\u201d the safeguards against no deal that his successful amendment had put in place just hours earlier. By having another meaningful vote, he said, the government could effectively tear up the extension letter written to the EU and ensure that the choice facing MPs was \u201cmy deal or no deal\u201d by the end of the month. Suspicious at what was unfolding, the speaker indicated he wouldn\u2019t let the government stage such a vote. It sets up another week of extraordinary votes \u2013 and adds more complication to the tortured Brexit story. \u201cGames, games, games,\u201d said one former cabinet minister, heading home. \u201cPeople out there thought we were coming here today to make a decision. And now we have to do it all again.\u201d Another minister spoke for many. \u201cI really have no idea what is going on!\u201d",

But it is not the job of England\u2019s players to lead by example in the face of racist abuse.

This was also about structural racism: forms of prejudice in which black people are told that their own lived experiences are merely interpretations or opinions. Mings told an interviewer that the racist chants had begun during the warm-up, before kick-off. Yet even after the match, the Bulgaria manager, Krasimir Balakov, claimed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear anything\u201d.

Yet what happened on Monday was both predictable and widely predicted. There had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/02/bulgaria-englandfootballteam\" title=\"\">racist chanting</a> directed against England players in the same stadium eight years ago during a European Championship qualifier. Any football authority serious about combating racism would have taken action <em>before</em> the match, not after.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Boris Johnson condemned on Twitter what he called the \u201cvile racism we saw and heard last night\u201d, saying it had \u201cno place in football or anywhere else\u201d. But this support arrives from a prime minister who, in 2002, when many of England\u2019s black players were infants, described black children as \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d, the same term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/feb/15/race.world\" title=\"\">Enoch Powell</a> deployed in his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech.</p> <p>The contrast between the leadership displayed by the England team and the lack of leadership in politics was further demonstrated during the post-match press conference. There, the England manager could have done the easy thing \u2013 condemned the Bulgarian fans and then soaked up the glory of a victory achieved under the most difficult of conditions. Southgate instead showed what leadership looks like. Diverting the attention away from himself and on to his players (as he consistently does), he took the path of most resistance, and invited the English game to look at itself in the mirror. \u201cSadly, my players, because of their experiences in our own country, are hardened to racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that says about our society, but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you want to feel good about Britain right now, or at least England, where do you look? Not to our parliament, in the latter stages of its descent into something close to chaos, the green spaces around the Palace of Westminster slowly being churned into mud by ceaseless protests. And there is little comfort to be had turning to our prime minister, a man so renowned for dishonesty that the likelihood that he will break his word is baked into the political calculations of his opponents. Across the world, our reputation as a serious-minded, pragmatic (even perfidious) nation is in tatters and our former sense of ourselves as a reasonable, level-headed, no-nonsense people is difficult to sustain after the past three and half years of political turmoil. One place we could look last week for signs of the seriousness and professionalism for which we were once known was a stadium in Bulgaria. There, a group of twentysomething players and their manager stood huddled together, under the floodlights, facing what their manager later described as an \u201cimpossible situation\u201d. If you want leadership, it was there in abundance. Not just in the calm thoughtfulness of Gareth Southgate, but in Tyrone Mings, the 26-year-old whose England debut came on the night he and his teammates were subjected to torrents of racist abuse. It came from sections of the Bulgarian fans who, clustered together \u2013 many dressed in black, their faces half concealed by hoods \u2013 made monkey chants and gave Nazi salutes. Despite the grimness of it all, despite the two stoppages in the first half and the sheer awful predictability of it all, Mings and his teammates went on to defeat Bulgaria 6-0 and navigate the impossibility of the night. That the England team represents the best of the nation shows not just how much they have risen under Southgate\u2019s management, but how much the England they represent has fallen. For decades, we were regarded as a consistent and reliable nation with an inconsistent and unreliable football team. Now the opposite is true. Many commentators wrote of how England\u2019s players had shown \u201cdignity\u201d, played through their torment and \u201clet their feet do the talking\u201d. But it is not the job of England\u2019s players to lead by example in the face of racist abuse. The job of stamping out racism in European football falls to Uefa, an institution that had almost as bad a night as the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU). Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol for dealing with racism from supporters, although followed by the England players and officials, was shown in Sofia to be deeply flawed. The first step is for the team subjected to abuse to report it to the referee, who then arranges for a stadium announcement to be made requesting that the chanting stop. The illogicality and seemingly wilful naivety of that part of the protocol was highlighted by the sports psychologist Dr Peter Olusoga (he\u2019s my younger brother), who questioned whether \u201cpolitely asking racist thugs if perhaps they might consider not being racist, you know, if it\u2019s not too much trouble\u201d is a flawed approach. \u201cImagine in any other job hearing, \u2018Yeah, so I know that racists are screaming at you while you\u2019re trying to work, but are you OK to keep working?\u2019\u201d Yet the overt racism that echoed around the stadium is only part of the story. This was also about structural racism: forms of prejudice in which black people are told that their own lived experiences are merely interpretations or opinions. Mings told an interviewer that the racist chants had begun during the warm-up, before kick-off. Yet even after the match, the Bulgaria manager, Krasimir Balakov, claimed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear anything\u201d. Worse, he demanded that before any action is taken the racism that England\u2019s players had suffered had to be \u201cproved to be true\u201d. Balakov was not just being disingenuous, he was gaslighting England\u2019s black players, calling their honesty and professionalism into question, defending the indefensible, minimising what had happened and helping to drag football into the post-truth era. Balakov\u2019s resignation on Friday, which followed that of the president of the BFU, Borislav Mikhailov, might be taken as signs that last week\u2019s events have finally stunned the Bulgarians into action. Yet what happened on Monday was both predictable and widely predicted. There had been racist chanting directed against England players in the same stadium eight years ago during a European Championship qualifier. Any football authority serious about combating racism would have taken action before the match, not after. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson condemned on Twitter what he called the \u201cvile racism we saw and heard last night\u201d, saying it had \u201cno place in football or anywhere else\u201d. But this support arrives from a prime minister who, in 2002, when many of England\u2019s black players were infants, described black children as \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d, the same term Enoch Powell deployed in his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech. The contrast between the leadership displayed by the England team and the lack of leadership in politics was further demonstrated during the post-match press conference. There, the England manager could have done the easy thing \u2013 condemned the Bulgarian fans and then soaked up the glory of a victory achieved under the most difficult of conditions. Southgate instead showed what leadership looks like. Diverting the attention away from himself and on to his players (as he consistently does), he took the path of most resistance, and invited the English game to look at itself in the mirror. \u201cSadly, my players, because of their experiences in our own country, are hardened to racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that says about our society, but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d \u2022 David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster",

I have exhausted the resources to make the investigation work.\u201d</p> <p>But <em>Blood, Coal, Money</em> provides an explanation. In addition to the lurid allegations it makes against Shchukin, the document tracks the flow of money to London from the Shchukin family\u2019s chief asset, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/13/battle-coal-mine-russian-billionaire-uk-lehram\" title=\"\">Polosukhinskaya mine</a> in Siberia, which produces high-grade coking coal for use in power stations, and is held in a trust in Cyprus.

Korobko, too, claims to have been paid only a nominal fee. The son of a miner, he apparently wanted to help the Lazarevich family.</p> <p>Their efforts attracted the interest of Lib Dem peer Lord Razzall, who agreed to host the Westminster dinner at which Anna Lazarevich spoke, and Tory MP Sir Henry Bellingham. Bellingham pledged to take up the case. \u201cWe need to reset the dial on the relationship between the UK and Russia,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em> in May.</p> <p>Anna\u2019s story about her brother\u2019s disappearance was crucial in winning the politicians\u2019 support. \u201cI came out of the meeting with Anna Lazarevich very impressed and just wanted to see justice done,\u201d Bellingham said. He urged the UK to \u201cuse the National Crime Agency to track or chase any illicit funds attached to this criminal case\u201d. Razzall also wanted the NCA involved.</p> <p>But by June things were starting to unravel. A treasure trove of purportedly hacked emails, leaked to journalists, raised troubling questions about the true intentions of those behind the campaign which, it emerged, had a codename \u2013 \u201cProject Pike\u201d \u2013 <em>shchuka</em> meaning pike in Russian.</p> <p>One email exchange revealed that those pushing the campaign insisted on paying Sans Fronti\u00e8res only if the PR firm succeeded in getting stories into the media to promote the anti-Shchukin documentary.</p> <p>Sans Fronti\u00e8res says that it refused the demands. But emails show the firm did draw up an indicative price list, charging \u00a340,000 for a \u201cstory placement in a Tier 1 or national news publication in the UK\u201d and \u00a350,000 for any video featured in \u201ca Tier 1 broadcaster\u201d. Clips uploaded to YouTube were priced at \u00a35,000. The firm insists no payment was ever received and the project to promote the documentary never got off the ground.</p> <p>Then a murky story that had mutated from a quest for justice to one about black propaganda became murkier still. It transpired that some of the hacked emails were fake. Others contained false information.</p> <p>One such email purportedly showed an aide to Chris Bryant, the Labour MP who formerly <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/opinion/house-commons/91428/chris-bryant-mp-mps-must-be-ready-act-against\" title=\"\">chaired the </a><a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/opinion/house-commons/91428/chris-bryant-mp-mps-must-be-ready-act-against\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group on Russia</a>, organising an event to discuss what action the UK could take against Shchukin and Uzbekov.

      "bodyText": "On 21 December 2016 Evgeny Lazarevich, a 55-year-old father to four daughters, disappeared in the Kemerovo region of Siberia. A week later his Ford Explorer was found in the city of Novokuznetsk, 30 miles from the coalmine where he worked as its administrator, overseeing its liquidation. According to his sister, Anna, the car\u2019s number plate had been removed and its inside sprayed with pepper \u201cso police dogs would not take the trail\u201d. Nothing has been heard of him since, except for one, sinister postscript. The following March, Lazarevich\u2019s mother, Tamara, received two calls on her mobile phone. \u201cMama, mama,\u201d her son said before the line went dead. Now, desperate for answers, his family have escalated their efforts to find him. Curiously, though, their efforts have been focused not on Siberia, nor even Russia, but on London where a small army of PR agents, private investigators and lawyers have been working behind the scenes to push the story of Lazarevich\u2019s disappearance to politicians and journalists. That so many people are engaged in establishing the truth of what happened to one man appears laudable. But the truth is more complicated. For Lazarevich\u2019s disappearance is just one plotline in a larger story about feuding oligarchs who view the UK\u2019s media, parliament and courts as pawns on a giant chessboard. It is a story that offers a rare insight into how, in their unyielding battle for supremacy, truths and untruths collide so frequently that it is impossible to discern where fact ends and fiction begins. Add in death threats, organised crime, tax havens and well-connected Kremlin supporters, and the comparison with the BBC\u2019s McMafia television drama becomes all but inevitable. But back to Lazarevich. Like many other Siberian mine administrators, he was subject to intimidation from organised criminal gangs who wanted to acquire coal illegally. On one occasion he was kidnapped by a gang who wanted him to sign documents handing over his mine. On another he was arrested on what his family say were trumped-up charges. In 2016, Lazarevich\u2019s family say he decided to testify against a powerful mining magnate, Alexander Shchukin. A former mining engineer with an uncompromising persona, Shchukin amassed a fortune in the wild west Russia of the 90s, when as part of a consortium of businessmen he acquired mines and other industrial interests in Siberia. At one stage Forbes suggested his wealth totalled more than $1.8bn(\u00a31.4bn). But his influence had begun to wane and in November 2016, a month before Lazarevich disappeared, Shchukin was charged with extorting the shares in a coalmine, a charge he denies. There are no documents to corroborate Anna Lazarevich\u2019s claim about her brother\u2019s willingness to testify against the magnate, who is currently under house arrest, only letters she wrote to the authorities alleging this was the case. \u201cMy brother wanted justice,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cHe was a decent person and a man of principle. He was ready to testify against Shchukin and his gang.\u201d She made similar claims when she appeared earlier this year at a specially organised dinner in Westminster in which an extraordinary 31-page document, titled Blood Coal Money \u2013 which made a series of uncorroborated allegations against the magnate \u2013 was shared with a network of influential people including an MP, a peer, eminent lawyers and at least one former spy. Ostensibly the document was produced as part of a crowd-funded appeal for justice by miners who held Shchukin responsible for Lazarevich\u2019s disappearance. It suggested that Lazarevich had been digging up evidence against the oligarch and, on the night he vanished, he was on his way to meet an associate of Shchukin\u2019s lawyer, apparently wearing a wire-tap. In a statement, Shchukin\u2019s representatives said: \u201cMr Shchukin is neither accused nor a suspect in respect of this disappearance, which took place after Mr Shchukin was already under arrest. He\u2019s never had business dealings or relations with Mr Lazarevich or the mine in which Mr Lazarevich acted as a bankruptcy trustee.\u201d Why Anna Lazarevich believed that British parliamentarians would be interested in the disappearance of a Siberian coalmine administrator is, at first glance, unclear. \u201cI have neither financial nor political interests,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cI am interested in the fate of my brother and the opportunity to at least find his body. I have exhausted the resources to make the investigation work.\u201d But Blood, Coal, Money provides an explanation. In addition to the lurid allegations it makes against Shchukin, the document tracks the flow of money to London from the Shchukin family\u2019s chief asset, the Polosukhinskaya mine in Siberia, which produces high-grade coking coal for use in power stations, and is held in a trust in Cyprus. The chief beneficiaries of this trust are Shchukin\u2019s daughter, Elena Shchukina, and her husband, Ildar Uzbekov, who live in a \u00a315m mansion in Highgate, north London. The document makes much of the juxtaposition between the harsh conditions of workers in Siberia and the gilded lifestyle enjoyed by Shchukina, who runs an art gallery in Mayfair. \u201cWe toil for black bread in Siberia,\u201d it states above a photograph of weary-looking miners. \u201cMeanwhile in Mayfair, the daughter of [Shchukin] is feasting,\u201d it adds, explaining that a single glass of wine at Shchukina\u2019s favourite restaurant can apparently cost \u00a3850 \u2013 \u201cnearly FIVE times the miner\u2019s monthly pension\u201d. Shchukina and her husband are no strangers to such attacks. Earlier this year they found themselves the subject of an extraordinary film, produced to accompany Blood, Coal Money, which made outlandish claims about the relationship between the secret intelligence service, MI6, and Uzbekov. The London premiere \u2013 promoted on a London bus \u2013 was cancelled when Uzbekov brought libel proceedings, one of many he has pursued in recent years as he engages in what oligarchs call \u201clawfare\u201d \u2013 legal action against assorted enemies in multiple jurisdictions. In a strange twist of life mirroring art, the putative guest list for the film\u2019s premiere, seen by the Observer, indicates that the film\u2019s makers had intended to invite the McMafia actor, James Norton, and the journalist on whose book the series was based, Misha Glenny. Shortly after her speech to parliamentarians, in which she called on the British and Russian authorities to coordinate an investigation into her brother\u2019s disappearance, Anna Lazarevich was introduced to the Observer by Sans Fronti\u00e8res, the PR firm set up by the late spin guru, Lord Bell, who promised to put the newspaper in touch with several of her powerful supporters. At one stage this newspaper was promised an interview, though the offer was later withdrawn, with Stanislav Antipin, the first secretary at the Russian embassy in London. Antipin was not the only Kremlin advocate raising concerns about Lazarevich\u2019s disappearance. Alexander Korobko, a Russian journalist who wrote a favourable biography of President Putin and directed a documentary-style film exonerating Andrei Lugovoi, chief suspect in the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, was also on the Lazarevich campaign. So too was Dr Andrei Liakhov, a well-connected former Russian military officer who was injured in a chemical-weapons attack in Afghanistan, and who, during an interview with the Observer, held up his mobile phone to reveal that it apparently contained a number for President Putin. \u201cYou only ring this number when you have something to say,\u201d Liakhov explained. Liakhov told the Observer he had become involved in the campaign because he believed in getting justice for Lazarevich, not because he was being paid. Korobko, too, claims to have been paid only a nominal fee. The son of a miner, he apparently wanted to help the Lazarevich family. Their efforts attracted the interest of Lib Dem peer Lord Razzall, who agreed to host the Westminster dinner at which Anna Lazarevich spoke, and Tory MP Sir Henry Bellingham. Bellingham pledged to take up the case. \u201cWe need to reset the dial on the relationship between the UK and Russia,\u201d he told the Observer in May. Anna\u2019s story about her brother\u2019s disappearance was crucial in winning the politicians\u2019 support. \u201cI came out of the meeting with Anna Lazarevich very impressed and just wanted to see justice done,\u201d Bellingham said. He urged the UK to \u201cuse the National Crime Agency to track or chase any illicit funds attached to this criminal case\u201d. Razzall also wanted the NCA involved. But by June things were starting to unravel. A treasure trove of purportedly hacked emails, leaked to journalists, raised troubling questions about the true intentions of those behind the campaign which, it emerged, had a codename \u2013 \u201cProject Pike\u201d \u2013 shchuka meaning pike in Russian. One email exchange revealed that those pushing the campaign insisted on paying Sans Fronti\u00e8res only if the PR firm succeeded in getting stories into the media to promote the anti-Shchukin documentary. Sans Fronti\u00e8res says that it refused the demands. But emails show the firm did draw up an indicative price list, charging \u00a340,000 for a \u201cstory placement in a Tier 1 or national news publication in the UK\u201d and \u00a350,000 for any video featured in \u201ca Tier 1 broadcaster\u201d. Clips uploaded to YouTube were priced at \u00a35,000. The firm insists no payment was ever received and the project to promote the documentary never got off the ground. Then a murky story that had mutated from a quest for justice to one about black propaganda became murkier still. It transpired that some of the hacked emails were fake. Others contained false information. One such email purportedly showed an aide to Chris Bryant, the Labour MP who formerly chaired the all-party parliamentary group on Russia, organising an event to discuss what action the UK could take against Shchukin and Uzbekov. But no email was written. Scotland Yard is now investigating. Another email, purportedly sent by Liakhov, suggested that he, Bellingham and Ben Wallace, the then security minister, had participated in an \u201chour-long teleconference\u201d after which the cabinet had come to view the campaign against Uzbekov and his wife as \u201ca pilot project for using Unexplained Wealth Orders to cleanse the United Kingdom of unwanted residents\u201d. But no such teleconference took place. And there was no cabinet backing for the plan. \u201cWhile the motivation behind making these false claims is unclear, we are alive to the potential for disinformation to be used by powerful individuals, some countries and other sources to undermine confidence in the UK government and its policies,\u201d a Home Office spokeswoman said as the contents of the leaked emails found their way into newspapers, triggering fears that British parliamentarians were being targeted by Russians with close links to the Kremlin. Suddenly those behind the Blood Coal Money campaign were on the defensive, forced to answer questions about their true motives and their real source of funding. Claims that the grassroots campaign was crowdfunded on behalf of Siberian coalminers wanting justice for the Lazarevich family looked increasingly far-fetched, especially when it emerged its website had been registered by a London-based fixer with business links to Russia. At one stage, the Observer understands, the same fixer planned to hire a flashmob to protest outside Elena Shchukina\u2019s art gallery. There was also talk of daubing it in animal blood. When the Observer met Uzbekov in the exclusive Mayfair club Annabel\u2019s, his favoured London haunt where a wagu beef cheeseburger (without chips) costs \u00a328, he seemed sanguine about the campaign being conducted against him and his father-in-law. Uzbekov suggested it was being waged by an oligarch close to Putin and several other powerful Russian businessmen, including a former senior KGB officer. \u201cHit me with an Unexplained Wealth Order,\u201d Uzbekov shrugged. \u201cIt will be the shortest investigation in history.\u201d The true aim of the black propaganda campaign against him, his wife and his father-in-law, he suggested, was to wrest control of their family trust in Cyprus and its ownership of the Polosukhinskaya coalmine, a cash cow that produces earnings of $100m a year, paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes to the Russian authorities; all, he insisted, meticulously documented. The trust\u2019s creation was an insurance policy, codenamed French Fish, a play on Project Pike, said Uzbekov who travels around London in a bulletproof Range Rover and has filed complaints to the police in Cyprus, Monaco and London about attempts made on his life. \u201cIt was designed for two eventualities \u2013 Shchukin being arrested and Shchukin being killed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no shareholders in the trust.

      "body": "<p>For many people who have followed the career of Boris Johnson \u2013 EU diplomats past and present, as well as European officials and journalists \u2013 his return to Brussels on Thursday as prime minister, to proclaim a deal that would end the UK\u2019s EU membership, was not just an event of obvious historic importance.</p> <p>It also had an unreal quality \u2013 bringing a swirl of memories flooding back of how the \u201cBoris story\u201d had all begun in Brussels three decades before. As what was likely to be the last EU summit with the UK in the fold got under way in the early afternoon, many remarked how difficult it all was to process.</p> <p>Johnson, the ex-journalist and now the statesman, appeared next to European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, whose views he had mocked in newspaper columns and speeches since the late 1980s, the two now all smiles and best of friends. \u201cJean-Claude\u2019s the boss here,\u201d Johnson joked as they trumpeted their deal.</p> <p>The former foes congratulated one another on an arrangement that Johnson said would at last set the UK free to \u201ctake decisions about our laws, our borders and our money\u201d as an independent nation state. Juncker \u2013 the arch-enemy federalist in the eyes of Eurosceptics since the Maastricht treaty days of the early 1990s \u2013 followed up by saying he was happy at their joint success, but sad the UK was leaving. But he was also clear that this really was it.</p> <p>Doing Johnson a favour, he upped the ante on Westminster MPs by insisting there would be no further extension for the UK if the deal was voted down. \u201cThis deal means there is no need for any prolongation,\u201d Juncker declared. It was the Johnson deal or no deal.</p> <p>Like other EU politicians of longstanding, Juncker first came across Johnson when he was a young Brussels correspondent, making his name on the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. Then he was the journalistic bane of the commission and every true believer in the European project.</p> <p>As he watched the prime minister on Thursday, Geoff Meade, the former Press Association correspondent in Brussels who once worked alongside Johnson, recalled the numerous \u201cfanciful\u201d stories from Brussels that had appeared on the <em>Telegraph\u2019s </em>front page between 1989 and 1994, including one in 1991 about the commission having to be blown up because of dangerous asbestos. It was a Johnson exclusive, which he followed up with another about plans to replace the building with a giant skyscraper so high that planes would have to be diverted to avoid crashing into it.</p> <p>\u201cThere were more than a few people at the summit on Friday observing the scene and pondering the Johnson journey from sometimes hapless hack, peddling half-truths and fanciful interpretations of the deeds and motives of \u201cunelected Eurocrats\u201d to powerful PM, now leading a proud nation out of the European club on the back of EU paranoia he helped foster 30 years ago,\u201d said Meade.</p> <p>As he addressed journalists at just before 7pm on Thursday, having received the formal approval for the deal from the other 27 EU leaders, Johnson looked exhausted. Showing deference to the moment, he struck a sober, serious tone and chose an oddly constructed metaphor to describe \u201cexciting\u201d prospects ahead for the UK once it had left the EU. \u201cThe extraction having been done the building can now begin,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It had been a trying few days. The chief stumbling block all along had been the problem of the Irish border: how to satisfy Johnson\u2019s demand that the UK must leave the EU customs union while at the same time meeting the EU\u2019s and Irish red-line demands that there be nothing that could be construed as a hard border on the island of Ireland itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9bfe24e829dcec807071aecddbc8d549edf815b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bfe24e829dcec807071aecddbc8d549edf815b1/758_581_3947_2368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson in talks with Ireland\u2019s taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the grounds of Thornton Manor hotel near Birkenhead last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson in talks with Ireland\u2019s taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the grounds of Thornton Manor hotel near Birkenhead last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Dublin, London and Brussels, the nadir was reached last Tuesday, with the now notorious phone call between Johnson and Angela Merkel. The German chancellor rejected Johnson\u2019s plea to revive proposals that had already been rejected by Brussels. By the end of the call, Merkel is said to have become blunt, concluding that the Irish border left the UK with a major issue it could not wish away.</p> <p>Just as disastrous was the aggressive briefing of the call by Downing Street, whose officials said that it was a \u201cvery useful clarifying moment\u201d because it suggested a deal was \u201cessentially impossible, not just now but ever\u201d. That frustrated many in Brussels, who assumed the deal talks were over and the blame game had begun.</p> <p>In Ireland, there was also pessimism and dismay at \u201cthe tone that was coming out\u201d of No 10 by Tuesday night. It seemed impossible that a deal could be done in just a few days. Even as officials headed to a meeting between Johnson and Leo Varadkar at the neutral venue of Thornton Manor in the Wirral, hopes were not high.</p> <p>\u201cEven as we travelled to Liverpool, I\u2019m not sure any of us were feeling particularly hopeful and there was certainly no expectation that we would be going home that evening with something as positive as a pathway to a deal,\u201d said an official.</p> <p>Yet hopes began to rise when the meeting between the leaders, scheduled for 30 minutes, dragged on and on. So prolonged was the discussion and subsequent walk in the garden that their hungry teams began to worry about whether it would be OK to eat their sandwiches before their respective leaders had eaten anything.</p> <p>So what changed? \u201cI guess there was a reality to the discussions,\u201d said a diplomatic source. \u201cThis could work and this can\u2019t.\u201d In truth, the Wirral meeting had been the centrepiece of a wider diplomatic effort. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, had been in Brussels the evening before, clarifying what could and could not be accepted. There was a key conversation between the chancellor Sajid Javid and his Irish counterpart Paschal Donohoe on customs issues, which may have given a sense that the UK was prepared to make a move.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Varadkar\u2019s hard line that the only workable solution was for Northern Ireland to stay in a customs union with the EU had begun to change, almost imperceptibly. By the time he and Johnson met, some diplomatic sources said they believed the Irish leader\u2019s mind was shifting, and that he also had had word from the UK side that Johnson was ready to move too, and was looking for a possible landing zone for a deal.</p> <p>Wednesday opened with hopes raised but many contradictory messages. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had set an 11am deadline for a legal text on any new deal to be submitted but this deadline passed yet again with issues over the Irish border still unresolved.</p> <p>MPs were shuffling and out of Downing Street; Tory Eurosceptics, Labour, and DUP alike. All the while the clock was ticking. Johnson had to have a deal that could be agreed by parliament by 19 October or he would have to ask for a Brexit extension under the terms of the Benn act.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay appeared before a Commons select committee and said that the PM would write a letter in accordance with the legislation if no deal had been agreed by the deadline. But Downing Street was still suggesting that while Johnson would obey the law, the UK would leave on 31 October come what may. A senior Labour frontbencher said: \u201cIt\u2019s just games, more Johnson games.\u201d</p> <p>Both could not be true, but government officials would not say more. Johnson met his cabinet at 2.30pm on Wednesday but full details of the deal he was negotiating were not given because it had not been finalised and the legal text remained a work in progress between London and Brussels.</p> <p>At 4.30pm Johnson attended a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, but only stayed for 10 minutes saying it was \u201ctime to get Brexit done\u201d, and repeating Theresa May\u2019s mantra that it would be the deal on offer, or no deal. Afterwards, while there was growing optimism no one knew if a deal (whatever it would be) would gain the necessary support from the DUP, pro-deal Labour MPs, Tory hard Brexiters in the European Research Group, and former Tory Remainers who had lost the party whip to get it through parliament.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He would have loved being one of the principal actors, instead of one of the most irreverent reporters</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Gimson, biographer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Overnight, however, the DUP pre-empted Johnson\u2019s big moment \u2013 the announcement of a deal about which its leaders had been in talks with Downing Street for days. The landing zone Johnson had agreed with Varadkar would, to the DUP\u2019s dismay, involve a customs border in the Irish sea and an end to the DUP\u2019s veto over the future arrangements in the Stormont assembly. Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s leader at Westminster, said Johnson had put \u201cfar too much\u201d effort into getting a deal and far too little into ensuring it did not sell Northern Ireland down the river. The DUP would vote against the deal.</p> <p>At 9am before he set off for Brussels, Johnson made a decision to press ahead despite the DUP\u2019s objections. He was going for broke, ready to gamble on winning over enough Labour Leavers, independents and former Tory MPs to get it across the line in parliament. He called Juncker to finalise the deal before announcing it on Twitter.</p> <p>When he appeared with Juncker soon after, the commission president\u2019s insistence that there would be no extension came as a bolt from the blue. If that view was shared by the 27 EU leaders, it really would be the Johnson deal or no deal. Momentarily it seemed the tactical game was being won by Johnson and Downing Street.</p> <p>Quickly, however, it became clear that Juncker was merely lending his new ally Johnson short-term tactical support. In the leaders\u2019 Brexit discussions that followed, Merkel told Johnson that if the deal was rejected by the Commons, the EU would have to seriously consider an extension. It was the opposite of what Juncker had said. Delay was still possible. \u201cWhat matters is not what Juncker says but what the 27 leaders say,\u201d said an EU diplomat. Just as fast as some clarity and clear advantage to one side seemed to have emerged, the fog of doubt about where it was all going had descended again.</p> <p>At 5.30pm, Varadkar, the EU council president Donald Tusk, Barnier and Juncker appeared and declared the deal sealed. Tusk seemed weary and emotional, saying he hoped the UK would return one day. Varadkar likened the moment to bidding farewell to a dear old friend who was going on a long journey into the unknown, and hoping it would all turn out well. There was no repetition of Juncker\u2019s comments about no further extension.</p> <p>Minutes later Johnson appeared for his press conference, declaring he was \u201cvery confident\u201d he would have the numbers in parliament to get the deal through. He also suggested that more reassurance would be given to Labour and other MPs before Saturday\u2019s vote on issues such as workers rights and the environment. But he had not anticipated the successful move led by former Tory minister Oliver Letwin to force a further delay.</p> <p>Hopes of a deal that could pass through parliament have risen and fallen yet again \u2013 but as ever with Brexit, the final outcome is still unclear. Andrew Gimson, author of the biography <em>Boris: The Making of the Prime Minister,</em> said after observing the PM\u2019s appearance alongside EU leaders that despite the dramas and continuing uncertainties, Johnson would \u201chave loved being one of the principal actors, instead of, as he was three decades ago, one of the best known and most irreverent reporters\u201d even though he had yet to achieve the Brexit he had done so much \u2013 in his many different roles \u2013 to advance down the years.</p>",

It also means I am burdened by high expectations, because so far it has been a chorus of wet-lipped hallelujahs and aerated dribble for the concise menu of idiosyncratic dishes. Where Lyle\u2019s makes a point of Britishness, here they say they are looking deeper into Europe. We can all get behind that, right?</p> <p>The moment you crash through the door it becomes clear this really is an elbows-on-the-table sort of place, not least because there\u2019s nowhere else to put them. On the ground floor there is a high counter around an open kitchen and a few tiny tables at which to sit knee to knee. Waiters are mostly thin. At the back is a corkscrew of black painted metal spiral staircase, which must be a nightmare to negotiate in heels.</p> <p>It leads to another tight space of tiny tables and compact banquettes. The small tables are an issue because it is 2019. Therefore, you will not get something as banal as one plate each at a time. The food comes in whatever order the kitchen deigns, even if there isn\u2019t enough space to place the crockery. It\u2019s a clatter of dishes crammed together, which only adds to the sense of dissonance and discord.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf55ba84acd670fd9e1bcb1d2e89030d4441a940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf55ba84acd670fd9e1bcb1d2e89030d4441a940/0_314_4914_2948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lettuce with hazelnuts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A heap of salad with a thick brown satay-like dressing\u2019: lettuce with hazelnuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before anybody thinks I\u2019m about to be arsey for the sake of it, be in no doubt: they serve some very good food.

Wines from \u00a324 On the night Flor opened the doors to its sliver of a townhouse by London\u2019s Borough Market, one restaurant writer tweeted indignantly that he hadn\u2019t been able to get a table, despite the website\u2019s claim that they held back space for walk-ins. Well, doh! As Homer might have said in the restaurant critic episode of The Simpsons. Flor wasn\u2019t just any old opening. It wasn\u2019t some witty Peruvian-Greek small plates mashup utilising seasonal produce cooked over logs harvested from Peckham\u2019s Goose Green. It\u2019s the second restaurant from the team behind the high-flying, adored Lyle\u2019s, which has enough awards and citations to make Meryl Streep feel like an underachiever.

Yes, he was rich and powerful. Yes, he operated in that phoney realm (Hollywood) in which beauties and beasts are apt to go along with one another. And yes, as a producer of genius, he was protected as the goose that laid the golden eggs. Nevertheless, there were people around Weinstein, also rich and powerful, and liberal minded to boot, who knew what was going on. Why did no one speak out? Why did nothing concrete ever stick?</p> <p>Ronan Farrow\u2019s extraordinary <em>Catch and Kill</em>, in which he masterfully tells the story of his quest to reveal Weinstein\u2019s repugnant activities to the world, doesn\u2019t merely answer these questions. It makes them come to seem complacent, even profoundly stupid. Several times while reading it, I had the sense that, having been blind, I could now see \u2013 and for miles, too. But while this brought with it a certain bracing clarity, it hardly came as a relief. As some American critics have already observed, Farrow\u2019s narrative has the pace of a thriller. Were it really a thriller, however, the collusion at its heart would be too much: you would dismiss it as airport pulp. Here is a conspiracy so deeply embedded and far-reaching that even as I write, those alleged to be involved not only remain in their jobs; in recent days, they have pugnaciously denied all wrongdoing in the matter of the reporting of Weinstein\u2019s behaviour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The warmth \u2018drains out of the room\u2019 when Farrow mentions Weinstein\u2019s name</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Catch and Kill</em> follows the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/18/she-said-by-jodi-cantor-and-megan-twohey-weinstein\" title=\"\"><em>She Said</em> by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey</a>, the <em>New York Times</em> journalists with whom Farrow shared a Pulitzer prize for breaking the Weinstein story in 2017. The two books are, though, quite different. Farrow is just as tenacious as Kantor and Twohey; his work rate pushes him to exhaustion and his partner, Jonathan, to exasperation.</p> <p>But as the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, he is both <em>of</em> the world he describes <em>and</em> outside it (his sister Dylan has accused her father of having abused her as a child, allegations that Allen denies; Weinstein\u2019s company, Miramax, used to distribute Allen\u2019s films). If Farrow is in possession of an abundance of empathy \u2013 Weinstein\u2019s victims trust him and rightly so \u2013 he also has an ear for dialogue and a taste for drama. There is something amusingly self-conscious about the way, at one point, he places evidence in a safety deposit box. He\u2019s not being histrionic. Sinister operatives from an Israeli security company engaged by Weinstein are by now tailing him. Nevertheless, he doesn\u2019t pretend not to relish the moment (\u201cshould anything happen to me, please make sure this information is released\u201d).</p> <p>But back to that collusion. Farrow\u2019s book captures the terror and paranoia that eat away at Weinstein\u2019s victims for the simple reason that he comes to experience them himself, a human mirror. The producer\u2019s sphere of influence extends ever outwards, like the powerful arms of some giant squid. Will it pull Farrow under? No, but it will lead him to lose his job at NBC, where he is an investigative reporter. Again and again, his bosses at the network block his reporting on Weinstein. Why? For a long time, he can\u2019t work it out. Gradually, though, the fog lifts. What it amounts to, says Farrow, is this: <em>they are all in it together</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/18/she-said-by-jodi-cantor-and-megan-twohey-weinstein\">She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey review \u2013 the inside story of Weinstein and #MeToo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The eyes of Matt Lauer, the then presenter of NBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> show, \u201csnap back\u201d when Farrow reveals that he\u2019s working on a story about sexual harassment (in 2017, Lauer was fired by NBC following an allegation of sexual harassment by a co-worker; in <em>Catch and Kill</em>, Farrow states that the woman in question, Brooke Nevils, was in fact anally raped by Lauer, an allegation Lauer denies). The warmth \u201cdrains out\u201d of the room when Farrow mentions Weinstein\u2019s name to Tom Brokaw, the veteran news anchor; it turns out the two men are friends (in 2018, Brokaw, too, was accused of making unwanted advances towards women, allegations he denied).</p> <p>As an undergraduate, Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, wrote anti-feminist diatribes for the <em>Harvard Crimson</em> (one insisted that women enjoyed being \u201cpreyed upon\u201d) and it\u2019s to Oppenheim that (coincidentally?) Weinstein sends a bottle of Grey Goose vodka soon after he (Weinstein) hears that Farrow\u2019s investigation has been killed (Oppenheim tells Farrow, in the face of much evidence to the contrary, that he doesn\u2019t think he has a story; NBC\u2019s line now is that the story simply wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d). </p> <p>Phil Griffin, the president of NBC\u2019s political off-shoot MSNBC, is another of those who isn\u2019t too keen on Farrow\u2019s project. What kind of man is he? According to Farrow,<strong> </strong>the kind who waves around a photograph of a woman\u2019s vagina in a meeting and who once pressurised female producers to accompany him to a peep show. Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, allegedly has a history of hounding female employees. The day after Farrow meets David Corvo, a producer brought in to work with him, the network finalises a $1m agreement with a former NBC employee Corvo had pursued inappropriately (NBC has denied the payment was connected to such a complaint). In the period covered by the book, at least one of these men was in contact with Weinstein.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By the time Farrow pitches up at the New Yorker he cuts a lonely, desperate figure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I could go on. Hillary Clinton pulled out of an interview with Farrow following concerns about his reporting of Weinstein, a Democrat donor. The book also dishes on the activities of the <em>National Enquirer</em>, the work it did buying up and then burying negative stories (the \u201ccatch and kill\u201d technique of the title) about both Donald Trump and Weinstein, to whom its former editor-in-chief, Dylan Howard, was close. </p> <p>By the time Farrow pitches up at the <em>New Yorker</em>, having come to believe that his story will never air on NBC, he cuts a lonely, desperate figure, as isolated in his way as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Rose McGowan</a> or any of the other women Weinstein attempted to intimidate into silence. And no wonder. No matter that you are Ronan Farrow. No matter that your reporting will stand up to the rigours of the <em>New Yorker</em>\u2019s fact checkers.

      "bodyText": "Watching Ursula Macfarlane\u2019s mesmerising documentary about Harvey Weinstein last month, I found myself wondering again how he got away with his alleged crimes for so long. Yes, he was rich and powerful. Yes, he operated in that phoney realm (Hollywood) in which beauties and beasts are apt to go along with one another. And yes, as a producer of genius, he was protected as the goose that laid the golden eggs. Nevertheless, there were people around Weinstein, also rich and powerful, and liberal minded to boot, who knew what was going on. Why did no one speak out? Why did nothing concrete ever stick? Ronan Farrow\u2019s extraordinary Catch and Kill, in which he masterfully tells the story of his quest to reveal Weinstein\u2019s repugnant activities to the world, doesn\u2019t merely answer these questions. It makes them come to seem complacent, even profoundly stupid. Several times while reading it, I had the sense that, having been blind, I could now see \u2013 and for miles, too. But while this brought with it a certain bracing clarity, it hardly came as a relief. As some American critics have already observed, Farrow\u2019s narrative has the pace of a thriller. Were it really a thriller, however, the collusion at its heart would be too much: you would dismiss it as airport pulp. Here is a conspiracy so deeply embedded and far-reaching that even as I write, those alleged to be involved not only remain in their jobs; in recent days, they have pugnaciously denied all wrongdoing in the matter of the reporting of Weinstein\u2019s behaviour. Catch and Kill follows the publication of She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times journalists with whom Farrow shared a Pulitzer prize for breaking the Weinstein story in 2017. The two books are, though, quite different. Farrow is just as tenacious as Kantor and Twohey; his work rate pushes him to exhaustion and his partner, Jonathan, to exasperation. But as the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, he is both of the world he describes and outside it (his sister Dylan has accused her father of having abused her as a child, allegations that Allen denies; Weinstein\u2019s company, Miramax, used to distribute Allen\u2019s films). If Farrow is in possession of an abundance of empathy \u2013 Weinstein\u2019s victims trust him and rightly so \u2013 he also has an ear for dialogue and a taste for drama. There is something amusingly self-conscious about the way, at one point, he places evidence in a safety deposit box. He\u2019s not being histrionic. Sinister operatives from an Israeli security company engaged by Weinstein are by now tailing him. Nevertheless, he doesn\u2019t pretend not to relish the moment (\u201cshould anything happen to me, please make sure this information is released\u201d). But back to that collusion. Farrow\u2019s book captures the terror and paranoia that eat away at Weinstein\u2019s victims for the simple reason that he comes to experience them himself, a human mirror. The producer\u2019s sphere of influence extends ever outwards, like the powerful arms of some giant squid. Will it pull Farrow under? No, but it will lead him to lose his job at NBC, where he is an investigative reporter. Again and again, his bosses at the network block his reporting on Weinstein. Why? For a long time, he can\u2019t work it out. Gradually, though, the fog lifts. What it amounts to, says Farrow, is this: they are all in it together. The eyes of Matt Lauer, the then presenter of NBC\u2019s Today show, \u201csnap back\u201d when Farrow reveals that he\u2019s working on a story about sexual harassment (in 2017, Lauer was fired by NBC following an allegation of sexual harassment by a co-worker; in Catch and Kill, Farrow states that the woman in question, Brooke Nevils, was in fact anally raped by Lauer, an allegation Lauer denies). The warmth \u201cdrains out\u201d of the room when Farrow mentions Weinstein\u2019s name to Tom Brokaw, the veteran news anchor; it turns out the two men are friends (in 2018, Brokaw, too, was accused of making unwanted advances towards women, allegations he denied). As an undergraduate, Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, wrote anti-feminist diatribes for the Harvard Crimson (one insisted that women enjoyed being \u201cpreyed upon\u201d) and it\u2019s to Oppenheim that (coincidentally?) Weinstein sends a bottle of Grey Goose vodka soon after he (Weinstein) hears that Farrow\u2019s investigation has been killed (Oppenheim tells Farrow, in the face of much evidence to the contrary, that he doesn\u2019t think he has a story; NBC\u2019s line now is that the story simply wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d). Phil Griffin, the president of NBC\u2019s political off-shoot MSNBC, is another of those who isn\u2019t too keen on Farrow\u2019s project. What kind of man is he? According to Farrow, the kind who waves around a photograph of a woman\u2019s vagina in a meeting and who once pressurised female producers to accompany him to a peep show. Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, allegedly has a history of hounding female employees. The day after Farrow meets David Corvo, a producer brought in to work with him, the network finalises a $1m agreement with a former NBC employee Corvo had pursued inappropriately (NBC has denied the payment was connected to such a complaint). In the period covered by the book, at least one of these men was in contact with Weinstein. I could go on. Hillary Clinton pulled out of an interview with Farrow following concerns about his reporting of Weinstein, a Democrat donor. The book also dishes on the activities of the National Enquirer, the work it did buying up and then burying negative stories (the \u201ccatch and kill\u201d technique of the title) about both Donald Trump and Weinstein, to whom its former editor-in-chief, Dylan Howard, was close. By the time Farrow pitches up at the New Yorker, having come to believe that his story will never air on NBC, he cuts a lonely, desperate figure, as isolated in his way as Rose McGowan or any of the other women Weinstein attempted to intimidate into silence. And no wonder. No matter that you are Ronan Farrow. No matter that your reporting will stand up to the rigours of the New Yorker\u2019s fact checkers. These are all powerful people and they can do a man, or a woman, real harm. Not that it\u2019s over, even now. In recent days, all manner of weasel statements and legal threats have emanated from those named by Farrow. That he is determinedly standing by his book \u2013 that he\u2019s standing at all \u2013 is the only chink of light in this for me. These stinking structures. They hold now and they will hold in the future. When NBC, whose job it is to tell America about itself, reports on Weinstein\u2019s trial in January, women from Washington to Wisconsin will ask themselves what has been left out; they will wonder who did the edit and how and why. Meanwhile, women elsewhere will turn their minds to their own institutions. What else is there still to find out? Who is keeping quiet and about what?

It is, honestly, as good as everybody\u2019s telling you.</p> <p>The chief shining is being done so far by virtue of the two main police partners in this particular murder squad actually liking each other, shock. Cassie (Sarah Greene) and Rob (Killian Scott) actually get on, sharing just-so dark humour and cheeky nips from a flask on harbour walls in 2006, when the Celtic Tiger was still all agleam with hubristic promise of gimcrack dockside flats. It\u2019s a rare thing, to see such onscreen chemistry, the chemistry of strong, flawed friendship, probably last witnessed between Cormoran and Robin in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/24/strike-electric-dreams-doc-martin-review-jk-rowling\" title=\"\"><em>Strike</em></a>.</p> <p>The key word there was \u201cflawed\u201d: Rob Reilly is hugely compromised. Having been (it soon transpires) the child victim of unexplained savagery in 1985, he\u2019s arguably the last murder-squad body on Earth who should be investigating another missing kid. Cassie\u2019s also got her secrets; chiefly a buried stint undercover. By the third episode, a truly novel, exceptionally inspired, twist on the concept of \u201cundercover identity\u201d will emerge.</p> <p>There are intermittent shocks throughout this triumphant eight-part adaptation (two episodes a week), by Sarah Phelps, of Tana French\u2019s bestselling Dublin Murder Squad crime novel series. There are the usual ones \u2013 ravens, ravening; weird things found weirdly in woods; a pig-sexist boss \u2013 but one of the most unsettling we encounter is Scott, in the shower, in a life-or-death struggle to uncrick his neck.</p> <p>No less terrifically human is Greene. Few others aside from perhaps Vera Stanhope could pull off her soft words over a dead child: \u201cOh sweetheart\u2026 your little face\u201d.</p> <p>One sizable trap was that, yes, yawn, the first body found was that of a 13-year-old girl, found in the woods on an ancient stone altar (the second that of a pretty, half-naked student) and I wonder when writers will grow weary. (At least the writers here are female.) Also, when a young girl disappears, even in 2006, it\u2019s kind of <em>a big thing</em>. The last one I covered was in Soham (2002), and I can still recall vividly the international media caravanserai haring late that hot Saturday to RAF Lakenheath, then filing on the run at 5.40 and having too many slow hours after my burbled cliches to reflect on the true enormity. In Knocknaree, there\u2019s only one local reporter/photographer. All I\u2019m trying to say is: this sort of thing really, and thankfully, is not that common. Personal quibbles apart, it\u2019s still a winner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52a5baf05aedb933c91e761af9672f4f646a1d67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a5baf05aedb933c91e761af9672f4f646a1d67/99_0_4213_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Rudd and Paul Rudd in Living With Yourself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Something of a tour de force\u2019: Paul Rudd and\u2026 Paul Rudd in Living With Yourself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80178724\" title=\"\"><strong>Living With Yourself</strong></a> is something of a tour de force for Paul Rudd.

And, of course, original boy wakes alive in grave, shakes shit from hair, walks eight miles in rain to join clone in pass-agg fight for career, wife, own life. Etc.</p> <p>Much, perforce, goes on, yet nothing feels hurried. At first sight it\u2019s like an old Hollywood double-identity romcom, albeit with very good, very modern humour: truly funny, often. Yet Aisling Bea, as Miles\u2019s wife Kate \u2013 in fact both Mileses\u2019 wife Kate \u2013 is no wifely cipher. As this series gallops onward, it becomes clear that Kate\u2019s going to have to choose between loser Miles and Miles 2.0: and there are big, big existential questions raised about authenticity versus (perceived) perfection. Truly, one for both old-Hollwyood aficionados and, pertinently, the selfie, Instagram age.

      "bodyText": "Dublin Murders BBC One | iPlayer Living With Yourself Netflix Giri/Haji BBC Two | iPlayer Succession Sky Atlantic/Now TV Why We Hate Discovery UK Are Our Politicians Up to It?: The Debate Channel 5 Dublin Murders fell into a few traps, but rolled away from all of them, bloodily nicked but unbowed, to rise tall above ditches, below that grey perma-sky, and shine. It is, honestly, as good as everybody\u2019s telling you. The chief shining is being done so far by virtue of the two main police partners in this particular murder squad actually liking each other, shock. Cassie (Sarah Greene) and Rob (Killian Scott) actually get on, sharing just-so dark humour and cheeky nips from a flask on harbour walls in 2006, when the Celtic Tiger was still all agleam with hubristic promise of gimcrack dockside flats. It\u2019s a rare thing, to see such onscreen chemistry, the chemistry of strong, flawed friendship, probably last witnessed between Cormoran and Robin in Strike. The key word there was \u201cflawed\u201d: Rob Reilly is hugely compromised. Having been (it soon transpires) the child victim of unexplained savagery in 1985, he\u2019s arguably the last murder-squad body on Earth who should be investigating another missing kid. Cassie\u2019s also got her secrets; chiefly a buried stint undercover. By the third episode, a truly novel, exceptionally inspired, twist on the concept of \u201cundercover identity\u201d will emerge. There are intermittent shocks throughout this triumphant eight-part adaptation (two episodes a week), by Sarah Phelps, of Tana French\u2019s bestselling Dublin Murder Squad crime novel series. There are the usual ones \u2013 ravens, ravening; weird things found weirdly in woods; a pig-sexist boss \u2013 but one of the most unsettling we encounter is Scott, in the shower, in a life-or-death struggle to uncrick his neck. No less terrifically human is Greene. Few others aside from perhaps Vera Stanhope could pull off her soft words over a dead child: \u201cOh sweetheart\u2026 your little face\u201d. One sizable trap was that, yes, yawn, the first body found was that of a 13-year-old girl, found in the woods on an ancient stone altar (the second that of a pretty, half-naked student) and I wonder when writers will grow weary. (At least the writers here are female.) Also, when a young girl disappears, even in 2006, it\u2019s kind of a big thing. The last one I covered was in Soham (2002), and I can still recall vividly the international media caravanserai haring late that hot Saturday to RAF Lakenheath, then filing on the run at 5.40 and having too many slow hours after my burbled cliches to reflect on the true enormity. In Knocknaree, there\u2019s only one local reporter/photographer. All I\u2019m trying to say is: this sort of thing really, and thankfully, is not that common. Personal quibbles apart, it\u2019s still a winner. Living With Yourself is something of a tour de force for Paul Rudd. It\u2019s the age-worn story of boy marries girl, boy becomes ground down by weary failures in lifelovework etc, boy clones self in dodgy Korean Top Happy Spa for $50k, happy best-he-can-be clone saunters home to impress wife, boss etc with newfound joie de vivre. And, of course, original boy wakes alive in grave, shakes shit from hair, walks eight miles in rain to join clone in pass-agg fight for career, wife, own life. Etc. Much, perforce, goes on, yet nothing feels hurried. At first sight it\u2019s like an old Hollywood double-identity romcom, albeit with very good, very modern humour: truly funny, often. Yet Aisling Bea, as Miles\u2019s wife Kate \u2013 in fact both Mileses\u2019 wife Kate \u2013 is no wifely cipher. As this series gallops onward, it becomes clear that Kate\u2019s going to have to choose between loser Miles and Miles 2.0: and there are big, big existential questions raised about authenticity versus (perceived) perfection. Truly, one for both old-Hollwyood aficionados and, pertinently, the selfie, Instagram age. I loved pretty much every moment, and all performances (Bea has been quite the find this summer): roll on more seasons. Giri/Haji is an immensely promising thriller set between Tokyo and London, and with a fine lead in Takehiro Hira as Kenzo Mori, a (compromised, obviously) detective on a quest in the UK capital. It\u2019s violent, uncompromising and squirrelly, and Kenzo will, despite his corseted persona, find redemption in the outliers: rent boy Rodney (Will Sharpe), douce Sarah (Kelly Macdonald). The stylish anime flashbacks are a welcome addition to primetime drama. Succession ended with a gleeful setup for the third series. It was only afterwards that the downside struck: I\u2019ll have months to wait before hearing, again, Nicholas Britell\u2019s joyful and menacing theme music, arguably the song of the summer.

Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.\u201d He continued: \u201cInstead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually New York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with proper management.\u201d The American then says that within \u201cno more than 25 years\u201d the fisherman could announce an IPO and sell his company stock to the public and \u201cmake millions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMillions, se\u00f1or?

Funny how a fictional fisherman and a grandpa I can\u2019t remember the name of have helped me to spend more time with my family <em>today</em>, instead of the elusive someday. And do you know what? The deep relationships I\u2019ve developed with my wife and four children over the years and our many shared experiences together mean more to me than all the money in the world.</p> <p>It would surprise the me of yesterday to hear, but to the me of today, the amount of meaningful time one spends with his family each day is the ultimate measure of success.</p>",

The fisherman then explains that he uses all his extra time so he can \u201csleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos\u201d. \u201cSir, I\u2019m a Harvard MBA and can help you,\u201d the American responds. \u201cYou should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.\u201d He continued: \u201cInstead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually New York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with proper management.\u201d The American then says that within \u201cno more than 25 years\u201d the fisherman could announce an IPO and sell his company stock to the public and \u201cmake millions\u201d. \u201cMillions, se\u00f1or? Then what?\u201d The fisherman asks. The American concludes: \u201cThen you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.\u201d The lesson of this story redefined how I saw my dual roles of parent and provider. Funny how a fictional fisherman and a grandpa I can\u2019t remember the name of have helped me to spend more time with my family today, instead of the elusive someday. And do you know what? The deep relationships I\u2019ve developed with my wife and four children over the years and our many shared experiences together mean more to me than all the money in the world. It would surprise the me of yesterday to hear, but to the me of today, the amount of meaningful time one spends with his family each day is the ultimate measure of success.",

Now, after reading the speech, Anderson believes the attorney general, in revealing his devotion to an especially conservative branch of Catholicism, is a \u201cthreat to American democracy\u201d.</p> <p>He described the speech as a \u201cdog whistle\u201d to ultra-conservative Catholics who, he says, have aligned themselves to Donald Trump in a campaign to limit the rights of LGBTQ Americans, immigrants and non-Christians, especially Muslims, and to criminalize almost all abortions. \u201cThe attorney general is taking positions that are essentially un-Democratic\u201d because they demolish the wall between church and state, Anderson said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/25/death-penalty-capital-punishment-us-justice-department-resumes-executions\">US justice department resumes use of death penalty and schedules five executions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the hallways of the justice department in Washington, there has been a similar furor among some Catholics employees who answer to Barr. \u201cI was shocked by the speech and all this fire and brimstone,\u201d said a senior department career official who considers himself a devout Catholic, speaking on condition that he not be identified for fear of losing his job.</p> <p>\u201cAt least it helps me understand why Barr has been so willing to put his own reputation on the line to defend Trump so fiercely in every battle,\u201d beginning with the congressional investigation that is likely to end in the president\u2019s impeachment, he said. \u201cTrump is Barr\u2019s imperfect vessel in serving a much higher cause: the gospel.\u201d</p> <p>In the speech, delivered to an invitation-only crowd at Notre Dame, one of the nation\u2019s largest and best known Catholic universities, the attorney general described threats to religious freedom.</p> <p>He warned that Catholicism and other mainstream religions were the target of \u201corganized destruction\u201d by \u201csecularists and their allies among progressives who have marshalled all the force of mass communications, popular culture, the entertainment industry and academia\u201d.</p> <p>He insisted that \u201cthe traditional Judeo-Christian moral system\u201d of the United States was under siege by \u201cmodern secularists\u201d who were responsible for every sort of \u201csocial pathology\u201d, including drug abuse, rising suicide rates and illegitimacy.</p> <p>Barr did not address the fact that many of the policies of the Trump administration are strongly opposed by the Vatican. Pope Francis has repeatedly pleaded for the United States to open its doors to more refugees, even as Barr has defended policies that turn away or imprison immigrants seeking refugee status at the US-Mexico border, even separating parents from their children.</p> <p>The reaction to Barr\u2019s address came as another Trump cabinet member, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, was drawing fire from civil liberties groups over the state department\u2019s decision this week to promote his recent speech titled Being a Christian Leader on the department\u2019s online homepage.</p> <p>The speech by Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, was delivered on Friday, the same day as Barr\u2019s speech, to a meeting of the American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine for secretary Pompeo to be a leader who is a Christian,\u201d the group Americans United for Separation of Church and State said in a statement. But the decision to promote Pompeo\u2019s speech on the department\u2019s official website sends \u201cthe clear message that US public policy will be guided by his personal religious beliefs\u201d.</p> <p>Barr\u2019s speech at Notre Dame was a reminder of a fact often overlooked in analysis of Trump\u2019s political base \u2013 that while the president enjoys the support of many high-profile right-wing Christian evangelical leaders, he has also surrounded himself with conservative Roman Catholics associated with organizations that some others in the faith consider extreme.</p> <p>One example: Barr and Patrick Cipollone, Trump\u2019s White House counsel, have both served on the board of directors of a Washington-based organization staffed by priests from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/quite-a-shock-the-priest-was-a-dc-luminary-then-he-had-a-disturbing-fall-from-grace/2019/01/14/99b48700-1453-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html\">secretive, ultra-orthodox Catholic sect Opus Dei</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffe01d1b7d2dc508ba8faab1975daa6c1f978309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffe01d1b7d2dc508ba8faab1975daa6c1f978309/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Barr departs the annual Red Mass at the Cathedral of St Matthew the Apostle in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Barr departs the annual Red Mass at the Cathedral of St Matthew the Apostle in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Silbiger/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barr\u2019s speech last week was hailed by many conservative religious commentators. \u201cBarr took the gloves off, saying that religion is not jumping to its death; it\u2019s being pushed,\u201d wrote Ron Dreher at the American Conservative magazine.</p> <p>\u201cAs we religious conservatives think about how to vote in the election next fall, we should ponder the fact that under Donald Trump, as awful as he is in so many ways, a man of William Barr\u2019s convictions is heading up the Department of Justice,\u201d Dreher continued. \u201cThank God Bill Barr is there.\u201d</p> <p>Liberal Catholics, on the other hand, said they were dumbfounded at Barr\u2019s willingness to so publicly link his Catholicism to his work at the justice department.</p> <p>\u201cThis should put the fear of God into anybody who cares about freedom, democracy and the separation of religion and politics,\u201d said Jon O\u2019Brien, president of Catholics for Choice, a group that advocates for Catholics who support a woman\u2019s right to abortion and other reproductive freedoms.</p> <p>Barr\u2019s speech, he said, shows that \u201cChristmas is coming very early\u201d for conservative Catholics and other Christians who want to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/24/abortion-wars-alabama-12-hours-besieged-clinic\">an end to abortion rights</a>.</p> <p>In his Notre Dame speech, Barr spoke of the need for the United States to recognize \u201cnatural law\u201d, a concept in Catholic theology that has been cited by the Vatican in recent decades to try to outlaw artificial contraception and medical procedures such as in vitro fertilization.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien said he worried that under Barr, who was sworn in last February, that the justice department could impose a de facto litmus test on federal judicial candidates, requiring them to commit themselves to \u201cnatural law\u201d.</p> <p>Anderson, the Fordham theologian, said he was so alarmed by the tone of Barr\u2019s speech that he was now concerned the attorney general intends to use his authority to put the United States on the path of increasingly authoritarian European nations like Poland, where democratically government leaders have cited their devout Catholicism to justify a crackdown on free speech and the purging of judges.</p> <p>That Barr is a devout, conservative Catholic is no surprise to anyone who has studied his writings and speeches.

One example: Barr and Patrick Cipollone, Trump\u2019s White House counsel, have both served on the board of directors of a Washington-based organization staffed by priests from the secretive, ultra-orthodox Catholic sect Opus Dei. Barr\u2019s speech last week was hailed by many conservative religious commentators. \u201cBarr took the gloves off, saying that religion is not jumping to its death; it\u2019s being pushed,\u201d wrote Ron Dreher at the American Conservative magazine. \u201cAs we religious conservatives think about how to vote in the election next fall, we should ponder the fact that under Donald Trump, as awful as he is in so many ways, a man of William Barr\u2019s convictions is heading up the Department of Justice,\u201d Dreher continued. \u201cThank God Bill Barr is there.\u201d Liberal Catholics, on the other hand, said they were dumbfounded at Barr\u2019s willingness to so publicly link his Catholicism to his work at the justice department. \u201cThis should put the fear of God into anybody who cares about freedom, democracy and the separation of religion and politics,\u201d said Jon O\u2019Brien, president of Catholics for Choice, a group that advocates for Catholics who support a woman\u2019s right to abortion and other reproductive freedoms. Barr\u2019s speech, he said, shows that \u201cChristmas is coming very early\u201d for conservative Catholics and other Christians who want to see an end to abortion rights. In his Notre Dame speech, Barr spoke of the need for the United States to recognize \u201cnatural law\u201d, a concept in Catholic theology that has been cited by the Vatican in recent decades to try to outlaw artificial contraception and medical procedures such as in vitro fertilization.

A week later, Barr\u2019s speech at Notre Dame remains the subject of \u201ca lot of chatter\u201d on campus, said professor David Campbell, chairman of the university\u2019s political science department.

Similarly, it has taken a decade for the British economy to recover from the banking crisis of 2007-09 \u2013 and, indeed, it is begging the question to assume that the recovery is complete. Far from it. As is being increasingly recognised, recovery was stifled by an ill-conceived austerity programme whose deleterious effects played no small role in the outcome of the 2016 referendum. The economic and social damage has been such that what the country requires is a government with the imagination and determination of the post-1945 Attlee government. In which context, the independent National Institute of Economic and Social Research is to be congratulated for its imminent publication of Beyond Brexit: A Programme for UK Reform, a product of the newly formed Policy Reform Group. Edited by the economists John Llewellyn and Russell Jones (of Llewellyn Consulting) the work draws on contributions from many eminent economists and public figures on the future of economic, industrial and foreign policy, \u201caddressing the challenges facing the country regardless of what particular form of exit from the EU will ultimately be chosen\u201d. Regular readers will guess where this last sentence leads me. There is now abundant evidence that no form of Brexit would be chosen by any sane administration, and many of us \u2013 as is clear from public demonstrations \u2013 have not yet given up hope that in the end the best Brexit is indeed no Brexit.

The fact of the matter is, as recognised by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and the authors of Beyond Brexit: a satisfactory programme of UK reform requires an honest recognition that taxes will be required to pay for it.

One of the many farcical, and deeply reprehensible, aspects of this whole business is the way Brexiter ministers have been repeating the blatant lie that a deal such as that Johnson negotiated last week involves \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d.

Back in the day, this modern epidemic was limited to insomniacs and new mothers. I can remember lacking a decent snooze for so long that I understood why sleep deprivation was used as a form of torture. Nowadays, everyone is functioning on little sleep. Arguably, it\u2019s because we are all so \u2018busy\u2019. Busyness has become a status symbol for our age. We are always \u2018on\u2019 and it\u2019s becoming impossible to switch off. And that\u2019s why our cortisol levels (the stress-producing hormone) are through the roof. For better sleep, the experts recommend removing electronic devices from the bedroom, exercising during the day and managing your circadian rhythm \u2013 the body\u2019s internal clock \u2013 by reducing our exposure to bright lights at least three hours before bed. I\u2019ll add another tip. Get yourself a \u2018sleep mist\u2019. I know, it sounds ridiculous and a bit basic, but it really helps. This one has blended essential oils \u2013 neroli, chamomile, lavender and geranium, all known for their sleep-enhancing properties \u2013 in a distilled flower water concoction. Half an hour before bed I go to town and spray it everywhere for good measure. Sleep comes quick and goes deep. I wake up feeling human as opposed to a half-functioning 21st-century bastion of busyness. <em>Aurelia Probiotic Skincare Perfect Sleep Pillow Mist, <strong>\u00a324</strong> <a href=\"https://www.aureliaskincare.com/\">aureliaskincare.com</a></em></p> <h2>On my radar\u2026 creams, oils and liquids to restore and replenish</h2> <p><strong>Age is no barrier </strong>Using base oils of prickly pear and rosehip, this intense oil blends jasmine, sandalwood and ginger lily with fatty acids to nourish and decongest.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has sent an unsigned letter to European council president Donald Tusk requesting a further Brexit delay beyond 31 October \u2013 accompanied by a signed one arguing against it. The prime minister sent a total of three letters: an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn Act, an explanatory letter from the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU and a personal letter explaining why Downing Street did not want an extension. In the signed message, he warned of the \u201ccorrosive impact\u201d of a long delay, and that \u201ca further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us\u201d. He said Parliament had \u201cmissed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process\u201d yet remained confident Brexit legislation would be passed by 31 October. The move sparked concerns the prime minister could face fresh court action. One former Tory cabinet minister said: \u201cThis is clearly against the spirit of the Benn Act and is not consistent with the assurances that were given by Downing Street to the Scottish courts about applying for an extension. It will also put government law officers in a very uncomfortable position.\u201d The late-night letters followed another bruising day in the Commons for Johnson, where MPs voted by 322 to 306 to withhold approval of his EU exit deal, forcing him to write to Brussels by 11pm on Saturday to request an extension until 31 January 2020. Despite the prime minister\u2019s insistence that he would not \u201cnegotiate\u201d a further extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, he confirmed on Saturday evening that he had sought such a prolongation. Shortly after 10pm London time, Tusk tweeted: \u201cThe extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\u201d An EU source said Tusk\u2019s deliberations with European leaders \u201cmay take a few days\u201d. After the extension request was sent, Jeremy Corbyn accused Johnson of \u201cpetulant posturing and bluster\u201d and said \u201chis damaging deal was defeated today.\u201d Officials in Brussels said there was little doubt that an extension request would be granted, despite the prime minister\u2019s attempts to throw doubt on such a move. A decision on the terms could be taken later in October to allow for events to unfold in London. A summit could be held as late as 29 October. Ambassadors for the EU27 will meet on Sunday morning to discuss the latest developments. Speaking in the Commons earlier, Johnson told MPs he did not believe the EU would be minded to offer a further extension and that he would not negotiate one. But senior EU officials said it was clear during the discussions among the leaders at a summit on Thursday that they would grant an extension. \u201cEven [the French president Emmanuel] Macron in the room didn\u2019t suggest otherwise,\u201d the source said. The chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who is a senior member of German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d an extension would be granted. A consequence of the delay to the Brexit deal being approved in parliament is that the European parliament\u2019s plans to ratify the withdrawal agreement next week have also been left in doubt. The European parliament will ratify the deal only after the Commons has approved it. MEPs next sit on 14 November, making 30 November a potential new Brexit day if the Commons approves the deal by then. Guy Verhofstadt, the coordinator of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said his committee would \u201cconsider the outcome of today\u2019s vote for the Letwin amendment on Monday\u201d. He added: \u201cWhatever happens next, the marches outside the parliament show just how important a close EU-UK future relationship is.\u201d Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, told the Guardian that Brussels would not \u201cwait and see\u201d but that \u201cif asked\u201d the leaders would \u201csay yes\u201d. The Commons voted on Saturday that it would not approve the Brexit deal until all related legislation was passed. MPs were concerned that the legislation would not be passed by 31 October, leaving open the possibility of the UK accidentally crashing out. That decision triggered the Benn act which placed the prime minister under a legal obligation to request an extension unless a deal had been approved by 11pm UK time on Saturday. On Friday, Macron had tried to help Johnson cajole MPs into backing his deal by suggesting that he was opposed to a delay. \u201cI am not trying to read into the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay,\u201d he had said. A spokesman for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said that any further delay \u201cwas not in anyone\u2019s interest\u201d. But EU sources said the private comments of Merkel better represented the leaders\u2019 position. She had told EU leaders that a Brexit extension would be unavoidable if British MPs vote down the new deal. Merkel said leaders had a responsibility not to push the UK out without a deal.",

Patman, a 24-term congressman, once asked Arthur Burns, the Fed chair appointed by Richard Nixon: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/\">Can you give me any reason why you should not be in the penitentiary</a>?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stoller strafes targets across political and ideological spectrums</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stoller, a former staffer to Bernie Sanders on the Senate budget committee and sometime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matt-stoller\">Guardian contributor</a>, is now a <a href=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org/staff/matt-stoller/\">fellow</a> at the Open Markets Institute, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/george-soros-foundation-big-tech-e51afe27-3511-4b13-9f2b-fa3857989f1f.html\">a George Soros-funded thinktank</a> dedicated to challenging Silicon Valley\u2019s titans. Stoller delivers a beat-down to Amazon, Google and Facebook as the new monopolists, arguing that concentrated economic power threatens democracy.</p> <p>As he sees it, antitrust policy is a vehicle for \u201cpreserving democracy within the commercial sphere, by keeping markets open\u201d. For New Deal populists like Patman and the former supreme court justice Louis Brandeis, \u201cit was democracy or concentrated wealth \u2013 but not both\u201d.</p> <p>Stoller strafes targets across political and ideological spectrums. In 600-plus pages, he attacks John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter, mid-20th-century liberal academics and icons, for their approval of concentrated economic power.</p> <p>Goliath turns its guns on the McGovern-Fraser Commission, formed by Democrats in the aftermath of their 1968 loss to Nixon. In particular, Stoller vents spleen on the late <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/27/politics/frederick-dutton-adviser-to-the-kennedys-and-the-saudis-is-dead-at.html\">Frederick Dutton</a>, Robert Kennedy\u2019s campaign manager who set the template for the Democrats\u2019 upstairs-downstairs playbook and was later a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Specifically, Stoller blames Dutton\u2019s efforts \u201cto eject the white working class\u201d from the party \u201cin true Galbraithian form\u201d. As Stoller sees it, the Democrats never fully recovered. By the numbers, Trump owes his election and the Republican party its survival to white working-class disaffection from what once was the party of FDR.</p> <p>Goliath also does a deep-dive on the rise of what has become known as the Chicago School and market conservatism. Stoller recalls how Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan\u2019s failed supreme court nominee and antitrust guru, played a key role in furnishing intellectual cover to those who opposed civil rights legislation.</p> <p>In 1963, when Jim Crow was still in full force, Bork branded what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u201clegislation by which the morals of the majority are self-righteously imposed upon a minority\u201d. Bork complained that the law \u201cwould force businessmen to \u2018deal with and serve persons with whom they do not wish to associate\u2019\u201d. Imagine that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, Goliath comes up short in addressing the intersection between culture and economics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stoller\u2019s shout-outs are eclectic. He comments favorably on proposals to restrain big tech by two conservatives, Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House judiciary committee, and Senator Josh Hawley, formerly attorney general of Missouri.</p> <p>He also calls for the break-up of Amazon, Facebook and Google, to counter the threat he believes they pose to democracy. Like them or not, the three do own our most personal secrets. Our data is their property and profit.</p> <p>Based on the 2016 election, Stoller may be on to something. Zuckerberg stood idly by as Cambridge Analytica pilfered the personal data of Facebook users. Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, calls Facebook an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisinsilico/status/1183814322881024000\">\u201calt-right collaborator\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "Wall Street is scared. Elizabeth Warren has surged to the front of the Democratic pack and some of the party\u2019s biggest donors are threatening to close their wallets or worse: donate to Donald Trump. Michael Bloomberg ponders jumping into a race against her. Mark Zuckerberg vows to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d if President Warren attempts to bust up Facebook. The Massachusetts senator\u2019s plan to gut private health insurance is understandably unpopular. But her calls for higher taxes on the wealthy have met with some approval, her demand that big tech be broken up parallels sentiments expressed by several conservatives, and her criticism of the financial industry engenders pushback from big banks and their allies. Into the fray jumps Matt Stoller, with a book subtitled The 100-Year War Between Monopoly and Democracy, in which Stoller traces the rise and decline of vigorous antitrust enforcement, attacks neoliberalism and gives pride of place to Wright Patman, the late Texas populist who chaired the House banking committee. Patman, a 24-term congressman, once asked Arthur Burns, the Fed chair appointed by Richard Nixon: \u201cCan you give me any reason why you should not be in the penitentiary?\u201d Stoller, a former staffer to Bernie Sanders on the Senate budget committee and sometime Guardian contributor, is now a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a George Soros-funded thinktank dedicated to challenging Silicon Valley\u2019s titans. Stoller delivers a beat-down to Amazon, Google and Facebook as the new monopolists, arguing that concentrated economic power threatens democracy. As he sees it, antitrust policy is a vehicle for \u201cpreserving democracy within the commercial sphere, by keeping markets open\u201d. For New Deal populists like Patman and the former supreme court justice Louis Brandeis, \u201cit was democracy or concentrated wealth \u2013 but not both\u201d. Stoller strafes targets across political and ideological spectrums. In 600-plus pages, he attacks John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter, mid-20th-century liberal academics and icons, for their approval of concentrated economic power. Goliath turns its guns on the McGovern-Fraser Commission, formed by Democrats in the aftermath of their 1968 loss to Nixon. In particular, Stoller vents spleen on the late Frederick Dutton, Robert Kennedy\u2019s campaign manager who set the template for the Democrats\u2019 upstairs-downstairs playbook and was later a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia. Specifically, Stoller blames Dutton\u2019s efforts \u201cto eject the white working class\u201d from the party \u201cin true Galbraithian form\u201d. As Stoller sees it, the Democrats never fully recovered. By the numbers, Trump owes his election and the Republican party its survival to white working-class disaffection from what once was the party of FDR. Goliath also does a deep-dive on the rise of what has become known as the Chicago School and market conservatism. Stoller recalls how Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan\u2019s failed supreme court nominee and antitrust guru, played a key role in furnishing intellectual cover to those who opposed civil rights legislation. In 1963, when Jim Crow was still in full force, Bork branded what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u201clegislation by which the morals of the majority are self-righteously imposed upon a minority\u201d. Bork complained that the law \u201cwould force businessmen to \u2018deal with and serve persons with whom they do not wish to associate\u2019\u201d. Imagine that. Stoller\u2019s shout-outs are eclectic. He comments favorably on proposals to restrain big tech by two conservatives, Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House judiciary committee, and Senator Josh Hawley, formerly attorney general of Missouri. He also calls for the break-up of Amazon, Facebook and Google, to counter the threat he believes they pose to democracy. Like them or not, the three do own our most personal secrets. Our data is their property and profit. Based on the 2016 election, Stoller may be on to something. Zuckerberg stood idly by as Cambridge Analytica pilfered the personal data of Facebook users. Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, calls Facebook an \u201calt-right collaborator\u201d. It sure seems that way. Not surprisingly, Facebook has seen its reputation crash. Worse, it is no longer cool. Younger Americans have fled to other social media platforms. As for Amazon, it poses a greater challenge to Stoller and indeed to Trump. Consumers really like it. Jeff Bezos\u2019s brainchild allows people to shop from the comfort of their homes, something chain stores, a Stoller b\u00eate noire, never did. Beyond that, Amazon helps keeps prices low and competitive. In an era of income stagnation outside the upper reaches of the wealth pyramid, Amazon has made a difference. To be sure, it has also been destructive, leaving mom-and-pop retail stores shuttered and vacant mall space aplenty. Unfortunately, Goliath comes up short in addressing the intersection between culture and economics. In 1972, Senator George McGovern, the Democrats\u2019 nominee, came to be known as the candidate of \u201camnesty, acid and abortion\u201d \u2013 and was mowed down by an incumbent Nixon. McGovern\u2019s redistributive economics coupled with unvarnished social liberalism and foreign policy dovishness managed to alienate organized labor, a Democratic mainstay. Like Warren, McGovern took on a former vice-president, Hubert Humphrey \u2013 another Stoller hero. The South Dakota senator won a battle, but lost the war. Taking a page out of McGovern\u2019s playbook, Warren now seeks to impose a wealth tax as she veers left on culture and itches to stick it to the middle class. By the time 2020 is done, Warren may be known as McGovern 2.0. In so many ways. Expect to hear more from Stoller as the campaign heats up. US manufacturing is in a Trump-tariff induced recession, retail sales are down and inequality grows. Although the president\u2019s ballyhooed tax cuts delivered for the GOP donor base and the Fortune 500, for the rest, not so much.

But she might equally have been referring to two other projects, one in London and one in New York, in which the African American artists Kara Walker and Kehinde Wiley have produced sculptures on a heroic scale. Like Bagwell, both give greater visibility to the historically overlooked and challenge the legitimacy of some we have honored in the past. Public art has long been used to exalt the powerful without counting the cost of their power. On a grand scale, Edwin Lutyens\u2019 design for New Delhi commemorated the exploitative Raj by emulating the capitals of ancient empires, ornate fountains and sculptural monuments the conspicuous totems of prestige. It was the same in London, Paris and Cape Town, in Washington and other American cities. Circles and squares were consecrated with allegorical memorials. Skilled craftsmanship and exceptional artistry made some of history\u2019s most murderous vandals and unworthy sovereigns into marble saints.

      "body": "<p>Your report gave a compelling account of the effects of part of Britain\u2019s housing crisis (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/profits-from-poverty-britains-housing-scandal-providers-make-millions\" title=\"\">Housing the homeless: private profits, public squalor</a>\u201d, Special report). Even more hair-raising stories can be told about street or \u201csurfing\u201d homelessness, though perhaps of slightly lower numbers. Poor or no housing has an obvious effect on health and on children\u2019s educational prospects.</p> <p>A real reform of housing would have transformational effects on most major aspects of life, especially the NHS and schools. In his Queen\u2019s speech, the prime minister said that people \u201cwant their NHS to be stronger, their streets safer, their wifi faster, the air they breathe cleaner, their kids\u2019 schools better funded\u201d. There was no mention of housing. A new housing regulator is to be created but my guess is that it would be captured by the big housing firms (building and renting) within five minutes of inception. A Conservative government will bow to whatever the lobby wants, and George Osborne famously said that building more social housing just creates more Labour voters.</p> <p>What is extraordinary, however, is that Labour seems barely more enthusiastic. The Labour policy document on housing is entirely unconvincing and lacking in any clear statement of aim. This ought to be to house every citizen decently by the end of the first Labour parliament, full stop. <br><strong>Jeremy Cushing</strong><br>Taddyforde, Exeter<br></p> <p>It is pointless to blame private companies for exploiting people needing homes; the problems have been building for decades, ever since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cright-to-buy\u201d policy gave away millions of decent homes, more than a third of which are now owned by, you guessed it, private companies. The 13 wasted years of New Labour failed to change even that mad policy.</p> <p>So here we are, after decades of successive governments\u2019 failure to act, with a dysfunctional housing market. Despite thousands of flats in the dozens of \u201ccash boxes in the sky\u201d across London, homelessness is at its highest level for decades. Almost every family has been hit by the fact that even the cheapest flats in London are beyond the reach of even highly paid workers: a two-bed flat costing about 20 times the average salary!</p> <p>Local authorities have done little to change things. Here in Camden, north-west London, a solid Labour council has allowed several appalling developments with almost no affordable accommodation, despite a policy requiring half of any major new housing to do so. We need government actions to control the basic issues, but local government has a role.</p> <p>As most metropolitan districts are Labour controlled, surely they can coordinate to force this government to stop cutting their budgets, which is having impacts on every aspect of their duties, including the provision of affordable homes? Then we might see some progress towards a society in which everyone has a decent place to live.<br><strong>David Reed</strong><br>London NW3<br></p> <h2>Grenfell victims still waiting<br></h2> <p>The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, proclaims that \u201cwe must never see a tragic incident like the fire at Grenfell Tower happen again\u2019\u2019 (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/grenfell-tower-law-compels-owners-to-keep-buildings-safe\" title=\"\">Grenfell Tower law and NHS will be at the heart of domestic agenda in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d</a>, News). It is now over two years since Jenrick\u2019s predecessor, Sajid Javid, promised on national television that his government would \u2018\u2019do whatever it takes\u2019\u2019 to provide redress for the disaster\u2019s victims and survivors.</p> <p>So why are so many of the victims and their families still forced to go on waiting for the homes and other support that they need?<br><strong>Francis Prideaux</strong><br>London W9<br></p> <h2>Beyond Extinction Rebellion<br></h2> <p>Professor Lucy Robinson says that \u201cdifferent approaches \u2013 mass arrests, blockades, citizens\u2019 assemblies, carnivals \u2013 are all ways to imagine a different world\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/climate-protests-roots-deep-rich-history-british-social-change\" title=\"\">Climate protests have roots that go deep into the rich history of British social change</a>\u201d, Comment). But let\u2019s not get carried away. Extinction Rebellion is a necessary, but not sufficient, step on the path to a better future. In the end, it remains a single-issue movement.</p> <p>XR is necessary because its strategy and tactics are a refreshing, well-designed fit between ends and means, based on research about what might actually work. It is designed to create a different zeitgeist. It chooses to do this by non-violent direct action. XR shows us that non-violence is a strategic choice, not just a tactic, and is opening up many exiting new possibilities. Many XR supporters (me included) want a lot more social change than that. But, and it\u2019s a big but, XR isn\u2019t designed to do that. Alternative politics needs a rejection of party and hard work to build inclusive institutions that don\u2019t yet exist. This may even be a tougher challenge than the climate emergency the rebellion is successfully highlighting.<br><strong>Brian Fish</strong><br>Chapel Allerton, Leeds<br></p> <h2>The art of noise<br></h2> <p>The art of cinema projection as a skilled profession has been dying since the evolution of the multiplex and replacement of celluloid film by digital formats (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/cinema-noise-levels-ruining-films-joker-hugh-grant\" title=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s loud, actually\u2019: fans back Hugh Grant over cinema decibels</a>\u201d, News). As \u201cold-school\u201d projectionists, my colleagues and I would, in practice, always play films at a much lower level than that recommended by Dolby. Additionally, if the soundtrack mix made the spoken word inaudible, we would cheat the sound processor by lowering the levels on the surround sound amplifiers, creating the effect of increasing the speech levels through the front speakers.</p> <p>Discussing \u201csafe\u201d levels is to miss the point. No one would set the picture focus using anything other than their eyes, so why slavishly follow recommended levels and set the sound using anything other than the human ear? Hugh Grant was correct: if he felt that the audio level was uncomfortably loud, then it was and the film should have been played at a lower level.<br><strong>John Kirk</strong><br>Clifton, Otley<br>North Yorks<br></p> <h2>Tolerance is alive in Scotland<br></h2> <p>I completely agree with Stan Labovitch about the tragedy of Europeans feeling unwelcome in Britain (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/only-one-way-out-of-brexit-letters\" title=\"\">Letters</a>).

      "bodyText": "Your report gave a compelling account of the effects of part of Britain\u2019s housing crisis (\u201cHousing the homeless: private profits, public squalor\u201d, Special report). Even more hair-raising stories can be told about street or \u201csurfing\u201d homelessness, though perhaps of slightly lower numbers. Poor or no housing has an obvious effect on health and on children\u2019s educational prospects. A real reform of housing would have transformational effects on most major aspects of life, especially the NHS and schools. In his Queen\u2019s speech, the prime minister said that people \u201cwant their NHS to be stronger, their streets safer, their wifi faster, the air they breathe cleaner, their kids\u2019 schools better funded\u201d. There was no mention of housing. A new housing regulator is to be created but my guess is that it would be captured by the big housing firms (building and renting) within five minutes of inception. A Conservative government will bow to whatever the lobby wants, and George Osborne famously said that building more social housing just creates more Labour voters. What is extraordinary, however, is that Labour seems barely more enthusiastic. The Labour policy document on housing is entirely unconvincing and lacking in any clear statement of aim. This ought to be to house every citizen decently by the end of the first Labour parliament, full stop. Jeremy Cushing Taddyforde, Exeter It is pointless to blame private companies for exploiting people needing homes; the problems have been building for decades, ever since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cright-to-buy\u201d policy gave away millions of decent homes, more than a third of which are now owned by, you guessed it, private companies. The 13 wasted years of New Labour failed to change even that mad policy. So here we are, after decades of successive governments\u2019 failure to act, with a dysfunctional housing market. Despite thousands of flats in the dozens of \u201ccash boxes in the sky\u201d across London, homelessness is at its highest level for decades. Almost every family has been hit by the fact that even the cheapest flats in London are beyond the reach of even highly paid workers: a two-bed flat costing about 20 times the average salary! Local authorities have done little to change things. Here in Camden, north-west London, a solid Labour council has allowed several appalling developments with almost no affordable accommodation, despite a policy requiring half of any major new housing to do so. We need government actions to control the basic issues, but local government has a role. As most metropolitan districts are Labour controlled, surely they can coordinate to force this government to stop cutting their budgets, which is having impacts on every aspect of their duties, including the provision of affordable homes? Then we might see some progress towards a society in which everyone has a decent place to live. David Reed London NW3 Grenfell victims still waiting The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, proclaims that \u201cwe must never see a tragic incident like the fire at Grenfell Tower happen again\u2019\u2019 (\u201cGrenfell Tower law and NHS will be at the heart of domestic agenda in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d, News). It is now over two years since Jenrick\u2019s predecessor, Sajid Javid, promised on national television that his government would \u2018\u2019do whatever it takes\u2019\u2019 to provide redress for the disaster\u2019s victims and survivors. So why are so many of the victims and their families still forced to go on waiting for the homes and other support that they need? Francis Prideaux London W9 Beyond Extinction Rebellion Professor Lucy Robinson says that \u201cdifferent approaches \u2013 mass arrests, blockades, citizens\u2019 assemblies, carnivals \u2013 are all ways to imagine a different world\u201d (\u201cClimate protests have roots that go deep into the rich history of British social change\u201d, Comment). But let\u2019s not get carried away. Extinction Rebellion is a necessary, but not sufficient, step on the path to a better future. In the end, it remains a single-issue movement. XR is necessary because its strategy and tactics are a refreshing, well-designed fit between ends and means, based on research about what might actually work. It is designed to create a different zeitgeist. It chooses to do this by non-violent direct action. XR shows us that non-violence is a strategic choice, not just a tactic, and is opening up many exiting new possibilities. Many XR supporters (me included) want a lot more social change than that. But, and it\u2019s a big but, XR isn\u2019t designed to do that. Alternative politics needs a rejection of party and hard work to build inclusive institutions that don\u2019t yet exist. This may even be a tougher challenge than the climate emergency the rebellion is successfully highlighting. Brian Fish Chapel Allerton, Leeds The art of noise The art of cinema projection as a skilled profession has been dying since the evolution of the multiplex and replacement of celluloid film by digital formats (\u201c\u2018It\u2019s loud, actually\u2019: fans back Hugh Grant over cinema decibels\u201d, News). As \u201cold-school\u201d projectionists, my colleagues and I would, in practice, always play films at a much lower level than that recommended by Dolby. Additionally, if the soundtrack mix made the spoken word inaudible, we would cheat the sound processor by lowering the levels on the surround sound amplifiers, creating the effect of increasing the speech levels through the front speakers. Discussing \u201csafe\u201d levels is to miss the point. No one would set the picture focus using anything other than their eyes, so why slavishly follow recommended levels and set the sound using anything other than the human ear? Hugh Grant was correct: if he felt that the audio level was uncomfortably loud, then it was and the film should have been played at a lower level. John Kirk Clifton, Otley North Yorks Tolerance is alive in Scotland I completely agree with Stan Labovitch about the tragedy of Europeans feeling unwelcome in Britain (Letters). However, while this may be the case in England, it is not quite such a problem in Scotland. Remember, we voted 62-38 to remain and this is one of the reasons that the idea of independence is becoming more attractive to many Scots. The necessity of remaining within the EU and being part of something bigger, rather than a northern satellite of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage\u2019s Little England, seems a much more appealing long-term prospect to many people. One wonders why two countries that are so close to one another can be so far apart politically and culturally. Dougie Mitchell Edinburgh So much for loyalty In his review of Leo McKinstry\u2019s book, Attlee and Churchill: Allies in War, Adversaries in Peace, (New Review), Andrew Rawnsley states that, while \u201cTory intriguers schemed to replace Churchill, Attlee was staunchly loyal\u201d. And how was that loyalty repaid? In the first radio broadcast of the postwar election, on 4 June 1945, Churchill informed listeners that, if the Labour party won, Britain \u201cwould have to fall back on some form of Gestapo, no doubt very humanely directed in the first instance\u201d. Of course, Labour won by a landslide, but I don\u2019t think there were many goose-stepping policemen on our streets afterwards. Jack Critchlow Torquay, Devon",

He continued to defend his treatment of the Kurds, who sought help from Russia-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.</p> \n<p>\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of sand. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Kurds, he said several times, were \u201cnot angels\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump also wrote a letter for the ages to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d it said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will \u2026 Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d</p> \n<p>At first, no one could quite believe it was real. But it was. Commentators likened it to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdwardGLuce/status/1184574196413796352?s=20\">the writing of a juvenile</a> and suggesting Trump\u2019s grasp of foreign policy was barely more sophisticated.</p> \n<p>Brad Simpson, an associate professor at the University of Connecticut, tweeted: \u201cI am a historian of US foreign policy. I have read many, many letters from US presidents to foreign leaders, and I have never read a letter from the US president so unhinged, so threatening, so bizarre, so completely lacking in basic etiquette. Trump is deeply, deeply unwell.\u201d</p> \n<p>As if to prove the point, Trump sat with congressional leaders in the cabinet room and derided his former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d. Mattis later shot back: \u201cHe also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals.\u201d He told Pelosi, per her <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/4fd1feb8a5f0403993fa1e4669758c7b\">account</a>, \u201cYou are a third-grade politician.\u201d But it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-meeting-photo-meltdown-battle\">was a photograph of her,</a> a lone woman, standing and rebuking him that will endure.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,\u201d she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Mitt Romney</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>On Thursday, the nightmarish torrent continued as the vice-president, Mike Pence, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, brokered a five-day ceasefire in Turkey which was criticised for giving Erdo\u011fan everything he wanted. Trump, meanwhile, cut the ribbon at the opening of a new Louis Vuitton <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2019/10/18/trump-visit-brings-the-world-to-new-louis-vuitton-workshop-in-johnson-county/\">factory in Alvarado</a>, describing the French luxury brand as \u201ca name I know very well. It cost me a lot of money over the years.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later, speaking at a campaign rally in Dallas, he likened Turkey and the Kurds to children scrapping on a playground.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was unconventional what I did,\u201d he boasted, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/trump-presidency.html\">using a word that defines his political career.</a> \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids. Then you pull them apart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back in Washington, where the House of Representatives had voted overwhelmingly to condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria, there was a landmark critique from the Senate floor. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-block-senate-vote-on-resolution-condemning-trumps-decision-on-syria/2019/10/17/5ad3f9ca-f103-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html\">Mitt Romney of Utah said:</a> \u201cWhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles \u2013 that the United States stands with our allies.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the White House, there was a rare press briefing. Astonishingly, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine-quid-pro-quo\">there was indeed a quid pro quo with Ukraine,</a> telling reporters the administration held up aid to pressure the country to investigate whether it had helped Democrats in 2016.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have news for everybody: get over it,\u201d he said, brazenly driving a coach and horses through Trump\u2019s own denials. \u201cThere is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Realising he had shot himself \u2013 and his boss \u2013 in the foot, Mulvaney retracted his statement a couple of hours later and tried to blame the media. But his sincerity seemed doubtful when the Trump re-election campaign began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the legend: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-mick-mulvaney-get-over-it-t-shirt_n_5daa0f07e4b0422422c4966d\">\u201cGet over it.\u201d</a> The \u201co\u201d even had Trump\u2019s peculiar blond hair.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45f55d4639ca2ed9ab0beb6768afced8cc303ad0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45f55d4639ca2ed9ab0beb6768afced8cc303ad0/0_11_2322_1393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stands and speaks during a meeting at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stands and speaks during a meeting at the White House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: White House/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cIt does not help when you have Mr Mulvaney stand at the podium and say, \u2018Oh yeah, we do all quid pro quos all the time in foreign policy,\u2019 and then put out a statement because he realised he\u2019d screwed it up for the president.\u201d</p> \n<p>Steele reflected: \u201cWhen you take this week and look at the totality of the storylines and narratives that emerged, my analysis leads me to believe that what the president is doing is reacting to a tightening of events around him.

He announced that Trump would host next year\u2019s G7 summit at his own Doral resort in Florida.

      "bodyText": "On his 1,000th day as president, Barack Obama flew to North Carolina to launch a bus tour through smaller communities, selling a jobs act he hoped to get through Congress. Those were the days of politics as usual. Donald Trump spent his 1,000th day seemingly hellbent on self-immolation. The 45th president was busy on Wednesday, and the rest of this week, strengthening the case for his own impeachment, with a notable assist from his acting chief of staff. If the old rumours are true \u2013 that Trump never wanted to win election, that he would be happier on the golf course, that he is secretly looking for a way out \u2013 it is hard to imagine what more he could have done to bring it about. \u201cIt was appalling and counter-productive,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist. \u201cYou have support for impeachment rising, you have the White House admitting impeachable acts in public and you the president holding rallies where he\u2019s out of control. I think the country\u2019s getting tired of it.\u201d For critics, this was the week when Trump finally destroyed America\u2019s reputation abroad, committed the most flagrant ethics violation yet to benefit his own business, lost another cabinet member, got outplayed by his old foe Nancy Pelosi yet again and wrote the most embarrassingly puerile letter to a foreign leader in living memory. The context was two self-inflicted wounds of conflict in the Middle East and the impeachment inquiry at home. The situation in northern Syria was rapidly deteriorating after Trump ordered the withdrawal of the US military, widely seen as a callous abandonment of Kurdish allies and the worst foreign policy blunder since the Iraq war. Washington remained gripped by House Democrats\u2019 investigation, sparked by Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival. The week brought a steady drip of damaging revelations from current and former diplomats and officials behind closed doors. Among them was Fiona Hill, former top Russia adviser at the White House, who reportedly told the inquiry her boss, the then national security adviser, John Bolton, compared efforts to strong-arm Ukraine to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and described Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everyone up\u201d. If future historians dig up day 1,000 of the craziest show on earth as a time capsule of the Trump presidency, they will not be disappointed. He continued to defend his treatment of the Kurds, who sought help from Russia-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. \u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of sand. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d The Kurds, he said several times, were \u201cnot angels\u201d. Trump also wrote a letter for the ages to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d it said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will \u2026 Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d At first, no one could quite believe it was real. But it was. Commentators likened it to the writing of a juvenile and suggesting Trump\u2019s grasp of foreign policy was barely more sophisticated. Brad Simpson, an associate professor at the University of Connecticut, tweeted: \u201cI am a historian of US foreign policy. I have read many, many letters from US presidents to foreign leaders, and I have never read a letter from the US president so unhinged, so threatening, so bizarre, so completely lacking in basic etiquette. Trump is deeply, deeply unwell.\u201d As if to prove the point, Trump sat with congressional leaders in the cabinet room and derided his former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d. Mattis later shot back: \u201cHe also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals.\u201d He told Pelosi, per her account, \u201cYou are a third-grade politician.\u201d But it was a photograph of her, a lone woman, standing and rebuking him that will endure. \u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,\u201d she said. On Thursday, the nightmarish torrent continued as the vice-president, Mike Pence, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, brokered a five-day ceasefire in Turkey which was criticised for giving Erdo\u011fan everything he wanted. Trump, meanwhile, cut the ribbon at the opening of a new Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, describing the French luxury brand as \u201ca name I know very well. It cost me a lot of money over the years.\u201d Later, speaking at a campaign rally in Dallas, he likened Turkey and the Kurds to children scrapping on a playground. \u201cIt was unconventional what I did,\u201d he boasted, using a word that defines his political career. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids. Then you pull them apart.\u201d Back in Washington, where the House of Representatives had voted overwhelmingly to condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria, there was a landmark critique from the Senate floor. Mitt Romney of Utah said: \u201cWhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles \u2013 that the United States stands with our allies.\u201d At the White House, there was a rare press briefing. Astonishingly, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confessed there was indeed a quid pro quo with Ukraine, telling reporters the administration held up aid to pressure the country to investigate whether it had helped Democrats in 2016. \u201cI have news for everybody: get over it,\u201d he said, brazenly driving a coach and horses through Trump\u2019s own denials. \u201cThere is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d Realising he had shot himself \u2013 and his boss \u2013 in the foot, Mulvaney retracted his statement a couple of hours later and tried to blame the media. But his sincerity seemed doubtful when the Trump re-election campaign began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the legend: \u201cGet over it.\u201d The \u201co\u201d even had Trump\u2019s peculiar blond hair. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cIt does not help when you have Mr Mulvaney stand at the podium and say, \u2018Oh yeah, we do all quid pro quos all the time in foreign policy,\u2019 and then put out a statement because he realised he\u2019d screwed it up for the president.\u201d Steele reflected: \u201cWhen you take this week and look at the totality of the storylines and narratives that emerged, my analysis leads me to believe that what the president is doing is reacting to a tightening of events around him. They are closing in on him from so many directions at the same time that there is no way out.\u201d Yet Mulvaney had another surprise. He announced that Trump would host next year\u2019s G7 summit at his own Doral resort in Florida. Following widespread anger and disbelief, the president made a rare and humiliating climbdown on Saturday night, tweeting that the decision had been reversed, \u201cbased on both media &amp; Democrat crazed and irrational hostility\u201d, and he would seek an alternative venue. All this \u2026 and Rick Perry too. The energy secretary, who had been drawn into the Ukraine scandal, told Trump that he would quit the cabinet \u2013 crowning a thousand days of turmoil that have seen record White House turnover. By then, Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony felt like a lifetime ago and Washington was crying for mercy and a rest. But there were reports from Syria of Turkish mortar fire breaking the ceasefire. Trump said he had just spoken to Erdo\u011fan and \u201cthere\u2019s a ceasefire, or a pause, or whatever you want to call it\u201d. The coming weeks are likely to bring only more turmoil on the road to impeachment, to be followed by a trial in the Senate as Trump tests his conception of absolute authority to destruction. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Rhode Island, said: \u201cThis is the man who said he could shoot someone in the middle of Manhattan and get away with it. \u201cHe believes the president is all powerful and can get away with anything. The House is saying there should be constraints on a president and that is resonating with the people. He\u2019s pushing the envelope because he\u2019s pushing it for his whole presidency.

The person\u2019s mind and memories, emotions and personality would be duplicated. In effect, a new and equally valid version of that person would now exist, in a potentially immortal, digital form. This futuristic possibility is called mind uploading. The science of the brain and of consciousness increasingly suggests that mind uploading is possible \u2013 there are no laws of physics to prevent it. The technology is likely to be far in our future; it may be centuries before the details are fully worked out \u2013 and yet given how much interest and effort is already directed towards that goal, mind uploading seems inevitable. Of course we can\u2019t be certain how it might affect our culture but as the technology of simulation and artificial neural networks shapes up, we can guess what that mind uploading future might be like.</p> <p>Suppose one day you go into an uploading clinic to have your brain scanned. Let\u2019s be generous and pretend the technology works perfectly. It\u2019s been tested and debugged. It captures all your synapses in sufficient detail to recreate your unique mind.

      "bodyText": "Imagine that a person\u2019s brain could be scanned in great detail and recreated in a computer simulation. The person\u2019s mind and memories, emotions and personality would be duplicated. In effect, a new and equally valid version of that person would now exist, in a potentially immortal, digital form. This futuristic possibility is called mind uploading. The science of the brain and of consciousness increasingly suggests that mind uploading is possible \u2013 there are no laws of physics to prevent it. The technology is likely to be far in our future; it may be centuries before the details are fully worked out \u2013 and yet given how much interest and effort is already directed towards that goal, mind uploading seems inevitable. Of course we can\u2019t be certain how it might affect our culture but as the technology of simulation and artificial neural networks shapes up, we can guess what that mind uploading future might be like. Suppose one day you go into an uploading clinic to have your brain scanned. Let\u2019s be generous and pretend the technology works perfectly. It\u2019s been tested and debugged. It captures all your synapses in sufficient detail to recreate your unique mind. It gives that mind a standard-issue, virtual body that\u2019s reasonably comfortable, with your face and voice attached, in a virtual environment like a high-quality video game. Let\u2019s pretend all of this has come true. Who is that second you? The first you, let\u2019s call it the biological you, has paid a fortune for the procedure. And yet you walk out of the clinic just as mortal as when you walked in. You\u2019re still a biological being, and eventually you\u2019ll die. As you drive home, you think: \u201cWell, that was a waste of money.\u201d At the same time, the simulated you wakes up in a virtual apartment and feels like the same old you. It has a continuity of experience. It remembers walking into the clinic, swiping a credit card, signing a waiver, lying on the table. It feels as though it was anaesthetised and then woke up again somewhere else. It has your memories, your personality, your thought patterns and emotional quirks. It sits up in a new bed and says: \u201cI can\u2019t believe it worked! Definitely worth the cost.\u201d I won\u2019t call it an \u201cit\u201d any more, because that mind is a version of you. We\u2019ll call it the simulated you. This \u201csim\u201d you decides to explore. You step out of your apartment into the sunlight of a perfect day and find a virtual version of New York City. Sounds, smells, sights, people, the feel of the sidewalk underfoot, everything is present \u2013 with less garbage though, and the rats are entirely sanitary and put in for local colour. You chat up strangers in a way you would never do in the real New York, where you\u2019d be worried that an impatient pedestrian might punch you in the teeth. Here, you can\u2019t be injured because your virtual body can\u2019t break. You stop at a cafe and sip a latte. It doesn\u2019t taste right.

      "body": "<p>The second album from <a href=\"https://floatingpoints.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Floating Points</a> \u2013 Manchester-born producer Sam Shepherd \u2013 is immediately visceral. Shepherd is a neuroscientist, and his sound has often been more cerebral and delicate than that of his UK electronic music peers (he first emerged at the peak of dubstep and breakbeat).

Launched in full last Wednesday, the 10-part series tells the true story of a group of young men who dug a tunnel from West Berlin to East Berlin in the early 1960s, under the Berlin Wall, and used it to smuggle people out. The Beeb had a big party for the podcast launch, which offered a live Q&amp;A with the podcast\u2019s presenter-producer, Helena Merriman, and one of the tunnellers, plus the chance to enjoy an \u201cimmersive experience\u201d. A short, non-muddy bit of tunnel-crawling, I imagine. I don\u2019t know; I didn\u2019t go.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t attend the party because I get a bit put off by Big BBC Podcast Launches. They load the poor podcast with such high expectations that, as a listener, you\u2019re almost bound to be disappointed. Think of all the fuss and flannel around <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/26/13-minutes-to-moon-kevin-pietersen-beast-man-where-this-service-will-review\" title=\"\">13 Minutes to the Moon</a></em> earlier this year: fuss that meant that the series, which was OK, but not brilliant, was a letdown. And what about <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06hmv8c\" title=\"\">The Ratline</a></em>, the second series in the Radio 4 Intrigue podcast strand (<em>Tunnel 29</em> is the third)? That, like <em>13 Minutes</em>, was both massively hyped and badly produced, with weird editing decisions leading to a confusing narrative. <em>The Ratline</em> had the feel of too many executives poking over the script. It was a great story, let down by bad storytelling.</p> <p><em>Tunnel 29</em>, I\u2019m happy to say, is wildly better. This is mostly to do with Merriman, whose scriptwriting and delivery are sure-handed and clear, with nary a whiff of cheese. Not for her the BBC cliches of going on a journey, of unnecessary how-I-made-this-podcast detail, of awkward this-is-me-feeling-stuff chat, of foreshadowing and over-explanation.</p> <p>Instead, Merriman is confident. She tells the story, which is a good one, a real Le Carr\u00e9-style cold war yarn, in a positive manner, with proper forward motion. She\u2019s happy, as she says, to \u201cfreeze the action\u201d when needed, leaving one set of characters doing their thing, while visiting others in the story. She reminds us who is who; she explains without patronising. She leaves us wanting more; each episode is only as long as it needs to be (between 15 and 30 minutes).</p> <p>Merriman\u2019s clarity and detailed reporting is enhanced by some wonderful soundscaping by Eloise Whitmore. We hear muttered voices, clanking axes, the click of an old-fashioned gun. We sense the claustrophobia of the tunnel (Whitmore recorded in there). Music swells and retreats as needed; the end of each episode is played out by Tom Rosenthal\u2019s How This Came to Be, or, sometimes, Keep Me Warm. (Merriman researched and chose all the music herself.)</p> <p>The series itself is an engaging tale that shifts, around episodes six and seven, into something really thrilling. There are many unexpected elements to the tunnel escape \u2013 an American TV crew, a walkabout girlfriend \u2013 and the whole series is given real jeopardy by the presence of a Stasi mole and by the Stasi itself, the GDR security service so terrifyingly good at its job that its interrogation officers didn\u2019t need to use force. Congratulations to Merriman, who clearly kept all the meddlers well away: <em>Tunnel 29</em> is both a Big BBC Podcast and a really great listen. Don\u2019t believe the hype, just enjoy it for yourself.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lovely moment in <em>Tunnel 29</em> when an East German describes the first time he tastes pineapple marmalade; his lip-smacking delight reminded me of how lax I can be about reviewing food series. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I love food \u2013 I\u2019m just not quite into it enough to listen to programmes about it.</p> <p>But for those who are interested, I feel I should mention the World Service\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p028z2z0\" title=\"\">The Food Chain</a></strong>.

      "bodyText": "Australian music legend Bon Scott will get the epic tribute he deserves in March, when 10km of Perth\u2019s Canning Highway will be closed for eight hours to host the world\u2019s longest music festival stage: a roving concert, rolling from one end to another, devoted to AC/DC covers. On 1 March 2020, 10 semi-trailers \u2013 eight topped with live bands playing AC/DC songs \u2013 will be taking over the highway\u2019s southern portion, between Canning Bridge and Fremantle: the same regular pilgrimage Scott would make in his youth, heading from his Fremantle home to rock\u2019n\u2019roll hangout the Raffles hotel. The stretch of highway was immortalised in 1979\u2019s Highway to Hell, nicknamed for the fatal crashes that plagued its most dangerous intersection. But the event itself \u2013 which was announced on Sunday \u2013 is as much a tribute to the film clip of an earlier AC/DC hit, It\u2019s A Long Way To The Top, which featured the band playing on the back of a flatbed truck as it drove through Swanston Street, Melbourne. For the concert \u2013 which marks the 40th anniversary of the singer\u2019s death, and closes the 2020 Perth arts festival \u2013 two lanes of the stretch will be devoted to the \u201chit parade\u201d of local and international acts, moving at 4km/h with regular stops. The other two lanes will be for the public, who will set up picnic rugs and vantage spots to watch the bands. Four other parks and stops along the route will be devoted to special events, including a mass singalong of Highway to Hell, and rock patch-making sessions with the local embroiderers\u2019 guild. 2020 marks the first of four Perth festivals to be helmed by new artistic director Iain Grandage, an internationally renowned music director and composer who was born and raised in Perth.

      "bodyText": "The federal attorney general, Christian Porter, maintains he would be \u201cseriously disinclined\u201d to sign off on the criminal prosecution of journalists for public interest journalism, but added he cannot give any guarantees. \u201cI can\u2019t, though, give anything more definitive than that, because my role in this process is to assess a brief that may or may not come up, and a recommendation that may or may not come up, to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t even get to that point until the AFP had concluded their investigation and delivered a brief, if they were minded, a brief to the DPP for their consideration. \u201cSo I can\u2019t abide by the law and give a definitive view without seeing what may be the evidence, if it even reaches that point. \u201cBut the fundamental point is that investigations, whether they be of any Australian, are conducted by the AFP, completely arm\u2019s length from government, as it should be, but these are extra safeguards put in place in that process.\u201d Earlier this year, the AFP raided the home of the News Corp political editor, Annika Smethurst, and the Sydney headquarters of the ABC after both organisations published stories containing classified information. The AFP has not ruled out charging journalists targeted in the raids, despite the public interest nature of their reporting. The search warrants used in the raids are being challenged in court. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said the government should shut down the AFP investigation. \u201cPeople should not be charged for doing their job. Journalism isn\u2019t a crime, it\u2019s an essential part of our democracy, we need to cherish it,\u201d Albanese told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. \u201cWe need to make sure whatever legislative changes are required to ensure media freedoms are adopted, it should happen in a bi-partisan way and it should happen quickly.\u201d The cases kicked off an examination of press freedom in Australia, with two parliamentary inquiries tasked with looking at the issue. On Friday, media chiefs appeared at a public committee hearing in Canberra to outline challenges with Australian laws. Meanwhile, Porter is counting on commonwealth law to override Australian Capital Territory legislation which legalises small amounts of cannabis from next year, rather than actively moving against it. \u201cAt the moment, their law has not done what it thinks it does, which provides some sort of defence or out for people who would be possessing cannabis in the ACT,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do that \u2026 they have not achieved what it is I think they set out to achieve, legally.\u201d The ACT decriminalised cannabis in 1992, meaning anyone found with the drug (up to 50g and two plants) is dealt with through civil penalties, rather than a court notice. In announcing the legalisation, the ACT government said it was a small \u201cnext step\u201d. South Australia and the Northern Territory have also decriminalised cannabis. Porter appeared to be saying that in all cases, the commonwealth law overrode the territory law, but could give no indication of which one police would follow. \u201cThey uphold the laws that exist both state and federal or territory and federal,\u201d he said. Porter said he had written to the ACT\u2019s attorney general, Gordon Ramsay, to say the territory bill, which would allow adults up to 50g of cannabis and to cultivate two plants for personal use, did not alter commonwealth laws, which criminalised cannabis possession. Porter said he had received advice on the \u201cterrible laws\u201d, showing commonwealth law was \u201cstill valid\u201d, adding he saw that if the ACT law was left as it was, \u201cwhy would there be any need to override a law, which is effectively to no effect\u201d. \u201cThe ACT laws removed the criminal component at a territory level, but didn\u2019t establish anything that is a positive right to possess, which means there is no defence to commonwealth law that criminalises amounts under 50g,\u201d he said. \u201cMy advice, and the advice that I have provided to the ACT attorney general, is that it is still against the law to possess cannabis in the ACT.\u201d After the ACT passed the Labor backbencher Michael Pettersson\u2019s private member\u2019s bill last month, Ramsay acknowledged the conflict with the commonwealth law, but said he believed \u201cin practice\u201d it would not apply.",

      "bodyText": "ABC chair Ita Buttrose has called for additional funding for international broadcasting so the public broadcaster can be a \u201cclarion\u201d voice of trusted news and play a bigger role in soft diplomacy in the region. \u201cThe importance of journalism to our country\u2019s Asia-Pacific interests cannot be underestimated and I believe a renewed ABC focus on international broadcasting would greatly benefit Australia,\u201d Buttrose said in her Lowy Institute media lecture. \u201cThe ability to report critically on our own political system is a powerful demonstration of democratic values, particularly to countries with limited press freedom. \u201cAs a statutory independent broadcaster, the ABC has a reputation throughout the region for its credible, frank and impartial coverage of our own backyard.\u201d Buttrose announced the ABC would launch an international version of its iView streaming platform, called ABC Australia iView, at the end of the month. However, the cost of international TV rights means the offering will be limited to selected episodes of ABC titles, including Australian Story, Four Corners, Gardening Australia and Waltzing the Dragon. Buttrose compared the ABC\u2019s limited funding for international broadcasting since the termination of the Australia Network with the BBC World Service, which receives \u00a3330m (A$623) a year. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade cut the ABC\u2019s international service, which had broadcast content to 46 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and had a potential audience of 144 million people, in the May 2014 budget. Australia has fallen from sixth to 10th place in the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Public Diplomacy Soft Power 30 index since 2015. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ABC\u2019s international arm now has ABC Australia, which broadcasts into 40 territories across the Indo-Pacific region, Radio Australia and an international app. The former magazine and newspaper editor said the ABC is a key soft-power asset available to the nation and should be used as such. \u201cThe ABC is Australia\u2019s trusted voice in Asia and the Pacific,\u201d Buttrose said. \u201cIt has a proud record of achievement, having told Australian stories, reported fairly and fearlessly, taught generations to speak English and delivered critical information in times of crisis for 80 years. \u201cWith additional support the ABC could expand its ability to reach out and share Australian perspectives to the world and enable Australians to better understand their Pacific neighbours.\u201d Buttrose said she had spoken to former and current ministers for communications about additional funding for the ABC, which was cut by $83.7m in the May 2018 budget. \u201cI did suggest to Mitch Fifield that less reviews into the ABC would mean they had more money,\u201d she said in a Q&amp;A with the executive director of the Lowy Institute, Michael Fullilove. The ABC was subjected to a second efficiency review by Fifield which concluded that the ABC needed long-term funding certainty. The Lowy Institute media award was won by Nick McKenzie and Sashka Koloff for \u201cInterference\u201d, a joint investigation by the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and ABC\u2019s Four Corners about Chinese political influence in Australia.",
