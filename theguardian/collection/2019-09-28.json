More than 10,000 people filled Swan Street in the heart of Richmond to celebrate the 7.12 (114) v 3.7 (25) win \u2013 mostly scenes of euphoric singing and chanting but some of the crowd grew raucous and uninhibited. Celebrations quickly turned chaotic and police arrested dozens of fans outside pubs and on streets. One, Michael Greene, 59, the estranged father of controversial Greater Western Sydney player Toby Greene, appeared in Melbourne magistrates court on Sunday charged with intentionally cause injury, resist police and assault police after allegedly headbutting a female police officer. He did not apply for bail and was remanded to appear at the Ringwood magistrates court next month. In a separate incident a 21-year-old Brookfield man bit a police officer and a 27-year-old Brookfield man hit another policeman on the back of the head when they were spoken to about their behaviour. Both have been charged with assaulting police and were released on bail. The officer who was bitten was taken to hospital to be treated.

The crowds grew louder with each chorus of \u201cTigerland\u201d, the Richmond song belted out by victorious players after the match, and thousands of times subsequent by celebrating fans.

The UK has turned its nose up at factory work, but the truth is most people who work in the factories love it. There is a great camaraderie. There is pride.\u201d It\u2019s not just about existing workers, but future proofing, too. \u201cThere aren\u2019t the same number of people trained to do what we need, so we need to create a separate stream in schools that takes care of those who aren\u2019t naturally academically minded. If we make manufacturing cool and sexy, people will want to do it and for many it will be far more rewarding than struggling through a uni degree that doesn\u2019t really lead anywhere,\u201d says Grant. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about setting different objectives,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s what is exciting about social enterprise: it\u2019s not about creating riches for already rich people, it\u2019s about a new set of constituents and serving the community, serving employees and making customers feel good about doing something that has been forgotten for a long time.\u201d Now that\u2019s a headline we can get on board with.

      "body": "<h2>A constructive approach to prison life</h2> <p>When students at Central Saint Martins were asked by the Ministry of Justice to come up with ideas for a new range of prison cell furniture the brief was complex but precise. \u201cEverything had to be strong, safe and sustainable. It also had to improve prisoners\u2019 welfare in practical, cost-effective ways,\u201d explains the project\u2019s director, Professor Lorraine Gamman of CSM\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.designagainstcrime.com/\" title=\"\">Design Against Crime Research Centre</a>.</p> <p>To try to understand the challenges of life behind bars, students visited HM\u2019s prisons, talking to staff and inmates. During their research for the Cell Furniture Project; they found that furniture bears the brunt of prisoners\u2019 frustrations. It can be smashed or dismembered to be used as a weapon. \u201cPrisoners can also be creative, flipping cupboards on their side to make tables, rolling up mattresses to make punch bags for exercise,\u201d says Gamman. Their findings revealed different types of inmates. \u201cSome want to study, others to exercise or meditate, others are obsessed with cleanliness,\u201d explains researcher Jeffrey Doruff.</p> <p>As a starting point, students focused on \u201cthe use, misuse and abuse of furniture\u201d, removing any potentially dangerous components. They also looked at ways of improving other elements of prison-cell life, such as privacy, ergonomics or cleanliness.</p> <p>Sixteen students took part in the project and their designs range from the Scandi-esque to the ingenious. One set of colourful cubes functions as seating, storage and exercise equipment; customisable shelving addresses the lack of personal space in shared cells. Instead of conventional MDF or metal, students used safer, recyclable materials including cardboard or cork. One tackled the all-pervading problem of smell by using charcoal to absorb odours.</p> <p>For Gamman, an advocate of restorative justice, equally important are the furniture workshops for inmates. Alongside traditional joinery techniques, prisoners will learn how to recycle materials such as plastic.</p> <p>\u201cThese are vocational skills that can help inmates find employment after prison,\u201d she says. \u201cImproved design can\u2019t mend what the <a href=\"https://howardleague.org/\" title=\"\">charity The Howard League</a> has called our \u2018broken system\u2019 but flexible furniture, which delivers tangible human benefits, can be part of the solution.\u201d <strong>Serena Fokschaner</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/design\"><br></a>Breaking the mould with DIY science</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b57f3f31094b7ad0a3efeb7c714eb38692fc4f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b57f3f31094b7ad0a3efeb7c714eb38692fc4f23/0_191_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playful terrazzo-style furniture from the Thing Thing collection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playful terrazzo-style furniture from the Thing Thing collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.thingthing.us/\" title=\"\">Thing Thing</a> is a band of industrial designers who take a joyous, playful approach to recycling plastic. Thom Moran, Simon Anton, Eiji Jimbo and Rachel Mulder crossed paths at Michigan\u2019s Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning \u2013 and in 2012 came together as a gaggle of mad professors in plastic reinvention. \u201cWe had no idea how to run a business,\u201d says Anton. \u201cWe were purely inspired by the excitement of working with this amazing \u2013 and horrifying \u2013 material. We lived together in a big house in Detroit and made the strangest, most playful things we could.\u201d</p> <p>Imagine industrial product design done from an off-grid garage microbrewery and you\u2019ll have some idea of how Thing Thing works. They have adapted machinery to create their own versions of industrial tools \u2013 plastic extruders, injection and compression moulds \u2013 which allows for handcrafted one-off bespoke and short-run pieces. The products are not only beautiful (a happy outcome), but a practical response to our big plastic problem.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody already knows [the current state of] ecological disaster,\u201d says Anton. \u201cShaking our finger at the public isn\u2019t going to change anything. As designers we have the opportunity to approach the problem creatively and offer new narratives. Something that makes it beautiful enough to smuggle into refined environments.\u201d</p> <p>Thing Thing\u2019s solutions range from stools made by shaping shredded waste plastic in a frying pan to the complex moulding used for their Pillow Lamps. Currently they\u2019re developing a substance called \u201cdimensional lumber\u201d using hand-recycled HDPE plastics and big ovens. Their innovative manufacturing processes are just as inspiring as the playful terrazzo-style materials they produce. Tackling big problems with positivity: a step in the right direction. <strong>Anna Burns</strong></p> <h2>High romance heads to the high street</h2> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/2016/sep/01/luke-edward-hall-illustrator-designer-christies-burberry\" title=\"\">Luke Edward Hall</a>\u2019s foppish romanticism is heading to the high street with a capsule collection of homeware designed by the young artist for Habitat. His undulating line drawings of serpents and heroes from antiquity cover ceramic lamps, throws and cushions, while a suite inspired by a Habitat design from the 60s is reinvigorated with circus-tent stripes in a lively combination of sky-blue and emerald-green velvet.</p> <p>The sinuous lines, bold colours and classical references will be familiar to anyone who as followed Hall since he graduated from Central Saint Martins, where his final menswear collection \u2013 heavy on the tailoring and inspired by Keats\u2019 pastoral romance, Endymion \u2013 established him as an enthusiastic exponent of dandyish maximalism.</p> <p>In the seven years since, through his hand-painted ceramics, prints, fabrics and interiors, he has built an aesthetic utopia that sits somewhere between 1920s Bloomsbury and the fields of Elysium. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Habitat for many years,\u201d says Hall, who has copies of the company\u2019s catalogues from the 60s and 70s in his archive. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure bringing my designs to life with such an iconic British company.\u201d <strong>Murray Healy<br></strong><em>Products from \u00a350, <a href=\"https://www.habitat.co.uk/luke\">habitat.co.uk/luke</a></em></p> <h2>Berlin turns its sights to the walls of today</h2> <p>To mark the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gropius Bau\u2019s group exhibition Walking Through Walls features works by 26 artists including <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\" title=\"\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, Tagreed Darghouth and Yuan Yuan. The show, curated by Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath, explores the segregation and confinement caused by walls and political power structures through painting, sculpture, performance and photography. The museum is adjacent to a site where a few fragments of the Berlin Wall still remain. So it\u2019s a poignant location for a show looking at how walls separate people and how they affect those who live with them.</p> <p>Standout pieces include Danish artist <a href=\"https://nilsstaerk.dk/news/418-michael-kvium-cirkus-europa-arken-museum-of-modern-art-denmark\" title=\"\">Michael Kvium\u2019s vast painting Beach of Plenty</a>, which at first glance looks like a happy holiday scene; look closely and it shows a dinghy filled with refugees approaching the shore. Another is the video and sound installation by Jerusalem-born and London-based artist Smadar Dreyfus. Mother\u2019s Day (2006-2008) is set at the Israeli-Syrian border at the Golan Heights, a zone between the two countries where a megaphone system is set up on mother\u2019s day so the generations can communicate.

This independent Swedish brand was born from that disappointment. Co-founders Jakob Dworsky and August Bard Bring\u00e9us were at Stockholm School of Economics rather than fashion college when their annoyance turned from grumbles to a business plan in 2015, and this unusual origin story has shaped the company. \u201cWe came into fashion as outsiders,\u201d Bard Bring\u00e9us says. \u201cWhat struck us was how absurd it is that we consume clothing as if it\u2019s disposable. The industry has normalised the notion that buying something like a T-shirt \u2013 a product that you keep for years \u2013 can cost less than the price of a lunch. We realised that we could disrupt the existing logic and lead a new approach to fashion.\u201d</p> <p>So, yes, the beautifully designed clothes come in a wide range of sizes and lengths for great fit, but supply chain is now the focus. The collection is permanent, avoiding the seasonal trend trap, and the merino wool used in crew-neck, polo-neck and zip-up jumpers is now <a href=\"https://www.asket.com/traceability/\" title=\"\">100% traceable</a>. \u201cEvery garment has a story and a cost. But if we don\u2019t know where or how it\u2019s produced, how can we possibly understand the effect it is having on people and the planet?\u201d Bard Bring\u00e9us asks. \u201cOnly by demanding traceability and transparency can we hold brands accountable for their actions.\u201d And if this all sounds a bit polemic, he can put it more simply for you: \u201cWe need to drastically slow down consumption as a whole, before our planet bursts.\u201d <strong>Alice Fisher</strong></p> <h2>Stopping the rot: fungal headphones</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"106712df4a9412c7437a11c9da1b65b44eea3c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/106712df4a9412c7437a11c9da1b65b44eea3c25/0_382_4480_3436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aivan Korvaa headphones, grown from fungus and yeast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aivan Korvaa headphones, grown from fungus and yeast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aivan Oy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suitable for fans of Mouldplay, these are the world\u2019s first headphones grown from fungus and yeast. <a href=\"https://www.aivan.fi/portfolio/korvaa-headset-made-by-microbes/\" title=\"\">Korvaa</a> (from the Finnish <em>korva</em> for \u201cear\u201d and <em>korvaa,</em>\u201cto replace\u201d) were made by Helsinki studio Aivan, with scientists, to showcase synthetic biology, which applies engineering principles to biology.

      "bodyText": "A constructive approach to prison life When students at Central Saint Martins were asked by the Ministry of Justice to come up with ideas for a new range of prison cell furniture the brief was complex but precise. \u201cEverything had to be strong, safe and sustainable. It also had to improve prisoners\u2019 welfare in practical, cost-effective ways,\u201d explains the project\u2019s director, Professor Lorraine Gamman of CSM\u2019s Design Against Crime Research Centre. To try to understand the challenges of life behind bars, students visited HM\u2019s prisons, talking to staff and inmates. During their research for the Cell Furniture Project; they found that furniture bears the brunt of prisoners\u2019 frustrations. It can be smashed or dismembered to be used as a weapon. \u201cPrisoners can also be creative, flipping cupboards on their side to make tables, rolling up mattresses to make punch bags for exercise,\u201d says Gamman. Their findings revealed different types of inmates. \u201cSome want to study, others to exercise or meditate, others are obsessed with cleanliness,\u201d explains researcher Jeffrey Doruff. As a starting point, students focused on \u201cthe use, misuse and abuse of furniture\u201d, removing any potentially dangerous components. They also looked at ways of improving other elements of prison-cell life, such as privacy, ergonomics or cleanliness. Sixteen students took part in the project and their designs range from the Scandi-esque to the ingenious. One set of colourful cubes functions as seating, storage and exercise equipment; customisable shelving addresses the lack of personal space in shared cells. Instead of conventional MDF or metal, students used safer, recyclable materials including cardboard or cork. One tackled the all-pervading problem of smell by using charcoal to absorb odours. For Gamman, an advocate of restorative justice, equally important are the furniture workshops for inmates. Alongside traditional joinery techniques, prisoners will learn how to recycle materials such as plastic. \u201cThese are vocational skills that can help inmates find employment after prison,\u201d she says. \u201cImproved design can\u2019t mend what the charity The Howard League has called our \u2018broken system\u2019 but flexible furniture, which delivers tangible human benefits, can be part of the solution.\u201d Serena Fokschaner Breaking the mould with DIY science Thing Thing is a band of industrial designers who take a joyous, playful approach to recycling plastic. Thom Moran, Simon Anton, Eiji Jimbo and Rachel Mulder crossed paths at Michigan\u2019s Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning \u2013 and in 2012 came together as a gaggle of mad professors in plastic reinvention. \u201cWe had no idea how to run a business,\u201d says Anton. \u201cWe were purely inspired by the excitement of working with this amazing \u2013 and horrifying \u2013 material. We lived together in a big house in Detroit and made the strangest, most playful things we could.\u201d Imagine industrial product design done from an off-grid garage microbrewery and you\u2019ll have some idea of how Thing Thing works. They have adapted machinery to create their own versions of industrial tools \u2013 plastic extruders, injection and compression moulds \u2013 which allows for handcrafted one-off bespoke and short-run pieces. The products are not only beautiful (a happy outcome), but a practical response to our big plastic problem. \u201cEverybody already knows [the current state of] ecological disaster,\u201d says Anton. \u201cShaking our finger at the public isn\u2019t going to change anything. As designers we have the opportunity to approach the problem creatively and offer new narratives. Something that makes it beautiful enough to smuggle into refined environments.\u201d Thing Thing\u2019s solutions range from stools made by shaping shredded waste plastic in a frying pan to the complex moulding used for their Pillow Lamps. Currently they\u2019re developing a substance called \u201cdimensional lumber\u201d using hand-recycled HDPE plastics and big ovens. Their innovative manufacturing processes are just as inspiring as the playful terrazzo-style materials they produce. Tackling big problems with positivity: a step in the right direction. Anna Burns High romance heads to the high street Luke Edward Hall\u2019s foppish romanticism is heading to the high street with a capsule collection of homeware designed by the young artist for Habitat. His undulating line drawings of serpents and heroes from antiquity cover ceramic lamps, throws and cushions, while a suite inspired by a Habitat design from the 60s is reinvigorated with circus-tent stripes in a lively combination of sky-blue and emerald-green velvet. The sinuous lines, bold colours and classical references will be familiar to anyone who as followed Hall since he graduated from Central Saint Martins, where his final menswear collection \u2013 heavy on the tailoring and inspired by Keats\u2019 pastoral romance, Endymion \u2013 established him as an enthusiastic exponent of dandyish maximalism. In the seven years since, through his hand-painted ceramics, prints, fabrics and interiors, he has built an aesthetic utopia that sits somewhere between 1920s Bloomsbury and the fields of Elysium. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Habitat for many years,\u201d says Hall, who has copies of the company\u2019s catalogues from the 60s and 70s in his archive. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure bringing my designs to life with such an iconic British company.\u201d Murray Healy Products from \u00a350, habitat.co.uk/luke Berlin turns its sights to the walls of today To mark the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gropius Bau\u2019s group exhibition Walking Through Walls features works by 26 artists including Marina Abramovi\u0107, Tagreed Darghouth and Yuan Yuan. The show, curated by Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath, explores the segregation and confinement caused by walls and political power structures through painting, sculpture, performance and photography. The museum is adjacent to a site where a few fragments of the Berlin Wall still remain. So it\u2019s a poignant location for a show looking at how walls separate people and how they affect those who live with them. Standout pieces include Danish artist Michael Kvium\u2019s vast painting Beach of Plenty, which at first glance looks like a happy holiday scene; look closely and it shows a dinghy filled with refugees approaching the shore. Another is the video and sound installation by Jerusalem-born and London-based artist Smadar Dreyfus. Mother\u2019s Day (2006-2008) is set at the Israeli-Syrian border at the Golan Heights, a zone between the two countries where a megaphone system is set up on mother\u2019s day so the generations can communicate. The work features recordings of greetings sent between Druze women in Israel\u2019s Golan Heights and their children on the Syrian side of the border. Becky Sunshine Walking Through Walls at Gropius Bau, Berlin, is open until 19 January Traditional glassmakers go retro-futuristic This October sees the launch of Laguna, Achille Salvagni\u2019s new collection of furniture and decorative objects for which he travelled to Murano to work with the legendary glass masters. \u201cWorking with Murano has enabled me to embrace colour,\u201d says Salvagni, who was inspired to use their glass \u201cas a functional surface rather than just a decorative one, which is quite a novel approach. To have it as a table top or a handle invites the user to touch it.\u201d Laguna draws on aspects of Mediterranean culture even more ancient than Murano\u2019s glassmaking traditions: it features a bar cabinet decorated with black glass details, and fluidly curvaceous vases and candle holders named after Greek gods. There are also new versions of two Salvagni retro-future classics, the Drop table and Spider chandelier. \u201cMurano glass has been used in chandeliers for centuries,\u201d says the designer, \u201cso to use it in this very contemporary fashion is very exciting.\u201d Murray Healy The collection will be available at PAD London (pad-fairs.com) Celebrating the art school at the height of fashion In the spring of 1939, St Martins School of Art moved into new premises at 107-109 Charing Cross Road. \u201cNow the school is properly housed,\u201d London county council leader Herbert Morrison declared, \u201cwe hope the students will take full advantage of the opportunities afforded for studying.\u201d They did, as Hywel Davies and Cally Blackman\u2019s vibrant new history, Fashion Central Saint Martins (Thames &amp; Hudson), explores \u2013 albeit in ways well beyond Morrison\u2019s imagining. Over the deades, the building the Observer dubbed an \u201castonishing honeycomb\u201d would play host to generation after generation of groundbreaking talent. It was where the Sex Pistols played their first gig, where John Galliano\u2019s unique vision ignited and where Alexander McQueen started down the path to stardom. And through this book, many of its extraordinary students \u2013 among them Bill Gibb, Hussein Chalayan, Katie Grand, Phoebe Philo, Riccardo Tisci, Gareth Pugh and Christopher Kane \u2013 reflect on CSM\u2019s impact. As Katharine Hamnett, a graduate from the class of 69, puts it: \u201cI owe them the debt of my life.\u201d At its core, it\u2019s a heartfelt tribute to the school\u2019s equally extraordinary teachers, from pioneering Muriel Pemberton and unflappable Bobby Hillson to formidable Louise Wilson. They shaped an educational phenomenon that occupies a unique space in British fashion. A spotlight on South Africa\u2019s daring design For more than a decade, the Southern Guild gallery in Cape Town has championed South African design. Now this month, Southern Guild will show in the UK for the first time, with an exhibition at the PAD London fair. As well as representing the country\u2019s most established artists and makers, Southern Guild is also a home for rising stars, from multidisciplinary artist Atang Tshikare, who specialises in sculptural furniture, to fashion designer Rich Mnisi, whose first collection of minimalist leather seating was inspired by his late great-grandmother. \u201cThe idea of collectible design is relatively new, it\u2019s only since the international design fairs took off that it has become more mainstream,\u201d says South African Trevyn McGowan, who set up the gallery with her British husband Julian. \u201cIn 2011 we were the first African gallery to present work at Design Miami and I realised that we were part of this movement.\u201d The couple decided to launch the gallery after Trevyn\u2019s experiences at her interior design and architectural practice in London, sourcing South African furnishings and home accessories for stores such as Liberty and Heal\u2019s (Julian worked as a set designer back then). \u201cThere were artists whose larger-scale pieces made from more expensive materials didn\u2019t fit into that exporting model,\u201d she recalls. Since then, the pair has made a name for the gallery and its artists on a global scale. \u201cWe\u2019re not just representing artists,\u201d says Trevyn, \u201cwhat we\u2019ve done over the years is propel the industry forward by providing a platform for creative collaborations, mentorship, museum shows and international exchanges.\u201d The couple are also inspired by a desire to explore South African issues, be it politics, history or tribal heritage. \u201cAll our makers have their own narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cSo they produce incredibly personal pieces that could only be made by them.\u201d Emma Love Six Southern Guild artists to watch: Rich Mnisi, furniture Johannesburg born designer Rich Mnisi has made a name for himself in fashion with his award-winning line which has been worn by Beyonce and Naomi Campbell. The Nwa-Mulamula sofa, named after his great-grandmother, is his first forray into furniture. Andile Dyalvane, ceramicist Renowned Cape Town-based ceramicist Andile Dyalvane explores his Xhosa heritage. His hand-built terracotta and stoneware pieces are often named after farming machinery or crops, whether it\u2019s an interpretation of a traditional African milk pail or a bowl formed from overlapping layers of clay that represent textures caused by soil erosion. Porky Hefer, designer From lifesize nests woven with Kooboo cane inspired by the weaver bird to his new leather seating pod made especially for PAD London, Porky Hefer\u2019s playful pieces use age-old techniques. In 2016, he represented South Africaat the inaugural London Design Biennale; last year he was commissioned by art consultants for the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. Dokter and Misses, product design Industrial designer Adriaan Hugo and graphic designer Katy Taplin are the husband-and-wife team behind this Johannesburg-based multidisciplinary design company that produces bold, modernist furniture and lighting. Contemporary reworkings of traditional African patterns are a key feature, as seen on pieces such as the hand-painted beech Kassena Isibheqe Servercabinet, which references the adobe structures of the Kassena people of Burkina Faso. Justine Mahoney, sculptor Justine Mahoney\u2019s work looks at childhood, especially dreams and the loss of innocence. Her own youth as a privileged white girl in 70s Johannesburg is the main inspiration for her kitsch bronze sculptures based on cut-and-paste collages of pop culture. Her first show looked at childhood while the second focussed on teenagers, including an emotionally conflicted \u201cSleeping Samurai\u201d female warrior who appears outwardly strong yet still wears school shoes. Athi-Patra Ruga, artist Anyone who has walked past the windows of the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London\u2019s Southbank this summer will have seen Athi-Patra Ruga\u2019s images of avatars. The artist \u2013 whose work spans film, photography, sculpture and textiles, and is part of the permanent collection at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art in Cape Town \u2013 is known for his vision of utopia populated by characters who explore post-apartheid politics in South Africa. His latest piece, Proposed Model of the New Azanian, is a large-scale tapestry. A brand for all seasons If you\u2019ve ever been baffled by how hard it is to find quality menswear basics, then Asket is for you. This independent Swedish brand was born from that disappointment. Co-founders Jakob Dworsky and August Bard Bring\u00e9us were at Stockholm School of Economics rather than fashion college when their annoyance turned from grumbles to a business plan in 2015, and this unusual origin story has shaped the company. \u201cWe came into fashion as outsiders,\u201d Bard Bring\u00e9us says. \u201cWhat struck us was how absurd it is that we consume clothing as if it\u2019s disposable. The industry has normalised the notion that buying something like a T-shirt \u2013 a product that you keep for years \u2013 can cost less than the price of a lunch. We realised that we could disrupt the existing logic and lead a new approach to fashion.\u201d So, yes, the beautifully designed clothes come in a wide range of sizes and lengths for great fit, but supply chain is now the focus. The collection is permanent, avoiding the seasonal trend trap, and the merino wool used in crew-neck, polo-neck and zip-up jumpers is now 100% traceable. \u201cEvery garment has a story and a cost. But if we don\u2019t know where or how it\u2019s produced, how can we possibly understand the effect it is having on people and the planet?\u201d Bard Bring\u00e9us asks. \u201cOnly by demanding traceability and transparency can we hold brands accountable for their actions.\u201d And if this all sounds a bit polemic, he can put it more simply for you: \u201cWe need to drastically slow down consumption as a whole, before our planet bursts.\u201d Alice Fisher Stopping the rot: fungal headphones Suitable for fans of Mouldplay, these are the world\u2019s first headphones grown from fungus and yeast. Korvaa (from the Finnish korva for \u201cear\u201d and korvaa,\u201cto replace\u201d) were made by Helsinki studio Aivan, with scientists, to showcase synthetic biology, which applies engineering principles to biology. The idea was documentarist Nina Pulkkis\u2019s: working on a film about SynBio, she \u201chad lots of lab samples, but wanted to show what it can do. Could we make a real object?

In 10 years, will we look back and think our reliance on plastic was madness? \u201cWe look at it now,\u201d Pulkkis says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s madness.\u201d Johnny Davis The Gentlewoman: a 10-year-old\u2019s party you will want to crash In her first \u2013 and only \u2013 editor\u2019s letter in The Gentlewoman, Penny Martin set out her store for the biannual magazine. It would show women as they \u201cactually look, sound and dress\u201d, while subjects would be \u201cstylish, intrepid and often hilarious\u201d.

Rather than crushing expensive paving slabs for rubble in foundations, as usually happens, why not keep the value of the material in its original form?</p> \n<p>Founded as an architectural collective in 2005, Rotor have built an international reputation for their provocative research projects and exhibitions, which often expose the hidden forces that shape our material environment. They curated a warts-and-all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/09/rem-koolhaas-oma-progress-barbican\">monographic show on the work of Rem Koolhaas\u2019s firm, OMA, at the Barbican</a>, which included models scavenged from the bins alongside walls of client correspondence.

One of the materials she singles out is called malai, a substance made from bacteria in coconut water. Sourced from farmers in southern India it\u2019s a byproduct of the white flesh harvested from coconuts. The water ferments in vats for two weeks, during which time a sheet of cellulose jelly forms. Mixed with natural fibres and resins, this jelly can be manufactured into small \u201cleather\u201d goods.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome of these materials are happy accidents,\u201d says Solanki. \u201cBut mostly, each is the result of rigorous research and development. There is no point making a material just for the sake of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Solanki studied textile design at Central Saint Martins before working across fashion, architecture, lighting and automotive design for over a decade. \u201cI always questioned my role. There was so much waste produced because material designers simply weren\u2019t fully integrated in the process. I wanted to create a place for material designers to feel understood.\u201d</p> \n<p>Solanki set up <a href=\"https://ma-tt-er.org/\">Ma-tt-er</a> \u2013 a materials research design studio, consultancy and school \u2013 in 2015. \u201cIt begins with teaching,\u201d she stresses. The workshops, talks and courses run by the studio aren\u2019t just for designers: Solanki has helped a doctor develop a biodegradable material for tissue engineering; and a chef recently turned up with a enzyme that occurs in meat. (\u201cWe inflated it, and expanded it. It was spongy: <br> a bit like cake.\u201d)</p> \n<p>In the workshop, different processes are applied to create new materials. \u201cSeaweed is a good example,\u201d Solanki explains. \u201cDepending on how you process it, seaweed can be a fuel, a dye, a textile, food, furniture, beauty products \u2026 We are championing this whole-systems approach to responsible materials.\u201d</p> \n<p>Solanki is also championing the next generation of material designers. Earlier this year, in association with <a href=\"http://www.materialdesigners.eu/\">MaDe</a> (a European project which promotes circular economies), Ma-tt-er launched an open-call competition for designers. Of the entrants, 120 have been chosen to attend workshops throughout the year. (In the UK, these are taking place at the London Design Festival this month.) Those who make it to the next round will develop and exhibit their materials at Milan Design Week, Barcelona Design Week and London Design Festival in 2020. Three finalists will win a paid industry placement. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity I wish I\u2019d had,\u201d admits Solanki.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Building a future from the ground up: Rotor Deconstruction In the centre of Brussels stands a huge warehouse brimming with lampshades and doorknobs, marble slabs and school chairs. Nineteenth century solid oak doors from Antwerp City Hall lie on one shelf, while floor tiles from a postwar office block are piled up nearby, next to row upon row of ceramic toilets. \u201cForestry in the city\u201d is how Belgian architect Maarten Gielen describes the work of his practice, Rotor Deconstruction, where the wood isn\u2019t from living trees, but harvested from condemned buildings. \u201cEvery year, each Brussels resident creates over half a tonne of construction waste, while we import about the same amount of new material,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect the two streams.\u201d Architectural salvage may have been around for centuries, but Gielen\u2019s firm is trying to kickstart a radical shift in the way architects and builders think about construction, designing for reuse from the beginning, and changing people\u2019s perceptions of the value of secondhand materials. With global construction waste estimated to double to 2.2bn tonnes a year by 2025, most of which ends up as landfill, they are calling for an urgent change in attitudes to the lifespan of building components, and a move away from recycling towards reusing. Rather than crushing expensive paving slabs for rubble in foundations, as usually happens, why not keep the value of the material in its original form? Founded as an architectural collective in 2005, Rotor have built an international reputation for their provocative research projects and exhibitions, which often expose the hidden forces that shape our material environment. They curated a warts-and-all monographic show on the work of Rem Koolhaas\u2019s firm, OMA, at the Barbican, which included models scavenged from the bins alongside walls of client correspondence. For the Venice Biennale, they displayed worn carpets and chipped handrails from various Belgian municipal buildings as if they were precious relics. Their unlikely decision to set up a demolition company came in 2016, after years of frustration with what they saw as the architecture world\u2019s lazy approach to \u201csustainability\u201d. Operating as policy wonks as much as architects, Rotor approached the Brussels regional government and convinced the politicians to commission them to produce a new waste management plan for the region, which they crucially reframed as the \u201cmaterial\u201d management plan. The response was enthusiastic, but change was slow to come. \u201cIt takes a long time to make legislation,\u201d says Gielen, \u201cso we decided to get on with it ourselves.\u201d The first building they tackled was the former headquarters of Levi\u2019s jeans, full of partition walls framed in pale tropical hardwood, which they sold quickly and cheaply from the site, not realising their true value at the time. Now, their warehouse inventory ranges from steel keyholes for 50 cents to a pair of solid bronze doorhandles from a noted bank interior for \u20ac1,750. The work began as an incredibly labour intensive process, but, as time has gone on, the team have perfected their methods. For ceramic tiles, they now have a series of baths of biological acid that eats away at the mortar, leaving them looking as good as new and ready to lay.

It might sound like novelty \u201cupcycling\u201d, but Rotor are adamant that such repurposing must move from being a fringe pursuit to mainstream practice.

The Indestructible Puffer (15 times stronger than steel) follows in November, with the Deep Sleep Cocoon (designed to help you switch off in the most inhospitable places known to man) arriving just in time for Christmas. \u201cI think guys are open to stories. If someone says \u2018You can buy a normal hoodie, or one that can\u2019t be set on fire because it\u2019s made out of Kevlar\u2019,\u201d says Nick. \u201cThey respond to that. Developing a new leather\u2026 Are you ready for this jelly? Ma-tt-er At her studio in Hackney, east London, material designer Seetal Solanki sifts through her library. One of the materials she singles out is called malai, a substance made from bacteria in coconut water. Sourced from farmers in southern India it\u2019s a byproduct of the white flesh harvested from coconuts. The water ferments in vats for two weeks, during which time a sheet of cellulose jelly forms. Mixed with natural fibres and resins, this jelly can be manufactured into small \u201cleather\u201d goods. \u201cSome of these materials are happy accidents,\u201d says Solanki. \u201cBut mostly, each is the result of rigorous research and development. There is no point making a material just for the sake of it.\u201d Solanki studied textile design at Central Saint Martins before working across fashion, architecture, lighting and automotive design for over a decade. \u201cI always questioned my role. There was so much waste produced because material designers simply weren\u2019t fully integrated in the process. I wanted to create a place for material designers to feel understood.\u201d Solanki set up Ma-tt-er \u2013 a materials research design studio, consultancy and school \u2013 in 2015. \u201cIt begins with teaching,\u201d she stresses. The workshops, talks and courses run by the studio aren\u2019t just for designers: Solanki has helped a doctor develop a biodegradable material for tissue engineering; and a chef recently turned up with a enzyme that occurs in meat. (\u201cWe inflated it, and expanded it. It was spongy: a bit like cake.\u201d) In the workshop, different processes are applied to create new materials. \u201cSeaweed is a good example,\u201d Solanki explains. \u201cDepending on how you process it, seaweed can be a fuel, a dye, a textile, food, furniture, beauty products \u2026 We are championing this whole-systems approach to responsible materials.\u201d Solanki is also championing the next generation of material designers. Earlier this year, in association with MaDe (a European project which promotes circular economies), Ma-tt-er launched an open-call competition for designers. Of the entrants, 120 have been chosen to attend workshops throughout the year. (In the UK, these are taking place at the London Design Festival this month.) Those who make it to the next round will develop and exhibit their materials at Milan Design Week, Barcelona Design Week and London Design Festival in 2020. Three finalists will win a paid industry placement. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity I wish I\u2019d had,\u201d admits Solanki.",

      "body": "<p>Nicholas Coleridge, for so long the great panjandrum of the UK wing of the Cond\u00e9 Nast empire, still remembers with perfect clarity the moment he fell in love with glossy magazines. Lying ill in bed at the age of 16, he opened a copy of <em>Harpers &amp; Queen</em> he had borrowed from his mother, and the world tilted on its axis. \u201cThat first couple of hours with a glossy changed my life,\u201d he writes in his new memoir. \u201cI was mesmerised.\u201d He loved it all \u2013 the writing, the pictures, even the \u201cgentle waft\u201d of fragrance that emanated from the advertisers\u2019 scent strips \u2013 and in a heartbeat he knew that it was in this world he wanted to make his career. Even as he was still in his pyjamas, he was scribbling an article. It was called How to Survive Teenage Parties \u2013 a piece that, he says now, sought to define the different kinds of people you would meet at groovy gatherings on \u201cthe wild frontier\u201d between Sussex, where his family had a house, and Hampshire.</p> <p>In the long years since, little has changed. The love affair continues. Coleridge will finally leave Vogue House, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s London HQ, at the end of this year, when he retires as chairman of the company. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/apr/15/why-our-magazines-are-defying-digital-erosion-by-conde-nast-chief\" title=\"\">But he remains fully in thrall to magazines.</a> Yes, many of them are in serious trouble (soon after we meet, it\u2019s announced that <em>Marie</em><em> Claire</em> is to close its UK print edition after 31 years). Yes, their budgets are vastly smaller than in the glory days (Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of <em>Vogue</em>, <em>GQ</em> and <em>House &amp; Garden</em>, has only just crept back into the black, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/03/vogue-publisher-conde-nast-annual-loss\" title=\"\">posting a loss of \u00a313.6m in 2017</a>). But, he insists, they are not dead yet \u2013 and nor have they become boring, whatever I might think (to me, they seem like catalogues now, lacking the wit and drama that I too once loved).</p> <p>\u201cI was just reading <em>World of Interiors</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new one had come up [to my office], and I was turning the pages, and I found it constantly exciting.\u201d I look at his face \u2013 it is ever smiling, though his grin undeniably has something of the assassin about it \u2013 trying to work out if he really means this. Is it possible for a man of his age and experience (or for anyone at all) truly to find sofas and pelmets constantly exciting? But I see no sign of irony, no hint of pretence. The <em>World of Interiors</em> in question now sits on a nearby ottoman, and judging by his body language it\u2019s all he can do not to leap out of his seat and begin flicking through it again this very second.</p> <p>Coleridge and I meet at his house in Chelsea: a stuccoed terrace in one of London\u2019s smartest streets (his neighbour is Richard Rogers; his corner shop is Peter Jones). The interior is pale and \u2013 to my untutored eyes \u2013 sort of Oka-ish, with top notes of Rajasthan (Coleridge loves India more than any other country, and some of his collection of Indian miniatures are arranged in a pyramid shape above the fireplace). On this sunny, early autumn afternoon, he is in a slightly skittish mood \u2013 and not only because he has a book \u2013 <em>The Glossy Years</em> \u2013 coming out, something that is \u201crather nerve-racking\u201d. Earlier today, at the House of Commons, he saw Boris Johnson\u2019s first performance at prime minister\u2019s questions, and listened to Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review (as chairman of the board of trustees at the V&amp;A, he was happy indeed to hear that museums are in for a small rise). \u201cAll I could see from my seat was his <em>blond</em><em> hair</em>,\u201d he says, somewhat wonderingly. \u201cAnd then, in front of me, was <em>Jeremy Corbyn</em>\u2026\u201d</p> <p>And how, since he has brought it up, does he feel about politics at the moment? Coleridge went to Eton and, as he notes in his book, not only are about a quarter of his closest friends Old Etonians; their networks are \u201cas deep and pervasive as Japanese knotweed\u201d. Quite a number of those with whom he went to school are involved, to a greater or lesser degree, in the current crisis, from Charles Moore, the former editor of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/labour-has-support-for-legisation-to-block-no-deal-says-chakrabarti\" title=\"\">Oliver Letwin</a>, one of the Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the government earlier this month. Does he have to avoid certain subjects at dinner parties? Yes. \u201cI never now mention the referendum or anything that flows from it. I never mention it at work, either, though I imagine that the majority of my colleagues are remain.\u201d A one nation Tory, he wasn\u2019t an \u201cardent\u201d remainer, though he voted that way in the referendum. His main feeling now is that he wishes there had never been a referendum in the first place. It simply wasn\u2019t necessary: \u201cThings were going well enough.\u201d</p> <p>And what about his privilege? One of the things I like about his book is that even as he gently sends up his background, he never tries to hide it; to pretend that it was anything other than extremely posh. He\u2019s perfectly happy to reveal, for instance, that at the age of five, one of his school friends casually informed him that his father owned an island in the West Indies (this was Mustique, and the boy in question was Charlie Tennant, the son of Princess Margaret\u2019s pal Lord Glenconner). Nor does he mind admitting that when he and two Eton friends decided to travel across Russia to Iran in their gap year, the mother of one of them, who happened to be the Duchess of Buccleuch, organised a weekend at her stately pile at which various distinguished experts were assembled to offer them advice (these experts, he writes, must have been utterly aghast at the boys\u2019 ignorance). Nevertheless, I wonder: is he ever embarrassed to be an Etonian? Especially at this particular moment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That was one of the things I loved about magazines. They were a window on another world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWell, our second son, Freddie, was reading my book at the weekend,\u201d he says, prevaricating madly (he and his wife, Georgia, a healer, have four children \u2013 and, in addition to this place, a grand-sounding house in Worcestershire). \u201cAnd he was struck by how much the world has changed in my lifetime.\u201d He goes on a bit about mobile phones, schools and certain attitudes \u2013 and of course, he and Freddie are right. Things <em>have</em> changed. But then again, they\u2019ve hardly changed at all: Etonians, as I now point out, are still running the country. \u201cWell,\u201d he says again. \u201cAt this <em>precise</em> moment, Etonians are all killing each other, aren\u2019t they? I was at the GQ man of the year awards, and as Rory Stewart [another Old Etonian] was handed his rather ugly, plastic trophy [for politician of the year], <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/men-of-the-year/article/rory-stewart-gq-awards-politician-brexit\" title=\"\">he did make the remark that he was expecting to be fired</a> \u2013 and he duly was [by Boris Johnson, also an alumnus of that very expensive school near Windsor].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ce5056836b038a58ac14e83c54404252b6db40a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce5056836b038a58ac14e83c54404252b6db40a/473_53_2231_2900/769.jpg\" alt=\"Coleridge at the Conde Nast offices, Vogue House, London, 2003.\" width=\"769\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coleridge at the Conde Nast offices, Vogue House, London, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Smith/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seriously, though. What about his privilege? Has he learned to check it? Even <em>Vogue</em> is woke now. For a few seconds, he hesitates. \u201cJournalism is not the same as being a banker or something,\u201d he finally says. His point, I think, is that, as the son of a man whose father was chairman of Lloyd\u2019s, he had no connections in Fleet Street or anywhere else in the media (later, he will email me to emphasise this). \u201cMy parents brought us up comfortably. But we weren\u2019t part of a rich beau monde. Candidly, that was one of the things I loved about magazines. They were a window on another world.\u201d</p> <p>Was he a reluctant memoirist, or an eager one? \u201cNeither, actually. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/08/ed-victor-obituary\" title=\"\">Ed Victor [the late literary agent]</a> rang me and said [he adopts a slow American twang]: \u2018I\u2019ve had this aaw-ffer from Penguin\u2026\u2019 My first thought was that I was too young [he is 62]. Then came a moment of slight vanity. Then I thought: perhaps no one else will ask. I was a freelance writer first, and thus, I\u2019m highly trained never to turn down money for words. So I said yes.\u201d And how did he find it? \u201cIt was immediately interesting.\u201d Things came back to him, though the great worry is that, over time, stories do get a bit tidied up. There may be some acquaintances who do not quite recognise the details on the page.</p> <p>And once his best anecdotes were all in place, of course, there was the agony of it being read.

Coleridge, though, was creative. Three days before his first column, he had the bright idea of disguising himself as a chauffeur and gatecrashing the party for the drivers of those attending Prince Andrew\u2019s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle. What cunning and guile, I say. \u201cYa! I remember it very well. It was slightly like catacombs. I recall the brickwork, about 100 drivers standing round.

From there, he was wooed to Cond\u00e9 Nast by Si Newhouse, its billionaire owner, to become the editorial director of its British company (later, he would become its managing director, and after that, the president of Cond\u00e9 Nast International).

Life was, in any case, very good.

A brief silence. \u201cI think there are lots of strands to this. <em>Vogue</em> is very expensive to produce \u2013 but so much of the work [the photography] that has been done in magazines over the past four decades is so important.

Perhaps, though, the Blows of this world were more up his street than, say, Princess Diana, who liked to pop into Vogue House for lunch, having tipped off the paps first: though he believed HRH looked fabulous at the time, and he was thrilled to the point of breathlessness when she asked him if her breasts were too small, he thinks now that \u201cher blue suit with gold buttons had something of an Aeroflot air stewardess about it\u201d. On the sly, he is quite the bohemian.</p> <p>Can magazines really survive in the digital age? He is determined that, at the top end of the market, they will. There is, he says, no better way for a company like Chanel to communicate with its select group of customers than via the pages of <em>Vogue</em> \u2013 and for these customers, in turn, <em>Vogue</em> is just \u201cpart of the kit, like <em>Horse &amp; Hound</em> in a groom\u2019s yard\u201d. And is Cond\u00e9 Nast finally becoming more egalitarian now? In the old days, those seeking a job there used to be required to give details, on paper, of any private income they had.

      "bodyText": "Nicholas Coleridge, for so long the great panjandrum of the UK wing of the Cond\u00e9 Nast empire, still remembers with perfect clarity the moment he fell in love with glossy magazines. Lying ill in bed at the age of 16, he opened a copy of Harpers &amp; Queen he had borrowed from his mother, and the world tilted on its axis. \u201cThat first couple of hours with a glossy changed my life,\u201d he writes in his new memoir. \u201cI was mesmerised.\u201d He loved it all \u2013 the writing, the pictures, even the \u201cgentle waft\u201d of fragrance that emanated from the advertisers\u2019 scent strips \u2013 and in a heartbeat he knew that it was in this world he wanted to make his career. Even as he was still in his pyjamas, he was scribbling an article. It was called How to Survive Teenage Parties \u2013 a piece that, he says now, sought to define the different kinds of people you would meet at groovy gatherings on \u201cthe wild frontier\u201d between Sussex, where his family had a house, and Hampshire. In the long years since, little has changed. The love affair continues. Coleridge will finally leave Vogue House, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s London HQ, at the end of this year, when he retires as chairman of the company. But he remains fully in thrall to magazines. Yes, many of them are in serious trouble (soon after we meet, it\u2019s announced that Marie Claire is to close its UK print edition after 31 years). Yes, their budgets are vastly smaller than in the glory days (Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of Vogue, GQ and House &amp; Garden, has only just crept back into the black, after posting a loss of \u00a313.6m in 2017). But, he insists, they are not dead yet \u2013 and nor have they become boring, whatever I might think (to me, they seem like catalogues now, lacking the wit and drama that I too once loved). \u201cI was just reading World of Interiors,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new one had come up [to my office], and I was turning the pages, and I found it constantly exciting.\u201d I look at his face \u2013 it is ever smiling, though his grin undeniably has something of the assassin about it \u2013 trying to work out if he really means this. Is it possible for a man of his age and experience (or for anyone at all) truly to find sofas and pelmets constantly exciting? But I see no sign of irony, no hint of pretence. The World of Interiors in question now sits on a nearby ottoman, and judging by his body language it\u2019s all he can do not to leap out of his seat and begin flicking through it again this very second. Coleridge and I meet at his house in Chelsea: a stuccoed terrace in one of London\u2019s smartest streets (his neighbour is Richard Rogers; his corner shop is Peter Jones). The interior is pale and \u2013 to my untutored eyes \u2013 sort of Oka-ish, with top notes of Rajasthan (Coleridge loves India more than any other country, and some of his collection of Indian miniatures are arranged in a pyramid shape above the fireplace). On this sunny, early autumn afternoon, he is in a slightly skittish mood \u2013 and not only because he has a book \u2013 The Glossy Years \u2013 coming out, something that is \u201crather nerve-racking\u201d. Earlier today, at the House of Commons, he saw Boris Johnson\u2019s first performance at prime minister\u2019s questions, and listened to Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review (as chairman of the board of trustees at the V&amp;A, he was happy indeed to hear that museums are in for a small rise). \u201cAll I could see from my seat was his blond hair,\u201d he says, somewhat wonderingly. \u201cAnd then, in front of me, was Jeremy Corbyn\u2026\u201d And how, since he has brought it up, does he feel about politics at the moment? Coleridge went to Eton and, as he notes in his book, not only are about a quarter of his closest friends Old Etonians; their networks are \u201cas deep and pervasive as Japanese knotweed\u201d. Quite a number of those with whom he went to school are involved, to a greater or lesser degree, in the current crisis, from Charles Moore, the former editor of the Daily Telegraph, to Oliver Letwin, one of the Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the government earlier this month. Does he have to avoid certain subjects at dinner parties? Yes. \u201cI never now mention the referendum or anything that flows from it. I never mention it at work, either, though I imagine that the majority of my colleagues are remain.\u201d A one nation Tory, he wasn\u2019t an \u201cardent\u201d remainer, though he voted that way in the referendum. His main feeling now is that he wishes there had never been a referendum in the first place. It simply wasn\u2019t necessary: \u201cThings were going well enough.\u201d And what about his privilege? One of the things I like about his book is that even as he gently sends up his background, he never tries to hide it; to pretend that it was anything other than extremely posh. He\u2019s perfectly happy to reveal, for instance, that at the age of five, one of his school friends casually informed him that his father owned an island in the West Indies (this was Mustique, and the boy in question was Charlie Tennant, the son of Princess Margaret\u2019s pal Lord Glenconner). Nor does he mind admitting that when he and two Eton friends decided to travel across Russia to Iran in their gap year, the mother of one of them, who happened to be the Duchess of Buccleuch, organised a weekend at her stately pile at which various distinguished experts were assembled to offer them advice (these experts, he writes, must have been utterly aghast at the boys\u2019 ignorance). Nevertheless, I wonder: is he ever embarrassed to be an Etonian? Especially at this particular moment. \u201cWell, our second son, Freddie, was reading my book at the weekend,\u201d he says, prevaricating madly (he and his wife, Georgia, a healer, have four children \u2013 and, in addition to this place, a grand-sounding house in Worcestershire). \u201cAnd he was struck by how much the world has changed in my lifetime.\u201d He goes on a bit about mobile phones, schools and certain attitudes \u2013 and of course, he and Freddie are right. Things have changed. But then again, they\u2019ve hardly changed at all: Etonians, as I now point out, are still running the country. \u201cWell,\u201d he says again. \u201cAt this precise moment, Etonians are all killing each other, aren\u2019t they? I was at the GQ man of the year awards, and as Rory Stewart [another Old Etonian] was handed his rather ugly, plastic trophy [for politician of the year], he did make the remark that he was expecting to be fired \u2013 and he duly was [by Boris Johnson, also an alumnus of that very expensive school near Windsor].\u201d Seriously, though. What about his privilege? Has he learned to check it? Even Vogue is woke now. For a few seconds, he hesitates. \u201cJournalism is not the same as being a banker or something,\u201d he finally says. His point, I think, is that, as the son of a man whose father was chairman of Lloyd\u2019s, he had no connections in Fleet Street or anywhere else in the media (later, he will email me to emphasise this). \u201cMy parents brought us up comfortably. But we weren\u2019t part of a rich beau monde. Candidly, that was one of the things I loved about magazines. They were a window on another world.\u201d Was he a reluctant memoirist, or an eager one? \u201cNeither, actually. Ed Victor [the late literary agent] rang me and said [he adopts a slow American twang]: \u2018I\u2019ve had this aaw-ffer from Penguin\u2026\u2019 My first thought was that I was too young [he is 62]. Then came a moment of slight vanity. Then I thought: perhaps no one else will ask. I was a freelance writer first, and thus, I\u2019m highly trained never to turn down money for words. So I said yes.\u201d And how did he find it? \u201cIt was immediately interesting.\u201d Things came back to him, though the great worry is that, over time, stories do get a bit tidied up. There may be some acquaintances who do not quite recognise the details on the page. And once his best anecdotes were all in place, of course, there was the agony of it being read. He sent off the manuscript to his first boss, Tina Brown, the former editor of Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and Tatler (where she employed him), in the hope of getting a nice jacket quote out of her. \u201cYou have a pavlovian response to your first boss,\u201d he says. \u201cThey always remain that.\u201d When Brown did praise The Glossy Years, he must have felt a bit as he used to in the old days, when he used to win her over in editorial conferences by punting stories about well-hung dukes, society wives who\u2019d once been escort girls, and particularly unctuous courtiers. After Eton, Coleridge did a stint as a trainee reporter on the comedically named Falmouth Packet, after which he went to Cambridge University where, though ostensibly studying history of art, he enjoyed a regime of \u201cfull-on time wasting\u201d. A dedicated fan of David Bowie, he coloured his hair bright orange, and took lessons from the singer\u2019s mime tutor Lindsay Kemp, in the hope of either meeting his hero, or Kate Bush, in class. During the holidays, he interned at Harpers &amp; Queen, and went travelling with, among others, his friend Craig Brown. These adventures were sometimes grubby (he hitchhiked across eastern Turkey), and sometimes swanky (in Paris, he met the former Diana Mitford, widow of the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley; the thing that sticks in his mind about the encounter was that she told him she used to keep her own hand cream in the ladies\u2019 powder room at Claridge\u2019s). He was awarded something called an aegrotat degree \u2013 this is basically Latin for sick note \u2013 because, having hurt his back in Yazd, in Iran, he was in hospital and unable to sit his exams. The week he left Cambridge he read in the Evening Standard that Tina Brown had been appointed the editor of the ailing Tatler, and he duly wrote to her, asking for a job. His interview took place in the kitchen of the house she shared with her boyfriend (now husband), Harry Evans, the editor of the Sunday Times, where she was busy staring at a load of photographs of the 18th birthday party of the Duke of Rutland\u2019s daughter, Lady Theresa Manners, at Belvoir Castle. \u201cDo you know who any of these chinless characters are?\u201d she asked him. He did. In fact, he\u2019d been at the party himself. \u201cI need a headline,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething snappy.\u201d Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

Sure the #bigbigsound was a cultural force as much as it was a hashtag, but Pickett is the story of the 2019 grand final</p> <p> \u2013 not just on a personal level, but for what it says about the Richmond Football Club.</p> <p>In May this year, Richmond used its only pick (number 13 overall) in the 2019 mid-season rookie draft to select a 27-year-old midfielder from South Fremantle. Pickett was twice South Fremantle\u2019s club champion and impressed during last year\u2019s WAFL finals series, particularly in the qualifying final against West Perth when he touched the ball 26 times and kicked four goals. His is a resume that makes the Tigers\u2019 pick a somewhat straightforward one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/28/richmond-tigers-full-of-emotion-in-grand-final-celebrations\">Richmond Tigers full of emotion in grand final celebrations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Pickett also played for an amateur football side at the Wooroloo Prison Farm after being charged with burglary-related offences in 2010.</p> <p>Footballers overcome all sorts of hardships to win a premiership, but in Australia there are few obstacles as big as being a blackfella with a criminal record, fated to forever be judged by your past and the colour of your skin. When he was overlooked in 2018\u2019s AFL and rookie drafts, the quiet father of four\u2019s cards appeared marked.</p> <p>But this era of the Richmond club has come about from not conforming to stereotypes. And selecting a mature-aged recruit with only four months in the AFL system to be the first player to debut in a VFL/AFL grand final in 67 years - and only the sixth ever - is to differentiate from the mean. Even considering his Norm Goss Medal for the best player on the ground in the grand final win over Williamstown it was a risk that not many clubs would take.</p> <p>In many ways, Pickett\u2019s selection represents these Tigers \u2013 a club that is prepared to take a punt, have faith and back their players in.

      "bodyText": "Before the ball was bounced, Marlion Pickett was the story when he became the sixth player to debut in an VFL/AFL senior grand final \u2013 the first in 67 years. Sure the #bigbigsound was a cultural force as much as it was a hashtag, but Pickett is the story of the 2019 grand final \u2013 not just on a personal level, but for what it says about the Richmond Football Club. In May this year, Richmond used its only pick (number 13 overall) in the 2019 mid-season rookie draft to select a 27-year-old midfielder from South Fremantle. Pickett was twice South Fremantle\u2019s club champion and impressed during last year\u2019s WAFL finals series, particularly in the qualifying final against West Perth when he touched the ball 26 times and kicked four goals. His is a resume that makes the Tigers\u2019 pick a somewhat straightforward one. But Pickett also played for an amateur football side at the Wooroloo Prison Farm after being charged with burglary-related offences in 2010. Footballers overcome all sorts of hardships to win a premiership, but in Australia there are few obstacles as big as being a blackfella with a criminal record, fated to forever be judged by your past and the colour of your skin. When he was overlooked in 2018\u2019s AFL and rookie drafts, the quiet father of four\u2019s cards appeared marked. But this era of the Richmond club has come about from not conforming to stereotypes. And selecting a mature-aged recruit with only four months in the AFL system to be the first player to debut in a VFL/AFL grand final in 67 years - and only the sixth ever - is to differentiate from the mean. Even considering his Norm Goss Medal for the best player on the ground in the grand final win over Williamstown it was a risk that not many clubs would take. In many ways, Pickett\u2019s selection represents these Tigers \u2013 a club that is prepared to take a punt, have faith and back their players in. They are a club, and a coach, that has learnt to let go and to enjoy their football. And to watch Marlion Pickett play, is to enjoy football. Richmond defender Dylan Grimes told SEN that Pickett reminded him of Andrew McLeod. And early in the second quarter, it didn\u2019t seem so hyperbolic when Pickett got the ball in the middle, spun and glided around the Giants\u2019 Lachie Whitfield as if the wind had blown him there before setting up Jason Castagna. Pickett is as smooth as jazz, but scratch him and you may nick a vein of a man who has had to compete like hell for everything he has got. Pickett\u2019s statistics on Saturday were impressive enough \u2013 22 possessions, nine score involvements, a goal and 559 metres gained (only Castagna and Nick Vlastuin had more) but it was something that cannot be measured - his composure in his AFL debut in front of more than 100,000 people - that was simply remarkable. Pickett has only played one game, but it was the one game of the year where you can find out in a single afternoon who a footballer really is, and every member of the crowd walked away from the MCG astounded by what they just saw. And for this we owe a debt of thanks to Damien Hardwick. After a disastrous 2016 season, the Richmond mentor came to understand that he had perhaps coached his players to be a little too cautious and to hide their footballing light under a bushel. Hardwick today is a coach that while methodical (and his coaching from quarter-time onwards was evident of this) is a man who appears to say, \u201clet\u2019s have fun and give ourselves something to remember.\u201d Richmond fans now have two premierships that they will never forget. For those of us who aren\u2019t Tigers fans, Marlion Pickett\u2019s performance has given us something we will always remember from a grand final where the scoreline could have made it one we\u2019d easily neglect. After just one game, Pickett is a premiership player and a Richmond life member. He has also played a game that nobody who saw it will forget \u2013 not even Giants fans\u2026 particularly Giants fans. He is forever a part of football folklore. That is the story.",

      "bodyText": "In the end, as ecstatic Japanese rugby fans celebrated their team\u2019s first victory over Ireland on Saturday, it was left to a retired warrior from the losing side to offer a sense of perspective. \u201cThis tournament needed a second-tier nation to beat a first-tier nation and this was no fluke,\u201d said the former Irish wing Shane Horgan. \u201cThey thoroughly deserved it, out-played Ireland \u2013 all of a sudden, this tournament becomes very, very tricky for Ireland.\u201d And very, very interesting for the host nation. The Brave Blossoms\u2019 stunning 19-12 win over a side that ranked world number one just a few weeks ago has electrified the Rugby World Cup, with international stars quick to pay tribute on social media. \u201cWhat have we just witnessed?\u201d the former Welsh wing Shane Williams asked on Twitter. \u201cOne of the performances of the tournament so far!\u201d The England legend Jason Robinson declared: \u201cThey\u2019ve only gone and done it again!!!! Huge well done to @JRFURugby.\u201d In Tokyo, as the final whistle blew some 180km away in Shizuoka, fans drank in the magnitude of their team\u2019s performance, a victory that eclipsed the defeat of Fiji by unfancied Uruguay on Wednesday, another shock result that the game\u2019s supporters hope will attract new converts. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we stood any chance of winning before the match,\u201d said Kazuyuki Imano, an IT worker who played rugby at high school. \u201cBut we\u2019ve won. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Those who recalled the \u201cBrighton miracle\u201d, Japan\u2019s epic victory over South Africa in the last Rugby World Cup, said this weekend\u2019s \u201cShizuoka shock\u201d surpassed even the heroics of four years ago. Several predicted that the game would reap dividends in Japan, if the team were able to build on their historic victory. \u201cThis is much bigger,\u201d said Takuya Sato, a longtime rugby fan who faced Japan\u2019s winger Kotaro Matsushima as a high school player. \u201cOnce the tournament is over, rugby fever might subside a bit. But if Japan reach the quarter-finals, it will be a huge boost for the sport here.\u201d TV networks flashed the result, while, in bars around Japan\u2019s capital, seasoned rugby fans and recent converts exchanged high fives and hugs, with some cheekily ordering rounds of Guinness to celebrate. Social media sites were overrun with video clips of the match, with some voicing mixed feelings about the result. Oona McGee, a half-Japanese Australian who lives in Tokyo, tweeted: \u201cJoy and sorrow but what a match! Brilliant play by Japan.\u201d The tournament\u2019s official Japan-language account posted a clip of prop Keita Inagaki in tears after the final whistle.

His friend Hidenari Shiromizu said the drama in Shizuoka had truly brought the competition to life for home supporters, just over a week after an error-prone Japan beat Russia in the tournament\u2019s opening fixture. \u201cI was three years old when the first Rugby World Cup was held,\u201d Shiromizu said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s here \u2026 and this has happened.\u201d Most pundits expected Ireland to prevail over Japan, but Japan\u2019s coach, Jamie Joseph, said his side had gone into the match with only victory in mind. \u201cWe\u2019re ecstatic about the result,\u201d the New Zealander said. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the players, we had a plan.

      "bodyText": "During his days as Newcastle\u2019s manager, Rafa Ben\u00edtez often discussed the problems of sleeping beneath a \u201cshort blanket\u201d, frequently lamenting the impossibility of keeping both his neck and feet warm. It did not take a genius to deduce that Steve Bruce\u2019s predecessor was not really talking about deficient bedding but deploying a diplomatic metaphor to emphasise his struggles to make the most of insufficient resources at St James\u2019 Park. Ben\u00edtez\u2019s way of making Newcastle appear more than the sum of their parts was to implement a possession-light, counterattacking approach big on shape and structure which left his team hard to beat. Bruce is attempting to make that framework a little more flexible and, by upping the possession and particularly the pass-completion statistics, provide increased scope for creativity and improvisation. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll improve,\u201d he maintains as he prepares for Sunday\u2019s tricky trip to Leicester. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep surrendering the ball; we\u2019ve got to cross it more, we\u2019ve got to create more chances.\u201d Few fans would disagree yet such philosophical transitions often prove uncomfortable and sometimes downright dangerous. At times this season Bruce\u2019s XI\u2019s have looked as unconvincing as the latest Peter Kenyon-led attempted takeover at St James\u2019 Park. Although Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor is convinced that, unless his players become more comfortable and fluent on the ball, they will continually be involved in relegation skirmishes, altering the squad\u2019s deeply ingrained counterattacking mindset is much easier said than done. With Bruce having won only one Premier League game since taking charge \u2013 albeit at Tottenham \u2013 and average home attendances down by almost 10,000, he could probably have done without reporters overhearing a comment from Isaac Hayden last Saturday. It was 30 minutes into the goalless draw against Brighton when the midfielder approached the technical area and told his manager: \u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d At present Bruce\u2019s every tactical tweak \u2013 and so far they have amounted to experimenting with 3-5-2, modifying Ben\u00edtez\u2019s 3-4-3 and attempting to press higher up the pitch \u2013 appears freighted with risk. Already he has learned that attempting to build everything around Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s languid playmaking skills does not work. The task is further complicated by last season\u2019s top scorers, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and Ayoze P\u00e9rez, having left a club also missing the similarly departed Mo Diam\u00e9\u2019s influential midfield heft. Granted, the \u00a340m Brazilian striker Joelinton has arrived but the 23-year-old is struggling to adapt to a new Premier League habitat, as is the \u00a316.5m former Nice winger Allan Saint-Maximin, 22.

While P\u00e9rez joined Leicester for \u00a330m, Rond\u00f3n was reunited with Ben\u00edtez at China\u2019s Dalian Yifang after Newcastle balked at paying \u00a316m to turn a 30-year-old\u2019s loan into a permanent deal.

      "body": "<p>In the end there was no way through, in part because no one was particularly desperate to find it. Another derby ended in another draw, allowing Real Madrid to remain top and Atl\u00e9tico to remain a solitary point behind them.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have clear chances and nor did they: neither of us risked very much,\u201d Jan Oblak said at the final whistle, pretty much saying it all. Between them, these sides spent almost \u20ac600m in the summer but they produced a game of few clear-cut opportunities that came to a goalless conclusion.</p> <p>The last time these teams had met, it had finished 7-2 to Atl\u00e9tico in New Jersey. \u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d Zidane had said then. Everyone knew it would be different this time and so it turned out. This was tighter, tenser, and meant more; a fact highlighted by the inclusion of Fede Valverde in Real\u2019s midfield in place of James Rodr\u00edguez. Afterwards Zidane suggested that defensive solidity was his priority. This was a battle for control which no one really won \u2013 at least not when it came to the ball \u2013 but no one lost either.</p> <p>If there was a broad first-half pattern it ran: Atl\u00e9tico, Real, Atl\u00e9tico. Joao Felix shot wide when Diego Costa sent him clear. Harmless shots from Karim Benzema, Nacho and Toni Kroos drew three corners in little over a minute. Kroos then took the ball beautifully on the bounce before bending a shot from 20 yards that Jan Oblak dived to push away. There was little, though, from the two biggest signings: Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix and Eden Hazard.</p> <p>Thomas Partey was the game\u2019s outstanding midfielder. Displaying a range of passing that was not always reciprocated by those around him, he sent a superb ball across the six-yard box which Costa couldn\u2019t reach. Kieran Trippier was another of the night\u2019s most impressive performers, sought early and often by his team-mates.</p> <p>Thomas teed up Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix to shoot wide from the edge of the area and then his superb pass found Trippier in the area. Options didn\u2019t open up for the Englishman with the speed he hoped and Thibaut Courtois stopped his low ball reaching Koke. </p> <p>Diego Simeone made his first change at the break, \u00c1ngel Correa replacing Vitolo and immediately dashing in to head over from Costa\u2019s chipped pass. Correa brought electricity but not much clarity and it was Real who had the clearest chance of the night when Hazard found Nacho overlapping. Nacho\u2019s cutback ran towards Gareth Bale, thundering into the area and the perfect shooting position. He opened his body and hit the ball high into the south end, the roar from the fans there speaking of relief. At the other end, Trippier\u2019s cross \u2013 his ninth \u2013 only just evaded Costa.</p> <p>Both sides made changes, albeit without running excessive risks.

      "bodyText": "In the end there was no way through, in part because no one was particularly desperate to find it. Another derby ended in another draw, allowing Real Madrid to remain top and Atl\u00e9tico to remain a solitary point behind them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have clear chances and nor did they: neither of us risked very much,\u201d Jan Oblak said at the final whistle, pretty much saying it all. Between them, these sides spent almost \u20ac600m in the summer but they produced a game of few clear-cut opportunities that came to a goalless conclusion. The last time these teams had met, it had finished 7-2 to Atl\u00e9tico in New Jersey. \u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d Zidane had said then. Everyone knew it would be different this time and so it turned out. This was tighter, tenser, and meant more; a fact highlighted by the inclusion of Fede Valverde in Real\u2019s midfield in place of James Rodr\u00edguez. Afterwards Zidane suggested that defensive solidity was his priority. This was a battle for control which no one really won \u2013 at least not when it came to the ball \u2013 but no one lost either. If there was a broad first-half pattern it ran: Atl\u00e9tico, Real, Atl\u00e9tico. Joao Felix shot wide when Diego Costa sent him clear. Harmless shots from Karim Benzema, Nacho and Toni Kroos drew three corners in little over a minute. Kroos then took the ball beautifully on the bounce before bending a shot from 20 yards that Jan Oblak dived to push away. There was little, though, from the two biggest signings: Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix and Eden Hazard. Thomas Partey was the game\u2019s outstanding midfielder. Displaying a range of passing that was not always reciprocated by those around him, he sent a superb ball across the six-yard box which Costa couldn\u2019t reach. Kieran Trippier was another of the night\u2019s most impressive performers, sought early and often by his team-mates. Thomas teed up Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix to shoot wide from the edge of the area and then his superb pass found Trippier in the area. Options didn\u2019t open up for the Englishman with the speed he hoped and Thibaut Courtois stopped his low ball reaching Koke. Diego Simeone made his first change at the break, \u00c1ngel Correa replacing Vitolo and immediately dashing in to head over from Costa\u2019s chipped pass. Correa brought electricity but not much clarity and it was Real who had the clearest chance of the night when Hazard found Nacho overlapping. Nacho\u2019s cutback ran towards Gareth Bale, thundering into the area and the perfect shooting position. He opened his body and hit the ball high into the south end, the roar from the fans there speaking of relief. At the other end, Trippier\u2019s cross \u2013 his ninth \u2013 only just evaded Costa. Both sides made changes, albeit without running excessive risks. Lemar, Modri\u0107, Llorente and James were introduced but it had little affect on the direction of the game, something both teams seemed to accept and embrace as time ticked away. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to go mad, throwing everything forward,\u201d Courtois said. Sa\u00fal headed Koke\u2019s corner just past the post. Thomas, Correa and Trippier combined to reach the byline but Koke couldn\u2019t turn the shot goalwards at the near post. And that was just about that, Zidane not unjustly saying: \u201cWe didn\u2019t allow a single chance.\u201d The closest anyone came was Benzema, whose header from Nacho\u2019s cross found Oblak diving full length to make a sharp save.",

There have been some monstrous Madrid derbies in the Simeone years. This isn\u2019t quite at the top of the list - it\u2019s not a Champions League final for a start - but it does feel bigger than usual. Not only will the winner, if there is one, overtake Granada and go top of La Liga; they will also make a statement of title-winning intent.</p> <p>With the usual champions Barcelona looking vulnerable away from home, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/28/european-roundup-barcelona-luis-suarez-bayern-munich-juventus\">today\u2019s victory at Getafe notwithstanding</a>, there is at least the potential for a new winner of La Liga. </p> <p>In the meantime, it never hurts to turn over your local rivals. For Atletico, who plugged Real 7-3 in a pre-season match in New Jersey, victory would be especially sweet. They have won only once at home to Real in the league in the last 20 years, but they go into tonight\u2019s match in fine mood. Whatever happens, Saturday night in Madrid will not be dull.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 8pm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/26/rodrygo-and-the-ilusion-of-la-liga-21st-century-boys\">Rodrygo and the 'ilusi\u00f3n' of La Liga's 21st-century boys | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T18:40:52.314Z\">at 7.40pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Sid Lowe\u2019s match report. The Madrid derby ends in an honourable draw. It was a fairly uneventful game, although Jan Oblak made one outstanding save from Karim Benzema. Thomas Partey and Toni Kroos were great in midfield, but both attacks struggled. Thanks for your company - goodnight. Peep peep! 90+2 min Diego Costa is limping heavily. Atletico have used all their subs. 90+1 min There will be three minutes of added time. 90 min Diego Costa\u2019s looping header, from Lemar\u2019s corner, is easily claimed by Courtois. 89 min A draw would be a fair result. There has been very little between the sides. 88 min Luka Jovic comes on for Real to replace Karim Benzema. 87 min Real are finishing the stronger, although Atletico look as solid defensively as ever. Nacho shoots over from 35 yards. 85 min \u201cThomas has been quite great, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d says Ruth Purdue. He looks so good. Apparently his release clause is 50m euros, which is absurd. He would improve pretty much every team in the world. 82 min Thomas plays a cute pass into Correa, who spins Ramos neatly and finds Trippier on the right. His fast cross is volleyed wide by Koke, just in front of the near post. It was a half-chance, no more, but that was a lovely move from Atletico. Thomas has been so impressive. 81 min A draw would move Real back to the top of La Liga, a point ahead of Granada and Atletico. 78 min Atletico appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty when Angel Correa goes over after a shoulder charge from Sergio Ramos. It was a risky challenge, but not strong enough for a penalty to be given. 77 min Eden Hazard, who looks shattered, is replaced by James Rodriguez. 75 min: Brilliant save from Oblak! Real kept the ball for an age, moving it left and right. Eventually Nacho whipped an inswinging cross towards the penalty spot, where Benzema rose highest to flick a beautifully timed header towards the bottom corner. Oblak plunged to his left and stretched to make a desperate save with his left hand. He is such a good shot-stopper. 72 min Saul\u2019s flicked header, from Koke\u2019s near-post corner, flashes just over the bar. That was a fine effort. 71 min Bale stabs a superb pass to find Modric on the right of the area. He drives an even better low cross that flies across the six-yard box and behind for a goalkick. Real needed a six-yard sniffer like Micky Quinn there; instead they had Karim Benzema lurking on the fringes. 70 min That\u2019s Joao Felix\u2019s last touch - he\u2019s replaced by the former Real player Marcos Llorente. 69 min Varane is booked for sending Joao Felix to the canvas with a nasty tackle from behind. 68 min Real bring on Luka Modric for Fede Valverde. 67 min Kroos drives a long pass to Carvajal, who wins a corner off Saul. Real make a complete Horlicks of the corner. 63 min Kroos is needlessly fouled by Partey, 30 yards from goal. The free-kick is slightly to the left of centre ... and Casemiro bullets it over the bar. 61 min Another Atletico change - Thomas Lemar replaces Renan Lodi, so Saul goes to left-back. 57 min: Bale misses Real\u2019s best chance! Hazard played a nice pass down the left to Nacho, who screwed a low cross into the area. It was behind Benzema but ran perfectly into the path of Bale, who walloped a first-time shot into orbit from 15 yards. 55 min Bale has a pop from 30 yards. Goal kick. 53 min Benzema and Bale look well off the pace. Hazard has been threatening, and Kroos has played with his usual unobtrusive excellence, but that aside Real haven\u2019t offered much in the final third. 51 min For the umpteenth time tonight, Thomas drives a long pass to find Trippier in space. His cross is blocked. Thomas has had a storming game; his passing, short and long, has been especially good. 49 min Atletico have started the second half strongly. Costa flips a neat pass over the defence to find the substitute Correa, who mistimes a header that goes well wide. It was a half chance at best. 47 min Apparently Simeone was fuming because Sergio Ramos abused the assistant referee. Simeone claims Ramos used the same phrase - about defecating on his \u201cprostitute mother\u201d - that got Diego Costa an eight-match ban last season. 46 min Peep peep! Real begin the second half. Atletico have made a substitution, with Angel Correa replacing Vitolo. Diego Simeone wasn\u2019t sent off, though he was told off by the referee for something or other. Half-time reading Peep peep! There is a suggestion that Diego Simeone has been sent off by the referee. As for the football, it was a relatively uneventful half, with no clear chances for either side. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 44 min Another fine pass from Thomas allows Trippier to surge into a huge gap on the right wing. He looks up, considers his options and threads a low cross towards Koke, lurking in front of an open goal at the far post. Courtois dives to his right to palm the ball away at full stretch. It won\u2019t go down as a save but that was a superb and vital bit of goalkeeping. 40 min Kroos works Oblak again from distance, this time with a low, first-time curler. I think it would have hit the outside of the post but Oblak played safe, palming it behind for a corner. 39 min After lovely play from Thomas, Joao Felix cracks a fine low shot from 20 yards that flashes just wide of the far post. 38 min That, in fact, was the first shot on target in the match. It hasn\u2019t been a classic. 37 min Kroos\u2019s sudden long-range shot is saved at the second attempt by Oblak, sprawling to his left. It was a decent save, no more or less. 33 min Vitolo wins a corner for Atletico, who are having a good little spell. Trippier whips it towards the near post and it\u2019s headed away. 30 min Thomas, found by Trippier on the right, drives a stunning low cross that flashes right across the six-yard box. The stretching Diego Costa just failed to reach it in front of an open goal, and then got up appealing for a penalty. There was nothing in it. 27 min Real win three corners in the space of 30 seconds. The third, from Kroos, is noggined away by Trippier. 26 min Real are looking increasingly dangerous, especially on the counter-attack. Atletico need Diego Costa to pick a fight to get the crowd going again. 24 min \u201c\u2018Ramos leaves a snide one on Diego Costa\u2019, you say?\u201d sniffs Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019m surprised. It\u2019s not like either of those two to get involved in any poo-housery. Also, Martin Blank is very much the ideal I aspire to. In my top five films. Genius.\u201d It\u2019s in my top three, so I win. Bing bing bang, popcorn that. 23 min A gorgeous pass from Valverde releases Hazard on the left. He moves into the area, slips Savic and hits a cross that takes a deflection and goes behind for a corner on the other side. 22 min Nacho is booked for flattening Trippier. 17 min Nacho\u2019s inswinging cross is headed behind by Lodi, under a lot of pressure from Bale. A goalkick is given but I\u2019m sure the last touch was Lodi\u2019s. 16 min Diego Simeone is patrolling the touchline, dressed like Martin Blank. The game hasn\u2019t really got going yet, with that half-chance for Joao Felix the only incident of note. 13 min Ramos leaves a snide one on Diego Costa, a questionable tactic with 77 minutes still to play. 12 min Real have been the better team in the last few minutes. Hazard is taking up some dangerous positions. 10 min Bale shoots from 30 yards. It\u2019s a mess. 9 min Real are fuming that Trippier has not been booked for a cynical foul on Hazard, and rightly so. Mind you, Ramos should have been booked a few minutes ago as well. 8 min The first chance for Atletico. Diego Costa, in his own half, lobs a simple ball through the inside-right channel for Joao Felix. He scoots into the area, far too quick for Sergio Ramos, but the angle is fairly tight and he drags his shot wide of the far post. 7 min Real have their first spell of possession in the Atletico half. You don\u2019t need to be looking at the screen to know when Sergio Ramos is on the ball. 6 min Trippier is back on and seems okay. Real have been camped in their half since the match started. I\u2019m sure they have crossed the halfway line, but I can\u2019t remember it. 5 min Joao Felix slips Sergio Ramos with a lovely nutmeg and is flattened for his impudence. Ramos waves him to his feet, but it was a clear foul and he should probably have been booked. 5 min It was an accidental challenge from Hazard, who was looking the other way and had no idea Trippier was behind him. 4 min Trippier is down after the backpedalling Hazard landed on his right foot. This doesn\u2019t look good. 2 min Trippier\u2019s first involvement in a Madrid derby is a cross from the right that is volleyed away by Sergio Ramos. Real haven\u2019t crossed the halfway line yet. 1 min Peep peep! Atletico get the match under way, kicking from left to right. There\u2019s a glorious noise all around the Metropolitano Stadium as the players emerge from the tunnel. Atletico Madrid (4-4-2) Oblak; Trippier, Savic, Gimenez, Renan Lodi; Saul, Thomas, Koke, Vitolo; Joao Felix, Diego Costa. Substitutes: Herrera, Lemar, Arias, Felipe, Adan, Llorente, Correa. Real Madrid (4-3-3) Courtois; Carvajal, Ramos, Varane, Nacho; Kroos, Casemiro, Valverde; Bale, Benzema, Hazard. Substitutes: Eder Militao, Vinicius, Areola, Jovic, James, Modric, Lucas Vazquez. Hello. There have been some monstrous Madrid derbies in the Simeone years. This isn\u2019t quite at the top of the list - it\u2019s not a Champions League final for a start - but it does feel bigger than usual. Not only will the winner, if there is one, overtake Granada and go top of La Liga; they will also make a statement of title-winning intent. With the usual champions Barcelona looking vulnerable away from home, today\u2019s victory at Getafe notwithstanding, there is at least the potential for a new winner of La Liga. In the meantime, it never hurts to turn over your local rivals. For Atletico, who plugged Real 7-3 in a pre-season match in New Jersey, victory would be especially sweet. They have won only once at home to Real in the league in the last 20 years, but they go into tonight\u2019s match in fine mood. Whatever happens, Saturday night in Madrid will not be dull. Kick off is at 8pm.",

      "body": "<p>When Boris Johnson\u2019s plane took off from Heathrow at 6pm last Sunday, No 10 officials seemed as relaxed as at any time since they entered Downing Street in late July. They were about to fly 3,500 miles away from the national crisis over Brexit to the UN general assembly in New York, hoping, no doubt, for some respite.</p> <p>Happily for them, the centre of the Brexit storm had settled for the time being over Brighton, where Labour\u2019s annual conference had opened disastrously. Allies of Jeremy Corbyn had mounted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/tom-watson-plan-to-remove-me-as-deputy-leader-is-drive-by-shooting\" title=\"\">a coup attempt</a> against his deputy, Tom Watson, only for Corbyn to have to call off the assassins as uproar among moderates ensued.</p> <p>As if the failed plot to oust Watson \u2013 and the unsuccessful attempt to abolish his job \u2013 had not been messy enough as a curtain-raiser, Corbyn was then pitched into a battle with party members and key figures in his own shadow cabinet as they manoeuvred against him, trying to tie their leader to an explicitly pro-Remain Brexit policy, which Corbyn was opposing tooth and nail.</p> <p>Throughout Sunday the talk in Brighton\u2019s hotel bars was not about Johnson\u2019s Brexit troubles and whether Labour could beat him in a general election, but of Labour\u2019s own civil war and how much longer Corbyn could survive.</p> <p>Not long into the flight, and just as delegates in Brighton were agreeing to force a vote aimed at defeating Corbyn on Brexit, the prime minister\u2019s aides agreed to a request from journalists for an early on-board chat with the PM. Before dinner was served, Johnson emerged from the first-class section, clutching a glass of Diet Coke and with a cheery \u201cHow are you? Good to see you all\u201d.</p> <p>The question and answer session was by no means plain sailing. Johnson was grilled about whether his ministers could have done more to save the travel firm Thomas Cook from collapse. He also faced six questions \u2013 all which he declined to answer \u2013 on his links to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/27/boris-johnson-referred-to-police-watchdog-over-potential-misconduct\" title=\"\">US tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri</a>. But he relished discussion of Labour\u2019s infighting, and ridiculed the party\u2019s attack on private schools, such as his own alma mater, Eton. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary they have excavated this from the crypt of what I thought had been long-buried socialist ideology,\u201d he said. While his predecessor Theresa May disliked such encounters intensely and wanted to cut them short, Johnson wanted more, twice allowing reporters to extend the session, despite the mild protests of his officials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri in July 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri in July 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Innotech Network/YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following afternoon, however, choruses of \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d rang out from the Brighton conference floor. Union leaders, including Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey, were on their feet, applauding deliriously. A majority of Labour members, delegates and MPs might have wanted Labour to campaign for Remain \u2013 but Corbyn had just proved that his people still controlled the levers of power, the ones that run the party machine. With the Corbynites dominating the national executive committee, and with the help of key unions and Momentum, Corbyn had just seen off the biggest broad-based revolt in his time as leader. There were claims of a \u201cstitch-up\u201d from some in the Labour Remain camp, but Corbyn had won \u2013 and against the odds.</p> <p>If his victories in three successive Brexit votes came as a huge fillip to Corbyn\u2019s supporters, it was as nothing compared with the lift they would receive next morning. It was 5.30am New York time (10.30am UK time). Johnson was in his hotel room with his TV switched on and away from his officials, awaiting the ruling of 11 supreme court judges in London. They were about to pronounce on the lawfulness or otherwise of his decision to shut down parliament for five weeks from mid-September, a move Johnson had claimed was to allow time to prepare for a Queen\u2019s speech, but which everyone knew was really to stop MPs trying to find ways to block a no-deal Brexit. Lady Hale, the court\u2019s president, began slowly and, with every sentence, it became clearer where she was heading.</p> <p>The judges in the highest court in the land were unanimous, she said. The government had not given adequate reasons, let alone good reasons, for shutting parliament down. Parliament existed to hold the executive to account but had been prevented from doing so without good cause. The Queen had been misled. \u201cThis court has \u2026 concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to her majesty [to suspend parliament] was unlawful, void and of no effect,\u201d Hale said. \u201cThis means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abf970dd3cd1c775c62c66f6b63f8b246d76fce5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abf970dd3cd1c775c62c66f6b63f8b246d76fce5/60_84_1660_996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Hale delivers the supreme court\u2019s verdict on the proroguing of parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Hale delivers the supreme court\u2019s verdict on the proroguing of parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supreme Court/HANDOUT HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She continued: \u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible.It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p> <p>As the media in New York pestered No 10 officials for a response, staff desperately prepared their lines and rearranged schedules.</p> <p>Johnson was due to make a breakfast speech to business people at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/09/hudson-yards-new-york-25bn-architectural-fiasco\" title=\"\">Hudson Yards</a> development in New York. But before doing so he appeared in a series of television interviews, striking a careful but defiant tone. \u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear that we respect the judiciary in our country and we respect the court. I disagree profoundly with what they had to say.\u201d No 10 staff told the travelling UK journalists that they would still be allowed to watch the early-morning speech but issued stern warnings that there would be no questions.</p> <p>After Johnson was ushered away for a hectic schedule of talks at the UN building, including a one-to-one with President Trump, his team worked on the logistics of an early return to the UK immediately after the prime minister had addressed the UN later that day. It was announced that parliament would resume the next day and that Johnson would address MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae7e8dceca093c83673de416fc5c4d177046bf83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae7e8dceca093c83673de416fc5c4d177046bf83/0_14_4716_2829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn called for Johnson to resign in his conference speech.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn called for Johnson to resign in his conference speech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corbyn brought his conference speech forward to Tuesday afternoon. To loud cheers and calls of \u201cJohnson out\u201d, he raised the roof by calling on the prime minister to resign. \u201cHe thought he could do what he liked, just as he always does. He thinks he is above us all. He is part of an elite that disdains democracy. He is not fit to be prime minister.\u201d </p> <p>The Labour conference that had opened with the party in turmoil ended on a high with belief restored. On Johnson\u2019s hurriedly rescheduled return flight to London there was a decidedly different atmosphere to the cheeriness of the outward journey, with no chat with the PM for journalists and the entire No 10 contingent staying at the front of the aircraft, well away from the press.</p> <p>Colleagues, welcome back to our place of work,\u201d declared Commons Speaker John Bercow at 11.30am on Wednesday as parliament was reopened. Bercow emphasised with evident glee that the item in the official journal of parliament relating to the prorogation had been \u201cexxxxpunged\u201d. MPs had returned to Westminster that morning asking themselves what on earth Johnson would do now. Would he resign? Or would he somehow try to turn the ruling of the supreme court to his and the Tories\u2019 political advantage, by using it as evidence that it was not only parliament that was trying to block his path to delivering Brexit on time, but now the courts, too?</p> <p>Whatever path he took, it was clear even to Tory MPs that the prorogation had backfired terribly as a way of trying to push through Brexit on 31 October. In the days before parliament was shut down earlier this month, MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit had reacted to the pending closure by rushing through legislation that would mandate the prime minister to ask for a Brexit extension if no deal had been reached with the EU by 19 October. Johnson, who had campaigned for the leadership of the Tory party on a promise not to delay, had reacted by saying that, despite the new law, the UK would leave at the end of next month, come what may. And No 10 officials briefed that they would attempt to find ways around the law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c140b702fa5a868febd19d3dc487479674e403c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c140b702fa5a868febd19d3dc487479674e403c/0_42_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commons Speaker John Bercow returns to reopen the house on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commons Speaker John Bercow returns to reopen the house on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what now? Could Johnson really risk another confrontation with the courts by ignoring, or trying to circumvent, that legislation? Tensions at the highest levels of government over how to respond to the supreme court ruling were quickly exposed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/25/geoffrey-cox-tells-mps-this-parliament-is-dead-video\" title=\"\">the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, rose to his feet to make a statement</a> on his legal opinion of the court\u2019s judgment. Overnight, it had been reported that the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had described the court\u2019s decision as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d, a comment that Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn raised with Cox. Did he agree? Was the government ready collectively to turn on the court? With Rees-Mogg sitting a few places away from him, Cox rapidly contradicted his cabinet colleague.</p> <p>\u201cI do not think that it was a constitutional coup. I know that the right honourable gentleman will know that I do not and I do not believe anybody does.\u201d Rees-Mogg twitched his left eyebrow nervously. Cox\u2019s tone, when speaking about the legal judgment, was reasoned and measured. But later he turned suddenly from eloquent lawyer into political rottweiler, revealing what was clearly going to be the government tactic. Cox turned on parliament, saying it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that MPs had \u201cblocked\u201d the will of the 17.4 million people who had voted Leave. If as a lawyer he could not attack the courts, he seemed more than willing to go after MPs instead. \u201cThis parliament is a dead parliament,\u201d Cox roared. \u201cIt should no longer sit, it has no moral authority to sit on these green benches.\u201d</p> <p>The temperature was rising. It was not only opposition MPs who were outraged. Cox\u2019s former cabinet colleague Amber Rudd rose to protest at what she saw as dangerous language, condemning Cox and saying a Brexit solution should be sought above all else. \u201cMay I ask the attorney general to work with colleagues to try to find a compromise and to cease this language of pitting parliament against the people?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d2445a6224706f447c789875c9e71e0276f25ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d2445a6224706f447c789875c9e71e0276f25ce/0_340_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geoffrey Cox lashes out at the opposition after the supreme court judgment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geoffrey Cox lashes out at the opposition after the supreme court judgment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time Johnson entered the Commons later that day, to a chorus of \u201cresign\u201d from the opposition, it was clear not only that he would do no such thing, but that the government was now bent on turning the country against parliament and, more subtly, the courts. Making only fleeting reference to the supreme court ruling, and refusing to apologise for misleading the Queen, Johnson instead attacked opposition MPs for threatening Brexit by passing what he called the \u201csurrender act\u201d \u2013 the legislation that would force him to seek an extension to the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. His tone was contemptuous, his language often provocative and bellicose.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern reminded the house of the murder by a rightwing extremist of her colleague Jo Cox during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016 and said the PM\u2019s use of words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201ccapitulation\u201d was dangerous and that the mood in the country was \u201cgetting toxic\u201d. \u201cWill he promise to change?\u201d she asked. What reason would anyone have to respect the law if the prime minister could describe the supreme court as \u201cwrong\u201d, refuse to apologise and insult parliament, MPs asked.</p> <p>Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/25/outrage-as-boris-johnson-dismisses-dangers-of-inflammatory-language-as-humbug-video\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff</a>, whose Dewsbury seat is close to that of the late Jo Cox, rose to her feet, her face taut with rage. \u201cWe stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day. Let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2013 surrender act, betrayal, traitor \u2013 and I, for one, am sick of it \u2026 he should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d Johnson was dismissive and unmoved. \u201cI have to say I have never heard such humbug in all my life,\u201d he declared, before being drowned out by cries of \u201cShame!\u201d, prompting Bercow to intervene and call for calm.</p> <p>The next day, Johnson\u2019s sister, the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2019/sep/26/boris-johnson-sister-says-jo-cox-remarks-tasteless-video\" title=\"\">Rachel Johnson, joined those condemning the prime minister</a>. \u201cI think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u2018Britain first,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4 million votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered.

The SNP began to push the idea of holding a vote of confidence with the aim of ousting Johnson and installing a temporary government that would ask for the delay to Brexit, then call a general election.

      "bodyText": "When Boris Johnson\u2019s plane took off from Heathrow at 6pm last Sunday, No 10 officials seemed as relaxed as at any time since they entered Downing Street in late July. They were about to fly 3,500 miles away from the national crisis over Brexit to the UN general assembly in New York, hoping, no doubt, for some respite. Happily for them, the centre of the Brexit storm had settled for the time being over Brighton, where Labour\u2019s annual conference had opened disastrously. Allies of Jeremy Corbyn had mounted a coup attempt against his deputy, Tom Watson, only for Corbyn to have to call off the assassins as uproar among moderates ensued. As if the failed plot to oust Watson \u2013 and the unsuccessful attempt to abolish his job \u2013 had not been messy enough as a curtain-raiser, Corbyn was then pitched into a battle with party members and key figures in his own shadow cabinet as they manoeuvred against him, trying to tie their leader to an explicitly pro-Remain Brexit policy, which Corbyn was opposing tooth and nail. Throughout Sunday the talk in Brighton\u2019s hotel bars was not about Johnson\u2019s Brexit troubles and whether Labour could beat him in a general election, but of Labour\u2019s own civil war and how much longer Corbyn could survive. Not long into the flight, and just as delegates in Brighton were agreeing to force a vote aimed at defeating Corbyn on Brexit, the prime minister\u2019s aides agreed to a request from journalists for an early on-board chat with the PM. Before dinner was served, Johnson emerged from the first-class section, clutching a glass of Diet Coke and with a cheery \u201cHow are you? Good to see you all\u201d. The question and answer session was by no means plain sailing. Johnson was grilled about whether his ministers could have done more to save the travel firm Thomas Cook from collapse. He also faced six questions \u2013 all which he declined to answer \u2013 on his links to the US tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri. But he relished discussion of Labour\u2019s infighting, and ridiculed the party\u2019s attack on private schools, such as his own alma mater, Eton. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary they have excavated this from the crypt of what I thought had been long-buried socialist ideology,\u201d he said. While his predecessor Theresa May disliked such encounters intensely and wanted to cut them short, Johnson wanted more, twice allowing reporters to extend the session, despite the mild protests of his officials. The following afternoon, however, choruses of \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d rang out from the Brighton conference floor. Union leaders, including Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey, were on their feet, applauding deliriously. A majority of Labour members, delegates and MPs might have wanted Labour to campaign for Remain \u2013 but Corbyn had just proved that his people still controlled the levers of power, the ones that run the party machine. With the Corbynites dominating the national executive committee, and with the help of key unions and Momentum, Corbyn had just seen off the biggest broad-based revolt in his time as leader. There were claims of a \u201cstitch-up\u201d from some in the Labour Remain camp, but Corbyn had won \u2013 and against the odds. If his victories in three successive Brexit votes came as a huge fillip to Corbyn\u2019s supporters, it was as nothing compared with the lift they would receive next morning. It was 5.30am New York time (10.30am UK time). Johnson was in his hotel room with his TV switched on and away from his officials, awaiting the ruling of 11 supreme court judges in London. They were about to pronounce on the lawfulness or otherwise of his decision to shut down parliament for five weeks from mid-September, a move Johnson had claimed was to allow time to prepare for a Queen\u2019s speech, but which everyone knew was really to stop MPs trying to find ways to block a no-deal Brexit. Lady Hale, the court\u2019s president, began slowly and, with every sentence, it became clearer where she was heading. The judges in the highest court in the land were unanimous, she said. The government had not given adequate reasons, let alone good reasons, for shutting parliament down. Parliament existed to hold the executive to account but had been prevented from doing so without good cause. The Queen had been misled. \u201cThis court has \u2026 concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to her majesty [to suspend parliament] was unlawful, void and of no effect,\u201d Hale said. \u201cThis means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed.\u201d She continued: \u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible.It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d As the media in New York pestered No 10 officials for a response, staff desperately prepared their lines and rearranged schedules. Johnson was due to make a breakfast speech to business people at the Hudson Yards development in New York. But before doing so he appeared in a series of television interviews, striking a careful but defiant tone. \u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear that we respect the judiciary in our country and we respect the court. I disagree profoundly with what they had to say.\u201d No 10 staff told the travelling UK journalists that they would still be allowed to watch the early-morning speech but issued stern warnings that there would be no questions. After Johnson was ushered away for a hectic schedule of talks at the UN building, including a one-to-one with President Trump, his team worked on the logistics of an early return to the UK immediately after the prime minister had addressed the UN later that day. It was announced that parliament would resume the next day and that Johnson would address MPs. Corbyn brought his conference speech forward to Tuesday afternoon. To loud cheers and calls of \u201cJohnson out\u201d, he raised the roof by calling on the prime minister to resign. \u201cHe thought he could do what he liked, just as he always does. He thinks he is above us all. He is part of an elite that disdains democracy. He is not fit to be prime minister.\u201d The Labour conference that had opened with the party in turmoil ended on a high with belief restored. On Johnson\u2019s hurriedly rescheduled return flight to London there was a decidedly different atmosphere to the cheeriness of the outward journey, with no chat with the PM for journalists and the entire No 10 contingent staying at the front of the aircraft, well away from the press. Colleagues, welcome back to our place of work,\u201d declared Commons Speaker John Bercow at 11.30am on Wednesday as parliament was reopened. Bercow emphasised with evident glee that the item in the official journal of parliament relating to the prorogation had been \u201cexxxxpunged\u201d. MPs had returned to Westminster that morning asking themselves what on earth Johnson would do now. Would he resign? Or would he somehow try to turn the ruling of the supreme court to his and the Tories\u2019 political advantage, by using it as evidence that it was not only parliament that was trying to block his path to delivering Brexit on time, but now the courts, too? Whatever path he took, it was clear even to Tory MPs that the prorogation had backfired terribly as a way of trying to push through Brexit on 31 October. In the days before parliament was shut down earlier this month, MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit had reacted to the pending closure by rushing through legislation that would mandate the prime minister to ask for a Brexit extension if no deal had been reached with the EU by 19 October. Johnson, who had campaigned for the leadership of the Tory party on a promise not to delay, had reacted by saying that, despite the new law, the UK would leave at the end of next month, come what may. And No 10 officials briefed that they would attempt to find ways around the law. But what now? Could Johnson really risk another confrontation with the courts by ignoring, or trying to circumvent, that legislation? Tensions at the highest levels of government over how to respond to the supreme court ruling were quickly exposed after the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, rose to his feet to make a statement on his legal opinion of the court\u2019s judgment. Overnight, it had been reported that the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had described the court\u2019s decision as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d, a comment that Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn raised with Cox. Did he agree? Was the government ready collectively to turn on the court? With Rees-Mogg sitting a few places away from him, Cox rapidly contradicted his cabinet colleague. \u201cI do not think that it was a constitutional coup. I know that the right honourable gentleman will know that I do not and I do not believe anybody does.\u201d Rees-Mogg twitched his left eyebrow nervously. Cox\u2019s tone, when speaking about the legal judgment, was reasoned and measured. But later he turned suddenly from eloquent lawyer into political rottweiler, revealing what was clearly going to be the government tactic. Cox turned on parliament, saying it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that MPs had \u201cblocked\u201d the will of the 17.4 million people who had voted Leave. If as a lawyer he could not attack the courts, he seemed more than willing to go after MPs instead. \u201cThis parliament is a dead parliament,\u201d Cox roared. \u201cIt should no longer sit, it has no moral authority to sit on these green benches.\u201d The temperature was rising. It was not only opposition MPs who were outraged. Cox\u2019s former cabinet colleague Amber Rudd rose to protest at what she saw as dangerous language, condemning Cox and saying a Brexit solution should be sought above all else. \u201cMay I ask the attorney general to work with colleagues to try to find a compromise and to cease this language of pitting parliament against the people?\u201d By the time Johnson entered the Commons later that day, to a chorus of \u201cresign\u201d from the opposition, it was clear not only that he would do no such thing, but that the government was now bent on turning the country against parliament and, more subtly, the courts. Making only fleeting reference to the supreme court ruling, and refusing to apologise for misleading the Queen, Johnson instead attacked opposition MPs for threatening Brexit by passing what he called the \u201csurrender act\u201d \u2013 the legislation that would force him to seek an extension to the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. His tone was contemptuous, his language often provocative and bellicose. Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern reminded the house of the murder by a rightwing extremist of her colleague Jo Cox during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016 and said the PM\u2019s use of words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201ccapitulation\u201d was dangerous and that the mood in the country was \u201cgetting toxic\u201d. \u201cWill he promise to change?\u201d she asked. What reason would anyone have to respect the law if the prime minister could describe the supreme court as \u201cwrong\u201d, refuse to apologise and insult parliament, MPs asked. Then Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff, whose Dewsbury seat is close to that of the late Jo Cox, rose to her feet, her face taut with rage. \u201cWe stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day. Let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2013 surrender act, betrayal, traitor \u2013 and I, for one, am sick of it \u2026 he should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d Johnson was dismissive and unmoved. \u201cI have to say I have never heard such humbug in all my life,\u201d he declared, before being drowned out by cries of \u201cShame!\u201d, prompting Bercow to intervene and call for calm. The next day, Johnson\u2019s sister, the journalist Rachel Johnson, joined those condemning the prime minister. \u201cI think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u2018Britain first,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4 million votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered. I think that is highly reprehensible language to use.\u201d In the Commons, a vote was held on whether there should be a recess to cover this week\u2019s Tory party conference in Manchester. MPs voted against, meaning parliament will sit throughout, but the Tories promised to go ahead with it nonetheless. Opposition leaders met at Westminster to decide what to do next. The SNP began to push the idea of holding a vote of confidence with the aim of ousting Johnson and installing a temporary government that would ask for the delay to Brexit, then call a general election. The Liberal Democrats and a number of former Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip by Johnson would need to back them for it to pass, but were very reluctant, believing they would not have the numbers to win.

He stands accused of failing to declare close personal links to Arcuri when she received thousands of pounds in public business funding and was granted places on official trade trips. Johnson has declined to comment in detail on the claims. So a week that began with Labour in turmoil and Johnson\u2019s team upbeat was ending with talk of opposition MPs striking back and exploring ways to depose him. Asked on Thursday why they were backing plans for a vote of confidence in Johnson\u2019s government this week, a senior SNP MP said: \u201cBecause everyone agrees that we just have to get the bastard out.\u201d Five frantic days Monday Boris Johnson arrives in New York for the UN general assembly. During the trip, he meets Donald Trump, who says Johnson is \u201cdoing very well\u201d and would get Brexit done. Johnson uses his assembly address to say some MPs are turning Brexit into an endless process like the torment of the Greek mythological figure Prometheus. Tuesday Baroness Hale, president of the supreme court, sends shockwaves around Westminster as she reveals the court has unanimously decided that Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament was unlawful. Commons Speaker John Bercow rules that parliament should reopen the next day. MPs begin to return to Westminster. Wednesday MPs take their seats in the Commons.

He also describes Brexit as a \u201cwalk in the park\u201d. \u201cWe are enjoying this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to leave and we are going to win.\u201d Friday Johnson is referred for potential investigation into whether he committed misconduct in public office. The referral relates to allegations, which he denies, that he gave businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri favourable treatment due to their friendship. Michael Savage",

      "body": "<p>Shortly after 1pm on Friday, detectives left the ground-floor offices of the Labour MP for Dewsbury. After talking to Paula Sherriff for more than an hour, West Yorkshire police launched three separate investigations into death threats made against her. All are linked to the fallout from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/25/outrage-as-boris-johnson-dismisses-dangers-of-inflammatory-language-as-humbug-video\" title=\"\">Sherriff\u2019s exchange with</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/25/outrage-as-boris-johnson-dismisses-dangers-of-inflammatory-language-as-humbug-video\" title=\"\"> Boris Johnson</a> in the Commons on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The two had clashed amid tumultuous scenes, with Sherriff making a reference to Jo Cox, her friend and fellow Labour MP, who was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-found-guilty-of-jo-cox-murder\" title=\"\"> murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016</a>. Sherriff appealed for the prime minister to dial down his language. Johnson dismissed her concerns as \u201chumbug\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/dewsbury-map/giv-3902JLKPMCgIfXMj\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/dewsbury-map/giv-3902JLKPMCgIfXMj\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Less than two days later, Sherriff\u2019s anger has been replaced by sadness. During the intervening period her office has received hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/abuse-is-virtually-constant-female-mps-speak-about-the-threats-they-face\" title=\"\">abusive messages</a> via voicemail, Facebook and email.</p> <p>\u201cHundreds of messages are calling me names, all sorts. And there\u2019s some awful voicemail messages: we\u2019ve had some very shouty ones this morning, the height of unpleasantness,\u201d she said, attempting a thin smile.</p> <p>Amid the hate, one theme emerged: many of the abusers were mimicking the language of the prime minister. \u201cPeople are parroting his words in the emails we are getting: \u2018you voted for the Surrender Act\u2019, \u2018capitulation\u2019. People are so angry, and the fact that we have a prime minister who is deliberately stoking up this toxic atmosphere is beyond irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>Another theme that swiftly became apparent in the abusive messages was an undisguised hatred for women. Sherriff estimates that 70% of the callers are misogynistic, many inquiring about her menstrual cycle or accusing her of being \u201chysterical\u201d.</p> <p>Such experiences are shared five miles up the Spen valley in the village of Gomersal, in the constituency offices of Labour MP Tracy Brabin. She joined the fray last week, reminding Johnson that \u201cwords have consequences\u201d.</p> <p>Few MPs are more qualified to make that point: Brabin took over as MP for Batley and Spen after the death of Cox, who was murdered by a local resident a few days before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Cox\u2019s murder remains raw for many in this post-industrial corner of West Yorkshire and some believe Johnson\u2019s approach is agitating uncomfortable emotions. Since the Commons exchanges on Wednesday, Brabin\u2019s office has received four times the amount of abuse it would normally expect, the MP says. Cox was murdered outside a nearby library, where she was about to hold a constituency surgery, and already police have advised Brabin that she requires police protection. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a number of malicious phone calls and we are going to have to have a police presence in our surgery. We\u2019ve had a load of shite that we don\u2019t normally get,\u201d said the 58-year-old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c/0_102_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Sherriff challenging Boris Johnson on his use of language in the Commons on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Sherriff challenging Boris Johnson on his use of language in the Commons on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Brabin, who prides herself on being accessible to her community, it is an alarming development. The MP fears she won\u2019t be able to campaign properly in a forthcoming election for what will be a fiercely contested seat. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult. I want to be accessible. I don\u2019t want to get into a position where the police are saying that I can\u2019t do that any more.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after 1pm on Friday, detectives left the ground-floor offices of the Labour MP for Dewsbury. After talking to Paula Sherriff for more than an hour, West Yorkshire police launched three separate investigations into death threats made against her. All are linked to the fallout from Sherriff\u2019s exchange with Boris Johnson in the Commons on Wednesday night. The two had clashed amid tumultuous scenes, with Sherriff making a reference to Jo Cox, her friend and fellow Labour MP, who was murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016. Sherriff appealed for the prime minister to dial down his language. Johnson dismissed her concerns as \u201chumbug\u201d. Less than two days later, Sherriff\u2019s anger has been replaced by sadness. During the intervening period her office has received hundreds of abusive messages via voicemail, Facebook and email. \u201cHundreds of messages are calling me names, all sorts. And there\u2019s some awful voicemail messages: we\u2019ve had some very shouty ones this morning, the height of unpleasantness,\u201d she said, attempting a thin smile. Amid the hate, one theme emerged: many of the abusers were mimicking the language of the prime minister. \u201cPeople are parroting his words in the emails we are getting: \u2018you voted for the Surrender Act\u2019, \u2018capitulation\u2019. People are so angry, and the fact that we have a prime minister who is deliberately stoking up this toxic atmosphere is beyond irresponsible.\u201d Another theme that swiftly became apparent in the abusive messages was an undisguised hatred for women. Sherriff estimates that 70% of the callers are misogynistic, many inquiring about her menstrual cycle or accusing her of being \u201chysterical\u201d. Such experiences are shared five miles up the Spen valley in the village of Gomersal, in the constituency offices of Labour MP Tracy Brabin. She joined the fray last week, reminding Johnson that \u201cwords have consequences\u201d. Few MPs are more qualified to make that point: Brabin took over as MP for Batley and Spen after the death of Cox, who was murdered by a local resident a few days before the EU referendum. Cox\u2019s murder remains raw for many in this post-industrial corner of West Yorkshire and some believe Johnson\u2019s approach is agitating uncomfortable emotions. Since the Commons exchanges on Wednesday, Brabin\u2019s office has received four times the amount of abuse it would normally expect, the MP says. Cox was murdered outside a nearby library, where she was about to hold a constituency surgery, and already police have advised Brabin that she requires police protection. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a number of malicious phone calls and we are going to have to have a police presence in our surgery. We\u2019ve had a load of shite that we don\u2019t normally get,\u201d said the 58-year-old. For Brabin, who prides herself on being accessible to her community, it is an alarming development. The MP fears she won\u2019t be able to campaign properly in a forthcoming election for what will be a fiercely contested seat. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult. I want to be accessible. I don\u2019t want to get into a position where the police are saying that I can\u2019t do that any more. I\u2019ve got to be able to talk to my community,\u201d she said. On the nearby streets of Dewsbury, a perennially marginal seat where Sherriff will be defending a 3,321-vote majority over the Tories, Johnson\u2019s language proves predictably divisive. Student Angela Robinson, 21, said: \u201cHe\u2019s denigrating the memory of Jo Cox. If Boris is ever brave enough to come here, he won\u2019t be welcome.\u201d But outside the town hall Mohammed Zaki, 52, said: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get Brexit done; you have to be ruthless.\u201d On the Dewsbury Matters Facebook group, others attacked the town\u2019s MP, with one contributor writing: \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor to your constituents \u2026 We voted out !!! I\u2019M BACKING BOJO.\u201d But Johnson\u2019s strategy has caused some unease 190 miles south, in Westminster. The day after the furious Commons exchanges, Sherriff revealed that a number of Tory MPs had approached her to offer support, and some had confirmed they were making complaints to the party whip over Johnson\u2019s conduct. \u201cA Tory MP who is very loyal [to Johnson] said: \u2018May I hug you?\u2019 and then he said: \u2018I want you to know that I am mortified about what happened last night, there are so many of us with you and we are making representations to the chief whip.\u2019\u201d A cabinet minister also told her that he would personally \u201csort this out\u201d with Johnson and had already texted the prime minister. Of broader concern is what Brabin and Sherriff describe as an emboldening of the far right in their community. On 12 October the far-right anti-Islam group the Yorkshire Patriots are due to march through Dewsbury in one of the first far-right demonstrations in the area since Cox was murdered. It is an upsetting development for both MPs, whose constituencies include significant Muslim populations. \u201cThere really is a growing far-right problem around here,\u201d said Sherriff. Other sources of concern shared by both MPs include what they describe as the prime minister\u2019s questionable attitude towards women. \u201cWe have to get it across to people that he is not a champion for women,\u201d said Brabin. Yet both know that another bruising week in Westminster may have dissuaded future female parliamentary candidates from stepping forward. Sherriff said one female MP had already told her she would not be standing at the next election because of the level of abuse. \u201cHow can I go to high schools around here and say: \u2018Become an MP, it\u2019s amazing\u2019?

      "bodyText": "Here is Sean Ingle on Christian Coleman rising to the forefront of the sport and tonight\u2019s other astonishing achievements from Sifan Hassan in the the women\u2019s 10,000m and Tajay Gayle in the men\u2019s long jump. Goodbye! As the athletes prepare for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s 50 kilometres race walk in 30 minutes, remember to read Sean Ingle\u2019s report on the widespread discontent from athletes after a disastrous women\u2019s marathon last night. It\u2019s hard to imagine that things will be any different this evening. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Until next time. Michael Johnson had his say in the BBC studio about Coleman\u2019s stunning 9.76: We saw in the early rounds what could\u2019ve been and he certainly delivered with the 9.76 and it puts him sixth all time on the list now. We knew this was a quick track, [but] there were questions coming in about his fitness, not having the opportunity to run races to build up to this because [he was] dealing with the whereabouts issue. Certainly he was able to use these rounds to prepare himself for an amazing performance there without being pushed. If you think about some of the fast times you\u2019ve seen in the 100 metres, they\u2019ve been pushed by someone else but in this race he was all by himself and just executed to perfection. Zharnel Hughes finished in 6th place with a respectable 10.03, but he was clearly disappointed as he talked to the BBC: It wasn\u2019t the best race form me unfortunately tonight. But hey, congratulations to the winners and medalists and all the best to them. Those things happen unfortunately. You just have to be strong minded, refocus, and come again and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I can\u2019t give up on myself, I still have the 200 metres to go. My body just wasn\u2019t feeling up for it unfortunately. When I pushed out, I was just all over the place, I lost my form and I\u2019m not happy with that. But hey, I live to fight another day. Coleman arrived in the final as the only man to dip under 10 seconds, but that was a fast, fast final. It still didn\u2019t matter. Coleman obliterated them all - he tore out of the blocks as he has done all year and continued to pull away, securing a stunning personal best and world lead. Great effort from De Grasse to record a personal best of his own after a couple of years of injuries. Meanwhile, 37 year old Gatlin is still running 9.89. Justin Gatlin (9.89) takes second, Andre De Grasse (9.90) third. There may not be many people in the crowd to see it, but this is certainly a lights show worthy of a 100m final. Here we go... Have the crowds improved on the weekend? Uh, not quite. It\u2019s time for the main event of the evening. Christian Coleman is the heavy favourite to take the 100m title after two blistering runs of 9.98 and 9.88 in the heats and semi-finals. He is the only man to dip under 10 seconds so far. The rest of the medals are wide open. Akani Simbine is the second fastest man so far in Doha after his 10.01 run in the semis and Britain\u2019s Zharnel Hughes qualified in third with a 10.05 semi-final run. Andre De Grasse also showed some good form in the semi-finals after an injury ravaged few years. Who will soar under pressure? Of all the possible contenders for gold, not many thought it would be the 23 year-old Jamaican with a personal best of 8.32m. He did it with a 8.69m jump, the 10th best in history. Jeff Henderson (8.39m) and Juan Miguel Echevarria (8.34m) take silver and bronze. Indeed. Jamaica\u2019s Tajay Gayle is in the midst of the meet of his life. After a PB of 8.46 in the opening round, he obliterates his new PB in his fourth attempt with an stunning world lead of 8.69. His lifetime best was 8.32 before today! This will be incredibly difficult for Jeff Henderson and Juan Miguel Echevarria in silver and bronze. Sifan Hassan is the world lead over 1500m this year with 3.55.30 and also over 10,000m with 30:17.62. A mind-blowing range of excellence. Letesenbet Gidey and Agnes Tirop took silver and bronze. Seven of the top eight finishers recorded personal bests. What an athlete. The world record holder over a mile, who is also entered in 1500m and 5000m, steps up to and wins her first world title with a 30:17.62 world lead. Here goes the bell! Hassan moves into the lead with a lap to go. Gidey is trying to react, but she can\u2019t. Surely she\u2019s not going to do this? Back on the track, Gidey has made her move and kicked ahead. Hassan, Tirop and Obiri all in pursuit. Two laps to go. After resting at the back of the leading pack for a while, Hassan looks so sharp in second. After three rounds of the long jump, favourite world leader Echevarria still has work to do. While Tajay Gayle has recorded two fouls while trying to better his 8.46m lead, Echevarria moved up into second place with a jump of 8.34m. Jeff Henderson responded immediately with a 8.39m jump. This is fun. And now it\u2019s time for the 10,000m women\u2019s final. Keep an eye out for Letesenbet Gidey, Agnes Tirop and Hellen Obiri, and what can Sifan Hassan do? British interest is provided by Steph Twell and Eilish McColgan. Olympic champion Jeff Henderson sends his own message with a jump of 8.28. The challengers have come to play and Echevarria is down to third. Defending champ Luvo Manyonga is also in the conversation with a mark of 8.16. Ruswahl Samaai also threw down a jump of 8.11. Not a single man other than Echevarria crossed 8.10 in qualifying but now they\u2019re doing it for fun. It just goes to show how nerve-wracking actually getting to the final is. A monstrous first jump from Jamaica\u2019s Tajay Gayle, who immediately moves into first place with an effort of 8.46m. Echevarria responds with a decent 8.25m but he was far from the board and his leg trailed behind him as he landed. It\u2019s going to be fun watching him trying to catch that. It\u2019s men\u2019s long jump time. 21 year-old Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarria is the man to beat. He threw down the gauntlet by easily jumping 8.40 in his very first qualifying attempt and then relaxed for the rest of the day while the other competitors failed to clear 8.10 metres. We\u2019ll see what they have for him tonight... As suspected, her enormous third round throw of 77.54 was untouchable. Joanna Fiodorow (76.35) and Zheng Wang (74.76) take silver and bronze. No change in the women\u2019s hammer throw final going into the final round. Not everyone is convinced. Great Britain will compete in the 4x400 mixed relay final. They are in as one of the two fastest losers, but notably with the fourth fastest time overall. There really could be a medal in there for GB if Rooney can improve on the anchor leg. The answer is not very well. As fun as it was to see the the male runners of Japan, Kota Wakabayashi and Tomoya Tamura, explode into the lead, their 17 year-old Saki Takashima was caught easily and finished in last. But at least it was fun! At the front, Poland, Brazil, and India finished in the top 3. That was disastrous in a different way for Belgium as Dylan Borlee eased up in second place towards the end and was passed for fourth place. The second 4x400m mixed relay heat is underway. Nothing but love for Japan being the only team to do something different and put a female runner on the first leg. We\u2019ll see how this works out... There is no substitute for experience. That was tough. United States run 3:12.42 to win the first mixed 4x400m relay heat with a world record in this very new event. Great Britain were second going into the final lap after great runs from Yousif, Clark and Diamond, but Martyn Rooney just didn\u2019t have enough to hold off Bahrain and Jamaica for one of the automatic spots. Leading women\u2019s 400m runner Salwa Eid Naser was the true MVP there - she made up such a huge gap on the third leg to put Bahrain in contention. So, it\u2019s time for the mixed 4x400m relay. Great Britain have gone with Rabah Yousif, Zoey Clark, Emily Diamond and Martyn Rooney. Everyone in heat one has structured their team as Man-Woman-Woman-Man. Jamaica and United States will undoubtedly be dangerous. Meanwhile, the first medal of the day is up for grabs as the women\u2019s hammer throw heads into the third round. Meet favourite DeAnna Price of the United States, who also qualified in first, just threw a brilliant 77.54m to extend her lead on Poland\u2019s Johanna Fiodorow, who landed a 76.35 personal best. With four-time champ Anita Wlodarczyk out with injury, that will be hard to beat. Jamaica is hot, Doha is hot and so is Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\u2019s form. 10.80 earlier today. Check out Sean Ingle\u2019s report on the mass discontent among athletes and team officials after the opening day of sparse crowds and oppressive heat finished with a disastrous marathon where just 40 of 68 runners finished the race. Plenty has already happened earlier today, most notably with the female sprinters dusting off their spikes in the 100m heats ahead of the semi-finals and final tomorrow. Dina Asher-Smith continued to soar under pressure, winning her heat with a smooth and easy 10.97 run. Marie-Jos\u00e9e Ta Lou also impressed, running 10.85 in a heat where Britain\u2019s Daryll Neita also qualified in second with a sold time of 11.12. Elaine Thompson also won comfortably and will look for more in the semis. However, it was Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce who stole the show with a blinding 10.80 run. These are the leaders of an incredibly competitive women\u2019s 100 metres and it will be fascinating to see how things shake up tomorrow. Hello! Welcome to day two of our coverage at the Athletics World Championships in Doha, where we will be following another packed evening of finals. We will have heats of the wildly entertaining mixed 4x400 metres relay and then the women\u2019s 10,000m final. It will be particularly interesting to see how mile world record holder Sifan Hassan fares at a longer distance. All eyes will be on 21 year-old Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarria in the men\u2019s long jump final, who jumped 8.40 in his opening qualifying event while his rivals flailed. Finally, the second night in the Khalifa International Stadium will conclude with the main event. In the men\u2019s 100 metres final, the controversial Christian Coleman is the pick of the field after clocking the only sub-10 time of the heats and semi-finals, winning through in 9.88 after a cool 9.98 in his heat. Britain\u2019s Zharnel Hughes is also through to the final after recording a 10.05 second place finish in the semi-finals.",

      "bodyText": "Noel Burns started work on Stockton beach as a council lifeguard in 1971 and spent 37 years with his eyes fixed on the surf and the sand. \u201cMate, I\u2019m broken-hearted,\u201d says the 70-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible what it looks like now. They have been studying this [erosion] for 20 years but nothing is getting done. Everyone is getting angry now.\u201d Stockton beach in New South Wales is being washed away by dramatic coastal erosion which has already claimed a childcare centre, and the community is now demanding emergency action from the state government. The childcare centre, supporting 72 children, was forced to permanently close on 3 September and the Stockton Surf Life Saving Club \u2013 once a 150-metre run for Noel Burns across the sand from the waves \u2013 now has water regularly crashing at its rock wall. In June last year, erosion exposed a dump site containing asbestos that made its way onto the sands. There have also been temporary closures of cabins at a caravan park, although they have been reopened. Surf competitions that used to be held at the front of the surf club are now relocating several kilometres away. A GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $16,000 since it was launched a week ago. Last Sunday, more than 500 residents attended a rally at a safe end of the beach, which now has only one safe access point. Locals say the erosion has been getting worse over the past 20 years. The NSW local government minister, Shelley Hancock, has vowed to visit the community \u201cin the coming days\u201d. Callan Nickerson, the president of the 112-year-old Stockton Surf Life Saving Club, said the beach was the heart and soul of the community. \u201cPeople used to come home from work and kick off their shoes and get straight down there to put their feet in the water. Now they\u2019re just going down to see how much sand we\u2019ve lost that day. It\u2019s sad and it\u2019s shameful.\u201d Nickerson said the NSW government and Newcastle city council had known about the extensive erosion issues \u201csince the 1980s\u201d but there had been a lack of meaningful action. He said erosion had been happening in Stockton \u201cfor at least 100 years\u201d as a result of two manmade break walls constructed as part of the port of Newcastle works. \u201cWhen essential services are being affected it should send a clear message to the state government that it is now time to act,\u201d he said. Stockton Community Action Group has sought legal advice from the New South Wales Environmental Defenders\u2019 Office. Simon Jones, a group member and surfer, said the group wanted to know if they could move sand from a nearby bank about 1,000 metres offshore to replace the 10 million cubic metres he said had been lost. \u201cWe feel [the government] should be taking a much more proactive approach. It\u2019s just heartbreaking. As a kid I took the beach for granted, but I\u2019ve watched it deteriorate before my eyes.\u201d The state MP for Newcastle, Tim Crakanthorp, accused the government of inaction, saying he had raised the issue \u201cmore than 50 times\u201d in parliament. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s like bashing your head against a sea wall. This community is being washed away while the government buries its head in the sand.\u201d Lucas Gresham, a Stockton real estate agent who is organising the crowdfunding campaign, said the money would be used to fund any legal case. \u201cWe need immediate sand nourishment \u2013 that\u2019s going to help the community while we come up with an end result,\u201d he said. The city of Newcastle has carried out emergency works in recent weeks using large one-tonne sandbags while repairing a sea wall. The council has said the surf club, a local cafe and a car park \u201care safe for the long term\u201d. Associate professor David Kennedy, a coastal geomorphologist at the University of Melbourne, says what\u2019s happening in Stockton is a \u201cclassic case\u201d where human development has interfered with the natural movement of sand along coastlines. He said it was fair for the residents to blame the construction of walls, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve interrupted the along-shore transport and, essentially, just blocked the flow of sand.\u201d Around Australia, he said, \u201cwe are seeing more and more cases like Stockton.\u201d \u201cThe developments we\u2019ve been doing have reduced beaches\u2019 natural resilience,\u201d he said. Honorary professor Andrew Short, of the University of Sydney, has visited every beach in Australia to study coastal systems. He says for hundreds of years Stockton has been losing sand to dunes to the north and this, together with the building of walls perpendicular to the coast, meant Stockton\u2019s beach was being starved of sand. He said many of Australia\u2019s known hotspots for hazardous erosion had been created because as towns grew, buildings and infrastructure were built too close to the shore at a time when \u201cthey really didn\u2019t know much better\u201d. A UN climate report on Thursday predicted that by 2050, the world would be experiencing a sharp increase in the number of extreme events caused by sea level rise. Climate change, said Short, was \u201ccertainly going to exacerbate any problems that we\u2019ve already got\u201d. Hancock, the local government minister who has responsibility for coastal management issues, told Guardian Australia she would visit Stockton beach to meet residents and council officials \u201cin the coming days\u201d. She said the state government was working with the city of Newcastle to \u201cdevelop solutions to manage the region\u2019s coastline\u201d. The NSW government has given Newcastle city council more than $1.2m for tackling \u201cissues across the region\u2019s coastline\u201d, she said, as well as support through numerous studies and reports aimed at finding solutions. Hancock added she had asked the department of planning, industry and environment to speak to the council to help it apply for assistance through an $83m government fund, and she had also asked for deadlines for applications to be extended by two weeks.",

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019ve had a driver\u2019s licence photo or passport photo taken in Australia in the past few years, it\u2019s likely your face will end up in a massive new national network the federal government is trying to create. Victoria and Tasmania have already begun to upload driver\u2019s licence details to state databases that will eventually be linked to a future national one. Legislation before federal parliament will allow government agencies and private businesses to access facial IDs held by state and territory traffic authorities, and passport photos held by the foreign affairs department. The justification for what would be the most significant compulsory collection of personal data since My Health Record is cracking down on identity fraud. The home affairs department estimates that the annual cost of ID fraud is $2.2bn, and says introducing a facial component to the government\u2019s document verification service would help prevent it. The verification service is already used by 100 government agencies and 700 businesses, carrying out more than 30m ID checks in 2017 alone. But alongside the document verification service, a facial identification service for law enforcement would be introduced. Almost all state and territory governments have updated their driver\u2019s licence laws in anticipation of the database after an agreement at the Council of Australian Governments in October 2017, while people getting passports sign a form that states that their photographs will be used for biometric matching purposes. What are the concerns? Privacy advocates say the new legislation lacks proportionality \u2013 that the benefits do not outweigh the intrusion into people\u2019s privacy. The Australian Privacy Foundation says the proposal is highly invasive, because the system could be integrated into a number of other systems that collect facial data, including closed-circuit television. \u201cWe are on our way to automated and real-time surveillance of public spaces,\u201d the foundation says. In Hong Kong in August, pro-democracy protesters were seen using an electric saw to cut down a lamp post. It was a fightback against government surveillance, with fears the cameras in the post were using facial recognition technology so the Chinese government could identify the activists. This might seem a world away, but when the Gold Coast hosted the Commonwealth Games last year, Queensland police trialled facial recognition software on CCTV footage of crowds to identify 16 high-profile targets. Halfway through the trial, police extended it to general policing, though they were only able to find five people out of 268 plugged into the system. False positives are a massive problem plaguing the effectiveness of the system. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police used automated facial recognition in trials in 2016 and 2017 and reported that more than 98% of matches wrongly identified innocent members of the public. Overall there were 102 false positives. The Australian Human Rights Commission says facial recognition technology \u201cremains unreliable\u201d. \u201cIf inaccurate information received from the use of this technology is used by law enforcement, it could also have drastic consequences for the person concerned, including being arbitrarily detained and having fundamental features of their right to a fair trial compromised,\u201d the human rights commissioner, Edward Santow, told the parliamentary inquiry. The Human Rights Law Centre noted that NEC Neoface, a separate facial recognition technology used by federal agencies and some state and territory police, has not been tested for accuracy on different ethnic groups, meaning a potentially disproportionate rates of misidentification of ethnic minorities. The home affairs department says it conducts testing and tuning of facial recognition software, and matching results will be reviewed by \u201ctrained facial recognition experts\u201d to prevent false matches. \u201cIn other words, decisions that serve to identify a person will never be made by technology alone,\u201d the department says. Trials such as the one at the Commonwealth Games, and a similar schemes in Perth and Brisbane, work on live facial recognition. The scheme proposed by the federal government would be a more manual input process. The Department of Home Affairs argues that concerns about mass surveillance are not warranted, because it\u2019s just not feasible. They say the systems are not designed for it and there are nowhere near the resources, including personnel sufficiently trained in facial recognition, that would be needed to conduct a mass surveillance program. The standalone system for law enforcement requires a person to manually submit a person\u2019s image and resolve against possible matches, and it creates an audit trail, the department says. While CCTV still images can be put into the system to identify someone, the department says it is \u201cnot technically possible\u201d to livestream CCTV footage into the system. But should it become \u201ctechnically possible\u201d under the legislation, the minister could set the rules to allow it. Kristine Klugman, the president of Civil Liberties Australia, told the committee it could happen soon. \u201cIndeed, it is only a matter of time before the combination of cloud services, mobile, high-definition video capture (including smartphones) and \u2018big data\u2019 analytics will make such real-time surveillance possible, cheap and enticing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen that happens, we can again expect to hear similar claims that our police and spy agencies \u2018are only effective if they have the tools necessary to effectively enforce the law and detect and prevent threats to the Australian community\u2019.\u201d",

It was recognition that Big Overseas Visits\u2122 by Australian leaders, and this was certainly one, have a habit of colliding with major geopolitical events. John Howard was in America on 9/11 and during the London bombings. Malcolm Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/20/presidents-planes-and-paris-inside-the-whirlwind-of-malcolm-turnbulls-first-world-tour\">was in Berlin during the Paris terror attacks</a>. We wondered \u2013 in a bout of long-haul flight inspired free-floating trepidation \u2013 what might lie before us.</p> <p>It turned out the wildcard was impeachment.</p> <p>Questions about Donald Trump and a call he made to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, were coming thick and fast from the moment we were wheels down in Washington at Andrews airforce base. Morrison arrived in a febrile atmosphere in the American capital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/slug-trump-ukraine-latest-whistleblower-complaint-2020-election\">White House tried to cover up Trump's Ukraine conversation, whistleblower alleges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the root of the gathering storm was a complaint from a whistleblower \u2013 believed to be an intelligence official \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/slug-trump-ukraine-latest-whistleblower-complaint-2020-election\">that Trump was using the power of his presidential office to solicit interference from a foreign country</a> in the 2020 election. Extraordinary doesn\u2019t even begin to describe that behaviour by the president of the United States, even if the president we happen to be talking about is Trump.</p> <p>This scandal rolled in over the course of the week as Morrison gave practical effect to one of his most significant judgments in his still new prime ministership \u2013 the decision to lean into the US alliance, and to the relationship with Trump specifically, at this moment in history, a moment when much appears to be running off the rails.</p> <p>The Australian prime minister is deepening the relationship with America at a time when many world leaders are keeping their distance from Trump and the circus of his presidency.</p> <p>Quite frankly, in assessing this trip and its consequences, we need to dwell less on the pomp and circumstance of the visit, less on the South Lawn and the great honour of the state dinner and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/23/morrison-visits-an-australian-box-factory-in-ohio-and-the-trump-crowd-goes-wild\">Trump graciously opening Anthony Pratt\u2019s new paper business in woop woop Ohio</a>, and think more about this risk, and why Morrison is taking it.</p> <p>I sought to try and get to the bottom of this question on the road with the prime minister this week, and I also sought to try and get some insight into Trump by watching him during our short windows of direct exposure.</p> <p>In terms of the why for Morrison, I think the answer to that is relatively simple. When he looks at Trump, he sees someone different to him, but someone he can work with.</p> <p>Trump looks less chaotic to Morrison than he does to the rest of us because, unlike us, the Australian PM comprehends at a deeper level how the Americans are thinking \u2013 on trade, China, the tension with Iran, and a host of other issues relevant to Australia.</p> <p>Understanding where the Trumpites are coming from \u2013 insofar as that can be understood when you are dealing, fundamentally, with a loose unit in the Oval Office \u2013 allows Australia to separate the signal from the noise.</p> <p>Given Trump specialises in misdirection and distraction, if you are a partner and an ally, and you can get close enough to find a tethering point, then it becomes easier to screen out the chaos and focus on the transactions \u2013 what are the common interests, and how can they be advanced.</p> <p>Trade is an obvious case in point. Australia\u2019s position on Washington\u2019s trade dispute with China is more complex than it seems. Australia has been a loud diplomatic voice urging Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to come to terms and desist from the retaliatory behaviour that is imperilling global growth. But the government also hopes Trump will be able to crash through on this issue and reset the rules of the road, because if he does that will benefit Australia.</p> <p>Morrison is trying to craft a position with Trump where he counsels both restraint and persistence in the trade war, which takes a certain amount of diplomatic deftness. I think the prime minister pulled that off this week.</p> <p>The other insight that I gained, apart from a better understanding of why Morrison was taking the risk of leaning in to a president others are stepping back from, was about Trump himself. At close range, you can actually see method in his shtick.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/25/lambasting-china-over-their-emissions-might-impress-the-us-but-it-could-be-costly-for-australia\">Lambasting China over its emissions might impress the US but it could be costly for Australia | Frank Jotzo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/21/scott-morrison-scrambles-to-contain-political-mushroom-cloud-after-trump-raises-nuclear-option-with-iran\">fascinating to be with Trump in the Oval Office</a> so I could see the way he operates. From a distance of only a couple of metres, I could see the mental calculations he was making second-by-second. He had a simple objective: stonewall, redirect and destabilise the room. It was stream of consciousness insanity, no doubt, but what I learned by watching him over half an hour was it was calculated stream of consciousness insanity \u2013 at least in that outing.</p> <p>When I saw that, I gained a better understanding of why Morrison was taking the risk. Fundamentally, Morrison sees a rational actor lurking behind all the demagoguery.

      "bodyText": "At a refuelling stop in Honolulu on our way to Washington, a fellow reporter and I, trying to distract ourselves from the Cat Stevens ukulele covers wafting through an empty airport terminal, wondered what could happen over the coming week to disrupt Scott Morrison\u2019s first visit to Washington as prime minister. Our musing wasn\u2019t malicious. It was recognition that Big Overseas Visits\u2122 by Australian leaders, and this was certainly one, have a habit of colliding with major geopolitical events. John Howard was in America on 9/11 and during the London bombings. Malcolm Turnbull was in Berlin during the Paris terror attacks. We wondered \u2013 in a bout of long-haul flight inspired free-floating trepidation \u2013 what might lie before us. It turned out the wildcard was impeachment. Questions about Donald Trump and a call he made to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, were coming thick and fast from the moment we were wheels down in Washington at Andrews airforce base. Morrison arrived in a febrile atmosphere in the American capital. At the root of the gathering storm was a complaint from a whistleblower \u2013 believed to be an intelligence official \u2013 that Trump was using the power of his presidential office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election. Extraordinary doesn\u2019t even begin to describe that behaviour by the president of the United States, even if the president we happen to be talking about is Trump. This scandal rolled in over the course of the week as Morrison gave practical effect to one of his most significant judgments in his still new prime ministership \u2013 the decision to lean into the US alliance, and to the relationship with Trump specifically, at this moment in history, a moment when much appears to be running off the rails. The Australian prime minister is deepening the relationship with America at a time when many world leaders are keeping their distance from Trump and the circus of his presidency. Quite frankly, in assessing this trip and its consequences, we need to dwell less on the pomp and circumstance of the visit, less on the South Lawn and the great honour of the state dinner and Trump graciously opening Anthony Pratt\u2019s new paper business in woop woop Ohio, and think more about this risk, and why Morrison is taking it. I sought to try and get to the bottom of this question on the road with the prime minister this week, and I also sought to try and get some insight into Trump by watching him during our short windows of direct exposure. In terms of the why for Morrison, I think the answer to that is relatively simple. When he looks at Trump, he sees someone different to him, but someone he can work with. Trump looks less chaotic to Morrison than he does to the rest of us because, unlike us, the Australian PM comprehends at a deeper level how the Americans are thinking \u2013 on trade, China, the tension with Iran, and a host of other issues relevant to Australia. Understanding where the Trumpites are coming from \u2013 insofar as that can be understood when you are dealing, fundamentally, with a loose unit in the Oval Office \u2013 allows Australia to separate the signal from the noise. Given Trump specialises in misdirection and distraction, if you are a partner and an ally, and you can get close enough to find a tethering point, then it becomes easier to screen out the chaos and focus on the transactions \u2013 what are the common interests, and how can they be advanced. Trade is an obvious case in point. Australia\u2019s position on Washington\u2019s trade dispute with China is more complex than it seems. Australia has been a loud diplomatic voice urging Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to come to terms and desist from the retaliatory behaviour that is imperilling global growth. But the government also hopes Trump will be able to crash through on this issue and reset the rules of the road, because if he does that will benefit Australia. Morrison is trying to craft a position with Trump where he counsels both restraint and persistence in the trade war, which takes a certain amount of diplomatic deftness. I think the prime minister pulled that off this week. The other insight that I gained, apart from a better understanding of why Morrison was taking the risk of leaning in to a president others are stepping back from, was about Trump himself. At close range, you can actually see method in his shtick. It was fascinating to be with Trump in the Oval Office so I could see the way he operates. From a distance of only a couple of metres, I could see the mental calculations he was making second-by-second. He had a simple objective: stonewall, redirect and destabilise the room. It was stream of consciousness insanity, no doubt, but what I learned by watching him over half an hour was it was calculated stream of consciousness insanity \u2013 at least in that outing. When I saw that, I gained a better understanding of why Morrison was taking the risk. Fundamentally, Morrison sees a rational actor lurking behind all the demagoguery. Because I was there, I could put the two elements of the equation together \u2013 Morrison\u2019s core calculation and Trump\u2019s method \u2013 and better understand the building blocks of the judgment. To be clear: I\u2019m not at all sure Morrison has made the right judgment here. I\u2019m not sure I would be confident enough, in his position, to back myself as a Trump whisperer, given the person occupying the presidency is not only unpredictable but in many respects absolutely reprehensible. We are going to have to watch and wait to see whether Morrison is correct to take this calculated risk. The other big issue of the week in the states for Morrison was climate change, and that was a hot mess. Morrison used the trip to telegraph that Australia now wants China to be considered a developed (rather than developing) economy for the purposes of global climate agreements, and that is a significant departure from recent convention. This argument was also framed simplistically. By inference, China was painted as a destructive free rider in the global climate effort. That\u2019s not actually right. China is taking steps to reduce emissions, and in a much more comprehensive way than Australia currently is. To be clear. The world needs China to reduce emissions, and it desperately needs the US not to be plonkers, because these two countries, more than others, will play a major role in determining the fate of the planet. But while the actions in Washington and Beijing are critical, the world also needs Australia not to be a plonker as well. Australians need a government prepared to face up to the transition that the country needs to make. Morrison is trying to lull voters into thinking the government has an acceptable climate policy and any view to the contrary is just noisy progressive activism. Sorry, but this is crap.

      "bodyText": "Michael Mobbs, you might say, has been preparing for this moment his entire life. The 69-year-old former environmental lawyer who, in 1996, converted his two-storey 19th century Sydney terrace into one of the world\u2019s first inner-city self-sufficient homes, is selling his famous passion project and moving to a remote coastal location to prepare for what he predicts will be impending societal collapse induced by climate change. That is, he says, a total breakdown within the next three to five years. Selling his four-bedroom, off-grid Chippendale property that he purchased in 1978 for $23,500 and is now valued at $2.2m is proving more difficult than he thought. He\u2019s had it on the market since March, but wants to sell it to someone who won\u2019t convert the back yard into a car space, who wants to maintain the Saturday morning house tours that have attracted some 30,000 eco-curious visitors, and who will appreciate the home\u2019s unique perks: two resident Australorp chooks named Pesky and Blanche d\u2019Alpuget; less than $300 a year in water and energy bills for a family of four and a leafy street blooming with edible verge gardens. The house also has a water, sewerage and electricity system completely disconnected from the mains: it is powered by solar panels and a battery storage system; clean drinking water falls on the roof and is then filtered for storage in an underground tank; and an aerated waste treatment system recycles all grey and blackwater, ensuring no raw sewage has left the premises in 23 years. Mobbs is in no massive hurry to sell \u2013 he\u2019s yet to acquire that crucial plot of coastal land for his bolthole-to-be. However he does have a new abode in the works that is due for completion in December \u2013 a prefabricated, bushfire-proof, fully sustainable home constructed with recycled materials that he\u2019s creating in partnership with Melbourne-based modular housing specialists Fairweather Homes and Lismore-based renewables company 24 Hour Solar Power. Mobbs\u2019 new home will be the prototype the trio use to take on the mainstream building market, showing that sustainable can be both \u201cbeautiful and elegant\u201d and \u201ccheaper than business as usual\u201d. \u201cResilience and future proofing will be built in through an off-grid water and energy supply and robust materials suitable for extreme weather conditions,\u201d explains architect and Fairweather Homes director Paul Adam. \u201cWith the climate emergency in full swing we need to create solutions that are affordable and accessible and also make a positive contribution to preventing climate change.\u201d It\u2019s a project that for Mobbs is part retirement nest egg, part departing gift to a decaying planet. Mobbs has narrowed the location for his new home to two sites in Australia: south-west Western Australia and Bermagui on the New South Wales south coast, both chosen because, to put it simply, \u201cwherever there are trees, there is rainfall\u201d. There are, of course, other strategic considerations (but more on that later). First Mobbs has to do something he\u2019s been deferring for a while: go \u201cpublic\u201d. Coming out as a survivalist who is abandoning the urban world is no easy step for a man who has authored two bestselling books on sustainable city living, spent two decades as a consultant to the public and private sector, lectured at universities, and has a model of his eco-friendly terrace home exhibited at Sydney\u2019s Powerhouse Museum. Even his two adult children, who he says remain frustratingly indifferent to the apocalypse, aren\u2019t fully across his intentions. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to crabwalk into this conversation with my children,\u201d he says, sighing. \u201cThe idea that life won\u2019t go on for them in the same way it has gone on for me is incomprehensible.\u201d Mobbs has chosen the night before September\u2019s global climate strike to speak his truth at a \u201ctalk and feast\u201d event organised by the community group Transition Bondi. They have invited Mobbs to speak as part of a four-person panel on the topic, \u201cWhat is your response to climate change?\u201d As soup is served, a real-life emergency is unfolding in the kitchen. An overheated kettle has triggered the fire alarm, forcing everyone to file out of the Margaret Whitlam Recreation Centre at Waverley Oval to the repetitive strains of \u201cEmergency, emergency! Evacuate now!\u201d When the kettle has finally been pacified, Mobbs and the panel take their positions. Mobbs is no stranger to public speaking \u2013 quick with a quip and with a lawyer\u2019s gift for the gab \u2013 but tonight he\u2019s nervous, clutching printed notes which he reads from slowly. \u201cMy guess is water, energy, food, the seasons and economies will collapse in the next three to five years,\u201d he says. \u201cAm I certain of these things? No. But like someone diagnosed with a cancer expected to kill me in the next five years, I am now preparing for my personal circumstances over the next few years. The star I steer by is an article by Catherine Ingram, Facing Extinction.\u201d The audience \u2013 who were hoping for a side of hope with their vegan meal \u2013 appear stunned. Mobbs, on the other hand, looks relieved. Speaking to Guardian Australia in the days leading up to and following his big reveal, Mobbs admits he sometimes has moments of doubt, where he wonders if he\u2019s just catastrophising. But he reserves most of his incredulity for people who refuse to believe it could happen here. \u201cI don\u2019t debate it any more \u2013 it\u2019s just a waste of time. What they\u2019re saying is: \u2018I find this too hard to talk about. I don\u2019t want to listen to your point of view,\u2019\u201d he says. It reminds him of the resistance he encountered when he took his inner-city home off grid \u2013 the naysayers, the builders, the hydraulic engineers, the local government officials who said it could never be done. We\u2019re sitting near the fireplace in Mobbs\u2019 Myrtle Street terrace looking out through large glass doors to the landscaped back garden with its small beehive, kumquat trees and homes for micro bats. Mobbs is talking about \u201ccollapse\u201d, which he fears, when it strikes, could unfold very quickly. \u201cI want to get away from the major cities because I think they\u2019ll become unsafe. You look at what happens in places that get cyclones or tornadoes; when the food runs out and it\u2019s hard to get power and water, civil unrest happens in about two or three days,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople die without food and water in a week, and if there are a lot of people dying or at risk of dying, their behaviour will become uncontrollable.\u201d The nation-state, he believes, won\u2019t come to the rescue. \u201cThey will look after themselves and their own. They will appropriate resources to protect their own entitlements. They won\u2019t look after the people who voted for them.\u201d Even this Sydney house won\u2019t withstand the coming crisis, Mobbs says \u2013 a point, I suggest, he probably shouldn\u2019t stress to a prospective buyer. He throws his head back and laughs. \u201cI suppose I could put up a warning note: \u2018Staying here is life-threatening.\u2019\u201d Still, he believes those in the city who are more self-sufficient, including the future occupants of this house, will have an advantage. \u201c[But desperate people] will come here for the water and the energy,\u201d he says, adding drily: \u201cMaybe I should sell it with guns.\u201d When, or if, such a situation arises, Mobbs wants to be well off the radar. Does he see himself as a doomsday prepper? \u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking after me \u2013 I want to survive. I doubt that I will because it\u2019s hard to say where the water will or won\u2019t fall. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find somewhere, where even if the great conveyor belt does break down while I\u2019m alive, there are enough trees to out-arm wrestle the ocean and retain the rainfall.\u201d Enter Bermagui, the frontrunner for his haven from climate disaster. The town of 1,500 people flanked by ocean and forest and midway between Sydney and Melbourne first came to his attention during a chance encounter with chef turned urban farmer Paul West, who hosts the Foxtel series River Cottage Australia. \u201cWe did this gig together for Whitehorse City Council [in Melbourne]. Within 10 minutes we were talking like you and I were talking. He said \u2018I\u2019m moving out of my Melbourne house and back to Bermagui.\u2019 He said \u2018Come to Bermagui. It\u2019s got two wooden bridges which could be burned down should the town need defending.\u2019 I thought, \u2018This is my man!\u2019\u201d Mobbs\u2019 annihilation anxiety can be traced back to his childhood. He grew up on a farm downstream from Forbes in the NSW central west. When he was six the Lachlan River flooded, cutting him and his family off from the world for four months, leaving them reliant on food drops from a Gypsy Moth biplane. It was young Mobbs\u2019 first \u201cexperience of the power of water\u201d, giving him an enduring \u201crespect for the unpredictability of the weather\u201d. A number of factors coalesced in the last year to rekindle Mobb\u2019s unease. With his children flown the coop and his marriage long over, he decided to rent out his Chippendale home for a year and relocate to Bondi Beach so he could swim in the ocean at dawn and \u201csee who I was when I wasn\u2019t that guy in that house\u201d. Three months after the move the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its dire report warning the world only had 12 years to avert a climate catastrophe. Standing at sunrise on the golden strip of sand that lures millions of people each year, Mobbs saw a culture that \u201csimply can\u2019t be sustained\u201d. \u201cBondi is a kind of Andy Warhol picture writ large of good figures and narcissism at every second step,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I found [my sustainable house] was put in perspective, I saw myself as quite an aberration \u2013 just alone with millions of people who have no concept of what the realities are and think that they have time ... They seem to believe that if they have superannuation, climate change won\u2019t apply to them.\u201d During that year Mobbs also took a 4,352km train trip from Perth to Sydney, a journey he describes as \u201cjust four days of dying countryside\u201d. \u201cI travelled through Western Australia across the Nullarbor, through South Australia, down through Broken Hill \u2013 the whole of the country is abandoned and dying,\u201d he says. That the mighty, flood-prone Lachlan River of his youth has now been projected by WaterNSW to run dry by March 2020 given no significant rain or government intervention, fills Mobbs with a grave fear. When NSW premier Bob Carr opened Mobbs\u2019 sustainable house on 9 December 1996, he declared Sydney\u2019s first self-sufficient home \u201ca vision of the future\u201d. Indeed, at last count, more than 20% of Australian homes were fitted with solar panels; this year\u2019s national Sustainable House Day saw 252 homes open their doors to the public; and NSW now has a building sustainability index (Basix) that regulates the energy and water efficiency of new dwellings. In those two decades Mobbs has had significant wins against the state, including Sydney Water, which for years after he\u2019d disconnected his home from the sewage and water mains continued to send him bills (when he didn\u2019t pay up, he says, they threatened to disconnect him). \u201c[Eventually] they came round and did a smoke test. And their faces fell,\u201d he says, grinning. But Mobbs is still locked in an ideological battle with Sydney Water, which he sees as prioritising desalination plants over home rainwater tanks and wastewater recycling systems. The dwindling H2O levels in his own underground storage system is a daily reminder of the city\u2019s water insecurity \u2013 in recent years he\u2019s had to increasingly rely on his neighbour\u2019s garden hose to top up his tank. The latest worst-case scenario projection from WaterNSW is that Warragamba Dam \u2013 Sydney\u2019s primary water supply \u2013 will stop flowing by January 2022. \u201cI\u2019ve done my best here and it hasn\u2019t been enough,\u201d Mobbs says of his Sydney ecohome. \u201cI see what I\u2019ve done as a failure. Not a tragic failure \u2013 I mean it\u2019s changed things such as building regulations \u2026 This house has brought more change than political argument has.

I\u2019m hoping if we can do a good job with this [prefabricated sustainable home] project, we can achieve change.\u201d Next week Mobbs will jump on a bus (he doesn\u2019t own a car) at Central Station and travel eight hours south of Sydney to Bermagui to look for land to buy and establish contacts in a patch of NSW he foresees will be his next home. \u201cIs Bermagui somewhere I want to go?\u201d he says. \u201cSort of yes, sort of no. Somebody gave the analogy of the Jews in Germany [before the Holocaust]. They said there were three types of Jews: those who said \u2018We can\u2019t trust [Hitler], we\u2019re leaving.\u2019 There were people who said \u2018I think we can manage him and bring him round.\u2019 There were others who said \u2018It\u2019ll never happen to us, we\u2019ll be right.\u2019 And the same forms of denial and acceptance are in the conversations I\u2019m having now. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to work out how to live in the face of impending collapse and my solution \u2013 aside from whisky and wine and gardening \u2013 is to do things that have meaning for others and to show faith that it\u2019s possible to do this stuff.\u201d *** One September evening, Sydney\u2019s long dry spell breaks. Days of downpours follow, during which Mobbs monitors with a childlike joy as his 10,000 litre back yard inner-city rainwater tank fills to 96% capacity. One morning that week I receive an email. \u201cBeautiful sound of rain on my tin roof as I write this. More than ever the sound is so gratifying,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier has told the British government that he fears Boris Johnson\u2019s polarising behaviour has effectively blown any chance of finding a majority for a Brexit deal in the Commons. In private discussions with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator said that developments in Westminster had damaged the already slim hope of winning MPs over. According to a leaked note of the meeting, Barnier spoke of the \u201climited chance of approval of a deal in the current parliament\u201d given recent events, an assertion with which Barclay disagreed, insisting a majority could be found. Barnier concluded, however, in a briefing to EU diplomats for the 27 member states, that the \u201ccurrent polarisation in the UK has further reduced the chances of agreement\u201d, according to minutes seen by the Observer. The EU is now concerned that any concession it could make would be wasted on such an unstable government, which has burned any political goodwill by deploying the language of betrayal and surrender when talking of those who oppose a no-deal Brexit. On Saturday, a senior SNP MP, Stewart Hosie, claimed that opposition parties could stage a vote of no confidence in the government as early as this week in an effort to thwart leaving the EU without a deal. It is unlikely the Liberal Democrats and the 21 Tory rebels would agree to Jeremy Corbyn, as leader of the opposition, leading such a government. But the machinations further confirmed to Brussels that Johnson has \u201clost control of events\u201d, senior EU sources said. The behaviour of the prime minister last week in the Commons, where he described fears of Labour MPs about their safety as \u201chumbug\u201d, surprised EU officials and diplomats who had hoped the UK was serious about striking a deal. There is now concern that the government is seeking simply to ramp up a \u201cblame game\u201d, sources said, with the chances of an agreement now seen as being \u201cvery low\u201d. \u201cIf he was going to compromise himself to find a deal with us, you would not be talking up the word \u2018surrender\u2019 all the time\u201d, said one EU diplomat. \u201cJust when you think that it could not be less stable \u2013 something else happens. This isn\u2019t very diplomatic language \u2013 it is mad,\u201d said a second EU source. Barclay told Barnier that the UK would table concrete proposals on Thursday, after the prime minister has made his speech at the Conservative party conference. The UK insists that the status quo cannot continue on the island of Ireland in a post-Brexit scenario but that the extra checks and controls can be done away from the border. Barnier told diplomats for the EU27 last week that the UK had \u201cgiven up on the concept of preventing a border in Northern Ireland as well as the necessity of preserving the all-island economy\u201d. He told the diplomats: \u201cYou can\u2019t base peace on promises \u2013 it will turn the border into a bargaining chip.\u201d The EU\u2019s capitals, in response, have expressed their \u201calarm\u201d to Barnier at the prime minister\u2019s \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude towards the Northern Ireland peace process. Johnson\u2019s discussions in New York with Donald Tusk, the European Council president, have led the member states to conclude that there is a \u201cdeliberate choice in London to bring back a border\u201d, which would \u201cimperil stability\u201d, sources said. Barnier also rejected Barclay\u2019s attempts last Friday to open up talks about contingency plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit., to the British government\u2019s notable frustration, sources said. The Brexit secretary had insisted that on his visits to EU capitals, a desire had been voiced for bilateral talks on how to manage the risks of leaving the EU without a deal. The EU negotiator told the member states that the UK was looking to deliver the same benefits of the withdrawal agreement \u201cbut by different means\u201d. In a letter exchange with Barclay, published last Friday evening, Barnier told the Brexit secretary: \u201cWe will not enter into any negotiations with the United Kingdom on these matters.\u201d He said the only offer he could make to the UK was to answer any specific questions it had over the EU\u2019s unilateral plans to protect itself from the chaos.",

      "bodyText": "It started with an attempt to topple the deputy Labour leader and was marked by noisy in-fighting over the party\u2019s Brexit policy. Yet by the end of Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, senior allies of Jeremy Corbyn believed that they had paved the way for the most radical election manifesto seen in Britain for decades. So many announcements were planned that one key policy \u2013 the decision to radically reshape universal credit and pump some \u00a33bn back into the benefits system in the short term \u2013 was cut out of Corbyn\u2019s speech and revealed on Saturday instead. The policies are as numerous as they are wide-ranging. The aim of a four-day week, a state-owned drugs manufacturer, higher tax for free social care, the reversal of many legal aid cuts, a potential net-zero carbon target of 2030 and free prescriptions are among them. These are on top of controversial plans already announced, such as allowing workers to gain a stake in large companies. \u201cYes, lots of policies aren\u2019t as radical as they sound \u2013 universal credit wouldn\u2019t actually be scrapped and nor will private schools \u2013 but it would be odd not to describe this as a radical programme,\u201d said Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank.

Huge questions remain as to how the various programmes will be funded, but senior Corbyn allies believe it will be enough to turn an election that was meant to be all about Brexit into a wider conversation about public services. So what were the most significant policies unveiled in Brighton? Immigration What happened? The conference voted for a motion to \u201cmaintain and extend free movement rights\u201d for EU citizens \u2013 despite the role immigration played in the referendum campaign. It also told the party to \u201creject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants\u2019 utility to business, and number caps/targets\u201d. It contradicted Labour\u2019s previous manifesto commitment that \u201cfreedom of movement will end\u201d. What\u2019s the reality?

That would not allow free movement to continue. Radical rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Ripping up immigration rules is radical and Labour will take a liberal approach, but whoever comes to power will have to introduce a completely new system after Brexit. Pharma What happened? The surprise announcement in Corbyn\u2019s conference speech was a plan to create a state-owned drugs company capable of making cheap versions of medicines that are too expensive for the NHS. Such a reform would be likely to require patents to be bypassed. It is a big step and an attempt to curb what Labour regards as profiteering by Big Pharma. What\u2019s the reality? A big measure. The pharmaceuticals industry is warning that it will undermine research by discouraging investment in new drugs, and puts smaller companies at particular risk. However, Labour says its plan is similar to policies already used in other countries. Radical rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 This was a new and surprise move from Labour that would take the state into a new arena. Four-day week What happened? John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, announced the most radical measure of the Labour conference \u2013 a pledge to move to a 32-hour week \u201cwithin the next decade\u201d, with no loss of pay. What\u2019s the reality? The details of the policy are rather different to the headline. Businesses will not have a four-day week imposed on them. Instead, Labour will use a series of smaller measures to work towards a reduction in hours. A new commission will recommend increases in holiday entitlement to push down average working times. Meanwhile, the really radical element is the introduction of sector-by-sector collective bargaining with unions. Radical rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 It is far from a top-down plan to slash the working week, but there is real radicalism in this measure because of the hugely enhanced role for trade unionism that it implies. The party has not spelled out how that would work in practice. Social care What happened? Labour committed to bringing in free personal care for the over-65s in England as a way of easing the social care crisis \u2013 at an estimated cost of \u00a36bn. Labour also backs a cap on lifetime care costs. The move will be funded out of general taxation. What\u2019s the reality? It is a big and expensive policy, but reaction to it has been lukewarm from experts in the sector. There are two main concerns. The first is that social care is in such a state that the priority should be stabilising the current system through the expansion of services and retention of staff.

Radical rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 There is big money involved, but Labour will need to spell out the details of its cap on costs and its funding plans. Education What happened? The conference passed a motion calling for the assets of private schools to be redistributed \u201cdemocratically and fairly across the country\u2019s educational institutions\u201d. The motion, which was driven by the party\u2019s grassroots, was denounced by critics for creating a dangerous precedent of the state seizing private assets. What\u2019s the reality? For all the coverage, it was immediately clear that the plans to seize the assets of the private school sector were not supported by the Labour leadership, which is currently promising to end tax reliefs and other state aid. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has signalled that the party wants to go further over time. Meanwhile, her vow to abolish Ofsted is a major change, as is the idea for a National Education Service, which the party has not yet fully sketched out. Radical rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Labour will not seize private school assets, but its education policies represent a major break and private education looks set to face a serious challenge.",

If this is part of a government plan to misuse powers under emergency legislation, I can assure the prime minister we will defeat him in court and in parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson is expected to continue his attacks on Remainers this week at the Tory conference in Manchester where the slogan will be \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d.</p> <p>Former Tory MP and attorney general Dominic Grieve said he could see no other possible way Downing Street could comply with the law and deliver Brexit on time. \u201cThe Civil Contingencies Act is the only possible route I can imagine they can be thinking of,\u201d Grieve said. \u201cBut if they do try to do this it would be a constitutional outrage. And if it passed through parliament it would be immediately challenged in the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Allies of Johnson have warned in recent days that the UK will face civil disorder on the scale of the <em>gilets jaunes</em> protests in France if Brexit were to be delayed or reversed.</p> <p>Senior Labour sources said that possible use of the Civil Contingencies Act to trump the Benn act was on a list of options that the party\u2019s legal advisers believe Downing Street might use.</p> <p>After 11 supreme court judges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">ruled unanimously</a> last week that Johnson\u2019s decision to shut parliament for five weeks had been unlawful, and declared the prorogation null and void, MPs say there are signs of increasing desperation at No 10 as it faces the prospects of more defeats in parliament and the courts.</p> <p>On Saturday night, Johnson signalled that he would again challenge the judiciary by introducing US-style political screening of supreme court judges before they are appointed. Speaking to the <em>Sunday Telegraph</em>, the prime minister said: \u201cIf judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant.\u201d The Law Society and the Bar Council both said last week that politically appointed judges would threaten the independence of the judiciary.</p> <p>Some minor parties are pressing hard to pass a motion censuring Johnson, forcing him to apologise for the language he has used against his Brexit opponents. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville-Roberts has even asked Speaker John Bercow whether she can table a motion to impeach Johnson. Another avenue being examined is to censure Johnson should he appear before the liaison committee of MPs.</p> <p>Last week the former Tory prime minister John Major said he feared the Johnson government would try to bypass the Benn Act through an order of council. \u201cIt is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving HM the Queen,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget.\u201d</p> <p>The Civil Contingencies Act provides the government with powers to create emergency regulations at times of national crisis and threats to safety (including wartime), emergencies that threaten \u201cserious damage to human welfare\u201d, or to the environment or the security of the UK. Damage to human welfare is defined in the act to include disruption to transport networks or to the supply of food, money, energy, or health services.</p> <p>Downing St sources said it was not planning to use the Civil Contingencies Act. A spokesman added: \u201cThe prime minister is determined to deliver Brexit on time and he will abide by the law.\u201d</p> <p>Senior Labour sources played down suggestions by the Scottish National Party that the opposition parties could this week table a vote no confidence in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, with a view to installing a caretaker administration led by Jeremy Corbyn who would then apply for an extension to Brexit and call an election.</p> <p>While Labour is not publicly ruling out the move, shadow cabinet members privately say they will only move once an extension to Brexit has been guaranteed. The Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties, as well as former Tory MPs and independents, say they will not under any circumstances agree to install Corbyn in Downing Street, even temporarily.</p> <p>Anna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group for Change, which has five MPs, said: \u201cWe need to keep the prime minister held firmly accountable for the mess he has created. We do not want any votes of no confidence until that extension is up and running and even then I will only support a vote of no confidence knowing that it will result in a government of national unity resulting in a people\u2019s vote confirmatory referendum.</p> <p>\u201cAnything else gives Johnson his escape route. His only plan B is a general election and a general election would not solve Brexit. Only a referendum will sort out Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday the Liberal Democrats announced that Dr Phillip Lee, who recently defected from the Tories, will be their candidate to fight the veteran Tory and hard-line Brexiter John Redwood in Wokingham, to set up a Leave v Remain contest in the Berkshire seat. </p>",

Starmer told the Observer that Downing Street\u2019s strategy was clearly to stoke tensions but he warned Johnson that any attempt to invoke the Civil Contingencies Act would be defeated in the courts. \u201cWhipping up the idea of riots or even deaths if we do not leave the EU on 31 October is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cBut it is also pretty obviously being orchestrated. If this is part of a government plan to misuse powers under emergency legislation, I can assure the prime minister we will defeat him in court and in parliament.\u201d Johnson is expected to continue his attacks on Remainers this week at the Tory conference in Manchester where the slogan will be \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d. Former Tory MP and attorney general Dominic Grieve said he could see no other possible way Downing Street could comply with the law and deliver Brexit on time. \u201cThe Civil Contingencies Act is the only possible route I can imagine they can be thinking of,\u201d Grieve said. \u201cBut if they do try to do this it would be a constitutional outrage. And if it passed through parliament it would be immediately challenged in the courts.\u201d Allies of Johnson have warned in recent days that the UK will face civil disorder on the scale of the gilets jaunes protests in France if Brexit were to be delayed or reversed. Senior Labour sources said that possible use of the Civil Contingencies Act to trump the Benn act was on a list of options that the party\u2019s legal advisers believe Downing Street might use. After 11 supreme court judges ruled unanimously last week that Johnson\u2019s decision to shut parliament for five weeks had been unlawful, and declared the prorogation null and void, MPs say there are signs of increasing desperation at No 10 as it faces the prospects of more defeats in parliament and the courts. On Saturday night, Johnson signalled that he would again challenge the judiciary by introducing US-style political screening of supreme court judges before they are appointed. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, the prime minister said: \u201cIf judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant.\u201d The Law Society and the Bar Council both said last week that politically appointed judges would threaten the independence of the judiciary. Some minor parties are pressing hard to pass a motion censuring Johnson, forcing him to apologise for the language he has used against his Brexit opponents. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville-Roberts has even asked Speaker John Bercow whether she can table a motion to impeach Johnson. Another avenue being examined is to censure Johnson should he appear before the liaison committee of MPs. Last week the former Tory prime minister John Major said he feared the Johnson government would try to bypass the Benn Act through an order of council. \u201cIt is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving HM the Queen,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget.\u201d The Civil Contingencies Act provides the government with powers to create emergency regulations at times of national crisis and threats to safety (including wartime), emergencies that threaten \u201cserious damage to human welfare\u201d, or to the environment or the security of the UK. Damage to human welfare is defined in the act to include disruption to transport networks or to the supply of food, money, energy, or health services. Downing St sources said it was not planning to use the Civil Contingencies Act. A spokesman added: \u201cThe prime minister is determined to deliver Brexit on time and he will abide by the law.\u201d Senior Labour sources played down suggestions by the Scottish National Party that the opposition parties could this week table a vote no confidence in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, with a view to installing a caretaker administration led by Jeremy Corbyn who would then apply for an extension to Brexit and call an election. While Labour is not publicly ruling out the move, shadow cabinet members privately say they will only move once an extension to Brexit has been guaranteed. The Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties, as well as former Tory MPs and independents, say they will not under any circumstances agree to install Corbyn in Downing Street, even temporarily. Anna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group for Change, which has five MPs, said: \u201cWe need to keep the prime minister held firmly accountable for the mess he has created. We do not want any votes of no confidence until that extension is up and running and even then I will only support a vote of no confidence knowing that it will result in a government of national unity resulting in a people\u2019s vote confirmatory referendum. \u201cAnything else gives Johnson his escape route. His only plan B is a general election and a general election would not solve Brexit. Only a referendum will sort out Brexit.\u201d On Saturday the Liberal Democrats announced that Dr Phillip Lee, who recently defected from the Tories, will be their candidate to fight the veteran Tory and hard-line Brexiter John Redwood in Wokingham, to set up a Leave v Remain contest in the Berkshire seat.",

Additionally, Pep Guardiola may approach Goodison Park this evening with a little trepidation, given an early version of his City side went down here 4-0 just a couple of years ago, the worst league defeat of his entire managerial career. So you never know. Twenty-four goals in six games, though. Twenty-four!</p> <p><strong>Can City close the gap at the top on Liverpool? </strong>Or will Everton do themselves - and their Merseyside rivals - a solid? It\u2019s set up deliciously.

      "bodyText": "Paul Wilson was our man at Goodison. Here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM! And that\u2019s that! City close the gap at the top to five points, though they had to work hard for the win. Everton sit in 15th spot, just a couple of points above the bottom three. But their much-improved display this evening will surely have bought Marco Silva a little time and goodwill. Won\u2019t it? 90 min +4: Pickford races out of his area and is beaten to the ball by Bernardo Silva, who can\u2019t quite steer it into the empty net. Pickford smiles wryly, causing Sky co-commentator Gary Neville to burst a blood vessel. \u201cWhy is he laughing?! He should have saved City\u2019s second goal and he\u2019s nearly cost his team a fourth!\u201d Never change, Gary. 90 min +3: Everton win a throw deep in City territory down the left. Digne flings it long. It\u2019s easily cleared. 90 min +2: Bernardo Silva is sent clear down the left by his namesake David. He tries to float a chip over the stranded Pickford but sends the ball over the bar. Ah, he was offside anyway. 90 min +1: Kean does exceptionally well to keep a long ball down the right in play, then earns a corner. Nothing much happens at the set piece, so all that hard work was for nought. Everton\u2019s evening in microcosm. 90 min: There will be a minimum of four added minutes. 89 min: A bit of space for Sigurdsson, 25 yards out. But he can\u2019t control and the ball squirms through to Ederson. The keeper, so often a virtual spectator, has really had to do his bit today. 88 min: What character City have displayed today. They\u2019ve not been at their best, giving up a tranche of chances, but they\u2019ve dug in and this is going to be a huge three points. That rare thing: a win they\u2019ve had to fight for. 86 min: Sterling departs a hero. He\u2019s replaced by David Silva. Mahrez dribbles with great purpose down the right. Aguero takes over near the byline and crosses. Pickford kicks away, but only to Sterling, six yards out, Sterling nearly misses, leaning back and blootering the ball off the underside of the post. But itbounces down and over the line. Game over! 83 min: Mina once again rises highest, but sends a tame header straight at Ederson, who looks fine after that injury scare. 82 min: Some neat work by Kean out on the right. He flicks Coleman away. Coleman reaches the area, but pauses and allows Sterling to get back at him, and block his attempted cross out for a corner. 81 min: Schneiderlin is replaced by Tom Davies, who has form against City. 80 min: Bernardo Silva comes on for De Bruyne. Before the match restarts, Ederson needs some treatment, having hurt his hand making that save, though he looks fit to continue. 79 min: ... Mina so nearly scores. He rises highest in the box and heads down towards the bottom left. Ederson gets a strong hand to the ball and pushes it out right. What a save! Calvert-Lewin, from an offside position and a tight angle, shanks the ball out for a goal kick. 78 min: This match is still being played at 101 miles per hour. A lot of scrappy challenges going in. It\u2019s a bit of a mess again, but that might suit Everton, not least because it\u2019s got the crowd going again. Kean barges down the right and wins a corner. From which ... 76 min: Nearly! Nearly! Sigurdsson clips a pass down the inside-left channel to release Calvert-Lewin into the area. Calvert-Lewin looks to clip over the advancing Ederson and into the net, but the keeper spreads and deflects the ball away with his thigh. The resulting corner is a whole load of nothing. 75 min: Iwobi is replaced by Kean. The substitute substituted, though he was on so early that surely doesn\u2019t count as the usual embarrassment. Can Everton come back a second time? 74 min: And all of a sudden, City look much calmer and happier within themselves. Aguero skitters in from the left wing and launches a heatseeker towards the top right. It\u2019s inches away from planting itself in the corner. That would have been one hell of a goal. 73 min: City exploded in collective joy after that free kick. Seems silly to say when September\u2019s not even out, but that could prove a big goal in their title defence. Mina is booked for a fairly basic clatter into De Bruyne. He can have no complaints. It\u2019s a free kick just to the right of the D. Mahrez takes and curls one into the bottom left! It\u2019s perfectly placed, though Pickford should at least have got a hand on it. 69 min: Walker, deep on the right, crosses for Sterling, who times his run to get clear of the Everton back line. But in attempting to chest down, he only cushions the ball back to Pickford. Sterling might have been offside anyway, but the miss caused him much angst. 68 min: Aguero drops deep and fizzes a pass down the left for Sterling, who exchanges passes with Gundogan and cuts infield. But Everton hold their shape. City probe again, and a cross is half-cleared to Sterling on the edge of the box. For a second it looks as though there\u2019s time to get a shot away, but he\u2019s quickly submerged in a sea of royal blue. Everton block and clear. 66 min: Gundogan goes tearing towards the Everton defence and slips Jesus free with a pass down the inside right. But Jesus went too soon, needlessly so, and the flag goes up. It\u2019s Jesus\u2019 last act of the evening, as he\u2019s replaced by Sergio Aguero. 64 min: City win a corner down the left. The set piece is worked this way and that, and eventually leads to Mahrez ballooning a cross into the stand behind the goal. On the touchline, Pep throws semaphore shapes of great discontent. 62 min: Zinchenko clumsily bundles Richarlison to the ground. Gundogan is on hand to clear the resulting free kick. Then Coleman nearly sells Pickford short with a hospital backpass, but the keeper gets there just in time, ahead of Jesus, and hoicks clear. This match is a shapeless mess, and great entertainment as a result. Pep, that lover of control, must be doing his nut. 60 min: Mahrez, quarterbacking 35 yards out, slips Sterling clean free into the box with a lovely sliderule pass down the middle. Sterling pokes past the outrushing Pickford ... but well wide right! What a miss. Goodness. This match is quite something. Good luck predicting how it ends. 59 min: Schneiderlin scythes through De Bruyne, who was jinking elegantly down the left. That\u2019s an appalling act of cynicism, and the Everton player is correctly booked. De Bruyne is livid, though, wagging his finger in Schneiderlin\u2019s face. Schneiderlin slaps his hand away a couple of times. For a second, it looks like it\u2019s about to kick off bigstyle, but the referee calms it down. 58 min: This is a great match. Both teams are really going for it, both teams are backing themselves. So it\u2019s a glorious end-to-end affair. This surely can\u2019t end 1-1. 56 min: The resulting corner sees City tear away en masse on the break. The move breaks down, and Everton counter the counter. Richarlison chases a ball down the right and is kicked in the face by a falling Fernandinho. An accident, though Fernandinho was definitely making sure he got his body in the way of the Everton striker, so there was a level of cynicism in the challenge. Luckily for City, the referee sees nothing in it. We play on. 54 min: Zinchenko shoulders Richarlison in the back, and out of play on the right. He\u2019s fortunate to escape a booking. But this is a set piece in a dangerous position. Digne whips it in viciously. Mina should score, free, from six yards, but he heads down and allows Ederson to tip over. What an opportunity. A fine reactive save, but he should never have been allowed to make it. 53 min: Both teams are snapping into the tackles right now. This match hasn\u2019t been bad tempered, the Sterling-Mina rumpus apart. But it might not take too much to ignite the atmosphere. 51 min: Otamendi is booked for a cynical check on Calvert-Lewin, who was making good down the right. A free kick and a chance for Everton to load the box. Sigurdsson whips it in. Richarlison meets it, ten yards out, but can\u2019t keep his header down. The ball flies harmlessly over the crossbar. 49 min: City have come out with renewed vigour. Mahrez slips De Bruyne into the box on the right. Digne dives in rashly. De Bruyne could easily have instigated contact and gone over, but instead of looking for a cheap penalty, he stays on his feet and hammers a shot ... into the side netting. Lucky Digne. And credit to De Bruyne for his sporting approach to life. 47 min: City hog the ball in the early exchanges of this second half. Pass, pass, passity, pass. Then suddenly De Bruyne fires a crossfield ball to Sterling out on the left. Sterling finds Gundogan in the box, and for a split second, there\u2019s a route to goal. He opens his body and sidefoots towards the top right, but Keane closes the door at the last second and Everton clear. That would have been a quite lovely goal. Here we go, then. Everton get the second half underway. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Football\u2019s a game of two halves, and that was a half of three thirds. City dominated at the start and at the end. In the middle, their defence allowed Everton back into the game. You\u2019d still have City as favourites to grab the win in the second half, but Everton will fancy their chances of an upset as well. Poised nicely for the second half, in other words. 45 min +5: Mahrez crosses deep from the right. Sterling wins a header at the far post, but he\u2019d been tugging away at Coleman\u2019s shirt. Everton have done so well to get back into this game, but they need to hear the half-time whistle because City are beginning to build up a head of steam again. 45 min +4: Sterling whistles a low cross through Everton\u2019s box from the left. There\u2019s nobody there in Fruit Salad. The ball\u2019s recycled from the right wing, then Rodri tees up Gundogan, who shoots towards the top right. Pickford is in the right place to gather. 45 min +2: Sterling curls one in from the left. Mina does just about enough to put off Jesus, who was looking for a second headed goal. Pickford claims. 45 min: There will be six additional minutes, a legacy of Walcott\u2019s early injury. 44 min: So having said attacking wasn\u2019t so easy for City now, they put together a lovely move. Mahrez and De Bruyne work the ball right to left. Mahrez slips Jesus in, down the flank. Jesus blazes the ball over the bar with only Pickford to beat. Wild. In the centre, Sterling and Mina tangle, before exchanging views sharply. It all calms down quickly enough. 43 min: Sterling probes down the left, but all of a sudden attacking isn\u2019t quite so easy for City as it had been during the opening 25 minutes or so. He\u2019s turned back up the flank and away from danger. 41 min: Everton suddenly look a different team - and City are giving up chances. Iwobi, making his presence felt in the middle of the park, floats a simple ball forward, and suddenly it\u2019s dropping towards Sigurdsson, scampering through the huge hole between Fernandinho and Otamendi! He should probably attempt to head over the onrushing Ederson, but opts for a swivel and scissor kick instead, and that allows the keeper to sort the situation out. 39 min: Rodri is booked for bundling Calvert-Lewin to the ground in the midfield. He took one for the team there, because Everton were on the rampage, a move started by a fine burst from Richarlison down the right. The resulting free kick leads to nothing. 37 min: Credit to Everton, who responded so positively to the opening goal. They\u2019re giving City a game now ... and the crowd are getting into this. A magic atmosphere at Goodison. 35 min: City could easily have been three or four up. But now look! City\u2019s soft centre has been exposed again. Coleman\u2019s dink would have gone in anyway, but a striker\u2019s a striker\u2019s a striker, and you wouldn\u2019t have expected Calvert-Lewin to do anything else. Sigurdsson crosses from the right. Fernandinho slices his clearance straight to Iwobi, who bustles on the penalty spot. The ball is shoved right to Coleman, who from a tight angle draws Ederson and chips delicately over the keeper! Calvert-Lewin makes sure by Keith Houchen-ing the ball into the net, just before it crosses the line. Well, well! 32 min: Pickford flaps at De Bruyne\u2019s right-wing cross. Sterling picks up the pieces and tees up Mahrez on the edge of the area. Mahrez should do better than send a pea-roller into the hands of the grateful keeper. 31 min: Keane tries to release Coleman down the right with a pass along the channel. He thunks it straight out of play for a goal kick. The crowd groan, and groan loud. 29 min: To be fair to Everton, they\u2019re asking City some questions up the other end of the park. Sigurdsson plays a high ball into the box from the right, forcing Ederson to punch clear in a slightly panicked fashion. But then City go up the other end and nearly score a second, Sterling slipping a pass to Mahrez down the right, Mahrez shooting low and hard, Pickford getting in the road and turning the ball away. 27 min: Fernandinho is dictating the game from the back. He sprays a delightful pass towards De Bruyne on the left wing. De Bruyne takes his eye off the ball and it slips under his foot and out of play. Had he been concentrating, he\u2019d have been in an awful lot of space. Everton need to take care here, because they could be on the end of a hiding if they\u2019re not careful. 26 min: Everton try to hit back immediately, Sigurdsson launching a low fizzer towards the bottom left from 20 yards. It stings Ederson\u2019s hands, and the keeper spills, but Iwobi can\u2019t get to the loose ball before the keeper reclaims. Mahrez knocks the ball past Digne on the right and tears after it. He lays off to De Bruyne, who wedges gracefully towards the far post, where Jesus gets ahead of Keane and Mina and heads simply past a sprawling Pickford from six yards. It had been coming. 23 min: Digne crosses from the left. Sigurdsson tries to sidefoot into the bottom right, but his effort is instantly blocked by Otamendi. City\u2019s defence nearly exposed. 22 min: Mahrez looks in the mood today. Fernandinho hits long. Out on the right touchline, he kung-fu kicks a first-time pass towards De Bruyne in the PlayStation style, and very nearly releases his team-mate. Nearly. Not quite. So nearly something very special. 20 min: Walker is sent wheeching down the right by Mahrez, and earns himself a corner off Mina. Everton have conceded 20 goals from set pieces since the start of last season, the worst record in the division. They don\u2019t embellish that here, the resulting corner a bit of a non-event. But the sense that it\u2019s just a matter of time before City open the scoring is palpable. 19 min: City have been coming at Everton in a manner most relentless. So there\u2019s a bit of relief for the home side as De Bruyne uncharacteristically sends a long pass, intended for Sterling on the left, out of play for a goal kick. And breathe. 17 min: Sterling isn\u2019t so shabby on the other wing, mind. He was quite sensational against Preston in the League Cup, and now he\u2019s tormenting Coleman on the left wing. He reaches the byline and fires a low ball across the face of goal. Mina, facing the wrong way, does extremely well to swivel and clear off the line. Especially when you consider that earlier shank. 16 min: Fernandinho picks out Mahrez down the right with an exquisite long pass. Digne does just enough to stop him racing into the box and achieving goodness knows what. Everton are all over the place down this flank. Mahrez and De Bruyne are having a lot of joy. 14 min: Richarlison dribbles in from the right and reaches the box. He\u2019s ushered back out of it by Fernandinho, though too strongly; he\u2019s nudged to the ground the second he\u2019s out of the area. A free kick in a very dangerous position. Digne blasts it witlessly into the stand. 12 min: De Bruyne comes at Everton down the right. They\u2019re enjoying so much space down this flank. He lashes hard and low towards the near post. Pickford hacks away with his feet. 11 min: A surreal passage of play begins as Mahrez crosses from the right. The ball should be cleared easily by Mina, but the defender shanks it straight back to Mahrez, who crosses again. It\u2019s a sensational cross that finds Gundogan free at the far post, six yards out. Gundogan has to score, but he leans back and sidefoots the ball off the crossbar! How on earth did he manage to miss that?! 10 min: Everton launch their first meaningful attack down the right. Some neat work by Sigurdsson and Calvert-Lewin sets Coleman scampering towards the byline, but the full-back\u2019s cutback isn\u2019t any good. City clear their lines. 9 min: The game restarts, and De Bruyne drives down the right. Delph does extremely well to ensure his former City team-mate can\u2019t get a cross or shot away upon reaching the box. 7 min: Iwobi comes on in Walcott\u2019s place. 6 min: That looked so innocuous at first, but the ball - whipped in with great pace by Sterling - caught Walcott flush on the back of his head as he turned. A terrible whack. No blame at all on Sterling, of course. Just awful luck. A warm round of sympathetic applause from all corners of the stadium as he\u2019s carried to the nearest ambulance. 4 min: Walcott is really groggy. He\u2019s struggling to sit upright, and won\u2019t be able to continue. The ambulance crew are taking care as they load him onto the stretcher. 2 min: An early problem for Walcott, who is flat on his back in his own penalty area, having taken a whack to the head. Sterling whipped in a cross, and it smacked him on the back of the head from close range. He sits up, but looks extremely groggy as a result. City get the ball rolling! They\u2019re kicking towards the Gwladys Street end in this first half. And within 45 seconds, Mahrez screams in from the right and curls low and hard towards the bottom left. Pickford gets down to parry clear. An early shot across Everton\u2019s bows. The teams are out! Everton are in their famous royal blue, while Manchester City sport their third-choice Barratt\u2019s Fruit Salad homage. Z Cars has been blasted out of the PA, the crowd are giving it plenty, and we\u2019ll be off in a minute! Pep talks. \u201cWe have made four changes, and the next one will be changes again. I try for everybody to be involved. Eight points is a big gap already. We face a team [Liverpool] that lost one game last season, so I don\u2019t see them dropping too many with the quality they have. And when they don\u2019t play to a high level they always win. But we are in September so there are a lot of games left.\u201d Marco Silva is in bullish mood. \u201cStrikers need goals for confidence, so now is the moment for Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He can play a key part in the game. We started that game against Sheffield United after six wins in a row at home; that means what we were doing at home was really good. Of course we had a bad game. But it is up to us to show a reaction. Goodison will be with a fantastic atmosphere, and the fans will expect a good performance. We have the desire to achieve a good result, while of course respecting our opponent.\u201d The earlier results add a little more spice to this match. Manchester City are now eight points behind Liverpool, who won narrowly at Sheffield United. They could very much do with winning this game in hand. Everton meanwhile have slipped to 15th place, but victory tonight would launch them into the top half, tenth to be precise. Marco Silva makes two changes to Everton\u2019s last Premier League selection. Theo Walcott and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the latter having scored twice in the League Cup during the week, replace Moise Kean and Bernard. Pep Guardiola makes four changes to the side that routed Watford in the league last week. Ilkay Gundogan, Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko come in for Bernardo Silva, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Benjamin Mendy. Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Mina, Digne, Schneiderlin, Delph, Walcott, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Holgate, Tosun, Iwobi, Davies, Kean, Lossl, Sidibe. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Zinchenko, Rodri, Gundogan, Mahrez, De Bruyne, Sterling, Gabriel Jesus. Subs: Bravo, Aguero, Bernardo Silva, Silva, Mendy, Joao Cancelo, Foden. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Manchester City have scored 24 goals in the Premier League already this season. That\u2019s taken six matches. At a rate of four goals a game. Everton are hereby permitted to take one hard, loud, long, theatrical gulp. Not least because their last two performances in the league have been poor. A quiet capitulation at Bournemouth, a miserable struggle against Sheffield United at home. A midweek cakewalk at Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup has given under-fire Marco Silva some breathing room, though few expect his team, very much a work in progress, to beat the champions tonight. They\u2019re 9-1 against, on their own turf. But this is football, and there\u2019s always hope. It\u2019s not as though Everton are desperately short of talent, and these guys have surely got to click into life sometime. Additionally, Pep Guardiola may approach Goodison Park this evening with a little trepidation, given an early version of his City side went down here 4-0 just a couple of years ago, the worst league defeat of his entire managerial career. So you never know. Twenty-four goals in six games, though. Twenty-four! Can City close the gap at the top on Liverpool? Or will Everton do themselves - and their Merseyside rivals - a solid? It\u2019s set up deliciously. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, following reports that he used the power of his office to solicit interference by a foreign government in the 2020 US election, makes him only the fourth president in US history to have this notable distinction, with Bill Clinton in 1998, Richard Nixon in 1973 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. The picture changes by the hour, but the main story concerns Trump\u2019s apparent offer to Ukraine\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\" title=\"\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, to unfreeze $400m in (Congress-approved) military aid if he would investigate Joe Biden, the current frontrunner in the Democratic primaries.</p> <p>The conversation so shocked a member of the intelligence community that they filed an official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/trump-ukraine-scandal-zelenskiy-biden-hunter\" title=\"\">whistleblower complaint</a>. The White House then appears to have engaged in a cover-up, in part by keeping these conversations from officials who would normally have access to them, as well as allegedly moving the transcript of the call to a secret computer system (the Presidential Records Act of 1978, passed in response to the Watergate scandal, mandates that all presidential records must be officially preserved).</p> <p>Since the Democrats took majority control of the House of Representatives in January, Pelosi\u2019s caucus has been under intense pressure from some to impeach Trump, based on his first two years in office, beginning with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/29/james-comey-justice-department-watchdog-fbi-violations\" title=\"\">firing of James Comey</a> as FBI director to thwart investigations into his own activities. Others urged caution, for several reasons. Some pointed out that article II of the US constitution specifies impeachment requires \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and that what constitutes \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d remains a subject of debate.</p> <p>In practice, the House gets to decide, but it must tread warily. For example, in 1868 it charged Johnson with 11 articles of impeachment, including contempt of Congress, and \u201cbringing disgrace and ridicule to the presidency\u201d. While it is tempting to ponder Trump being impeached for bringing disgrace and ridicule to the presidency, it is hard to see the Senate being convinced.

      "bodyText": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, following reports that he used the power of his office to solicit interference by a foreign government in the 2020 US election, makes him only the fourth president in US history to have this notable distinction, with Bill Clinton in 1998, Richard Nixon in 1973 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. The picture changes by the hour, but the main story concerns Trump\u2019s apparent offer to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to unfreeze $400m in (Congress-approved) military aid if he would investigate Joe Biden, the current frontrunner in the Democratic primaries. The conversation so shocked a member of the intelligence community that they filed an official whistleblower complaint. The White House then appears to have engaged in a cover-up, in part by keeping these conversations from officials who would normally have access to them, as well as allegedly moving the transcript of the call to a secret computer system (the Presidential Records Act of 1978, passed in response to the Watergate scandal, mandates that all presidential records must be officially preserved). Since the Democrats took majority control of the House of Representatives in January, Pelosi\u2019s caucus has been under intense pressure from some to impeach Trump, based on his first two years in office, beginning with his firing of James Comey as FBI director to thwart investigations into his own activities. Others urged caution, for several reasons. Some pointed out that article II of the US constitution specifies impeachment requires \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and that what constitutes \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d remains a subject of debate. In practice, the House gets to decide, but it must tread warily. For example, in 1868 it charged Johnson with 11 articles of impeachment, including contempt of Congress, and \u201cbringing disgrace and ridicule to the presidency\u201d. While it is tempting to ponder Trump being impeached for bringing disgrace and ridicule to the presidency, it is hard to see the Senate being convinced. Historically, other impeachment articles have included abuse of power, lying under oath, and obstruction of justice, all of which are likely to hold more sway with both the Senate and the American public. Nor does impeaching Trump guarantee his removal: Clinton and Johnson were both impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate. (Impeachment works like a trial, with the House prosecuting, the chief justice of the supreme court presiding, and the Senate as jury voting whether to convict.)The House only needs a simple majority to pass articles of impeachment, but conviction requires a two-thirds Senate majority: 67 votes. No US president has ever been removed by Senate vote, and Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate has, thus far, implacably voted along party lines to protect Trump.

      "bodyText": "Championship Leeds blew the chance to go top of the division and instead ended the day in fourth after they suffered their first away defeat of the season in losing 1-0 to Charlton. An unwitting Macauley Bonne scored the first-half winner when the ball bounced off him after Kiko Casilla had deflected Tom Lockyer\u2019s shot into the Zimbabwe international. Marcelo Bielsa made two half-time substitutions but his rejigging of personnel and tactics could not find an equaliser. West Brom stayed top having won 2-0 at QPR in the earlier match, after Swansea drew 1-1 with Reading after being denied three points by Andy Yiadom equalised in the last minute. Borja Bast\u00f3n had given Swansea a third-minute lead they could not hold on to. Derby\u2019s week ended with a first win of the season since the opening day, with Jamie Paterson\u2019s 74th-minute breakaway goal the winner in a 3-2 defeat of Birmingham. Neither Mason Bennett nor Tom Lawrence were named in Philip Cocu\u2019s squad, having been charged this week with drink-driving for the crash that has ruled out club captain Richard Keogh with a serious knee injury. Derby were 2-0 up after goals from Chris Martin and Martyn Waghorn but goals in quick succession from Gary Gardner and Ivan Sunjic levelled matters. Lukas Jutkiewicz had chance to put the Blues into the lead but his penalty was saved by Kelle Roos. Preston might have ended the day in an automatic promotion slot but drew 3-3 with Bristol City, having had to fight back from 2-0 and 3-2 down. Patrick Bauer\u2019s header with 20 minutes to play set up a grandstand finish but neither side could find a winner. Preston are fifth, City eighth. Sheffield Wednesday are a place out of the play-offs after a rousing 4-1 win at struggling Middlesbrough. The Owls scored in the fifth and sixth minutes through Adam Clayton\u2019s own-goal and Dominic Iorfa\u2019s header before Paddy McNair briefly brought Boro into the game with a 19th-minute header.

League One Ipswich stayed top after a 4-1 defeat of Tranmere, who had gone into the break level at 1-1 after Stefan Payne\u2019s equaliser. A mistake from Tranmere goalkeeper Scott Davies gifted Ipswich back the lead when Kayden Jackson scored from close range before goals from Jon Nolan and Kane Vincent-Young ended the contest. The pressure was lifted on Sunderland manager Jack Ross by a 2-1 defeat of MK Dons after Max Power opened the scoring with a tremendous first-time finish in the 24th minute. Luke O\u2019Nien doubled the lead before George Williams set nerves jangling in the 55th minute. Another manager under pressure, Portsmouth\u2019s Kenny Jackett, could feel relief after his team\u2019s 1-0 defeat of bottom club Bolton, with Brett Pitman grabbing the winner after Pompey\u2019s players had been booed from the field at half-time. AFC Wimbledon remain second-bottom after losing 3-2 at Peterborough, the visitors\u2019 first match since Wimbledon manager Wally Downes was suspended by the club after an FA charge for betting breaches. Oxford United followed up their midweek humbling of West Ham with a 3-0 defeat of Gillingham while Wycombe stayed in the top two with their 3-0 win at Rochdale. League Two Exeter retain their leadership but their 3-1 home loss to Grimsby concertinaed the promotion picture. Crewe and Cheltenham, in second and third, blew the chance to clamber above Exeter when they were only able to draw 1-1. Crewe had to play out the last 20 minutes with 10 men after Perry Ng received his second yellow card. Forest Green, in fourth, are level on points with Cheltenham after putting Salford to the sword with a 4-0 away win that included a Matty Stevens double. Swindon are back in fifth after losing 2-0 at Newport, who moved into sixth.",

      "bodyText": "Liverpool\u2019s latest title challenge has begun in formidable and often near flawless fashion but their seventh successive Premier League win came riddled with imperfections, reminding everyone that they are mortal after all. A week after winning at Everton, Sheffield United revelled in going toe to toe with the European champions and seemed set to collect a point before a ghastly, freakish, goalkeeping error on the part of the previously underemployed Dean Henderson gifted Gini Wijnaldum the winning goal. It was Liverpool\u2019s first victory here since 1990 and they are unlikely to forget it in a hurry. Along the way J\u00fcrgen Klopp was forced to make changes to formation and personnel as his side struggled to preserve their 100% League record. \u201cHad it been a draw I would have said it was what both teams deserved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unlucky for Sheffield United, for sure. \u201cWe were playing against a proper unit with the team, the manager and the crowd all making it feel as if you were playing against a wall. I was very impressed. The way they fight and play reminded me of my old team at Mainz. They do so many really good little things.\u201d If Liverpool had expected Sheffield United\u2019s overlapping centre-halves to retreat into their shells, they were swiftly disabused as Jack O\u2019Connell, the left-sided element of the defensive trinity, pressed forward and Enda Stevens, the left wing-back, repeatedly accelerated into the space left behind Trent Alexander-Arnold. While Chris Wilder had clearly identified Liverpool\u2019s right-back as a weak defensive link, Stevens shone. As a former centre-half, the watching Gareth Southgate probably enjoyed the no-quarter-given duel involving Oli McBurnie \u2013 whose bristling ginger beard seems somehow emblematic of his invariably feisty interpretation of the centre-forward role \u2013 and Virgil van Dijk. Although the much lauded centre-half held his own, he will certainly have had more comfortable afternoons. Southgate had driven down from his North Yorkshire home to watch contenders for his England squad, perhaps including George Baldock, Sheffield United\u2019s right wing-back whose private duel with Andy Robertson would assume increasing importance. It did not take long to realise that, like Alexander-Arnold, Robertson could not exert his usual influence. Although Liverpool dominated possession, the home side counterattacked cleverly. Only Jo\u00ebl Matip\u2019s interception kept McBurnie at bay and Callum Robinson missed a couple of chances as Liverpool struggled for fluency.

Yet amid the danger, McBurnie drew a good save from Adri\u00e1n while only Van Dijk\u2019s interception came between John Lundstram and a goal. No one guessed calamity of the cruellest order beckoned for Henderson. For much of the afternoon Wijnaldum\u2019s performance had been regressively reminiscent of his once routinely ineffective away displays at Newcastle but then the Dutchman met a headed clearance on the edge of the area and volleyed straight at Henderson. The keeper looked to have gathered routinely only for the ball slip from his fingers and through his legs before it slowly, agonisingly trickled across the line.

Henderson would soon save superbly from Salah but his manager clearly did not regard it as redemption. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a golden opportunity,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve let it slip through our hands.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Labour MP Stella Creasy has contacted the police and said she feels \u201cphysically sick\u201d after being targeted by an anti-abortion group. Creasy, who represents Walthamstow in parliament, expressed her concern as protesters entered her constituency and put a poster of her next to a picture of what it claimed was \u201ca 24-week-old aborted baby girl\u201d. The image reads: \u201cYour MP is working hard \u2026 to make this a human right.\u201d It also has the address for a website that has been set up against the MP. The protest and campaign was set up by an American anti-abortion organisation, the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform. It comes after MPs approved an amendment by Creasy to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK where it remains illegal. The vote was passed by 332 to 99. Creasy reported the campaign to the police. In a tweet she said: \u201cFeel physically sick.\u201d She added that the police said they would not use PSPO [public spaces protection orders] powers \u2013 used when a particular nuisance in a particular area that is having a detrimental effect on the quality of life \u2013 to move the protesters on.

I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s always having those eye-roll moments, looking down her glasses or taking a pointed sip of water, which the audience find satisfying. She\u2019s in the inner circle but slightly removed because she\u2019s not a member of the Roy family. Gerri\u2019s largely unflappable so it\u2019s fun to watch when she does react. And those reaction shots are pretty meme-friendly, as it turns out.</p> <p><strong>Are you getting recognised more as the show has taken off?</strong><br>Definitely. And <em>Succession</em> seems to have very diverse fans, which is great. I don\u2019t dress or wear my hair like Gerri, so sometimes at the end of a meal at a restaurant, the waitress will suddenly go: \u201cWait a minute, aren\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d It\u2019s often a slow dawning.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think season two is so much bigger than season one?</strong><br>Partly because the show very confidently took its time to set itself up. There are lots of layers to it and the style has this sort of cold objectivity. Jesse and the other writers relish the characters\u2019 foibles but don\u2019t glorify them. They show how awful they are but don\u2019t spell things out or over-explain. It\u2019s deftly done and finding that exact delicate tone took time.

Maybe it was too little too late but it was time to find a voice and connect with people. The global community felt in danger and it felt like social media could be used for good. It\u2019s also fun. There are a lot of witty people on Twitter. What makes you happy when you\u2019re not working? I\u2019m a big bookworm and love to read. I like baseball. I\u2019m currently looking at colleges with my daughter too, which is gratifying. You should dress as Gerri when you visit the colleges. Good idea! I might command some respect.

The Soviets didn\u2019t see much advantage in the airbases militarily, but finally accepted the idea, wanting to charm the British and Americans into opening a second front against the Germans.

But there is a lot in Russian history that helped Putin and those around him to make the choices they did. We are all going through the same moment in history, but I don\u2019t think the political DNA in Britain and the US will allow that moment to become more than just a moment.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Q: Which books would you recommend to help navigate the anxious yet exciting change to university?</strong> <br></h2> <p><em>Sophie Tice, 19, gap-year student, Cirencester, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p><strong>A: Alfie Packham, deputy editor of </strong><em><strong>Guardian Universities</strong></em><strong>, says:</strong></p> <p>Now is the ideal time to read widely and randomly, before you\u2019re tied down by compulsory reading lists. Fiction or non-fiction. Go bananas. You never know what stories and authors will stay with you. At 19, I remember latching on to Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\" title=\"\">The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</a></em>, a sad but uplifting novel partially set on a university campus. Something about this story of a \u201cfat Dominican nerd\u201d really spoke to me at the time, as a former <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/13/no-more-nerds-how-dungeons-dragons-became-cool-stranger-things-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Dungeons </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/13/no-more-nerds-how-dungeons-dragons-became-cool-stranger-things-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">&amp; </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/13/no-more-nerds-how-dungeons-dragons-became-cool-stranger-things-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Dragons</a></em> player.</p> <p>There are many \u201ccampus novels\u201d that you might find you can relate to at your stage in life. Sally Rooney\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/normal-people-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">Normal People</a></em> comes to mind. Both this and her first book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">Conversations </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">With Friends</a>,</em> are full of erudite young women, whose relationships are complicated and engrossing.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the witty <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/10/fiction.zadiesmith\" title=\"\">On Beauty</a></em> by Zadie Smith, set in a fictional American university. In these self-contained worlds, a novelist can explore the biggest themes: education, love, class, adulthood.</p> <p>And there are plenty from the last century that still hold up well. In John Williams\u2019s 1965 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/13/stoner-john-williams-julian-barnes\" title=\"\">Stoner</a></em>, the eponymous William Stoner moves away from his family\u2019s farm to the University of Missouri, where he falls in love with the study of literature. Maybe you\u2019ll find some common ground here, when you leave Gloucestershire. Evelyn Waugh\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/evelynwaugh.fiction\" title=\"\">Brideshead Revisited</a></em> is another classic of the genre.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/04/100-best-novels-no-85-the-bell-jar-sylvia-plath\" title=\"\">The Bell Jar</a></em> by Sylvia Plath famously captured the angst of a young person awaiting her future. At one point the protagonist, Esther Greenwood, imagines her life branching out before her like a fig tree. Each fig represents a different possibility: family life, lovers, careers, exciting travels. She writes: \u201cI wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\u201d</p> <p>And, in case you were after something more literal, there are some guides to university living, such as Lucy Tobin\u2019s <em>A Guide to Uni Life</em>, which includes loads of practical tips on getting started as a student. Best of luck.</p> <p><em>Submit your question to book clinic below, or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Book clinic question form\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/js.php/observer_book_clinic&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Q: Which books would you recommend to help navigate the anxious yet exciting change to university? Sophie Tice, 19, gap-year student, Cirencester, Gloucestershire A: Alfie Packham, deputy editor of Guardian Universities, says: Now is the ideal time to read widely and randomly, before you\u2019re tied down by compulsory reading lists. Fiction or non-fiction. Go bananas. You never know what stories and authors will stay with you. At 19, I remember latching on to Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, a sad but uplifting novel partially set on a university campus. Something about this story of a \u201cfat Dominican nerd\u201d really spoke to me at the time, as a former Dungeons &amp; Dragons player. There are many \u201ccampus novels\u201d that you might find you can relate to at your stage in life. Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People comes to mind. Both this and her first book, Conversations With Friends, are full of erudite young women, whose relationships are complicated and engrossing. Then there\u2019s the witty On Beauty by Zadie Smith, set in a fictional American university. In these self-contained worlds, a novelist can explore the biggest themes: education, love, class, adulthood. And there are plenty from the last century that still hold up well. In John Williams\u2019s 1965 novel Stoner, the eponymous William Stoner moves away from his family\u2019s farm to the University of Missouri, where he falls in love with the study of literature. Maybe you\u2019ll find some common ground here, when you leave Gloucestershire. Evelyn Waugh\u2019s Brideshead Revisited is another classic of the genre. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath famously captured the angst of a young person awaiting her future. At one point the protagonist, Esther Greenwood, imagines her life branching out before her like a fig tree. Each fig represents a different possibility: family life, lovers, careers, exciting travels. She writes: \u201cI wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\u201d And, in case you were after something more literal, there are some guides to university living, such as Lucy Tobin\u2019s A Guide to Uni Life, which includes loads of practical tips on getting started as a student. Best of luck. Submit your question to book clinic below, or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Senator Lindsey Graham, once among Donald Trump\u2019s harshest critics, is set to lead the charge to defend him in the court of public opinion as Democrats make the case for impeachment. The Republican senator from South Carolina has rejected the allegation that Trump betrayed America\u2019s national security interests by pressing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate political rival Joe Biden days after freezing some military aid to the country. Graham and other allies of the president have sought to fight back by arguing that a whistleblower who raised the alarm was not on the call between Trump and Zelenskiy but based his complaint on officials\u2019 recollections of it. \u201cIn America you can\u2019t even get a parking ticket based on hearsay testimony,\u201d Graham tweeted on Saturday. \u201cBut you can impeach a president? I certainly hope not.\u201d The senator played golf with Trump, as well as professionals Gary Player and Annika S\u00f6renstam, at the president\u2019s club in Sterling, Virginia on Saturday morning, according to a White House pool report. It seemed likely Trump and Graham had plenty of time to strategise how to reclaim the political narrative. Graham has changed his tune on impeachment. In 1998-99, as a member of the House of Representatives, he helped manage the impeachment of Democratic president Bill Clinton, insisting the process was \u201cabout restoring honor and integrity to the office\u201d. But Graham distinguished himself in Trump\u2019s eyes a year ago with his furious defence of Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination to the supreme court was almost derailed by allegations of sexual assault. On Friday the senator sent a fundraising email to supporters that said: \u201cI can still remember the exact moment it started, one year ago today \u2026 I spoke from the heart against the false and uncorroborated accusations leveled against Brett Kavanaugh for political purposes.\u201d Graham added: \u201cMy remarks on the Democrats\u2019 despicable treatment of Justice Kavanaugh had struck a powerful chord with folks who enthusiastically supported President Trump\u2019s pick to our nation\u2019s highest court.\u201d The email contained a photo of a smiling Graham with a distressed protester in the background, and the caption: \u201cStand with me against the left\u2019s angry mobs!\u201d Graham, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, will appear on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, along with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry given his attempts to pressure Ukraine. The New York Post\u2019s PageSix reported that Graham was overheard on a flight coordinating talking points with the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re told that the South Carolina pol was on a JetBlue flight from Washington DC, to Charleston and was chatting loudly with \u2018Jared\u2019 \u2013 presumably White House adviser Jared Kushner \u2013 before takeoff,\u201d it said. \u201cIt was a \u2018full-blown, loud conversation\u2019 according to an airborne spy. \u2018His phone rang and he answered, \u201cHey, Jared!\u201d He was \u2026 saying he\u2019s going to be on Face the Nation on Sunday. He said, \u201cListen \u2013 this is what I\u2019m going to lay out,\u201d\u2019 we\u2019re told.\u201d The report added that Graham was overheard saying: \u201cThis is Kavanaugh on steroids! This is hearsay \u2013 and this person has bias.\u201d Graham and others might find the Ukraine case tougher than Kavanaugh or the Mueller report, which summed up special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference, links between Trump and Moscow and possible obstruction of justice by the president. David Brock, a political activist and founder of the progressive watchdog Media Matters for America, told the Guardian: \u201cTheir playbook is very predictable. It\u2019s one we\u2019ve seen before.

They\u2019re certainly trying but I wonder about the effectiveness of it.\u201d Trump continued to punch back on Saturday, branding Democrats \u201csavages\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages \u2026 had a Republican party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me.

      "bodyText": "Backstage at Vivienne Westwood\u2019s Paris show the designer was in typically provocative mood, declaring: \u201cI am not sure how much longer fashion weeks will be feasible for, in the future.\u201d However, that designer was not Westwood herself but her husband, Andreas Kronthaler, who for the past three years has taken top billing at the Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood show. This label remains unmistakably Westwood. It retains both its distinctive look \u2013 think 18th-century French punk \u2013 and the environmental activism she embraced decades before it became acceptable, let alone fashionable, in mainstream culture. The Dame herself watched Saturday\u2019s show from the front row, and joined Kronthaler arm-in-arm for a catwalk lap of honour. \u201cWe have to take sustainability seriously,\u201d said Kronthaler before the show. \u201cI think that is obvious now, no? So I try to be as conscious and as careful as possible.\u201d Much of the raw material for this collection was \u201cfabrics that already exist \u2013 it\u2019s called deadstock, although I think that\u2019s a bit of a strange name\u201d. He worked with Wastemark to collect fabric surplus from top Italian mills, \u201cand mostly I didn\u2019t dye the fabric, just washed it and fitted it\u201d. This collection was called Rock me Amadeus. \u201cBut really, that\u2019s just about the hair,\u201d said Kronthaler, gesturing to model Bella Hadid, standing patiently in a swimsuit and knee-high sport socks while being accessorised for the catwalk with a vast Dr Seuss hat on top of hair neatly pinned into Mozart-esque rolls above the ears. \u201cI try to put as much into each look as I can. I want each look to be a world of its own.\u201d An oversized black net hat with an elegant elongated shape, somewhere between a very chic crocodile mask and an Admiral\u2019s bicorne hat, had in fact been inspired by rowers who Kronthaler saw carrying their upturned boats high above their heads into the Thames, on a visit to Henley. There were references to 1950s pin-ups and to Fellini\u2019s 1976 film Casanova. And there were plenty of party dresses in the classic Westwood style, with opulent layers unpeeling over bare shoulders, waists cinched with a corset, skirts flounced. \u201cWhat I believe is that we should buy less and really love the things that we buy,\u201d said Kronthaler. The son of a Tyrolean blacksmith, he met his wife in the late 1980s, when she was a professor at the Vienna Institute for Applied Art and he was her star pupil. Married since 1993, they have been a de facto design team for much of that time. In 2016, the name of the Paris fashion week show was changed to acknowledge Kronthaler\u2019s contribution.

If a team messes up the first leg of a cup tie and then roars back in the second to go through, then this would be a genuine sporting redemption.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a fair cop. <strike> I\u2019ll try to redeem myself by never doing it again. </strike></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8f7ea18f081108db9be837\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T15:39:23.885Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>GOAL!

Full time: Aston Villa 2-2 Burnley Full time: Wolves 2-0 Watford Wolves jump out of the relegation places after their first league win. Watford are bottom, and in bother. Full time: Crystal Palace 2-0 Norwich Palace move into the top half with a comfortable win. Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Southampton Peep peep! An important win for 10-man Spurs, who move up to fourth in the table. Poch out! Full time: Bournemouth 2-2 West Ham That was a cracking game, despite the best efforts of VAR. Full time: Rangers 5-0 Aberdeen Rangers move within a point of the leaders Celtic after a crushing victory. Andros Townsend seals victory for Palace with a nice finish. Norwich\u2019s desperate away form continues - played four, lost four. Full time: Chelsea 2-0 Brighton A good win for Chelsea, thanks to goals from Jorginho and Willian. A clean sheet will make Frank even happier. GOAL! Swansea 1-1 Reading (Yiadom 90) Swansea would have gone top of the table with a win. \u201cDundee United 6-0 Morton,\u201d weeps Simon McMahon. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good since Dave Narey scored for Scotland against Brazil in 1982.\u201d Bournemouth 2-2 West Ham Josh King has his shirt pulled in the West Ham penalty area. No penalty. This would be a terrific win for Spurs, given the week they\u2019ve had and the sending off of Serge Aurier in the first half. For all the negativity, Harry Kane looks in his best form since the 2017-18 season, and an in-form goalscorer can paper over a lot of cracks. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says David Reynolds. \u201cI don\u2019t know what makes sports reporters, so endlessly susceptible to describing something good being done after something bad as \u201credemption\u201d, but please please make it stop. All summer long, I have winced as Steve Smith playing excellent cricket has been repeatedly described as \u201credemption\u201d for him previously presiding over cheating, even though in no logical sense can the second act redeem the first. Even today, two Guardian MBMs have described a good save following a goalkeeping howler as \u201credemption\u201d, but the second could in no way alter the first, and this is simply not redemption. If a team messes up the first leg of a cup tie and then roars back in the second to go through, then this would be a genuine sporting redemption.\u201d It\u2019s a fair cop. I\u2019ll try to redeem myself by never doing it again. GOAL! Rangers 5-0 Aberdeen (Defoe 80) It\u2019s officially a shellacking. Well that didn\u2019t take long. The impressive John McGinn, who was VARed in the first half, has given Villa the lead against Burnley. \u201cCan someone please explain the point of Serge Aurier?\u201d says Ian Davis. \u201cHe\u2019s been a walking red card ever since he arrived at Spurs.\u201d I can\u2019t. You\u2019re welcome! West Ham have equalised in an excellent game at the Vitality Stadium. Aaron Cresswell scored with a deflected shot, his second goal in as many games. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 1-1 Burnley Bournemouth 2-1 West Ham Chelsea 2-0 Brighton Crystal Palace 1-0 Norwich Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Southampton Wolves 2-0 Watford Scottish Premiership Rangers 4-0 Aberdeen La Liga Getafe 0-2 Barcelona Bundesliga Paderborn 2-3 Bayern Munich (full time) Serie A Juventus 2-0 SPAL (full time) Championship Charlton 1-0 Leeds Swansea 1-0 Reading Preston 3-3 Bristol City League One Ipswich 4-1 Tranmere League Two Cheltenham Town 1-1 Crewe Alexandra You can see all the other latest scores here. It\u2019s been a nervous second half for Chelsea, but Willian\u2019s deflected shot should seal their first home win in the league under Frank Lampard\u2019s. Scottish Premiership James Tavernier has scored his second penalty for Rangers, who are walloping Aberdeen 4-0. Full time: Paderborn 2-3 Bayern Munich The substitute Jay Rodriguez equalises for Burnley with a smart header. GOAL! Preston 2-3 Bristol City (Baker 60) Nathan Baker restores Bristol City\u2019s lead; all three of their goals have come from set-pieces. Wolves are cruising towards their first league win of the season. An unfortunate own goal from Daryl Janmaat has doubled their lead, and that\u2019s all there is to it. Spurs 2-1 Southampton Hugo Lloris makes another outstanding save, this time from Maya Yoshida. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley Bournemouth 2-1 West Ham Chelsea 1-0 Brighton Crystal Palace 1-0 Norwich Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Southampton Wolves 1-0 Watford Scottish Premiership Rangers 3-0 Aberdeen La Liga Getafe 0-2 Barcelona Bundesliga Paderborn 2-3 Bayern Munich (2.30pm) Serie A Juventus 2-0 SPAL (final score) Championship Charlton 1-0 Leeds Swansea 1-0 Reading Preston 2-2 Bristol City League One Ipswich 2-1 Tranmere League Two Cheltenham Town 1-1 Crewe Alexandra You can see all the other latest scores here. GOAL! Paderborn 2-3 Bayern Munich (Collins 84) Paderborn won\u2019t go quietly. A long-range blooter from Jamilu Collins has brought them back into the game. Spurs 2-1 Southampton Hugo Lloris, who made an eejit of himself in the first half, makes a redemptive, brilliant save from James Ward-Prowse to keep Spurs ahead. Bournemouth 2-1 West Ham Nathan Ake has had a goal disallowed for offside. Meanwhile, Preston have equalised at home to Bristol City; it\u2019s 2-2. Both Preston goals came from the penalty spot, though they switched the taker for the second one. Crystal Palace 1-0 Norwich City \u201cRob, you perhaps haven\u2019t noticed that Norwich have suffered yet another injury, second choice keeper Fahrmann going off in the 22nd minute to be replaced by third choice McGovern,\u201d says Rod Wooden. \u201cAnd Fahrmann was making his debut \u2026\u201d Their injury list is brutal just now. I still think they will get enough points at home to stay up, although the away performances are a worry. GOAL! Dundee United 4-0 Morton (Shankland 56) That\u2019s Lawrence Shankland\u2019s hat-trick. Robert Lewandowski has ended the nonsense at Paderborn by restoring Bayern\u2019s two-goal lead. And Barcelona now lead Getafe 2-0 thanks to Junior Firpo. League One Kayden Jackson has made it Ipswich 2-1 Tranmere. GOAL! Rangers 3-0 Aberdeen (Morelos 50) Alfredo Morelos, who was sent off umpteen times against Aberdeen last season, seals victory for Rangers. \u201cPalace started very brightly and gained momentum after the (clear) pen, but Norwich have had the better chances and were all over us towards the end of the half,\u201d says Matt P. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a couple more goals in this, Norwich forwards looking dangerous but Zaha electric as ever going forward.\u201d Thanks. I could get used to this. But seriously, it\u2019s very strange talking about matches you can\u2019t watch. Callum Wilson continues his storming form, drilling home from Josh King\u2019s pass. Chelsea finally take the lead. Mason Mount won the penalty and Jorginho scored it with his usual insouciance. \u201cRelieved that Wolves are ahead against Watford,\u201d says Pete Higginson. \u201cWe were beginning to panic here that a relegation struggle would ensue. But we\u2019ve got some tough away games next month, including Man City.\u201d You\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll finish in the top half again. GOAL! Paderborn 1-2 Bayern Munich (Proger 68) Full time: Juventus 2-0 SPAL An easy win for Juve, who move back to the top for the next few hours at least. Pjanic and Ronaldo were the scorers. Championship One other half-time score worth mentioning: Middlesbrough 1-4 Sheffield Wednesday. Ouch. Premier League Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley Bournemouth 1-1 West Ham Chelsea 0-0 Brighton Crystal Palace 1-0 Norwich Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Southampton Wolves 1-0 Watford Scottish Premiership Rangers 2-0 Aberdeen La Liga Getafe 0-1 Barcelona Bundesliga Paderborn 0-2 Bayern Munich (2.30pm) Serie A Juventus 2-0 SPAL (2pm) Championship Charlton 1-0 Leeds Swansea 1-0 Reading Preston 1-2 Bristol City League One Ipswich 1-1 Tranmere League Two Cheltenham Town 1-0 Crewe Alexandra You can see all the other latest scores here. \u201cAs much as I hate the knee-jerk \u2018club x in crisis\u2019 narrative, Spurs are playing like a club in crisis,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cWhat on earth are they playing at?\u201d Being fourth in the table, as things stand. I agree there is a strange mood around the place, but still, fourth in the table! European football A few big names have scored important goals. Cristiano Ronaldo has put Juventus 2-0 up at home to SPAL, Philippe Coutinho has done likewise for Bayern Munich at Paderborn, and Luis Suarez has put Barcelona ahead at Getafe. Harry Kane puts 10-man Spurs back in the lead, finishing emphatically from Christian Eriksen\u2019s pass. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cIn the Scottish Championship it\u2019s currently Lawrence Shankland 2-0 Morton at a sunny Tannadice. That\u2019s twelve goals in six and a half league games for the United striker. I\u2019ve not felt this good since Archie Gemmill scored for Scotland against Holland in 1978.\u201d Scottish Premiership Greg Stewart has put Rangers 2-0 up at home to Aberdeen. As things stand, they are a point behind Celtic. Oh dear lord. Hugo Lloris faffs over a backpass, then faffs a bit more, and Danny Ings helps himself to the cheapest goal he\u2019ll score for years. \u201cThe decline of Spurs makes me think of two things,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cOne, they\u2019re like the seemingly happy couple who break up after 16 years because they\u2019re just tired of one another. Two, Eriksen - and Pogba if rumours are true - wanting away to Madrid is doing it in an odd way. Both are playing like dead fish tossed onto the pitch. That makes them good buys? I\u2019m missing something here. At least when Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez wanted to go to Spain each gave absolutely everything to United and Liverpool respectively in their final seasons.\u201d Championship Another corner, another goal for Bristol City. Andreas Weimann has put them 2-0 up at Preston. Aston Villa 1-0 Burnley That Villa goal did count. Meanwhile, Luke Garbutt has made it Ipswich 1-0 Tranmere in League One. GOAL! Charlton 1-0 Leeds (Bonne 32) Leeds have battered Charlton - but now they\u2019re behind. VAR are checking this one as well. Serge Aurier has been sent off. Two yellow cards, so Spurs are down to ten men against Southampton. Championship Bristol City have taken a surprise lead at Preston, with Taylor Moore scoring from close range. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 0-0 Burnley Bournemouth 0-1 West Ham Chelsea 0-0 Brighton Crystal Palace 1-0 Norwich Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Southampton Wolves 1-0 Watford Scottish Premiership Rangers 1-0 Aberdeen La Liga Getafe 0-0 Barcelona Bundesliga Paderborn 0-1 Bayern Munich (2.30pm) Serie A Juventus 1-0 SPAL (2pm) Championship Charlton 0-0 Leeds Swansea 1-0 Reading Preston 0-1 Bristol City League One Ipswich 0-0 Tranmere League Two Cheltenham Town 1-0 Crewe Alexandra You can see all the other latest scores here. McGinn\u2019s goal has been disallowed by VAR. Don\u2019t ask me why, I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care. The promoted teams have been pretty impressive so far, in performances if not always results. Villa will hope to address that today, and the excellent John McGinn has given them the lead at home to Burnley. It\u2019s all happening. Son sets up Tanguy Ndombele to hammer Spurs into the lead against Southampton. As things stand, crisis club Spurs are fourth in the table. Scottish Premiership Rangers 1-0 Aberdeen (Tavernier 20 pen) Luka Milivojevic gives Palace the lead with an emphatic penalty. The award was, apparently, dubious in the extreme, but not enough for it to be overturned by VAR. Joshua King has equalised for Bournemouth! The goal was originally disallowed for offside, but the decision was overturned after a long VAR check. The folk on Sky Sports thought there was an offside in the build-up, but Mr VAR disagreed. Matt Doherty has given Wolves the lead with a fine goal.

League Two Gavin Reilly has given third-placed Cheltenham an early lead against second-placed Crewe. Andriy Yarmolenko scores a brilliant curler to give West Ham an early lead in the top-of-the-table clash at the Vitality Stadium. \u201cWhat are your thoughts re: Poch and the stalling Spurs?\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cIt just seems to me that he\u2019s on a par with Klopp and Pep in terms of managerial talent. Wouldn\u2019t wonder if he\u2019s grown tired of Levy and would be tempted to see what he could do with a chairman endlessly peeling off the Nelson Eddies over his shoulder.\u201d If I had a gun in my mouth and an order to predict where he\u2019ll be this time next year, I\u2019d say Manchester United, but nobody knows anything. There does seem to be a bit of inertia at the club, which is odd because this was supposed to be the season when everything came together. Championship Chris Martin has enlivened a quiet week for Derby by giving them an early lead at home to Birmingham. Peep peep! The 3pm matche are under way. While you wait for some goals to be scored, why not read this cracking interview with Joshua King. Cedric has been injured in the warm-up at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, so Jannik Vestergaard comes into the Southampton side. Brazen pluggery department \u201cVery excited to see Sarr and Welbeck in the Watford starting lineup,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cI\u2019m predicting a crushing 4-0 Hornet victory, because you can\u2019t jinx a team that\u2019s bottom of the league, with a goal difference nine worse than anyone else, can you? Can you? Can you?\u201d Goals goals goals! Paderborn 0-1 Bayern Munich (Gnabry 15) Juventus 1-0 SPAL (Pjanic 45) Here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s report from a fascinating match at Bramall Lane. It\u2019s still 0-0 at whatever Juventus are calling their home ground these days. Etrit Berisha has just made a lovely save from Paulo Dybala. It has finished Hibernian 1-1 Celtic at Easter Road. That gives Rangers the chance to move within a point of Celtic by beating Aberdeen the day. West Brom have gone top of the Championship with a 2-0 win at QPR. The teenager Nathan Ferguson scored the opening goal, the first of his career, and he is emotionally naked in his post-match interview. It means the world to me, it really does. I\u2019ve been at this club for a while and I\u2019ve been dreaming of this moment for years ... They gave me space! They gave me space so I thought, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m gonna drive into it.\u2019 Mum and Dad always tell me to shoot, so I decided to shoot this time, and it paid off. The kid cannot stop smiling, it\u2019s lovely. Full time: Sheffield United 0-1 Liverpool It\u2019s all over at Bramall Lane. Liverpool have made it seven wins out of seven, which moves them eight points clear for the next few hours at least. It was their least convincing win of the season, against a superb Sheffield United, but they\u2019ll not care.

Lauren James scored a lovely first goal before Katie Zelem sealed the win against her old club with an injury-time penalty. Liverpool have taken the lead at Bramall Lane with 20 minutes remaining, thanks to a grim error from the goalkeeper Dean Henderson. It\u2019s really harsh on Sheffield United, who have played superbly and almost took the lead a few minutes earlier. Some pre-match reading Aaron Ramsey starts for Juventus at home to SPAL. That fixture is 2nd v 19th, and later we\u2019ll see 20th v 1st: Sampdoria are hosting the leaders Internazionale. Scott Murray is following the early game at Bramall Lane. You won\u2019t believe the score! Hello. You know the drill: Saturday, 3pm and a sensory overload of association football.

About 200 people attended the funeral service while family members witnessed the burial in a courtyard.

Yet Wolves played with confidence and set about Watford with a clear strategy of catching an open defence on the turn. It was a strategy that created early half-chances and bore real fruit in the 19th minute.</p> <p>The move that led to the opening goal came down the left, wing-back Jonny providing the spark with a quick first-time pass inside Janmaat. Pedro Neto \u2013 making his first Wolves start \u2013 read the pass and cut the ball back beyond the obvious target of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez to the back post, where Doherty tucked home from six yards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8db01392d46b761a997fcad5b9aa9e98a891d1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8db01392d46b761a997fcad5b9aa9e98a891d1f1/0_0_5412_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adama Traor\u00e9 looks to go past Etienne Capoue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adama Traor\u00e9 looks to go past Etienne Capoue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wolves retreated into their shell after that and Watford began to dominate the ball, but the results were as their manager observed. In particular the forward line of Gerard Deloufeu, Danny Welbeck and Isma\u00efla Sarr, who had never played together before, looked like the strangers they are. Deulofeu was intent on driving down blind alleys, Welbeck was bested by Willy Boly while the main contribution from record signing Sarr was a shot scooped horribly over from 18 yards.</p> <p>Deloufeu was hauled off at half-time, not for ignoring his instructions, his manager said, but because of a \u201cbad day\u201d. His replacement Roberto Pereyra briefly looked like changing matters, sending Doherty spinning before crossing on to the head of Jos\u00e9 Holebas for Watford\u2019s best chance in the 53rd minute. Rui Patr\u00edcio made the save, however, and also denied Tom Cleverley on the follow up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight minutes later and the game was up.

Yet Wolves played with confidence and set about Watford with a clear strategy of catching an open defence on the turn. It was a strategy that created early half-chances and bore real fruit in the 19th minute. The move that led to the opening goal came down the left, wing-back Jonny providing the spark with a quick first-time pass inside Janmaat. Pedro Neto \u2013 making his first Wolves start \u2013 read the pass and cut the ball back beyond the obvious target of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez to the back post, where Doherty tucked home from six yards. Wolves retreated into their shell after that and Watford began to dominate the ball, but the results were as their manager observed. In particular the forward line of Gerard Deloufeu, Danny Welbeck and Isma\u00efla Sarr, who had never played together before, looked like the strangers they are. Deulofeu was intent on driving down blind alleys, Welbeck was bested by Willy Boly while the main contribution from record signing Sarr was a shot scooped horribly over from 18 yards. Deloufeu was hauled off at half-time, not for ignoring his instructions, his manager said, but because of a \u201cbad day\u201d. His replacement Roberto Pereyra briefly looked like changing matters, sending Doherty spinning before crossing on to the head of Jos\u00e9 Holebas for Watford\u2019s best chance in the 53rd minute. Rui Patr\u00edcio made the save, however, and also denied Tom Cleverley on the follow up. Eight minutes later and the game was up. Adama Traor\u00e9 played the key ball this time, an unlikely but excellent pass through a corridor of Watford players to set Doherty free once again. His cross was not the best but after substitute Morgan Gibbs-White \u2013 on for Neto \u2013 was able to get a flicked head on to it, the ball flew against Janmaat and into his own net.",

The crowd remained patient even when Chelsea were struggling to break Brighton down and it turned into a carnival atmosphere once Frank Lampard\u2019s side, gifted a lead by a catastrophic error from Adam Webster, pulled clear of limited opponents in the second half.</p> <p>Such is the effect of having Lampard in the dugout during these transitional times for Chelsea, whose supporters were not quite as understanding when it was Maurizio Sarri standing there last season. Even Jorginho\u2019s name is bellowed from the stands these days, signalling how the mood has changed. A divisive figure under Sarri, the Italy midfielder has emerged as a leader at the start of his second year in English football and it was his penalty that eased Chelsea towards their first home win in the league under Lampard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/tottenham-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Harry Kane rescues Hugo Lloris as 10-man Tottenham beat Southampton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was an afternoon when Chelsea\u2019s senior players outshone the youngsters. Lampard praised Jorginho\u2019s coolness under pressure and the points were made safe by Willian\u2019s first goal of the season, though Brighton\u2019s toothlessness should not be overlooked when it comes to analysing how Chelsea managed to keep a clean sheet for the first time since May. Graham Potter\u2019s side, winless since the opening day and a point above the bottom three, mustered one shot on target.</p> <p>Not that it was entirely straightforward from Chelsea\u2019s perspective. They were tense before Jorginho, who had an excellent game pulling the strings in midfield, broke the deadlock in the 50th minute and Lampard admitted to feeling some anxiety after seeing Tammy Abraham, Marcos Alonso, Ross Barkley and Pedro spurn fine opportunities in the first half.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c481466ecd23e681bf4786da38dc596b69bdf860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c481466ecd23e681bf4786da38dc596b69bdf860/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Marcos Alonso runs with the ball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea\u2019s Marcos Alonso runs with the ball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou could have almost felt the frustration at half-time,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cNow it gives not just the players but the fans confidence. My message to the players was not to get despondent, not to feel flat, not to get sloppy. It was to keep playing at pace. Because of not winning here, you fear the worst. But there was a different feel today. When the ball moved quickly it looked good.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea were on top from the start, dominating territory and the ball, but they fell flat after Abraham nodded Mason Mount\u2019s free-kick against the post in the 15th minute.

      "bodyText": "Stamford Bridge is in danger of becoming the happiest ground in the country. The crowd remained patient even when Chelsea were struggling to break Brighton down and it turned into a carnival atmosphere once Frank Lampard\u2019s side, gifted a lead by a catastrophic error from Adam Webster, pulled clear of limited opponents in the second half. Such is the effect of having Lampard in the dugout during these transitional times for Chelsea, whose supporters were not quite as understanding when it was Maurizio Sarri standing there last season. Even Jorginho\u2019s name is bellowed from the stands these days, signalling how the mood has changed. A divisive figure under Sarri, the Italy midfielder has emerged as a leader at the start of his second year in English football and it was his penalty that eased Chelsea towards their first home win in the league under Lampard. It was an afternoon when Chelsea\u2019s senior players outshone the youngsters. Lampard praised Jorginho\u2019s coolness under pressure and the points were made safe by Willian\u2019s first goal of the season, though Brighton\u2019s toothlessness should not be overlooked when it comes to analysing how Chelsea managed to keep a clean sheet for the first time since May. Graham Potter\u2019s side, winless since the opening day and a point above the bottom three, mustered one shot on target. Not that it was entirely straightforward from Chelsea\u2019s perspective. They were tense before Jorginho, who had an excellent game pulling the strings in midfield, broke the deadlock in the 50th minute and Lampard admitted to feeling some anxiety after seeing Tammy Abraham, Marcos Alonso, Ross Barkley and Pedro spurn fine opportunities in the first half. \u201cYou could have almost felt the frustration at half-time,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cNow it gives not just the players but the fans confidence. My message to the players was not to get despondent, not to feel flat, not to get sloppy. It was to keep playing at pace. Because of not winning here, you fear the worst. But there was a different feel today. When the ball moved quickly it looked good.\u201d Chelsea were on top from the start, dominating territory and the ball, but they fell flat after Abraham nodded Mason Mount\u2019s free-kick against the post in the 15th minute. Barkley, handed a rare start in the absence of the hamstrung N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, twice endangered his side by losing the ball in dangerous positions and there were howls of frustration when Alonso volleyed over from close range. It was just as well that Brighton were in a giving mood. They played out from the back throughout and paid for their bravery when Webster suffered a brain-freeze shortly after the restart, dithering on the ball in his own area, losing it to Mount and tripping the Chelsea midfielder in an attempt to salvage the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s not the player\u2019s responsibility, it\u2019s mine,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWe ask them to play that way.\u201d Webster was booked and, after all the nonsense before Barkley\u2019s miss in the recent defeat by Valencia, there were no arguments about who should take the penalty. Barkley and Willian both stepped aside, allowing Jorginho to clip a firm shot past Mat Ryan. Brighton managed a brief flurry, going close when Steven Alzate\u2019s deflected shot trickled inches wide and Dan Burn headed against the bar from a corner, but Chelsea regained control after replacing Barkley with Mateo Kovacic. Callum Hudson-Odoi also came on for his first league appearance of the season and Chelsea, who could have Kant\u00e9 available when they face Lille in the Champions League on Wednesday, sealed a deserved victory when Willian\u2019s deflected shot beat Ryan in the 76th minute.",

      "body": "<p>Roblox may not be as famous a children\u2019s game as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/07/fortnite-battle-royale-parents-guide-video-game-multiplayer-shooter\" title=\"\"><em>Fortnite</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/may/18/minecraft-at-10-building-things-and-changing-lives\" title=\"\"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, but it recently announced that it has more than 100 million active monthly players.</p> <p>It has flown more under the media radar than those rivals, leaving parents whose children are now asking to play it (or playing it without asking) in need of a primer.</p> <h2><strong>What is Roblox?</strong> </h2> <p>It\u2019s not a single game, but rather a collection of more than 50m games, all created by its community of players. The simplest comparison is to YouTube: a huge library of \u201cuser-generated content\u201d, but in this case the content is games rather than videos.</p> <p>Children (and adults) download the Roblox application for computers, games consoles, smartphones or tablets and use it to browse and play its catalogue of games. Social features are also key to its appeal, including the ability to add friends and chat to them while playing.</p> <p>Roblox isn\u2019t a new thing: it officially launched in 2006, and has been growing steadily ever since.</p> <h2><strong>How many children play it?</strong> </h2> <p>Roblox doesn\u2019t split its 100 million figure between children and adults, though it does say that 40% of them are women and girls.</p> <p>In the UK alone, there are around 1.5 million children playing Roblox, according to research firm Kids Insights. Its data, based on an annual survey of 20,000 British children, suggests that 24% of 10- to 12-year-olds here are on Roblox \u2013 more than on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" title=\"\">TikTok </a>(13%) and <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\" title=\"\">Snapchat</a> (20%) and nearly as popular as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> (25%).</p> <p>The company adds that 19% of seven-to-nine-year-olds in the UK are playing Roblox, some way behind YouTube (43%) but ahead of TV brands like CBBC (11%), Nickelodeon (10%) and Cartoon Network (8%).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d8fb562ec9971564a4378f4534a81f2aec61bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d8fb562ec9971564a4378f4534a81f2aec61bc/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Work at a Pizza Place by Dued1 \u2013 teams of players fill orders and earn credits to buy home furnishings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Work at a Pizza Place by Dued1 \u2013 teams of players fill orders and earn credits to buy home furnishings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roblox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Why is Roblox popular?</strong> </h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a company that does a lot of marketing. The No 1 way that someone finds out about our platform is they get invited to play by a friend. And the second way is they\u2019ll watch people playing on YouTube,\u201d says Roblox\u2019s chief business officer Craig Donato. \u201cSo it\u2019s very much an organic phenomenon.\u201d</p> <p>He also suggests that one reason for Roblox\u2019s popularity is its emphasis on \u201cunstructured play\u201d in an era when many children are more restricted in their physical-world activities than previous generations were.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came home from school, I\u2019d get on my bike, go out in the woods, do pick-up baseball. But we live in a world today where it\u2019s hard for kids to go out and have unstructured play with their friends,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the experiences on our platform aren\u2019t just about the object to win. It\u2019s an experience you have with other people: a shared experience.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How do people make games for it?</strong> </h2> <p>Anyone can make a game (or \u201cexperience\u201d \u2013 they can simply be virtual spaces) for Roblox by downloading its separate <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/create\" title=\"\">Roblox Studio software</a>. The company says that it has more than 2 million \u201ccreators\u201d \u2013 so around 2% of its players \u2013 with the most popular games being played by up to 100,000 people simultaneously.</p> <p>For many children, creating a simple game or virtual room where they can hang out with friends is the limit of their ambitions, but others build bigger, more complex games, and even start to make money through taking a cut of in-game purchases using Roblox\u2019s virtual currency, Robux. The company expects to pay out more than $100m in 2019 alone to them.</p> <p>\u201cWe have these teams forming businesses, and making millions of dollars a year,\u201d says Donato. Roblox is keen to foster this community: in 2018 it launched its own curriculum, available under a Creative Commons licence, for educators to use. Donato says it reached more than 500,000 children in its first year.</p> <h2><strong>Are people really making businesses out of this?</strong> </h2> <p>They are. Josh Wood is one of the British Roblox game-makers. He\u2019s 18 now, but discovered Roblox in 2013, and started to make his own games for it a year later.</p> <p>\u201cFrom there I continued to learn and collaborate with other people on projects until I released my most successful game to date, <em>Game Dev Life</em>, which has so far had over a million play sessions,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Wood has now set up his own company to make games for Roblox, hiring other developers, artists and testers, and even launching a line of toys based on <em>Game Dev Life</em>, in partnership with Roblox.</p> <p>\u201cWith the money from my games I have been able to pay for my university education, and continue to reinvest in my business,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Another young British developer working on Roblox games is Abbie Leigh. Now aged 19, she started playing Roblox in 2011, but took the leap into development in 2017, initially creating assets for other people\u2019s games. She\u2019s currently working on three games, including her own sports-themed title, and hopes to make a full-time career out of freelance development.</p> <p>\u201cIt never feels like a job, which of course is the best part. I enjoy building and do so in my free time, and I\u2019m simply rewarded when it comes to doing what I love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6aa4df88cddc87b43c041e60e62fc6cc62f6383d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aa4df88cddc87b43c041e60e62fc6cc62f6383d/0_0_2560_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Game Dev Life by DoubleJGames.

Players must try to build a successful game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roblox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Is Roblox safe for children?</strong> </h2> <p>When Roblox has made headlines in the mainstream media, they have often been negative: from reports of adults trying to groom children on the platform in 2017 to, most infamously, a virtual sexual assault in June 2018, when a seven-year old player\u2019s avatar was attacked by two male avatars, whose players had hacked the game\u2019s code to show explicit imagery.</p> <p>The following month, the <em>Sun</em> published an investigation claiming that Roblox was \u201ca haven for roleplaying as jihadis, Nazi leaders and Ku Klux Klan members\u201d. The company says that it has been working hard to tackle wrongdoers and fix any loopholes in its platform.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not defensive if things have ever gone wrong. We hold our hands up and say, \u2018This is what we\u2019ve done to fix it, and this is what we\u2019re doing to make sure it never happens again,\u2019\u201d says Laura Higgins, a British child-safety veteran hired by Roblox in January 2019 as its \u2018director of digital civility\u2019. Her job is to learn from those problems and prevent activities that could harm young players.</p> <p>\u201cWe really do start with safety as our No 1 priority. We acknowledge that we have younger players, so you have to be as ahead of the game as possible in terms of safety,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an age-old thing: if people have bad intentions towards children, they\u2019re going to gravitate towards where the children are. We\u2019re constantly reviewing the tools that we have, and looking at ways to improve them.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How can parents keep informed about it?</strong> </h2> <p>Another measure taken by Roblox is to launch a section of its website called <a href=\"https://corp.roblox.com/parents/\" title=\"\">For Parents</a>, which explains its safety tools \u2013 from algorithms blocking swearwords and names and addresses in text chats, to its reporting system for inappropriate chat or content. There\u2019s even an algorithm detecting whether players\u2019 avatars are wearing \u201cappropriate attire\u201d.</p> <p>Higgins admits that parents can get \u201cvery frustrated\u201d when there\u2019s a horror story around safety on a children\u2019s platform like Roblox: \u201cYou think, how hard can it be? [to stop these things happening],\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very hard, is the answer. When things go wrong, it\u2019s because somebody is trying very hard to break your systems.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s keen to make sure that parents also see the positive side of the games that children are creating on Roblox, citing the example of a game made by a teenager whose father had recently died.</p> <p>\u201cHe developed a game around managing mental wellbeing, mental health, as a journey for other young people experiencing those kinds of issues,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an amazing outlet for him, but it also helped many young people who played it, and were able to explore their emotions.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s an aspect also highlighted by developer Abbie Leigh. \u201cI absolutely love the developer community as a whole. We all stick together, support each other\u2019s creations and help each other when we need it the most,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom feedback on games, to personal issues.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Roblox may not be as famous a children\u2019s game as Fortnite or Minecraft, but it recently announced that it has more than 100 million active monthly players. It has flown more under the media radar than those rivals, leaving parents whose children are now asking to play it (or playing it without asking) in need of a primer. What is Roblox? It\u2019s not a single game, but rather a collection of more than 50m games, all created by its community of players. The simplest comparison is to YouTube: a huge library of \u201cuser-generated content\u201d, but in this case the content is games rather than videos. Children (and adults) download the Roblox application for computers, games consoles, smartphones or tablets and use it to browse and play its catalogue of games. Social features are also key to its appeal, including the ability to add friends and chat to them while playing. Roblox isn\u2019t a new thing: it officially launched in 2006, and has been growing steadily ever since. How many children play it? Roblox doesn\u2019t split its 100 million figure between children and adults, though it does say that 40% of them are women and girls. In the UK alone, there are around 1.5 million children playing Roblox, according to research firm Kids Insights. Its data, based on an annual survey of 20,000 British children, suggests that 24% of 10- to 12-year-olds here are on Roblox \u2013 more than on TikTok (13%) and Snapchat (20%) and nearly as popular as Instagram (25%). The company adds that 19% of seven-to-nine-year-olds in the UK are playing Roblox, some way behind YouTube (43%) but ahead of TV brands like CBBC (11%), Nickelodeon (10%) and Cartoon Network (8%). Why is Roblox popular? \u201cWe\u2019re not a company that does a lot of marketing. The No 1 way that someone finds out about our platform is they get invited to play by a friend. And the second way is they\u2019ll watch people playing on YouTube,\u201d says Roblox\u2019s chief business officer Craig Donato. \u201cSo it\u2019s very much an organic phenomenon.\u201d He also suggests that one reason for Roblox\u2019s popularity is its emphasis on \u201cunstructured play\u201d in an era when many children are more restricted in their physical-world activities than previous generations were. \u201cWhen I came home from school, I\u2019d get on my bike, go out in the woods, do pick-up baseball. But we live in a world today where it\u2019s hard for kids to go out and have unstructured play with their friends,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the experiences on our platform aren\u2019t just about the object to win. It\u2019s an experience you have with other people: a shared experience.\u201d How do people make games for it? Anyone can make a game (or \u201cexperience\u201d \u2013 they can simply be virtual spaces) for Roblox by downloading its separate Roblox Studio software. The company says that it has more than 2 million \u201ccreators\u201d \u2013 so around 2% of its players \u2013 with the most popular games being played by up to 100,000 people simultaneously. For many children, creating a simple game or virtual room where they can hang out with friends is the limit of their ambitions, but others build bigger, more complex games, and even start to make money through taking a cut of in-game purchases using Roblox\u2019s virtual currency, Robux. The company expects to pay out more than $100m in 2019 alone to them. \u201cWe have these teams forming businesses, and making millions of dollars a year,\u201d says Donato. Roblox is keen to foster this community: in 2018 it launched its own curriculum, available under a Creative Commons licence, for educators to use. Donato says it reached more than 500,000 children in its first year. Are people really making businesses out of this? They are. Josh Wood is one of the British Roblox game-makers. He\u2019s 18 now, but discovered Roblox in 2013, and started to make his own games for it a year later. \u201cFrom there I continued to learn and collaborate with other people on projects until I released my most successful game to date, Game Dev Life, which has so far had over a million play sessions,\u201d he says. Wood has now set up his own company to make games for Roblox, hiring other developers, artists and testers, and even launching a line of toys based on Game Dev Life, in partnership with Roblox. \u201cWith the money from my games I have been able to pay for my university education, and continue to reinvest in my business,\u201d he says. Another young British developer working on Roblox games is Abbie Leigh. Now aged 19, she started playing Roblox in 2011, but took the leap into development in 2017, initially creating assets for other people\u2019s games. She\u2019s currently working on three games, including her own sports-themed title, and hopes to make a full-time career out of freelance development. \u201cIt never feels like a job, which of course is the best part. I enjoy building and do so in my free time, and I\u2019m simply rewarded when it comes to doing what I love.\u201d Is Roblox safe for children? When Roblox has made headlines in the mainstream media, they have often been negative: from reports of adults trying to groom children on the platform in 2017 to, most infamously, a virtual sexual assault in June 2018, when a seven-year old player\u2019s avatar was attacked by two male avatars, whose players had hacked the game\u2019s code to show explicit imagery. The following month, the Sun published an investigation claiming that Roblox was \u201ca haven for roleplaying as jihadis, Nazi leaders and Ku Klux Klan members\u201d. The company says that it has been working hard to tackle wrongdoers and fix any loopholes in its platform. \u201cWe\u2019re not defensive if things have ever gone wrong. We hold our hands up and say, \u2018This is what we\u2019ve done to fix it, and this is what we\u2019re doing to make sure it never happens again,\u2019\u201d says Laura Higgins, a British child-safety veteran hired by Roblox in January 2019 as its \u2018director of digital civility\u2019. Her job is to learn from those problems and prevent activities that could harm young players. \u201cWe really do start with safety as our No 1 priority. We acknowledge that we have younger players, so you have to be as ahead of the game as possible in terms of safety,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an age-old thing: if people have bad intentions towards children, they\u2019re going to gravitate towards where the children are. We\u2019re constantly reviewing the tools that we have, and looking at ways to improve them.\u201d How can parents keep informed about it? Another measure taken by Roblox is to launch a section of its website called For Parents, which explains its safety tools \u2013 from algorithms blocking swearwords and names and addresses in text chats, to its reporting system for inappropriate chat or content. There\u2019s even an algorithm detecting whether players\u2019 avatars are wearing \u201cappropriate attire\u201d. Higgins admits that parents can get \u201cvery frustrated\u201d when there\u2019s a horror story around safety on a children\u2019s platform like Roblox: \u201cYou think, how hard can it be? [to stop these things happening],\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very hard, is the answer. When things go wrong, it\u2019s because somebody is trying very hard to break your systems.\u201d She\u2019s keen to make sure that parents also see the positive side of the games that children are creating on Roblox, citing the example of a game made by a teenager whose father had recently died. \u201cHe developed a game around managing mental wellbeing, mental health, as a journey for other young people experiencing those kinds of issues,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an amazing outlet for him, but it also helped many young people who played it, and were able to explore their emotions.\u201d That\u2019s an aspect also highlighted by developer Abbie Leigh. \u201cI absolutely love the developer community as a whole. We all stick together, support each other\u2019s creations and help each other when we need it the most,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom feedback on games, to personal issues.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Staff from Thomas Cook are to hold protests at this week\u2019s Tory party conference in Manchester and later at Downing Street over the government\u2019s decision not to step in and save the company from liquidation.</p> <p>Staff were due to get their monthly salaries on 30 September but are instead among Thomas Cook\u2019s creditors, and it is now unclear when they will be paid. Some 150,000 UK holidaymakers are being repatriated at taxpayers\u2019 expense following the demise of the world\u2019s oldest tour operator. On 28 September, a further 16,700 customers were set to be flown home.</p> <p>Hundreds of employees of Thomas Cook Airlines are expected to gather at the conference on 30 September to express their anger. \u201cThey won\u2019t be overly political but they feel abandoned by the government,\u201d said a spokesman for the Unite union.</p> <p>A group of workers will then travel to London to protest outside 10 Downing Street on 2 October. Among them is former cabin attendant Emma Boxen, who learned of the collapse via social media. She is owed over \u00a32,000 in pay but says she has not received any official communication from the company. \u201cI can\u2019t afford my mortgage. I have all of my bills to pay. It is just horrible,\u201d she said. Online funding pages are being set up to help former employees with the cost of travel to London, she added.</p> <p>The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been accused of acting far too late after she set up a taskforce to help those affected. The parliamentary business, energy and industrial strategy committee has announced an inquiry into the role of \u201ccorporate greed\u201d in the collapse, focusing on directors\u2019 stewardship of the firm, their pay, and the role of auditors.</p> <p>The collapse of Thomas Cook is likely to wreak havoc on tourist industries around the world, and nowhere more so than Greece, where locals considered the company too big to fail.

      "bodyText": "Staff from Thomas Cook are to hold protests at this week\u2019s Tory party conference in Manchester and later at Downing Street over the government\u2019s decision not to step in and save the company from liquidation. Staff were due to get their monthly salaries on 30 September but are instead among Thomas Cook\u2019s creditors, and it is now unclear when they will be paid. Some 150,000 UK holidaymakers are being repatriated at taxpayers\u2019 expense following the demise of the world\u2019s oldest tour operator. On 28 September, a further 16,700 customers were set to be flown home. Hundreds of employees of Thomas Cook Airlines are expected to gather at the conference on 30 September to express their anger. \u201cThey won\u2019t be overly political but they feel abandoned by the government,\u201d said a spokesman for the Unite union. A group of workers will then travel to London to protest outside 10 Downing Street on 2 October. Among them is former cabin attendant Emma Boxen, who learned of the collapse via social media. She is owed over \u00a32,000 in pay but says she has not received any official communication from the company. \u201cI can\u2019t afford my mortgage. I have all of my bills to pay. It is just horrible,\u201d she said. Online funding pages are being set up to help former employees with the cost of travel to London, she added. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been accused of acting far too late after she set up a taskforce to help those affected. The parliamentary business, energy and industrial strategy committee has announced an inquiry into the role of \u201ccorporate greed\u201d in the collapse, focusing on directors\u2019 stewardship of the firm, their pay, and the role of auditors. The collapse of Thomas Cook is likely to wreak havoc on tourist industries around the world, and nowhere more so than Greece, where locals considered the company too big to fail. Manolis Giannoulis, head of the hoteliers\u2019 association in Chania, Crete, said: \u201cIt was the second-largest tour operator in Europe. Falling like this proves that anything can happen.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our correspondent\u2019s testimony from the finish line. An absolutely staggering, ultimately 105km effort from the Dutch victor. Tomorrow: the men take to the roads, but it\u2019s going to take some doing to better that. Time to wrap up here \u2013 thanks for joining us! Annemiek van Vleuten, speaking to the BBC, said: \u201cIt was a crazy plan. It was actually not planned. I wanted to go hard on the climb. It was crazy. I train a lot and that helped me. So many emotions. My mother is here, that means a lot to me. It was such a big dream to me. I really enjoyed all the people here today. Such a different taste to the time-trial. \u201cI thought was my big opportunity. It was really hard to come back from injury \u2013 a really hard period. Now I have time to enjoy it. [It will be a] super-good podium!\u201d Chris Boardman added of her performance: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It was fantastic, and a very brave effort to go from that far out. She deserved it.\u201d An extremely emotional Lizzie Deignan reflected on her own efforts: \u201cI\u2019m super-happy, physically, with my performance but tactically it was a masterclass in how to get it wrong. I probably should have readjusted earlier. I was going for the rainbow. I went for the gold \u2026 Annemiek was in a class of her own.\u201d Marianne Vos kicks clear of the peloton in a crowd-pleasing final sprint. Lizzie Deignan ultimately crossed as part of the bunch in 31st place, at 5:31 off the front. Van der Breggen crosses in second, 2:15 back. And despite Spratt \u2013 who finished runner-up last year \u2013 digging in at the finish, she just couldn\u2019t get back to the champion. Dygert\u2019s valiant chasing effort was ultimately in vain, as she finishes fourth, 3:24 behind the leader. She is absolutely spent. They all are, to be fair. Incredible. Twice world time-trial champion, and now the road race victor. By a distance, too. That was a ONE HUNDRED KILOMETRE breakaway. Bloody hell. 1km to go. It\u2019s Van Vleuten, Van der Breggen, Spratt, in that order. But the places on the podium won\u2019t reflect the dominance of the victor. 2.5km to go. Van Vleuten is smiling for the cameras and gesturing for the crowds to roar her in. She knows she has it in the bag. Things haven\u2019t gone completely as planned for Dutch riders this week, particularly in the women\u2019s time trial, but this is a performance to treasure. 4.9km to go. In the blink of an eye, the champion dug in and pulled five metres out of her Australian rival. The favourite for the race suddenly has clear road between second and third places. Despite these efforts, Van Vleuten is STILL extending her lead \u2013 now 2:14. If anyone will take your money betting against it, a Dutch one-two looks assured. 6km to go. And no mistake, the race for gold in this race is all about Van Vleuten. With breakaways, it\u2019s incredibly easy to ignore the rider out front and concentrate on the efforts of those hammering it out for the minor places. This has been an almost 100km solo effort from last year\u2019s time-trial winner. It\u2019s been an absolutely phenomenal performance. 9km to go. Spratt has a go. With Van der Breggen having taken most of the initiative in chasing down Dygert, the Australian rider tests the champion. Van Vleuten\u2019s lead is 2:19 and, with so little road ahead, at this stage she could get off for a quick walk around and still have time in hand. No response from Dygert, and she\u2019s stuck fast in fourth at this stage. 12.7km to go. Dygert is caught. She tries desperately to hang on to the pair passing her, but the rhythm and the momentum is clearly with Van der Breggen and Spratt and her hopes of a second medal, following her time-trial heroics earlier in the week, look done. Deignan crosses in sixth with a lap to go, and after a long time riding on her own, the peloton has her. There\u2019ll be no medal for the Brit this year. 14km to go. Van Vleuten takes the bell, and she\u2019s being roared through by the fans roadside. Dygert is rocking slightly, and is being reeled in by Van der Breggen and Spratt. As she takes the bell, the gap is nine seconds to the riders in third and fourth. Longo Borghini, blowing hard, is 30 seconds behind in fifth. 15km to go. Van der Breggen, last year\u2019s winner, looks like she\u2019s not just trying to fight for the bronze medal. The gold looks like it\u2019s gone, but both she and Spratt smell silver. Van Vleuten is 2:15 clear out front. At this stage if she stays on her bike, she wins. 18km to go. Suddenly it looks like four riders fighting for three podium places. Longo Borghini can\u2019t respond to a push from Van der Breggen, and now the Dutch rider only has Spratt for company. The gap to Dygert is 20 seconds. Varvara Fasoi, the sole rider from Greece in the lineup, has dropped out. 20km to go. Van der Breggen, Spratt and Longo Borghini smell blood. The trio currently fighting it out for third place may soon be duking it out for silver, as they hit a long straight stretch of road where they can count the gap out for themselves. Dygert isn\u2019t done, however, and has pulled a few more seconds out. 21km to go. Suddenly, the chase is flagging. With 23.7km to go, Dygert showed signs of flagging somewhat in second place. After a hell of an effort, the gap is 20 seconds ahead of the chase trio, but falling back from Van Vleuten. Signs of grimacing and after looking like having silver in her grasp, she may soon face a challenge to get a medal at all. Van Vleuten\u2019s putting in one hell of a solo effort up front and still looks so strong. She has a lead of precisely 2:00. 25km to go. Dygert is not messing about with her racing line \u2013 some of her cornering is alarmingly close to the barriers. As she reaches the two-laps-to-go mark, the gap from second to first is 1:49. At this rate it will take a huge dip from Van Vleuten to help her cause, but the American is clearly the rider of interest as far as the destiny of the medals is concerned. She has a 28-second cushion from the chasers. Deignan\u2019s podium hopes may be done \u2013 she is exactly three minutes back from Van Vleuten as she crosses the line with two circuits remaining. The peloton is 4:38 back from the lead. 29km to go: Van Vleuten\u2019s lead has just dipped back under two minutes. And it\u2019s falling all the time. This is an incredible effort from Dygert. At 28km, it\u2019s down to 1:54. There\u2019s two laps to go. 30km to go. Dygert is now 17 seconds clear of the chase group. Van der Breggen is working hard on the Oak Beck climb to close in with Spratt and Longo Borghini in tow, but the American\u2019s move looks decisive. Dygert looks set to pull the gap to leader Van Vleuten back under two minutes. Home hope Deignan isn\u2019t done entirely and looks to be closing back in on the chasers, but it will take some ride for her to get a medal here. 35km to go. Deignan has fallen off the back of the chase group. Dygert\u2019s push has hurt those riders around her, and the gap is now 2:12. Van der Breggen still looks unbelievably fresh. A replay of Dygert\u2019s initial attack shows how she caught the chasers by surprise \u2013 she swung to the right of the road, dug into the pedals to storm past half a dozen riders, and had a 10-metre cushion before anyone seemed to notice. 40km to go. Afternoon all, Stuart here and enormous thanks to Tom for an epic stint across road and rugby madness today. The gap from leader Van Vleuten briefly reached the 2:45 mark, but Dygert is having another go at the front of the chase group, and that time is coming down. Some untidiness handing over to riders in the feed zone resulted in at least one briefly being unseated, but thankfully nothing too serious. 45km to go. Van Vleuten, a time trial specialist, now has 2min 10secs on the chasing group so talk on TV turns to solo victories. The Dutch leader is nearing the start of the circuit so the group behind will have to put in a concerted effort to catch her, which all suits Van der Breggen who has done no work. That it for me on the blog, I am handing you over to my colleague Stuart Goodwin to see over the line. 50km to go. Deignan is forcing the pace at the front of the group but Van Vleuten remains well ahead, some 1min 35secs. Further back the Dutch have posted a rider on the front of the main bunch, perhaps an effort to bring this back together. 55km to go. Deignan makes a burst off the front of the chase group to test the legs of those around her. The group remains together but the Briton will have a better idea of who can go with her should she try a more sustained breakaway. 63km to go. Ven Vleuten has stretched her lead out to 1min 20secs as we go over a lumpy section before the Harrogate circuits. 71km to go. An update on the chasing group, Deignan is alongside Van der Breggen (NED), Elisa Longo Borghini, Soraya Paladin (ITA), Clara Koppenburg (GER), Amanda Spratt (AUS), Chloe Dygert (USA) and Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (DEN). 73km to go. The time gaps are fluctuating but Van Vleuten is holding strong at the front. She will be concerned that she has been unable to stretch the gap further. On the side of the roads the Yorkshire crowds are deep and loud, they have also been blessed with sunshine in late September too. 80km to go. The peloton is going backwards, the chase riders have about 3mins on the bunch behind, Van Vleuten is holding her gap. 87km to go. The gap to Van Vleuten is coming down a bit, back below 50 seconds. Behind Deignan and co., the likes of Marianne Vos and Chantal Blaak are losing time in the main peloton. The gap is about 1min 20 secs between the peloton and the chasers, meaning that currently only Dutch riders are in any position to win. Currently the Netherlands are wasting the majority of their deep squad. 97km to go. Alongside Deignan in the chasing group we have Van der Breggen (NED), Elisa Longo Borghini, Soraya Paladin (ITA), Clara Koppenburg (GER), Amanda Spratt (AUS), Chloe Dygert, Tayler Wiles , Ruth Winder (USA), Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (DEN) and Ashleigh Pasio-Moolman (RSA). 101km to go. Van Vleuten is haring down the hill, she has 1min 10secs on the chasers. 103km to go. Van Vleuten has got out to about a 55 seconds on the chasers, there is not a lot of the climb left. Deignan has a little dart and takes a few riders with her, whittling down the group further. 104km to go. Annemiek van Vleuten is putting the pedal down and Deignan initially started to go with her before opting to ride within herself. The two-time time trial world champion is pulling away but there is an elite group behind her, featuring Deignan and Anna van der Breggen. 109km to go. Just a few more kilomtres before we hit Lofthouse. There is a bit of jostling from the major teams to ensure they are well positioned for the climb. Lizzie Deignan\u2019s husband Philip has a neat preview of what\u2019s to come on the Harrogate circuit: 119km to go. The British team are together at the front of the peloton as they go through a more serene part of the course. We get the major climb in about 12 kilometres, that should liven things up a bit. 128km to go. Banks goes down again at the back of the peloton, again it is nothing serious but New Zealand\u2019s Ella Banks suffers a lengthier bike issue and loses about 30 seconds in a bike change. 129km to go. The Dutch are not holding back, sending Floortje Mackaij up the road now the peloton will have to chase briefly. With an eight woman squad to draw on, the Netherlands can throw a few different looks at the peloton. 130km to go. We already have a bit of a split in the peloton on Norwood Edge as the Dutch pace us up the hill. It is only a two kilometre climb but it is enough to do some damage and we have already whittled down the front group to around 40 riders. 135km to go. We have had about 14 kilometres since the flag dropped in Bradford and we will soon be heading up the course\u2019s two climbs, Norwood Edge and the Lofthouse. They are unlikely to be decisive, with the real action to unfold on circuits around Harrogate. Deignan is well set but there was a brief scare for teammate Lizzy Banks, with a little technical issue, but she got back on. The Cycling World Championships may be in Yorkshire but all roads for the women\u2019s title go through the Netherlands. Bad news for home fans and Lizzie Deignan with her hopes of regaining the crown she won in 2015 appearing slim. Not only is Deignan battling one of the deepest Dutch squads ever assembled but also a host of former Boels-Dolmans teammates. A collective palmar\u00e8s that includes five road and two time trial world titles, two road Olympic golds, 40 stage and four overall wins at the Giro Rosa as well as a long list of victories in the cycling calendar\u2019s one-day classics means it would be a shock to see no shades of orange stood on top of the podium come the end of the race. Defending champion Anna van der Breggen is backed up by Marianne Vos, with Annemiek van Vleuten, the 2017 world road champion Chantal Blaak and Amy Pieters also on the roster the best chance for any challenger might be for the Dutch to beat themselves. Deignan returned to the road in April after after giving birth to her daughter Orla last year and knows she only has an outside chance on her home turf. A win at the Women\u2019s Tour in June is her best result since coming back but if she were to take advantage of home comforts again that would represent another level entirely. \u201cTo win here would be elation rather than relief,\u201d she told the BBC ahead of the race, referencing her favourite status in 2015. Perhaps reduced pressure could be just the ticket.",

      "body": "<p>One Saturday this summer I stood in a field and held my breath as I waited for my nine-year-old daughter Sofya to jump through a ring of fire. Despite her enthusiasm, the hours of practice she\u2019d had with expert adults and the many fire marshals on duty, I could see she was in conflict: afraid of the flames and equally scared of not pushing herself through that fear into the unknown.</p> <p>As she watched her friends take their turns \u2013 tensing her body as they ran; wincing as they jumped; grinning and clapping when they were safely on the other side \u2013 I faced my own internal struggle. I was torn between scooping her up to a safe place away from all this heat and pressure, and standing back, trusting her and letting her take the risk. It felt like a rite of passage for us both.</p> <p>This mother/daughter moment of truth came as part of an annual family festival, <a href=\"https://www.starry-skies.net/\" title=\"\">Starry Skies</a>, whose mission is to let the kids \u201croam free\u201d. Little ones, like our five-year-old son, join the Woodland Tribe, using hammers and nails to build their own adventure playgrounds or slide down zip wires, and toast bread over a fire. Meanwhile kids my daughter\u2019s age join the Burrow, a twice-daily gathering in a shady forest that culminates in a courageous performance in front of parents. These sessions aim to create a sense of community for children in a place they feel they can belong. It\u2019s designed to build self-confidence by cultivating resilience and a belief that we can all be the change we want to see in the world. For Sofya it was simply her very own, secret, grown-up club where she felt instantly at home.</p> <p><em><strong>Our family\u2019s experiences</strong></em> at the festival over the past three years sit alongside our move to a more self-sufficient way of living on a smallholding. Both have played an important role in convincing me that having the opportunity to manage your own risk and test your boundaries (without parents breathing down your neck) is a vital part of childhood. But as someone whose natural tendency is to worry and helicopter-parent, knowing is one thing and following through another.</p> <p>I remember the first walk my husband and I took with our 10-day-old daughter, limping slowly along the canal with a third-hand buggy that seemed too big for the towpath. The world had morphed into a series of threats \u2013 walkers, cyclists, smokers, nettles. Even the birds looked menacing, with their sharp beaks and presumed interest in the baby\u2019s shiny eyes. I wanted to turn back to the milky safety of the living room but, subconsciously recognising another threat looming, I didn\u2019t. That threat was me and the decision I knew I could easily make to smother her freedom and growth and give in to this seductive desire to protect her completely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew I could easily give in to the desire to protect her completely</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clinical psychologist <a href=\"https://www.psychologyexperts.org/experts/dr-rosanna-guilderthorp/\" title=\"\">Rosanna Gilderthorp</a> explains that the urge to helicopter over our children beyond babyhood is deeply understandable. \u201cOur brains obligingly help us protect our tiny, vulnerable babies until they can spot potential threats before they happen.\u201d However, because the threats of modern living are quite different to the ones our brains were built for (there aren\u2019t many wild bears in a child\u2019s nursery), it is often difficult for us to switch off our threat-spotting and let our kids play and explore the world.</p> <p>The negative impact of this, combined with other aspects of contemporary existence, is being felt by our kids. A study commissioned by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/children-spend-only-half-the-time-playing-outside-as-their-parents-did\" title=\"\">National Trust</a> found that children today spend half as much time playing outside as their parents did. Research by the National Children\u2019s Bureau revealed nearly 50% of parents let fear of strangers stop them allowing their children to play outside, despite the range of developmental and mental health benefits that outdoor-play brings. Perceptions of the dangers our children face are not borne out by the reality and studies indicate that helicopter parenting itself can trigger anxiety in some children. The restrictive, over-managed nature of children\u2019s play facilities has even encouraged the Health and Safety Executive to remind us that the goal of play is to manage not eliminate risk.</p> <p>Finding the ever-shifting point that keeps children away from harm while offering them opportunities to be useful, prove themselves and reap the rewards of being bold and brave is, for me, the goal and struggle of parenting. I want them to feel capable and confident enough to seize the day without worrying about my feelings, and yet I still hover under the monkey bars, shout \u201cCareful!\u201d more times than I care to count and instinctively try to shield them from emotional pain rather than helping them through it. My daughter tells me she doesn\u2019t like this side of my parenting. \u201cIt makes me too worried to do things,\u201d she explains. Contrasting this with the Burrow \u2013 where the adults are literally encouraging the children to safely play with fire \u2013 she prefers the latter. \u201cIt made me braver and proud of myself,\u201d she said.</p> <p><em><strong>Hoping he will</strong></em> help me finally break my helicopter habits, I speak to <a href=\"https://embercombe.org/experiential-learning-an-article-by-jo-clark/\" title=\"\">Jo Clark</a>, an experiential learning facilitator who has spent his working life guiding young people from a wide range of backgrounds \u2013 most recently through the year-round programme of residential activities for schools he runs at <a href=\"https://www.onthehill.camp/\" title=\"\">On the Hill Camp</a>. Clark designs and leads the Burrow and is a firm believer in dialling down on the restriction of kids\u2019 freedoms. \u201cChildren can\u2019t learn about the world, or their place in it, if they are not encouraged to step out of their comfort zone and to take risks safely,\u201d he asserts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want them to lead a life full of the chances to turn risks into joy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is critical of the narrow focus of our education system, saying much of it is irrelevant to the lives many children will go on to lead. He is conscious that a lot of young people walk away from their schooling without any feeling of success nor the chance to show they can make a valuable contribution to society. At the festival he notices how much kids want to show the adults with them that they are willing to take risks and to prove that they can do it safely. \u201cThe message the children are offering the adults is, \u2018Look you can trust me, I can make an informed judgment for myself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Though I struggle to embrace this style of parenting fully, seeing my children proving themselves in this way helps. And as I stand watching my daughter battle with her competing fears to decide whether to jump through the fire or to stand back, I realise two things. I know without a doubt that she can do it and that at least part of my desire to hold her back is to protect myself.</p> <p><em><strong>My children\u2019s pain</strong></em> sits heavily on me \u2013 much heavier than my own. Whether it is physical or emotional distress, our role as parents becomes sharply exposed when our children are hurting. We can hold them and whisper words of love, but ultimately we cannot make pain stop \u2013 and I have tried. Two years ago, watching my daughter writhing in agony as she waited for medics to arrive to attend to her badly broken arm, I begged for all the drugs they had until they had run out. I was asking for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/23/ketamine-can-it-really-be-antidepressant\" title=\"\">ketamine</a> and would have done almost anything to dampen her pain \u2013 or, better still, to rewind time and avoid the accident altogether \u2013 in part because I simply could not bear how much she was hurting. But she could and did bear it bravely. She learned she could cope with the pain and the limitation the injury caused her for a good while after. She learned to overcome her fears and get back to the sport that took her to hospital in the first place. Like so many of us, my daughter got something out of adversity \u2013 something she gets to keep for the rest of her life and call on in moments of doubt.</p> <p>This is the key to curbing my over-protective tendencies. Knowing I cannot protect my children from the pain that\u2019s in store for them in the adult world makes me want to cultivate their resilience now. I need them to be able to keep themselves safe because I cannot hope to do it for them. I don\u2019t want them to lead an anxious and fearful life, but one full of opportunity to turn risk into joy and excitement.</p> <p>So on that Saturday at Starry Skies I choke back a shout of \u201cCareful!\u201d I whoop and clap as Sofya steels herself to jump. She shouts, \u201cI have the courage,\u201d sets her face determinedly and makes the run, sailing through the fire into the cool air, full of possibility, on the other side. She still looks to me first for approval and I do a mad thumbs-up dance and her face cracks into a grin. And then she runs off to toast marshmallows with her new friends without a backward glance.</p>",

Perceptions of the dangers our children face are not borne out by the reality and studies indicate that helicopter parenting itself can trigger anxiety in some children. The restrictive, over-managed nature of children\u2019s play facilities has even encouraged the Health and Safety Executive to remind us that the goal of play is to manage not eliminate risk. Finding the ever-shifting point that keeps children away from harm while offering them opportunities to be useful, prove themselves and reap the rewards of being bold and brave is, for me, the goal and struggle of parenting. I want them to feel capable and confident enough to seize the day without worrying about my feelings, and yet I still hover under the monkey bars, shout \u201cCareful!\u201d more times than I care to count and instinctively try to shield them from emotional pain rather than helping them through it. My daughter tells me she doesn\u2019t like this side of my parenting. \u201cIt makes me too worried to do things,\u201d she explains. Contrasting this with the Burrow \u2013 where the adults are literally encouraging the children to safely play with fire \u2013 she prefers the latter. \u201cIt made me braver and proud of myself,\u201d she said. Hoping he will help me finally break my helicopter habits, I speak to Jo Clark, an experiential learning facilitator who has spent his working life guiding young people from a wide range of backgrounds \u2013 most recently through the year-round programme of residential activities for schools he runs at On the Hill Camp. Clark designs and leads the Burrow and is a firm believer in dialling down on the restriction of kids\u2019 freedoms. \u201cChildren can\u2019t learn about the world, or their place in it, if they are not encouraged to step out of their comfort zone and to take risks safely,\u201d he asserts. He is critical of the narrow focus of our education system, saying much of it is irrelevant to the lives many children will go on to lead. He is conscious that a lot of young people walk away from their schooling without any feeling of success nor the chance to show they can make a valuable contribution to society. At the festival he notices how much kids want to show the adults with them that they are willing to take risks and to prove that they can do it safely. \u201cThe message the children are offering the adults is, \u2018Look you can trust me, I can make an informed judgment for myself.\u2019\u201d Though I struggle to embrace this style of parenting fully, seeing my children proving themselves in this way helps. And as I stand watching my daughter battle with her competing fears to decide whether to jump through the fire or to stand back, I realise two things. I know without a doubt that she can do it and that at least part of my desire to hold her back is to protect myself. My children\u2019s pain sits heavily on me \u2013 much heavier than my own. Whether it is physical or emotional distress, our role as parents becomes sharply exposed when our children are hurting. We can hold them and whisper words of love, but ultimately we cannot make pain stop \u2013 and I have tried. Two years ago, watching my daughter writhing in agony as she waited for medics to arrive to attend to her badly broken arm, I begged for all the drugs they had until they had run out. I was asking for ketamine and would have done almost anything to dampen her pain \u2013 or, better still, to rewind time and avoid the accident altogether \u2013 in part because I simply could not bear how much she was hurting. But she could and did bear it bravely. She learned she could cope with the pain and the limitation the injury caused her for a good while after. She learned to overcome her fears and get back to the sport that took her to hospital in the first place. Like so many of us, my daughter got something out of adversity \u2013 something she gets to keep for the rest of her life and call on in moments of doubt. This is the key to curbing my over-protective tendencies. Knowing I cannot protect my children from the pain that\u2019s in store for them in the adult world makes me want to cultivate their resilience now. I need them to be able to keep themselves safe because I cannot hope to do it for them. I don\u2019t want them to lead an anxious and fearful life, but one full of opportunity to turn risk into joy and excitement. So on that Saturday at Starry Skies I choke back a shout of \u201cCareful!\u201d I whoop and clap as Sofya steels herself to jump. She shouts, \u201cI have the courage,\u201d sets her face determinedly and makes the run, sailing through the fire into the cool air, full of possibility, on the other side. She still looks to me first for approval and I do a mad thumbs-up dance and her face cracks into a grin. And then she runs off to toast marshmallows with her new friends without a backward glance.",

But it turns out that Newton\u2019s laws don\u2019t apply to subatomic particles; quantum theory evolved to explain what goes on in that strange space. The polite term for what goes on there is \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d. The less polite term is \u201cweird\u201d. In certain situations, for example, quantum theory says that one subatomic particle\u2019s behaviour is bound up with that of another, even if the second one is on the other side of the galaxy. This is known as \u201centanglement\u201d.

This is known in the jargon as \u201csuperposition\u201d.</p> <p>Superposition is at the heart of quantum computing. Ordinary computers work with bits that can be either on or off \u2013 coded as zero or one.

Now there is a danger that this service economy is becoming a servant economy.</p> <p>That is the view of the economics professor and biographer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/30/keynes-return-master-robert-skidelsky\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes,</a> Lord Skidelsky. He worries our attitude to work has hardened to a point where a cadre of managers and professionals is charged with bossing around an increasingly casualised workforce \u2013 one that is forced to contort domestic lives to suit the whims of those in charge and the profit motive.</p> <p>These workers must be prepared to work late and arrive early. They must work weekends when needs must and switch from task to task when it suits the manager. Worst of all, they must learn on the job through a method that can be likened to osmosis, with all the attendant stress and anxiety that goes with the absence of rigorous training or clear instruction.</p> <p>Managers, to give them some credit, behave in such a way to cope with the vagaries of business life, where so many decisions are tactical reactions to the capricious demands of shareholders and consumers.</p> <p>Skidelsky believes the sense of inevitability about this new form of serfdom is misplaced. He fully supports shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s refusal to accept that the only badge of honour worth having in the 21st century economy is one marked \u201cflexible\u201d, at least where that flexibility is at the discretion of the employer.</p> <p>In his report <a href=\"https://progressiveeconomyforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PEF_Skidelsky_How_to_achieve_shorter_working_hours.pdf\" title=\"\">How to Achieve Shorter Working Hours</a>, Skidelsky proposes that the government take on a new role as an \u201cemployer of last resort\u201d \u2013 not just supporting people out of work to find a job, but giving them a job where no others exist.</p> <p>Never before has a government provided such a guarantee. If it happened, workers would have the power to bid up wages and extract higher benefits, though the report recommends everyone focus on shorter working weeks as the goal.</p> <p>As Skidelsky says: \u201cA reduction in hours of necessary work should be a natural and desirable outcome of a progressive society. This requires the imagination to think of futures beyond just GDP growth.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So much more needs to happen. The basic costs of living, which drive workers to scramble for money, need to come down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McDonnell seized on the report and last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/john-mcdonnell-pledges-shorter-working-week-and-no-loss-of-pay\" title=\"\">told the Labour conference he would push for a blanket 32-hour week</a>. The report suggests a more nuanced approach, with some industries pushed harder towards this than others \u2013 starting with the public sector, which could demand compliance as the price of winning a contract.</p> <p>Without doubt the resistance will be fierce, and not just from managers and professionals threatened by improved workers\u2019 rights. Workers who seek to maximise their earnings will also vote against it, just as they did in the 1980s when the Tory party encouraged them to put self-reliance above all else, and unions did their best to make collective action look like an attempt to preserve a vanished past rather than the future of their members.</p> <p>The playwright David Hare discusses the underpinnings of individualism in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/09/peter-gynt-review-david-hare-ibsen-olivier-london\" title=\"\">new play <em>Peter Gynt</em></a>, which is running at the National Theatre until 8 October.</p> <p>Following the same theme found in Skidelsky\u2019s writing, <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/17760453.david-hare-writing-peter-gynt-scottish-voice-mother-liberating/\" title=\"\">Hare told the <em>Herald</em></a>: \u201cThe important thing is to knock on the head this idea that a spiritual journey is a journey you take alone. I think that has become a fashionable idea in the 21st century, that you can grow your own garden, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. In my life, my garden has grown through sharing things with other people, and anything important in it has come from that. I don\u2019t think the idea of being rich, famous and alone is a good way to be.\u201d</p> <p>In the play, Gynt \u2013 an amoral capitalist from humble origins who creates a fortune and then loses it while treating those around him shabbily \u2013 says: \u201cLife\u2019s a hell of a price to pay for being born.\u201d</p> <p>No one wants to work, treat those around them like economic pawns to be moved at will, then retire with as much money and assets as they can amass without any regard for the society this behaviour creates. But many are driven to do it and few seem to question why.</p> <p>If a jobs guarantee and a shorter working week are to be the bedrock of a fairer employment market, along with the regeneration of a once proud manufacturing sector, then so much more needs to happen. The basic costs of living, which drive workers to scramble for money above all else, need to come down, especially housing.</p> <p>As important is a fresh look at management and the lack of it in the workplace. A jobs guarantee is worthless without better managers, trained to celebrate the collective efforts of their colleagues and with time to plan for the future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy has long since made the shift from manufacturing things to providing services. Now there is a danger that this service economy is becoming a servant economy. That is the view of the economics professor and biographer of John Maynard Keynes, Lord Skidelsky. He worries our attitude to work has hardened to a point where a cadre of managers and professionals is charged with bossing around an increasingly casualised workforce \u2013 one that is forced to contort domestic lives to suit the whims of those in charge and the profit motive. These workers must be prepared to work late and arrive early. They must work weekends when needs must and switch from task to task when it suits the manager. Worst of all, they must learn on the job through a method that can be likened to osmosis, with all the attendant stress and anxiety that goes with the absence of rigorous training or clear instruction. Managers, to give them some credit, behave in such a way to cope with the vagaries of business life, where so many decisions are tactical reactions to the capricious demands of shareholders and consumers. Skidelsky believes the sense of inevitability about this new form of serfdom is misplaced. He fully supports shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s refusal to accept that the only badge of honour worth having in the 21st century economy is one marked \u201cflexible\u201d, at least where that flexibility is at the discretion of the employer. In his report How to Achieve Shorter Working Hours, Skidelsky proposes that the government take on a new role as an \u201cemployer of last resort\u201d \u2013 not just supporting people out of work to find a job, but giving them a job where no others exist. Never before has a government provided such a guarantee. If it happened, workers would have the power to bid up wages and extract higher benefits, though the report recommends everyone focus on shorter working weeks as the goal. As Skidelsky says: \u201cA reduction in hours of necessary work should be a natural and desirable outcome of a progressive society. This requires the imagination to think of futures beyond just GDP growth.\u201d McDonnell seized on the report and last week told the Labour conference he would push for a blanket 32-hour week. The report suggests a more nuanced approach, with some industries pushed harder towards this than others \u2013 starting with the public sector, which could demand compliance as the price of winning a contract. Without doubt the resistance will be fierce, and not just from managers and professionals threatened by improved workers\u2019 rights. Workers who seek to maximise their earnings will also vote against it, just as they did in the 1980s when the Tory party encouraged them to put self-reliance above all else, and unions did their best to make collective action look like an attempt to preserve a vanished past rather than the future of their members. The playwright David Hare discusses the underpinnings of individualism in his new play Peter Gynt, which is running at the National Theatre until 8 October. Following the same theme found in Skidelsky\u2019s writing, Hare told the Herald: \u201cThe important thing is to knock on the head this idea that a spiritual journey is a journey you take alone. I think that has become a fashionable idea in the 21st century, that you can grow your own garden, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. In my life, my garden has grown through sharing things with other people, and anything important in it has come from that. I don\u2019t think the idea of being rich, famous and alone is a good way to be.\u201d In the play, Gynt \u2013 an amoral capitalist from humble origins who creates a fortune and then loses it while treating those around him shabbily \u2013 says: \u201cLife\u2019s a hell of a price to pay for being born.\u201d No one wants to work, treat those around them like economic pawns to be moved at will, then retire with as much money and assets as they can amass without any regard for the society this behaviour creates. But many are driven to do it and few seem to question why. If a jobs guarantee and a shorter working week are to be the bedrock of a fairer employment market, along with the regeneration of a once proud manufacturing sector, then so much more needs to happen. The basic costs of living, which drive workers to scramble for money above all else, need to come down, especially housing. As important is a fresh look at management and the lack of it in the workplace. A jobs guarantee is worthless without better managers, trained to celebrate the collective efforts of their colleagues and with time to plan for the future.",

Fewer than 100 people were invited to see the 26-year-old play a studio in Hackney, but millions watched online; Sherelle went viral. The jungle and footwork music specialist is now one of the most talked about talents in club culture: two agents, her own record label, and a residency on BBC Radio 1 have followed.</p> <p>\u201cI amassed thousands of followers overnight,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cSome of them were DJs and producers who I love and respected for years.

The premise is simple: Boiler Room organise a wildly oversubscribed party, film the DJ playing a live set and then broadcast it online. More than two million people have subscribed to the YouTube channel, while three million follow the shows on Facebook. Now, nine years since Bellville says he \u201cstuck a webcam on a wall at a warehouse party and streamed it on the internet\u201d, Boiler Room is launching its first festival in Peckham next month.</p> <p>But how big has its impact on the industry really been \u2013 and is it still credible? \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d says <a href=\"https://found.ee/jaguar_reprezents\">Jaguar</a>, a DJ and broadcaster. \u201cSo many people have been able to make their careers on Boiler Room.

      "bodyText": "Six months ago Sherelle was ready to quit music for good, focus on the day job and give up the idea of being a professional DJ. Then her Boiler Room set happened. Fewer than 100 people were invited to see the 26-year-old play a studio in Hackney, but millions watched online; Sherelle went viral. The jungle and footwork music specialist is now one of the most talked about talents in club culture: two agents, her own record label, and a residency on BBC Radio 1 have followed. \u201cI amassed thousands of followers overnight,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cSome of them were DJs and producers who I love and respected for years. My mind was blown.\u201d Boiler Room\u2019s founder, 34-year-old Blaise Bellville, describes his company as \u201can independent music platform and cultural curator\u201d, one that connects underground club culture to fans worldwide via the internet. The premise is simple: Boiler Room organise a wildly oversubscribed party, film the DJ playing a live set and then broadcast it online. More than two million people have subscribed to the YouTube channel, while three million follow the shows on Facebook. Now, nine years since Bellville says he \u201cstuck a webcam on a wall at a warehouse party and streamed it on the internet\u201d, Boiler Room is launching its first festival in Peckham next month. But how big has its impact on the industry really been \u2013 and is it still credible? \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d says Jaguar, a DJ and broadcaster. \u201cSo many people have been able to make their careers on Boiler Room.

      "body": "<p>The last time Japan caused a major shock at a Rugby World Cup they made a movie about it. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report\" title=\"\">2015 Miracle of Brighton</a> was supposed to have been a complete one-off, never to be repeated. Now, suddenly, there is a blockbuster sequel that could generate even more at the box office. For the tournament organisers and everyone else seeking to promote rugby in Asia, this was the stuff of oval-shaped dreams.</p> \n<p>It will also hopefully transform a few perceptions elsewhere in the world. As anyone who watched this game will know, this was not some opportunist smash-and-grab raid but a richly deserved, fully justified victory over a team who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/ireland-wales-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">were recently ranked No 1 in the world</a>. Japan are supposed to be unworthy of so-called tier-one status but they have just harpooned one of the biggest whales in the sport.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/28/japan-ireland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\">Japan stun Ireland to pull off another famous Rugby World Cup upset</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What ripples this result will generate, across the sport and, crucially, beyond. As recently as 2011 Japan were so far down the pecking order that their best result was a draw with Canada. Now they are in with a chance to qualify for the quarter-finals ahead of Ireland and Scotland unless the latter can summon up something special in Tokyo in a fortnight. When the next set of world rankings are released this coming week they will be up to eighth, ahead of Scotland.</p> \n<p>That, in itself, makes this a historic moment. In some ways the Shizuoka sensation is even more significant than the Springbok surprise, so famously masterminded by Eddie Jones. The received wisdom was that only Jones could have conjured up such an extraordinary outcome, that Jamie Joseph\u2019s current team had an impossible act to follow. Not so. Ireland were beaten fair and square, outplayed by opponents who seemed to have plugged into an alternative energy source.</p> \n<p>By the end, Ireland were content to kick the ball out and retreat with a losing bonus point. Pragmatic, sure, but hardly what they envisaged when they flew east. Ireland have had plenty of World Cup disappointments but nothing like this. It remains possible they will still top the pool but any semblance of green impregnability has evaporated into the humid Japanese air. There remains a nagging sense Joe Schmidt\u2019s side peaked a year ago and here was further evidence to support the prosecution\u2019s case.</p> \n<p>This, though, was primarily a Japanese triumph, not some generous Irish gift. Not everyone in Japan is a rugby fan by any means but this is how to attract new admirers. In fan zones and bars across this extraordinary country, the outpouring of joy was something to behold. Respect and honour are everything here and Joseph\u2019s team are suitably full of samurai warrior spirit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2d0fe9d5-677a-4cf9-a9a7-954d59c48de0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G0RY3cl60os?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Not every host nation is inspired by the extra pressure of a World Cup on home soil. The opposite was true of England in 2015 and, four years on, there was more than a hint of nerves during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/20/japan-overcome-dogged-russia-win-opening-rugby-world-cup-match\" title=\"\">Japan\u2019s slightly stuttering opening night victory over Russia</a>. There was absolutely nothing tentative, however, about their second-half display in Shizuoka. Once ahead only they looked like seizing the day. Ireland, lauded for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/22/rugby-world-cup-ireland-scotland-match-report\" title=\"\">purposeful forward effort against Scotland</a>, were plodding through treacle by the end. No one, on this evidence, will want to play the Brave Blossoms in the last eight.</p> \n<p>If nothing else it will hopefully be the emotional bullet train that delivers rugby to a whole new audience. Historically, rugby has often been too insular in its outlook, making decisions primarily for the few and not the many. In certain respects that is still the case but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/uruguay-shock-fiji-to-pull-off-historic-victory-in-classic-encounter\" title=\"\">Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji</a>, Russia\u2019s defiance, the United States\u2019 growing appetite for the sport and now Japan\u2019s glorious uprising have offered a tantalising glimpse of exciting new horizons.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The decision to stage the tournament in Japan has certainly been vindicated. Ticket sales were already healthy but, at this rate, interest levels will disappear off the scale.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the night\u2019s most striking image was of youthful Japanese fans in the crowd almost beside themselves with open-mouthed excitement. The best sporting events have their unforgettable snapshots and the first World Cup on Asian soil is now guaranteed to leave an indelible impression.</p> \n<p>Not only the greatest World Cup upset of all time, but the Miracle of Brighton was also the biggest shock in rugby history. Two-time winners South Africa fell to an injury-time try by Karne Hesketh for the rank outsiders to make it Japan 34 South Africa 32. The win effectively secured Eddie Jones, then Japan\u2019s coach, the England job he now holds.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time Japan caused a major shock at a Rugby World Cup they made a movie about it. The 2015 Miracle of Brighton was supposed to have been a complete one-off, never to be repeated. Now, suddenly, there is a blockbuster sequel that could generate even more at the box office. For the tournament organisers and everyone else seeking to promote rugby in Asia, this was the stuff of oval-shaped dreams. It will also hopefully transform a few perceptions elsewhere in the world. As anyone who watched this game will know, this was not some opportunist smash-and-grab raid but a richly deserved, fully justified victory over a team who were recently ranked No 1 in the world. Japan are supposed to be unworthy of so-called tier-one status but they have just harpooned one of the biggest whales in the sport. What ripples this result will generate, across the sport and, crucially, beyond. As recently as 2011 Japan were so far down the pecking order that their best result was a draw with Canada. Now they are in with a chance to qualify for the quarter-finals ahead of Ireland and Scotland unless the latter can summon up something special in Tokyo in a fortnight. When the next set of world rankings are released this coming week they will be up to eighth, ahead of Scotland. That, in itself, makes this a historic moment. In some ways the Shizuoka sensation is even more significant than the Springbok surprise, so famously masterminded by Eddie Jones. The received wisdom was that only Jones could have conjured up such an extraordinary outcome, that Jamie Joseph\u2019s current team had an impossible act to follow. Not so. Ireland were beaten fair and square, outplayed by opponents who seemed to have plugged into an alternative energy source. By the end, Ireland were content to kick the ball out and retreat with a losing bonus point. Pragmatic, sure, but hardly what they envisaged when they flew east. Ireland have had plenty of World Cup disappointments but nothing like this. It remains possible they will still top the pool but any semblance of green impregnability has evaporated into the humid Japanese air. There remains a nagging sense Joe Schmidt\u2019s side peaked a year ago and here was further evidence to support the prosecution\u2019s case. This, though, was primarily a Japanese triumph, not some generous Irish gift. Not everyone in Japan is a rugby fan by any means but this is how to attract new admirers. In fan zones and bars across this extraordinary country, the outpouring of joy was something to behold. Respect and honour are everything here and Joseph\u2019s team are suitably full of samurai warrior spirit. Not every host nation is inspired by the extra pressure of a World Cup on home soil. The opposite was true of England in 2015 and, four years on, there was more than a hint of nerves during Japan\u2019s slightly stuttering opening night victory over Russia. There was absolutely nothing tentative, however, about their second-half display in Shizuoka. Once ahead only they looked like seizing the day. Ireland, lauded for their purposeful forward effort against Scotland, were plodding through treacle by the end. No one, on this evidence, will want to play the Brave Blossoms in the last eight. If nothing else it will hopefully be the emotional bullet train that delivers rugby to a whole new audience. Historically, rugby has often been too insular in its outlook, making decisions primarily for the few and not the many. In certain respects that is still the case but Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji, Russia\u2019s defiance, the United States\u2019 growing appetite for the sport and now Japan\u2019s glorious uprising have offered a tantalising glimpse of exciting new horizons. The decision to stage the tournament in Japan has certainly been vindicated. Ticket sales were already healthy but, at this rate, interest levels will disappear off the scale. Perhaps the night\u2019s most striking image was of youthful Japanese fans in the crowd almost beside themselves with open-mouthed excitement. The best sporting events have their unforgettable snapshots and the first World Cup on Asian soil is now guaranteed to leave an indelible impression. Not only the greatest World Cup upset of all time, but the Miracle of Brighton was also the biggest shock in rugby history. Two-time winners South Africa fell to an injury-time try by Karne Hesketh for the rank outsiders to make it Japan 34 South Africa 32. The win effectively secured Eddie Jones, then Japan\u2019s coach, the England job he now holds.",

This protest is more than just a message, it is a demand for politicians to take proper action.\u201d</p> <p>They can be assured that at least their mayor, Stefano Miserocchi, is taking the issue seriously. Miserocchi was quick to act last week when experts at the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountain Foundation) in the Aosta Valley said up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice were at risk of sliding off the Planpincieux. The glacier, which has been closely monitored since 2013, is always moving, but the size of a recent fracture and a significant increase in the speed at which the ice is melting raised the alarm. The area is popular with hikers, so as a safety precaution Miserocchi closed mountain refuges and part of a road upon which the ice could directly fall. Contrary to initial reports, only one home had to be evacuated. The other 10 or so in the hamlet beneath the glacier are empty holiday homes. But there is nonetheless deep unease. Can the glacier hold on? For how long?</p> <p>\u201cEach year you see how much the glacier changes,\u201d Miserocchi told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThe average temperature has risen to the point where, in winter, ice is no longer being recreated because even though it snows, the temperature doesn\u2019t get cold enough. Where there was once ice, there is now rock.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists are unable to predict when the mass of ice might collapse, but Miserocchi is not taking any chances as the glacier\u2019s transformation has already cost lives. In August last year, a heavy storm unleashed a debris flow, killing an elderly couple when their car was swept from the road that is currently closed. Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from their homes. In January, a breakage in the wall of ice caused an avalanche, narrowly missing homes.</p> <p>Safe Mountain Foundation experts are monitoring 184 glaciers in the Aosta Valley region. There are 4,000 glaciers across the Mont Blanc massif, the highest mountain range in Europe, which straddles Italy, France and Switzerland. Scientists predict that if emissions continue to rise at the current rate, the Alpine glaciers would shed half of their ice by 2050.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e620664f3ffad68381efd6703d2a4e837a3bc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e620664f3ffad68381efd6703d2a4e837a3bc5/0_0_5472_3284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A helicopter flies over the glacier above Val Ferret, a popular hiking area.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A helicopter flies over the glacier above Val Ferret, a popular hiking area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fabrizio Troilo, a geologist at the foundation, reels off a list of historical disasters caused by collapsing glaciers. In 1965, two million cubic metres of ice and debris fell from the Allalin glacier in the Swiss canton of Valais, killing 88 workers at the Mattmark dam construction site below. Five years later, an earthquake triggered the collapse of an unstable glacier in Peru, burying the town of Yungay and killing more than 20,000 people. In 1892, 200,000 cubic metres of water and ice that had collected in a cavity on the T\u00eate-Rousse glacier in France burst through the ice, triggering a flood that cost 175 lives.</p> <p>More recently, a stream burst its banks in the Swiss resort of Zermatt in July, caused by glacial meltwater .</p> <p>\u201cThese are rare events, but all glaciers under certain circumstances can have different behaviours that can be dangerous, not so much for climbers but for people living in the area,\u201d said Troilo.</p> <p>In Aosta alone, the team has recorded a massive loss of ice across the region\u2019s glaciers, he added.</p> <p>\u201cWe use all the latest technology \u2026 but it\u2019s not easy to detect a lake that forms underneath the surface. For example, in Zermatt there was an outburst even though the glacier was being continuously monitored.\u201d</p> <p>As for the Planpincieux glacier, Troilo said that \u201ceverything is under control\u201d, and in the worst-case scenario the ice would fall in the direction of the road and not on the cluster of homes in the area of Val Ferret.</p> <p>Looking towards the glacier from the hamlet below, Rocco Raffaele, the manager responsible for the defence of the territory at Aosta\u2019s regional authority, said news of the potential collapse probably wouldn\u2019t have attracted as much attention had it not emerged during the week of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/18/un-secretary-general-climate-crisis-trump\" title=\"\">UN climate action summit in New York</a>. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the warning that part of Mont Blanc risked collapsing \u201cmust shake us all and force us to mobilise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut the Alps have been feeling the effects of climate change for a long time,\u201d said Raffaele. \u201cAs a glacier disappears, the material extracts beneath it become exposed, and when it rains, like it did in August last year, that material gets deposited down.\u201d</p> <p>In the event of a collapse, it would take less than two minutes for the mass to reach the municipal road.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a danger, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to shut everything down,\u201d said Raffaele. \u201cIt simply means being aware and understanding how to be responsible in the mountains.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbae588b0546cd84dc64b4fba0701f8256652dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbae588b0546cd84dc64b4fba0701f8256652dc4/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Homes have been evacuated from underneath the glacier.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homes have been evacuated from underneath the glacier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, as worried tourists frantically called hotels to inquire if they should cancel their trips to Courmayeur, those running tourism businesses were unhappy that the news had generated so much attention.</p> <p>\u201cThis could be really damaging for us,\u201d said Luca Savaglia from the Alpine Guides Society, which organises mountain excursions. \u201cThis particular glacier has always moved, and there are no hiking paths there, no climbing \u2026 we haven\u2019t had any cancellations, but a lot of people have called to ask what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>Residents were also unhappy that newspapers gave the impression that their town was in danger, while Jean Pierre Fosson, secretary-general of the Safe Mountain Foundation, was left fuming after Greenpeace released an inaccurate statement.</p> <p>\u201cThey said the situation was very dangerous in Courmayeur and that lots of homes were evacuated, but Planpincieux is 7km away from Courmayeur,\u201d said Fosson. \u201cWe would never say a situation is not serious, but at the same time we have to give the correct information as we don\u2019t want people living here to leave.\u201d</p> <p>But in a week during which millions of children took part in a global climate strike inspired by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, experts are pleased the news has helped draw attention to the vulnerability of glaciers. The children of Courmayeur were among the estimated one million young Italian protesters.</p> <p>Raffaele said that the emotion galvanised by Thunberg now needed to be turned into concrete action. However, while children blame adults for breaking their environment, he advised them to also reflect on their own behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cMy 10-year-old daughter keeps telling me to stop doing lots of things, such as keeping the tap running while brushing my teeth,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she is the one who leaves the lights on and takes hot showers for 30 minutes. They have an awareness that is superior to ours, but they also need to change their habits.\u201d</p>",

Scientists predict that if emissions continue to rise at the current rate, the Alpine glaciers would shed half of their ice by 2050. Fabrizio Troilo, a geologist at the foundation, reels off a list of historical disasters caused by collapsing glaciers. In 1965, two million cubic metres of ice and debris fell from the Allalin glacier in the Swiss canton of Valais, killing 88 workers at the Mattmark dam construction site below. Five years later, an earthquake triggered the collapse of an unstable glacier in Peru, burying the town of Yungay and killing more than 20,000 people. In 1892, 200,000 cubic metres of water and ice that had collected in a cavity on the T\u00eate-Rousse glacier in France burst through the ice, triggering a flood that cost 175 lives. More recently, a stream burst its banks in the Swiss resort of Zermatt in July, caused by glacial meltwater . \u201cThese are rare events, but all glaciers under certain circumstances can have different behaviours that can be dangerous, not so much for climbers but for people living in the area,\u201d said Troilo. In Aosta alone, the team has recorded a massive loss of ice across the region\u2019s glaciers, he added. \u201cWe use all the latest technology \u2026 but it\u2019s not easy to detect a lake that forms underneath the surface. For example, in Zermatt there was an outburst even though the glacier was being continuously monitored.\u201d As for the Planpincieux glacier, Troilo said that \u201ceverything is under control\u201d, and in the worst-case scenario the ice would fall in the direction of the road and not on the cluster of homes in the area of Val Ferret. Looking towards the glacier from the hamlet below, Rocco Raffaele, the manager responsible for the defence of the territory at Aosta\u2019s regional authority, said news of the potential collapse probably wouldn\u2019t have attracted as much attention had it not emerged during the week of the UN climate action summit in New York. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the warning that part of Mont Blanc risked collapsing \u201cmust shake us all and force us to mobilise\u201d. \u201cBut the Alps have been feeling the effects of climate change for a long time,\u201d said Raffaele. \u201cAs a glacier disappears, the material extracts beneath it become exposed, and when it rains, like it did in August last year, that material gets deposited down.\u201d In the event of a collapse, it would take less than two minutes for the mass to reach the municipal road. \u201cThere is a danger, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to shut everything down,\u201d said Raffaele. \u201cIt simply means being aware and understanding how to be responsible in the mountains.\u201d But, as worried tourists frantically called hotels to inquire if they should cancel their trips to Courmayeur, those running tourism businesses were unhappy that the news had generated so much attention. \u201cThis could be really damaging for us,\u201d said Luca Savaglia from the Alpine Guides Society, which organises mountain excursions. \u201cThis particular glacier has always moved, and there are no hiking paths there, no climbing \u2026 we haven\u2019t had any cancellations, but a lot of people have called to ask what is going on.\u201d Residents were also unhappy that newspapers gave the impression that their town was in danger, while Jean Pierre Fosson, secretary-general of the Safe Mountain Foundation, was left fuming after Greenpeace released an inaccurate statement. \u201cThey said the situation was very dangerous in Courmayeur and that lots of homes were evacuated, but Planpincieux is 7km away from Courmayeur,\u201d said Fosson. \u201cWe would never say a situation is not serious, but at the same time we have to give the correct information as we don\u2019t want people living here to leave.\u201d But in a week during which millions of children took part in a global climate strike inspired by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, experts are pleased the news has helped draw attention to the vulnerability of glaciers. The children of Courmayeur were among the estimated one million young Italian protesters. Raffaele said that the emotion galvanised by Thunberg now needed to be turned into concrete action. However, while children blame adults for breaking their environment, he advised them to also reflect on their own behaviour. \u201cMy 10-year-old daughter keeps telling me to stop doing lots of things, such as keeping the tap running while brushing my teeth,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she is the one who leaves the lights on and takes hot showers for 30 minutes. They have an awareness that is superior to ours, but they also need to change their habits.\u201d",

After the March date for leaving the EU passed, we noticed some people \u2013 particularly from white, British families \u2013 starting to demonstrate that anger more often inside school.</p> <p>For example, we\u2019ve had more parents coming into school and shouting at me and my staff when they get frustrated. There have also been times parents have shouted at children in the playground who have upset their own child. There\u2019s been no chance to say: let\u2019s discuss this and find out what happened. There\u2019s just been immediate anger and a conviction that they\u2019re right. We see that in school now with the children as well. They can\u2019t listen to each other. Everything is black and white. There\u2019s no grey. We witness a lot more physical violence from children. There is more aggression and confrontation, and less tolerance.</p> <p>Sometimes our students see people shouting on the TV about Brexit. They don\u2019t understand it and they feel anxious. It\u2019s difficult for us, as teachers, to unpick what is happening and explain it. We have had some challenging conversations with children who feel worried about losing their European friends.</p> <p>Our country\u2019s leaders demand of us, in schools, to teach our children tolerance, respect and British values. But they are not demonstrating those values themselves. We live in a much more angry society now and I think parents are taking out their frustrations about the government on public servants like us. They are using us as a punchbag.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ed Finch, teacher, Larkrise primary school, Oxford There\u2019s another general election coming and I am sick to my stomach at the thought of how I\u2019ll discuss that in class or in assembly. How can I present, in a balanced and non-judgmental way, the appalling invective that has been normalised these last few weeks? How can I suggest to pupils that adults who posture, threaten, lie and break the law are worthy of our respect? We are required to teach \u201cBritish values\u201d \u2013 values such as democracy, pride in diversity, respect for the rule of law. How can we present any of these with a straight face? Our school is diverse in every sense. Children from every part of the globe learn together, and our staff are multicultural too. For many of them, this is a scary time. Will they be permitted to remain in the UK? Even if they are permitted to remain, is this still a country in which they feel welcome and safe? Conversation in the staff room is strained. We tread carefully, not knowing where people\u2019s worries lie. More than one staff member has told me of cruel words in the street. Some children are anxious \u2013 just yesterday I had to have a calming conversation with a six-year-old child who had misunderstood the judgment of the supreme court to mean that Brexit was going ahead immediately. Like the rest of us, I\u2019m confused, angry and anxious, too, and it took a good deal of my skills gained from decades in the classroom to put on my reassuring face and convince her all would be well. As a teacher trying to mould young people who feel safe and empowered to be active citizens of the future, the changes to our political life make me feel helpless in a way I have never felt before. Kevin Patel, deputy headteacher, Harrow high school My school is very diverse and there are lots of students from Europe, particularly eastern Europe. They have come here for a better life and now they feel uncertain about whether they can stay and what fees they will be charged for university if they do. As a result, there is a growing sense among the GCSE and A-level students that they will go back to their native country, instead of attending university here. Motivation has dropped off among some of these students over the past year and their grades are falling too. They don\u2019t seem to care as much about their schoolwork. Colleagues from Europe, meanwhile, feel very worried. The nation is divided and it\u2019s hard for us, as teachers, to remain impartial. We are living in such a time of political turmoil that at the end of the last academic year we decided to start discussing topical issues on a weekly basis. We are careful to show students both sides of a political argument. Then we vote as a school. I hope that by proactively giving students space and time to debate politics we will make sure things don\u2019t spill out into the playground. Clearly, there is a need for young people to see that democracy can work, that they are part of the political process. I want to make sure that when our students become voters they will feel they can shape their own destiny. Anthony White, headteacher, Pound Hill junior school, Crawley Ever since the referendum result, levels of anger about Brexit have slowly been building among parents and, consequently, their children. After the March date for leaving the EU passed, we noticed some people \u2013 particularly from white, British families \u2013 starting to demonstrate that anger more often inside school. For example, we\u2019ve had more parents coming into school and shouting at me and my staff when they get frustrated. There have also been times parents have shouted at children in the playground who have upset their own child. There\u2019s been no chance to say: let\u2019s discuss this and find out what happened. There\u2019s just been immediate anger and a conviction that they\u2019re right. We see that in school now with the children as well. They can\u2019t listen to each other. Everything is black and white. There\u2019s no grey. We witness a lot more physical violence from children. There is more aggression and confrontation, and less tolerance. Sometimes our students see people shouting on the TV about Brexit. They don\u2019t understand it and they feel anxious. It\u2019s difficult for us, as teachers, to unpick what is happening and explain it. We have had some challenging conversations with children who feel worried about losing their European friends. Our country\u2019s leaders demand of us, in schools, to teach our children tolerance, respect and British values. But they are not demonstrating those values themselves. We live in a much more angry society now and I think parents are taking out their frustrations about the government on public servants like us. They are using us as a punchbag.",

They were a housewarming gift from Storey\u2019s mother. \u201cI like to bring in colour through furniture, it makes it more soulful,\u201d explains Storey. A clear-glass 70s-style coffee table with curved chrome legs by Richard Young for Merrow Associates sits on a vibrant patterned rug from Galerie Jama in Morocco. Storey found it in a house sale in Norfolk.</p> <p>He is also a regular browser of internet antique and auction sites. \u201cI like finding vintage furniture. Everybody can own new stuff, but it\u2019s more interesting when you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from,\u201d he says. Standouts include a 1950s oval opaline glass chandelier with pendant lights that float like satellites in the open hallway space, found on eBay and originally from an old building in Amsterdam. New purchases include a trio of three-legged 1950s Hans Wegner \u201cHeart\u201d chairs for Fritz Hansen in the dining area and a pastel-pink abstract oil painting by Albert Riera Galceran. It hangs above the kaleidoscopic palette of Dutch designer Dirk Vander Kooij\u2019s \u201cMelting Pot\u201d table, uniquely made from recycled plastics. \u201cI had to buy that table,\u201d says Storey, \u201cit\u2019s a piece of sculpture.\u201d </p> <p>Other design touches are artful and discreet. Appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Volet Pivotant dimmer lights by Charlotte Perriand are strategically stationed along the wall of the bright and airy upper floor where a rooflight punctuates the raised ceiling, bringing in daylight and making the place feel bigger and airier.

Bare timber beams inside the pitched roof are revealed to soften the space: \u201cThat area is usually plasterboarded up in these old Victorian houses, but I opened it all up to bring more warmth into the room. I stayed at a hotel in Lake Garda in Italy that had exposed beams, and it looked so beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Downstairs on the lower level is housemate and photographer Jeff Hahn\u2019s bedroom, and a dark burgundy-hued bathroom with mirrored wall cupboards and a handmade sink by Lusso Stone, electrified by floor-to-ceiling terrazzo shower tiles by Diespeker &amp; Co. Odd flecks of the marble meticulously match the wall palette, as does the coloured silicone sealant. Detail is everything to Storey.</p> <p>There is a restrained mix of interesting curios and decorative memories everywhere, from imperfect pottery vases to a hexagonal stoneware incense burner by ceramicist Ben Medansky and an oak prototype of Storey\u2019s own Formative floor lamp. This is his first foray into product design for Kalmar, created by his late father, a carpenter and hobbyist. \u201cHe wanted to make it for me, and it\u2019s one of my most precious possessions,\u201d says Storey. The disordered lines of an azurite malachite gemstone bought from a crystal shop while on a road trip in Marfa, Texas, also add a spiritual spin.</p> <p>Storey\u2019s emotional connection to where he lives has resulted in a serene space with tactile surfaces and immersive tones. It is designed to be harmonious and provides a calm environment in which Storey can do the odd headstand or downward-facing dog. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with yoga, and having a studio near me was really important when I was looking. The one I\u2019ve been going to for four years was right at the end of this street, so it turned out to be the perfect place to live.\u201d </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.storeystudio.com/\" title=\"\">storeystudio.com</a></em></p>",

Clever design tricks, including hidden appliance cupboards and concealed cabinetry inside an old chimney breast, provide storage, but also maximise space. The adjoining living area favours rich fabrics and textiles, quirky furniture, and bold bright colours, such as the modular sofa by Paustian (designed by Erik Rasmussen in 1969), upholstered in a striking blue (Haakon 2 by Raf Simons for Kvadrat), which stands opposite two teak midcentury Finn Juhl \u201cJapan\u201d chairs by France &amp; S\u00f8n with lemon yellow cushions. They were a housewarming gift from Storey\u2019s mother. \u201cI like to bring in colour through furniture, it makes it more soulful,\u201d explains Storey. A clear-glass 70s-style coffee table with curved chrome legs by Richard Young for Merrow Associates sits on a vibrant patterned rug from Galerie Jama in Morocco. Storey found it in a house sale in Norfolk. He is also a regular browser of internet antique and auction sites. \u201cI like finding vintage furniture. Everybody can own new stuff, but it\u2019s more interesting when you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from,\u201d he says. Standouts include a 1950s oval opaline glass chandelier with pendant lights that float like satellites in the open hallway space, found on eBay and originally from an old building in Amsterdam. New purchases include a trio of three-legged 1950s Hans Wegner \u201cHeart\u201d chairs for Fritz Hansen in the dining area and a pastel-pink abstract oil painting by Albert Riera Galceran. It hangs above the kaleidoscopic palette of Dutch designer Dirk Vander Kooij\u2019s \u201cMelting Pot\u201d table, uniquely made from recycled plastics. \u201cI had to buy that table,\u201d says Storey, \u201cit\u2019s a piece of sculpture.\u201d Other design touches are artful and discreet. Appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Volet Pivotant dimmer lights by Charlotte Perriand are strategically stationed along the wall of the bright and airy upper floor where a rooflight punctuates the raised ceiling, bringing in daylight and making the place feel bigger and airier. A concealed wall entrance reveals a handy elevated loft-cum-laundry space that leads to a small guest room with a cast-iron fireplace Storey found on eBay. Next is his bedroom, where a shelf in between the neatly bespoke wooden wardrobes and bed is lined with books and collected mementos, such as pine cones from Cyprus (\u201cI always like to bring something back from my travels to remind me of the place\u201d), and a cubic white ceramic ashtray left behind in the property by previous tenants. \u201cI kept it as I just love the unusual design,\u201d he says. Bare timber beams inside the pitched roof are revealed to soften the space: \u201cThat area is usually plasterboarded up in these old Victorian houses, but I opened it all up to bring more warmth into the room. I stayed at a hotel in Lake Garda in Italy that had exposed beams, and it looked so beautiful.\u201d Downstairs on the lower level is housemate and photographer Jeff Hahn\u2019s bedroom, and a dark burgundy-hued bathroom with mirrored wall cupboards and a handmade sink by Lusso Stone, electrified by floor-to-ceiling terrazzo shower tiles by Diespeker &amp; Co. Odd flecks of the marble meticulously match the wall palette, as does the coloured silicone sealant. Detail is everything to Storey. There is a restrained mix of interesting curios and decorative memories everywhere, from imperfect pottery vases to a hexagonal stoneware incense burner by ceramicist Ben Medansky and an oak prototype of Storey\u2019s own Formative floor lamp. This is his first foray into product design for Kalmar, created by his late father, a carpenter and hobbyist. \u201cHe wanted to make it for me, and it\u2019s one of my most precious possessions,\u201d says Storey. The disordered lines of an azurite malachite gemstone bought from a crystal shop while on a road trip in Marfa, Texas, also add a spiritual spin. Storey\u2019s emotional connection to where he lives has resulted in a serene space with tactile surfaces and immersive tones. It is designed to be harmonious and provides a calm environment in which Storey can do the odd headstand or downward-facing dog. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with yoga, and having a studio near me was really important when I was looking. The one I\u2019ve been going to for four years was right at the end of this street, so it turned out to be the perfect place to live.\u201d storeystudio.com",

Amorphous, red velvety shapes dangle from the sky, wriggle through hoops and lie strewn on the floor. Is this an enormous penis with a comic extrusion of glass bubbles at one end? And what\u2019s happened to that arm, grotesquely disfigured and topped with a giant green hand?</p> <p>Who knows what\u2019s going on? Shani, you suspect.

Of all the work shortlisted this year, it\u2019s his that feels most coherent, skilled and sensitive. It\u2019s impossible to leave unchanged by it. He offers two short films and a lightbox for this exhibition. Together they present his investigations into the acoustics of incarceration. Hamdan has assembled his own personal sound-effects library in an effort to replicate the aural memories of former prisoners. They include inmates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/18/saydnaya-prison-syria-assad-amnesty-reconstruction\" title=\"\">Saydnaya</a> prison in Syria, widely acknowledged as a site for torture and executions.</p> <p>Hamdan is the dispassionate sound engineer, trying out objects that are endlessly flicked, flailed, brushed and struck into microphones. But the human brutality is never really at bay. The films are compulsively interesting, tracking both his technical experimentations and the graver realisations he comes to over the course of the project. The sound of a person being hit resembles the demolition of a wall.

The project is so wildly idiosyncratic that\u2019s its hard to know quite where to begin. Amorphous, red velvety shapes dangle from the sky, wriggle through hoops and lie strewn on the floor. Is this an enormous penis with a comic extrusion of glass bubbles at one end? And what\u2019s happened to that arm, grotesquely disfigured and topped with a giant green hand? Who knows what\u2019s going on? Shani, you suspect. She refers us to the French medieval moralist Christine de Pizan, esoteric mythologies and feminist theory. But perhaps imagining an alternative reality for women is only really a radical act when it refuses to be so easily understood. It\u2019s all so bracingly bonkers, that after a while you start to wonder when you landed on this strange planet and how Shani came to be its benevolent ruler. Lawrence Abu Hamdan is trying to understand something in his project, too. Of all the work shortlisted this year, it\u2019s his that feels most coherent, skilled and sensitive. It\u2019s impossible to leave unchanged by it. He offers two short films and a lightbox for this exhibition. Together they present his investigations into the acoustics of incarceration. Hamdan has assembled his own personal sound-effects library in an effort to replicate the aural memories of former prisoners. They include inmates of Saydnaya prison in Syria, widely acknowledged as a site for torture and executions. Hamdan is the dispassionate sound engineer, trying out objects that are endlessly flicked, flailed, brushed and struck into microphones. But the human brutality is never really at bay. The films are compulsively interesting, tracking both his technical experimentations and the graver realisations he comes to over the course of the project. The sound of a person being hit resembles the demolition of a wall. You\u2019ll walk away and it won\u2019t be just your footsteps ringing in your ears.

      "body": "<p>Al Alvarez, who died last week, was one of Bloomsbury\u2019s most glamorous authors. For the last two decades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/23/al-alvarez-obituary\" title=\"\">his extraordinary and varied life</a> we had the great luck of being his publisher. Our first encounter with Al was through one of his lifelong addictions, poker; we published an illustrated book with that title. Al was in his 70s then. By the time I met him, he had climbed mountains, flown planes, driven fast cars, won and lost money, broken hearts and had his broken. He had published novels, poetry, anthologies and a number of unusual nonfiction books. Inevitably he was slowing down; mountains and epic drinking were in the past. He could still deal a mean set of cards and do what he did best, write. A sucker for men who make me laugh, I immediately fell under his spell. As did our all-male design department, who took to playing poker in their lunch hours.</p> <p>Al and his wife, Anne, lived in a minuscule cottage in Hampstead, north London. To get to Al\u2019s study you had to climb to the top, a mountaineering exercise of its own. There he sat, sucking on his pipe, cracking jokes and swearing a lot, usually about his age. \u201cI\u2019m past my sell-by date,\u201d he often complained. The house was crammed with books and pictures, including work by his friend the Australian painter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/14/sidney-nolan-australian-art-transferences-pallant-house-chichester-ned-kelly\" title=\"\">Sidney Nolan</a>, who he had met in New Mexico.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pondlife was a moving meditation on life\u2019s small pleasures... or, as he said, the three Ss \u2013 swimming, sleep and sex</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Al was born in Bloomsbury in 1929, but his parents moved to Hampstead when he was a few months old because, he said, \u201cIt was full of their kind of Jews \u2013 comfortably off and thoroughly anglicised.\u201d Al arrived in the world with a growth at the base of his left leg and when just a few months old the growth was cut away leaving a scar that looked like a giant zipper and took 30 years to fade. The cyst grew back and his tiny leg was packed with radium and enclosed in a miniature riding boot made of lead. A childhood full of illness and pain somehow made him a person who experienced no physical fear. He was small, but he boxed, played rugby and flung himself at any physical challenge. His childhood wasn\u2019t short of emotional challenges. His early love was his nanny and he suffered his first experience of abandonment and grief at the age of six when she was dismissed, whereupon he howled at the sunset \u201clike an abandoned puppy\u201d.</p> <p>At Oundle school he was a difficult pupil, but in 1949 he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

He became poetry editor of the <em>Observer</em> in 1956 and for the next 10 years he published such established poets as Graves, Auden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/louis-macneice\" title=\"\">MacNeice</a>, Larkin, Amis and Enright, discovered the then lesser known poets Ted Hughes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/10/selected-poems-of-thom-gunn-edited-by-clive-wilmer-review-life-on-the-edge\" title=\"\">Thom Gunn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/mar/01/robert-lowell-at-100-poetry-centenary\" title=\"\">Robert Lowell</a> and also published poetry in translation including Zbigniew Herbert and Miroslav Holub. His friendship with Sylvia Plath had a profound impact on him. He published her late poems at a time when few other British publications would take them. In 1960 Al tried to kill himself. Three years later Plath herself committed suicide. He described these events in his best-known work, <em>The Savage God</em>. His own attempt was precipitated by the end of his marriage to Ursula Barr, the granddaughter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/18/frieda-original-lady-chatterley-review-annabel-abbs-dh-lawrence\" title=\"\">Frieda Lawrence</a>. Al\u2019s obsession with DH Lawrence had propelled him into the marriage. After the divorce, Al said: \u201cAt least it cured me of my passion for Lawrence.\u201d He wrote a book about his divorce, <em>Life After Marriage</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/karl-miller\" title=\"\">Karl Miller</a>, the editor of the <em>London Review of Books</em>, commissioned Al\u2019s ex-wife to review it.

      "bodyText": "Slaven Bilic likened West Brom full-back Nathan Ferguson to Declan Rice after his superb goal inspired his team to a victory against 10-man QPR that takes them top of the table. The visitors dominated the lunchtime kick-off at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium from start to finish, and were rewarded when Ferguson, an 18-year-old West Brom academy graduate, beat Joe Lumley at his near post with a long-range effort in the 53rd minute \u2013 his first senior goal for the club. After Yoann Barbet was shown a straight red card for his last-man foul on Hal Robson-Kanu, Matheus Pereira slot in the resulting free-kick to send Bilic\u2019s side top of the Championship table, keeping intact their unbeaten start to the season in the process. And Bilic, who handed Rice his first senior appearance at West Ham in May 2017, said of Ferguson: \u201cHe lost a few balls after he scored the goal so he\u2019s young and he can get carried away but it wasn\u2019t costly for us. \u201cNathan is talented: he reminds me of Declan Rice. He is only 18 on paper but his head and mind is like he\u2019s 25 or 27. He\u2019s a kid in a positive way in that he is not afraid to play. \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about being young because he is thinking positively. It\u2019s our job, and his family\u2019s, to keep him humble and then there is no doubt that he has an extremely bright future and great career in front of him.\u201d West Brom came into the lunchtime clash having conceded first in their previous six Championship matches while QPR arrived on a run of four straight wins \u2013 and with two of the league\u2019s top scorers in Nahki Wells and Jordan Hugill. But Bilic\u2019s decision to bring Grady Diangana back into his starting lineup after the on-loan West Ham midfielder inspired West Brom to a comeback win at home to Huddersfield last weekend paid off handsomely. Diangana was heavily involved in West Brom\u2019s attacking play, teeing up Charlie Austin with a cross from the left that the striker took first time but saw well blocked in the fifth minute, before forcing a save from Lumley late on. Jake Livermore also tested the QPR goalkeeper with a shot from an acute angle as the game ended with West Brom keeping their first clean sheet of the season and having seven shots on target to the hosts\u2019 zero. \u201cToday they [QPR] were second best,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cNot because they are bad because we were very, very good.\u201d QPR spent most of the game on the back foot but did see Wells, who has scored five league goals this season, contrive to blaze an effort well over the bar from 25 yards out in the first half before Ilias Chair shrugged off two West Brom defenders but saw his cut-back into the box frantically cleared by the visitors. Things then went from bad to worse when Barbet was dismissed for a challenge on substitute Robson-Kanu which Mark Warburton felt was not deserved. \u201cI thought it was harsh. I felt as though it was a tangle of bodies. But I haven\u2019t seen it [the replay] yet. If there was a tangle, then it\u2019s 50-50,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just lost at home and missed the chance to go top of the table so I\u2019m disappointed. We showed too much respect. They are a very talented team. We knew what we were facing. We conceded a really soft goal, and if you concede a goal like that the whole game changes.\u201d",

Liverpool had an off-day and I feel we\u2019ve missed an opportunity to get a big result today. The shape of the team was good, it was never going to be a game of basketball. Their chances came from our mistakes. We\u2019ve had big moments. When Liverpool are off, we\u2019ve got to jump all over it. Norwich did it to Man City, they jumped on it. Clinical, three shots, three goals. We\u2019ve had enough to get something from this game.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8f61688f081108db9be731\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T13:40:05.766Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jurgen Klopp\u2019s verdict.</strong> \u201cWe had unbelievably big chances. We scored from a situation that was obviously unlucky for Sheffield United, that\u2019s clear. The goalie played an incredible game, but he was involved in that situation. If you win a lot of games, they are not all beauties, and we had to work really hard for that. We could have done better, but you have to respect the opponent, and they defend in a way that is really difficult. We didn\u2019t take risks because they were always there, it was really impressive. All respect for Sheffield United, it is a tough place to come. If it was 0-0 we could not moan.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8f5ebf8f08fbb0c171d28e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T13:31:34.760Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cWe have to give them credit. They played in a good way with a clear plan. It was a great atmosphere, and they made it tough for us.\u201d </strong>Virgil van Dijk\u2019s post-match analysis, there. It was a strange game. Sheffield United were superb, knocking Liverpool out of their rhythm, a rare mistake from Dean Henderson the only difference between a newly promoted team and the European champions. A draw wouldn\u2019t have flattered them. And yet Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah both blew glorious one-on-one chances, while Mane also hit the post. So Liverpool can also legitimately argue that they were ultimately worth their win on the balance of play, even if it took a large slice of luck to happen. Anyway, they\u2019re now top with 21 points, eight clear of Manchester City, who play Everton later this evening. Meanwhile Sheffield United stay in tenth spot for now, on eight points, and can console themselves with the fact that there is surely no way they\u2019ll be going down. They\u2019re simply too good.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8f5e658f084ab84172ee1b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T13:22:52.421Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Sheffield United 0-1 Liverpool</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And that\u2019s it.

By contrast, the Blades have lost their last two league matches at Bramall Lane. This afternoon presents a fine chance to snap that run.</p> <p><strong>Against the 100 percent league leaders and reigning champions of Europe?</strong> OK, if you put it like that, it\u2019s going to be a heck of a test for Chris Wilder\u2019s newly promoted side. But history has to count for something, and Liverpool haven\u2019t won at Bramall Lane since the opening day of the 1990-91 season, when second-half goals from John Barnes, Ray Houghton and Ian Rush secured a 3-1 victory. (For the completist: Brian Deane scored for Dave Bassett\u2019s side.) It\u2019s a six-game undefeated run for United, who have a 50 percent win rate over the stretch.</p> <p><strong>History only counts for so much, of course. </strong>And the current Liverpool have been clinical on their travels in the league, seeing off Southampton, Burnley and Chelsea without <em>too</em> much trouble. They\u2019ll be desperate to make it seven wins from seven and move eight points clear of champions Manchester City, at least for a couple of hours. But then the hosts will be desperate themselves. Not necessarily for points in a match that qualifies as a free hit - they\u2019re comfortable in mid-table right now - but for a statement result that would send a few reverberations up and down the Premier League table. All set up nicely, then. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T10:20:41.956Z\">at 11.20am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Louise Taylor\u2019s report has landed. And here it is! Enjoy, enjoy. Thanks for reading this MBM; hope to see you later for the Everton v Manchester City match. In the meantime, Rob Smyth is Mr Clockwatch, covering the 3pm kick-offs. He\u2019ll miss you dreadfully if you don\u2019t say hello. And now Chris Wilder gives his take. Was he proud of his team? \u201cI\u2019m not bothered about the pride bit, I\u2019m bothered about the result. We need to pick points up! Liverpool had an off-day and I feel we\u2019ve missed an opportunity to get a big result today. The shape of the team was good, it was never going to be a game of basketball. Their chances came from our mistakes. We\u2019ve had big moments. When Liverpool are off, we\u2019ve got to jump all over it. Norwich did it to Man City, they jumped on it. Clinical, three shots, three goals. We\u2019ve had enough to get something from this game.\u201d Jurgen Klopp\u2019s verdict. \u201cWe had unbelievably big chances. We scored from a situation that was obviously unlucky for Sheffield United, that\u2019s clear. The goalie played an incredible game, but he was involved in that situation. If you win a lot of games, they are not all beauties, and we had to work really hard for that. We could have done better, but you have to respect the opponent, and they defend in a way that is really difficult. We didn\u2019t take risks because they were always there, it was really impressive. All respect for Sheffield United, it is a tough place to come. If it was 0-0 we could not moan.\u201d \u201cWe have to give them credit. They played in a good way with a clear plan. It was a great atmosphere, and they made it tough for us.\u201d Virgil van Dijk\u2019s post-match analysis, there. It was a strange game. Sheffield United were superb, knocking Liverpool out of their rhythm, a rare mistake from Dean Henderson the only difference between a newly promoted team and the European champions. A draw wouldn\u2019t have flattered them. And yet Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah both blew glorious one-on-one chances, while Mane also hit the post. So Liverpool can also legitimately argue that they were ultimately worth their win on the balance of play, even if it took a large slice of luck to happen. Anyway, they\u2019re now top with 21 points, eight clear of Manchester City, who play Everton later this evening. Meanwhile Sheffield United stay in tenth spot for now, on eight points, and can console themselves with the fact that there is surely no way they\u2019ll be going down. They\u2019re simply too good. And that\u2019s it. Dean Henderson\u2019s error has gifted Liverpool a precious victory. Liverpool go eight points clear at the top, at least for a couple of hours, and maintain their 100 percent record. Sheffield United were magnificent, though. 90 min +4: Oxlade-Chamberlain replaces Mane. 90 min +3: The busy Fleck hooks high into the Liverpool box from the left. Adrian claims under intense pressure from McBurnie. Then the striker blocks Alexander-Arnold\u2019s clearance, the ball pinging out for a goal kick. He\u2019s been excellent as well. Just about everyone in a Sheffield United shirt has. 90 min +2: Liverpool are sitting deep. They\u2019re paying Sheffield United the highest respect. 90 min +1: Mane dribbles slowly down the left, and purchases a cheap free kick from Baldock. The crowd aren\u2019t happy about that at all. 90 min: There will be a minimum of four added minutes. 89 min: Salah dances in from the right and makes just enough space for a shot on the edge of the box. But O\u2019Connell blocks well, the second it leaves his boot. 88 min: Origi twists down the left, cuts inside and slams a low shot into the side netting. He\u2019s done well since coming on. 87 min: Milner comes on for Firmino, who has been poor by his lofty standards. 86 min: Ah, Clarke would probably have been given offside by VAR. He was about an inch ahead of Robertson before the pass was played. But it\u2019s a moot point seeing he missed, and in any case, to hell with VAR. 85 min: United should be level. Some space for Fleck out on the left touchline. He fires a low diagonal pass towards Clarke, who gets in between Robertson and Adrian ... but leans back and from six yards balloons over! 84 min: Liverpool still aren\u2019t on it at all. Fabinho has an opportunity to send Alexander-Arnold into acres of space down the right, but seriously overhits the pass. Throw to United. 83 min: Shades of Stamford Bridge, as Adrian is booked for taking his own sweet time over a goal kick. Liverpool nearly came a cropper against Chelsea with these cynical tactics; they\u2019d better watch themselves here. 82 min: And then suddenly Liverpool are on the break again! But with Salah about to rip into the United half, with team-mates in support, Stevens gets in the road, spots a heavy touch, and nips the ball away with a cute turn. He\u2019s been sensational today. 81 min: Now it\u2019s United\u2019s turn to win a corner, out on the left, thanks to the presence of the irrepressible McBurnie. Origi whacks it clear. 79 min: Nothing comes of the corner. For all their poor play, Liverpool have still had three gilt-edged chances to put this game way out of Sheffield United\u2019s reach. But it\u2019s still in the balance. A big ten minutes in the title race coming up! 78 min: Redemption for Henderson! Salah is sent clear after Lundstram misplaces a pass. He\u2019s got to score ... but slaps his shot straight at the keeper, who stands firm and deflects the ball out for a corner! A dreadful miss, but a wonderful save. What moxie the keeper showed there, after the horror of the goal. 77 min: United send on the cavalry ... in the shape of Leon Clarke, who is making his Premier League debut at the age of 34. He replaces Norwood. 76 min: Corner for Liverpool down the left. It\u2019s fired into the mixer, but blasted clear by McBurnie. Bramall Lane is still to recover from the blow of that goal. A pensive mood. But there\u2019s still plenty of time. 74 min: Poor Henderson. He was already thinking about collecting that shot in his arms and redistributing it. A fatal lack of concentration. The blood drains from the young man\u2019s face, as he shakes his head sadly. 72 min: Poor Henderson, who holds his head in both hands. Salah, perhaps sniffing blood, tests him with another long-range shot. Henderson holds on this time. Oh dear. Sheffield United have been excellent this afternoon, but they\u2019ve just been undone by a dreadful mistake from Henderson in goal. Origi works away on the left wing. The ball drops to Wijnaldum, just to the right of the D. He volleys straight at Henderson, who should gather ... but lets the ball squeak through his legs. It rolls apologetically over the line. Oh my. 69 min: Mousset fouls Wijnaldum, 30 yards out. A free kick. But it only leads to McBurnie tearing clear down the left. Alexander-Arnold does extremely well to get back and put a stop to his gallop. 67 min: United ping the ball in pretty triangles down the left. Suddenly Fleck is clear! He enters the area, drops a shoulder to see off a challenge from Fabinho, prepares to shoot and ... has his effort blocked by Robertson, arriving from nowhere! Then the ball drops to Lundstram, on the penalty spot, and his shot is stopped by Van Dijk! So close to breaking the deadlock. 65 min: The corner\u2019s a bit of a non-event. But the home fans continue to give it plenty. They sense there\u2019s something in this for their heroes. 64 min: Origi\u2019s in the thick of the action immediately, tearing down the left and cutting back for Salah, who takes a fresh-air kick. United go straight up the other end, Norwood sending a daisycutter towards the bottom left. Adrian is forced to tip around the post. 63 min: O\u2019Connell is booked for kicking the ball away. Meanwhile Liverpool make their first change, hooking Henderson and sending on Divock Origi. 62 min: Liverpool ping it around the middle, but United are snapping at their heels. No space in which to work. The ball ends up back with Van Dijk. The home side are all over this right now. 60 min: The free kick\u2019s eventually taken. Henderson shifts it to Alexander-Arnold, who blooters wild and high into the stand under pressure from Robinson. It\u2019s Robinson\u2019s last act of the afternoon; he\u2019s replaced by Lys Mousset, who did for Everton last weekend. Can he make it a Merseyside double? 58 min: Salah twists and turns down the inside-right channel and is shoved over by Basham. Free kick, just outside the box. Ah, but there\u2019s been another foul just before, a tug on Wijnaldum\u2019s shirt, so the set piece will be taken a good 30 yards out. Henderson and Alexander-Arnold have a very long debate about what to do. 56 min: Lundstram and Mane come together in the United box, the former sliding near the latter. There\u2019s a little contact, and Lundstram doesn\u2019t get the ball. Mane goes down but doesn\u2019t really claim. Neither referee nor VAR is interested. 54 min: Robertson and Alexander-Arnold are patrolling their regular beats again. Liverpool\u2019s search to crack the United code goes on. 53 min: The corner finds McBurnie, six yards out. His header flies over. The ball takes a little nick off Fabinho, but United don\u2019t get this decision. One each, then, in that respect. 52 min: Before the set piece can be taken, Henderson needs some treatment, as he\u2019s just clattered into Matip. He\u2019s up and about quickly enough, but won\u2019t be around to help defend the corner. 51 min: Fleck and Robinson combine well down the left and earn a throw deep in Liverpool territory. From the throw, Fleck drives a low cross into the box, hoping to find Robinson in the middle. Van Dijk is forced to hook clear for another throw. He wants an offside flag, and he should see one, but United get away with it. From the next throw, the hosts force a corner. 49 min: Alexander-Arnold and Robertson have switched flanks. Liverpool searching for a fresh idea. 47 min: The corner comes to nothing. \u201cCan I suggest that Klopp doesn\u2019t know a great deal about serial killers if he thinks the are shouty?\u201d writes Andy Tuohy. \u201cMost, if not all, tend to be pretty calm and premeditated. I\u2019ve been watching \u2018Mindhunter\u2019 so I\u2019m a bit of and expert now.\u201d I\u2019m not 100 percent sure we should go too much further with this line of patter. 46 min: Liverpool are immediately on the attack. Salah makes a nuisance of himself and the ball drops to Fabinho, whose low-flying volley is blocked well. United go up the other end, Fleck nearly burning Van Dijk for pace down the left. But the defender refuses to budge and blocks the ball out for a corner. A bright start to the half, this! Sheffield United get the second half underway! Neither manager has made a change at the break. Half-time analysis, courtesy of Gary Naylor. \u201cI was amazed last week at Goodison by Sheffield United\u2019s clarity of conception and discipline of execution - and it looks like they\u2019re doing another number today. Ironically, it\u2019s only the lack of a cutting edge that stops the Blades becoming real top-half contenders.\u201d The half-time whistle goes. A fine 45 minutes for United, who have asked Liverpool some serious questions. They\u2019ve been magnificent. The league leaders by contrast will no doubt be on the end of a severe talking-to at half-time ... and yet despite it all, Sadio Mane really should have two goals to his name. Funny old game, as a wise man once said. It promises to be a belter of a second half! 45 min: And now it\u2019s United\u2019s turn to go close! Robinson crosses deep from the left. Lundstram rises highest at the far post, heading across goal. McBurnie rises, forcing Matip to head over his own crossbar. The corner comes to nothing. 43 min: What an escape for United! Liverpool break quickly and are three on one, with only Basham between their famous front line and goal. Firmino, in a central position, tees up Mane to his left. Mane has to score - again - but batters his low shot against the left-hand post! The ball\u2019s bundled out for a corner, and nothing comes from the set piece. And so Liverpool still haven\u2019t had a shot on target! 42 min: Baldock crosses low from the right. Basham tries a fancy backheel but misses. McBurnie has a swing but can only send the ball out for a goal kick, miles wide right of the target. He wants a corner off Van Dijk, but he\u2019s not getting one. He\u2019s furious. 40 min: Norwood gifts Robertson the ball in the midfield. Robertson tries to release Mane down the left but overhits the pass. Goal kick. This is pretty scrappy right now. 38 min: Wijnaldum takes up possession, just to the left of the United D, and curls a shot into the top corner of ... the stand behind the goal. Liverpool still haven\u2019t got a shot on target. Very poor. 37 min: Stevens crosses deep from the left. Robinson wins an aerial battle with Matip, six yards out, but mistimes his header, the ball skimming off the top of his neep and out for a goal kick. 36 min: Salah wins a footrace with O\u2019Connell down the inside right, spins and pulls the ball back for Alexander-Arnold, who crosses for Robertson. The resulting shot, across the face of the United goal, flies wide right. Still not great, but at least better from Liverpool. 34 min: Liverpool finally carve out a chance ... and it was so simple. Van Dijk creams a long pass down the middle, a huge gap in the United defence. Mane is clear! He\u2019s got to score, but severely shanks his shot from just inside the box, the ball harmlessly squirting wide right. What a chance gone begging! Henderson still hasn\u2019t been forced to make a save. 32 min: The rain has stopped. Sun streams across Bramall Lane. One of those lovely autumn days. 30 min: Henderson and O\u2019Connell run into each other. Henderson falls over then springs up with a face on. They have a brief exchange of views. Then Salah goes over, fouled by Stevens, and Fleck follows up with an accidental toe-poke to his opponent\u2019s arm. Salah winces in pain, he\u2019s not happy either. The temperature has suddenly gone up a notch or two. 28 min: United are right on top of their game here. Lundstram has a lash from the right of the Liverpool D. Robertson is forced into a dramatic sliding block. The crowd turn it up another notch; they sense there\u2019s something in this for the Blades! 26 min: Salah nicks the ball off Stevens and glides in from the right, curling a low shot across Henderson and out for a goal kick. It\u2019s the best Liverpool have managed so far. It wasn\u2019t much. 25 min: Alexander-Arnold hoicks a wild right-wing cross out of play for a goal kick. A sign that Liverpool are already getting a little bit frustrated at United\u2019s stubbornness? Perhaps; on the touchline, Klopp is screaming in the serial-killer (his words) style. 23 min: Slapstick stylings in the midfield, as Egan slips on the wet turf. Firmino looks to prod the ball past him; he\u2019d be free, albeit with half of the pitch still to cover. But Firmino\u2019s first touch hits the stricken Egan smack on the top of his noggin, an inadvertent block that stops Liverpool in their tracks. I\u2019d like to see the pair of them try that again. 21 min: Norwood splits the midfield with a pass through the middle for Fleck, who turns and slides the ball down the inside-right channel for Robinson. The striker reaches the edge of the box and rasps a shot across Adrian and well wide left. He should have done better, with Liverpool extremely light at the back. The hosts ripped the league leaders apart there. 19 min: Some quite sensational play from Stevens out on the left wing. He brings down a high ball, turns, and sashays his way past a couple of Liverpool challenges. His flick left, intended to release Robinson, doesn\u2019t come off, but that was a lovely run, and he gets the warm applause he deserves. 17 min: Van Dijk tries to win a header from the corner. No joy. Mane attempts an overhead kick, and the ball brushes McBurnie\u2019s arm, but the striker was standing right next to him and his arms were in a natural position. No movement. Liverpool make no claim. VAR doesn\u2019t have the brass neck to poke its neb in. We play on. 16 min: Liverpool get into the United area for the first time. A little bit of pinball ends with Wijnaldum taking a shot from the edge of the box. It\u2019s deflected wide right for Liverpool\u2019s first corner of the match. 15 min: Fabinho plays a cute first-time ball down the right to nearly release Salah. But Egan comes across quickly to block. A fine challenge, because for a second there, it looked as though Salah would get there first and tear clear on goal. 14 min: Liverpool have enjoyed had 76% of possession so far. They\u2019re struggling to do anything with it. Sheffield United are on point. 13 min: Norwood hits the corner long. Baldock meets it at the far post, but can only eyebrow harmlessly out for a goal kick. United are well up for this. 12 min: That very early flurry aside, Liverpool haven\u2019t got going yet. Alexander-Arnold sprays a right-to-left diagonal pass straight into touch. United fly straight up the other end, Stevens winning the first corner of the match out on the left. 10 min: A slack Alexander-Arnold pass in the midfield allows Robinson to tear upfield. He makes up for his mistake by heading clear when Baldock crosses from the right. This is a really impressive start by the newly promoted Blades. Liverpool don\u2019t look comfortable at all right now, and Jurgen Klopp is already up on the touchline, arms folded, brow furrowed. 8 min: Another long ball down the United left nearly releases McBurnie. Liverpool are leaving a lot of space wide open on this flank. McBurnie runs immediately into trouble this time, but he might get some joy here today. 7 min: United are knocking it around with confidence too, mind. O\u2019Connell showcases the home team\u2019s ambition by pressing Fabinho near Liverpool\u2019s left-hand corner flag. The visitors clear, but they had to work hard to do so. 5 min: The crowd going even more, that is. Plenty of bedlam here. An old-school football atmosphere is such a beautiful noise. Meanwhile Liverpool stroke it around the middle in the sterile style. 3 min: But it\u2019s United who get the first shot away! Stevens sends McBurnie away down the left. The big striker cuts inside, past Alexander-Arnold and Matip, and tries to curl one into the top right. It\u2019s straight at Adrian, who gets his hands warmed. That\u2019s got the crowd going! 2 min: Liverpool press and apply some early pressure. Henderson, Firmino, Mane, Alexander-Arnold and Robertson pinging it around nicely. But the hosts hold firm on the edge of their box. And we\u2019re off! The late-summer rain falling heavier now. The sun still shining through. Liverpool get the ball rolling as the home faithful belt out the Greasy Chip Butty song. Everyone giving it plenty. The teams are out! A banging atmosphere at a bulging Bramall Lane as the Blades and the European champions take to the field of play. The drizzle can\u2019t dampen it. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Chris Wilder talks! To his team, but not BT Sport. Work to do. Jurgen Klopp speaks, and he\u2019s very complimentary about his hosts. \u201cThey have had good results, they\u2019re playing good football, they\u2019re playing their football. It is important for teams to find a way and they have found it and it makes life uncomfortable. But when we are on our absolute top, it\u2019s difficult to find a team like us with desire and intensity. Most of our team has had a week off to prepare, so hopefully we will see that. It\u2019s a big one for Sheffield United, but it\u2019s a big one for us as well.\u201d Some breaking news this morning ... in case you missed it. Fair\u2019s fair, the kitman\u2019s tidied up. And got the bevvies in too. Chaotic scenes in the Liverpool dressing room. These pre-match glimpses into the inner sanctum usually showcase clubs at their professional best, crisp kits freshly laundered, neatly folded or hung, always presented to the highest standard. Is someone recovering from a big night out? Hey, we all have off days. Anyway, from this disorder we can deduce that Liverpool will be playing in third-choice black, hosts Sheffield United the redmen today. If It Ain\u2019t Broke dept. It\u2019s an unchanged side for Sheffield United, Chris Wilder naming the same XI that did for Everton last weekend. And it\u2019s an unchanged side for Liverpool, too. It\u2019s the same XI sent out at Stamford Bridge last Sunday. We\u2019ve ignored the midweek League Cup line-ups, but y\u2019know. Sheffield United: Henderson, Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell, Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens, McBurnie, Robinson. Subs: Luke Freeman, Jagielka, Mousset, Osborn, Clarke, Moore, Besic. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Lovren, Milner, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Origi, Kelleher. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Sheffield United\u2019s best work so far this season has been on the road. A commendable opening-day draw at Bournemouth; a magnificent two-goal comeback at Chelsea to salvage a draw; a win at Everton achieved easily, despite (according to their manager) not even playing that well. By contrast, the Blades have lost their last two league matches at Bramall Lane. This afternoon presents a fine chance to snap that run. Against the 100 percent league leaders and reigning champions of Europe? OK, if you put it like that, it\u2019s going to be a heck of a test for Chris Wilder\u2019s newly promoted side. But history has to count for something, and Liverpool haven\u2019t won at Bramall Lane since the opening day of the 1990-91 season, when second-half goals from John Barnes, Ray Houghton and Ian Rush secured a 3-1 victory. (For the completist: Brian Deane scored for Dave Bassett\u2019s side.) It\u2019s a six-game undefeated run for United, who have a 50 percent win rate over the stretch. History only counts for so much, of course. And the current Liverpool have been clinical on their travels in the league, seeing off Southampton, Burnley and Chelsea without too much trouble. They\u2019ll be desperate to make it seven wins from seven and move eight points clear of champions Manchester City, at least for a couple of hours. But then the hosts will be desperate themselves. Not necessarily for points in a match that qualifies as a free hit - they\u2019re comfortable in mid-table right now - but for a statement result that would send a few reverberations up and down the Premier League table. All set up nicely, then. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm BST.",

The World Cup hosts came from nine points down to win after playing with pace, skill and fervour that the humidity and time could not dim. Such was the thunderous roar when the final whistle sounded it would have caused the nearby Mount Fuji to wobble. There were times when they looked like the All Blacks in red and white jerseys, offloading, evading tackles and breaking from deep to make one of the tightest defences in world rugby scramble with increasing desperation. Japan stunned the rugby world four years ago when they defeated South Africa in Brighton, and they are now on course to meet the Springboks in the last eight, but this was different. The 1995 and 2007 winners were on the way down, bloated and complacent, but Ireland did not throw this match away.

They were unfortunate when Josh van der Flier\u2019s knock-on two metres from his line was not picked up, but they were becoming frustrated at their failure to reward pressure with points when Leitch came on to replace the injured Amanaki Mafi in the back row. He quickly touched the ball three times, driving hard and straight each time, sucking in defenders, making a few metres, getting to the gainline and putting his side on the front foot.

The teams meet in their final pool game, on 13 October. The crucial score on Saturday came on 58 minutes. Japan, gaining in confidence, attacked in waves, the timing of passes and runs by support players taking them into space \u2013 and when Ryoto Nakamura\u2019s break took his side into Ireland\u2019s 22, Timothy Lafaele\u2019s slick pass allowed the replacement Kenki Fukuoka the space to score in the left corner and give the hosts the lead for the first time. It demanded a response from Ireland and they played as they know best, driving hard, taking play through phases and waiting for a penalty to kick to touch. It came but Japan read the throw and stole the ball, and slowly but steadily the air went out of the men in green. Japan had been camera shy against Russia on the opening night, unused to the attention and uncomfortable in it, but here they revelled in the spotlight. Their lead was four points but they remained uninhibited, Matsushima leading a breakout from his own line before a scrum in the home 22 was the base for another counter. It was not just the humidity that was foreign to Ireland but the refusal of their opponents to stick with what they had. Tamura\u2019s third penalty nine minutes from the end, after Conor Murray had overstayed his welcome on the wrong side of a ruck, meant Ireland were playing for a draw but still Japan came at them, Fukuoka denied a second try after a 60-metre interception when he took the inside track rather than the outside and was hauled down by Keith Earls. It was Ireland, though, who were caught short. They had started strongly, Jack Carty twice using advantage after they were awarded a penalty in Japan\u2019s 22 to launch kicks that discomfited the defence and yielded tries for Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney. Ireland had a final chance with 12 seconds to go when Isileli Nakajima knocked on just short of the line. Joey Carbery opted to kick the ball dead and take the bonus point.",

The two men appeared together at the University of New England in Biddeford on Friday, to mark the 30th anniversary of a two-day education \u201csummit\u201d held by President George HW Bush in 1989. All but one state governor attended that meeting, Clinton representing Arkansas three years before he beat Bush for the White House. \u201cIt sounds surprising now,\u201d Clinton claimed of such bipartisan political action. \u201cIt was normal then.\u201d \u201cPresident Clinton and my dad set the example,\u201d said Bush, \u201cof how you can have a different view on things but be good friends. Public leaders can create aspiration.\u201d The two men are pillars of American political dynasties. Bush\u2019s brother, George W Bush, succeeded Clinton in the White House. Clinton\u2019s wife, former secretary of state and New York senator Hillary Clinton, lost the presidency to Donald Trump in 2016 despite winning the popular vote in an election which US intelligence agencies agree was subject to Russian interference designed to help the Republican. Clinton has been outspoken this week, as House Democrats have announced an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine and attempts to smear Joe Biden, the former vice-president who is a potential Democratic challenger in 2020. Speaking at Georgetown University in Washington on Friday, Hillary Clinton said Trump had \u201cturned American diplomacy into a cheap extortion racket\u201d and \u201cendangered us all by putting his personal and political interests ahead of the interests of the American people\u201d. In Maine, Trump and his travails were barely mentioned. Bill Clinton, who survived impeachment over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, did not discuss that or the current occupant of the Oval Office. Instead he saluted his presidential predecessor\u2019s work across the aisle and said he would \u201clove to see \u2019em do it again\u201d. \u201cDo you think President Trump would stay for a meeting for two days?\u201d said Bush. The audience laughed. Bush ran against Trump for the 2016 Republican nomination, beginning the primary as favourite but dropping out after being eviscerated by Trump in a brutal campaign marked by vicious personal attacks. \u201cAttribute that quote to the person who made it,\u201d Clinton said.",

      "body": "<p>A dark green tree stands on the north side of the medieval stone church in Defynnog. The tree is broader than it is tall and has divided into two quite separate trees over the centuries. Beneath its low boughs, multiple trunks resemble molten lava. Some limbs twist like sinews; others are ramrod straight. Some patches of wood are as smooth as liquid; other parts are as spiny as a sea urchin. There are stag\u2019s antlers of dead branches but also spiky fresh foliage that turns ancient stumps into enormous shaving brushes.</p> <p>All forms of tree seem to be present in this fantastical, sculptural yew in a small Welsh village in the Brecon Beacons. But the most extraordinary feature of this ancient tree is that it is less protected than the much younger church beside it. Now a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/save-britain-s-ancient-yew-trees-before-we-lose-any-more\">petition calling for legal protection for ancient yews</a> has gained 230,000 signatories. The trees\u2019 fate has been discussed by the ancients of the House of Lords and barristers are drawing up plans for new legislation.</p> <p>Britain is home to far more ancient yews than any other country in Europe. The <a href=\"https://www.ancient-yew.org/\">Ancient Yew Group</a> has identified 978 ancient or veteran yews (more than 500 years old) in England and 407 in Wales; France has 77; Germany and Spain just four each. But some tree champions claim that proposals to protect them will never become law because powerful landowners \u2013 and one landowner in particular \u2013 are opposed to extra protections.</p> <p>For Janis Fry, an artist and yew expert who started the petition, the yew at Defynnog possesses \u201cevery possibility of creation\u201d. Its red berries (the flesh \u2013 but not the poisonous seeds inside \u2013 is the only edible part of a notoriously toxic tree) show it is female but, unusually, this tree also has one male branch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5430787e27ea1e9c20fbbe272d338ab3b702ec0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5430787e27ea1e9c20fbbe272d338ab3b702ec0a/0_0_5100_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The yew tree in Fortingall, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The yew tree in Fortingall, Scotland.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Richardson/NGC/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is notoriously difficult to determine the age of an old yew, and extravagant claims about such trees abound, but several experts have put the Defynnog yew at more than 5,000 years old \u2013 as ancient, if not more so, as another churchyard yew at Fortingall, Scotland. Other authorities suggest it is a mere 1,500 years old but even if it isn\u2019t the oldest living thing in Europe, this unique tree currently has less legal protection than any of the estimated 530,000 listed buildings, including bus stops and skate parks, in England and Wales. If anyone damaged or destroyed the Defynnog yew, they could escape any legal punishment. Damage to the church at Defynnog, a Grade I-listed building of \u201cexceptional interest\u201d, could be punished with <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/uwandhc/offences/\">two years in prison</a> or an unlimited fine.</p> <p>The yew is cherished by its local vicar and parish but some visitors who come to worship it have stripped yellow-coloured needles from its unusual, small \u201cgolden boughs\u201d. Fry tuts as she points to them. \u201cThe pagans have been taking needles off it,\u201d she says \u2013 they believe these strangely-coloured needles possess healing powers.</p> <p>This is one small sign of the yew\u2019s cultural and religious heft. Many are found in churchyards, where their sacred status has protected them well for centuries. Many old yews were planted by Norman church-builders; others by Celtic Christians; and some predate Christianity, showing how the new religion supplanted older sacred sites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1fbb24e43213a215d7faca853868276b3fe80d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1fbb24e43213a215d7faca853868276b3fe80d5/0_328_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yew trees and door of St Edward\u2019s church, Stow-on the-Wold, Gloucestershire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yew trees and door of St Edward\u2019s church, Stow-on the-Wold, Gloucestershire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Black/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the tree of life, death and resurrection and it\u2019s known as the tree of life in all cultures across the northern hemisphere,\u201d says Fry. The chevron pattern of its needles is a motif in religions both ancient and modern; Fry is alive to the yew\u2019s spiritual symbolism but it took a friend of hers to point out that the badge of her car, a Citro\u00ebn, shares the yew\u2019s chevron symbol.</p> <p>The tree\u2019s mystical qualities are derived from its ability to regenerate, producing fresh shoots from apparently \u201cdead\u201d wood \u2013 such as the staffs of holy men or beams within buildings. Today, the species triggers fierce debate among ancient tree experts. Rings cannot be counted and carbon dating cannot be undertaken on most yews because their ancient hearts rot and disappear. Some dismiss estimates of 5,000 year-old trees as \u201cromantic\u201d, although most accept the verdict of international dendrologists who have dated certain British yews at 2,000 years old.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/19/biodiversity-touches-every-aspect-of-our-lives-so-why-has-its-loss-been-ignored\">Biodiversity touches every aspect of our lives \u2013\u00a0so why has its loss been ignored?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But even if the Defynnog tree has only witnessed two millennia, there is something slightly eerie about its enduring virility, with fecund fresh growth sprouting from what resembles dead wood at its heart.</p> <p>The yew can regenerate us too \u2013 the anti-cancer drug Taxol is derived from the bark of the Pacific yew \u2013 while the ancient trees are home to an as-yet unknown wealth of other life. According to entomologist Keith Alexander, yews are not thought to support many of the beetles and invertebrates that live on decaying wood (ancient oaks are ecosystems for a myriad of such species) but ancient yews have not yet been subject to much targeted entomological study. The trees\u2019 evergreen foliage provides abundant cover for birds and winter shelter for moths, barkflies and spiders. One spider associated with the yew is the nationally scarce <em>Hyptiotes paradoxus,</em> \u201can odd-looking thing with wonky eyes\u201d, says Alexander.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36b7d3f5e8edc26f312a32fb3ee09546aa075a69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36b7d3f5e8edc26f312a32fb3ee09546aa075a69/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A song thrush in a yew tree\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A song thrush in a yew tree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Chapman/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fry fell under the yew\u2019s spell when she moved to Wales in the early 1970s and began exploring her local area. Returning home at dusk one day, she passed a magical-looking pair of wrought iron gates, slightly ajar. She crept up a bramble-covered drive, poked her head through a hole in the hedge and, like Alice in Wonderland, \u201cfell in to this most amazing ancient tunnel of yews. It was like a great gothic cathedral. I just thought, \u2018This is the eighth wonder of the world.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Fry had stumbled upon the then-derelict gardens at Aberglasney, Carmarthenshire, which have since been restored. As she learned more about ancient yews, she became more amazed at their failure to be protected in law. According to Fry, documentary evidence suggests about 500 ancient yews have been destroyed in the last century. Most were destroyed before the 1980s but there are more recent losses. Fry cites the chopping down of an ancient yew in Penegoes, Wales.</p> <p>An ancient yew was also cut down on the boundary of Ashford Carbonell churchyard in Shropshire in 2011. And Fry says churchyard trees are often neglected. \u201cAt one time these trees were considered to be sacred. They were revered. What happens now is that they are used as repositories for rubbish. Ivy grows all over them and acts as a sail in the wind and breaks their branches,\u201d she says. Fry has found stowed in ancient yews the remains of an old oil tank, lawn mowers, bags of cement, breeze blocks and piles of grass cuttings.</p> <p>These smaller slights against ancient yews are revealed on a tour of the ancient yews of Shropshire with Rob McBride, a campaigner who scours the country identifying ancient trees. (The boot of his old Audi contains an axe, a tape measure for recording tree girths and numerous maps.) A magnificent yew in the churchyard at Uppington has a hollow inside containing a garden rake and lawnmower grass box. It has ivy growing up it, as do the ancient yews in Kenley churchyard.</p> <p>\u201cI love ivy but you\u2019ve got to value it against what it\u2019s growing on,\u201d says McBride, tearing the ivy off. At both locations, he points to stumps where branches have been cut. \u201cI wish they hadn\u2019t cut them. There is this mentality of tidiness and keeping nature in check.\u201d Cutting branches may prevent an old tree from stabilising itself and stop a yew from regenerating.</p> <p>Left alone, a yew\u2019s branches will touch the ground and take root, allowing the tree to very slowly stroll through the landscape. Although most church wardens are well-meaning, says McBride, there is no legal requirement for churches to call upon specialist ancient tree surgeons when trimming an old yew \u201cinstead of Fred down the road who has got a saw\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9378c6100f854e16fc78bcaeb2c4245c68565f04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9378c6100f854e16fc78bcaeb2c4245c68565f04/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ancient yew tree in the churchyard at Hope Bagot in Shropshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ancient yew tree in the churchyard at Hope Bagot in Shropshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MH Country/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McBride is astonished that there is no legal protection for ancient yews. \u201cIf I take a chisel to the church at Uppington, it would be a criminal offence. So how can people just cut bits off ancient yews?\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone was saying on social media, it\u2019s only three prime ministers until Christmas. That\u2019s part of the reason these trees haven\u2019t got protection \u2013 this country is very short-termist.\u201d</p> <p>He believes that moves to protect ancient trees have been quietly kiboshed by landowners who resist \u201cinterference\u201d with their land. \u201cInterference is what they hate, unless you\u2019re giving them money. They don\u2019t mind filling forms out for subsidies. I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re not getting proper protection.\u201d</p> <p>Fry is heartened by the success of her petition but believes any moves to translate it into government legislation are being scuppered by lobbying from the church. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got the largest collection of ancient yews in the world, why aren\u2019t they protected? It\u2019s because the church won\u2019t have it. The church has always considered such moves an unnecessary challenge to its authority and jurisdiction over its own property.\u201d</p> <p>The Church of England says it won\u2019t support a campaign for extra protection for yews because there is already adequate protection for ancient yew trees, which can be given \u201ctree protection orders\u201d, or TPOs, by the local authority. Yews are also protected if they are in a conservation area and the C of E\u2019s own law requires churches to seek permission to remove any churchyard trees. The C of E is wary of adding to the legislative burden its church managers already face. And it points to the vast majority of ancient yews being found in churchyards as proof that church folk have been excellent tree guardians over the ages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ea4335792ca231a7edd2d845bb78b8d20045976\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ea4335792ca231a7edd2d845bb78b8d20045976/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ancient yew in the churchyard of St John the Baptist in Shropshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ancient yew in the churchyard of St John the Baptist in Shropshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MH Country/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Its senior figures won\u2019t go on record for this story but David Shreeve, an environmental adviser to the Church of England, says the church\u2019s environment working group makes \u201cevery effort to protect the ancient trees in our churchyards. Many yew trees were in place before churches were even built \u2013 they are an important part of our national heritage.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Glanville of the Church in Wales strikes a more emollient note. \u201cClearly we want them celebrated and it\u2019s a really important thing that we happen to own. I\u2019d love them to have special acknowledgment and maybe special [legal] protection is a way of doing that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if things get designated something, is that actually going to improve things?\u201d</p> <p>Glanville admits that some churches have made \u201cill-informed\u201d decisions about cutting or trimming of churchyard yews in the past. The Church in Wales has introduced a new requirement for churches with ancient yews to seek advice from ancient tree specialists before undertaking any tree surgery; the church provides funding for that specialist advice. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure ancient yews are desperately under threat,\u201d says Glanville, \u201cbecause what\u2019s going to threaten them? It\u2019s going to be ill-informed work.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Powlesland, a barrister who founded Lawyers for Nature, believes \u201cthe church\u2019s heart is in the right place\u201d, but says the TPO system is \u201cnot brilliant protection\u201d for ancient trees. TPOs only tend to be granted by a local authority if a tree is threatened. A TPO is often too late, and too little.</p> <p>\u201cThe punishments [fines] for breaching a TPO are quite simply not reflective of the importance of these trees,\u201d argues Powlesland. \u201cIt\u2019s an anomaly in our law that we haven\u2019t grappled properly with the idea of protecting living things.

      "bodyText": "A dark green tree stands on the north side of the medieval stone church in Defynnog. The tree is broader than it is tall and has divided into two quite separate trees over the centuries. Beneath its low boughs, multiple trunks resemble molten lava. Some limbs twist like sinews; others are ramrod straight. Some patches of wood are as smooth as liquid; other parts are as spiny as a sea urchin. There are stag\u2019s antlers of dead branches but also spiky fresh foliage that turns ancient stumps into enormous shaving brushes. All forms of tree seem to be present in this fantastical, sculptural yew in a small Welsh village in the Brecon Beacons. But the most extraordinary feature of this ancient tree is that it is less protected than the much younger church beside it. Now a petition calling for legal protection for ancient yews has gained 230,000 signatories. The trees\u2019 fate has been discussed by the ancients of the House of Lords and barristers are drawing up plans for new legislation. Britain is home to far more ancient yews than any other country in Europe. The Ancient Yew Group has identified 978 ancient or veteran yews (more than 500 years old) in England and 407 in Wales; France has 77; Germany and Spain just four each. But some tree champions claim that proposals to protect them will never become law because powerful landowners \u2013 and one landowner in particular \u2013 are opposed to extra protections. For Janis Fry, an artist and yew expert who started the petition, the yew at Defynnog possesses \u201cevery possibility of creation\u201d. Its red berries (the flesh \u2013 but not the poisonous seeds inside \u2013 is the only edible part of a notoriously toxic tree) show it is female but, unusually, this tree also has one male branch. It is notoriously difficult to determine the age of an old yew, and extravagant claims about such trees abound, but several experts have put the Defynnog yew at more than 5,000 years old \u2013 as ancient, if not more so, as another churchyard yew at Fortingall, Scotland. Other authorities suggest it is a mere 1,500 years old but even if it isn\u2019t the oldest living thing in Europe, this unique tree currently has less legal protection than any of the estimated 530,000 listed buildings, including bus stops and skate parks, in England and Wales. If anyone damaged or destroyed the Defynnog yew, they could escape any legal punishment. Damage to the church at Defynnog, a Grade I-listed building of \u201cexceptional interest\u201d, could be punished with two years in prison or an unlimited fine. The yew is cherished by its local vicar and parish but some visitors who come to worship it have stripped yellow-coloured needles from its unusual, small \u201cgolden boughs\u201d. Fry tuts as she points to them. \u201cThe pagans have been taking needles off it,\u201d she says \u2013 they believe these strangely-coloured needles possess healing powers. This is one small sign of the yew\u2019s cultural and religious heft. Many are found in churchyards, where their sacred status has protected them well for centuries. Many old yews were planted by Norman church-builders; others by Celtic Christians; and some predate Christianity, showing how the new religion supplanted older sacred sites. \u201cIt\u2019s the tree of life, death and resurrection and it\u2019s known as the tree of life in all cultures across the northern hemisphere,\u201d says Fry. The chevron pattern of its needles is a motif in religions both ancient and modern; Fry is alive to the yew\u2019s spiritual symbolism but it took a friend of hers to point out that the badge of her car, a Citro\u00ebn, shares the yew\u2019s chevron symbol. The tree\u2019s mystical qualities are derived from its ability to regenerate, producing fresh shoots from apparently \u201cdead\u201d wood \u2013 such as the staffs of holy men or beams within buildings. Today, the species triggers fierce debate among ancient tree experts. Rings cannot be counted and carbon dating cannot be undertaken on most yews because their ancient hearts rot and disappear. Some dismiss estimates of 5,000 year-old trees as \u201cromantic\u201d, although most accept the verdict of international dendrologists who have dated certain British yews at 2,000 years old. But even if the Defynnog tree has only witnessed two millennia, there is something slightly eerie about its enduring virility, with fecund fresh growth sprouting from what resembles dead wood at its heart. The yew can regenerate us too \u2013 the anti-cancer drug Taxol is derived from the bark of the Pacific yew \u2013 while the ancient trees are home to an as-yet unknown wealth of other life. According to entomologist Keith Alexander, yews are not thought to support many of the beetles and invertebrates that live on decaying wood (ancient oaks are ecosystems for a myriad of such species) but ancient yews have not yet been subject to much targeted entomological study. The trees\u2019 evergreen foliage provides abundant cover for birds and winter shelter for moths, barkflies and spiders. One spider associated with the yew is the nationally scarce Hyptiotes paradoxus, \u201can odd-looking thing with wonky eyes\u201d, says Alexander. Fry fell under the yew\u2019s spell when she moved to Wales in the early 1970s and began exploring her local area. Returning home at dusk one day, she passed a magical-looking pair of wrought iron gates, slightly ajar. She crept up a bramble-covered drive, poked her head through a hole in the hedge and, like Alice in Wonderland, \u201cfell in to this most amazing ancient tunnel of yews. It was like a great gothic cathedral. I just thought, \u2018This is the eighth wonder of the world.\u2019\u201d Fry had stumbled upon the then-derelict gardens at Aberglasney, Carmarthenshire, which have since been restored. As she learned more about ancient yews, she became more amazed at their failure to be protected in law. According to Fry, documentary evidence suggests about 500 ancient yews have been destroyed in the last century. Most were destroyed before the 1980s but there are more recent losses. Fry cites the chopping down of an ancient yew in Penegoes, Wales. An ancient yew was also cut down on the boundary of Ashford Carbonell churchyard in Shropshire in 2011. And Fry says churchyard trees are often neglected. \u201cAt one time these trees were considered to be sacred. They were revered. What happens now is that they are used as repositories for rubbish. Ivy grows all over them and acts as a sail in the wind and breaks their branches,\u201d she says. Fry has found stowed in ancient yews the remains of an old oil tank, lawn mowers, bags of cement, breeze blocks and piles of grass cuttings. These smaller slights against ancient yews are revealed on a tour of the ancient yews of Shropshire with Rob McBride, a campaigner who scours the country identifying ancient trees. (The boot of his old Audi contains an axe, a tape measure for recording tree girths and numerous maps.) A magnificent yew in the churchyard at Uppington has a hollow inside containing a garden rake and lawnmower grass box. It has ivy growing up it, as do the ancient yews in Kenley churchyard. \u201cI love ivy but you\u2019ve got to value it against what it\u2019s growing on,\u201d says McBride, tearing the ivy off. At both locations, he points to stumps where branches have been cut. \u201cI wish they hadn\u2019t cut them. There is this mentality of tidiness and keeping nature in check.\u201d Cutting branches may prevent an old tree from stabilising itself and stop a yew from regenerating. Left alone, a yew\u2019s branches will touch the ground and take root, allowing the tree to very slowly stroll through the landscape. Although most church wardens are well-meaning, says McBride, there is no legal requirement for churches to call upon specialist ancient tree surgeons when trimming an old yew \u201cinstead of Fred down the road who has got a saw\u201d. McBride is astonished that there is no legal protection for ancient yews. \u201cIf I take a chisel to the church at Uppington, it would be a criminal offence. So how can people just cut bits off ancient yews?\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone was saying on social media, it\u2019s only three prime ministers until Christmas. That\u2019s part of the reason these trees haven\u2019t got protection \u2013 this country is very short-termist.\u201d He believes that moves to protect ancient trees have been quietly kiboshed by landowners who resist \u201cinterference\u201d with their land. \u201cInterference is what they hate, unless you\u2019re giving them money. They don\u2019t mind filling forms out for subsidies. I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re not getting proper protection.\u201d Fry is heartened by the success of her petition but believes any moves to translate it into government legislation are being scuppered by lobbying from the church. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got the largest collection of ancient yews in the world, why aren\u2019t they protected? It\u2019s because the church won\u2019t have it. The church has always considered such moves an unnecessary challenge to its authority and jurisdiction over its own property.\u201d The Church of England says it won\u2019t support a campaign for extra protection for yews because there is already adequate protection for ancient yew trees, which can be given \u201ctree protection orders\u201d, or TPOs, by the local authority. Yews are also protected if they are in a conservation area and the C of E\u2019s own law requires churches to seek permission to remove any churchyard trees. The C of E is wary of adding to the legislative burden its church managers already face. And it points to the vast majority of ancient yews being found in churchyards as proof that church folk have been excellent tree guardians over the ages. Its senior figures won\u2019t go on record for this story but David Shreeve, an environmental adviser to the Church of England, says the church\u2019s environment working group makes \u201cevery effort to protect the ancient trees in our churchyards. Many yew trees were in place before churches were even built \u2013 they are an important part of our national heritage.\u201d Alex Glanville of the Church in Wales strikes a more emollient note. \u201cClearly we want them celebrated and it\u2019s a really important thing that we happen to own. I\u2019d love them to have special acknowledgment and maybe special [legal] protection is a way of doing that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if things get designated something, is that actually going to improve things?\u201d Glanville admits that some churches have made \u201cill-informed\u201d decisions about cutting or trimming of churchyard yews in the past. The Church in Wales has introduced a new requirement for churches with ancient yews to seek advice from ancient tree specialists before undertaking any tree surgery; the church provides funding for that specialist advice. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure ancient yews are desperately under threat,\u201d says Glanville, \u201cbecause what\u2019s going to threaten them? It\u2019s going to be ill-informed work.\u201d Paul Powlesland, a barrister who founded Lawyers for Nature, believes \u201cthe church\u2019s heart is in the right place\u201d, but says the TPO system is \u201cnot brilliant protection\u201d for ancient trees. TPOs only tend to be granted by a local authority if a tree is threatened. A TPO is often too late, and too little. \u201cThe punishments [fines] for breaching a TPO are quite simply not reflective of the importance of these trees,\u201d argues Powlesland. \u201cIt\u2019s an anomaly in our law that we haven\u2019t grappled properly with the idea of protecting living things. If an ancient oak was chopped down in 1700 and turned into a building, that oak in the building would now be protected. If it carried on growing, it wouldn\u2019t be protected.\u201d Not every ancient tree expert is calling for legislative protection. Through her work with the Woodland Trust and the Ancient Tree Forum, Jill Butler says there could be a \u201ctrees of national interest\u201d register with landowners informed of their importance. \u201cWe need something that is the lightest possible touch,\u201d she says. There needs to be \u201cfunding support\u201d for ancient tree owners, just as owners of precious wildflower meadows can obtain money for their management via agri-environment schemes. \u201cThe church has come a long way in the last 10 years or so,\u201d says Butler. \u201cBut the poor old church ought to be eligible for funding to help these trees as well. It\u2019s not just about control, it\u2019s about getting the right advice in how to look after them.\u201d Fry fears that many ancient yews will outlive the church. Churches are being closed.

      "bodyText": "Large numbers of police were on the streets of Hong Kong on Saturday night as officers conducted stop and searches on public transit lines and questioned residents wearing black, the colour adopted by protesters, after a mass rally dispersed to mark the fifth anniversary of the pro-democracy \u201cumbrella movement\u201d. Protesters changed into civilian clothes in alleys and behind walls of umbrellas in districts close to government headquarters, where earlier police fired a water cannon filled with dye and abrasive liquid from behind defensive barriers. Officers in defensive clothing filled Harcourt Road and a highway overpass in front of the government complex hundreds of metres deep as protesters on the frontlines threw rocks at windows and over police barriers. Before the water cannon was fired, a small band of masked protesters lit a flag of the Chinese Communist party on fire, shouting \u201cfuck Communists\u201d and \u201cfight for freedom!\u201d to cheers from nearby crowds. The gathering, however, lasted less than two hours as tactical police arrived on the scene, forcing protesters to flee over road barriers to avoid arrest before larger demonstrations planned for the rest of the week. Some said they would head to Mong Kok police station on the Kowloon peninsula, where protesters have regularly gathered in small numbers to shine lasers and shout at police. Major demonstrations, however, appeared to be over for the night as protesters disappeared into the winding side streets of the historic Central and Sheung Wan districts even as two subway stations on Hong Kong island were closed. Earlier, thousands of peaceful protesters filled Tamar Park on the other side of the government complex to remember the umbrella movement that paralysed Hong Kong for 79 days in 2014, forming the basis for the current protest movement that has roiled the city for the past four months. Before the police-sanctioned rally began in Tamar Park, next to the government buildings, officers raised a red warning flag and fired pepper spray on protesters, who were shining lasers and banging on the gates of the central government building. Protesters dispersed and occupied an adjacent major road. The police said \u201cviolent protesters\u201d had damaged property and aimed laser beams at a helicopter, \u201cposing a serious threat to the safety of everyone at the scene\u201d. Later, police used teargas and a water cannon, which sprayed pepper-laced blue dye over protesters who had been throwing rocks over the barrier, shattering windows on the lower level of the government headquarters. They also threw petrol bombs at police. Hong Kong was braced for consecutive days of protests and probable clashes, culminating with anti-government demonstrations on Tuesday to coincide with China\u2019s National Day, a politically important anniversary marking 70 years since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Hong Kong\u2019s legislature put out a \u201cred alert\u201d, evacuating staff and politicians from the legislative complex, which protesters have previously broken into. Dozens of riot police vans were parked nearby, and water barriers protected the government building. Protesters clad in black, with gas masks and helmets, were also preparing for clashes. \u201cThe Hong Kong police are attacking our protesters and the force is unnecessary,\u201d said a 22-year-old man, who planned to be on the frontline of protests to try to protect other demonstrators. He asked not to give his name for fear of arrest. \u201cWhat we really want is not to fight with police; all we want is to protect the people who are peaceful so they can safely leave,\u201d he said. Earlier on Saturday, protesters hung banners and plastered posters outside the complex, building a \u201cLennon wall,\u201d named after the John Lennon Wall in Prague, for political graffiti and messages. A group of masked musicians and singers performed the song Glory to Hong Kong, which has become the protesters\u2019 anthem. The Lennon wall stretched around the government complex, where it was originally started in 2014. Demonstrators hung large banners in yellow, the colour of the Umbrella movement, with the words: \u201cWe are back.\u201d The protests, which began in June over an extradition bill, have now lasted longer than the Umbrella movement and have expanded both in scope and tactics. The mostly non-violent 2014 protests were concentrated on a major road outside the government buildings. The recent demonstrations have sprung up across the city under the mantra \u201cBe water\u201d \u2013 a quote from the actor Bruce Lee. The protesters\u2019 demands echo those in 2014 \u2013 the implementation of genuine universal suffrage \u2013 but have also demanded an independent inquiry into police behaviour and reforms to the police force, which has lost considerable public trust. The protests have often turned violent, with police firing thousands of rounds of teargas and pepper spray on protesters, as well as deploying water cannon. Protesters have also increasingly been physically attacking critics and people they accuse of being \u201cmainland spies\u201d. As thousands rallied on Friday against the government\u2019s use of a controversial holding centre, a woman was kicked, punched and spray-painted for tearing down posters. Other protesters tried to protect the woman and treat a head wound as the attack continued. \u201cThese people started beating me up for no reason,\u201d she said, declining to give her name. She acknowledged she had torn down the protesters\u2019 posters but criticised them for not allowing her to express her views. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that people with different political views should be beaten up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you encourage democracy, freedom of speech, this is not the way that people should do [it].\u201d Despite the violence, the protesters maintain broad public support. \u201cIf I were 50 years younger, I would be out there at the front with them,\u201d said Ng Yin Fai, 72, who has been joining the protests since June. \u201cIf we don\u2019t protest today, we won\u2019t have this chance again.\u201d On Saturday a US academic who testified in a congressional hearing alongside democracy activists last week was denied entry to Hong Kong. Dan Garrett said officials told him he could not enter because of \u201cunspecified immigration reasons\u201d. A government spokesman, responding to protesters\u2019 calls for universal suffrage, said \u201cone man, one vote\u201dwas the ultimate goal, as enshrined in Hong Kong\u2019s constitution. \u201cTo achieve this aim, the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides,\u201d the government said in a statement. Residents said that while they were scared of potential arrest or violence from the police, they would continue to protest. \u201cSome of us may feel scared deep inside when we see the police. We feel scared by being simply young or just wearing black,\u201d said Yen, a secretary in her 30s, as she glued black paper stars with the words \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d on to a pavement. She said China\u2019s influence over Hong Kong had grown since the Umbrella movement ended, with the press and freedom of expression being stifled and pro-democracy activists being charged and jailed. \u201cJust being frightened is not an excuse for us, because we have no way back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to our normal state where China is taking over.\u201d Additional reporting by Laurel Chor",

The moniker chosen by the man born Kwadwo Adu Genfi Amponsah gives him a lot to live up to, but fortunately this emerging London rapper, currently winding up a sold-out UK tour, is a one-off in many ways. Few of today\u2019s crop of UK wordsmiths started their creative lives at the London College of Fashion studying drawing, but Radical did: he got a first. He recently designed bottles for some high-end tequila brand whose previous visuals have incorporated work by Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Tonight, Radical is wearing a fashion-forward black bin liner on the top half of his body. \u201cBeneath the torso\u201d (to borrow one of Radical\u2019s lyrics), he sports cargo trousers that don\u2019t go the distance. They split open at the crotch just a couple of songs into this action-packed, emotional gig. He owns up to the wardrobe malfunction and strips off next to the monitor sound desk, joking about costume changes. Radical is unusual in other ways, too. Before he was a visual artist he was a physical one, having trained as a dancer from the ages of 10 to 19. Although his commitment to discussing race, love, mental health and existential struggles in novel ways have elicited comparisons to US rapper Kendrick Lamar, there is usually a physical component to how Radical presents his music that is just as lyrical as the words \u2013 one that throws up parallels to FKA twigs, a fellow dancer-turned\u2011leftfield vocalist whose body sings the songs as much as her vocal cords. He dances \u2013 in part, as a way of metabolising depression and anxiety \u2013 and talks about dance, a lot. \u201cYeah, keep dancing,\u201d intoned Michaela Coel \u2013 of Chewing Gum fame \u2013 on Super Human, a key, moving track off Radical\u2019s previous EP, 2017\u2019s In Gods Body. On that track, it seemed like dancing possibly cut both ways for Radical: as one of the aspects of the black experience that white society finds aesthetically laudable, and as a practice in which succour or a state of grace could genuinely be found. Or, as Radical puts it tonight, while having a breather: \u201cI like to dance, man! Life is short and people suck\u2026\u201d He catches himself: \u201capart from the people in this room!\u201d Whether he is charging about furiously during the set\u2019s hyper-masculine grime phase, or unleashing nimble retro-funk micro-gestures later on, Radical moves like mercury: fluidly, with a shimmer. For 2020, one of the night\u2019s peaks, he kicks off his shoes and springs to the top of a speaker stack, commanding the moshpit to swirl harder.

According to one survey, conducted by the trusty academic journal Cosmopolitan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/12/is-it-ok-to-fake-orgasm-spare-partners-feelings\">67% of women</a> have pretended to climax.</p> <p>There are lots of obvious reasons why women faux-gasm \u2013 they don\u2019t want to hurt their partners feelings, for example, or they\u2019re just tired and want to go to sleep. However, according to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502071\">study just published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior</a> another big factor is feeling squeamish about using the C-word. Researchers found that women who \u201cstrongly agreed that they find it easy to use words like \u2018clitoris\u2019 to talk about sex were less likely to fake orgasms than those who strongly disagree\u201d. The study concluded that gender norms and \u201csexual double standards continue to limit female sexual expression, inhibiting some women\u2019s sexual communication and in particular their comfort level in receiving or asking for sexual pleasure\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not exactly new news that there is a sexual double standard. However this study is a jarring reminder of just how much shame is still attached to female desire, and how many women have internalized that shame. \u201cClitoris\u201d shouldn\u2019t be a dirty word and yet people still tiptoe around it as if the mere mention of something that exists purely for female pleasure is obscene.</p> <p>Society\u2019s fear of the clitoris has ramifications far beyond the bedroom. Earlier this year, for example, the UK had its first conviction for female genital mutilation. Writing in the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/clitoris-gift-ingrained-fear-fgm-tackle-outdated-mysogynistic-views-sex\">Lucy McCormick noted</a> that \u201cone of the things that stands out from the news reports of that case is how oddly furtive they were about communicating the key facts,\u201d in particular their avoidance of the word clitoris. As McCormick noted: \u201cYoung girls around the world are suffering horrendous mutilation because of a deep-rooted cultural fear of female pleasure, and the same fear is preventing us from even articulating the problem.\u201d</p> <p>So let\u2019s stop being so afraid of the clitoris shall we? That was obviously a rhetorical question; the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes.</p> <h2>Trump administration argues abortion isn\u2019t a human right</h2> <p>The war on abortion and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/opinion/planned-parenthood-title-x.html\">access to birth control</a> that is currently being waged in America is also, of course, about the regulation of female pleasure; under patriarchy women exist purely to service men and to reproduce. On Monday Alex Azar, the US health and human services secretary, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763496171/at-u-n-trump-administration-professes-no-international-right-to-an-abortion\">told the UN General Assembly that abortion isn\u2019t a human right</a>. \u201cWe do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions such as \u2018sexual and reproductive health and rights\u2019 in UN documents, because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices like abortion,\u201d he said. Azar, by the way, is a deeply religious Orthodox Christian who has been complicit in the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-azar-medicaid-20190401-story.html\">Trump\u2019s administrations attacks on Medicaid and Obamacare</a>. He is, in short, a morally-bankrupt religious zealot who hates women and wants to stamp out affordable health care. No wonder Trump picked him as his health secretary.</p> <h2>Mexico\u2019s Oaxaca state decriminalizes abortion</h2> <p>In slightly better reproductive rights news, Oaxaca has become the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/we-have-made-history-mexicos-oaxaca-state-decriminalises-abortion\">second jurisdiction in Mexico to decriminalize abortion, following Mexico City</a>.</p> <h2>New South Wales decriminalizes abortion</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s most populous state also joined the 21st century this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/25/abortion-decriminalisation-bill-passes-nsw-upper-house\">finally overturning a 119-year-old law banning abortion</a>.</p> <h2>Woman who started French #MeToo fined for defamation</h2> <p>Journalist Sandra Muller <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/woman-behind-french-metoo-fined-for-defamation/a-50587152\">has been ordered to pay thousands of euros in damages</a> to Eric Brion, a TV executive she accused of sexual harassment. Brion admits that he made inappropriate remarks to Muller but says her accusations wrongly portrayed him as a sex offender and ruined his career. Muller has called the ruling \u201ca message to shut up\u201d and will be appealing.</p> <h2>Women could boost Malaysia\u2019s economy</h2> <p>\u201cIf all economic barriers are removed for women in Malaysia, the country\u2019s income per capita could grow by 26.2%,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malaysia/publication/breaking-barriers-toward-better-economic-opportunities-for-women-in-malaysia\">according to the World Bank</a>.</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia loosens dress code for tourists</h2> <p>Foreign women will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/saudi-arabia-offer-tourist-visas-for-first-time\">no longer have to wear an abaya</a> (a loose robe), but will still have to dress modestly. The relaxed dress code is part of a wider tourism push and attempts by the kingdom to modernize its image. While these changes are encouraging, Saudi Arabia still very much practices a system of gender apartheid. Some of its most prominent female activists are also <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/loujain-al-hathloul-saudi-arabia-prison-jail-sister-lina-activist-a9117361.html\">still in jail</a>, and have reportedly been tortured.</p> <h2>Men are reporting women on Tinder for turning them down</h2> <p>Lauren Vinopal didn\u2019t want to go on a second date with a guy she met on Tinder. She turned him down nicely, saying she didn\u2019t want to lead him on.

Senior officers said they had evidence that smugglers were coordinating large-scale boat launches in a strategy to alleviate \u201cpent-up demand\u201d. Steve Reynolds, head of the NCA-led Invigor task force, which tackles organised immigration crime, told the Observer: \u201cThere is evidence of some degree of coordination. There have been some quite large events, surges, where there have been nine or 10 boats. \u201cDepending on the availability of the boats, the weather and other factors that smugglers consider relevant, we believe there is a pent-up demand that gets released in a mass departure.\u201d Two weeks ago the Border Force intercepted the highest number of migrants attempting to reach the UK in a single day, with 86 men, women and children attempting the journey in small boats. A theory is that smugglers have adopted the same principle used by criminal gangs, who despatch a number of drug mules on to flights in the knowledge that some, but not all, will be stopped. \u201cThere\u2019s no specific intelligence to suggest that they operate like cocaine couriers, where they maybe send 10 people on the basis that two are going to get caught and the other eight get through, but there might be \u2013 we just don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Reynolds said. The tactic of organised smuggling gangs using small boats to send migrants across the Channel has been in operation for around a year with more than 1,300 people crossing the busy shipping lane in 2018. Last Sunday, six men were taken to Dover, Kent, after attempting to cross the Channel in a dinghy, hours after four migrants were rescued from a stolen boat that got into difficulty off Calais. Days earlier, four small boats carrying 41 migrants were intercepted in the Channel. However Reynolds rejected the notion that there was a \u201cMr Big\u201d controlling the criminal trade. There was no evidence, he said, to suggest that an individual or gang was dictating proceedings from Iran, the starting point for the majority of migrants attempting the crossings. Similarly, there was little evidence that British-based gangs were involved, although Reynolds said that on occasions boats had left the UK, picked up migrants from the French coast and then returned. Following a crackdown by the French authorities on the supply of boats in coastal regions, the National Crime Agency has seen a rise in dinghies being bought hundreds of miles from the French coast, even as far away as Germany. Reynolds also said that migrants were now being brought directly to the French coast \u2013 usually the Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais stretch \u2013 by smugglers who then forced them on to often dangerous boats. \u201cSome of those that get on the boats are recruited away from the coast, brought in from further afield, maybe Germany, Belgium, and then bussed in and put on a boat,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Lewis Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes team have sacked four of their staff members and disciplined three more for racist bullying. The team launched an inquiry into racism at their Northamptonshire headquarters in July and concluded that the four men had breached their equality policy. They were dismissed on 2 August and their final appeal was held last week. The Sun newspaper reported on Saturday that the abuse at the Brackley site included a member of staff allegedly being referred to as a \u201cMuslim terrorist fuck\u201d. During Ramadan the sacked workers, believed to be from the IT department, were reported as putting up a poll on which they signed and dated guesses of when their co-worker would break his fast. A source told the paper: \u201cThis was a really horrible case of racist bullying. They had been picking on one Muslim guy for years. It all came to light when they pinned up the poll. The guys who were sacked had all signed and dated it. It\u2019s outrageous, especially with Lewis being so outspoken about racism.\u201d Hamilton, who is in action at the Russian Grand Prix this weekend and is still the only black driver in Formula One, has long been a vocal opponent of racism and called for greater diversity in the sport. After racist taunts aimed at England footballers in Montenegro in March, the world champion unequivocally condemned it before the Bahrain Grand Prix. \u201cIt is crazy to think that at this time in the world, racism is still such a prominent thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really there, all around the world, and a real issue, which is sad to see. It doesn\u2019t seem like it is going to migrate much over the next few years.\u201d His team confirmed in a statement that the sackings had taken place. \u201cMercedes-Benz Grand Prix Ltd confirms that four individuals were dismissed from the company on 2 August 2019,\u201d it read. \u201cThese dismissals followed an internal investigation that confirmed breaches of our diversity and equality policy. We condemn this behaviour in the strongest terms and acted immediately upon the complaint. We value the diversity of our employees and it is a source of strength for our team. Our working environment is based on appreciation and mutual respect.\u201d Three other members of staff are reported as being disciplined for breaching the team\u2019s diversity and equality policy.",

      "bodyText": "Melbourne ended the 80 minutes with four more completed sets than Sydney but the reality is they never looked like breaking down the awesome blue wall that confronted them. By contrast, the guile of Cronk, Keary and Cordner, and the brilliance of Tedesco meant the Roosters were always a threat with ball in hand. Despite the quality on display it wasn\u2019t the best of contests. The first half was littered with penalties and skill errors while the second hinged on Melbourne unlocking the Roosters defence during their 20 to 30 minute ascendancy, but they lacked inspiration against a well marshalled unit. Cooper Cronk gets one more game, and what a game it will be, a grand final against the Raiders next weekend. Cameron Smith? \u201cI\u2019ll have a think about it over the next few weeks,\u201d he tells Billy Slater, working for Nine. \u201cLot of stuff to weigh up.\u201d More on that to come, I\u2019m sure. Thank you for joining me tonight. Hopefully you\u2019ll be back here next week for the big one. The Roosters have done it again. 80 minutes away from back-to-back premierships. Sharper in attack and near impenetrable in defence tonight against their closest rivals. 79 mins: Roosters 14-6 Storm: Chaos ball time for Melbourne but it ends, predictably, in a knock-on. The Roosters are heading to the grand final. 78 mins: Roosters 14-6 Storm: Melbourne\u2019s dominant home and away season is going to end limply in the finals. Just 10 points at home to the Raiders and now heading for just six away to the Roosters. The lack of attacking creativity has been their undoing. 76 mins: Roosters 14-6 Storm: A crucial set for Melbourne with just five minutes remaining ends with Sandor Earl knocking on. The end is nigh. 74 mins: Roosters 14-6 Storm: How do the Roosters do it? Time after time Melbourne have probed but there\u2019s always a blue jersey when it matters. This time it\u2019s Tedesco, holding Brandon Smith up over the line after a superb sniping run almost reduced the deficit at the conclusion of a repeat set. 72 mins: Roosters 14-6 Storm: Melbourne tread water with their latest set. In response the Roosters keep the ball safely up their jerseys to make the task of finding eight points in eight minutes extremely arduous. 70 mins: Roosters 14-6 Storm: The Roosters consolidate their position with a strong set. Crichton, instrumental in Tedesco\u2019s try, almost threatened to break clear again. he\u2019s had a good night. 69 mins: Roosters 14-6 Storm: Mitchell kicks the decisive extras. That feels like a game-changing kick. The Storm were on top all half and looking the likelier as the game wore on but now find themselves with a mountain to climb. To make matters worse, in his desperation to save that Tedesco try Papenhuyzen was involved in a very nasty clash of heads with Bromwich. He is prone on the turf with a massive gash in his chin and claret everywhere. 69 mins: Roosters 12-6 Storm: Storm\u2019s lack of invention just isn\u2019t enough to penetrate such a strong defensive line. On tackle five they again play conservatively and offer little threat to the Roosters outside backs. By contrast, when Sydney break they look thrilling and linebreak after linebreak eventually ends with Cronk almost skipping through, but from the following play Tedesco bullies his way over. 66 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: There are massive hits going in all over the ground. The endurance of these athletes is something to behold. There\u2019s a brief pause while a scrum is set following a Roosters forward pass. Mitchell looks a bit proppy after twisting his ankle in a tackle. In other injury news it\u2019s now officially 16 v 16 with Aubusson done for the night after failing his HIA. 64 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: Melbourne\u2019s first error in possession this half sees the Roosters regain the ball on halfway. They look so dangerous with runners through the middle, Cordner especially, and he almost crosses before some desperate defence forces a poor kick on the last tackle. This game is coming to the boil nicely. 62 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: Another good Melbourne drive ends with Hughes launching an ugly bomb that the Roosters allow to bounce and make an almighty mess of. Storm think they\u2019re in twice down the left edge but they can\u2019t engineer enough space. They get another set though and again they think they\u2019re in down the left with Olam but a Rooster always seems to be there when it matters. The set ends with a Smith grubber that is mopped up superbly. The visitors are well on top. Can they convert it into points? 60 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: Solid set from Melbourne deep into Sydney territory. The Roosters respond with a decent six of their own. Some big hits being landed from both sides at the moment. You can practically see the SCG shaking when the forwards collide. 58 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: What a moment in this match. Following Storm\u2019s sloppy giveaway at the other end the Roosters drive downfield and Keary\u2019s bomb is collected by Manu in a contest with Munster before dancing under the posts. But hang on - the TMO has ruled during the mid-air contest Tedesco knocked on. Oooooooh, that is going to dominate the week ahead. That was touch and go but the bunker has seen something. Melbourne escape. 57 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: The Roosters can\u2019t get into this half. Another drive ends sloppily in their own half with Tedesco losing possession. Papenhuyzen lets them off though by kicking dead on the third tackle. The camera cuts to the coaches box where Bellamy can be seen mouthing \u201cWhat the F was that!?\u201d in utter disgust. 55 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: It\u2019s all Melbourne right now, but the Roosters defence is solid, even when Hughes out-jumps Tedesco for Munster\u2019s bomb. 54 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: There\u2019s suddenly some pep in Melbourne\u2019s step and a good set tests Sydney down the right wing. Cameron Smith is animated and gesturing for his side to strike while they have the ascendancy. Aubusson is now off for an HIA after contact in an awkward tackle. 52 mins: Roosters 8-6 Storm: Smith makes no mistake with the conversion. Game on at the SCG! 51 mins: Roosters 8-4 Storm: Hughes makes a rare line-break to create good attacking field position. Brandon Smith then darts forward to push Melbourne in sight of the line. Cameron Smith is smartly to the play the ball and he times his pass to the massive onrushing Asofa-Solomona to crash through and reach over the whitewash to bring Storm back in it. 49 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: The Roosters can\u2019t take advantage despite an avalanche of offloads, but they do pin Melbourne deep in their own territory - until a sloppy offside that is allows Cameron Smith the chance to boot clear. Jesse Bromwich is off for an HIA after that clash of heads, and he doesn\u2019t look good. 48 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: With their first proper possession of the half the Roosters break through Crichton, the ball-carrier taking advantage of a head clash between two Storm tacklers - Brandon Smith and Jesse Bromwich. Another Melbourne penalty gifts the Roosters a set of six in A1 field position. 46 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: Melbourne\u2019s third set in a row, all in attacking territory, sees plenty of neat offloads but little imagination or any real threat of unlocking the Roosters defence. It ends with a turnover in the left corner with the Sydney defensive line expertly reading the play. Idiotically, Jesse Bromwich then releases all that pressure with a needless penalty at the play the ball. 44 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: With good field position the Storm snipe left and right, throwing the ball around for the first time tonight and it ends with a Smith grubber returning to a white jersey after it was played at by a Roosters defender. Melbourne\u2019s best passage of the night by far, but they can\u2019t break through this blue wall despite recycling the ball to the right wing then Smith attempting another dribble through. This wave of attacking play ends with Cronk conceding a line drop-out. 43 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: Not for the first time tonight Keary looks wobbly fielding the restart but there\u2019s no harm done and the Roosters drive to halfway before kicking to Papenhuyzen, the man with the most dazzling individual stats of the first half. He runs well, as does Brandon Smith in a safe set that has a hiatus while the Storm fullback receives treatment after slipping on the centre square and knocking his head into the Roosters tackler. Belatedly Storm are awarded a penalty for the incident. 41 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: Second half underway! As the players make their way back out for the second half, a reminder Melbourne are down to 16 with Kaufusi ruled out after failing his HIA. The half ends with the hosts eight points to the good. It was a scrappy and unambitious half from both sides with errors and penalties interrupting the flow. The Roosters look far more dangerous with ball in hand but Melbourne will feel they\u2019re far from out of it trailing by such a slender margin. 39 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: Melbourne\u2019s bets chance yet. A solid drive ends with Munster launching a bomb to their attacking left corner. Papenhuyzen leaps, makes the catch, but on landing can\u2019t find a teammate to crash over from close range. To make matters worse Kaufusi has failed his HIA after that coming together with Keary. 37 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: The Roosters can\u2019t capitalise on their field position. This time they create space down the right but the Storm defence forces a rushed flick pass from Tedesco and it doesn\u2019t go to hands. 36 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: The Roosters again look shaky on the restart but no harm comes of some miscommunication in their left defensive corner. A safe set and a superb long kick and chase sees the Storm starting from their own 10m line. Smith guides his forwards downfield until Hughes goes for a long kick of his own to the left corner - but it lands on the line and the Roosters have another great opportunity. 33 mins: Roosters 8-0 Storm: The Roosters look so lively going forward and from their bonus set look to have created a gap for Tedesco to slip through near the posts but he\u2019s held up over the line. Storm are punished nonetheless for Hughes being offside during that passage and Mitchell makes no mistake from point-blank range. 30 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: Storm can\u2019t take advantage, Munster looking to his right shoulder in the hope of a flying back but all he sees is Finucane, and the forward is ill-suited to taking such a sharp pass on the burst. The ball hits the turf and the Roosters clear. Cordner turns a clearance into a counterattack with a superb burst, one that ends with a repeat set after Storm fail to gather a loose offload. 28 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: nice drive from the Roosters with Cronk, Cordner, Keary and Tedesco all involved on multiple occasions. They eventually create some space on the left wing but Tupou fluffs his lines, grasses a slippery pass and Storm breathe a sigh of relief. That breath gets even calmer when Taukeiaho strips in the tackle when there was already a teammate involved. 26 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: Oof! Kaufusi fends off Keary - pretty high but unpunished - sparking the Rooster into retaliating, grabbing a fistful of the Storm forward\u2019s afro and conceding a penalty in the process. Kaufusi leaves the field for a HIA. Melbourne can\u2019t capitalise on the territorial advantage with the ball ending out of touch down the left flank when two points were on offer from the penalty. The misjudgement is compounded by a penalty early in the Roosters set allowing them great attacking field position. 23 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: Melbourne cut that Roosters set short courtesy of a Brandon Smith steal, Smith on for Kenny Bromwich. The Storm probe but again as soon as they get close to the line there\u2019s a lack of guile to penetrate such a well marshalled defence. They get another option soon enough though by forcing a Roosters error in midfield. 21 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: Another decent set from the visitors ends with Tupou returning a bomb from the Roosters\u2019s left corner defensively, setting up Keary to kick with no little fortune and pin Melbourne into their own 20m. Storm\u2019s drive ends with Smith kicking too deep and handing Easts a seven tackle set. 19 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: Awful from the Roosters who knock-on from the restart handing Melbourne a full set just 20m out. Storm\u2019s first proper look at the Roosters tonight involves the ball going mainly into the hands of their powerful forwards before a grubber is safely pouched by Tedesco. The Roosters respond with a safety first set and solid kick-chase. 17 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: A rare and unexpected miss with the boot from Mitchell. 16 mins: Roosters 6-0 Storm: The first proper look at Tedesco tonight creates great field position for Keary to kick. Where does he go? High towards Chambers. The Storm defender is comprehensively beaten in the air by Tupou. Melbourne look like they\u2019ve held up the winger until a miraculous offload (or is it an inadvertent strip?) that ends at the feet of Cordner who collects and dives over. TMO studies the vision and confirms the on-field award. 14 mins: Roosters 2-0 Storm: The Roosters dive right, then left, stretching the Storm defence but then Mitchell coughs it up after just three tackles allowing Melbourne some much needed relief. Kaufusi turns security into attack with a beautiful offload to Papenhuyzen who dances through the Roosters defence. The set ends with Mitchell superbly claiming a Munster bomb in his in-goal. 12 mins: Roosters 2-0 Storm: Yet another penalty against the Storm, this time against Addo-Carr for trying to drag a Rooster over the sideline after the tackle was completed. The Roosters have a full set starting just 15m out. 10 mins: Roosters 2-0 Storm: The first bomb of the night is launched form Cronk to the right corner where Morris does well to recycle play but after an age of broken field running Melbourne regroup. That passage ends with Munster roosting a high ball with the Storm conceding yet another cheap penalty with a high shot at the end of the kick-chase. Ill-disciplined start from Melbourne. 8 mins: Roosters 2-0 Storm: Some lovely play from the Roosters down the middle with Cordner and Keary to the fore ends with some sharp hands down the left flank almost creating space for Tupou but the tap pass just drifted out of play. Hughes tries to counter for the Storm, chipping to himself down the guts but the bounce favours the Roosters - and the Melbourne man may have been tackled off the ball - and Easts can build again in dangerous territory. 6 mins: Roosters 2-0 Storm: Storm use their bonus field position to establish a sure footing before sniping down their left edge but the Roosters defence held firm. The Storm concede a penalty to relieve any pressure and accentuate the edgy start to this game. 4 mins: Roosters 2-0 Storm: A solid first set from the Roosters ends with Cronk kicking deep for Papenhuyzen. His carry back infield ends with the Roosters conceding a penalty for crowding at the play the ball. The crowd is right in this early. Plenty going on at the SCG. 2 mins: Roosters 2-0 Storm: Latrell Mitchell doesn\u2019t miss from 15m in from touch. One play, one kick, 12-men per side, 2-0 to the premiers. 1 min: Roosters 0-0 Storm: There\u2019s some biff on the first carry! Nelson Asofa-Solomona took the first carry and at the play the ball throws a couple of slaps at Siosiua Taukeiaho who then retaliates with a sharp jab. Ten minutes in the bin for both forwards for striking! Wow! What a start. The outcome on the field is a penalty to the Roosters. Underway at the SCG! The teams are making their way out onto the SCG. The Roosters are in their famous tricolour uniform, the Storm are in their change strip of predominately white with purple accents. Boyd Cordner did not attempt to play down the pain of missing the suspended Waerea-Hargreaves. \u201cHe leaves a big hole in the forward pack,\u201d the Easts skipper said. \u201cTo lose experience like that is not ideal.\u201d If you were wondering how big this match was, Channel 9 has it on its main channel in Melbourne, including the full pregame. How influential with the venue be tonight? After losing at the SCG in the opening round of the season to the Bunnies the Roosters have won nine on the spin at their temporary home. By contrast, this is Storm\u2019s first visit to the venerable old cricket ground. Tonight\u2019s winners will have to get past the Raiders after they prevailed in a low-scoring final against the Rabbitohs last night. Some NRLW stories to share, starting with the Broncos suffering their first ever loss, at the hands of the Warriors, in the curtain raiser to tonight\u2019s prelim. And a lovely tribute to Ruan Sims, the trailblazing rugby league star who will hang up her boots at the end of the season. Trent Robinson has just been on TV and he was asked about the likelihood of a few Garryowens heading Chambers\u2019s way. Plenty, was his answer. Melbourne have won the coin toss, the Roosters will kick-off. Cameron Smith could barely hide his disdain for having to participate in the process. It\u2019s dry under the lights at the SCG, but there\u2019s a brisk southerly keeping the temperatures on the cool side and offering an added degree of difficulty for anything aerial. Will Chambers in particular must be expecting plenty of bombs in his general direction. Craig Bellamy has also been forced into one change with flying winger Suliasi Vunivalu ruled out with a hamstring injury. That means a return for Will Chambers on the wing and the late inclusion of Sandor Earl on the bench, selected ahead of Joe Stimson who was named earlier in the week. 1. Ryan Papenhuyzen, 17.

The top two sides on this year\u2019s ladder, last season\u2019s grand finalists, and the most recent two premiers; match-ups do not get any bigger than this. Without intending to troll Raiders supporters, this fixture ought to be the grand final, but Canberra\u2019s excellence against Melbourne a fortnight ago and Souths last night means tonight\u2019s blockbuster is for the right to face the Raiders next weekend.

The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning from 6pm on Saturday to 5pm on Sunday and warned of persistent rain and a risk of flooding across the north-west and south-west of England and Wales. The flood alerts, which warn people to be prepared for possible flooding, were issued mainly for north-west and south-west England, with eight in force for Wales. The train operator Northern said no trains were running between Lancaster and Skipton because of a mudslide near Bentham. \u201cThe mud has completely covered the track in both directions, meaning we cannot run trains between Lancaster and Skipton,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe mudslide was discovered at around 7.45am when a Lancaster to Leeds service encountered problems on the line.\u201d A mudslide in north Yorkshire also blocked train lines, and a race meeting at Haydock in Merseyside on Saturday was cancelled due to waterlogged conditions. Flooding in Brampton, Cumbria, caused delays to trains between Carlisle and Newcastle, although National Rail said trains were beginning to return to normal shortly before 9am. There was also disruption on the roads, with the entry sliproad of the M65 at junction 10 for Burnley, Lancashire, closed due to flooding. The miserable weather follows an unsettled Friday, when a water spout was captured on camera near the Isle of Scalpay in the Outer Hebrides. The Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said areas such as Devon and Cornwall could experience coastal gales of up to 50mph, while 30mm- 40mm of rain was expected to fall within short periods over the weekend. Cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Bangor, Swansea and Cardiff are covered by the weather warning. It was updated on Saturday to exclude parts of the northern Pennines, which had previously been expected to experience showers, and include a larger part of south-west England. Burkill said: \u201cWe have got a deep area of low pressure that will bring heavy and persistent rain, and strong winds too. \u201cIn terms of rainfall totals, the greatest amounts could be up to 70mm. That will be over the hills and mountains. \u201cAway from there, some places could see 30mm to 40mm in a short space of time.\u201d He said there was likely to be some travel disruption with \u201clots of spray on the roads\u201d. Large waves and high spring tides could also increase the risk of \u201ccoastal impact\u201d in south-west England, he added. There would be sunny spells and showers across England and Wales before the worst of the weather arrived on Saturday evening. The weather warning prompted the cancellation of the inaugural Regatta London race, which was due to take place on the River Thames on Sunday. Organisers said they were unable to safely run the event due to stormy weather affecting the water quality.",

      "body": "<p>A friend of mine, the artist David Batchelor, had an exhibition in Edinburgh this summer called My Own Private Bauhaus. His title made me smile. I liked how it plays off <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Own_Private_Idaho\" title=\"\">Gus van Sant\u2019s 1991 indie film</a>, but with a tribute to the most influential art and design school of the last century \u2013 and possibly ever. It seemed to say something about influence and intimacy, about deeply personal journeys. Perhaps everyone has their own private Bauhaus, I thought.</p> <p>This year is <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">the centenary of the school </a><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">founded by Walter Gropius</a> in Weimar. Amid a slew of celebratory articles, it has often been forgotten that the Bauhaus was neither a movement nor a coherent style, but a strikingly varied art school. It encompassed craft and mysticism, teapots and mechanical ballets, parties and polemics. It was also extremely short-lived, closing under Nazi pressure after less than 15 years. As an inspiration, though, the Bauhaus has been exceptionally potent and portable. A hundred years later, it lives on in unexpected ways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f90334a156346135fa1d7f33a1c260dd66045d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f90334a156346135fa1d7f33a1c260dd66045d0/0_1256_4480_3859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Schwerdtfeger\u2019s Reflecting Color-Light-Play sculpture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"861\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurt Schwerdtfeger\u2019s Reflecting Color-Light-Play sculpture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Silke Briel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a curator, I came to making exhibitions by way of experimental music rather than art history. In the early 2000s, to be a music-obsessed teenager in Suffolk meant scouring the racks of record shops and the back pages of <a href=\"https://www.thewire.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Wire magazine</a>, rather than Spotify. This kind of fandom means, I think, supporting what dwells on the fringes of established canons. It also means becoming besotted by unlikely connections between art and music and design, where an album cover or something hidden deep in the liner notes puts you on to something completely new. </p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the last couple of years researching an exhibition that explores the Bauhaus\u2019s many afterlives in Britain. It is titled Still Undead, a nod to a line from the 1982 song <em>Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead</em>, by the Northampton goth band <a href=\"https://pleasekillme.com/bauhaus-undead/\" title=\"\">Bauhaus</a>.

      "bodyText": "A friend of mine, the artist David Batchelor, had an exhibition in Edinburgh this summer called My Own Private Bauhaus. His title made me smile. I liked how it plays off Gus van Sant\u2019s 1991 indie film, but with a tribute to the most influential art and design school of the last century \u2013 and possibly ever. It seemed to say something about influence and intimacy, about deeply personal journeys. Perhaps everyone has their own private Bauhaus, I thought. This year is the centenary of the school founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar. Amid a slew of celebratory articles, it has often been forgotten that the Bauhaus was neither a movement nor a coherent style, but a strikingly varied art school. It encompassed craft and mysticism, teapots and mechanical ballets, parties and polemics. It was also extremely short-lived, closing under Nazi pressure after less than 15 years. As an inspiration, though, the Bauhaus has been exceptionally potent and portable. A hundred years later, it lives on in unexpected ways. As a curator, I came to making exhibitions by way of experimental music rather than art history. In the early 2000s, to be a music-obsessed teenager in Suffolk meant scouring the racks of record shops and the back pages of The Wire magazine, rather than Spotify. This kind of fandom means, I think, supporting what dwells on the fringes of established canons. It also means becoming besotted by unlikely connections between art and music and design, where an album cover or something hidden deep in the liner notes puts you on to something completely new. I\u2019ve spent the last couple of years researching an exhibition that explores the Bauhaus\u2019s many afterlives in Britain. It is titled Still Undead, a nod to a line from the 1982 song Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead, by the Northampton goth band Bauhaus. Not only did they borrow their name from the school, but also their logo and typeface. After the school closed in 1933, its masters and students \u2013 at least, those fortunate enough to be able to leave Germany \u2013 scattered around the world. A number came to Britain, a jarring introduction to the class system and mostly unenthusiastic cultural institutions. But this indifference pushed them into surprising places. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, ever energetic, spent an almost impossibly prolific couple of years in London, where he designed everything from sci-fi special effects to shop-window displays. Lucia Moholy \u2013 L\u00e1szl\u00f3\u2019s first wife, who remains under-recognised \u2013 took portraits of counts and countesses. Another Bauhaus-trained photographer, Edith Tudor-Hart, captured arresting documentary images of interwar street life. The barely known Ludwig Hirschfeld-Mack made fantastical musical instruments with school kids in Peckham, southeast London, and coal miners in Wales. The list goes on. Terence Conran once said something to the effect that the British are completely allergic to modernism. The only way he thought it could be smuggled in was under the cover of pop culture. And it is true that the Bauhaus can be detected everywhere from Factory Records to Liberty fabrics, from Kraftwerk to James Bond. The title sequences for both From Russia with Love (1963) and Goldfinger (1964), for example, involve films and animated typefaces projected on to dancing figures. These were devised by the American graphic designer Robert Brownjohn, a former protege of Moholy-Nagy. Brownjohn was drawing on experiments in movement and projected light that can be traced all the way back to the props devised by Bauhaus students for parties in the 1920s. You can even trace a line between the Bauhaus and Vidal Sassoon, another fixture of Swinging London. In the early 60s, around the time that Conran was setting up Habitat, Sassoon crossed paths with the architect Marcel Breuer (whose tubular steel furniture today encapsulates one popular image of the Bauhaus). This meeting was crucial for the hairstylist, who credited his invention of the five-point bob to the Bauhaus focus on structure and geometry. A decade on, when styles had shifted from clean-lined bobs to mohawks, Sassoon turned to the Bauhaus once again. This time, he created a series of vivid dye jobs with a palette borrowed from the colour theory of Johannes Itten, the Swiss painter-mystic who cast a spell over the Bauhaus\u2019s early years. Models with shocks of pink Sassoon-styled hair were shot by the Australian photographer Robyn Beeche, who documented the denizens of nightclubs such as Blitz in Covent Garden and the Alternative Miss World contests in the 1980s. One muse was her countryman Leigh Bowery. Many of the more fantastical costumes captured by Beeche, and worn by Bowery, feel directly sampled from Bauhaus ballets.

The first night had hiccups, the galloping speeds from the pit causing a few hazards, but zest and intensity, together with Handel\u2019s genius, won out. The opera is a study in deceit, with the only honest figure \u2013 Ottone, played with noble despair by the British countertenor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/28/iestyn-davies-countertenor-farinelli-interview\" title=\"\">Iestyn Davies</a> \u2013 suffering the deepest anguish. His plea for help (\u201cOtton, Otton, qual portentoso fulmine\u201d), rising out of sour, dark dissonances in the orchestra, came as a sober indictment of the amorality of those around him.

      "bodyText": "Right, that seems like a good a place as any to leave it. After a stunning morning I am in need of a well-earned break. Thanks for all your emails and tweets, hope you enjoyed our coverage. Great reactions at full time: There is more action in Japan this morning. Lee Calvert is on South Africa v Namibia: Bevan Jones writes in: Can the Guardian please not refer to Ireland as not taking their opponents seriously... Japan absolutely got their tactics and game plan spot on. Ireland didn\u2019t underestimate Japan, the opposition was just better. Great game! I do not think anyone here will be taking anything away from Japan. I was at the game in Brighton four years ago and this was a different type of win for Japan. There was an element of smash and grab then but after the first 15 minutes, this was a dominant performance from Japan that exploited Ireland\u2019s weaknesses to perfection. More bad news for Ireland. Jack Conan has fractured his foot and will head home. The Japanese Croydon Box Park is very polite: The Japanese head coach is clearly bouncing: We\u2019re ecstatic about the result, we\u2019re very proud of the players. We had a plan and have trained for a long time, we have been thinking about this game for quite a long time and obviously Ireland have only been thinking about it for the last six or seven days. For us it\u2019s been a great performance. You have to be carful before the game, you don\u2019t want to come across too arrogant and cocky. We had a lot of belief in our game plan and knew how strong Ireland were. Credit to my coaching team, at the set piece we were able to hold theirs. Now it\u2019s phase two, we\u2019ve got another couple of games to go but we\u2019ll enjoy tonight I reckon. Paul Rees is at Shizuoka Stadium and witnessed another miracle. Here is his report: The Irish captain is magnanimous in defeat: We knew how tough it was going to be. Anyone that thought was utterly shocked hasn\u2019t seen how good they are. We came in a game plan and we felt we were really prepared. Give credit to them, they played really well and we made a few mistakes, a few unforced errors and were on the wrong side of the penalty count. They posed a lot of questions and we couldn\u2019t come up with he answers. With that win Japan go top of Pool A. Check on the tables following this morning\u2019s games here: Schmidt offers his post-match thoughts and whilst the Ireland head coach is gracious he questions the penalty count. Unsubtle deflection, Joe. In a momentous moment that shows the growth of world rugby, we have had emails in from Canada (the Yukon and British Columbia), Somalia, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Italy and the Balearic Islands. Talk about a dedicated following! A fe words from an overawed Japanese captain: We\u2019re really happy, proud of every boy. [Brighton] was a great game, but we came into this game knowing what we wanted to do and we\u2019ve done it. We heard the crowd, especially in the last ten minutes. Bizarre end to the game as Ireland. With the hooter gone boot they ball out of play, the chances of a turnaround were slim but that a baffling decision. JAPAN WIN! 80 mins: Last minute now... 79 mins: Tanaka waits to put in and lets the clock tick away some more. 78 mins: Kenki Fukuoka intercepts and it looks like the game as he sprint some 60 metres but Earls somehow catches the Japanese replacement five metres from the Ireland line. It is a knock on though and Japan have a scrum under the posts. 75 mins: Japan pinged for not rolling away in the ruck, Carbery\u2019s kick is poor though. Ireland lineout inside the Japan half, they need something now. 74 mins: Japan scrum as Ireland knock on. This will kill the clock some more. Japan have a seven point lead! They get their reward for bravery in their own half, passing their way out and forcing a penalty. The fly-half\u2019s kick is drifting but it it through. 71 mins: From the scrum Japan burst forward again and Murray is pinged for offside. Tamura with a decent chance to extend this lead! This might be a first, Adil from Mogadishu writes in: Worried for Ireland, Japan are moving and passing menacingly. If Japan can turn the momentum, it\u2019s all up for grabs. I\u2019m following from Mogadishu! The city is on the road to recovery and with a few fortunate penalties and tries, Japan could be on the road to glory! 69 mins: A hole opens in the middle for Kearney but it closes quickly. A pass forward from Murray a few phases later and Japan have a chance to slow this down. Little over ten minutes left and these moments will be vital if w are to get (another) famous upset. 66 mins: Great kick from Tamura to get his side up the halfway, knocking back the marker flag. 65 mins: Huge cheers as Japan hold firm and win a penalty five metres from their own line to turn the ball over. 64 mins: How can the Irish respond? Japan are still coming up so quick to the line but Ireland are trying to match them. This is great to watch. Thompson goes off for Japan, Wimpie van der Walt is on. Nakajima on for Inagaki too. 62 mins: Cronin and Carbery are both as Schmidt starts to empty his bench. 59 mins: Accidental offside from the Irish and it is a scrum for Japan 15 metres out. Fukuoka pounces after neat handling across the Japanese line, Lafaele in particular. Tamura knocks over the extras. What are we seeing here? 58 mins: Rhys Ruddock is on in the back row for Ireland. 57 mins: Japan are rumbling. They string together ten phases before losing the ball forward deep in the Irish half. Nagare goes off for the experienced Fumiaki Tanaka. 55 mins: Tamura bangs it from distance but gets his line wrong as they kick drifts left. 52 mins: Matsushima\u2019s wonderful side step takes Japan from behind their own line all the way to halfway. That was electric from the wing and Ireland look a little rattled as a knock-on inside the Irish half is followed by another mistake giving Yamanaka a chance to level. 48 mins: Yamanaka goes up unchallenged for a Murray kick and comes down without the ball. Scrum Ireland in the Japan half, but that is a soft one. 47 mins: Andrew Porter on for Tadhg Furlong and David Kilcoyne on for Cian Healy as the Irish make replacements in the pack. 46 mins: Japan playing fast and loose in midfield to start the half, this suits the hosts a lot more than the Irish. No fear from the Brave Blossoms who seem prepared to play through the hands and offload even in their own half. 43 mins: Early Irish scrum in their own half but Carty kicks deep into Japanese half. This is clearly where Schmidt wants his side to play in the second half. 41 mins: The second half is underway. Charlie is at the game in Fukuroi City: At the game with my mum and what an electric atmosphere! Genuine hope for Japan here especially with Fukuoka coming off the bench - he will cause some damage. Ganbare Nippon!!! From Canada to Japan, you are welcome. In a feat of extraordinary internet coverage, Yukonyourownway emails in from a remote Canadian location: Following your blog sitting in a tent in the Yukon surrounded by bears (much like the swarming Irish offence). To me there\u2019s only one outcome here. Stay strong Japan, they look in their element (unlike me with only a steak knife for protection). Japan have Ireland on the ropes as the first half ticks into extra time, putting together their most phases of the game. A cute grubber kick through almost releases Yamanaka on the left but the full-back cannot quite keep it in play and with that the half ends. After missing one early the Japanese fly-half makes amends as his kick bows back from left to right to dissect the post. 38 mins: Japan probe in midfield and earn a penalty as they make their way in increments up the field. Tamura now with a chance to cut the lead to just three points... 35 mins: Ireland scrum from a Japan knock on. Huge roar as Brave Blossoms trample the Irish and earn a penalty against the head. Conor Murray holds on in the ruck and Tamura is able to knock over an easy kick from close range. Japan are keeping this close. 31 mins: James Moore errs in the ruck as he tries to pick and go from the ruck, slightly unlucky. Michael Leitch is on for Amanaki Mafi as Japan are forced into an early change. That is a blow for the hosts, though the captain is very capable replacement. 29 mins: Defensive scrum for Ireland, 15 metres out from their own line. 27 mins: Tim Lafaele\u2019s little flick lifts the crowd creates a chance for Japan as Matsushima chases a kick behind. Whenever Japan get on the front foot they look fast and dangerous. Ireland may have two ties and the lead but they are not having it all their own way. 24 mins: The cross kick is clearly the order of the day for Ireland, they go to it straight from the restart and make good ground before a Rory Best knock-on eases the pressure. There is a quick check for a knock-on as Rob Kearney gets on to Ringrose\u2019s paddle back from another speculative Carty kick from near the try line to allow the full-back to bundle over. The TMO is happy and this time Carty converts. 19 mins: Ireland dominate the game\u2019s first scrum as Inagaki rolls around the corner. Carty kicks for the corner. It is not the prettiest kick you have ever seen but it is over and Japan strike back. 16 mins: Tamura will get a chance to cut the deficit almost immediately as Stander is pinged for offside. Straight kick from shorter range this time. Carty knows he has a penalty in his pocket and from 15 metres in the front of the posts the fly-half dinks a lovely cross kick towards the right wing, where Ringrose gets above his man and spins over. Carty cannot convert though. 12 mins: A muscular run from Stockdale as Ireland work it right to left, offloading to Ringrose who almost beats his man around the outside. Japan hold firm but their attempt to run it out does not get far and Ireland continue to pile on the pressure. 9 mins: Jack Carty tries the spectacular with a flat cross kick from a penalty trying to pick out Keith Earls. The winger cannot quite pull off the spectacular finish and Japan breathe again. Bold intent from Ireland, turning down easy points. 6 mins: Big opportunity missed by Japan to take an early lead as Yu Tamura hooks a straightforward penalty from in front of the posts left. You feel these are the chances that have to go the hosts way. 3 mins: If you want to see an upset then this start Japan needed. Confident handling and a rapid tempo from the Brave Blossoms creates the first chance as a little dink rolls towards the Irish line and Ryoto Nakamura is desperately unlucky as he does not get the bounce of the ball.. 1 min: And we are underway. Ireland earn an early lineout from the kick off. Five minutes until kick-off and the team are heading down the tunnel. Steely faces all around at the Shizuoka Stadium. Ireland: Rob Kearney; Keith Earls, Garry Ringrose, Chris Farrell, Jacob Stockdale; Jack Carty, Conor Murray; Cian Healy, Rory Best, Tadhg Furlong, Iain Henderson, James Ryan; Peter O\u2019Mahony, Josh van der Flier, CJ Stander. Replacements: Sean Cronin, David Kilcoyne, Andrew Porter, Tadh Beirne, Rhys Ruddock, Luke McGrath, Joey Carbery, Jordan Larmour. Japan: Ryohei Yamanaka; Kotaro Matsushima, Timothy Lafaele, Ryoto Nakamura, Lomano Lemeki; Yu Tamura, Yutaka Nagare; Keita Inagaki, Shota Horie, Koo Ji-Wan, Luke Thompson, James Moore; Kazuki Himeno, Lappies Labuschagne, Amanaki Mafi. Replacements: Atsushi Sakate, Isieli Nakajima, Asaeli Ai Valu, Wimpie van der Walt, Fumiaki Tanaka, Rikiya Matsuda, Lomano Lemeki. This is where the test of Japan\u2019s credentials really starts then. After dispatching Russia in empowering but ultimately expected fashion the second best team in the world are in town to ruin the dreams of the Brave Blossoms. Jamie Joseph\u2019s men have enjoyed a seven-day turnaround never usually reserved for the second tier sides at a World Cup and will have needed every minute to prepare for Joe Schmidt\u2019s side. Perhaps a grain of hope can be found for Japan in that they are not facing an Ireland team able to draw on the talents of their world class fly-half, Johnny Sexton. Jack Carty will start at ten as Ireland make four changes to the side that brushed off Scotland. Although, that they could make such light work of of their Six Nations rivals without the need for Sexton to kick rom early in the first half is ominous. Japan captain Michael Leitch is the shock omission from their starting XV, with Joseph opting to bring fit-again Amanaki Mafi into the back row, with flanker Lappies Labuschagne taking over as skipper. For the sequel to the Brighton Miracle, the Shizuoka Shock will need to be equally well executed. In England four years ago, Japan never let South Africa out of their sight, always retaining a measure of control over the scoreline and to earn a repeat would take something similar.",

      "body": "<p>This spring, I visited northern Spain, following rural roads along arable fields, rushing streams and through the Pyrenees. I was amazed at the variety of plant life contained within such a comparatively small area. While I was unacquainted with some species, many were familiar, either as wildflowers found also in Britain or as the forebears of popular garden cultivars. Violet spires of tufted vetch sprung underfoot down riverbanks, and the bright petals of sweet rocket (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/8681/i-Hesperis-matronalis-i/Details\" title=\"\">Hesperis matronalis</a></em>), a southern European biennial I have often sown for cut flowers, appeared beneath thickets of beech, glowing at dusk.</p> <p>The trip left a strong impression. It highlighted for me one of western Europe\u2019s greatest assets: an easily navigable terrain abounding in attractive and diverse flora. We British islanders have an intrinsic affiliation with these plants: our flora is cut from a similar cloth \u2013 only the patterns of the cloth become more varied and splendid across the Channel.</p> <p>So when I was invited to join my in-laws for a week in northern Italy this summer, I persuaded my wife that we should drive, rather than fly, to enjoy some of the magnificent floral landscapes our continent has to offer \u2013 and find inspiration for our own back garden.</p> <p>Thankfully, I had economics on my side: seasonal flights were astronomical, and the substitution of a tent for pricey hotels would more or less balance out the petrol costs. But there was also a certain hankering \u2013 exacerbated by Brexit turmoil \u2013 to revisit the continental family road trips fondly remembered from my childhood: the exotic road signs, open views and cheesy croissants.</p> <p>Ferry crossing booked, campsites reserved and the car hastily equipped with regulation EU breakdown accessories, we left London for the white cliffs. That same July morning, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> prepared for Downing Street; I looked forward to Radio 4\u2019s coverage fading and being replaced by the soothing escapism of Europop. Here is some of the horticultural inspiration I found in the European landscape, from seeing flowers and plants in their natural habitat, that might be applied back home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c891d000dd3ef7547b1121050c1312c8bb682cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c891d000dd3ef7547b1121050c1312c8bb682cf/0_354_3421_4274/800.jpg\" alt=\"Blue chicory is emblematic of French farmland\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue chicory is emblematic of French farmland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Mosolova/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wild chicory</strong></h2> <p>Somewhere between Dunkirk and Reims, Europe\u2019s midsummer heatwave caught up with us and our air con gave up. But the roadsides offered a marvellous distraction, thanks to flashes of chicory (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/41554/i-Cichorium-intybus-i/Details\" title=\"\">Cichorium intybus</a></em>) \u2013 a wildflower emblematic of French farmland, whose sky-blue petals contrast wonderfully with the country\u2019s golden wheatfields. Its seed is inexpensive and well worth sowing as a pollinator-friendly alternative to cornflowers or calendula.</p> <h2><strong>Great burnet</strong></h2> <p>Crossing into southern Germany, the Black Forest offered respite from the heat with shady trees and cool Lake Titisee. Walking among the valley\u2019s damp, sunlit glades, we encountered colourful swathes of meadowsweet and harebell, and the compact maroon bobbles of great burnet (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/16403/i-Sanguisorba-officinalis-i/Details\" title=\"\">Sanguisorba officinalis</a></em>). Popularised by \u201cprairie style\u201d garden designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/piet-oudolf-gardens-hampton-court-palace-flower-show\" title=\"\">Piet Ou</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/piet-oudolf-gardens-hampton-court-palace-flower-show\" title=\"\">dolf</a>, cultivated forms such as <em><a href=\"https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/sanguisorba-officinalis-red-thunder/\" title=\"\">S</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/sanguisorba-officinalis-red-thunder/\" title=\"\">.</a></em><a href=\"https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/sanguisorba-officinalis-red-thunder/\" title=\"\"> \u2018Red Thunder\u2019</a> make fantastic border plants. I grow these wilder blooms alongside low-spreading perennials such as <em><a href=\"https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/alchemilla-mollis/\" title=\"\">Alchemilla mollis</a></em> or <a href=\"https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/geranium-rozanne/\" title=\"\">geranium \u2018Rozanne\u2019</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Mountain succulents</strong></h2> <p>Winding through the botanical wonderland that is alpine Switzerland, I wanted to pull over at every turn to identify astonishing, unexpected flowers. Our tent erected outside the scenic ski town of St Moritz, I scrambled back to find a few earmarked species: alpine willowherb, gorgeous orange arnica daisies and little orchids. The true gems, however, hunkered low and damp with cloud, were the intricate flowers of <em><a href=\"http://encyclopaedia.alpinegardensociety.net/plants/Sempervivum/montanum?user=none\" title=\"\">Sempervivum montanum</a></em>. Britain\u2019s flourishing succulent obsession has brought houseleeks to the fore, admired for their fleshy leaf rosettes. The ephemeral flowers, however, are rather special: stars of mauve-pink with acid green centres. As hardy alpines, sempervivums perform best in a small garden pot, placed in full sun, with lots of grit for drainage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e33ef7e0782238da544695083eca6e35739caeb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e33ef7e0782238da544695083eca6e35739caeb8/0_170_5197_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pasqueflower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pasqueflower - from the buttercup family \u2013 make a great garden feature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pasqueflower</strong></h2> <p>Another superb plant growing nearby was pulsatilla. An early bloomer of the buttercup family, its silky, anemone-like flowers are now a rarity in the wild in the UK, but still occupy calcium-rich grassland in certain European hotspots. Equally attractive are the seedheads that follow \u2013 giant fluffy globes similar to those of wild clematis, which appeared illuminated in the afternoon sunlight. I was reminded how good a garden feature pasqueflower makes \u2013 particularly the purple <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/14184/pulsatilla-vulgaris/details\" title=\"\">P. vulgaris</a></em> \u2013 throughout spring and early summer, when grown in a sunny, gravel-mulched bed. </p> <h2><strong>Perennial meadows</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve grown increasingly fond of the border regions of northern Italy, with their blend of cultures, rolling scenery and labyrinthine little roads. Lombardy and Trentino-Alto Adige, whose hills are alive with the sound of Austrian cowbells, were awash with bewilderingly beautiful flower meadows as we passed \u2013 floral carpets studded with sainfoin, salvia, yellow rattle and scabious.

      "bodyText": "This spring, I visited northern Spain, following rural roads along arable fields, rushing streams and through the Pyrenees. I was amazed at the variety of plant life contained within such a comparatively small area. While I was unacquainted with some species, many were familiar, either as wildflowers found also in Britain or as the forebears of popular garden cultivars. Violet spires of tufted vetch sprung underfoot down riverbanks, and the bright petals of sweet rocket (Hesperis matronalis), a southern European biennial I have often sown for cut flowers, appeared beneath thickets of beech, glowing at dusk. The trip left a strong impression. It highlighted for me one of western Europe\u2019s greatest assets: an easily navigable terrain abounding in attractive and diverse flora. We British islanders have an intrinsic affiliation with these plants: our flora is cut from a similar cloth \u2013 only the patterns of the cloth become more varied and splendid across the Channel. So when I was invited to join my in-laws for a week in northern Italy this summer, I persuaded my wife that we should drive, rather than fly, to enjoy some of the magnificent floral landscapes our continent has to offer \u2013 and find inspiration for our own back garden. Thankfully, I had economics on my side: seasonal flights were astronomical, and the substitution of a tent for pricey hotels would more or less balance out the petrol costs. But there was also a certain hankering \u2013 exacerbated by Brexit turmoil \u2013 to revisit the continental family road trips fondly remembered from my childhood: the exotic road signs, open views and cheesy croissants. Ferry crossing booked, campsites reserved and the car hastily equipped with regulation EU breakdown accessories, we left London for the white cliffs. That same July morning, Boris Johnson prepared for Downing Street; I looked forward to Radio 4\u2019s coverage fading and being replaced by the soothing escapism of Europop. Here is some of the horticultural inspiration I found in the European landscape, from seeing flowers and plants in their natural habitat, that might be applied back home. Wild chicory Somewhere between Dunkirk and Reims, Europe\u2019s midsummer heatwave caught up with us and our air con gave up. But the roadsides offered a marvellous distraction, thanks to flashes of chicory (Cichorium intybus) \u2013 a wildflower emblematic of French farmland, whose sky-blue petals contrast wonderfully with the country\u2019s golden wheatfields. Its seed is inexpensive and well worth sowing as a pollinator-friendly alternative to cornflowers or calendula. Great burnet Crossing into southern Germany, the Black Forest offered respite from the heat with shady trees and cool Lake Titisee. Walking among the valley\u2019s damp, sunlit glades, we encountered colourful swathes of meadowsweet and harebell, and the compact maroon bobbles of great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis). Popularised by \u201cprairie style\u201d garden designer Piet Oudolf, cultivated forms such as S. \u2018Red Thunder\u2019 make fantastic border plants. I grow these wilder blooms alongside low-spreading perennials such as Alchemilla mollis or geranium \u2018Rozanne\u2019. Mountain succulents Winding through the botanical wonderland that is alpine Switzerland, I wanted to pull over at every turn to identify astonishing, unexpected flowers. Our tent erected outside the scenic ski town of St Moritz, I scrambled back to find a few earmarked species: alpine willowherb, gorgeous orange arnica daisies and little orchids. The true gems, however, hunkered low and damp with cloud, were the intricate flowers of Sempervivum montanum. Britain\u2019s flourishing succulent obsession has brought houseleeks to the fore, admired for their fleshy leaf rosettes. The ephemeral flowers, however, are rather special: stars of mauve-pink with acid green centres. As hardy alpines, sempervivums perform best in a small garden pot, placed in full sun, with lots of grit for drainage. Pasqueflower Another superb plant growing nearby was pulsatilla. An early bloomer of the buttercup family, its silky, anemone-like flowers are now a rarity in the wild in the UK, but still occupy calcium-rich grassland in certain European hotspots. Equally attractive are the seedheads that follow \u2013 giant fluffy globes similar to those of wild clematis, which appeared illuminated in the afternoon sunlight. I was reminded how good a garden feature pasqueflower makes \u2013 particularly the purple P. vulgaris \u2013 throughout spring and early summer, when grown in a sunny, gravel-mulched bed. Perennial meadows I\u2019ve grown increasingly fond of the border regions of northern Italy, with their blend of cultures, rolling scenery and labyrinthine little roads. Lombardy and Trentino-Alto Adige, whose hills are alive with the sound of Austrian cowbells, were awash with bewilderingly beautiful flower meadows as we passed \u2013 floral carpets studded with sainfoin, salvia, yellow rattle and scabious. Perennial meadows such as these require patience to establish, but in the right conditions they can be enormously rewarding, both visually and for wildlife.

Once every decade, this annual migration through Europe swells in magnitude; spotting painted ladies along the trip therefore became something of a game, spying them alighting on thistles, nettles and other flowers. This astonishing journey is dependent on the availability of such \u201cweeds\u201d, urging us to reconsider their eradication from our gardens. Thistles, for example, are a vital food source and host plant for the painted lady. Wild strawberries The final leg of the journey arched down towards the Veneto, through a landscape familiar from a visit earlier this year. In spring, this region\u2019s woodland trails had been adorned with aquilegia, helleborine orchids and wild strawberry flowers. These blooms were now succeeded by papery seedheads and, for the strawberry, by fruit. Of Europe\u2019s copious native flowers, the wild strawberry has to be among the most beloved, but it is equally at home in the garden as in the hedgerow, offering ground cover, the surprise of fruit and delicate, understated petals. Wild strawberry is a fantastic plant for moist soils in full or partial sun, where it may naturally multiply with vigorous runners. Common ivy On the ferry home, I flicked through my notebook and totted up the plants I\u2019d seen. Interestingly, one particular species made several appearances: the unassuming common ivy, Hedera helix. When not climbing stucco walls or swamping woodland, it was employed as an underplant for trees and shrubs, clipped neatly at the edges. This is nothing new (it is a staple of Italian gardens) but a practice somewhat undervalued. If pruned back regularly and thus prevented from feral wanderings, ivy shelters roots from a hot sun, suppresses unwanted seedlings and provides a tranquil green canvas: a truly \u201ccontinental\u201d effect. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Essentially: to get on an episode, now, the groom clearly has to pitch the worst possible idea for a wedding \u2013 Game of Thrones-themed? An adrenalin experience for the bride? Jacuzzi wedding? \u2013 and make it happen. So you\u2019re basically watching a man who can\u2019t plan a cup of tea somehow throw a lavish party to the exacting standards of the woman he alleges to love but who, almost always, very visibly hates him. Actually: that sounds amazing. It\u2019s still amazing.",

      "body": "<p>She grips my hand and tows me behind her around the small courtyard garden, past the pretend bus stop and the red phone box with no dialling tone, down an alleyway of gravel that leads to a wooden gate. \u201cHere,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may be locked.\u201d</p> <p>It is, of course, securely padlocked. It\u2019s hidden away but still Mum has found it. I take her by the arm. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. We can get out the other way,\u201d I say, leading her inside, through the chintzy cafe where no money is exchanged, to the lift. I bleep my electronic visitor\u2019s pass. The doors to the outside world open for us. Mum walks through them, asking no questions, and admires the flowerbeds.</p> <p>Even though she cannot remember what happened 10 minutes ago or when she last ate, even though this once immaculate lady, left to herself, would head for the street in a petticoat and one earring (\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, does it,\u201d she said when I mentioned it), in spite of the holes in her mind that dementia has torn, the desire to go out appears hardwired. She found that gate, and then she remembered where she had found it.</p> <p>Earlier I watched as Jean, Mum\u2019s neighbour in the dementia home, walked up and down the corridor between her room and the communal area, tall and thin in her plaid skirt and jumper, the usual copy of the Times under her arm and anxiety on her face. Up and down. Back and forth. \u201cHas my mother come?\u201d she asks the carers. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid your family aren\u2019t visiting today,\u201d is the answer. Her mother died years ago. They sit her down, suggest television or a game, and she is instantly on her feet, asking the same question again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67bceae8b1cc9aa2967088363f0c66c2f067d81a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67bceae8b1cc9aa2967088363f0c66c2f067d81a/761_1636_3799_2374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"July Hopkins holds a photograph of her younger self.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Judith (July) Hopkins (above), who was a homemaker and teacher, holds a photograph of her younger self</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Hammond/Witness Change/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dementia is the scourge of our age. We have become so good at patching people up bodily that for many, it is the mind that goes; dementia now kills more people than any other disease in England and Wales, accounting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/06/alzheimers-dementia-leading-cause-death-england-wales\" title=\"\">12.8% of deaths last year</a>. In 2017 <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia\" title=\"\">it affected an estimated 50 million people globally</a>, with nearly a million in the UK; the numbers are expected to double every 20 years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/26/david-cameron-dementia-funding-boost\" title=\"\">David Cameron launched a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/26/david-cameron-dementia-funding-boost\" title=\"\">research push </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/26/david-cameron-dementia-funding-boost\" title=\"\">for a cure</a> in 2012, but one drug trial after another has collapsed, casting doubt on fundamental assumptions about what happens in the deteriorating brain. The central approach \u2013 targeting the buildup of amyloid plaques \u2013 appears to be going nowhere much.</p> <p>Meanwhile, less attention is being paid to how we care for those whose minds are irretrievably unravelling, to where and how they should live. <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media\" title=\"\">Most people in care homes</a> \u2013 70% \u2013 now have dementia. It may be best for many to stay at home as long as possible \u2013 but that means 24-hour care. The distinction between day and night can disappear. One of the first warning signs my three sisters and I had came when Mum started annoying the neighbours in her block of flats, pressing doorbells to be let back in at 5am.</p> <p>Then there were the parcels. I drove her home one day, to find a large brown box outside the door. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said, in genuine distress. \u201cNot another one.\u201d It contained what she and I would both have called quack remedies for ageing: potions and pills, and a Christmas cracker trinket of a bracelet. Inside was an invoice, paid on her credit card, for over \u00a3100. She had not ordered or paid for it, she insisted. And there were others. She had a cupboard full of expensive soaps and knick-knacks \u2013 a \u201csound amplifier\u201d for \u00a330 (there is nothing wrong with her hearing), a \u201ccabbage detox\u201d for \u00a320. It had all been sent by two companies at the same address in France. I was livid. How dare they take advantage of her? But I now think she started it, sending off magazine coupons for hand lotion, though I know they got her to order more junk thereafter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9e636a7912cd10a95ee11e7527794adacbf74c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9e636a7912cd10a95ee11e7527794adacbf74c0/0_0_5359_5359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Norman Thomas, 68, who has dementia, against a black background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Thomas, 68: \u2018My wife thinks I\u2019m losing the plot.

The flat smelling of burnt toast. I bought a new toaster. Her empty purse when she went out for coffee with friends. They paid. Her frequent trips in person to the bank. It didn\u2019t occur to me that she no longer knew her pin number. The huge bills she was running up for newspaper delivery. The shopkeeper kindly said nothing. The frightening times I called in the evening, when it was dark, and there was no reply. Finally she would answer, out of breath. She had taken the wrong bus. One time she said a nice man had driven her home.</p> <p>Eventually my sisters and I understood she was no longer safe alone. She resisted any suggestion that she had a problem. \u201cI haven\u2019t got that dementia,\u201d she told me, sternly. But she agreed her memory was playing up. I used that to trick her into a GP appointment and referral to the memory clinic, where she was diagnosed, although no help was offered. We bullied her into twice-daily visits from a carer, who would sometimes arrive to find Mum missing. At Christmas at our house, she caught a virus and ended up in hospital, wandering the corridors at night. Staff refused to let her home without full-time care.</p> <p>Mum hated losing her independence, the same way she had fought us when we \u201cborrowed\u201d her car a couple of years earlier and did not return it. I asked the carers to let her go \u2013 but follow her. At the home, where we moved her a year later because of her night wandering, and to be closer to my sisters, only the corridor and patio garden are open to her. She is not deceived, though she can no longer tell you what\u2019s wrong. She is a \u201csundowner\u201d: after tea, she will walk and walk, up and down the corridor. The challenges of caring for people like her in the way she would want, if she were able to explain it, are great.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>There may be another answer. In a suburb of Amsterdam, Jannette Spiering sits at a cafe table in the sunshine, while women like Mum and Jean wander past. Spiering is the founder of the <a href=\"https://hogeweyk.dementiavillage.com/en/\" title=\"\">Hogeweyk</a>, a dementia village whose fame has travelled the world. She used to help run a conventional care home on the site, which was torn down, and believed she could do better.</p> <p>\u201cWe can try to come as close to normality as possible within the restrictions people with dementia have,\u201d she explains. \u201cThese are mostly that they can\u2019t make their own daily structure, and they don\u2019t know when to eat, how to cook, how to dress, how to communicate. If they choose to go outside on a day like this, that\u2019s not for us to decide. That\u2019s why the front door of every house is open. We have to take care, if it\u2019s cold, that people put a jacket on and that their shoelaces are tied so they won\u2019t fall over them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c79b13c3c88b744efa0ca02bc3c8325b2fb95a84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79b13c3c88b744efa0ca02bc3c8325b2fb95a84/0_306_5504_4575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Irene Wilding, 92, who has dementia, against a black background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irene Wilding, 92: \u2018If somebody told me I had dementia, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Hammond/Witness Change/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b571db84be8b8c24773b049809557e7d36830b56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b571db84be8b8c24773b049809557e7d36830b56/0_146_5504_5021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irene Wilding holds a photograph that hangs on her bedroom wall, in which she is pictured bottom right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"912\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irene, a former biology teacher, holds a photograph that hangs on her bedroom wall (she is bottom right)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Hammond/Witness Change/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOf course when people move in, they want to leave. I think I would, too, if I were locked up. But what I think is so lovely is you can go outside without someone watching or walking with you.\u201d</p> <p>This is not a village in the traditional English sense. The houses, restaurant and a small theatre form the Hogeweyk\u2019s perimeter wall. Look up and you see it is sandwiched between blocks of social housing flats. But there is space and sky. There are little gardens and a pond with statues of herons \u2013 and a real one that takes off as I walk by. The 23 houses, each for six or seven people, are different and separate, but joined as they might be on a terraced street. Outside are shady courtyards with wooden tables and chairs, flower tubs and trees.</p> <p>The Boulevard looks like a town street, but behind the shop fronts are clubs. There\u2019s the Mozart room, where classical music lovers meet. There\u2019s a painting and baking club, which Mum would enjoy, along with any sort of singing. She croons with Frank Sinatra and bops gently to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/15/observer-archive-rock-around-the-clock-16-september-1956\" title=\"\">Rock Around The Clock</a>, given the chance. At the Hogeweyk, families sign up their relatives for the clubs that will suit them, though too many activities can exhaust people, Spiering says.</p> <p>In the square, cafe tables are set beside a fountain. Off it is an arcade, with a waiter-service restaurant and a supermarket where the carers shop for each house. If residents wander out with a packet of cereal or a bottle of juice, it can be returned or paid for later. And there is a pub: there is no reason why people with dementia shouldn\u2019t enjoy a drink, although one daughter was scandalised that her non-drinking mother developed something of an advocaat habit. \u201cShe blamed us, but her mother just liked going there, attracted by the music or whatever,\u201d Spiering says. People can change for better or worse; some start to use bad language; inhibitions disappear.</p> <p>The Hogeweyk has its wanderers. A woman with Jean\u2019s tense face walks the village paths stiffly and finally passes through sliding doors into the reception area, ignoring the notice that says \u201cSorry, we\u2019re closed\u201d. Behind their glass screen, the staff watch. She gets halfway to the double doors on to the street, which will not open unless the receptionists press their button, stops abruptly as if she has remembered something, turns around and walks back into the village. One of more than 100 unpaid volunteers intercepts and takes her for a coffee, to distract her. \u201cThere is still some part of her mind that recognises this is not her home and she can\u2019t accept it. I think it is very sad,\u201d Spiering says. Some residents walk all day long, so there are distractions to encourage rest: a large TV screen with seats in the arcade, and cafe staff instructed to invite wanderers in for a drink.</p> <p>There is an element of the gilded cage of the 60s TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/17/features.theguardian\" title=\"\">The Prisoner</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/16/my-favourite-film-truman-show\" title=\"\">The Truman Show</a>, but while residents can\u2019t get out, the outside world is invited in. Young mothers and toddlers meet here weekly. Locals use the restaurant and go to the theatre.</p> <p>The Hogeweyk is not for the mildly ill. Everyone here has late-stage dementia. The average stay is 2.2 years, but some people die within a few weeks. Only three out of 169 residents are in bed all day, Spiering says, and these three are not segregated. \u201cWe put them in the living room with their bed, because they can still smell and hear what is going on and be part of it.\u201d There is no sign of the agitation or aggression that often signals distress in people with dementia, no howls of anguish through an upstairs window.</p> <p>Instead of severity of disease, as in the UK, the Hogeweyk allots residents to houses according to \u201clifestyle\u201d. It\u2019s not a class thing, Spiering says, nor anything to do with race: it\u2019s about familiarity with your surroundings. The families choose which lifestyle is the best match. There are seven \u2013 urban, artisan, Indonesian, homey, Goois [a wealthy area near Amsterdam which once had its own dialect], cultural and Christian. The urban houses are home to former city dwellers; the artisan houses to people who had a trade or craft. The homey houses are for people, like my mum, who were homemakers; those who loved theatre and cinema are in the cultural houses. The decor and food will be typical of those communities. Some will prefer meat and potatoes; others are mostly vegetarian. The music is folk in some houses but classical in others; the newspaper on the table will be a tabloid or broadsheet.</p> <p>Such segregation has its critics, but Spiering argues it is just what we all do for ourselves. We buy into certain lifestyles, or move to be part of a community we feel comfortable in. It doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t mix at the bingo group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6be246e9ac6450fc8d0ba0c93f9b33386e90fff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6be246e9ac6450fc8d0ba0c93f9b33386e90fff5/0_339_5504_4423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Kathleen Bishop, 81, who has dementia, against a black background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kathleen Bishop, 81: \u2018It\u2019s frustrating,\u2019 her husband, Allan, 84, says. \u2018We can\u2019t have proper conversations\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Hammond/Witness Change/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d2d43e46553029eb980531c3b93e7492dca5893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d2d43e46553029eb980531c3b93e7492dca5893/0_927_5504_3423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kathleen Bishop holds a photograph of her wedding day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"622\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kathleen, who used to teach shorthand and typing, holds a photograph of her wedding to Allan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Hammond/Witness Change/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There may be an element of fantasy, but it is no more than in more traditional dementia homes \u2013 such as my mother\u2019s, where people like Jean walk an endless loop of corridors decorated to look like a high street, with Singer sewing machines in alcoves and pictures of the Coronation to recall an epoch that is more vivid in the brain than the recent past. Reality is a tricky concept when it comes to dementia care, as Spiering points out. Some people want to go home, or wait for a visit from their long-dead partner. \u201cWe try to distract people, or we go along with them. We say, \u2018Is it OK if we go for lunch first?\u2019 You can say it\u2019s a lie or you can say it\u2019s not telling the whole truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Dementia used to be dismissed as normal memory loss, a side-effect of ageing. People tended to die of other causes, much younger, so it was less understood. When German psychiatrists <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/research_progress/milestones\" title=\"\">Alois Alzheimer and Emil Kraepelin</a> classified it as a disease in the early 20th century, they focused on younger patients. The deterioration of the brain in old age was still regarded as an inevitability.</p> <p>But by the mid-50s, US hospitals began to be overwhelmed by elderly dementia patients. Psychiatrists started to frame it as a psychosocial problem, finding that people from some backgrounds, with the same brain changes, did better than others. There were calls for programmes of activities to keep ageing minds stimulated. After Medicare, the US healthcare programme for the over-65s, was founded, people started to live even longer lives \u2013 and dementia soared. By 1980, everybody had heard of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Funds have been poured into research, mostly to find a pill to reverse it, without success.</p> <p>Patients like my mum, who get a diagnosis, are prescribed a single drug, supposed to help slow the disease, and sent home. There is nothing more the NHS can do, or afford. <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/conditions-illnesses/dementia/getting-care-and-support/\" title=\"\">Age UK</a> and Alzheimer\u2019s charities offer helpful advice, but you have to seek it out.</p> <p>A third of people with dementia are in care homes, which seek to calm and stimulate residents whose memory of the recent past goes first. The walls are lined with photographs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/charliechaplin\" title=\"\">Charlie Chaplin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/14/ava-gardner-screen-legend\" title=\"\">Ava Gardner</a>, the Queen as a girl. There are wartime singalongs. Living in the past is fine, as are white lies. We take Mum out for ice-cream and cakes at a garden centre, where last time she was overcome by the beauty of the flowers. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she kept saying. We stay in the present moment and talk about the mackerel sky and the planes she thinks are birds. We never talk about dementia.</p> <p>The truth used to be served up cold. \u201cReality orientation\u201d was developed in the late 50s, on the basis that exercising the memory would keep it functioning better for longer. Patients were trained to know the name of the place they were in, what month it was, who the prime minister was \u2013 but it was confrontational and insensitive. If people knew that it was Thursday and that they were widowed, it didn\u2019t make them happier.</p> <p>Instead the focus moved to cognitive stimulation \u2013 gentle activities to keep the brain going, such as word games, puzzles, music, and practical activities such as baking or indoor gardening. <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/CD005562/DEMENTIA_can-cognitive-stimulation-benefit-people-with-dementia\" title=\"\">A Cochrane medical review in 2012</a> found that 45-minute sessions at least twice a week helped people with mild to moderate dementia. There was some evidence that people were better able to reason, communicate and interact with others, and had a better quality of life. Such activities are now standard in dementia homes and day centres, along with dancing and gentle exercise and singing, all of which Mum loves.

At the heart of this is the photograph album \u2013 the concept that people have memories stored like photographs, recording feelings as well as facts, and that when the facts disappear, the feelings remain.</p> <p>Garner considers dementia a disability and has three golden rules: don\u2019t ask questions that will only cause distress when the person cannot find the answer; listen to the person with dementia and offer them only information that will make them feel better; and do not contradict. Her son-in-law, the psychologist Oliver James, wrote a book about the method, called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/contented-dementia.html\" title=\"\">Contented Dementia</a>, and many of its adherents are enthusiastic. But the <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Alzheimer\u2019s Society</a> is outright opposed, arguing that not asking questions deprives people of choice and control over their lives.</p> <p>The society is not enthusiastic about the idea of dementia villages, either. Dominic Carter, its senior policy officer, agrees that people have to be understood, offered activities and encouraged to eat and drink, but thinks it is \u201ca shame if we are willing to accept that the only way to do that is to segregate people and have them in environments that are so specifically focused\u201d.</p> <p>Instead the society wants to normalise dementia, with a flagship programme to accredit \u201cdementia-friendly communities\u201d \u2013 ordinary towns where the baker and hairdresser have been taught how to talk to people with dementia, and where local residents and bus drivers will be better able to see them safely home. So far, it has registered 400 communities, from Minehead to Billericay and beyond. Local Alzheimer\u2019s groups enlist shops, GP practices, libraries, churches, fire, police and social groups, whose members undertake training. There are also activities. Over one week in May, in Tamworth in the west Midlands, there was singing in the shopping centre and community knitting of forget-me-nots to aid the society\u2019s dementia campaign, which includes a call for a \u00a32.4bn government fund to help people with care costs.</p> <p>People with mild dementia will be safer and happier in a town that has more understanding, although the chances of getting lost in a city like Leeds must still be high. But as the disease progresses, the need for full-time care grows. While we might dream of Grandma sitting in a corner of the family home, watching life going on, being looked after by her children, that\u2019s a fantasy, says Professor <a href=\"https://juneandrews.net/about/\" title=\"\">June Andrews</a>, former director of Stirling\u2019s Dementia Services Development Centre in Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never been families taking care of their own,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been women. The extent to which it happens is related to the economic value of women.\u201d In countries where women are uneducated and unemployed, they do the caring, she says. \u201cAs soon as the daughter or daughter-in-law can get a job, they start importing a foreign domestic worker.\u201d And once those salaries rise out of reach, care homes spring up.</p> <p>In the UK, there will be <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-05/Dementia%20the%20true%20cost%20-%20Alzheimers%20Society%20report.pdf\" title=\"\">a shortage of 30,000 residential dementia places</a> by 2021; the costs remain high and the quality is sometimes questionable. The Care Quality Commission reports that more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45194202\" title=\"\">a fifth of services</a> either require improvement or are inadequate. Is the Hogeweyk model the answer? It has been controversial since its inception in 1993. Medical experts didn\u2019t like it, while other care home owners feared for their own business model. In the UK, the notion of a dementia village has been dismissed as gimmicky and too expensive \u2013 often by experts who have not visited. Although it is run as a not-for-profit, the cost for each resident is \u00a353,000-\u00a359,000 a year, paid for by the government. Local authorities in the UK pay about \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 for a residential care home place. </p> <p>Andrews is sceptical of the Hogeweyk\u2019s \u201clifestyles\u201d approach but says her own parents \u2013 a bus driver and a secretary \u2013 would never have been comfortable in a posh care home. \u201cHaving something that fits with what somebody is comfortable with is really important,\u201d she admits. But how would you categorise people in the UK, or find the volunteers the Hogeweyk relies on? \u201cThe bottom line is, who is going to be able to afford your model if it can only work with an army of volunteers? In the UK, hundreds of care homes are having to shut down because their buildings are not the right quality and they can\u2019t get the right staff.\u201d</p> <p>But New Zealand and Australia have similar villages, and <a href=\"https://www.ekhuft.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/news-centre/the-harmonia-village-at-dover/\" title=\"\">the first </a><a href=\"https://www.ekhuft.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/news-centre/the-harmonia-village-at-dover/\" title=\"\">to be modelled directly on the Hogeweyk</a> is likely to open in the UK later this year, in east Kent. Henry Quinn and Dr Phil Brighton, from East Kent Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust, tell me they were profoundly moved when they visited the Hogeweyk in 2015. \u201cWhat struck me most was when they said, \u2018The most important things are the front doors.\u2019 If you have a front door and it\u2019s raining, you can go out and get wet,\u201d Brighton says.</p> <p>Quinn went up on to the roof of Buckland hospital in Dover and spotted six semi-detached blocks of derelict houses. They got funding from Europe and are on track to open soon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gated community,\u201d Brighton explains. \u201cThere will be a boundary fence but not obtrusive or oppressive.\u201d There will be a hub where locals and residents with dementia can go for entertainment, as well as a cafe and a gym. The houses will have five bedrooms each and no locked doors. The team are exploring ideas with the local community, including keeping goats and forging links with a primary school, bringing children in for activities.</p> <p>If we let them, people with dementia take buses to the end of the line. One man, used to global travel, evaded his carer, travelled to the airport and hopped on a plane to the country where he grew up. People in residential homes used to be restrained, tied to chairs. That doesn\u2019t happen any more. In the dementia-friendly communities the Alzheimer\u2019s Society promotes, technology might allow more wandering. There are already GPS devices, informing relatives of people\u2019s whereabouts \u2013 whether they want it or not.</p> <p>And that is the hardest part: knowing what someone wants. We make decisions for those with dementia in the hope of protecting them. Sometimes, when you hear of a woman, such as a friend\u2019s mother, rocking in her seat, whispering, \u201cHelp me, help me\u201d, you have to wonder if we have got it right.</p> <p>My mum hates locked doors. When she lived in her flat, there wasn\u2019t a day when she didn\u2019t potter to the local shop or get the bus to town. It saddens me to see her wanderings reduced to a corridor and now, even though she is in a safe place with wonderful carers, she is starting to fall; last time I visited, I found her with bruises in another resident\u2019s room, as she frequently is. And for the first time, I did not get the sense that she knew who I was. </p> <p>For Spiering, caring for people with dementia is all about calculated risk \u2013 \u201caccepting frailty and that, in nursing homes, people are going to have falls, and are going to die, and we can\u2019t prevent that. But we can add quality of life. And it\u2019s not by locking them up and not seeing them as human any more.\u201d</p> <p>My mother is well looked after, by people who see her as human and lovable \u2013 but I am disturbed by her constant desire to leave. I want her to be safe, but even more than that, I don\u2019t want her to be unhappy. Most of all, I want her to live the life she wants, in the little time she has left. And it hurts that she can\u2019t tell me \u2013 even if she knows \u2013 what that is.</p> <p>\u2022 All the people photographed and interviewed either live or spend time at villages run by <a href=\"https://www.belong.org.uk/\">Belong</a>, a charitable UK organisation that provides care, housing and support for people with dementia.</p> <p>If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "She grips my hand and tows me behind her around the small courtyard garden, past the pretend bus stop and the red phone box with no dialling tone, down an alleyway of gravel that leads to a wooden gate. \u201cHere,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may be locked.\u201d It is, of course, securely padlocked. It\u2019s hidden away but still Mum has found it. I take her by the arm. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. We can get out the other way,\u201d I say, leading her inside, through the chintzy cafe where no money is exchanged, to the lift. I bleep my electronic visitor\u2019s pass. The doors to the outside world open for us. Mum walks through them, asking no questions, and admires the flowerbeds. Even though she cannot remember what happened 10 minutes ago or when she last ate, even though this once immaculate lady, left to herself, would head for the street in a petticoat and one earring (\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, does it,\u201d she said when I mentioned it), in spite of the holes in her mind that dementia has torn, the desire to go out appears hardwired. She found that gate, and then she remembered where she had found it. Earlier I watched as Jean, Mum\u2019s neighbour in the dementia home, walked up and down the corridor between her room and the communal area, tall and thin in her plaid skirt and jumper, the usual copy of the Times under her arm and anxiety on her face. Up and down. Back and forth. \u201cHas my mother come?\u201d she asks the carers. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid your family aren\u2019t visiting today,\u201d is the answer. Her mother died years ago. They sit her down, suggest television or a game, and she is instantly on her feet, asking the same question again. Dementia is the scourge of our age. We have become so good at patching people up bodily that for many, it is the mind that goes; dementia now kills more people than any other disease in England and Wales, accounting for 12.8% of deaths last year. In 2017 it affected an estimated 50 million people globally, with nearly a million in the UK; the numbers are expected to double every 20 years. David Cameron launched a research push for a cure in 2012, but one drug trial after another has collapsed, casting doubt on fundamental assumptions about what happens in the deteriorating brain. The central approach \u2013 targeting the buildup of amyloid plaques \u2013 appears to be going nowhere much. Meanwhile, less attention is being paid to how we care for those whose minds are irretrievably unravelling, to where and how they should live. Most people in care homes \u2013 70% \u2013 now have dementia. It may be best for many to stay at home as long as possible \u2013 but that means 24-hour care. The distinction between day and night can disappear. One of the first warning signs my three sisters and I had came when Mum started annoying the neighbours in her block of flats, pressing doorbells to be let back in at 5am. Then there were the parcels. I drove her home one day, to find a large brown box outside the door. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said, in genuine distress. \u201cNot another one.\u201d It contained what she and I would both have called quack remedies for ageing: potions and pills, and a Christmas cracker trinket of a bracelet. Inside was an invoice, paid on her credit card, for over \u00a3100. She had not ordered or paid for it, she insisted. And there were others. She had a cupboard full of expensive soaps and knick-knacks \u2013 a \u201csound amplifier\u201d for \u00a330 (there is nothing wrong with her hearing), a \u201ccabbage detox\u201d for \u00a320. It had all been sent by two companies at the same address in France. I was livid. How dare they take advantage of her? But I now think she started it, sending off magazine coupons for hand lotion, though I know they got her to order more junk thereafter. It\u2019s odd how the signals are there, but you don\u2019t see them. The flat smelling of burnt toast. I bought a new toaster. Her empty purse when she went out for coffee with friends. They paid. Her frequent trips in person to the bank. It didn\u2019t occur to me that she no longer knew her pin number. The huge bills she was running up for newspaper delivery. The shopkeeper kindly said nothing. The frightening times I called in the evening, when it was dark, and there was no reply. Finally she would answer, out of breath. She had taken the wrong bus. One time she said a nice man had driven her home. Eventually my sisters and I understood she was no longer safe alone. She resisted any suggestion that she had a problem. \u201cI haven\u2019t got that dementia,\u201d she told me, sternly. But she agreed her memory was playing up. I used that to trick her into a GP appointment and referral to the memory clinic, where she was diagnosed, although no help was offered. We bullied her into twice-daily visits from a carer, who would sometimes arrive to find Mum missing. At Christmas at our house, she caught a virus and ended up in hospital, wandering the corridors at night. Staff refused to let her home without full-time care. Mum hated losing her independence, the same way she had fought us when we \u201cborrowed\u201d her car a couple of years earlier and did not return it. I asked the carers to let her go \u2013 but follow her. At the home, where we moved her a year later because of her night wandering, and to be closer to my sisters, only the corridor and patio garden are open to her. She is not deceived, though she can no longer tell you what\u2019s wrong. She is a \u201csundowner\u201d: after tea, she will walk and walk, up and down the corridor. The challenges of caring for people like her in the way she would want, if she were able to explain it, are great. \u2022\u2022\u2022 There may be another answer. In a suburb of Amsterdam, Jannette Spiering sits at a cafe table in the sunshine, while women like Mum and Jean wander past. Spiering is the founder of the Hogeweyk, a dementia village whose fame has travelled the world. She used to help run a conventional care home on the site, which was torn down, and believed she could do better. \u201cWe can try to come as close to normality as possible within the restrictions people with dementia have,\u201d she explains. \u201cThese are mostly that they can\u2019t make their own daily structure, and they don\u2019t know when to eat, how to cook, how to dress, how to communicate. If they choose to go outside on a day like this, that\u2019s not for us to decide. That\u2019s why the front door of every house is open. We have to take care, if it\u2019s cold, that people put a jacket on and that their shoelaces are tied so they won\u2019t fall over them. \u201cOf course when people move in, they want to leave. I think I would, too, if I were locked up. But what I think is so lovely is you can go outside without someone watching or walking with you.\u201d This is not a village in the traditional English sense. The houses, restaurant and a small theatre form the Hogeweyk\u2019s perimeter wall. Look up and you see it is sandwiched between blocks of social housing flats. But there is space and sky. There are little gardens and a pond with statues of herons \u2013 and a real one that takes off as I walk by. The 23 houses, each for six or seven people, are different and separate, but joined as they might be on a terraced street. Outside are shady courtyards with wooden tables and chairs, flower tubs and trees. The Boulevard looks like a town street, but behind the shop fronts are clubs. There\u2019s the Mozart room, where classical music lovers meet. There\u2019s a painting and baking club, which Mum would enjoy, along with any sort of singing. She croons with Frank Sinatra and bops gently to Rock Around The Clock, given the chance. At the Hogeweyk, families sign up their relatives for the clubs that will suit them, though too many activities can exhaust people, Spiering says. In the square, cafe tables are set beside a fountain. Off it is an arcade, with a waiter-service restaurant and a supermarket where the carers shop for each house. If residents wander out with a packet of cereal or a bottle of juice, it can be returned or paid for later. And there is a pub: there is no reason why people with dementia shouldn\u2019t enjoy a drink, although one daughter was scandalised that her non-drinking mother developed something of an advocaat habit. \u201cShe blamed us, but her mother just liked going there, attracted by the music or whatever,\u201d Spiering says. People can change for better or worse; some start to use bad language; inhibitions disappear. The Hogeweyk has its wanderers. A woman with Jean\u2019s tense face walks the village paths stiffly and finally passes through sliding doors into the reception area, ignoring the notice that says \u201cSorry, we\u2019re closed\u201d. Behind their glass screen, the staff watch. She gets halfway to the double doors on to the street, which will not open unless the receptionists press their button, stops abruptly as if she has remembered something, turns around and walks back into the village. One of more than 100 unpaid volunteers intercepts and takes her for a coffee, to distract her. \u201cThere is still some part of her mind that recognises this is not her home and she can\u2019t accept it. I think it is very sad,\u201d Spiering says. Some residents walk all day long, so there are distractions to encourage rest: a large TV screen with seats in the arcade, and cafe staff instructed to invite wanderers in for a drink. There is an element of the gilded cage of the 60s TV series The Prisoner, or The Truman Show, but while residents can\u2019t get out, the outside world is invited in. Young mothers and toddlers meet here weekly. Locals use the restaurant and go to the theatre. The Hogeweyk is not for the mildly ill. Everyone here has late-stage dementia. The average stay is 2.2 years, but some people die within a few weeks. Only three out of 169 residents are in bed all day, Spiering says, and these three are not segregated. \u201cWe put them in the living room with their bed, because they can still smell and hear what is going on and be part of it.\u201d There is no sign of the agitation or aggression that often signals distress in people with dementia, no howls of anguish through an upstairs window. Instead of severity of disease, as in the UK, the Hogeweyk allots residents to houses according to \u201clifestyle\u201d. It\u2019s not a class thing, Spiering says, nor anything to do with race: it\u2019s about familiarity with your surroundings. The families choose which lifestyle is the best match. There are seven \u2013 urban, artisan, Indonesian, homey, Goois [a wealthy area near Amsterdam which once had its own dialect], cultural and Christian. The urban houses are home to former city dwellers; the artisan houses to people who had a trade or craft. The homey houses are for people, like my mum, who were homemakers; those who loved theatre and cinema are in the cultural houses. The decor and food will be typical of those communities. Some will prefer meat and potatoes; others are mostly vegetarian. The music is folk in some houses but classical in others; the newspaper on the table will be a tabloid or broadsheet. Such segregation has its critics, but Spiering argues it is just what we all do for ourselves. We buy into certain lifestyles, or move to be part of a community we feel comfortable in. It doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t mix at the bingo group. There may be an element of fantasy, but it is no more than in more traditional dementia homes \u2013 such as my mother\u2019s, where people like Jean walk an endless loop of corridors decorated to look like a high street, with Singer sewing machines in alcoves and pictures of the Coronation to recall an epoch that is more vivid in the brain than the recent past. Reality is a tricky concept when it comes to dementia care, as Spiering points out. Some people want to go home, or wait for a visit from their long-dead partner. \u201cWe try to distract people, or we go along with them. We say, \u2018Is it OK if we go for lunch first?\u2019 You can say it\u2019s a lie or you can say it\u2019s not telling the whole truth.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Dementia used to be dismissed as normal memory loss, a side-effect of ageing. People tended to die of other causes, much younger, so it was less understood. When German psychiatrists Alois Alzheimer and Emil Kraepelin classified it as a disease in the early 20th century, they focused on younger patients. The deterioration of the brain in old age was still regarded as an inevitability. But by the mid-50s, US hospitals began to be overwhelmed by elderly dementia patients. Psychiatrists started to frame it as a psychosocial problem, finding that people from some backgrounds, with the same brain changes, did better than others. There were calls for programmes of activities to keep ageing minds stimulated. After Medicare, the US healthcare programme for the over-65s, was founded, people started to live even longer lives \u2013 and dementia soared. By 1980, everybody had heard of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Funds have been poured into research, mostly to find a pill to reverse it, without success. Patients like my mum, who get a diagnosis, are prescribed a single drug, supposed to help slow the disease, and sent home. There is nothing more the NHS can do, or afford. Age UK and Alzheimer\u2019s charities offer helpful advice, but you have to seek it out. A third of people with dementia are in care homes, which seek to calm and stimulate residents whose memory of the recent past goes first. The walls are lined with photographs of Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, the Queen as a girl. There are wartime singalongs. Living in the past is fine, as are white lies. We take Mum out for ice-cream and cakes at a garden centre, where last time she was overcome by the beauty of the flowers. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she kept saying. We stay in the present moment and talk about the mackerel sky and the planes she thinks are birds. We never talk about dementia. The truth used to be served up cold. \u201cReality orientation\u201d was developed in the late 50s, on the basis that exercising the memory would keep it functioning better for longer. Patients were trained to know the name of the place they were in, what month it was, who the prime minister was \u2013 but it was confrontational and insensitive. If people knew that it was Thursday and that they were widowed, it didn\u2019t make them happier. Instead the focus moved to cognitive stimulation \u2013 gentle activities to keep the brain going, such as word games, puzzles, music, and practical activities such as baking or indoor gardening. A Cochrane medical review in 2012 found that 45-minute sessions at least twice a week helped people with mild to moderate dementia. There was some evidence that people were better able to reason, communicate and interact with others, and had a better quality of life. Such activities are now standard in dementia homes and day centres, along with dancing and gentle exercise and singing, all of which Mum loves. And how else would she spend her time? There are other theories. Penny Garner in Oxfordshire, whose mother had dementia, devised Specal (originally an acronym for specialised early care for Alzheimer\u2019s) to help families and carers communicate with a relative who has dementia. At the heart of this is the photograph album \u2013 the concept that people have memories stored like photographs, recording feelings as well as facts, and that when the facts disappear, the feelings remain. Garner considers dementia a disability and has three golden rules: don\u2019t ask questions that will only cause distress when the person cannot find the answer; listen to the person with dementia and offer them only information that will make them feel better; and do not contradict. Her son-in-law, the psychologist Oliver James, wrote a book about the method, called Contented Dementia, and many of its adherents are enthusiastic. But the Alzheimer\u2019s Society is outright opposed, arguing that not asking questions deprives people of choice and control over their lives. The society is not enthusiastic about the idea of dementia villages, either. Dominic Carter, its senior policy officer, agrees that people have to be understood, offered activities and encouraged to eat and drink, but thinks it is \u201ca shame if we are willing to accept that the only way to do that is to segregate people and have them in environments that are so specifically focused\u201d. Instead the society wants to normalise dementia, with a flagship programme to accredit \u201cdementia-friendly communities\u201d \u2013 ordinary towns where the baker and hairdresser have been taught how to talk to people with dementia, and where local residents and bus drivers will be better able to see them safely home. So far, it has registered 400 communities, from Minehead to Billericay and beyond. Local Alzheimer\u2019s groups enlist shops, GP practices, libraries, churches, fire, police and social groups, whose members undertake training. There are also activities. Over one week in May, in Tamworth in the west Midlands, there was singing in the shopping centre and community knitting of forget-me-nots to aid the society\u2019s dementia campaign, which includes a call for a \u00a32.4bn government fund to help people with care costs. People with mild dementia will be safer and happier in a town that has more understanding, although the chances of getting lost in a city like Leeds must still be high. But as the disease progresses, the need for full-time care grows. While we might dream of Grandma sitting in a corner of the family home, watching life going on, being looked after by her children, that\u2019s a fantasy, says Professor June Andrews, former director of Stirling\u2019s Dementia Services Development Centre in Scotland. \u201cIt\u2019s never been families taking care of their own,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been women. The extent to which it happens is related to the economic value of women.\u201d In countries where women are uneducated and unemployed, they do the caring, she says. \u201cAs soon as the daughter or daughter-in-law can get a job, they start importing a foreign domestic worker.\u201d And once those salaries rise out of reach, care homes spring up. In the UK, there will be a shortage of 30,000 residential dementia places by 2021; the costs remain high and the quality is sometimes questionable. The Care Quality Commission reports that more than a fifth of services either require improvement or are inadequate. Is the Hogeweyk model the answer? It has been controversial since its inception in 1993. Medical experts didn\u2019t like it, while other care home owners feared for their own business model. In the UK, the notion of a dementia village has been dismissed as gimmicky and too expensive \u2013 often by experts who have not visited. Although it is run as a not-for-profit, the cost for each resident is \u00a353,000-\u00a359,000 a year, paid for by the government. Local authorities in the UK pay about \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 for a residential care home place. Andrews is sceptical of the Hogeweyk\u2019s \u201clifestyles\u201d approach but says her own parents \u2013 a bus driver and a secretary \u2013 would never have been comfortable in a posh care home. \u201cHaving something that fits with what somebody is comfortable with is really important,\u201d she admits. But how would you categorise people in the UK, or find the volunteers the Hogeweyk relies on? \u201cThe bottom line is, who is going to be able to afford your model if it can only work with an army of volunteers? In the UK, hundreds of care homes are having to shut down because their buildings are not the right quality and they can\u2019t get the right staff.\u201d But New Zealand and Australia have similar villages, and the first to be modelled directly on the Hogeweyk is likely to open in the UK later this year, in east Kent. Henry Quinn and Dr Phil Brighton, from East Kent Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust, tell me they were profoundly moved when they visited the Hogeweyk in 2015. \u201cWhat struck me most was when they said, \u2018The most important things are the front doors.\u2019 If you have a front door and it\u2019s raining, you can go out and get wet,\u201d Brighton says. Quinn went up on to the roof of Buckland hospital in Dover and spotted six semi-detached blocks of derelict houses. They got funding from Europe and are on track to open soon. \u201cIt\u2019s a gated community,\u201d Brighton explains. \u201cThere will be a boundary fence but not obtrusive or oppressive.\u201d There will be a hub where locals and residents with dementia can go for entertainment, as well as a cafe and a gym. The houses will have five bedrooms each and no locked doors. The team are exploring ideas with the local community, including keeping goats and forging links with a primary school, bringing children in for activities. If we let them, people with dementia take buses to the end of the line. One man, used to global travel, evaded his carer, travelled to the airport and hopped on a plane to the country where he grew up. People in residential homes used to be restrained, tied to chairs. That doesn\u2019t happen any more. In the dementia-friendly communities the Alzheimer\u2019s Society promotes, technology might allow more wandering. There are already GPS devices, informing relatives of people\u2019s whereabouts \u2013 whether they want it or not. And that is the hardest part: knowing what someone wants. We make decisions for those with dementia in the hope of protecting them. Sometimes, when you hear of a woman, such as a friend\u2019s mother, rocking in her seat, whispering, \u201cHelp me, help me\u201d, you have to wonder if we have got it right. My mum hates locked doors. When she lived in her flat, there wasn\u2019t a day when she didn\u2019t potter to the local shop or get the bus to town. It saddens me to see her wanderings reduced to a corridor and now, even though she is in a safe place with wonderful carers, she is starting to fall; last time I visited, I found her with bruises in another resident\u2019s room, as she frequently is. And for the first time, I did not get the sense that she knew who I was. For Spiering, caring for people with dementia is all about calculated risk \u2013 \u201caccepting frailty and that, in nursing homes, people are going to have falls, and are going to die, and we can\u2019t prevent that. But we can add quality of life. And it\u2019s not by locking them up and not seeing them as human any more.\u201d My mother is well looked after, by people who see her as human and lovable \u2013 but I am disturbed by her constant desire to leave. I want her to be safe, but even more than that, I don\u2019t want her to be unhappy. Most of all, I want her to live the life she wants, in the little time she has left. And it hurts that she can\u2019t tell me \u2013 even if she knows \u2013 what that is. \u2022 All the people photographed and interviewed either live or spend time at villages run by Belong, a charitable UK organisation that provides care, housing and support for people with dementia.

Formerly the gardener\u2019s residence, Welbeck Cottage has recently opened to guests, offering out-of-hours access to the estate\u2019s 300 acres of woods and parkland. It\u2019s a magical spot, with winding paths that lead through woods and across bridges to cascades and lakes that reflect the gold and red of the leafy landscape. Inside, the renovated cottage is warm and comfortable, with neutral colours, wooden floors and a twin and double bedroom. Beyond the estate, beautiful Ashdown forest is 15 minutes away for more leaf peeping. \u2022 Sleeps four, from \u00a3357 for three nights, nationaltrust.org.uk/holidays Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire The second-largest crown forest in England after the New Forest (and once a royal hunting ground), the Forest of Dean has magical expanses of wild, ancient woodland. The Speech House Hotel is a 17th-century hideaway with 35 bedrooms (some with four-posters) and two restaurants. Forest walking trails start on the doorstep, it\u2019s next to the Cyril Hart Arboretum, and the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail is close by, with art works hidden among the trees. The local tourist board has devised a Leaf Peeping drive guide, listing the hotspots for autumn foliage, while nature lovers can book wildlife \u201cdetective\u201d Ed Drewitt for private safaris (up to six people, \u00a3100 for two hours or \u00a3200 full day). \u2022 Doubles from \u00a357 room only, two-night Autumn Leaves Explorer package from \u00a3278 for two for half-board plus packed lunch or cream tea, thespeechhouse.co.uk The Lizard, Cornwall Built in 1840, Frenchman\u2019s Creek is a secluded cottage surrounded by dense woods, near the Helford River estuary on the Lizard peninsula. It has been a source of literary inspiration for several former guests, not least Daphne du Maurier, who named one of her novels after the place. Later tenants were Maria Pendragon and Clara Vyvyan: the latter describes the cottage in her book The Helford River. \u201cOften, instead of reading, I would sit gazing out of the window at that wall of trees rising to the sky and feeling the quiet of that place as if it were soft music.\u201d The two-bedroom hideaway can be reached by boat at high tide, or by foot along a path. \u2022 Sleeps four, from \u00a3439 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.uk National Forest, East Midlands The 200-square-mile National Forest is the biggest environment-led regeneration project in the country: by this autumn, 9m trees will have been planted in less than 30 years, on land once scarred by mining and industry.

Great walks are guaranteed on the 75-mile National Forest Way, which is divided into 12 sections and runs from the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire to Beacon Hill Country Park in Leicestershire. \u2022 From \u00a380 for a double or \u00a3100 for a family room sleeping four, sawdays.co.uk New Forest, Hampshire The New Forest is at its most picturesque in autumn, when ancient oak, beech and sweet chestnut trees turn the landscape gold and red, and the annual pannage (when pigs are released to eat acorns) adds to the ambiance. Treetops is a three-bedroom, contemporary cottage in woods on the banks of the Beaulieu River, with a deck for alfresco dining and a woodburner inside.

Close by, Fairy Glen gorge will delight children, Swallow Falls are the highest waterfalls in Wales, and there are several circular rambles on the doorstep, plus plenty of hiking throughout the park. \u2022 Cottages sleep two, three and four, from \u00a3259 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.uk North Wessex Downs, Hampshire In private woodland on the Hampshire-Berkshire border, Hollington Park Glamping has two vintage-style cabins that are ideal for family campers. It\u2019s a small, dog-friendly site that\u2019s also home to a rabbit, several Indian Runner ducks, chickens, two miniature dachshunds and a great dane, who all enjoy a meet and greet with visitors.

Built in 1835, it had been engulfed by the forest (only the chimneys could be spotted, poking through the trees) until its recent restoration. The rustic charm remains: it\u2019s off-grid, with no wifi or phone signal, woodburners keep it cosy, water comes from the original spring well, and bathroom facilities are in a wooden out-house. Soak up the sounds of the forest from the hot tub; look out for deer, owls and badgers; and hike on the extensive network of woodland trails around the estate and into the Wye Valley. \u2022 Sleeps four in two bedrooms, three-night stays from \u00a3615, qualityunearthed.co.uk River Nene, Cambridgeshire Overlooking a Forestry Commission poplar plantation in the grounds of Island House, The Arc is a spacious but cosy cabin surrounded by nature. Red kites can be seen soaring around the woods, which are also home to otters, muntjacs, herons, kingfishers, badgers, swans and more. Kenneth Grahame is said to have stayed in the main house and could well have drawn inspiration for The Wind in The Willows from this peaceful corner near the River Nene. Days spent walking on the Elton-Nassington-Fotheringhay loop or at Ferry Meadows can be followed by nights in the colourful open-plan space, with its vintage furniture, packed bookshelves and games by the woodburner. \u2022 Sleeps four, three-night weekend from \u00a3450, canopyandstars.co.uk Tamar Valley, Cornwall Steeped in the history of England\u2019s mining industry, Danescombe Mine, near Calstock, was in operation throughout the 19th century, after which it lay abandoned until the 1970s, when it was restored by the Landmark Trust.

A progressive three-year-old, like the horse that won this race last year for the same trainer and jockey, he looked well treated when runner-up on his handicap debut recently.</p> \n<p>That was his first run after a gelding operation and a break since May, suggesting Gosden may have had this target in mind for some time.

The progressive colt has more to offer and his stamina could count for plenty here.</p> \n<p><strong>2.10 Chester </strong>Haydock\u2019s card having been lost to waterlogging, ITV4 will now show this and a later race from Chester. On a rating that has dropped 24lb in two years, <strong>Tangled </strong>has become dangerously well handicapped and might be able to show it on this drop in class. He was taken off his feet over six furlongs last time but this seven should suit better on his third run for the in-form Karen Tutty.</p> \n<p><strong>2.25 Newmarket</strong> Another compliment was paid to <strong>Raffle Prize</strong> on Friday when Daahyeh, who chased her home in July, won the Rockfel. Her neck second in the Prix Morny reads very well in this company and the stable remains in fine form. Tropbeau perhaps needed more rain.</p> \n<p><strong>3.00 Newmarket</strong> A Middle Park of extraordinary depth provides a contest to savour, in which <strong>Siskin</strong>\u2019s turn of foot may prove the deciding factor. From the Ger Lyons stable that won the Cheveley Park on this card some years ago, he was brave to win the Phoenix on unsuitably soft ground but should be more comfortable on this surface.

      "bodyText": "Fans of the John Gosden/Frankie Dettori combination endured a frustrating Friday but Lord North (3.40) gives them every chance of a better Saturday at around 8-1 in the Cambridgeshire at Newmarket. A progressive three-year-old, like the horse that won this race last year for the same trainer and jockey, he looked well treated when runner-up on his handicap debut recently. That was his first run after a gelding operation and a break since May, suggesting Gosden may have had this target in mind for some time. The 33-1 about the doughty Baltic Baron has some each-way appeal. 1.50 Newmarket Kameko will be a warm order for this Royal Lodge but a value alternative may be Pyledriver, who surprised connections with a strong-finishing win at Haydock last time. The progressive colt has more to offer and his stamina could count for plenty here. 2.10 Chester Haydock\u2019s card having been lost to waterlogging, ITV4 will now show this and a later race from Chester. On a rating that has dropped 24lb in two years, Tangled has become dangerously well handicapped and might be able to show it on this drop in class. He was taken off his feet over six furlongs last time but this seven should suit better on his third run for the in-form Karen Tutty. 2.25 Newmarket Another compliment was paid to Raffle Prize on Friday when Daahyeh, who chased her home in July, won the Rockfel. Her neck second in the Prix Morny reads very well in this company and the stable remains in fine form. Tropbeau perhaps needed more rain. 3.00 Newmarket A Middle Park of extraordinary depth provides a contest to savour, in which Siskin\u2019s turn of foot may prove the deciding factor. From the Ger Lyons stable that won the Cheveley Park on this card some years ago, he was brave to win the Phoenix on unsuitably soft ground but should be more comfortable on this surface. Mums Tipple is a very short price for a horse that has never raced in Group company. Earthlight is classy but might be at the stage where another furlong is a good idea. 3.20 Chester Having been gelded and given the summer off, Involved put up a much-improved performance to score over course and distance a fortnight ago, his first race on turf. The four-year-old has been lightly raced and should have more to offer, having been raised a modest 5lb.",

      "body": "<p>In 2001, the cartoonist Chris Ware\u2019s graphic novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/21/biography.highereducation\" title=\"\">Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</a></em> won the Guardian\u2019s first book award. It was the first time a comic book had won a major UK literary prize. Ware was in that respect, as in others, something of a trailblazer in showing how subtle and complex and serious graphic narratives could be \u2013 a first advance in their subsequent storming of mainstream literary culture.</p> <p><em>Rusty Brown</em>, Ware\u2019s first graphic novel since 2012\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/21/building-stories-chris-ware-review\" title=\"\">Building Stories</a></em>, is anchored by the inconsequential events of a single day in a school in Ware\u2019s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, in 1975. It tells the interwoven stories of the titular pre-teen bully magnet and a handful of characters with whom his life, however glancingly, intersects. As readers of Ware will have come to expect, it\u2019s mordantly melancholy and drawn and plotted with extraordinary precision.</p> <p>When he guest edited a comics issue for McSweeney\u2019s in 2004, Ware called comics \u201cnot a genre, but a developing language\u201d. Ahead of the publication of the print instalment of <em>Rusty Brown</em>, we discussed his way of working \u2013 and where that developing language is now.</p> <p><strong>Sam Leith:</strong><em> Rusty Brown</em> collects a number of different storylines written over a number of years. How much do you think of it as a coherent single work?</p> <p><strong>Chris Ware: </strong>I\u2019d always planned it as one volume, but my irresponsible writing methods got out of hand and I decided that rather than produce a book that would be too heavy to hold, it was better to split it into two books. Besides, paper may no longer exist when I finally get done with the thing, though at least I\u2019ll know half of it will actually physically exist somewhere for a little while. Sprawl and complexity are features of my favourite books, from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/war-and-peace-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">War and Peace</a></em> to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/30/subversive-queer-and-terrifyingly-relevant-six-reasons-why-moby-dick-is-the-novel-for-our-times\" title=\"\">Moby-Dick</a></em> to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/13/is-james-joyce-ulysses-the-hardest-novel-to-finish\" title=\"\">Ulysses</a></em>, and I\u2019m aiming for a similar end \u2013 albeit with thousands of little colour pictures instead of just words. </p> <p><strong>SL:</strong> How do the characters in <em>Rusty Brown</em> and their universe relate to the worlds of your other work? Is there a sort of Ware-verse in which they cohabit?</p> <p><strong>CW: </strong>There is a tip-off in the book that it all connects to <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em>, and though it\u2019s not apparent yet, also to both <em>Building Stories</em> and two other books on which I\u2019ve been slowly toiling. This is all very inconsequential to the turning of the planet, however.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The election of Trump has made us aware of the fragility of virtue versus the blunt force of decep\u00adtion and domination</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>SL: </strong>You \u2013 or someone with your name \u2013 figures in the book as a character (though, at the time in which the book is set, I\u2019m guessing you would have been closer to Rusty\u2019s age than his). How autobiographical is the book and in which way? What does it do to introduce \u201cChris Ware\u201d as a character?</p> <p><strong>CW:</strong> Well, I needed a jerk and I was available. To portray is not to endorse, of course, though on my private novelistic spectrum of human loathsomeness, the character is probably the most immoral and self\u2011deceiving of anyone in the book, growing out of my own sublimated venal impulses and the imaginings of those in others. For the reader as well as the artist, comics are already something of a paper mirror. So to have a horrible person staring back at me while I draw him, who looks like me but isn\u2019t, serves as a useful psychological experiment. It is all in the service of trying to understand the world and, most importantly, to be a better person.</p> <p>Every generation has its immoralities that culture and custom somehow cushion, and we\u2019re seeing a much-overdue reckoning of that now; if there\u2019s any shred of inadvertent good to the election of Donald Trump, it\u2019s that he has made us all keenly aware of the fragility of virtue versus the blunt force of deception and domination. It takes considerable effort to be good and almost none to be bad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb14a74155d8bb88ae6faa17e0e12746a77bfba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb14a74155d8bb88ae6faa17e0e12746a77bfba7/146_138_2697_2018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail from Rusty Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from Rusty Brown by Chris Ware.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ware</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>SL: </strong>How do you feel towards your characters? Is to understand all to forgive all?</p> <p><strong>CW: </strong>I try, but don\u2019t always succeed, to somehow love them all, even if that sounds crazy. I genuinely believe there\u2019s a redeeming impulse of goodness in everyone which is heightened by sympathy, if not by art, and in my own mind the two should be synonymous as much as is possible.</p> <p><strong>SL: </strong>Your persona as you present it to readers is extremely shy, and self-deprecating to a fault. Does the fact that your work has been buried under a mountain of prizes and plaudits make it, even just a bit, hard to sustain that?</p> <p><strong>CW: </strong>Maybe it seems disingenuous after receiving such kind words, but it sure doesn\u2019t feel that way in my skull. I kind of envy writers and creators who seem to suffer from no self-doubts, but I\u2019ve also come to decide they might also be a little nutty and that, regardless, we\u2019re probably pretty much pre-wired in this regard anyway; ie, thick skins don\u2019t seem to grow over thin ones. Ultimately, though, my own comfort doesn\u2019t matter. As an art of reproduction, comics<strong> </strong>always returns to its status as trash, which I think is key to its being seen clearly and read critically; it has none of the innate prestige of writing or painting and so has to earn its stature on its own terms, every time.</p> <p><strong>SL: </strong>Can you say what the germ of this \u2013 or any of your cartoons \u2013 is? Do you start with a character sketch, or a situation, or a mood? And how do you plan out a comic story? You\u2019re so meticulous and exact in terms of the design of pages and spreads, I\u2019m curious as to how you mesh spatial thinking and narrative thinking.</p> <p><strong>CW: </strong>The apparent meticulousness of my stuff only comes from trying to provide as clear as possible reading experience out of the tangled and knotted experience of life as I\u2019ve come to know it. I have sheaves of notes and ideas of where the story is going to go \u2013 or worse, what I might think it\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d \u2013 nearly all of which get thrown out the moment I sit down to draw. If I pay attention to what occurs to me as my drawings appear on the page, however, it will all eventually connect in ways that would otherwise be impossible to predict or control. I believe it\u2019s the role of the artist not to impose a structure on one\u2019s art but to let the structure build itself \u2013 and it always will, if you let it.</p> <p>The book is largely set in my own memories of the parochial school I attended as a kid, which in my early adulthood I realised I\u2019d spent more time in than at home.

      "bodyText": "In 2001, the cartoonist Chris Ware\u2019s graphic novel Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth won the Guardian\u2019s first book award. It was the first time a comic book had won a major UK literary prize. Ware was in that respect, as in others, something of a trailblazer in showing how subtle and complex and serious graphic narratives could be \u2013 a first advance in their subsequent storming of mainstream literary culture. Rusty Brown, Ware\u2019s first graphic novel since 2012\u2019s Building Stories, is anchored by the inconsequential events of a single day in a school in Ware\u2019s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, in 1975. It tells the interwoven stories of the titular pre-teen bully magnet and a handful of characters with whom his life, however glancingly, intersects. As readers of Ware will have come to expect, it\u2019s mordantly melancholy and drawn and plotted with extraordinary precision. When he guest edited a comics issue for McSweeney\u2019s in 2004, Ware called comics \u201cnot a genre, but a developing language\u201d. Ahead of the publication of the print instalment of Rusty Brown, we discussed his way of working \u2013 and where that developing language is now. Sam Leith: Rusty Brown collects a number of different storylines written over a number of years. How much do you think of it as a coherent single work? Chris Ware: I\u2019d always planned it as one volume, but my irresponsible writing methods got out of hand and I decided that rather than produce a book that would be too heavy to hold, it was better to split it into two books. Besides, paper may no longer exist when I finally get done with the thing, though at least I\u2019ll know half of it will actually physically exist somewhere for a little while. Sprawl and complexity are features of my favourite books, from War and Peace to Moby-Dick to Ulysses, and I\u2019m aiming for a similar end \u2013 albeit with thousands of little colour pictures instead of just words. SL: How do the characters in Rusty Brown and their universe relate to the worlds of your other work? Is there a sort of Ware-verse in which they cohabit? CW: There is a tip-off in the book that it all connects to Jimmy Corrigan, and though it\u2019s not apparent yet, also to both Building Stories and two other books on which I\u2019ve been slowly toiling. This is all very inconsequential to the turning of the planet, however. SL: You \u2013 or someone with your name \u2013 figures in the book as a character (though, at the time in which the book is set, I\u2019m guessing you would have been closer to Rusty\u2019s age than his). How autobiographical is the book and in which way? What does it do to introduce \u201cChris Ware\u201d as a character? CW: Well, I needed a jerk and I was available. To portray is not to endorse, of course, though on my private novelistic spectrum of human loathsomeness, the character is probably the most immoral and self\u2011deceiving of anyone in the book, growing out of my own sublimated venal impulses and the imaginings of those in others. For the reader as well as the artist, comics are already something of a paper mirror. So to have a horrible person staring back at me while I draw him, who looks like me but isn\u2019t, serves as a useful psychological experiment. It is all in the service of trying to understand the world and, most importantly, to be a better person. Every generation has its immoralities that culture and custom somehow cushion, and we\u2019re seeing a much-overdue reckoning of that now; if there\u2019s any shred of inadvertent good to the election of Donald Trump, it\u2019s that he has made us all keenly aware of the fragility of virtue versus the blunt force of deception and domination. It takes considerable effort to be good and almost none to be bad. SL: How do you feel towards your characters? Is to understand all to forgive all? CW: I try, but don\u2019t always succeed, to somehow love them all, even if that sounds crazy. I genuinely believe there\u2019s a redeeming impulse of goodness in everyone which is heightened by sympathy, if not by art, and in my own mind the two should be synonymous as much as is possible. SL: Your persona as you present it to readers is extremely shy, and self-deprecating to a fault. Does the fact that your work has been buried under a mountain of prizes and plaudits make it, even just a bit, hard to sustain that? CW: Maybe it seems disingenuous after receiving such kind words, but it sure doesn\u2019t feel that way in my skull. I kind of envy writers and creators who seem to suffer from no self-doubts, but I\u2019ve also come to decide they might also be a little nutty and that, regardless, we\u2019re probably pretty much pre-wired in this regard anyway; ie, thick skins don\u2019t seem to grow over thin ones. Ultimately, though, my own comfort doesn\u2019t matter. As an art of reproduction, comics always returns to its status as trash, which I think is key to its being seen clearly and read critically; it has none of the innate prestige of writing or painting and so has to earn its stature on its own terms, every time. SL: Can you say what the germ of this \u2013 or any of your cartoons \u2013 is? Do you start with a character sketch, or a situation, or a mood? And how do you plan out a comic story? You\u2019re so meticulous and exact in terms of the design of pages and spreads, I\u2019m curious as to how you mesh spatial thinking and narrative thinking. CW: The apparent meticulousness of my stuff only comes from trying to provide as clear as possible reading experience out of the tangled and knotted experience of life as I\u2019ve come to know it. I have sheaves of notes and ideas of where the story is going to go \u2013 or worse, what I might think it\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d \u2013 nearly all of which get thrown out the moment I sit down to draw. If I pay attention to what occurs to me as my drawings appear on the page, however, it will all eventually connect in ways that would otherwise be impossible to predict or control. I believe it\u2019s the role of the artist not to impose a structure on one\u2019s art but to let the structure build itself \u2013 and it always will, if you let it. The book is largely set in my own memories of the parochial school I attended as a kid, which in my early adulthood I realised I\u2019d spent more time in than at home. The rooms, hallways and kids were almost all certainly more familiar to me than my own family and house, and still reappear in my dreams, even if they\u2019re incongruously populated with the people and details of my life now. SL: Why the very very tiny panels and lettering? Is it a way of slowing the reader down? CW: I don\u2019t mean to strain the limits of legibility, but narratively it\u2019s a way of trying to get at the seemingly infinite tide pools of memory and detail that regularly open and close in our minds, as well as pointing to the ever-finer complexity of the universe as one looks at and into it. Also, I don\u2019t want the reader to feel as if I\u2019ve laid down on the job \u2013 and since the universe never disappoints in that regard, I shouldn\u2019t, either. SL: There\u2019s a dichotomy sometimes made between \u201cgrown-up comics\u201d and the superhero/funny-papers/genre type. Your work seems to be an example of the former that\u2019s very interested in the latter, as a fantasy contrast to the humiliating mundanity of ordinary life. Do you feel affectionate towards that sort of storytelling? What does that sort of fantasy offer? CW: As a kid I was made fun of for reading superhero comics, but once I grew up I lost all interest in them. Which is why I find it a little disquieting, though not necessarily surprising, that such stuff has become mainstream American culture, and one that adults now find a satisfying diversion. Then again, mythologies aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. For me, however, regular human life is already so extra strange, moving and complicated I\u2019m more than happy not plugging it into any amplification. SL: A big theme of your work seems to be human connection (and its failure). Is that why you weave stories in and out of each other? CW: We\u2019re all connected in ways we don\u2019t and can\u2019t ever completely understand. The chain of causality that links us from the subatomic level up through the sphere of thought and how that thought, though it apparently still arises from the interactions of particles, somehow also seems to have an effect on the physical world, is simply unfathomable in its complexity. I find this immense incomprehensibility greatly reassuring, especially its seeming meaninglessness. SL: You (or \u201cChris Ware\u201d) say in the book that the sense of \u201cweary dislocation\u201d we suffer comes from the thwarted desire to feel like a protagonist. How does that bear on your stuff?

But in another book with an embarrassing-to-say title, Moby-Dick is also not a protagonist but something else about which everyone else in it orbits; Rusty Brown is simply the loathed kid who happens to invisibly bind everyone in this random three-dimensional snapshot of a single day in 1975.

      "bodyText": "Mark your calendars, update your Google docs, check it off in your Notes app: 2019 is the year that rap has reached Peak Baby. Over the past few years, hip-hop has seen an influx of artists with the word \u201cbaby\u201d in their names. This year\u2019s biggest babies are DaBaby \u2013 whose album, Baby on Baby has the track Goin Baby \u2013 and Lil Baby, who raps \u201cwah wah wah, bitch I\u2019m the Baby\u201d on his Drake-featuring breakout hit Yes Indeed. Then there is Sada Baby, SahBabii, Baby Soulja, Baby Keem, Baby E and BBG Baby Joe. Female babies include BbyMutha, Baby Goth, Yung Baby Tate and Bali Baby. And don\u2019t forget the \u201cCash me outside\u201d meme turned quite good rapper Bhad Bhabie and the Putin-bothering Russian star Big Baby Tape. We officially reached peak baby on 17 July this year, when Lil Baby and DaBaby released a track called \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Baby, on which they rap: \u201cBaby hang with four or five killers / Baby got children / Baby probably still drug dealin\u2019\u201d. Can someone report this nursery to Ofsted? It is important to note, mainly in observance of child-labour laws, that none of these babies are actual infants. Atlanta\u2019s Lil Baby, 24, couldn\u2019t have written a track as good as Drip Too Hard if he was still in nappies, and the lyrics to 18-year-old Baby Keem\u2019s Orange Soda would get him sent to the naughty step for years. Twenty-year-old BBG Baby Joe\u2019s depiction of his home town of Baton Rouge in Letter to Boo would be very different if he\u2019d only experienced the city strapped into a Bugaboo. It could be argued that after decades of songs about murder, gang violence and rivalries, what rap needs is vulnerability, and the baby trend is a positive step towards this. But then you listen to DaBaby\u2019s Baby Sitter, where he claims: \u201cI\u2019m the type of Baby that\u2019s gon\u2019 fuck the babysitter\u201d. Mate: grow up. And while baby voice works on, say, Nicki Minaj\u2019s incredible verse on Kanye\u2019s Monster, Yung Baby Tate rapping: \u201cThis pussy juicy-juicy / Oh yummy, wanna do me?\u201d in a baby voice on Ashnikko\u2019s Stupid is just creepy. On the song Beckham, as well as drastically misunderstanding David Beckham\u2019s onfield tactics, Tate begs a man to \u201cbend me over like Beckham\u201d with a childish giggle.

      "body": "<p>I loved how spare those tables looked, the restraint and grace. What I find so particularly interesting is the sense of calm that pervades all things Japanese. On top of that, I am struck by how in Japan modernity mingles seamlessly with history. The Japanese manage to convey the sense that they are able to look both backwards to tradition and forwards to the unknown future with equal ease. This is quite a cultural accomplishment.</p> <p>In 1981 my interest for the Japanese aesthetic, fuelled by a steady diet of <a href=\"https://www.roningallery.com/artists/utamaro\" title=\"\">Utamaro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/28/akira-kurosawa-king-lear-story-ran-4k-restoration\" title=\"\">Kurosawa</a>, of old and new, went full-blown in one of my most iconic collections \u2013 an epic commercial fail, truth be told. Since then, my fascination with the country has grown steadily. Many of my collections have been influenced by Japan, from that 1981 collection to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/05/armani-dedicates-collection-japan\" title=\"\">Hommage au Japon</a>\u201d in 2011, which was an all-Japanese couture collection, from tables to chairs, lamps and ceramics. I cannot choose which is my favourite, though: would you choose one of your siblings over another? I feel a sense of continuity with this world. Looking at Japanese artefacts might help me create a new detail, opt for a texture or a shade. I never do that literally, however: I like nuance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66576f9884cdce6f5df98f3435c263e7f5fba60f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66576f9884cdce6f5df98f3435c263e7f5fba60f/0_0_2362_3543/667.jpg\" alt=\"Shelf life: a Japanese lacquer table in the Armani offices.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelf life: a Japanese lacquer table in the Armani offices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gionata Xerra</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I go to Japan I always visit the <a href=\"https://www.mori.art.museum/en/\" title=\"\">Mori Art Museum</a> \u2013 which showed the travelling retrospective of my work in 2005, organised by the Guggenheim. <a href=\"http://www.2121designsight.jp/en/\" title=\"\">21:21 Design Sight</a> is another place I really like, created by Issey Miyake, a Japanese designer I truly admire for his innovative and profoundly human touch. I like Le Corbusier\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2016/07/23/le-corbusier-national-museum-of-western-art-tokyo-japan-unesco-world-heritage-list/\" title=\"\">National Museum of Western Art</a> \u2013 it is the only building in east Asia by the French modernist master, impressive both inside and out.</p> <p>By contrast, and I know that it is a favourite tourist attraction, I am very fond of the 7th century <a href=\"https://tokyocheapo.com/entertainment/sensoji-temple-guide/\" title=\"\">Sens\u014d-ji Temple in Asakusa</a>, which is Tokyo\u2019s oldest temple, I believe. It\u2019s exactly what I imagined a Japanese temple to be like before I saw one in person \u2013 all ornately decorated wood and slightly curved, tiered roofs; and lots of red! As for food, I recall some restaurants in the small alleys in Shinjuku where I had some of the best Japanese food ever. These tiny streets, rammed with minute eateries that only seat a few people, are remarkable, unpretentious and authentic. Once, looking at a chef making sushi for me felt like watching an artist at work.</p> <p>In 2001, for the <a href=\"https://www.armanisilos.com/\" title=\"\">Armani/Teatro exhibition space</a> in Milan, one of my most ambitious projects, I collaborated with Japanese master architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/12/the-challenge-tadao-ando\" title=\"\">Tadao Ando</a>.

      "bodyText": "I loved how spare those tables looked, the restraint and grace. What I find so particularly interesting is the sense of calm that pervades all things Japanese. On top of that, I am struck by how in Japan modernity mingles seamlessly with history. The Japanese manage to convey the sense that they are able to look both backwards to tradition and forwards to the unknown future with equal ease. This is quite a cultural accomplishment. In 1981 my interest for the Japanese aesthetic, fuelled by a steady diet of Utamaro and Kurosawa, of old and new, went full-blown in one of my most iconic collections \u2013 an epic commercial fail, truth be told. Since then, my fascination with the country has grown steadily. Many of my collections have been influenced by Japan, from that 1981 collection to \u201cHommage au Japon\u201d in 2011, which was an all-Japanese couture collection, from tables to chairs, lamps and ceramics. I cannot choose which is my favourite, though: would you choose one of your siblings over another? I feel a sense of continuity with this world. Looking at Japanese artefacts might help me create a new detail, opt for a texture or a shade. I never do that literally, however: I like nuance. When I go to Japan I always visit the Mori Art Museum \u2013 which showed the travelling retrospective of my work in 2005, organised by the Guggenheim. 21:21 Design Sight is another place I really like, created by Issey Miyake, a Japanese designer I truly admire for his innovative and profoundly human touch. I like Le Corbusier\u2019s National Museum of Western Art \u2013 it is the only building in east Asia by the French modernist master, impressive both inside and out. By contrast, and I know that it is a favourite tourist attraction, I am very fond of the 7th century Sens\u014d-ji Temple in Asakusa, which is Tokyo\u2019s oldest temple, I believe. It\u2019s exactly what I imagined a Japanese temple to be like before I saw one in person \u2013 all ornately decorated wood and slightly curved, tiered roofs; and lots of red! As for food, I recall some restaurants in the small alleys in Shinjuku where I had some of the best Japanese food ever. These tiny streets, rammed with minute eateries that only seat a few people, are remarkable, unpretentious and authentic. Once, looking at a chef making sushi for me felt like watching an artist at work. In 2001, for the Armani/Teatro exhibition space in Milan, one of my most ambitious projects, I collaborated with Japanese master architect Tadao Ando. I first discovered his work in a book I was given as a gift. I was won over by the purity in his architecture, his meticulous use of materials and, above all, the dialogue between water and light, which reminds us that nature is never far away. I find this extremely telling of Japanese culture. I think Japanese design has evolved, while keeping its signature soulful minimalism. In fashion, the new generation of designers is pursuing a lively, almost chaotic aesthetic that is very far from the gloomy black of their predecessors. Japan moves fast, creatively and otherwise, but at the core always keeps its soul, and that is fascinating for me.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party\u2019s radical proposals to shake up England\u2019s schooling system has thrust educational debate into the spotlight, shattering the post-millennial political consensus of what\u2019s best for our children. A Labour government would dismantle the very foundations of the current education landscape \u2013 abandoning tests at the end of primary school, replacing the schools inspectorate, and abolishing private schools altogether. Labour claims it\u2019s the party fighting for social justice rather than social mobility. It is certainly offering a different vision to that of the Conservatives, who want to create more places at selective grammar schools. But how do these policies stack up against the hard evidence? What\u2019s undeniable is that we need to rethink the current approach to education. Amid stagnating social mobility, schools remain the great hope of levelling a grotesquely uneven playing field. But the achievement gap between poorer children and their better-off peers continues to be stark. Reviews of progress on narrowing the gap have adopted an increasingly futile tone. It\u2019s an impossible task for teachers. Classroom divides are driven by inequalities outside the school gates. It\u2019s an arms race that the wealthy are destined to win \u2013 just look at the boom in private tutoring.

Each nivolumab arm was compared with ipilimumab by itself, and was administered until the disease progressed or until any side effects became unacceptable.</p> <p>The best results were seen in the group who had the combination treatment, 52% of whom survived to five years or more. Most of those, 74%, were no longer receiving any treatment by that time.

But the researchers found that did not matter; even taking immunotherapy for a limited period appeared to kick-start the immune system into recognising and fighting the tumours. The survival rates among those who stopped were as good as in those who continued.</p> <p>For advanced melanoma, the standard course of treatment is two years, but some people may need much less, Larkin said.</p> <p>Pamela Smith, 67, joined the immunotherapy trial in January 2014, soon after discovering her melanoma had spread.</p> <p>\u201cIt was inoperable, so the trial was my only option,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d been having treatment every two weeks for about four months when I developed diarrhoea that was so bad I had to come off treatment. Amazingly, the first scan and every scan since has shown that in that relatively short time it worked. My tumour shrank to less than half its original size and it hasn\u2019t changed in five years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve not had any treatment since and I feel brilliant. At every appointment at the Royal Marsden, they ask how I feel on a scale of one to 100 and I answer 100. I feel well and very lucky to be alive.\u201d</p>",

Each nivolumab arm was compared with ipilimumab by itself, and was administered until the disease progressed or until any side effects became unacceptable. The best results were seen in the group who had the combination treatment, 52% of whom survived to five years or more. Most of those, 74%, were no longer receiving any treatment by that time. The overall survival for nivolumab alone was 44%, and 26% for ipilimumab. Larkin said there had been little change in their patients between three and five years and they were hopeful they would continue to do well. \u201cThe chance of being alive at five years is quite similar to three years and four years,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those patients getting to five years, many or most are off treatment and leading normal lives.\u201d At the Royal Marsden, Larkin said he had now treated about 100 patients with advanced melanoma or advanced kidney cancer with the combination, which has been approved for use in the NHS for both conditions. The drugs have only been available for 10 to 15 years so the long-term outlook cannot be certain until people have survived into old age. \u201cThe definition of a cure is to have a normal life expectancy and die of something else,\u201d he said. Some people cannot tolerate the side effects of immunotherapy drugs and have to stop them within weeks of starting. But the researchers found that did not matter; even taking immunotherapy for a limited period appeared to kick-start the immune system into recognising and fighting the tumours. The survival rates among those who stopped were as good as in those who continued. For advanced melanoma, the standard course of treatment is two years, but some people may need much less, Larkin said. Pamela Smith, 67, joined the immunotherapy trial in January 2014, soon after discovering her melanoma had spread. \u201cIt was inoperable, so the trial was my only option,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d been having treatment every two weeks for about four months when I developed diarrhoea that was so bad I had to come off treatment. Amazingly, the first scan and every scan since has shown that in that relatively short time it worked. My tumour shrank to less than half its original size and it hasn\u2019t changed in five years. \u201cI\u2019ve not had any treatment since and I feel brilliant. At every appointment at the Royal Marsden, they ask how I feel on a scale of one to 100 and I answer 100. I feel well and very lucky to be alive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There is a glut of gorgeous non-fiction for five to eight this month. Amid a profusion of inspirational life stories, Rise Up: Ordinary Kids with Extraordinary Stories (Buster) by Amanda Li, illustrated by Amy Blackwell, stands out for readability and range, featuring Syrian photographer Mohamad Al Jounde and champion Nepalese golfer Pratima Sherpa as well as activists Malala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg. Brief, punchy biographies are interspersed with how-to tips, from knot-tying to leadership skills, encouraging young readers to have a go themselves. For seven and up, Mythologica (Wide Eyed) is a glorious oversized compendium of Greek myths by Stephen Kershaw, a classics professor whose text strikes a satisfying balance between concision and nuance (Apollo\u2019s eyes, for instance, \u201cshone with divine brightness, but his smile was always mixed with anger\u201d). Victoria Topping\u2019s gold-leaf-and-collage illustrations evoke all the ferocity, beauty and fascination of Kershaw\u2019s gods, heroes and beasts. Katherine Woodfine fictionalises the childhood of pioneering aeronaut Sophie Blanchard (1778-1819) in Sophie Takes to the Sky (Barrington Stoke), with adorable illustrations by Briony May Smith. Sophie is frightened of everything \u2013 can she possibly pluck up courage to go and see the great balloon at the fair? A super-readable story, imbued with wonder. In picture books, The Misadventures of Frederick (Two Hoots) by Ben Manley and Emma Chichester Clark is a delight. Frederick lies, bored, in a gloomy mansion, until a paper aeroplane flies in, inviting him to join Emily for an ice-cream. Afraid of the consequences, Frederick sends his excuses (\u201cIt is with bitter regret that I inform you I may not come out to eat ice-creams today\u201d), until eventually vivid colours creep into his tenebrous rooms, and he yields to persuasion. The Edward Goreyesque tone of Frederick\u2019s correspondence and the vibrancy of Chichester Clark\u2019s images weave together in a tale of sly wit and sunlit joy. Bustling miniature life, meanwhile, saturates the pages of Chris Judge\u2019s Tiny and Teeny (Walker), featuring kindly Tiny and her pet fox Teeny, who live in a hollowed-out apple. Tiny is always helping people \u2013 but who will help her when her home is squashed by a meteorite? Mouthwatering colours add to a story with shades of Richard Scarry. Sandra Dieckmann\u2019s Waiting for Wolf (Hodder) is a tear-jerking tale of two friends, Fox and Wolf, and what happens when Wolf turns into starlight and disappears. Unable to accept the loss, Fox searches everywhere \u2013 until she realises that Wolf is never coming back, but that she has their shared memories still to treasure. From her illuminated heavens to Fox\u2019s slumped, despondent posture, Dieckmann fills her illustrations with deep emotion in this beautiful book. For eight-plus readers, Max Kowalski Didn\u2019t Mean It (Puffin) by Susie Day is immensely satisfying \u2013 a runaway adventure with strong, complex feelings. After his dad goes missing, it\u2019s up to Max to keep things going; if that means taking his sisters secretly to Wales, that\u2019s what he\u2019ll do. When he learns there\u2019s a golden dragon hidden on the mountainside, though, he believes all his troubles may be behind him. Full of the taxing tenderness of family love, Day\u2019s latest novel is an absolute corker. Classic mystery mixes with contemporary themes in Lori and Max (Firefly), the first children\u2019s novel from Costa-winning Catherine O\u2019Flynn. Budding detective Lori is dismayed to have to look after the weird new kid at school, but when Max is accused of a crime Lori knows she couldn\u2019t have committed, she dedicates her well-honed skills to finding Max and clearing her name in this pacy, gripping story.

When Yanka wakes up one day with bear\u2019s legs, she sets out to discover who she really is, forging friendships, exchanging stories and figuring out her place in the world.

When tragedy strikes their family, can the brothers learn to weather it together? This sensitive, heartbreaking story boasts a wonderful narrative voice and secret codes that add another layer of intrigue.

But if Joy and Frank pretend to be going out together, both will be free to see non-Korean partners. What could possibly go wrong? A hilarious, acutely observed and profoundly poignant novel about romance, identity and growing up.

The Tigers have done it. The Richmond Football Club wins its 12th flag, and the second in three years. A flag starts to become an era.</p> <p>How big an achievement is that. Richmond lost Alex Rance, their star full-back, at the start of the season to a knee injury. Cotchin was gone for much of the season. So was Riewoldt. So was their main ruckman Nankervis. And yet they backed up, and filled the gaps, and kept winning through the back half of the season. Made the finals. Then began to really show their quality and exert their pressure.</p> <p>Two fast-running clubs in Geelong and GWS were both completely shut down. There was no clear path to goal, in either the prelim or the grand final today. And in those tight contests, Richmond had the quality to get clear often enough with their chains of fast possession, and get away.<br></p> <p>And then there\u2019s the club mentality of Shaun Grigg, who decided that his injuries were unlikely to let him recover in time to play finals, and gave up his spot on the list so that Richmond could activate Pickett as a rookie. Here he is, having starred today, the first player to debut in a grand final in about 70 years.<br></p> <p>Tiger supporters \u2013 how does this feel? You can let us know in the comments below. There were many long years of deflation and disappointment, so this is your time.

Shaun Grigg and Brett Deledio share a car together: of course, both played together for years at the Tigers, before Lids moved to the Giants late in his career, just before that Richmond flag. Must be a bittersweet couple of years for him, with injury cruelling those last years and costing him the chance at an appearance today.

The culmination of the AFL season and all that has come before: all the score reviews, all the frothing about umpires, all the trade rumours \u2013 no, wait, they\u2019ll just keep going. But on the playing front, this is it. The Richmond Tigers, trying to make sure their year of success in 2017 isn\u2019t standalone, but can be pointed to as an era. And the Greater Western Sydney Giants, the standout success of the AFL\u2019s expansion era, who have won over some of the cynics with an exciting style of play, a good club attitude, and <em>that</em> song, which has been the only thing heard in Melbourne for the last week.

      "bodyText": "A wonderful, affirming day for Richmond supporters and for the club. And don\u2019t forget such an impressive season from the Giants, coming from 6th to make it here today. Hope you enjoyed it one way or another. Until next season. Cotchin speaks well. Damien Hardwick gets the Jock McHale medal. Very gracious speech from Hardwick towards the Giants, saying that they overcame adversity throughout the season much as the Tigers had, and saying how much his club respects theirs. Nice touch. Then the cup is handed over, the yellow and black confetti explodes, and the players all rush onto the stage. The song blares. Sixteen Tigers are now dual premiership players. Medals being handed out. Jack Riewoldt has his baby in the crook of one arm, while putting a cap on the head of the girl handing him his medal, then dipping his head for the presentation, then shaking her hand as they introduce themselves. Multitasking, and all very sweet. No huge surprises there. Pickett had a brilliant day, Riewoldt kicked five, but Martin was probably the key in the first and second quarters when the game was there to be won. He keeps his speech short and loud. \u201cThanks to the AFL and their partners, thanks to GWS, thanks to the fans, YELLOW AND BLACK!\u201d There is a big, big sound, but it\u2019s the roar of the Tiger and the trumpets of that famous song, coming from just to the east of the MCG. The Tigers have done it. The Richmond Football Club wins its 12th flag, and the second in three years. A flag starts to become an era. How big an achievement is that. Richmond lost Alex Rance, their star full-back, at the start of the season to a knee injury. Cotchin was gone for much of the season. So was Riewoldt. So was their main ruckman Nankervis. And yet they backed up, and filled the gaps, and kept winning through the back half of the season. Made the finals. Then began to really show their quality and exert their pressure. Two fast-running clubs in Geelong and GWS were both completely shut down. There was no clear path to goal, in either the prelim or the grand final today. And in those tight contests, Richmond had the quality to get clear often enough with their chains of fast possession, and get away. And then there\u2019s the club mentality of Shaun Grigg, who decided that his injuries were unlikely to let him recover in time to play finals, and gave up his spot on the list so that Richmond could activate Pickett as a rookie. Here he is, having starred today, the first player to debut in a grand final in about 70 years. Tiger supporters \u2013 how does this feel? You can let us know in the comments below. There were many long years of deflation and disappointment, so this is your time. Enjoy it. Q4: 0 mins remaining: Rich 17.12 (114) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 Wait, is it goal time for favourite sons? Don\u2019t forget Jack Riewoldt. Set shot, straight in front, 20 seconds remaining, and he drifts it just inside the left post! Q4: 1 mins remaining: Rich 16.12 (108) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 If that wasn\u2019t enough icing for Tiger fans, Williams can\u2019t mark at half-forward for GWS under pressure from Grimes and Vlaustin. The ball comes the other way, spoiled, comes to ground, Dustin Martin picks up, and Richmond\u2019s other star (one of many, really) snaps a goal from near the fifty! Q4: 2 mins remaining: Rich 15.12 (102) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 Ticking down into the final minutes, a lot of back and forth, stop and tackle, and then finally one shaft of daylight shoots through. Rioli from the half-back flank splits the field open with a cross-field kick. Finds Cotchin at the back of the centre square. The Richmond skipper runs through the centre, to fifty, and laces a goal! Gets a shepherd on the line from Lynch and through it goes. Raises the ton. Celebration time! Q4: 5 mins remaining: Rich 14.12 (96) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 A lot of tired bodies and scrappy play. Heavy legs. Greene trying to contest in the forward pocket as a Giant counterattack swings forward. Held out of the way but Toby Greene won\u2019t get much love from any umpires. Down the other end, Prestia has a shot but misses. Q4: 7 mins remaining: Rich 14.11 (95) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 Richmond players enjoying themselves on the bench now, all smiles. Those rare moments of knowing that the result of a grand final will go your way. Q4: 11 mins remaining: Rich 14.11 (95) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 Pickett with another score involvement! This time a goal. It\u2019s Pickett\u2019s kick around the body from the 50 to the top of the square. Rioli flies to mark, Riewoldt grabs the crumb and kicks his fourth. Q4: 13 mins remaining: Rich 13.11 (89) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 The Giants up that Members wing again via Greene and Cameron, but this time the long delivery only finds a Tiger mark. Richmond link up through Houli, Rioli, Martin up the Southern Stand side. Centre the ball. Mumford spoils at centre half, but Pickett is there for the crumbs. Inside 50, feed Castagna, who misses for the sixth time today. Five points and one out on the full. Another score involvement for Pickett. Could he win the Norm Smith? Is that a real sentence I\u2019m typing? GWS lose the ball again in the centre, and the kick comes back for Bolton to mark and goal! Share them around now. Q4: 16 mins remaining: Rich 12.9 (81) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 Nearly another goal for GWS, but over-possession in the forward pocket sees the ball spoiled out. Williams guilty of that a few times today. A lengthy chain of handballs rather than a shot at goal. Richmond rebound. Q4: 18 mins remaining: Rich 12.9 (81) to GWS 3.7 (25) \u2013 The Tigers win it straight out of the centre, but Rioli is pinged for diving on the ball at full-forward. Never mind, because GWS can\u2019t get past the halfway line again. A relieving mark as the ball comes back inside 50, then emerges once more through Haynes. Finally GWS get up the wing to Greene. He finds Cameron across the arc at centre half, who drives deep into the pocket. Himmelberg marks, plays on, and snaps around the body for the Giants\u2019 third! Richmond have got this in the bag. One quarter to go. It\u2019s Tiger Time. Q3: 0 mins remaining: Rich 12.9 (81) to GWS 2.7 (19) \u2013 A few clumsy tackles from the Giants up forward cost them a chance at possession. Jeremy Cameron jumps into Baker while trying to spoil and hits him high. Then Greene collects Houli on the ground. Richmond get down the far end, and now it\u2019s the big moustachioed ruckman Ivan Soldo in space who marks in the pocket and kicks one more on the siren! Q3: 2 mins remaining: Rich 11.9 (75) to GWS 2.7 (19) \u2013 Dustin Martin does about three circles in the tackle at half forward and is pinged for holding the ball. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Razor!\u201d he screams at the umpire. 50 metre penalty for abuse. GWS end up at half-forward. It\u2019s not clean, it\u2019s not smooth, but it\u2019s a Giant goal! The ball comes into a pack, bounces free, and Hopper is there after his big whack earlier to finally kick the Giant\u2019s second. Q3: 3 mins remaining: Rich 11.9 (75) to GWS 1.7 (13) \u2013 High contact on Richmond, advantage paid at the top of the centre square. Castagna tries passing off this time, to Rioli, but he misses from just inside 50 as well. Q3: 6 mins remaining: Rich 11.8 (74) to GWS 1.7 (13) \u2013 Richmond just attacking as they please now, and still the Giants can\u2019t get a clean possession. Davis saves another goal right on the line, marking a curling snap. Williams has pace on the wing but turns the ball over. For Richmond, Castagna has another flying shot and misses, he\u2019s missed a lot of shots today. Then it\u2019s the big ruckman Nankervis getting on the scoreboard, for a point, as he gathers a loose ball in the pocket and snaps back across his body. Q3: 9 mins remaining: Rich 11.6 (72) to GWS 1.7 (13) \u2013 Now the rout is on. GWS get a free in the middle, and have it overturned again when Himmelberg supposedly lays an illegal block in the goalsquare. Not sure about that free kick either, the Richmond player ran across Himmelberg\u2019s line at the ball. Richmond flow forward instead, and Kane Lambert on the run nails another. Q3: 12 mins remaining: Rich 10.6 (66) to GWS 1.6 (12) \u2013 A tale of contrasting days. GWS finally get a good sequence of passes down one wing, but there\u2019s nowhere to go once they reach the forward line. Richmond cut it off, and eventually win a free for Castagna being held. Then Richmond produce a Harlem Globetrotters run down the Members wing, with flick-passes, volleyball taps, players waiting for the bouncing ball correctly before zipping the pass on, and finally Pickett gets possession and slams it long inside 50 for Martin to mark on the lead. Martin goes back to take his shot, then fakes and squares across goal! Pickett has drifted forward! He marks, and on debut in a grand final, nails his set shot! Q3: 13 mins remaining: Rich 9.6 (60) to GWS 1.6 (12) \u2013 GWS needed to explode out of the blocks in the second half, and instead they\u2019ve had none of the footy and generated zero run. Cameron ventures all the way up onto the wing to find a touch, having barely seen the ball since that first goal. But his square-up kick is no good, turning the ball over, and it goes forward for Richmond into the pocket. The Giants think it\u2019s out of bounds, but Rioli produces an underground handball, on the bounce to Martin, who snaps from deep in the pocket as per his specialty! What a finish. Q3: 15 mins remaining: Rich 8.6 (54) to GWS 1.6 (12) \u2013 It could all have been over for the Giants when Castagna had a shot from the pocket early, but he sprays it out on the full. It could be over when Lynch has a set shot from in front, but he shanks it. It could be over when Martin tries a checkside on the run, but he bellies it. And it could be over when Riewoldt marks in the pocket, but he fades left. It\u2019s only after five minutes of countdown time, when Lynch marks 30 out in front, that it\u2019s over. Straight through the middle. The Giants just cannot get through the middle of the ground. Now the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: the Grand Final Sprint. It\u2019s fast, and over quickly. Ben King of the Gold Coast beats Frost of Melbourne, and that\u2019s an unexpected involvement in a grand-final day victory for the Suns. That\u2019s the half, and you\u2019d think Richmond have just about won the flag with that second quarter. Five goals in the quarter, unanswered. Lots of pressure, lots of turnovers, fast movement forward. \u201cI just think you can see Richmond blokes flying in,\u201d says Riewoldt on the telly. And follows up with this lovely line. \u201cI just think footy\u2019s a mysterious game.\u201d So it is. And the one thing the Giants can tell themselves is that they haven\u2019t been blown away. They haven\u2019t looked like some of the shellshocked sides who have played this corresponding fixture in years past. They just haven\u2019t been able to get any run into their game. But they have been fighting hard, and they could be ten goals down rather than five. Q2: 1 mins remaining: Rich 7.5 (47) to GWS 1.6 (12) \u2013 A lot of action. Giants win a free for holding the ball after the bounce, but Greene turns it over with a downfield free. Tigers don\u2019t make use, but Hopper is injured when he gets a hard shepherd in the ribs. Greene tries to make amends by pulling a Dustin Martin fend on Dustin Martin. Giants go forward via Taranto, but his kick is too heavy to find Jeremy Cameron. And finally, as the Tigers come back downfield, Riewoldt steams out to mark just inside 50, go back, and kick left to right for another! The Tigers\u2019 main man is going to be the difference today. Q2: 4 mins remaining: Rich 6.5 (41) to GWS 1.6 (12) \u2013 The Giants avert what looks a certain goal as the Tigers get another counterattack sailing into an almost empty forward line. But Marlion Pickett has a rare fumble. The Giants clear, but eventually it\u2019s turned over on the wing, comes back inside 50, and Riewoldt on the lead takes a strong mark 40 out! No concerns with the set shot for him. Q2: 6 mins remaining: Rich 5.5 (35) to GWS 1.6 (12) \u2013 Daniels blows another chance for GWS, with a set shot missing from 45 out. Won the free for a blow to the head in the marking contest. Q2: 7 mins remaining: Rich 5.5 (35) to GWS 1.5 (11) \u2013 A couple of forays forward for GWS, but Richmond\u2019s defence holds firm. Once, twice. They mop up, spread the ball, have runners. The Giants have chances, but can\u2019t get that last clean possession to find a mark or a player in the clear. De Boer finally has a shot on the run, but misses across the face. Q2: 9 mins remaining: Rich 5.5 (35) to GWS 1.4 (10) \u2013 GWS take a little bit of pace out of the game thanks to some hard tackling on the wing. A range of stoppages. Martin comes up on the wing, dragging Heath Shaw up there with him and trying to expose him for pace. After a few minutes though the Tigers do break free, race forward, but the shot at pace is out on the full. Giants clear through Shaw, then switch play, boost forward looking for Himmelberg, but he was outnumbered by about four to one. Soldo marks. Q2: 12 mins remaining: Rich 5.5 (35) to GWS 1.4 (10) \u2013 The Giants finally string a few handballs together down the wing. Himmelberg a free kick at half forward, Greene a snap from the pocket but he\u2019s tackled as he kicks. Behind. Q2: 13 mins remaining: Rich 5.5 (35) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 Five in a row for the Tigers! Pickett scrubs a handball out of the centre, Rioli kicks from the flank, and Lynch cuts across into the right pocket to take the mark. Tough kick from there but he slots his drop punt. The Giants are teetering. Q2: 15 mins remaining: Rich 4.5 (29) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 The floodgates are creaking, and might just be about to burst. Martin again, as the ball came in over his head on the lead. He stops leading, nudges his opponent out, doubles back and gets the ball off the turf, runs laterally past two more defenders, then dribbles home the snap from 30! Q2: 16 mins remaining: Rich 3.5 (23) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 Nearly another from the centre bounce, as Picket (!!!) grabs the ball, spins out of a tackle, and kicks lace out to the top of the square! What a move! Castagna gets up high, grabs half the ball, then collects the rebound at ground level. Great leaping mark. But hits the post with this shot. Q2: 17 mins remaining: Rich 3.4 (22) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 Riewoldt kicks Richmond\u2019s third, and they might break the game open a quarter late, but break it anyway. That was a dodgy call from the umpire I think: Davis contested the ball, nudged Jack in the side rather than the back, and Riewoldt rather threw himself out of the contest. Gets the free and snaps it, though. Q2: 18 mins remaining: Rich 2.4 (16) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 Richmond coast to coast from the kick-in: Lambert to Castagna, who sprints down the wing, a couple of bounces, has a shot from the pocket and misses to the right. Q2: 19 mins remaining: Rich 2.3 (15) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 An early foray for the Giants from the bounce, getting the ball to half-forward, then a scrappy kick after a pick-up from the turf, and Himmelburg is in the right spot in the right pocket. He starts his shot left but it stays that way. A genuine arm wrestle of a quarter, where early on it looked like the Tigers might blast five or six clear, but the Giants kept hanging on. Wouldn\u2019t let them score, then finally kicked the first goal of the match themselves after 20 minutes of play. Finally the Tigers got some reward with a couple of GWS mistakes late, and some glimpses of fast clean play. Catch your breath. Q1: 0 mins remaining: Rich 2.3 (15) to GWS 1.2 (8) \u2013 Right on the siren, Daniel Rioli gets the Tigers another! GWS had forced a throw-in at half-back with 17 seconds left. 15 seconds by the time the ruckmen contested it. Soldo took possession, then was tackled by Mumford and lost it. Davis had a chance to mop up at centre half back but the bouncing kick eluded him. Riolo picks up the ricochet with five seconds left, snaps with four, and the clock ticks down three, two, as the ball sails through. Siren! Tigers take the lead, then kick a goal clear! Q1: 1 mins remaining: Rich 1.3 (9) to GWS 1.2 (8) \u2013 Goal to Dustin Martin! The Tigers needed a lift and their talisman provides! Finally, with just a minute to go, they get some fast movement through the middle. Lambert\u2019s tackle creates a turnover, there\u2019s space through the middle for the Tigers, and Martin has a paddock to run back and mark, then run around the mark and snap truly. Q1: 2 mins remaining: Rich 0.3 (3) to GWS 1.2 (8) \u2013 More great play from the Giants. Daniels is sold into trouble in the centre square, looks like he\u2019s being smashed in a tackle, but stands up in it, bounces off the tackler, and escapes! Then drops a banana, on the run, to Mumford at centre half forward who spills the diving mark coming forward. Knocks the ball clear to try to keep it moving forward, but it gets locked in. Q1: 3 mins remaining: Rich 0.3 (3) to GWS 1.2 (8) \u2013 Goal to Jeremy Cameron! He\u2019s a more popular candidate to open the account, and what a kick it was! What a mark as well. Contested mark, steaming out of 50, marked right on the paint while wrestling hard. In the breadbasket in the end. Then he goes back on the left forward flank, kicks left-footed, 55 metres, the ball starting right but swinging back, back, and inside the post! Giants with the first. Q1: 5 mins remaining: Rich 0.3 (3) to GWS 0.2 (2) \u2013 Sam Reid nearly donates a goal to Richmond, turning the ball over in the centre square trying to come inboard, but Davis on the last line of defence intercepts the snap from the pocket. Doesn\u2019t even concede a point, holds the ball back over the goal line and then runs back out to clear the 50. The Giants fighting hard. Q1: 7 mins remaining: Rich 0.3 (3) to GWS 0.2 (2) \u2013 Himmelberg does well two on one on the forward flank, forces a throw-in. Soldo taps but the Tigers turn it over, a long kick inside 50 that goes out of bounds next to the behind post. Tough contests inside 50, and Pickett gets a free kick for high contact. Tigers lose it again in the centre square though, and back it comes... to Greene! The least popular player in the sport, would you say? Richmond fans boo immediately. How provocative if he kicked the first goal in a grand final! But his set shot misses to the right, from the left pocket. Q1: 10 mins remaining: Rich 0.3 (3) to GWS 0.1 (1) \u2013 Williams marks inside 50 and can have a shot for GWS, but he goes short and turns the ball over. Still no goals. GWS get on the board through Daniel Lloyd\u2019s miss as the Tigers let it roll through so they can clear defence with a kick-in. Q1: 12 mins remaining: Rich 0.3 (3) to GWS 0.0 (0) \u2013 Lots of punching out there, of the ball rather than each other. Both teams playing volleyball as the Giants try to clear. Riewoldt punches a loose ball back over his head towards the goalsquare, but it comes back out. Whitfield so calm in taking the ball out of the air, waiting, then playing on to clear the fifty with a long kick on the non-preferred. Short thumps long (Short is a player) to send it back in. Spoiled. Rushed. Eventually there\u2019s a flying shot and a third point dribbles through. Q1: 13 mins remaining: Rich 0.1 (1) to GWS 0.0 (0) \u2013 Yet another holding the ball paid against the Giants, on the wing this time. Richmond\u2019s tackling pressure has been outstanding. Their trademark. The Giants have barely had a clean possession. Bachar Houli with the tackle that time. The Giants repel this thrust, then get nailed for holding the ball again at half-forward for them. Tigers surge forward but have to go very wide looking for Martin and it\u2019s out of bounds. Q1: 15 mins remaining: Rich 0.1 (1) to GWS 0.0 (0) \u2013 Martin down on the ground and sore. He was trying to barge through the pack after a bounce at the top of the goal square, but got nailed. GWS try to get out of defence but the handball is errant, and Mumford has to grab the loose ball and wear a heavy tackle! This is fierce early stuff. Q1: 17 mins remaining: Rich 0.1 (1) to GWS 0.0 (0) \u2013 Back into Richmond\u2019s forward line again, and Lynch is warned for an accidental elbow on David while going up for the mark. Back inside the pocket, Dustin Martin scrapping by the boundary line, but it\u2019s over. Q1: 18 mins remaining: Rich 0.1 (1) to GWS 0.0 (0) \u2013 Great first bounce from the umpire, that was a skyscraper. GWS get the first surge forward but it\u2019s chopped off inside 50. The Tigers rebound, back into their forward pocket, where Riewoldt marks but it\u2019s not paid! Surely he had enough of that, lost it as he came down. Long kick back inside 50 looking for Lynch, but it\u2019s punched through for a behind. There goes the traditional rendition of the anthem in vibrato-laden fauxmotive pop style, trying to inject some life into the tune. And we\u2019re off. Dylan Alcott the tennis champ is at the centre circle to toss the coin. Davis and Trent Cotchin shake hands. Cotch wins the toss and will kick to the city end. Game time. Anthem time, and Stevie J brings the Premiership Cup out onto the field. Steve Johnson was a very popular late recruit to the Giants after a fine premiership career with Geelong. He hands the cup over to Maureen Hafey, the wife of late Richmond coach Tommy, and Kevin Sheedy, a great Richmond player who became the Giants\u2019 establishment coach. Here we go. The teams out onto the field. The Big Big Sound gets played for real! Then the roar as the Tigers come out, and their own pretty decent club song gets its first spin for the day. Mike Brady has been thawed out of carbonite as per annual tradition to sing Up There Cazaly before he goes back in the chamber. By rationing him out this way we\u2019ll have Mike Brady until the year 2337. Actually I wrote a piece about this song a few years ago. I can\u2019t remember if it was worth reading, but you can tell me. Here\u2019s how the Giants have established themselves \u2013 an in-depth piece from our footy writer Scott Heinrich. Phil Davis has passed his late late fitness test, by the way, for the Giants. And Marlion Pickett will debut for Richmond, incredibly, after starring in their VFL premiership win last week. Lots of eyes on those two players. The AFL banishes the ghosts of terrible pre-match entertainment past by bringing out Paul Kelly, who is sporting a neat beard and his old worn leather guitar strap. He opens of course with Leaps and Bounds, with its iconic opening line. \u201cHigh on the hill, looking over the bridge to the MCG...\u201d The refrain goes on, \u201cI remember,\u201d with the Bull Sisters backing up. That\u2019s what sport is all about most of the time, remembering the past and making us feel like the present has more significance. Paul finishes the song off with that exact them. \u201cI remember, number 23, Andrew McLeod, in 1997 and 98.\u201d Then launches into Dumb Things, endlessly one of the great rock n roll tunes. And of course the ultimate, for irony points... If you\u2019ve been under an internet rock in the last week, you won\u2019t be aware of the Big Big Sound. In short, the GWS theme song written by the Cat Empire\u2019s Harry Angus has suddenly caught the public imagination. No one heard it very often in the club\u2019s first few years, given that club songs get played after wins. But they\u2019ve heard it a lot in the last couple of years. And now, the people love it. (Most of the people. I\u2019m sure those opposed will be vocal. Shhhhh though. Let people enjoy things.) Let\u2019s have some highlights. A couple of nice moments with the retiring players being driven around for a farewell lap. Shaun Grigg and Brett Deledio share a car together: of course, both played together for years at the Tigers, before Lids moved to the Giants late in his career, just before that Richmond flag. Must be a bittersweet couple of years for him, with injury cruelling those last years and costing him the chance at an appearance today. But he\u2019s welcomed back warmly by the Tiger faithful, who are overwhelmingly outnumbering the others at the MCG. Nice touch. Also Pat Cummins and Meg Lanning are in a ute together: neither of them is retiring, thankfully, but they\u2019re carrying the Ashes trophies that they each brought back from touring England this winter. Where is it coming from? The town. The west thereof, to be specific. What is the sound of? Apparently some giants, who are distinguishable from other giants by way of being mighty. And by way of using only Caps Lock in their own communications. It is, in short, Grand Final time. The culmination of the AFL season and all that has come before: all the score reviews, all the frothing about umpires, all the trade rumours \u2013 no, wait, they\u2019ll just keep going. But on the playing front, this is it. The Richmond Tigers, trying to make sure their year of success in 2017 isn\u2019t standalone, but can be pointed to as an era. And the Greater Western Sydney Giants, the standout success of the AFL\u2019s expansion era, who have won over some of the cynics with an exciting style of play, a good club attitude, and that song, which has been the only thing heard in Melbourne for the last week. Not sure how widely it\u2019s playing in the west of Sydney, but it\u2019s big in Fitzroy. What a day. What a combo. With the slightest shift of the colour filter, yellow and black becomes orange and charcoal. What better set of teams to play off, old and new, heritage and newly written history. A pleasure to have your company for the biggest of big dances \u2013 and no, I don\u2019t mind calling it that. Leave your thoughts below the line, and let\u2019s keep it clean.",

There is an argument that many of us would secretly be happier if we could wave at each other on FaceTime and then crack on with our own personal idea of heaven. I heard Gyles Brandreth say on a recent podcast that he is strictly anti-festive fuss. He marks the big day by going nowhere and eating a microwaved vegetarian dinner. Look at him, for God\u2019s sake: the happiest man in Britain. While we all bicker and double-book and seethe, one man alone is experiencing the most wonderful time of the year.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fka-twigs\" title=\"\">FKA </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fka-twigs\" title=\"\">twigs</a> lives in a real house, in the real world, though this seems hard to believe. She appears so alien, in her music and her performances, in the way she presents herself, that you\u2019d be forgiven for believing that she lived in a cryo chamber alongside bejewelled hip-hop robots, or a martial arts monastery surrounded by an enchanted thicket of thorns.</p> <p>Twigs\u2019 art is not of the stripped-back, real me, acoustics-and-grubby-jeans variety. She arrived on the scene in 2012, whispering like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tricky\" title=\"\">Tricky</a>, clattering like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">the xx</a>, romancing like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\" title=\"\">Prince</a>, singing like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush\" title=\"\">Kate Bush</a>, yet not actually quite like anyone else. A polymath \u2013 she is a beautiful dancer and has directed pop videos and immersive theatre \u2013 she works in experimental hinterlands, creating atmospheres rather than singalong stories. For example: the sparse and sad track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\" title=\"\">Cellophane</a>, released in April as the opening single for her new album, was accompanied by a video that featured twigs athletically pole-dancing in a sparkly bikini before being eaten by a lookalike insect, falling into watery depths and being covered in orange mud by caring tortoise creatures. Twigs is about intensity, beauty, sexuality and freakiness.</p> <p>Because of this, I\u2019ve geared myself up for her to be a tricky interviewee. Distant. Abstract. Maybe a bit defiant. But twigs is not like this. She is friendly and quite serious. She has a light, RP voice with a slight lisp and a young face; though she is now 31, she can seem 10 years younger, especially when she laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99ec36ee28ab3e6f8ab154766518b771a7d49f34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99ec36ee28ab3e6f8ab154766518b771a7d49f34/0_292_2552_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FKA Twigs performs at the Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm, Pilton on June 28, 2015 in Glastonbury, England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"931\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Glastonbury in 2015. Photograph: WireImage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Martindale/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We meet in her lovely home in east London. Her sitting room is olive green, with plants and a piano, fossils and tapestries and books about jazz. Preserved snakes twist under glass domes. There is a Diptyque Feu du Bois candle burning. The vibe is part museum of curiosities, part comfy boutique hotel. Her small dog, Solo, is lounging on the rug. \u201cI found her in LA four years ago, behind a nail salon,\u201d twigs says. \u201cShe was tiny, about six months old, and all alone.\u201d (For the dog spotters: Solo enjoys chasing a ball and can do sit, paw and lie down. And, yes, she sleeps on twigs\u2019 bed.)</p> <p>Twigs thinks about how she presents herself. For this interview, she has dressed in an embroidered white shirt, Burberry shorts and white socks, with velvet ribbons at her throat. Her hair is partly dyed a wild red. Like the dancer she is, she\u2019s poised but casual, plonking herself on the floor (all dancers sit on the floor). Sweetly, she has three types of posh juice for me to choose from, though she herself drinks herbal tea.</p> <p>It\u2019s taken her some time to sort her house out; for quite a while, she just had a sofa, a bed and a TV: \u201cVery discombobulating,\u201d she says. Before that, she\u2019d been living in a rented house share, and didn\u2019t have the money to furnish her new pad, though now she does (Nike appointed her creative director for a 2017 womenswear campaign, and she\u2019s made an advert with Apple, so her money situation has improved). Anyway, even if she\u2019d had the cash, she wouldn\u2019t have been up for decorating; she has had a difficult couple of years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It felt like I\u2019d made this ornate golden birdcage. And I stepped in and was like, oh gosh, this is actually a nightmare</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though she didn\u2019t make it public \u2013 and refuses to talk about it with me \u2013 in 2017 she split up with her long-term boyfriend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-pattinson\" title=\"\">Robert Pattinson</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/02/ten-years-of-twilight-the-extraordinary-feminist-legacy-of-the-panned-vampire-saga\" title=\"\">Twilight Saga</a> actor who\u2019s set to be the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/batman\" title=\"\">Batman</a>. Their relationship had brought her tabloid scrutiny and weird fan abuse: Pattinson fans can be rabid, and racially trolled twigs on social media. After their split, she no longer had a home base in LA \u2013 plus she was ill (more about this later) and, most importantly for her, she was in an artistic fug.</p> <p>She found the new album \u2013 Magdalene, her second \u2013 really hard to make, she says, mostly because she wanted to change but couldn\u2019t figure out how. She began work on it as soon as she had finished her first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/07/fka-twigs-lp1-review\" title=\"\">LP1</a>, but couldn\u2019t find the right sound, and couldn\u2019t write songs in the way she wanted. Producers assumed she wanted to work with the fractured, futuristic noise of LP1 again and she felt trapped. Though she managed one song \u2013 Day Bed, which ends the album, and is about being depressed \u2013 she was stuck, workwise, in an artistry of her own making.</p> <p>\u201cI find it easy to write over complete musical randomness,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I wanted. I wanted something simpler, something honest. It felt like I\u2019d made this ornate golden birdcage, and everything was so intricate \u2013 like tapestries and beading and beautiful wirework. And I stepped in and I locked the door and I was like, oh my gosh, this is actually a nightmare.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"690c1b565919cb2f861d1a1f08328dd348b1ed0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/690c1b565919cb2f861d1a1f08328dd348b1ed0f/118_87_1658_2401/691.jpg\" alt=\"FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson attend \u201cManus x Machina: Fashion In An Age Of Technology\u201d Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2, 2016 in New York City\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Robert Pattinson in 2016\u2026 Photograph: WireImage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"715384e8ad2e59f5fb574c313a40af47247840a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/715384e8ad2e59f5fb574c313a40af47247840a0/254_197_1520_2856/532.jpg\" alt=\"FKA twigs with Shia LaBoeuf in 2018\" width=\"532\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026and Shia LaBeouf in 2018.

Her music altered, her relationship ended, her health went haywire. A disciplined workaholic, twigs sees life as a matter of spinning plates \u2013 \u201cYou have family and friends, and you have adult things, like where you live and bills and stuff like that, then your health, maybe your relationship\u201d \u2013 and, for a while, around 2017, nearly all the plates dropped to the floor and smashed. \u201cEverything was in complete turmoil,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only thing that didn\u2019t get smashed or shaken was one or two great friends.\u201d</p> <p>Things came to a head in LA, in just one week. She\u2019d been searching for the right musical collaborator, and had found one in cult electronica artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/29/nicolas-jaar-the-only-thing-i-was-excited-about-was-can-electronic-music-be-political\" title=\"\">Nicolas Jaar</a>. They wrote Cellophane together in about 20 minutes, and she was thrilled. But she also felt physically terrible. She had a lump in her stomach that she\u2019d been ignoring for months and one day that week, she woke and found she couldn\u2019t sit up. She phoned her stepfather. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, I fucked up. I have some terrible thing in my stomach and it\u2019s really big and I must have stomach cancer and I\u2019ve not told anyone and I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any coming back.\u2019\u201d Twigs says this all in rapid-fire full tragedy mode, rolling her eyes at herself. What did your stepfather say? \u201cHe said, \u2018Go to the doctor.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>An ultrasound scan revealed not cancer, but fibroids \u2013 hormonal growths on her uterus. Twigs\u2019s were enormous \u2013 \u201cTwo cooking apples, three kiwis and a couple of strawberries: a fruit bowl of pain,\u201d as she described them <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fkatwigs/?hl=en\" title=\"\">on Instagram</a> \u2013 and she had laparoscopic surgery, back in the UK. \u201cThey went in through three or four entry points\u201d \u2013 she points at her stomach \u2013 \u201cand pulled out the fibroids, like a string of sausages, through my bellybutton.\u201d</p> <p>She had been in pain for a while; plus the fibroids had been pressing down on her bowel and bladder, making her want to pee all the time and giving her unpleasant IBS symptoms. She remembers working on a video before the operation. \u201cI had to do voguing in it and the choreographers, these two women, weren\u2019t very nice and said, \u2018You\u2019re really lazy and you keep going to the toilet all the time.\u2019 My whole life, I\u2019d never been called lazy. It made me break down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"686682f16b98673eef75e01afcbc50ec29d77a43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/686682f16b98673eef75e01afcbc50ec29d77a43/0_804_6792_6409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musician FKA twigs, photographed in London Sept 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"944\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clothes and jewellery: <a href=\"https://www.chanel.com/en_GB/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7-LMjLrp5AIVDEPTCh2VlA3AEAAYASAAEgLxO_D_BwE\">Chanel</a>.

He wanted her to audition for <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=10156490557179255&amp;_rdr\" title=\"\">an ad</a><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=10156490557179255&amp;_rdr\" title=\"\"> he was making for Apple\u2019s Home</a><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=10156490557179255&amp;_rdr\" title=\"\">Pod</a>. For the audition, she had to dance around this very room in front of her laptop, hoping her stitches wouldn\u2019t split. \u201cThen they said, \u2018That\u2019s great. Now can you do it again and, like, touch the objects in the room?\u2019\u201d She laughs. But being a pro \u2013 she had spent years as a dancer for hire \u2013 she did as they asked. \u201cI was like, \u2018Sure, from the beginning of the song or halfway through? No problem. You want it again, but in a crop top?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s joking, but both incidents indicate the same thing about her. Twigs is a worker. She moved to London from Cheltenham when she was 17 and spent a few years as a back-up dancer, hired to shimmy behind stars such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\" title=\"\">Ed Sheeran</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue\" title=\"\">Kylie Minogue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jessie-j\" title=\"\">Jessie J</a>. Even now that she\u2019s an artist in her own right, she flips between being in charge, as a musician and director, and being directed, when she\u2019s dancing. She\u2019s more inclined to the former, though doesn\u2019t mind being told what to do if she\u2019s learning and she thinks the work is good. She likes collaboration, and \u201cI have a good taste barometer\u201d.</p> <p>Anyhow, she wants to talk more about fibroids, because she had never heard of them until she got them, even though many women suffer with them, especially women of Caribbean origin (twigs is half Jamaican). She\u2019s learned that they can be managed through stress management and diet: it\u2019s important to avoid sugar and foods with oestrogen, she says \u2013 soy, dairy, non-organic meat. Also, receipts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48a546e81f1913f2f71d475df0ba416ab6ddc490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48a546e81f1913f2f71d475df0ba416ab6ddc490/0_260_3952_2524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FKA twigs performs in concert at Park Avenue Armory on May 12, 2019 in New York City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In concert in New York in May this year.

I say, wondering if I\u2019ve heard her wrong.</p> <p>\u201cYes. The paper they use, the ink, there\u2019s something about it that\u2019s got a lot of oestrogen and you ingest it through your skin.\u201d</p> <p>Hmm, I say, but when I check later, I discover twigs is right: <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/cancer/do-shop-receipts-contain-cancer-causing-chemicals/\" title=\"\">receipt ink </a><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/cancer/do-shop-receipts-contain-cancer-causing-chemicals/\" title=\"\">contains BPA</a>, an artificial oestrogen, which can be absorbed through contact. God, what a tricky thing. She also avoids tap water, because it has traces of the pill in it, and can\u2019t use hormonal contraception: \u201cI\u2019m a believer in western medicine, but there are other ways, depending on how your body works.\u201d She has been really careful, but still her fibroids grew back within three months. Now she has six more, which she is managing. \u201cAs soon as I had my operation, I felt so much better,\u201d she says, \u201clike all these trapped-up feelings were released. But I\u2019ve never felt the same since. I\u2019m different.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ccbd8cf003275d089ec638fc523eb117670ee3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ccbd8cf003275d089ec638fc523eb117670ee3f/1497_659_2154_5654/381.jpg\" alt=\"Musician FKA twigs, photographed in London Sept 2019\" width=\"381\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacket and blouse: <a href=\"https://www.celine.com/en-gb/celine-shop-women/\">Celine by Hedi Slimane</a>.

She knew that she wanted to pole dance for the video for Cellophane and it took her six months of training to get strong enough to do it. She is a true athlete now: she has learned how to do an aerial cartwheel, she is proficient in a type of sword kung fu called <a href=\"http://www.iwuf.org/sport-wushu/\" title=\"\">wushu</a>, which she\u2019s been using in her live shows. She chose to learn this, she tells me, because it\u2019s the opposite of pole dancing, very grounded and \u201cweighted in the pelvis\u201d, requiring her to use her legs. She is stronger than she\u2019s ever been.</p> <p>I do wonder about the pole dancing. She\u2019s done it before, in the video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM5XogpX1JA\" title=\"\">Fukk Sleep</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/asap-rocky\" title=\"\">A$AP Rocky</a> song she guested on, where it was more straightforwardly man-pleasing. But twigs has always explored her sexuality in her work and tells me, \u201cMy sexuality tank and my creativity tank are the same tank, which is great, but also quite frustrating.\u201d If she\u2019s feeling sexually confused or uninspired, then her work is off; but equally, if her work is good, then she feels strong and sexual. In the Cellophane video, she is unbelievably sexy, but her needy lyrics \u2013 \u201cDidn\u2019t I do it for you? Why don\u2019t I do it for you?\u201d \u2013 play against this.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cI think that, in society, as a woman, you can be this beautiful creature and you want to be that for yourself, but there\u2019s also a part of you that is doing it for the approval of the opposite sex. And that can lead you to feeling, \u2018Am I good enough? Have I done enough?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If it seems a bit extreme \u2013 twirling around a pole in the full splits position just to get a man to think you\u2019re great \u2013 well, twigs has started asking questions about such things. She watched the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/13/kathy-burkes-all-woman-review-beauty-nations-bluntest-nana\" title=\"\">Kathy Burke TV series All Woman</a>, which she loved, and she\u2019s been noticing how women often do the \u201cemotional labour\u201d of a relationship, what she calls \u201clearned behaviour\u201d. To her chagrin, she is often referred to in terms of her boyfriends (since Pattinson, she\u2019s been linked with another actor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shia-labeouf\" title=\"\">Shia L</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shia-labeouf\" title=\"\">aBeo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shia-labeouf\" title=\"\">uf</a>, and is dating <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reubenesser/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Reuben Esser</a>, fashion editor of <a href=\"https://www.anothermanmag.com/\" title=\"\">Another Man</a> magazine). It irritates her, but she is also conflicted about relationships in general.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been indoctrinated to feel like when I\u2019m with a man, things are better,\u201d she says, \u201cregardless of whether they are or not. I\u2019ve been made to feel like, if I\u2019m with a man, then I\u2019m doing the right thing, I\u2019m validated, I have a tick to my name. And even though I don\u2019t really believe that, because I\u2019m intelligent and I understand things, it\u2019s somewhere inside me.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Twigs grew up in Cheltenham as Tahliah Debrett Barnett, the only child of an English-Spanish single mother from Birmingham, who\u2019d moved out to the countryside to give her daughter a better life. And it was, twigs says; she loved being outside, she enjoyed nature. The walls and ceilings of her room were painted dark blue, with stars and moons on them.</p> <p>As a child, she had a great imagination \u2013 \u201cIt was on fleek!\u201d she says \u2013 and often mixed up daydreams and reality: until she was about 12, she sort of believed she could fly and hang in the air, simply by jumping off the stairs. Clever and hard-working, she got a scholarship to a private all-girls Catholic secondary school, which she enjoyed while feeling entirely different from everyone else. There were no other mixed-race students. Her stepfather, who moved in when she was little, was one of the few black people in her life. When he gave lifts to her friends, she was embarrassed by the music he played in the car: acid jazz, real jazz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fela-kuti\" title=\"\">Fela Kuti</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nina-simone\" title=\"\">Nina Simone</a>.

She\u2019s not often been allowed to fit in. When she moved to London and enrolled in dance college, she missed the first two weeks because her mother was looking for somewhere for them to live. Before she arrived, the teacher told the whole of her year and the year above that they had better start working, because this brilliant dancer was about to join them \u2013 twigs \u2013 and was going to wipe the floor with them. \u201cSo I turn up on my first day, in my pink leotard with my hair in a bun, with my farmer\u2019s accent, like, \u2018Hi guys!\u2019 and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018No, absolutely not.\u2019 My shoes went missing, my leotards\u2026 I think I lasted a month.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People thought I was odd-looking, until a white male validated my beauty.

(She means Pattinson.) \u201cThat\u2019s frustrating and I still don\u2019t accept it. But if I sing really well, you can\u2019t question that. If I dance well, you can\u2019t question that. If I express myself honestly, or if I\u2019m pole dancing or wushu-ing excellently, you can\u2019t question that. I\u2019ve never felt more beautiful because I\u2019ve never been more skilled. Everything else is ephemeral.\u201d</p> <p>She called her album Magdalene because of the way Mary Magdalene has been written about, she says: as a prostitute, when she was a healer and a mystic who washed Christ\u2019s feet in rare and expensive oil. \u201cAn incredible woman who was always in the shadow of a man,\u201d twigs says with irony. \u201cI can relate.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s a mass of contractions, twigs: a homebody who sparkles in the limelight, a seeker of male approval who wants to own her sexuality, a willing apprentice who\u2019s made for centre stage. And the next few years will be about her. She might be in a new relationship \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m completely open to love\u201d \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t want to compromise, to mould her life around someone else, man or child. \u201cI\u2019d like children in my late 30s,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause as a dancer, your body doesn\u2019t come back.\u201d She wants to enjoy her new strength. \u201cIt would be a shame if I didn\u2019t question what it is to be in a relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I need to do that, to grow. And to make sure when I meet someone wonderful, it can be on my own terms. I hesitate to talk to you about it, because I would love to have a piece written about me where my name is not attached to a man.\u201d</p> <p>But you were dating someone very famous, I say.</p> <p>\u201cBut my work was so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so much louder than my love life.

      "bodyText": "FKA twigs lives in a real house, in the real world, though this seems hard to believe. She appears so alien, in her music and her performances, in the way she presents herself, that you\u2019d be forgiven for believing that she lived in a cryo chamber alongside bejewelled hip-hop robots, or a martial arts monastery surrounded by an enchanted thicket of thorns. Twigs\u2019 art is not of the stripped-back, real me, acoustics-and-grubby-jeans variety. She arrived on the scene in 2012, whispering like Tricky, clattering like the xx, romancing like Prince, singing like Kate Bush, yet not actually quite like anyone else. A polymath \u2013 she is a beautiful dancer and has directed pop videos and immersive theatre \u2013 she works in experimental hinterlands, creating atmospheres rather than singalong stories. For example: the sparse and sad track Cellophane, released in April as the opening single for her new album, was accompanied by a video that featured twigs athletically pole-dancing in a sparkly bikini before being eaten by a lookalike insect, falling into watery depths and being covered in orange mud by caring tortoise creatures. Twigs is about intensity, beauty, sexuality and freakiness. Because of this, I\u2019ve geared myself up for her to be a tricky interviewee. Distant. Abstract. Maybe a bit defiant. But twigs is not like this. She is friendly and quite serious. She has a light, RP voice with a slight lisp and a young face; though she is now 31, she can seem 10 years younger, especially when she laughs. We meet in her lovely home in east London. Her sitting room is olive green, with plants and a piano, fossils and tapestries and books about jazz. Preserved snakes twist under glass domes. There is a Diptyque Feu du Bois candle burning. The vibe is part museum of curiosities, part comfy boutique hotel. Her small dog, Solo, is lounging on the rug. \u201cI found her in LA four years ago, behind a nail salon,\u201d twigs says. \u201cShe was tiny, about six months old, and all alone.\u201d (For the dog spotters: Solo enjoys chasing a ball and can do sit, paw and lie down. And, yes, she sleeps on twigs\u2019 bed.) Twigs thinks about how she presents herself. For this interview, she has dressed in an embroidered white shirt, Burberry shorts and white socks, with velvet ribbons at her throat. Her hair is partly dyed a wild red. Like the dancer she is, she\u2019s poised but casual, plonking herself on the floor (all dancers sit on the floor). Sweetly, she has three types of posh juice for me to choose from, though she herself drinks herbal tea. It\u2019s taken her some time to sort her house out; for quite a while, she just had a sofa, a bed and a TV: \u201cVery discombobulating,\u201d she says. Before that, she\u2019d been living in a rented house share, and didn\u2019t have the money to furnish her new pad, though now she does (Nike appointed her creative director for a 2017 womenswear campaign, and she\u2019s made an advert with Apple, so her money situation has improved). Anyway, even if she\u2019d had the cash, she wouldn\u2019t have been up for decorating; she has had a difficult couple of years. Though she didn\u2019t make it public \u2013 and refuses to talk about it with me \u2013 in 2017 she split up with her long-term boyfriend Robert Pattinson, the Twilight Saga actor who\u2019s set to be the next Batman. Their relationship had brought her tabloid scrutiny and weird fan abuse: Pattinson fans can be rabid, and racially trolled twigs on social media. After their split, she no longer had a home base in LA \u2013 plus she was ill (more about this later) and, most importantly for her, she was in an artistic fug. She found the new album \u2013 Magdalene, her second \u2013 really hard to make, she says, mostly because she wanted to change but couldn\u2019t figure out how. She began work on it as soon as she had finished her first, LP1, but couldn\u2019t find the right sound, and couldn\u2019t write songs in the way she wanted. Producers assumed she wanted to work with the fractured, futuristic noise of LP1 again and she felt trapped. Though she managed one song \u2013 Day Bed, which ends the album, and is about being depressed \u2013 she was stuck, workwise, in an artistry of her own making. \u201cI find it easy to write over complete musical randomness,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I wanted. I wanted something simpler, something honest. It felt like I\u2019d made this ornate golden birdcage, and everything was so intricate \u2013 like tapestries and beading and beautiful wirework. And I stepped in and I locked the door and I was like, oh my gosh, this is actually a nightmare.\u201d Her process of breaking free ended up being pretty thorough. Her music altered, her relationship ended, her health went haywire. A disciplined workaholic, twigs sees life as a matter of spinning plates \u2013 \u201cYou have family and friends, and you have adult things, like where you live and bills and stuff like that, then your health, maybe your relationship\u201d \u2013 and, for a while, around 2017, nearly all the plates dropped to the floor and smashed. \u201cEverything was in complete turmoil,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only thing that didn\u2019t get smashed or shaken was one or two great friends.\u201d Things came to a head in LA, in just one week. She\u2019d been searching for the right musical collaborator, and had found one in cult electronica artist Nicolas Jaar. They wrote Cellophane together in about 20 minutes, and she was thrilled. But she also felt physically terrible. She had a lump in her stomach that she\u2019d been ignoring for months and one day that week, she woke and found she couldn\u2019t sit up. She phoned her stepfather. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, I fucked up. I have some terrible thing in my stomach and it\u2019s really big and I must have stomach cancer and I\u2019ve not told anyone and I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any coming back.\u2019\u201d Twigs says this all in rapid-fire full tragedy mode, rolling her eyes at herself. What did your stepfather say? \u201cHe said, \u2018Go to the doctor.\u2019\u201d An ultrasound scan revealed not cancer, but fibroids \u2013 hormonal growths on her uterus. Twigs\u2019s were enormous \u2013 \u201cTwo cooking apples, three kiwis and a couple of strawberries: a fruit bowl of pain,\u201d as she described them on Instagram \u2013 and she had laparoscopic surgery, back in the UK. \u201cThey went in through three or four entry points\u201d \u2013 she points at her stomach \u2013 \u201cand pulled out the fibroids, like a string of sausages, through my bellybutton.\u201d She had been in pain for a while; plus the fibroids had been pressing down on her bowel and bladder, making her want to pee all the time and giving her unpleasant IBS symptoms. She remembers working on a video before the operation. \u201cI had to do voguing in it and the choreographers, these two women, weren\u2019t very nice and said, \u2018You\u2019re really lazy and you keep going to the toilet all the time.\u2019 My whole life, I\u2019d never been called lazy. It made me break down.\u201d As if to prove how un-lazy she is, a few weeks after the operation she got a call from the director Spike Jonze. He wanted her to audition for an ad he was making for Apple\u2019s HomePod. For the audition, she had to dance around this very room in front of her laptop, hoping her stitches wouldn\u2019t split. \u201cThen they said, \u2018That\u2019s great. Now can you do it again and, like, touch the objects in the room?\u2019\u201d She laughs. But being a pro \u2013 she had spent years as a dancer for hire \u2013 she did as they asked. \u201cI was like, \u2018Sure, from the beginning of the song or halfway through? No problem. You want it again, but in a crop top?\u2019\u201d She\u2019s joking, but both incidents indicate the same thing about her. Twigs is a worker. She moved to London from Cheltenham when she was 17 and spent a few years as a back-up dancer, hired to shimmy behind stars such as Ed Sheeran, Kylie Minogue and Jessie J. Even now that she\u2019s an artist in her own right, she flips between being in charge, as a musician and director, and being directed, when she\u2019s dancing. She\u2019s more inclined to the former, though doesn\u2019t mind being told what to do if she\u2019s learning and she thinks the work is good. She likes collaboration, and \u201cI have a good taste barometer\u201d. Anyhow, she wants to talk more about fibroids, because she had never heard of them until she got them, even though many women suffer with them, especially women of Caribbean origin (twigs is half Jamaican). She\u2019s learned that they can be managed through stress management and diet: it\u2019s important to avoid sugar and foods with oestrogen, she says \u2013 soy, dairy, non-organic meat. Also, receipts. Receipts? I say, wondering if I\u2019ve heard her wrong. \u201cYes. The paper they use, the ink, there\u2019s something about it that\u2019s got a lot of oestrogen and you ingest it through your skin.\u201d Hmm, I say, but when I check later, I discover twigs is right: receipt ink contains BPA, an artificial oestrogen, which can be absorbed through contact. God, what a tricky thing. She also avoids tap water, because it has traces of the pill in it, and can\u2019t use hormonal contraception: \u201cI\u2019m a believer in western medicine, but there are other ways, depending on how your body works.\u201d She has been really careful, but still her fibroids grew back within three months. Now she has six more, which she is managing. \u201cAs soon as I had my operation, I felt so much better,\u201d she says, \u201clike all these trapped-up feelings were released. But I\u2019ve never felt the same since. I\u2019m different.\u201d She has thrown herself into getting immensely fit. She knew that she wanted to pole dance for the video for Cellophane and it took her six months of training to get strong enough to do it. She is a true athlete now: she has learned how to do an aerial cartwheel, she is proficient in a type of sword kung fu called wushu, which she\u2019s been using in her live shows. She chose to learn this, she tells me, because it\u2019s the opposite of pole dancing, very grounded and \u201cweighted in the pelvis\u201d, requiring her to use her legs. She is stronger than she\u2019s ever been. I do wonder about the pole dancing. She\u2019s done it before, in the video for Fukk Sleep, an A$AP Rocky song she guested on, where it was more straightforwardly man-pleasing. But twigs has always explored her sexuality in her work and tells me, \u201cMy sexuality tank and my creativity tank are the same tank, which is great, but also quite frustrating.\u201d If she\u2019s feeling sexually confused or uninspired, then her work is off; but equally, if her work is good, then she feels strong and sexual. In the Cellophane video, she is unbelievably sexy, but her needy lyrics \u2013 \u201cDidn\u2019t I do it for you? Why don\u2019t I do it for you?\u201d \u2013 play against this. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cI think that, in society, as a woman, you can be this beautiful creature and you want to be that for yourself, but there\u2019s also a part of you that is doing it for the approval of the opposite sex. And that can lead you to feeling, \u2018Am I good enough? Have I done enough?\u2019\u201d If it seems a bit extreme \u2013 twirling around a pole in the full splits position just to get a man to think you\u2019re great \u2013 well, twigs has started asking questions about such things. She watched the great Kathy Burke TV series All Woman, which she loved, and she\u2019s been noticing how women often do the \u201cemotional labour\u201d of a relationship, what she calls \u201clearned behaviour\u201d. To her chagrin, she is often referred to in terms of her boyfriends (since Pattinson, she\u2019s been linked with another actor, Shia LaBeouf, and is dating Reuben Esser, fashion editor of Another Man magazine). It irritates her, but she is also conflicted about relationships in general. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been indoctrinated to feel like when I\u2019m with a man, things are better,\u201d she says, \u201cregardless of whether they are or not. I\u2019ve been made to feel like, if I\u2019m with a man, then I\u2019m doing the right thing, I\u2019m validated, I have a tick to my name. And even though I don\u2019t really believe that, because I\u2019m intelligent and I understand things, it\u2019s somewhere inside me.\u201d *** Twigs grew up in Cheltenham as Tahliah Debrett Barnett, the only child of an English-Spanish single mother from Birmingham, who\u2019d moved out to the countryside to give her daughter a better life. And it was, twigs says; she loved being outside, she enjoyed nature. The walls and ceilings of her room were painted dark blue, with stars and moons on them. As a child, she had a great imagination \u2013 \u201cIt was on fleek!\u201d she says \u2013 and often mixed up daydreams and reality: until she was about 12, she sort of believed she could fly and hang in the air, simply by jumping off the stairs. Clever and hard-working, she got a scholarship to a private all-girls Catholic secondary school, which she enjoyed while feeling entirely different from everyone else. There were no other mixed-race students. Her stepfather, who moved in when she was little, was one of the few black people in her life. When he gave lifts to her friends, she was embarrassed by the music he played in the car: acid jazz, real jazz, Fela Kuti, Nina Simone. She would ask him to play the radio instead, though he never did. Her mother took pains to make her feel beautiful, telling her her hair was lovely and her skin colour was gorgeous, but she didn\u2019t feel it. \u201cShe\u2019d pump me up at home and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yes, I am pretty\u2019 and I\u2019d get dressed up and think, \u2018Yes, I feel good.\u2019 And then I\u2019d go to the school disco and as soon as I got there I\u2019d want the floor to eat me, because all my friends had this perfectly straight blond highlighted hair.\u201d When, aged 15, she asked her friend to come with her to a bashment party called Jamaican Club in Gloucester, her friend only came once, because, she told twigs, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable as the only white person there. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018That\u2019s how I feel every day at school!\u2019\u201d Twigs says, almost laughing with outrage. \u201cI got angry. \u2018That\u2019s how I feel when I go to your brother\u2019s house party and it\u2019s all Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College girls. When I go round people\u2019s houses and they\u2019ve got swimming pools and ponies in the back yard!\u2019\u201d There is something about twigs that will always feel other, even now. She\u2019s not often been allowed to fit in. When she moved to London and enrolled in dance college, she missed the first two weeks because her mother was looking for somewhere for them to live. Before she arrived, the teacher told the whole of her year and the year above that they had better start working, because this brilliant dancer was about to join them \u2013 twigs \u2013 and was going to wipe the floor with them. \u201cSo I turn up on my first day, in my pink leotard with my hair in a bun, with my farmer\u2019s accent, like, \u2018Hi guys!\u2019 and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018No, absolutely not.\u2019 My shoes went missing, my leotards\u2026 I think I lasted a month.\u201d She went to Croydon College to do six (six!) A-levels \u2013 sociology, psychology, fine art, English literature, philosophy, French \u2013 but found it hard moving into a class of 30 kids when, at her previous school, there were only 12. Everything was confused and confusing: she remembers going into an exam, looking at a question and thinking, \u201cWe haven\u2019t been taught this.\u201d After college, she wanted to get into the music industry, but couldn\u2019t work out how you did it. So she was a youth worker in Borough and Tower Bridge, a shot girl at Tiger Tiger. She continued with her dancing. Then, when she was 24, a photographer spotted her and put her on the cover of style magazine i-D. She got a manager who started teaming her up with producers \u2013 surprisingly, she learned songwriting for a time with Mike Chapman, veteran of the Sweet (she tells me he taught her how to structure a song) \u2013 and finally, she released the four-track EP1, in 2012. Every track was accompanied by a video, directed by her. It\u2019s been a while since twigs has been asked to look so far back, and she is different now, she says. \u201cI was a young woman, stepping into my sexuality and owning it. I was sassy! Coming from the outside and being alternative. Not like a Nubian queen, not a powerful goddess \u2013 but something just as powerful, but fractured. Like in Japan, where they smash the pots but join them up again with gold.\u201d Now, though less sassy, she still feels good. \u201cPeople thought I was quite odd-looking, until a white male validated my beauty,\u201d she says. (She means Pattinson.) \u201cThat\u2019s frustrating and I still don\u2019t accept it. But if I sing really well, you can\u2019t question that. If I dance well, you can\u2019t question that. If I express myself honestly, or if I\u2019m pole dancing or wushu-ing excellently, you can\u2019t question that. I\u2019ve never felt more beautiful because I\u2019ve never been more skilled. Everything else is ephemeral.\u201d She called her album Magdalene because of the way Mary Magdalene has been written about, she says: as a prostitute, when she was a healer and a mystic who washed Christ\u2019s feet in rare and expensive oil. \u201cAn incredible woman who was always in the shadow of a man,\u201d twigs says with irony. \u201cI can relate.\u201d She\u2019s a mass of contractions, twigs: a homebody who sparkles in the limelight, a seeker of male approval who wants to own her sexuality, a willing apprentice who\u2019s made for centre stage. And the next few years will be about her. She might be in a new relationship \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m completely open to love\u201d \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t want to compromise, to mould her life around someone else, man or child. \u201cI\u2019d like children in my late 30s,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause as a dancer, your body doesn\u2019t come back.\u201d She wants to enjoy her new strength. \u201cIt would be a shame if I didn\u2019t question what it is to be in a relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I need to do that, to grow. And to make sure when I meet someone wonderful, it can be on my own terms. I hesitate to talk to you about it, because I would love to have a piece written about me where my name is not attached to a man.\u201d But you were dating someone very famous, I say. \u201cBut my work was so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so much louder than my love life. It is so much louder.\u201d \u2022 The album Magdalene is out on 25 October.

      "bodyText": "Devendra Amgai lost his job in November. The 42-year-old public health professional was working in one of Nepal\u2019s more remote districts, distributing contraceptives to women. The project was proving successful. With little alternative access to medicines or healthcare, local women were seeking out the clinic in ever-increasing numbers. Yet four months before Amgai\u2019s contract was due to end, the district office in Rasuwa was closed. \u201cI was not prepared for it. I have two small kids and my wife does not work. I am the only one who earns money,\u201d he says. Amgai was one of 150 Family Planning Association Nepal (FPAN) staff to lose their jobs over the past year because of Donald Trump\u2019s reinstatement of the Mexico City policy \u2013 or the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d. Two and a half years after it was reintroduced, the rule is starting to have a profound effect across Nepal. Under the policy, any organisation outside the US receiving American funding has to agree not to carry out abortions or even use money sourced from elsewhere to do any work associated with terminations, including talking about them. A report published by the Centre for Research on Environment Health and Population Activities and the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition said the rule threatened Nepal\u2019s progress in improving its reproductive health services, and would damage any future programmes across the country. The scheme Amgai worked on, the support for international family planning organisations 2 (Sifpo) project, received $5.5m (\u00a34.5m) funding from USAid. It was launched in 2015 with 150 staff and 270 paid community volunteers running mobile outreach services from government health facilities in 11 districts. More than 233,000 people have benefited from the programme. The director general of FPAN, KP Bista, says although the four-year project was due to end in March this year, \u201cwe were pressurised to close it sooner\u201d. \u201cWe tried our best to save our staff\u2019s jobs and the four new branch offices \u2026 but we did not get money from anywhere.\u201d Bista added: \u201cFPAN is in a real crisis. This year, we will hardly be able to provide half of the services that [we have] in past years.\u201d FPAN is Nepal\u2019s oldest NGO and a major partner in the government\u2019s national family planning programmes. It started family planning services in 1959, before the ministry of health was even formed. It is a member association of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), which has refused to sign up to the gag rule and lost millions in funding as a result. \u201cWe need around $9m to fully operate all our programmes and branches but now we are running only a $4m budget. We got core funding from the International Planned Parenthood Federation, but even IPPF is cutting our money every year. This year we got only around $1.2m and last year we received $1.5m, which is not even enough to run our offices,\u201d says Bista. The cuts are a direct result of the global gag rule, he says. The lack of money has meant it can\u2019t partner with the government to set up family planning centres in 20 districts this year. Bista added: \u201cThe truth is we have not allocated budget for [all FPAN] staff salaries for this October, November and December because we don\u2019t have budget.\u201d As well as the 150 Sifpo job losses, more than 100 staff vacancies have not been refilled. \u201cWe all know USAid is the biggest funder, but the door to get their money is closed to us due to the gag rule.\u201d Nepal legalised abortion in 2002 and has relatively liberal laws. Terminations are available up to 12 weeks on request, and up to 18 weeks in cases of rape or incest, and at any time if the pregnancy poses a danger to the woman\u2019s life, her physical or mental health or if there is a foetal abnormality.

The work of Jagriti Mahila Maha Sang (JMMS), a large network of female sex workers, is being restricted by the global gag. It is not able to provide information most needed by sex workers because it is funded by Fhi360, which in turn is funded by USAid. A former staff member at JMMS member organisation, Rama Pradhan (name changed) says she was \u201cstrictly restricted in talking about abortion or related topics by her office\u201d. A former sex worker turned social worker, she says: \u201cI used to feel so bad when I was unable to give the information which was most important to them.

Due process has not been followed and the timing is overtly political.\u201d</p> <p>The legislation that created the role decrees that the mayor of London, a job Johnson held from 2008 to 2016, is subject to a special standards framework, and that claims of alleged wrongdoing are thus passed to the IOPC.</p> <p>The referral follows allegations first reported by the Sunday Times that when he was mayor he failed to declare close personal links to Arcuri when she received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips.</p> <p>Johnson has declined to comment in detail on the claims, including that a company run by Arcuri received access to money to assist her business, as well as places on trade trips, at times following the intervention of mayoral officials. The prime minister has said only that he rejects any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The Sunday Times also reported that Johnson was, at the time, a regular visitor to Arcuri\u2019s east London apartment, and that she described him at the time as \u201cone of my best friends\u201d.</p> <p>Separately, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is investigating how Arcuri\u2019s most recent company won a \u00a3100,000 government cyber skills grant intended to assist UK firms, even though she has now returned to live in the US.</p> <p>The letter informed Johnson that Michael Lockwood, director-general of the IOPC, would assess \u201cwhether or not it is necessary for the matter to be investigated in accordance with the relevant regulations\u201d.</p> <p>It went on: \u201cThe conduct matter relates to your time as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016. During this time it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits.\u201d</p> <p>The letter details the allegations, saying there was an obligation to examine any indications \u201cthat a relevant office holder may have committed a criminal offence\u201d.</p> <p>The referral does not mean a full investigation, or a prosecution, will take place, and misconduct in public office is known as a complex area to prosecute. A criminal offence under common law, it penalises official wrongdoing that can be deliberate, deceitful or simply amount to excessive neglect of duty.</p> <p>The government source said no evidence had been provided by the monitoring officer, \u201cnor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night\u201d.</p> <p>They added: \u201cThe public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.\u201d</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister as mayor of London did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been formally referred for potential investigation into whether he committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office, over allegations about a conflict of interest with a US businesswoman while he was mayor of London. An official from the Greater London Authority, the city\u2019s devolved government, has written to the prime minister noting claims he had \u201con more than one occasion\u201d used his position as mayor to \u201cbenefit and reward\u201d Jennifer Arcuri, a tech entrepreneur. \u201cSubject to any explanation provided by you, these matters give rise to a suggestion that there has been a failure to safeguard the public purse and if so that amounts to a significant breach of public trust,\u201d said the letter, from the office of the authority\u2019s monitoring officer. \u201cThese are the ingredients of the offence of misconduct in a public office.\u201d Johnson has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which investigates complaints of misconduct connected to police in England and Wales. The matter has been sent to the IOPC because, as mayor, Johnson was also the head of the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime, a role equivalent to police and crime commissioner for the capital. A senior government source said Johnson was given no warning of the announcement: \u201cThis is a politically motivated attack. Due process has not been followed and the timing is overtly political.\u201d The legislation that created the role decrees that the mayor of London, a job Johnson held from 2008 to 2016, is subject to a special standards framework, and that claims of alleged wrongdoing are thus passed to the IOPC. The referral follows allegations first reported by the Sunday Times that when he was mayor he failed to declare close personal links to Arcuri when she received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips. Johnson has declined to comment in detail on the claims, including that a company run by Arcuri received access to money to assist her business, as well as places on trade trips, at times following the intervention of mayoral officials. The prime minister has said only that he rejects any wrongdoing. The Sunday Times also reported that Johnson was, at the time, a regular visitor to Arcuri\u2019s east London apartment, and that she described him at the time as \u201cone of my best friends\u201d. Separately, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is investigating how Arcuri\u2019s most recent company won a \u00a3100,000 government cyber skills grant intended to assist UK firms, even though she has now returned to live in the US. The letter informed Johnson that Michael Lockwood, director-general of the IOPC, would assess \u201cwhether or not it is necessary for the matter to be investigated in accordance with the relevant regulations\u201d. It went on: \u201cThe conduct matter relates to your time as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016. During this time it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits.\u201d The letter details the allegations, saying there was an obligation to examine any indications \u201cthat a relevant office holder may have committed a criminal offence\u201d. The referral does not mean a full investigation, or a prosecution, will take place, and misconduct in public office is known as a complex area to prosecute. A criminal offence under common law, it penalises official wrongdoing that can be deliberate, deceitful or simply amount to excessive neglect of duty. The government source said no evidence had been provided by the monitoring officer, \u201cnor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night\u201d. They added: \u201cThe public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.\u201d A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister as mayor of London did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Barney Ronay, chief sports writer</h2> <p>My summer started in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/26/eight-degrees-windy-durham-cricket-season-2019\">chill of Durham in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/26/eight-degrees-windy-durham-cricket-season-2019\">March</a>, the earliest ever day of first class cricket in England, then finished in the dead heat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/13/sam-curran-england-ashes-steve-smith-barney-ronay\">Oval Ashes Test in mid-September</a>. The dominant memory is looking down from the press box at Lord\u2019s as the World Cup final reached its brain-mangling climax and seeing people writhing and leaping about at every ball \u2013 then turning back to the sober, jaded sporting press and seeing exactly the same contortions. Loved the sandwich tour of England, the Anglo-subcontinental World Cup crowds, the wild highs next to the comforting tedium of the drab days. The summer proved one thing. Cricket remains the greatest sport. It\u2019s not broken. You just need to let people see it.</p> <h2>Ali Martin, cricket news reporter</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/diversity-strength-england-win-cricket-world-cup\">England\u2019s epic World Cup win</a> and the gripping Ashes series that followed made the home summer of 2019 a career highlight for those of us lucky enough to be at the coalface.</p> <p>There were nearly 100 days of international cricket, from England\u2019s men playing a one-off ODI against Ireland in Malahide on 3 May through to their Ashes-series-levelling win at the Oval on 15 September, not to mention countless training days and press conferences. The Guardian has been present throughout and I hope the readers enjoyed our stories and coverage.</p> <p>As well as sharing a press box with the ever-upbeat Vic Marks and the rest of the team, it has been a pleasure to work with Moeen Ali <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/moeen-ali\">on his column</a>.

Having exclusively covered the women\u2019s game this season, it feels like there\u2019s more to worry about than there is to celebrate: the gap in investment between English and Australian women\u2019s cricket <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/26/england-australia-womens-ashes-t20-cricket-match-report\">laid bare in a one-sided Ashes series</a>; the ending of the 50-over Women\u2019s County Championship, with still not much certainty about what will replace it; and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/kia-super-league-starts\">last ever Kia Super League</a>, with the Hundred roundly booed on Finals Day. A warning to anyone getting carried away on the back of the men\u2019s World Cup win: of course enjoy it, but the party won\u2019t last for ever \u2013 ours certainly didn\u2019t.</p> <h2>Andy Bull, senior sports writer</h2> <p>As I write, I\u2019m in Japan, waiting for the start of England\u2019s first rugby World Cup match. Things move on quickly in sport, and the cricket season already feels a very long way away. But there are little bits of it still so clear in my mind that if I shut my eyes I can picture every last detail about them. I can hear the noise in the press box in the final moments of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/lords-perfect-venue-greatest-one-day-game-ever-played\">World Cup final at Lord\u2019s</a>, which is usually quiet as a library, as all us English journalists started shouting like little children. I told myself then that if it was the last match I ever covered I\u2019d be happy enough.

      "bodyText": "Barney Ronay, chief sports writer My summer started in the chill of Durham in March, the earliest ever day of first class cricket in England, then finished in the dead heat of the Oval Ashes Test in mid-September. The dominant memory is looking down from the press box at Lord\u2019s as the World Cup final reached its brain-mangling climax and seeing people writhing and leaping about at every ball \u2013 then turning back to the sober, jaded sporting press and seeing exactly the same contortions. Loved the sandwich tour of England, the Anglo-subcontinental World Cup crowds, the wild highs next to the comforting tedium of the drab days. The summer proved one thing. Cricket remains the greatest sport. It\u2019s not broken. You just need to let people see it. Ali Martin, cricket news reporter England\u2019s epic World Cup win and the gripping Ashes series that followed made the home summer of 2019 a career highlight for those of us lucky enough to be at the coalface. There were nearly 100 days of international cricket, from England\u2019s men playing a one-off ODI against Ireland in Malahide on 3 May through to their Ashes-series-levelling win at the Oval on 15 September, not to mention countless training days and press conferences. The Guardian has been present throughout and I hope the readers enjoyed our stories and coverage. As well as sharing a press box with the ever-upbeat Vic Marks and the rest of the team, it has been a pleasure to work with Moeen Ali on his column. He has provided unique insight and his piece after the World Cup final \u2013 spoken from the heart and explaining the strength that Eoin Morgan\u2019s squad found in their diversity \u2013 was a personal favourite. Raf Nicholson, women\u2019s cricket writer For a women\u2019s cricket writer, there\u2019s a certain amount of cognitive dissonance when I hear people proclaiming what a brilliant summer it\u2019s been for cricket. Having exclusively covered the women\u2019s game this season, it feels like there\u2019s more to worry about than there is to celebrate: the gap in investment between English and Australian women\u2019s cricket laid bare in a one-sided Ashes series; the ending of the 50-over Women\u2019s County Championship, with still not much certainty about what will replace it; and the last ever Kia Super League, with the Hundred roundly booed on Finals Day. A warning to anyone getting carried away on the back of the men\u2019s World Cup win: of course enjoy it, but the party won\u2019t last for ever \u2013 ours certainly didn\u2019t. Andy Bull, senior sports writer As I write, I\u2019m in Japan, waiting for the start of England\u2019s first rugby World Cup match. Things move on quickly in sport, and the cricket season already feels a very long way away. But there are little bits of it still so clear in my mind that if I shut my eyes I can picture every last detail about them. I can hear the noise in the press box in the final moments of the World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, which is usually quiet as a library, as all us English journalists started shouting like little children. I told myself then that if it was the last match I ever covered I\u2019d be happy enough. And then, six weeks later, it was better again when Ben Stokes played that innings at Headingley. I can feel the rush of blood I suffered in those last few overs, and see the look I swapped with my colleague Vic Marks as we both realised we were going to have to tear up everything we\u2019d already written and start over again. This one time, I don\u2019t think either of us really minded. Vic Marks, cricket correspondent It\u2019s been a brilliant summer for cricket, which should help to invigorate the game.

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re reading this, chances are you read a fair amount of film criticism: the trusty, fusty written type, whether in print or online, that has served us well for years. I\u2019m certainly glad you do. Yet film criticism is evolving and diversifying as fast as any form of journalism, finding new audiovisual ways to reach the less reading-inclined \u2013 which, given that film is an audiovisual medium itself, frankly seems fair enough.</p> <p>The art of the critical video essay isn\u2019t exactly about reviewing: rather, it\u2019s a versatile form that enables both serious film scholars and curious film-makers to explore cinema in more idiosyncratic and sensory ways than the written word necessarily permits. You might not read a written essay about the significance of ties in David Fincher\u2019s <em>Zodiac</em>, yet a short video examination on the same topic \u2013 to use a <a href=\"http://www.thelmagazine.com/2010/04/the-ties-of-zodiac/\" title=\"\">favourite example</a> from the earlier days of the form \u2013 can be oddly hypnotic. The video essay can be two minutes long or the length of a feature film itself; the internet is full of them, usually free to view.</p> <p>For those new to the idea of video criticism, BBC iPlayer\u2019s current <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p07f7m9q/inside-cinema\" title=\"\">Inside Cinema</a></em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p07f7m9q/inside-cinema\" title=\"\"> series</a> of shorts provides a bright, accessible introduction to the form. A range of mostly British film critics has been commissioned to write and narrate a series of brief video essays, four to six minutes in length, on film fixations and fetishes of their choosing.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re reading this, chances are you read a fair amount of film criticism: the trusty, fusty written type, whether in print or online, that has served us well for years. I\u2019m certainly glad you do. Yet film criticism is evolving and diversifying as fast as any form of journalism, finding new audiovisual ways to reach the less reading-inclined \u2013 which, given that film is an audiovisual medium itself, frankly seems fair enough. The art of the critical video essay isn\u2019t exactly about reviewing: rather, it\u2019s a versatile form that enables both serious film scholars and curious film-makers to explore cinema in more idiosyncratic and sensory ways than the written word necessarily permits. You might not read a written essay about the significance of ties in David Fincher\u2019s Zodiac, yet a short video examination on the same topic \u2013 to use a favourite example from the earlier days of the form \u2013 can be oddly hypnotic. The video essay can be two minutes long or the length of a feature film itself; the internet is full of them, usually free to view. For those new to the idea of video criticism, BBC iPlayer\u2019s current Inside Cinema series of shorts provides a bright, accessible introduction to the form. A range of mostly British film critics has been commissioned to write and narrate a series of brief video essays, four to six minutes in length, on film fixations and fetishes of their choosing. The results, while pithy, are thoughtful and often inventively offbeat, counting on well-chosen clips and fragments to illustrate their argument in tandem with their own critical insights. So we get the Observer\u2019s own Simran Hans musing with affection on the creative relationship between Meg Ryan and Nora Ephron; Christina Newland exploring the political fractures of Nixon\u2019s America through the prism of 1970s cinema; or the Irish critic Jessica Kiang examining the trope of space-travelling dads in everything from Star Wars to Ad Astra \u2013 the unlikely five-minute film essay that leaves a lump in your throat.

      "body": "<p>The buzz phrase among a small army of biotech companies looking to get a foothold in the ever-expanding health market is \u201cpersonalised medicine\u201d or, as it\u2019s also known, \u201cprecision medicine\u201d. At the core of this concept is the understanding that we are all different, with different biological make-ups and different environments. Therefore a one-size-fits-all approach to diagnostics and treatment is long out of date.</p> <p>One of our most important areas of difference, and certainly the one that is increasingly subject to scientific scientific analysis, is our personal genome. The 21st-century revolution in genetics has been as dramatic as that seen in computer technology. The first human genome to be sequenced took 13 years. It can now be done in a day. The genetic information that cost about \u00a32bn to extract in 1990 can now be got for a couple of hundred pounds.</p> <p>All of which has led to a huge expansion in genetic research, as well as the arrival of private firms offering direct-to-consumer genetic profiles. But what does it amount to? Are we on the verge of a new era of bespoke medicine, in which each of us is treated as biologically unique with our particular genetic profile determining precisely what care we receive? Or does all the hype conceal a far more limited vista? And what ethical concerns involved in sharing our most essential information, our very own genetic code?</p> <p>\u201cThere are conditions, particularly rare diseases such as childhood developmental disorders, where genome sequencing is extremely beneficial, and may even be life-saving for some individuals,\u201d says Caroline Wright, senior lecturer in genomics at the University of Exeter. \u201cThere are also conditions \u2013 many common diseases, for example \u2013 where there is currently no evidence that genome sequencing is beneficial to individuals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66a34394d7f27b225b62dd115550d5164beb3e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66a34394d7f27b225b62dd115550d5164beb3e46/0_0_2399_2023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of 23andMe\u2019s saliva sample kits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"843\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of 23andMe\u2019s saliva sample kits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this year, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, got into hot water <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/20/health-secretary-matt-hancock-wants-nhs-to-rollout-genetic-tests-to-detect-diseases\" title=\"\">when he announced plans</a> for predictive tests for common cancers and heart disease to be introduced by the NHS without delay. He said: \u201cEvery genome sequence moves us a step closer to unlocking life-saving treatments.\u201d </p> <p>He cited his own experience of having his genome sequenced. He found he had a higher than average predisposition to prostate cancer, so he went to his doctor for a test.</p> <p>But critics argued that Hancock had misinterpreted his risk and unnecessarily burdened the NHS with his concerns.</p> <p>\u201cScreening healthy people using any type of technology is likely to falsely identify individuals as having \u2013 or being at risk of developing \u2013 diseases they don\u2019t have and won\u2019t get, causing them psychological and often physical harm, and costing the NHS quite a bit in unnecessary testing and potentially treatment,\u201d says Wright. \u201cA national health service should be primarily for proven tests and treatments, which includes genome sequencing in certain cases.\u201d</p> <p>But even critics of Hancock\u2019s plan, such as Anneke Lucassen, professor of clinical genetics at the University of Southampton, do see the need for greater sequencing, in particular from a more diverse range of people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our DNA should be a powerful tool in moving towards proactive rather than reactive healthcare</p> <footer> <cite>Patrick Short, chief executive of Sano</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have nearly enough evidence yet of what genomic variants do in different contexts, and we need much more research before we can realistically use much of this in healthcare,\u201d says Lucassen. \u201cAs we have very little data about anything other than northern European ancestral genetic variation, we urgently need to find out more about other ancestries.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the available genome data at presently available comes from the government-backed <a href=\"https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/the-100000-genomes-project/\" title=\"\">100,000 Genomes Project</a>, which has sequenced genomes from NHS patients affected by rare diseases or cancer, making the results available to approved researchers. More controversially, private companies have taken advantage of the cheapness of sequencing, offering simple kits direct to consumers.</p> <p>A recent arrival is <a href=\"https://sanogenetics.com/\" title=\"\">Sano</a>, a startup in Cambridge Science Park. Unlike some more established names, such as <a href=\"https://www.23andme.com/en-gb/\" title=\"\">23andme</a>, which offer general sequencing reports, Sano seeks to act as a matchmaker between people with particular conditions (or a genetic predisposition to them) and researchers in related fields.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Patrick Short, 28, is from North Carolina. He did his doctorate in mathematical genomics and medicine at Cambridge University and set up Sano three years ago with two fellow PhD students. He says there are three main phases in the advancement of personalised medicine. First, improved diagnosis, then improved treatment as a result of better diagnosis. And the third stage, he says, will be much earlier detection and prevention.</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of the great promises of genetic medicine,\u201d Short says. \u201cBecause our DNA does not change through our lives, our DNA \u2013 along with information about our environment and behaviour \u2013 should be a powerful tool for moving towards proactive rather than reactive healthcare.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"473d3863953cdfbbb20a9a9544b86f97d32bd116\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/473d3863953cdfbbb20a9a9544b86f97d32bd116/0_53_1039_1297/801.jpg\" alt=\"Analysis from Genomapp on a smartphone.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Analysis from Genomapp on a smartphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blackzheep/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, because our DNA is key to who we are, thatandwith our genome our private code, there is a lot of sensitivity about the protection of genetic information. Developments in the field have given rise to several ethical issues. In terms of identification, in America there have been cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/01/how-home-dna-tests-are-solving-cold-cases-golden-state-killer\" title=\"\">DNA samples being traced</a>, via close matches on genomics websites, to relations of a suspect in a crime, and this has led to arrests. It\u2019s just one of the more dramatic ways that our genetic data, once in the public realm, can affect not just ourselves but others.</p> <p>Looking to the future, there are concerns that health insurers and employers may demand or get access to personal genetic data. Even today there are fears that DNA information is being traded without the knowledge or informed consent of the consumer (as often consent is buried deep within long-winded agreement forms).</p> <p>However, Jeffrey Skopek, a lecturer in medical law and ethics at the University of Cambridge, questions the belief that all things genetic require greater protection than other information \u2013 a belief he terms \u201cgenetic exceptionalism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of information about ourselves that is health-related, from which health inferences can be drawn, which we expose to the world and our employers all the time,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt could be the case, for example, that algorithms looking at your Facebook likes will be able to predict health outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>Sano, which offers personalised reports based on genome sequencing, prides itself on leaving consumers in charge of their data, so nothing is passed on for research purposes, even anonymously, without signed agreement. Short says: \u201cWe built our platform specifically to allow participants to have full control over data use.\u201d </p> <p>The default setting on Sano\u2019s website is to ask for consent each time the consumer supplies new information, to avoid the danger of anyone accidentally making their data open-access.</p> <p>Short believes consumers have been misled by many genetic testing companies, which, he says, \u201coften sacrifice scientific integrity to sell kits\u201d. There have been cases of false positives, where consumers were led to believe they were predisposed to a condition, and false negatives where the consumer was wrongly given an all clear. Such mistakes have occurred partly because most sequencing tests analyse a tiny fraction of DNA, and thus may pick up some mutations without noticing others. Also interpretation of genetic information is complex and requires a sophisticated understanding of a person\u2019s genome and environment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are concerns that arise when the physician is out of the equation</p> <footer> <cite>Jeffrey Skopek, lecturer in medical law and ethics</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the US, 23andMe had its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval withdrawn for a couple of years, following concern about inaccurate results. It was reinstated after the company took steps to meet FDA regulations. Now the firm focuses on a selection of conditions for which there are known genetic markers, such as type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and coeliac disease, and emphasises that these markers only influence your chances of developing a condition.</p> <p>In July, Dante Labs launched a consumer genetic testing service. A \u201csuper premium, whole genome\u201d <a href=\"https://www.dantelabs.com/products/whole-genome-sequencing?variant=29983752093740\" title=\"\">sequencing test</a>on samples sent to its lab in L\u2019Aquila, near Rome, currently costs \u20ac599 (\u00a3500). For this sum users receive a \u201cfull check-up for all common and rare diseases\u201d.</p> <p>Sano, Dante, 23andMe and other testing companies allow users to download their raw data. They can upload this to a third party site such as <a href=\"https://genomapp.com/en/\" title=\"\">Genomapp</a> for further interpretation. In the case of Genomapp you will be informed via its app about your risk of developing some 300 conditions and diseases.</p> <p>So while the testing companies may try to ensure they deliver information to their customers in a responsible way, there is nothing to stop users shopping their data around for further analysis. As Skopek notes: \u201cThere\u2019s a certain set of concerns that arise when the physician is out of the equation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9bb74426bb8b2c983a1e7a34e2913695f74b7ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9bb74426bb8b2c983a1e7a34e2913695f74b7ed/0_207_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sano\u2019s saliva testing kit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sano\u2019s saliva testing kit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sano Genetics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sano aims to provide a next-generation sequencing service, with genetic counsellors available, a doctor involved and good links to the NHS. But that is only an aim, and not a plan Short expects to see realised for at least a year. Given the time it takes to form working relationships, even a year may be highly optimistic.</p> <p>In the meantime, says Short, Sano is offering three types of testing kit. Its Genotyping kit, costing \u00a3125, analyses less than 0.02% of a person\u2019s DNA. Exome Plus measures up to 2% of your DNA and costs \u00a3450. For \u00a3950 you can get all your DNA measured with the Whole Genome option.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority of our research projects are connecting people who already have a condition diagnosed,\u201d says Short. So people with psoriatic arthritis can, as Short puts it, \u201ccontribute to research and learn more about how genetics might affect severity\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The buzz phrase among a small army of biotech companies looking to get a foothold in the ever-expanding health market is \u201cpersonalised medicine\u201d or, as it\u2019s also known, \u201cprecision medicine\u201d. At the core of this concept is the understanding that we are all different, with different biological make-ups and different environments. Therefore a one-size-fits-all approach to diagnostics and treatment is long out of date. One of our most important areas of difference, and certainly the one that is increasingly subject to scientific scientific analysis, is our personal genome. The 21st-century revolution in genetics has been as dramatic as that seen in computer technology. The first human genome to be sequenced took 13 years. It can now be done in a day. The genetic information that cost about \u00a32bn to extract in 1990 can now be got for a couple of hundred pounds. All of which has led to a huge expansion in genetic research, as well as the arrival of private firms offering direct-to-consumer genetic profiles. But what does it amount to? Are we on the verge of a new era of bespoke medicine, in which each of us is treated as biologically unique with our particular genetic profile determining precisely what care we receive? Or does all the hype conceal a far more limited vista? And what ethical concerns involved in sharing our most essential information, our very own genetic code? \u201cThere are conditions, particularly rare diseases such as childhood developmental disorders, where genome sequencing is extremely beneficial, and may even be life-saving for some individuals,\u201d says Caroline Wright, senior lecturer in genomics at the University of Exeter. \u201cThere are also conditions \u2013 many common diseases, for example \u2013 where there is currently no evidence that genome sequencing is beneficial to individuals.\u201d Earlier this year, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, got into hot water when he announced plans for predictive tests for common cancers and heart disease to be introduced by the NHS without delay. He said: \u201cEvery genome sequence moves us a step closer to unlocking life-saving treatments.\u201d He cited his own experience of having his genome sequenced. He found he had a higher than average predisposition to prostate cancer, so he went to his doctor for a test. But critics argued that Hancock had misinterpreted his risk and unnecessarily burdened the NHS with his concerns. \u201cScreening healthy people using any type of technology is likely to falsely identify individuals as having \u2013 or being at risk of developing \u2013 diseases they don\u2019t have and won\u2019t get, causing them psychological and often physical harm, and costing the NHS quite a bit in unnecessary testing and potentially treatment,\u201d says Wright. \u201cA national health service should be primarily for proven tests and treatments, which includes genome sequencing in certain cases.\u201d But even critics of Hancock\u2019s plan, such as Anneke Lucassen, professor of clinical genetics at the University of Southampton, do see the need for greater sequencing, in particular from a more diverse range of people. \u201cWe don\u2019t have nearly enough evidence yet of what genomic variants do in different contexts, and we need much more research before we can realistically use much of this in healthcare,\u201d says Lucassen. \u201cAs we have very little data about anything other than northern European ancestral genetic variation, we urgently need to find out more about other ancestries.\u201d Much of the available genome data at presently available comes from the government-backed 100,000 Genomes Project, which has sequenced genomes from NHS patients affected by rare diseases or cancer, making the results available to approved researchers. More controversially, private companies have taken advantage of the cheapness of sequencing, offering simple kits direct to consumers. A recent arrival is Sano, a startup in Cambridge Science Park. Unlike some more established names, such as 23andme, which offer general sequencing reports, Sano seeks to act as a matchmaker between people with particular conditions (or a genetic predisposition to them) and researchers in related fields. Its chief executive, Patrick Short, 28, is from North Carolina. He did his doctorate in mathematical genomics and medicine at Cambridge University and set up Sano three years ago with two fellow PhD students. He says there are three main phases in the advancement of personalised medicine. First, improved diagnosis, then improved treatment as a result of better diagnosis. And the third stage, he says, will be much earlier detection and prevention. \u201cThis is one of the great promises of genetic medicine,\u201d Short says. \u201cBecause our DNA does not change through our lives, our DNA \u2013 along with information about our environment and behaviour \u2013 should be a powerful tool for moving towards proactive rather than reactive healthcare.\u201d But, because our DNA is key to who we are, thatandwith our genome our private code, there is a lot of sensitivity about the protection of genetic information. Developments in the field have given rise to several ethical issues. In terms of identification, in America there have been cases of DNA samples being traced, via close matches on genomics websites, to relations of a suspect in a crime, and this has led to arrests. It\u2019s just one of the more dramatic ways that our genetic data, once in the public realm, can affect not just ourselves but others. Looking to the future, there are concerns that health insurers and employers may demand or get access to personal genetic data. Even today there are fears that DNA information is being traded without the knowledge or informed consent of the consumer (as often consent is buried deep within long-winded agreement forms). However, Jeffrey Skopek, a lecturer in medical law and ethics at the University of Cambridge, questions the belief that all things genetic require greater protection than other information \u2013 a belief he terms \u201cgenetic exceptionalism\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of information about ourselves that is health-related, from which health inferences can be drawn, which we expose to the world and our employers all the time,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt could be the case, for example, that algorithms looking at your Facebook likes will be able to predict health outcomes.\u201d Sano, which offers personalised reports based on genome sequencing, prides itself on leaving consumers in charge of their data, so nothing is passed on for research purposes, even anonymously, without signed agreement. Short says: \u201cWe built our platform specifically to allow participants to have full control over data use.\u201d The default setting on Sano\u2019s website is to ask for consent each time the consumer supplies new information, to avoid the danger of anyone accidentally making their data open-access. Short believes consumers have been misled by many genetic testing companies, which, he says, \u201coften sacrifice scientific integrity to sell kits\u201d. There have been cases of false positives, where consumers were led to believe they were predisposed to a condition, and false negatives where the consumer was wrongly given an all clear. Such mistakes have occurred partly because most sequencing tests analyse a tiny fraction of DNA, and thus may pick up some mutations without noticing others. Also interpretation of genetic information is complex and requires a sophisticated understanding of a person\u2019s genome and environment. In the US, 23andMe had its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval withdrawn for a couple of years, following concern about inaccurate results. It was reinstated after the company took steps to meet FDA regulations. Now the firm focuses on a selection of conditions for which there are known genetic markers, such as type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and coeliac disease, and emphasises that these markers only influence your chances of developing a condition. In July, Dante Labs launched a consumer genetic testing service. A \u201csuper premium, whole genome\u201d sequencing teston samples sent to its lab in L\u2019Aquila, near Rome, currently costs \u20ac599 (\u00a3500). For this sum users receive a \u201cfull check-up for all common and rare diseases\u201d. Sano, Dante, 23andMe and other testing companies allow users to download their raw data. They can upload this to a third party site such as Genomapp for further interpretation. In the case of Genomapp you will be informed via its app about your risk of developing some 300 conditions and diseases. So while the testing companies may try to ensure they deliver information to their customers in a responsible way, there is nothing to stop users shopping their data around for further analysis. As Skopek notes: \u201cThere\u2019s a certain set of concerns that arise when the physician is out of the equation.\u201d Sano aims to provide a next-generation sequencing service, with genetic counsellors available, a doctor involved and good links to the NHS. But that is only an aim, and not a plan Short expects to see realised for at least a year. Given the time it takes to form working relationships, even a year may be highly optimistic. In the meantime, says Short, Sano is offering three types of testing kit. Its Genotyping kit, costing \u00a3125, analyses less than 0.02% of a person\u2019s DNA. Exome Plus measures up to 2% of your DNA and costs \u00a3450. For \u00a3950 you can get all your DNA measured with the Whole Genome option. \u201cThe majority of our research projects are connecting people who already have a condition diagnosed,\u201d says Short. So people with psoriatic arthritis can, as Short puts it, \u201ccontribute to research and learn more about how genetics might affect severity\u201d. There\u2019s a similar study up and running for people with stomach ulcers. But what of people without a known condition? If none of the kits provide diagnosis at the moment, what is it that they do offer? Well, you can learn about how such traits as odour detection, circadian rhythms, coffee consumption, nicotine dependence and male pattern baldness are influenced by your genes. It\u2019s intriguing stuff but not perhaps the kind of analysis that will encourage many people to tick the \u00a3950 box. The main body of Sano\u2019s work is matchmaking, putting together those with rare diseases and the researchers looking into them. One project the company is involved with is working with a patient support group for those with Phelan McDermid syndrome, a neurodevelopment disorder caused by a mutation of the Shank3 gene. Children born with the disorder suffer from poor head control and low muscle tone, and typically exhibit developmental and speech delays. The company has analysed the DNA of a number of families with the disorder in what Short described as a \u201cgrassroots, patient-led\u201d initiative. These are promising signs, pointing to a new, patient-empowered future. But in terms of personalised or precision medicine, it\u2019s all rather vague and hopeful. That, however, is where the science of genome sequencing mostly is right now \u2013 vague and hopeful. It promises a great deal and, in time, will probably deliver on many of those promises. As Wright says: \u201cFor some people genome sequencing is very predictive and hugely useful. For most people, at this point in time, it is neither.\u201d But the greater the number of genomes sequenced, the more that balance will shift.

It is more than 300 days since either bill was discussed in parliament, although the bills are seen as essential in providing continuity after Brexit, with a deal or without.</p> <p>Shaun Spiers of the Green Alliance said: \u201cIf these issues do not get serious consideration from Defra, it will be extremely disruptive. There has been a hiatus, with very little activity on environmental issues, and a huge risk that we do not have an environmental vision for the UK as we face an ecological crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The focus on the welfare of domestic pets risked ignoring the bigger picture of a UK wildlife crisis, campaigners said, by going for a \u201ccutewash\u201d angle of microchipped cats while wildlife populations from bees and butterflies to voles, birds and hedgehogs continued to plummet.</p> <p>The funding devoted to wildlife and nature conservation in the UK was also falling, said Martin Harper of the RSPB. \u201cWe are still waiting for an appropriately resourced plan to turn round the biodiversity loss we have seen. We need to see a plan and we have not seen one yet.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, the government announced \u201can ambitious net zero package\u201d on the climate emergency, which will comprise funding of up to \u00a31bn in the automotive industry to reduce emissions, \u00a3220m for a nuclear fusion reactor and a \u201cfuture homes standard\u201d on energy efficiency, to be introduced from 2025.</p> <p>However, green groups questioned whether the measures would be effective. Craig Bennett of Friends of the Earth said chasing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/nuclear-fusion-energy-research\">nuclear fusion technology</a>, which has been under development for decades without exploitable results, was \u201cthrowing money away in Never Never Land\u201d while neglecting onshore wind and solar power.</p> <p>\u201cA future homes standard in 2025 doesn\u2019t do anything for the people living in cold, draughty homes now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could and should have been doing this already [but] the government scrapped the zero carbon homes standard in 2015. We need to be investing in insulation and energy efficiency today.\u201d</p> <p>Spiers said: \u201cAll green news is good news and these measures are welcome. But the UK is some way off target to achieve net zero by 2050 and they will not be enough to get us on track. At their conference, Labour and the Lib Dems agreed ambitious decarbonisation plans. The European commission is planning a green new deal. Now it is the Conservatives\u2019 chance to show how serious they are about tackling the climate emergency.\u201d</p> <p>The Tory leadership will face difficult questions at conference from many of its core voters, as farmers and rural constituencies, which are overwhelmingly Conservative in most of England, are facing the prospect of a no-deal Brexit disaster.</p> <p>Tim Breitmeyer, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, told the Guardian that people were losing faith in the Tory party as a result and considering the Liberal Democrats as an alternative. \u201cThere are an awful lot of people who are really questioning whether next time round that [Tory] is the way they are going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be quite a lot of people who look to see whether the Liberal Democrats [have better policies].\u201d</p> <p>He said as much as a quarter of rural businesses could go bust from the impact of a no-deal Brexit and called on the government to set out how it would help farmers and other rural business owners to cope.</p> <p>The National Farmers\u2019 Union is also concerned about the potentially devastating impact of Brexit on farmers and has written to Villiers with five demands, including: an impact assessment, a new trade and standards commission to ensure UK standards are not undermined by future trade deals, and details on how the government plans to reward farmers for looking after the environment.</p> <p>The government\u2019s past record on green issues has been mixed, say campaigners. While they welcome achievements such as the net zero carbon target and the 25-year environment plan, most want to see more detail and strong funding commitments. There are also broad concerns about environmental protections being sacrificed in any future deals after Brexit. The Green Alliance said the UK\u2019s environmental protections had been at risk since the referendum, in part because of a lack of certainty over future legislation and indications that the government would consider rolling back existing protections as part of future trade deals.</p>",

But we also need to see government action on the other, far bigger threats many animal species including ourselves are facing, such as the climate emergency, rampant deforestation, plastic waste and air pollution.\u201d He cited the need to clean up polluted city air, tackle the scourge of plastic waste, strengthen environmental standards, and preparing Britain for the effects of climate change, as priorities the government must address urgently. Campaigners are also still frustrated by a lack of detailed policy on how the UK will meet its net zero carbon target. The Labour party has set up a consultation, to report in December, on key policies that will be needed, and set out the first parts of a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d at its party conference, where the climate was the biggest theme alongside Brexit. With the prorogation of parliament, the environment bill and the agriculture bill set out under Michael Gove were left adrift. It is more than 300 days since either bill was discussed in parliament, although the bills are seen as essential in providing continuity after Brexit, with a deal or without. Shaun Spiers of the Green Alliance said: \u201cIf these issues do not get serious consideration from Defra, it will be extremely disruptive. There has been a hiatus, with very little activity on environmental issues, and a huge risk that we do not have an environmental vision for the UK as we face an ecological crisis.\u201d The focus on the welfare of domestic pets risked ignoring the bigger picture of a UK wildlife crisis, campaigners said, by going for a \u201ccutewash\u201d angle of microchipped cats while wildlife populations from bees and butterflies to voles, birds and hedgehogs continued to plummet. The funding devoted to wildlife and nature conservation in the UK was also falling, said Martin Harper of the RSPB. \u201cWe are still waiting for an appropriately resourced plan to turn round the biodiversity loss we have seen. We need to see a plan and we have not seen one yet.\u201d Separately, the government announced \u201can ambitious net zero package\u201d on the climate emergency, which will comprise funding of up to \u00a31bn in the automotive industry to reduce emissions, \u00a3220m for a nuclear fusion reactor and a \u201cfuture homes standard\u201d on energy efficiency, to be introduced from 2025. However, green groups questioned whether the measures would be effective. Craig Bennett of Friends of the Earth said chasing nuclear fusion technology, which has been under development for decades without exploitable results, was \u201cthrowing money away in Never Never Land\u201d while neglecting onshore wind and solar power. \u201cA future homes standard in 2025 doesn\u2019t do anything for the people living in cold, draughty homes now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could and should have been doing this already [but] the government scrapped the zero carbon homes standard in 2015. We need to be investing in insulation and energy efficiency today.\u201d Spiers said: \u201cAll green news is good news and these measures are welcome. But the UK is some way off target to achieve net zero by 2050 and they will not be enough to get us on track. At their conference, Labour and the Lib Dems agreed ambitious decarbonisation plans. The European commission is planning a green new deal. Now it is the Conservatives\u2019 chance to show how serious they are about tackling the climate emergency.\u201d The Tory leadership will face difficult questions at conference from many of its core voters, as farmers and rural constituencies, which are overwhelmingly Conservative in most of England, are facing the prospect of a no-deal Brexit disaster. Tim Breitmeyer, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, told the Guardian that people were losing faith in the Tory party as a result and considering the Liberal Democrats as an alternative. \u201cThere are an awful lot of people who are really questioning whether next time round that [Tory] is the way they are going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be quite a lot of people who look to see whether the Liberal Democrats [have better policies].\u201d He said as much as a quarter of rural businesses could go bust from the impact of a no-deal Brexit and called on the government to set out how it would help farmers and other rural business owners to cope. The National Farmers\u2019 Union is also concerned about the potentially devastating impact of Brexit on farmers and has written to Villiers with five demands, including: an impact assessment, a new trade and standards commission to ensure UK standards are not undermined by future trade deals, and details on how the government plans to reward farmers for looking after the environment. The government\u2019s past record on green issues has been mixed, say campaigners. While they welcome achievements such as the net zero carbon target and the 25-year environment plan, most want to see more detail and strong funding commitments. There are also broad concerns about environmental protections being sacrificed in any future deals after Brexit. The Green Alliance said the UK\u2019s environmental protections had been at risk since the referendum, in part because of a lack of certainty over future legislation and indications that the government would consider rolling back existing protections as part of future trade deals.",

      "body": "<p>Before any mountaineers leave Everest base camp to climb to the summit, a Buddhist priest arrives to conduct the <em>puja</em> ceremony, praying for a safe expedition. The <em>lama</em> pays homage to the mountain deity, spreads tsampa flour on the faces of the climbers and sherpas, and throws the rest in the air for good luck. The climbers lay their boots and crampons, some beer and some Marmite on a stone altar of prayer flags at 5,364 metres. Another 3,484 metres above them is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/everest\" title=\"\">highest point on th</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/everest\" title=\"\">e planet</a>.</p> <p>Mountains have always been sacred places \u2013 the summits are where heaven meets Earth and the gods meet humanity. Tradition states that if you are foolish enough to heed the call of the sage, the priest, the poet, this is where you begin. Four nights up on a summit and you return either mad or as a poet. <a href=\"https://www.grahamhoyland.com/\" title=\"\">Graham Hoyland</a>, who has successfully climbed Everest twice, told me that on both occasions he came down a different man from the one who went up; the endeavour changed him.</p> <p>But can we have this life-changing experience without travelling to the Himalayas, without all the oxygen cylinders \u2013 and all the expense? To find out, I decided to walk the height of Mount Everest in England \u2013 8,848 metres (29,029 feet) by climbing a succession of England\u2019s hills and mountains, from Cornwall to Cumbria. It had been the toughest two years of my life and what was needed was some space between the past and the future. This was to be as much a spiritual journey as a physical challenge. The big hills and mountains are predominantly on the west side of England so the route pretty much drew itself, and although I drove the longer distances between hills, I used public footpaths to make the climbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a63fdd956c22fc4096f8a12465a6a7a285240377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63fdd956c22fc4096f8a12465a6a7a285240377/0_44_1300_832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brea Hill, adjacent to the Camel estuary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brea Hill, adjacent to the Camel estuary, the start of the writer\u2019s odyssey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Husband/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I bought maps, made plans and booked the cheapest B&amp;Bs I could find \u2013 something told me that I should not stay with friends; that this journey was to be made alone, with no television, no radio, no weather forecasts. I agreed to take a mobile phone only after a dressing-down from my youngest daughter, but on the understanding that it would remain switched off unless there was an emergency.</p> <p>I set out in late April, with the aim of walking for 12 days, starting in the south-west of England on <a href=\"https://www.themountainguide.co.uk/england/brea-hill.htm\" title=\"\">Brea Hill</a>, a bump on the northern side of the Camel estuary in Cornwall. From there it was on to Bodmin Moor, then Yes Tor on Dartmoor, heading north as the hills increase in height, and finally on to Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England. (I spent a lot of time poring over the question of achieving the height of Everest, and the hills I walked were just under, by five metres, so I climbed one of the pine trees in the graveyard underneath Scafell Pike to make the summit.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"521cc74367fea1d1d9b360cee832f8df0de0a08c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521cc74367fea1d1d9b360cee832f8df0de0a08c/0_32_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bronn Wennili, the highest point on Bodmin Moor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bronn Wennili, the highest point on Bodmin Moor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Chapman/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I pulled the car up under Brea Hill, the sun was tinting the clouds lemon yellow and the door to <a href=\"http://www.greatenglishchurches.co.uk/html/st_enodoc.html\" title=\"\">S</a><a href=\"http://www.greatenglishchurches.co.uk/html/st_enodoc.html\" title=\"\">t Enodoc church</a>, sitting at the edge of the dunes, was invitingly open. It seemed like a sign, so rather than waiting to set off the next day, I started my journey there and then. From that point onwards, the months of planning and all the timings were completely skewed \u2013 and it was the best decision I made.</p> <p>From Brea Hill the journey wound on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/13/brown-willy-cornwalls-highest-point-up-for-sale-at-28m\" title=\"\">Bronn Wennili</a>, the \u201cHill of Swallows\u201d, on Bodmin Moor, the highest point in Cornwall at 420 metres. The summit appeared almost like an island in a thick haze of mist. At <a href=\"https://www.visitdartmoor.co.uk/things-to-do/yes-tor-and-high-willhays-dartmoor-high-walks-p1964373\" title=\"\">Yes Tor and High Willhays</a>, on the summit of Dartmoor, it was almost too windy to stand, and it came as a relief to scramble down to the shelter offered by the fabulous <a href=\"https://www.visitdartmoor.co.uk/things-to-do/black-a-tor-copse-p202813\" title=\"\">Black a Tor copse</a>, twisted with stunted oaks steeped in luminous moss.</p> <p>The wind on Dartmoor was bearing a storm that roared over <a href=\"https://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/walksdb/259/\" title=\"\">Great Hangman on Exmoor</a> the next day, flattening the heather and snugging ewes and their lambs into scrapes and walls. The sea beneath the cliffs was almost white with crashing waves, apart from one red tanker swaying alone. Storms shake the template.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"028e2b54c5bd2a06e9db1e50a150cffe02fa291a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/028e2b54c5bd2a06e9db1e50a150cffe02fa291a/0_354_3931_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malvern Ridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malvern Ridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas E Jones/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Australian Aboriginal people describe a certain point in any journey as being \u201cthree days deep\u201d. By this they mean that it takes three days alone in the natural world to reach a change in consciousness. After three days, you enter The Dreamtime. Although I made it a rule to greet everyone I passed, there wasn\u2019t any conversation, and in the absence of radio, television and newspapers, the world quietened and the familiar found new forms. Up on the <a href=\"https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=17028\" title=\"\">Malvern Ridge</a>, I became aware that it was increasingly a journey into silence, and around each corner was the new lace of spring that I would have otherwise simply walked past.</p> <p>Most of us on this island live on \u201cthe plain\u201d \u2013 a busy place of people, traffic, sirens, machines, televisions, mobile phones \u2013 and we get used to the noise. But once you are above 200 metres or so, the soundscape quietens, and all those hardwired patterns of thought start to loosen their grip. What had started as an extended route march marked by time and distance began to fall away, or maybe I just began to let it all go. And by the time I arrived in the Shropshire Hills, it was in the midst of a heatwave, warm air blanketing a thousand different shades of green shoots and leaves, and lines of early buttercups bubbling up at the side of the paths. Even the rooks, normally brash in spring, were lulled into becoming languorous sentries. I spent the entire day smiling.</p> <p>Travelling further north, more of the hills become mountains. In the UK, any peak above 2,000 feet (610m metres) is classified as a mountain, and there are over 200 mountains in England. These are precious places, because they remain relatively untamed and beyond the savagery of intensive farming. You walk up off the plain, out of the fields around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/mar/04/edale-peak-district-national-park\" title=\"\">Edale</a> in the Peak District, and follow a stream into a world of heather, white thistles and black peat, ravens, red grouse and <a href=\"https://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?species=semele\" title=\"\">grayling butterflies</a>. Halfway up <a href=\"https://www.ukscrambles.com/peak-district-scrambles/grindsbrook-clough/\" title=\"\">Grindsbrook Clough</a>, a steep boulder climb, the mist came in, burying the ground and leaching confidence out of just about every walker. I ended up sitting down with a group of elderly hikers, none of us really knowing where we were or how to find the summit of <a href=\"https://www.visitpeakdistrict.com/things-to-do/kinder-scout-p689971\" title=\"\">Kinder Scout</a>. It was comforting not to be lost alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19677ca69ed5635e91aa3c585a6d020036f60aaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19677ca69ed5635e91aa3c585a6d020036f60aaa/0_48_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cheviot seen from near the summit of Wideopen Hill in the Scottish Borders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cheviot seen from near the summit of Wideopen Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Taylor/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final two days were big days. <a href=\"https://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/places-to-visit/the-cheviots/the-cheviot/\" title=\"\">The Cheviot in Northumberland</a> had patches of snow scattered across the slopes and there were the remains of a wild Arctic light breaking through the clouds. It\u2019s almost a yellow brick road to the summit \u2013 paving slabs leading over mire to a desolate trig point, a place where barely anything grows. Really, these are deserts. You walk up into a desert.</p> <p>The final evening was spent at the fabulous <a href=\"http://wasdale.com/\" title=\"\">Wasdale Head Inn</a>, at the foot of Scafell Pike and Great Gable, the birthplace of British rock climbing. By then I had reached a point where I didn\u2019t want to speak to anyone. After 11 days I had fallen into a sweet solitude, an inner silence, almost a rest from the constant state of working things out, of planning, of reckoning. In the morning, the cloud base was down, shrouding the land above 300 metres. Here, there are no dry-stone walls to rein in the land, and the streams are as yet unnamed. You walk into the mist, into a land of cairns and snow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82cceb1370b5ca183233bb5d7c266ee3562074f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82cceb1370b5ca183233bb5d7c266ee3562074f7/0_88_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walker approaching the summit of Scafell Pike - the highest mountain in England,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Approaching the summit of Scafell Pike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Oakey/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hills and mountains of England hold so much more than history, than scenery.

      "bodyText": "Before any mountaineers leave Everest base camp to climb to the summit, a Buddhist priest arrives to conduct the puja ceremony, praying for a safe expedition. The lama pays homage to the mountain deity, spreads tsampa flour on the faces of the climbers and sherpas, and throws the rest in the air for good luck. The climbers lay their boots and crampons, some beer and some Marmite on a stone altar of prayer flags at 5,364 metres. Another 3,484 metres above them is the highest point on the planet. Mountains have always been sacred places \u2013 the summits are where heaven meets Earth and the gods meet humanity. Tradition states that if you are foolish enough to heed the call of the sage, the priest, the poet, this is where you begin. Four nights up on a summit and you return either mad or as a poet. Graham Hoyland, who has successfully climbed Everest twice, told me that on both occasions he came down a different man from the one who went up; the endeavour changed him. But can we have this life-changing experience without travelling to the Himalayas, without all the oxygen cylinders \u2013 and all the expense? To find out, I decided to walk the height of Mount Everest in England \u2013 8,848 metres (29,029 feet) by climbing a succession of England\u2019s hills and mountains, from Cornwall to Cumbria. It had been the toughest two years of my life and what was needed was some space between the past and the future. This was to be as much a spiritual journey as a physical challenge. The big hills and mountains are predominantly on the west side of England so the route pretty much drew itself, and although I drove the longer distances between hills, I used public footpaths to make the climbs. I bought maps, made plans and booked the cheapest B&amp;Bs I could find \u2013 something told me that I should not stay with friends; that this journey was to be made alone, with no television, no radio, no weather forecasts. I agreed to take a mobile phone only after a dressing-down from my youngest daughter, but on the understanding that it would remain switched off unless there was an emergency. I set out in late April, with the aim of walking for 12 days, starting in the south-west of England on Brea Hill, a bump on the northern side of the Camel estuary in Cornwall. From there it was on to Bodmin Moor, then Yes Tor on Dartmoor, heading north as the hills increase in height, and finally on to Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England. (I spent a lot of time poring over the question of achieving the height of Everest, and the hills I walked were just under, by five metres, so I climbed one of the pine trees in the graveyard underneath Scafell Pike to make the summit.) As I pulled the car up under Brea Hill, the sun was tinting the clouds lemon yellow and the door to St Enodoc church, sitting at the edge of the dunes, was invitingly open. It seemed like a sign, so rather than waiting to set off the next day, I started my journey there and then. From that point onwards, the months of planning and all the timings were completely skewed \u2013 and it was the best decision I made. From Brea Hill the journey wound on to Bronn Wennili, the \u201cHill of Swallows\u201d, on Bodmin Moor, the highest point in Cornwall at 420 metres. The summit appeared almost like an island in a thick haze of mist. At Yes Tor and High Willhays, on the summit of Dartmoor, it was almost too windy to stand, and it came as a relief to scramble down to the shelter offered by the fabulous Black a Tor copse, twisted with stunted oaks steeped in luminous moss. The wind on Dartmoor was bearing a storm that roared over Great Hangman on Exmoor the next day, flattening the heather and snugging ewes and their lambs into scrapes and walls. The sea beneath the cliffs was almost white with crashing waves, apart from one red tanker swaying alone. Storms shake the template. Australian Aboriginal people describe a certain point in any journey as being \u201cthree days deep\u201d. By this they mean that it takes three days alone in the natural world to reach a change in consciousness. After three days, you enter The Dreamtime. Although I made it a rule to greet everyone I passed, there wasn\u2019t any conversation, and in the absence of radio, television and newspapers, the world quietened and the familiar found new forms. Up on the Malvern Ridge, I became aware that it was increasingly a journey into silence, and around each corner was the new lace of spring that I would have otherwise simply walked past. Most of us on this island live on \u201cthe plain\u201d \u2013 a busy place of people, traffic, sirens, machines, televisions, mobile phones \u2013 and we get used to the noise. But once you are above 200 metres or so, the soundscape quietens, and all those hardwired patterns of thought start to loosen their grip. What had started as an extended route march marked by time and distance began to fall away, or maybe I just began to let it all go. And by the time I arrived in the Shropshire Hills, it was in the midst of a heatwave, warm air blanketing a thousand different shades of green shoots and leaves, and lines of early buttercups bubbling up at the side of the paths. Even the rooks, normally brash in spring, were lulled into becoming languorous sentries. I spent the entire day smiling. Travelling further north, more of the hills become mountains. In the UK, any peak above 2,000 feet (610m metres) is classified as a mountain, and there are over 200 mountains in England. These are precious places, because they remain relatively untamed and beyond the savagery of intensive farming. You walk up off the plain, out of the fields around Edale in the Peak District, and follow a stream into a world of heather, white thistles and black peat, ravens, red grouse and grayling butterflies. Halfway up Grindsbrook Clough, a steep boulder climb, the mist came in, burying the ground and leaching confidence out of just about every walker. I ended up sitting down with a group of elderly hikers, none of us really knowing where we were or how to find the summit of Kinder Scout. It was comforting not to be lost alone. The final two days were big days. The Cheviot in Northumberland had patches of snow scattered across the slopes and there were the remains of a wild Arctic light breaking through the clouds. It\u2019s almost a yellow brick road to the summit \u2013 paving slabs leading over mire to a desolate trig point, a place where barely anything grows. Really, these are deserts. You walk up into a desert. The final evening was spent at the fabulous Wasdale Head Inn, at the foot of Scafell Pike and Great Gable, the birthplace of British rock climbing. By then I had reached a point where I didn\u2019t want to speak to anyone. After 11 days I had fallen into a sweet solitude, an inner silence, almost a rest from the constant state of working things out, of planning, of reckoning. In the morning, the cloud base was down, shrouding the land above 300 metres. Here, there are no dry-stone walls to rein in the land, and the streams are as yet unnamed. You walk into the mist, into a land of cairns and snow. The hills and mountains of England hold so much more than history, than scenery. They remain sanctuaries, places of real healing. They might not be as flowered as the Alps, as high as the Himalayas, but their gift is that we can leave in the morning, walk up off the plain and on to the summit and be back down by evening. We can walk into another world, another England.

      "bodyText": "Lily Cole has backed calls for UK banks to \u201cradically transform\u201d and take the climate emergency much more seriously. The actor, model and activist is the latest high-profile name to emerge as a customer of the ethical bank Triodos, which has a current account which can be managed online and via a mobile app. Other famous customers include the actors James Norton and Sir Mark Rylance. Cole says: \u201cI\u2019ve long believed in voting with your wallet for the change you want to see in the world \u2013 for example, supporting Fairtrade and organic food and fashion. Yet there are other subtle and powerful ways that our money shapes the world, such as the investments made by our banks, pensions and the institutions we work with.\u201d She says as soon as Triodos offered a current account in the UK, \u201cI immediately joined the bank, as I didn\u2019t want to be accidentally investing in the arms trade and fossil fuel industry\u201d. Triodos says that according to the organisation BankTrack, the top UK banks have poured nearly \u00a3150bn into financing fossil fuels since the Paris agreement on climate change was adopted in late 2016. It says banks should be using the money deposited with them in their customers\u2019 long-term interests. \u201cWe want more people to know that switching banks is one of the most powerful environmental changes you can make as an individual\u2026 You can choose to prevent your money from financing arms, pesticides, plastic packaging or fossil fuels.\u201d Triodos\u2019s current account comes with an eco-friendly contactless debit Mastercard overdraft of up to \u00a32,000 is available, but there is a \u00a33 monthly account fee.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/22/thomas-cook-in-last-ditch-talks-to-avoid-collapse\">In the early hours of Monday morning, with most of its fleet of planes on the ground, the rug was pulled from under Thomas Cook</a>, in the biggest failure of a travel firm in British history. Tens of thousands of holidaymakers have been airlifted home, many after exhausting queues in airports, and with a million more are seeking refunds on future bookings. So what does the debacle tell us about protecting ourselves when making bookings in future?</p> \n<h2><strong>Atol (mostly) works \u2013 and is worth having</strong></h2> \n<p>If you\u2019ve just spent 24 hours at Dalaman airport waiting to board a rescheduled flight home, or you were forced out of your hotel by irate owners, you might disagree. But the Atol (Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence) scheme has mostly come to the aid of up to 600,000 holidaymakers who had Thomas Cook bookings for future trips, or were already abroad. Set up in 1973 after several high profile travel firms collapsed leaving people stranded in Spain, a \u00a32.50 Atol levy is applied to each holiday booking.</p> \n<p>As the name suggests Atol covers flight-based trips, and also most cruise packages. It has been extended to those booking flights and hotels together with the likes of Expedia and Lastminute.com. So a weekend away in Rome can be covered in the same way as a package holiday to Turkey but only if you book both from the same travel firm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5c304d94-202d-42a4-bc1b-a6569a95dc54\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Brexit</b><br>\u201cThere is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Weather</b><br>The summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nilspratley\"><b>Nils Pratley</b></a>, financial editor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>You need to make sure your trip will actually be covered</strong></h2> \n<p>Thomas Cook won\u2019t be the last travel firm to fail, so check your travel agent/website is Atol registered before handing over card details \u2013 and be aware Atol is only offered by UK based travel firms.</p> \n<p>Beware how many foreign travel websites will give the impression they are based in the UK when they are not. Firms have to publish their Atol number \u2013 and if you unsure you can check its validity on <a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/ATOL-protection/Check-an-ATOL/ATOL-holder-search/\" title=\"\">the C</a><a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/ATOL-protection/Check-an-ATOL/ATOL-holder-search/\" title=\"\">ivil Aviation Authority website.</a> When you make an Atol protected booking you will receive an Atol certificate which lists which parts of the trip that are financially protected. If you don\u2019t get a certificate, you don\u2019t have the protection. For that weekend in Rome, check what you are booking is Atol covered, as the way in which it is booked is crucial as to whether you have cover or not. You have similar but different cover if your package starts with a train or coach trip. It\u2019s the same for UK cruises.</p> \n<p>While Atol was designed to cover flight-based trips, the Package Travel regulations apply to all other holiday travel packages booked if they are booked through Abta-registered travel agents/websites. If you book a rail or coach trip, or a cruise that starts in the UK and includes hotel accommodation thrown in, it is the Abta agent scheme that will refund you if the travel firm collapses, or get you home if required. It\u2019s the same story if your cruise starts at a UK port. Some Thomas Cook customers who had used its travel agents to book trips with other tour operators will have had their bookings honoured because they were covered by Abta, Abta told us this week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"983b096998e2744cec54ecef90b244660f7f5376\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/983b096998e2744cec54ecef90b244660f7f5376/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers wait to board a Ryanair flight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryanair flights booked using its website do not carry Atol protection.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>It\u2019s different if you book your own flights and hotels separately</strong></h2> \n<p>If you book a flight using the Ryanair, or rival carrier\u2019s website, and a hotel, or villa on Booking.com or Airbnb \u2013 there is no Atol protection. As a result the advice is always to pay using a credit rather than debit card because it allows you to hold the card company liable in the event the airline folds before you travel, provided the ticket cost more than \u00a3100.</p> \n<p>While it is unlikely Ryanair will collapse, it is only a matter of time before another airline folds. There were plenty of people who booked flight-only deals with Thomas Cook who are now making section 75 claims to their card providers.</p> \n<p>For bookings costing less than \u00a3100, or if you paid by debit card, you may be able to claim money back from your card provider through the chargeback scheme. The chargeback process isn\u2019t a legal requirement, but has become an industry standard. Some Thomas Cook customers have had flight-only charges refunded via chargebacks.</p> \n<p>You may buy a flight from Ryanair and later add a hotel on its much-promoted Ryanair Rooms site, but that does not automatically constitute a package deal. Basically to benefit from EU \u201clinked travel arrangement\u201d protection you must purchase both flight and hotel from the same company within the same 24 hours.

      "bodyText": "In the early hours of Monday morning, with most of its fleet of planes on the ground, the rug was pulled from under Thomas Cook, in the biggest failure of a travel firm in British history. Tens of thousands of holidaymakers have been airlifted home, many after exhausting queues in airports, and with a million more are seeking refunds on future bookings. So what does the debacle tell us about protecting ourselves when making bookings in future? Atol (mostly) works \u2013 and is worth having If you\u2019ve just spent 24 hours at Dalaman airport waiting to board a rescheduled flight home, or you were forced out of your hotel by irate owners, you might disagree. But the Atol (Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence) scheme has mostly come to the aid of up to 600,000 holidaymakers who had Thomas Cook bookings for future trips, or were already abroad. Set up in 1973 after several high profile travel firms collapsed leaving people stranded in Spain, a \u00a32.50 Atol levy is applied to each holiday booking. As the name suggests Atol covers flight-based trips, and also most cruise packages. It has been extended to those booking flights and hotels together with the likes of Expedia and Lastminute.com. So a weekend away in Rome can be covered in the same way as a package holiday to Turkey but only if you book both from the same travel firm. You need to make sure your trip will actually be covered Thomas Cook won\u2019t be the last travel firm to fail, so check your travel agent/website is Atol registered before handing over card details \u2013 and be aware Atol is only offered by UK based travel firms. Beware how many foreign travel websites will give the impression they are based in the UK when they are not. Firms have to publish their Atol number \u2013 and if you unsure you can check its validity on the Civil Aviation Authority website. When you make an Atol protected booking you will receive an Atol certificate which lists which parts of the trip that are financially protected. If you don\u2019t get a certificate, you don\u2019t have the protection. For that weekend in Rome, check what you are booking is Atol covered, as the way in which it is booked is crucial as to whether you have cover or not. You have similar but different cover if your package starts with a train or coach trip. It\u2019s the same for UK cruises. While Atol was designed to cover flight-based trips, the Package Travel regulations apply to all other holiday travel packages booked if they are booked through Abta-registered travel agents/websites. If you book a rail or coach trip, or a cruise that starts in the UK and includes hotel accommodation thrown in, it is the Abta agent scheme that will refund you if the travel firm collapses, or get you home if required. It\u2019s the same story if your cruise starts at a UK port. Some Thomas Cook customers who had used its travel agents to book trips with other tour operators will have had their bookings honoured because they were covered by Abta, Abta told us this week. It\u2019s different if you book your own flights and hotels separately If you book a flight using the Ryanair, or rival carrier\u2019s website, and a hotel, or villa on Booking.com or Airbnb \u2013 there is no Atol protection. As a result the advice is always to pay using a credit rather than debit card because it allows you to hold the card company liable in the event the airline folds before you travel, provided the ticket cost more than \u00a3100. While it is unlikely Ryanair will collapse, it is only a matter of time before another airline folds. There were plenty of people who booked flight-only deals with Thomas Cook who are now making section 75 claims to their card providers. For bookings costing less than \u00a3100, or if you paid by debit card, you may be able to claim money back from your card provider through the chargeback scheme. The chargeback process isn\u2019t a legal requirement, but has become an industry standard. Some Thomas Cook customers have had flight-only charges refunded via chargebacks. You may buy a flight from Ryanair and later add a hotel on its much-promoted Ryanair Rooms site, but that does not automatically constitute a package deal. Basically to benefit from EU \u201clinked travel arrangement\u201d protection you must purchase both flight and hotel from the same company within the same 24 hours. Ryanair told us its passengers are protected under the Irish package travel directive, which is equivalent to Atol. On lastminute.com if you buy flight and hotel in one go, paid together, you get Atol protection. In truth, the rules are a mess for consumers to navigate, through.

Superhero movies traditionally reassure us that good ultimately triumphs over evil, but Joker heads in the opposite direction. Fleck starts out as a decent but troubled soul. An aspiring standup comedian, he believes his mission is to bring laughter to the world, until life disabuses him of that notion. (Career advice: if you\u2019re a clown entertaining a children\u2019s hospital ward, don\u2019t bring your gun to work.) Snip away the references to Gotham City and the Wayne family, and Joker is barely a comic-book movie at all, more a grim character study of snowballing defeat and humiliation, with no silver lining or caped crusader on the horizon.

But as critic <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-1202170236/\">David Ehrlich wrote in his Joker review</a>: \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental difference between telling a story like this in the form of a dingy, misanthropic art film like Taxi Driver and telling it in the universal language of a superhero movie that\u2019s going to open in multiplexes the world over. In this context, that story can\u2019t help but feel aspirational.\u201d</p> <p>As much as \u201cdoing something Marvel can\u2019t do\u201d, the suggestion is that Joker does something superhero movies <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> do. Perhaps the concern is down to the nature of the Joker himself. It is hard to imagine this kind of story being made with any other comic-book character. The Joker is easily the most recognisable and popular villain in the game, and the most complex. And the most entertaining.</p> <p>\u201cEvery generation gets its own Joker,\u201d says professor Ben Saunders, founder of the comic-book studies minor at the University of Oregon, who has written extensively on superheroes. \u201cEvery decade of the past 80 years has had its own version.\u201d He suggests the character\u2019s evolution is the result of a \u201ccomplex, transmedia feedback loop\u201d between the Joker\u2019s various media portrayals, in comics, TV, animation, film and even video games. \u201cThe Joker is actually a series of Jokers \u2013 and talented creators are free to play with different elements in producing any new version.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/16/mark-hamill-jack-nicholson-heath-ledger-joker-batman-best\">Over his many screen portrayals</a>, the Joker character has been on a steady journey from two-dimensions into three. Cesar Romero\u2019s version in the 1960s Batman TV series captured the character\u2019s trickster sensibility, but he was arguably no deeper than a playing card, reflecting both the tone of the Batman comic books at the time and the half-hour children\u2019s show format, which was all screen superheroes then merited.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43786c4bef8bbd98c59f6ccf9019febfb2417a97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43786c4bef8bbd98c59f6ccf9019febfb2417a97/0_0_3024_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heath Ledger\u2019s iconic portrayal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Why so serious?

In the presence of Michael Keaton\u2019s rather stiff Bruce Wayne, and the absence of a compelling plot, Burton wisely allowed Jack Nicholson to steal the show. With its over-the-top design, retro stylings and Prince soundtrack (plus a fairly uncritical view of mega-capitalism), you could say Burton\u2019s Batman was a very 1980s iteration.</p> <p>The success of Burton\u2019s Batman set the tone for some woeful sequels, but we would have to wait till <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/25/actionandadventure1\">Christopher Nolan\u2019s reign</a> for the properly \u201cdark\u201d Dark Knight promised by Miller and Moore, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/25/he-was-super-happy-heath-ledger-film-fights-perception-actor-was-depressed\">Heath Ledger</a>\u2019s unforgettable Joker interpretation is often held to be the conclusion of that journey towards three-dimensional characterisation (Jared Leto tried a little too hard to out-Ledger Ledger in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/07/suicide-squad-review-bad-film-margot-robbie-jared-leto\">Suicide Squad</a>).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/31/joker-review-twisted-tour-de-force-joaquin-phoenix\">Joker review \u2013 Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s villain has last laugh in twisted tale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How has the role endured? One distinguishing factor that is easily overlooked, points out Travis Langley, a psychology professor who has put many a pop-culture icon including the Joker on the couch, is that Batman has no actual superpowers. \u201cBecause Batman is defined by his personality, his enemies have to be as well. No other superhero has such a rich, well-known gallery of enemies, and the Joker is king of them all.\u201d As such, Joker and Batman\u2019s battleground has always been more psychological than physical, which is why Phillips\u2019s serious, straight Joker story fits in so seamlessly. Batman stories are as much about madness and sanity as good and evil; what other superhero world features the local mental asylum as a key location? But Langley hesitates to diagnose the Joker. \u201cHis behaviour does not neatly fit into any condition. The Joker is clearly a psychopath. He has no conscience. He has no empathy for anybody. He\u2019s this agent of chaos and you\u2019re just not sure, does he really know what he\u2019s doing or not?\u201d</p> <p>The Joker\u2019s real superpower is messing with other people\u2019s heads: Batman\u2019s, his henchmen, his adversaries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/22/margot-robbie-harley-quinn-metoo-dc\">his lover Harley Quinn</a>, Commissioner Gordon (in Alan Moore\u2019s The Killing Joke), Harvey Dent (in Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight), the people of Gotham (in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman), for example). In this light, it seems Joker the movie is being treated as another dastardly scheme to incite madness in the general populace.</p> <p>So should we be worried about the Joker\u2019s real-world potential for inciting chaos? We have been here many times before, not least with Joker\u2019s inspiration: Taxi Driver, and its part in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1982. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/john-hinckley-jr-release-ronald-reagan-assassination-attempt\">Shooter John Hinckley Jr was obsessed with the movie</a>. He watched it at least 15 times. He began to model himself on DeNiro\u2019s Travis Bickle, who plots a political assassination and becomes infatuated with a teenage prostitute, played by Jodie Foster. Hinckley dressed like Bickle, collected firearms like him, kept a diary like him, even drank peach brandy like him.

Bremer was another disturbed, lonely young man, obsessed with firearms and pornography, recently dumped by his 16-year-old girlfriend.

The media is now hard-wired to make links between movie and real-life violence, even when they\u2019re not there.

According to the Aurora trial prosecutor, the shooting could just as easily have happened during a showing of The Avengers or Jurassic World: \u201cIt had nothing to do, that we can find, with Batman.\u201d In the past week, however, relatives of those killed at the screening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/24/families-of-aurora-shooting-victims-condemn-gun-violence-in-joker\">have written a letter to Warners to express concerns about the film</a> (\u201cIt is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero\u201d was their response).</p> <p>Ironically, media sensationalism \u2013 a very 2019 theme \u2013 is very much core to Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIs it just me or is it getting crazier out there?\u201d Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s proto-Joker Arthur Fleck asks his psychologist in the new Joker movie. The real answer is both. Fleck is a man losing his grip on sanity, but the world \u201cout there\u201d is a powder keg of lawlessness, inequality, corruption, cuts and all-round despair. Joker\u2019s story is set around the early 1980s, but it consciously chimes with our own increasingly crazy present. \u201cThese are tough times,\u201d the psychologist acknowledges. She might as well turn and wink to the camera. It\u2019s no surprise that 2019\u2019s Joker \u2013 while set to be a triumph, critically and commercially \u2013 has raised concerns over its narrative. An early, leaked version of the script, plus the portrayal of Phoenix\u2019s character as a sad young man losing his grip on sanity (mental health problems, past trauma, failing comedy career, loneliness) has led to the film being aligned with so-called \u201cincel\u201d culture (involuntarily celibate men who are angry and misogynistic). Early reviewers have expressed concern over what messages the movie might be transmitting, and what actions it might inspire. \u201cIn America, there\u2019s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week,\u201d wrote Time\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek. Concerned by the part Fleck\u2019s unrequited love for his neighbour (Zazie Beetz) plays in his violent trajectory, she added \u201che could easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels\u201d. The Telegraph\u2019s Robbie Collin meanwhile wrote: \u201cMake no mistake, this is a film that is going stir up trouble,\u201d admitting he partly felt the film \u201cshould be locked in a strongbox then dropped in the ocean and never released\u201d. In a later interview, the Telegraph asked Phoenix if he was \u201cworried that this film might perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it\u2019s about, with potentially tragic results?\u201d Phoenix reportedly got up and walked out. Joker is not the first comic-book movie to sympathise with the bad guy, but it is the first to do it so one-sidedly. Superhero movies traditionally reassure us that good ultimately triumphs over evil, but Joker heads in the opposite direction. Fleck starts out as a decent but troubled soul.

Snip away the references to Gotham City and the Wayne family, and Joker is barely a comic-book movie at all, more a grim character study of snowballing defeat and humiliation, with no silver lining or caped crusader on the horizon. As the film-makers readily admit, and the casting of Robert DeNiro betrays, Joker follows in the footsteps of Martin Scorsese\u2019s triumphantly bleak 1970s/80s movies Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. But as critic David Ehrlich wrote in his Joker review: \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental difference between telling a story like this in the form of a dingy, misanthropic art film like Taxi Driver and telling it in the universal language of a superhero movie that\u2019s going to open in multiplexes the world over.

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 2003, my partner and I moved down to St Ives in our vintage camper van after I landed a job at a now-closed fish restaurant called Alba. There, I refined my fish-preparation skills and learned how to cook a piece of fish to perfection. </p> <p>With fish, quality is key, of course, but it was how they cooked the skin that really transformed my own fish cooking. Melt a tablespoon of clarified butter in an ovenproof pan or skillet over a medium heat. Lay in a fish fillet skin side down, and resist all temptation to touch it until the skin caramelises and browns on the edges and base. When the flesh turns opaque more than halfway through the fillet, pop the pan in a hot oven for a minute, or until only just cooked, then serve skin side up and enjoy the crisp, flavourful skin.</p> <p>If you\u2019re cooking for someone who won\u2019t eat fish skin, however, or if you\u2019re making a dish that calls for skinned fish, this snack transforms a by-product into something delicious.</p> <h2>Fish crackling</h2> <p>I\u2019d always recommend keeping the skin on a fish fillet where possible, but if a recipe does call for it to be removed, or you have guests who won\u2019t eat it, consider serving this alongside it, or as a garnish. Fish crackling has a superior texture that is simultaneously crunchy yet chewy, and umami-rich and satiating. It also keeps well in a sealed container, even for months, so long as it stays dry. I especially like it dipped in creme fraiche or soured cream with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper and a little dill. </p> <p><strong>Fish skin<br>Frying oil</strong> \u2013 organic rapeseed or virgin olive oil, for preference<br><strong>Sea salt</strong></p> <p>Bring a pan of water to a boil, lower in the fish skin and simmer for three minutes. Drain and pat dry with a clean cloth, then cut into rough pieces. Lay these on a wire rack and leave to dry, either in a warm part of the kitchen or in a low oven (preferably alongside something else, to maximise the power usage, and that doesn\u2019t matter if it smells of fish). Once the skin is totally dry, heat a dash of oil in a frying pan on a high heat, add the skin and cook until it puffs up and curls. Remove from the pan, season with salt and it\u2019s good to go, or cool and store.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 2003, my partner and I moved down to St Ives in our vintage camper van after I landed a job at a now-closed fish restaurant called Alba. There, I refined my fish-preparation skills and learned how to cook a piece of fish to perfection. With fish, quality is key, of course, but it was how they cooked the skin that really transformed my own fish cooking. Melt a tablespoon of clarified butter in an ovenproof pan or skillet over a medium heat. Lay in a fish fillet skin side down, and resist all temptation to touch it until the skin caramelises and browns on the edges and base. When the flesh turns opaque more than halfway through the fillet, pop the pan in a hot oven for a minute, or until only just cooked, then serve skin side up and enjoy the crisp, flavourful skin. If you\u2019re cooking for someone who won\u2019t eat fish skin, however, or if you\u2019re making a dish that calls for skinned fish, this snack transforms a by-product into something delicious. Fish crackling I\u2019d always recommend keeping the skin on a fish fillet where possible, but if a recipe does call for it to be removed, or you have guests who won\u2019t eat it, consider serving this alongside it, or as a garnish. Fish crackling has a superior texture that is simultaneously crunchy yet chewy, and umami-rich and satiating. It also keeps well in a sealed container, even for months, so long as it stays dry. I especially like it dipped in creme fraiche or soured cream with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper and a little dill. Fish skin Frying oil \u2013 organic rapeseed or virgin olive oil, for preference Sea salt Bring a pan of water to a boil, lower in the fish skin and simmer for three minutes. Drain and pat dry with a clean cloth, then cut into rough pieces. Lay these on a wire rack and leave to dry, either in a warm part of the kitchen or in a low oven (preferably alongside something else, to maximise the power usage, and that doesn\u2019t matter if it smells of fish). Once the skin is totally dry, heat a dash of oil in a frying pan on a high heat, add the skin and cook until it puffs up and curls. Remove from the pan, season with salt and it\u2019s good to go, or cool and store.",

      "bodyText": "Trump administration changes to US refugee policy are \u201ctantamount to destroying the program\u201d, according to experts, as the amount of people displaced worldwide continues to grow. On Thursday, the administration announced it would set a refugee cap of 18,000 people for the fiscal year, which begins 1 October. It also issued an executive order allowing states or \u201clocal governments\u201d to ban refugee resettlement. In practice, experts warned, not only will fewer people be able to enter the US than ever before, but these decisions will pull apart the infrastructure that supports refugees when they arrive in the US. Families will therefore struggle to stay together. Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy at Church World Services, said the move was \u201ctantamount to destroying the program\u201d. Advocates are especially concerned about 8,000 refugees who have been approved for travel to the US and may now have their journeys delayed or cancelled. \u201cThis is actually the United States becoming a bad actor when it comes to refugee protection,\u201d Smyers said. \u201cThis is the United States saying \u2013 during a time when the world is facing the largest displacement crisis in history \u2013 the US is going to roll up its mat and go home. It\u2019s really astounding\u201d Senior US officials said on a call with reporters the cap was set so low because the administration is struggling to respond to the number of people seeking asylum at the southern border. In fact, the asylum program is distinct from the refugee program. The Department of Homeland Security, with the justice department, oversees asylum applications. The state department oversees refugee resettlement. Both work with other agencies, including each other. Smyers said the White House claim was a \u201cbold-face lie\u201d. \u2018The US allowed me to send my kids safely to school\u2019 Since the refugee system was formalized in 1980, the US has on average set an admission ceiling of 95,000 a year \u2013 though it often falls short of that cap. Even after 9/11, the US admitted about 27,100 refugees in 2002 and 28,000 in 2003. Refugee resettlement is a slow process that involves the most intense scrutiny of any form of US immigration. On taking office, Donald Trump ordered a review of the vetting system, which the administration has since deemed secure. Basma Alawee resettled in Orlando, Florida, in 2010, with her husband and young daughter. They had lived in Iraq through several wars but her husband\u2019s work as a translator for the US military put their lives in danger. Alawee said the new refugee cap was lower than she expected and she was worried for families waiting to be reunited with relatives. \u201cI really love this country because this country allowed me to practice my freedom, to speak freely, to practice my religion,\u201d Alawee said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to have a home and send my kids safely to school and I want to see other people enjoying that too.\u201d Alawee, who trained as a chemical engineer, worked as a teacher in the US and became an activist after Trump implemented his travel ban on certain Muslim-majority nations. She is now the director of the We Are All America campaign in Florida, advocating for refugee rights, and the Florida delegate for the Refugee Congress. She was pleased the refugee announcement included a specific mention of Iraqis, but was concerned about how low that figure was. While the state department usually specifies how many refugees can come from regions such as Africa and the Middle East, the White House proposal made some unusual distinctions. The government carved out 1,500 slots for people from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Last year, it admitted 502 from those countries, according to state figures. There are 5,000 slots reserved for people fleeing religious persecution, though it is not clear how that determination is made. There are 4,000 spots for Iraqis who helped the US. At the end of July, more than 100,000 had applied, according to Reuters. The final 7,500 spots are for everyone else. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned people interviewed and who are able to get on a plane right away will not be able to come based on these numbers,\u201d said Jennifer Sime, the senior vice-president of US programs at the International Rescue Committee (IRC). \u2018We used to be a beacon of hope\u2019 Sime said that along with the lower ceiling, it will be harder for families to reunite if the order to allow states and \u201clocal governments\u201d to ban refugees survives anticipated legal challenges. Reunification has become more difficult because of the shrinking number of resettlement agency offices, which help refugees on things such as how to buy a home, find language courses or get a job. More than 100 offices have closed down, according to Refugee Council USA, because there are too few people to process. More are expected to close. When refugees flee their homes, family members often lose touch, putting their refugee applications on different timelines. If a mother and child have arrived in Maine, for instance, and it suddenly stops allowing refugees, reunification will be delayed as the family tries to travel to another state to file the father\u2019s application. The same could be true if Maine simply has to shut down resettlement agencies because not enough people are coming in. Refugees have often lost family members and may form close ties with uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents, but it is more difficult to get the government to prioritize reunification with such relatives. If parts of the country become islands for refugees, this will only get more complicated. \u201cWhat\u2019s sad is I don\u2019t think the US wants to be a world leader in refugee resettlement anymore,\u201d Sime said. \u201cWe used to be, and that used to be something people were proud of, that we were this beacon of hope and freedom for people who had been persecuted throughout the world, regardless of where they came from, and that is certainly not something this administration is interested in upholding.\u201d",

It\u2019s that Nixon\u2019s abuse of power was discovered during his second term, after he was re-elected. He was still a dangerous crook, but by that time he had no reason to inflict still more damage on American democracy. Trump\u2019s abuse has been uncovered 14 months before the 2020 election, at a time when he still has every incentive to do whatever he can to win. If special counsel Robert Mueller had found concrete evidence that Trump asked Vladimir Putin for help in digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton in 2016, that would have been the \u201csmoking gun\u201d that could have ended the Trump presidency. Now Trump is revealed to have asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, for dirt on Joe Biden in the 2020 election, who\u2019s to say he isn\u2019t also soliciting Vladimir Putin\u2019s help this time around?

      "bodyText": "It will be the political fight of the century. Donald Trump is the first president since the 1990s to face impeachment by Congress. At best for him, it will be the dirtiest, most humiliating battle yet of a tumultuous political career. At worst, it will be the death blow to his presidency. In a week for the history books, Trump was revealed to have used the powers of the Oval Office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election for his personal political interests \u2013 an abuse that the White House then tried to cover up. Democrats moved swiftly to launch an impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that detailed how Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to help smear a political rival, the former vice-president Joe Biden. It set the stage for weeks of partisan trench warfare likely to deepen national divisions. But it also offered a sliver of hope to Trump\u2019s critics: that he could be drummed out of office by Christmas.

      "bodyText": "The RSPCA has accused the federal government of making a \u201cbackflip on animal welfare safeguards\u201d with the release of a policy document outlining options for the live export of sheep to the Middle East. The discussion paper, released on Friday, outlines four possible options to govern the live sheep export trade from Australia to the Middle East from 2020 onwards. Agriculture minister Bridget McKenzie said her department was seeking feedback from stakeholders on the economic and regulatory impact of each of the proposed options, but that it would \u201calso welcome alternative options\u201d. It forms part of an ongoing overhaul of the industry following the release of whistleblower footage by Animals Australia in 2018 that showed carcasses thrown overboard and sheep panting from heat stress on a deadly voyage aboard the live export ship Awassi Express. The exporter involved is currently facing criminal charges for animal cruelty. As a result, three reviews were conducted, including a review of the heat stress risk assessment model, which determines how much space sheep need in different conditions. Of the four options in the discussion paper, only option three proposes adopting the new heat stress guidelines. That option, the paper said, would \u201csignificantly lower the risk that any sheep exported to the Middle East would experience unsatisfactory welfare from heat stress in any given month.\u201d It would also \u201cprohibit or substantially reduce\u201d live export between May and September, when temperatures around the Gulf countries are at their height, and reduce stocking densities in October by 40-60%. The RSPCA said option three was the only viable proposal but the failure to include a summer trade ban as well as following the government\u2019s own advice on heat stress was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and \u201ca significant backwards stumble\u201d for animal welfare. \u201cThe only viable option to protect the welfare of Australian live exported sheep while the trade continues is to prohibit the highest risk months of the year \u2026 and introduce the revised heat stress risk assessment model, which the government has already committed to doing on multiple occasions,\u201d a statement from the RSPCA said. The first option in the discussion paper is to introduce a three-month ban during the hottest part of the Middle Eastern summer, with the existing heat stress risk assessment model \u2014 which allows for significantly higher stocking densities than the updated model \u2014 operating for the remaining nine months of the year. The report said that option carried a risk of a heat stress incident in the \u201cshoulder\u201d months of May or September. Option two proposed permanently adopting the live export ban that was imposed this year, which prevented any shipments leaving Australia between 1 June and 22 September, while maintaining the old heat stress model the rest of the time. A fourth option proposed no prohibition or new restrictions on trade, which the department said would carry a \u201csignificant risk of a heat stress incident.\u201d The RSPCA said the only acceptable solution was a combination of options two and three. \u201cAny other course of action is not backed by the science or evidence; and represents a backflip on the government\u2019s previous assurances, as well as an unmitigated failure to act on the community\u2019s concerns,\u201d it said. Live exports from Australia to the Middle East resumed on Monday. Live sheep exports account for 0.5% of Australia\u2019s total agriculture exports and industry figures say it underpins 3,450 jobs in regional Australia. About 80% of the 2 million sheep exported live each year come from Western Australia, where about 30% of sheep sold off the farm go to live export. By allowing ships to leave WA in May, the discussion paper said, it would be able to take sheep turned off at the end of the growing season. The discussion paper is open for public comment until 28 October.",

      "body": "<p>Having woken with the sense it was all ending \u2013 light, warmth, growth, much else \u2013 I am pulled to the river. But when I arrive, it is brown, low and so lethargic the flow would be imperceptible if not for a few early-fallen leaves and small blobs of spittly scum. My mood isn\u2019t helped by the state of the banks, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/05/country-diary-the-explosive-impatience-of-himalayan-balsam\">Himalayan balsam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=241\">hedge bindweed</a> seem locked in a grim, ugly-sister tussle.</p> <p>I walk. A grey heron cranks into the air, trailing orange legs and so <em>begrudging</em> the cost of two heavy wingbeats that I can\u2019t help but smile. He alights and I avert my gaze as he reorganises his wings, so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to move again.</p> <p>A fallen willow blocks the path, so I slither down the bank to the \u201cbeach\u201d, a strip of silt scarcely half a metre wide. Sometimes, when the river is dropping, this narrow margin becomes a canvas on which there are \u2013 yes! \u2013 footprints.

      "bodyText": "Having woken with the sense it was all ending \u2013 light, warmth, growth, much else \u2013 I am pulled to the river. But when I arrive, it is brown, low and so lethargic the flow would be imperceptible if not for a few early-fallen leaves and small blobs of spittly scum. My mood isn\u2019t helped by the state of the banks, where Himalayan balsam and hedge bindweed seem locked in a grim, ugly-sister tussle. I walk. A grey heron cranks into the air, trailing orange legs and so begrudging the cost of two heavy wingbeats that I can\u2019t help but smile. He alights and I avert my gaze as he reorganises his wings, so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to move again. A fallen willow blocks the path, so I slither down the bank to the \u201cbeach\u201d, a strip of silt scarcely half a metre wide. Sometimes, when the river is dropping, this narrow margin becomes a canvas on which there are \u2013 yes! \u2013 footprints. At first I can\u2019t be sure, but they become more distinct as I follow them upstream. Round pad, round toes that made deeper impressions as they gripped, and here\u2019s one showing claws.

Seasoned Newcastle sailors Chris Doran, his cousin Kevin Doran and Ben Johnson, from Vanuatu, had spent months in the South Pacific and were headed back to Queensland when their boat, Liberty, struck a discarded mooring line about 5.30am on Thursday and began to sink. The men told friends they were leaving Vanuatu for the Gold Coast on Monday. The journey is a popular one with Australian sailors and takes five days of round-the-clock sailing in good weather, longer with stops and day sailing. The P&amp;O cruise ship Pacific Dawn picked up their emergency beacon and collected the men several hours later near the coast of New Caledonia, without even having to alter its route. \u201cInitially we thought we might have hit a reef but that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d Chris Doran told reporters in Brisbane after the cruise ship docked on Saturday morning. \u201cWe found quite a large ship\u2019s rope, there was about 50 metres of it and it wrapped around both propellers causing a breach in the hull, the boat started taking on water.\u201d Realising their boat was going under, the men made a May Day call, grabbed their passports and some water before piling into a life raft. Doran told reporters he had sailed the Liberty for six years and was sorry to lose it, but knew it could not be saved. More pressing was the risk the lifeboat would be overturned in rough seas, or float dangerously toward the reef, which was just six nautical miles \u2014 11km \u2014 away. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about the boat because we couldn\u2019t save it, there was no way we could\u2019ve saved it,\u201d he told Nine newspapers.

It was a very easy rescue, Dockeray said. Dockeray had been piloting 2,000 passengers in a seven-day cruise around the South Pacific and said he had rescued sailors from the waters around Vanuatu before. \u201cThe reefs there are unforgiving but these guys didn\u2019t find a reef, they found a mooring line,\u201d Dockeray said.

Earlier on Friday, in a congressional letter delivered to Pompeo, three House committees demanded documents as part of their investigation into \u201cthe extent to which President Trump jeopardised national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression\u201d. The chairmen of the intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees also warned Pompeo that \u201cyour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry\u201d. The committees sent a separate note to Pompeo notifying him of a rapid schedule of depositions they expected to hold with five state department officials involved in contacts with Ukraine. The list begins next Wednesday with the former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was forced to retire from the post in May, earlier than planned. Trump, according to the White House version of his 25 July conversation with Zelenskiy, was scathing about Yovanovitch, referring to her as \u201cthe woman\u201d who was \u201cbad news\u201d, and who was \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d. Volker is due to appear on 3 October, the day after Yovanovitch\u2019s scheduled deposition. Giuliani has publicly displayed text messages purportedly from Volker, about a meeting he had helped arrange with a Zelenskiy aide. Giuliani was seeking to persuade the Kyiv government to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former vice-president Joe Biden, one of the frontrunners in the Democratic primary for next year\u2019s presidential election. Giuliani himself again came under scrutiny on Friday when it emerged he had accepted a paid slot to speak at a Moscow-backed conference next week that Putin is expected to attend. The appearance was promptly cancelled after a report by the Washington Post. The younger Biden had been on the board of an Ukrainian energy company, but an Ukrainian investigation found no evidence of impropriety. Shortly before making the call to Zelenskiy in July, to press him further on investigating Biden, Trump ordered the suspension of US military aid to Ukraine. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Pompeo claimed to have been too busy to read more than a couple of paragraphs of the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine, and insisted that no state department official had done anything inappropriate. In their letter to Pompeo, the three committee chairman, noted that he had first been asked to hand over relevant documentation on 9 September, but had not complied. \u201cYour actions are all the more troubling given that since our 9 September request, it has become clear that multiple state department officials have direct knowledge of the subject matters of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d the chairmen \u2013 Democrats Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings \u2013 said. Pompeo\u2019s continued refusal to hand over the documents, they added, would impair Congress\u2019s \u201cconstitutional responsibilities to protect our national security and the integrity of our democracy\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The two fugitives responsible for a frantic manhunt across Canada recorded video confessions for the murders of three people \u2013 and planned for more victims before killing themselves, police revealed Friday. At a press conference in Vancouver, the Royal Canadian Mounted police released a 13-page report detailing key findings of the extensive investigation, including the recovery six videos and three images from a camera. In one video, 58 seconds in length, Bryer Schmegelsky and Kam McLeod claimed responsibility for two murders near a small town in northern British Columbia on 15 July 2019. The two targeted a tourist couple travelling in the region; police found American Chynna Deese, 24, and Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, with multiple gunshot wounds near their camper van. Schmegelsky and McLeod also admitted to killing Vancouver botanist Leonard Dyck, whose body \u2013 found with a single gunshot wound \u2013 was discovered on 19 July. But nowhere in the videos do the two young men express remorse for the murders, nor do they provide insights into the motivation behind their killing spree. \u201cThey were cold. They were remorseless, matter of fact,\u201d RCMP assistant commissioner Kevin Hackett told reporters. The grim events kicked off one of the most extensive manhunts in Canadian history as the two young men fled across the country, eluding search teams for weeks. They passed over mountains and open prairie fields before finally slowing down amid the thick, swampy forests of northern Manitoba \u2013 a journey of nearly 3,000 km. Police used drones, dogs and heat seeking cameras in the search for Schmegelsky, 18, and McLeod, 19. At one point, the Canadian military was deployed to comb through vast tracks of impenetrable wilderness. It was only after discovering a series of items police believe were linked the young men near the town of Gillam, that their bodies were eventually found along the banks of a river on 7 August, more than two weeks after the exhaustive search had begun. Police have decided not to release the videos \u201cin an effort not to sensationalize the actions of McLeod and Schmeglsky\u201d which could, in turn, prompt further acts of violence. \u201cThose who commit mass casualty attacks are heavily inspired by previous attackers and their behaviours,\u201d the police report said. From the videos, the police learned the two had initially intended to trek up northern Manitoba to Hudson Bay, where they would steal a boat and travel to either Europe or Africa. But the fast-moving river where they spent their last days affected their ability to move, and in one video, they suggest they will likely have to kill themselves. \u201cWe believe the location where they ended up affected their mobility,\u201d said Hackett. Knowing they were in their final days, McLeod and Schmegelsky shaved themselves, \u201cplan[ning] to go back and kill more people and expect[ing] to be dead in a week,\u201d said the police report. According to forensic evidence, it is believed McLeod shot Schmegelsky with a rifle, before turning the weapon on himself. Police were also able to match the bullets used to kill Fowler and Deese to the murder of Dyck, nearly 500 kilometres away. The same guns were also used in the suicide of the two young men and were found with them in Manitoba. One, a semiautomatic rifle, was purchased legally by McLeod. The other, police said, was built using multiple parts from a number of different guns. Police also released details of a chilling encounter along the Alaska Highway, two days after Fowler and Deese were killed. A driver had pulled over along the road to nap, but saw a man with a gun approaching his car. \u201cThe male \u2026 started moving towards the witness in a tactical or hunting stance,\u201d the report said. The driver quickly sped away. As part of the investigation, police spoke extensively with family and friends, all of whom initially refused to believe the pair could be capable of cold-blooded violence, describing them as \u201cgood kids\u201d. After their abandoned vehicle was discovered, McLeod and Schmegelsky had initially been described to the public as missing persons. But on July 22, a witness approached police and suggested the two might have been involved in the murders. \u201cThis is the first time that police learned that McLeod and Schmegelsky may be capable of the murders which conflicted with original witness statements from family and associates,\u201d the report said. The press conference and report mark the end of the high-profile case, in which police said they received more than 1,000 tips, but were nonetheless unable to determine a motivation for the crimes.

The results of the investigation were published by the Oregon senator Ron Wyden on Friday. The report also alleges that the NRA may have broken tax laws by using donated funds to further its officers\u2019 business interests. Wyden and other Democrats on the Senate finance committee found that a delegation of NRA officials traveled to Moscow in December 2015. The trip was coordinated with Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin, who are both Russian. Butina is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence after she tried to infiltrate US conservative groups and the NRA to promote Russian political interests around the 2016 election. While in Russia the NRA met with \u201ca host of senior level Kremlin officials\u201d, Wyden said. Those officials included Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, who oversaw defense and munitions industries. After the trip to Russia, the NRA allowed Butina to bring a delegation from Russia to its influential annual meeting.

      "bodyText": "Witnesses to Monday\u2019s deadly riots in West Papua claim Indonesian police gunned down Papuan students in the street during the unrest, and say Wamena has since become a militarised ghost town. Witness testimony from Wamena, the largest town in Papua\u2019s remote Baliem Valley, run in stark contrast to the Indonesian authorities\u2019 official account. Indonesian police have said 31 people died in the racism-fuelled riot, but claim the majority of victims were non-Papuan migrants who died from stab and arrow wounds, and from being trapped inside burning buildings. But since Monday\u2019s riot, the Guardian has spoken to several witnesses who suggest not only that the death toll may be significantly higher than the official toll, but also that the Indonesian police may have been involved. *Lukas, a 19-year-old Papuan college student who joined the demonstration on Monday, said that as the chaos unfolded on the street, the police opened fire on students, who fought back. \u201cStudents were coming to the street from all different directions as shophouses, cars and motorbikes were all on fire,\u201d Lukas said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the police and military came.

There were about 16 to 20 people who died directly on the street that I saw.\u201d Papua police spokesperson Ahmad Mustofa Kamal told the Guardian this account was not true. Indonesia\u2019s chief of police said earlier in the week that just four indigenous Papuans had been killed in the Wamena unrest. Yet one witness account from inside the Wamena general hospital suggests there were more, and that many of the dead were children. The witness, Thomas*, said he saw several victims being brought to the hospital on Monday, including two migrant women hit by rocks, and a young Papuan student who had been shot in the back. The bullet had ripped through the side of his stomach. \u201cHe was yelling \u2018I feel like I\u2019m dying\u2019,\u201d Thomas told the Guardian. \u201cAs more bodies were brought into the hospital, I could see many non-Papuans injured from being hit by rocks and other sharp weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cBut many Papuans were injured from gunshots.\u201d Thomas says the following day he saw six Papuan bodies laid out in the hospital\u2019s morgue, who all appeared to be of \u201chigh school age\u201d. With internet services blocked and phone lines initially down and subsequently disrupted, it has been difficult to obtain a full picture of the horror that unfolded in Wamena on Monday, which Amnesty International has described as \u201cone of the bloodiest days in Papua in 20 years\u201d.

Indonesian police claim this is \u201cfake news\u201d and that pro-independence figures dressed up in school uniforms to provoke trouble. But interviews with a teacher from the high school where the incident allegedly occurred, and with students involved, suggest students joined of their own volition. It was on Saturday 22 September that a migrant teacher allegedly called a Papuan high school student a \u201cmonkey\u201d \u2013 the same racist insult that last month sparked mass riots across Indonesia after a similar incident occurred in the Javanese city of Surabaya. By Sunday, the claims had been widely shared by students on their phones as they planned Monday\u2019s demonstration, ultimately motivating some 5,000 students to the streets. One teacher from the school, Michael Alua, said the teachers had attempted to make peace, but neither side would concede, with the teacher denying that word was ever said, and the students insisting it was. On Monday morning the students were so incensed they demanded the teacher be reported to the police. \u201cThey call us monkeys, but we are not monkeys,\u201d said Lukas, when asked why he got involved. In the days since the deadly violence, there has been a strong army presence on the streets of Wamena, and shops, schools and gas stations have been closed. Meanwhile, thousands of migrants have fled, some boarding military flights to Jayapura, while indigenous Papuans have returned to villages on the outskirts of town. After the riot, thousands sought refuge in churches and in police and military buildings, as parts of the town were torched and covered in towering plumes of smoke. The regent\u2019s office was burned to the ground. Houses, shops, cars and the market were also set on fire. At least four sources told the Guardian that \u201cmigrants\u201d (non-indigenous Papuans), who dominate economic life in Wamena, are now walking the streets carrying machetes and iron sticks. One source told the Guardian that \u201cpeople in Wamena are afraid to go out\u201d. The source said the shutdown of the internet and other modes of communication had exacerbated people\u2019s fears of further violence and fuelled \u201cugly rumours\u201d circulating the city. \u201cThe settlers [migrants] are guarding their houses with machetes in their hands, and the Papuans are traumatised, and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u201cThousands of migrants are fleeing the city, they want to be evacuated and they are being facilitated by the government, but Papuans are also terrified. They are thinking, \u2018if the government is so quick to help settlers leave, what is being planned after that?\u2019 There is currently that uncertainty.\u201d A leaked police memo, sent from the Papua police chief to his deputy and other officials, urges police and military to prepare weapons and ammunition \u201cwhere they can be easily accessed\u201d and warns non-Papuans to be vigilant and \u201cstay temporarily in a safe place\u201d. The memo, the authenticity of which was confirmed to the Guardian by the police, instructed officers to be aware of student groups, particularly \u201cexodus students\u201d, in reference to those returning to Papua from other parts of Indonesia. In recent weeks more than 1,000 Papuan students have returned home from other areas in Indonesia, fuelled by anger over racism that Papuans say they have long endured. Monday\u2019s riot has for the second time painfully revealed how inflammable structural racism has become in West Papua, fuelling not just protests but a movement for independence from Indonesia. \u201cPapuan students are tired of racism and want to stand up for themselves,\u201d Linus Hiluka, a former political prisoner who lives in Wamena, told the Guardian. \u201cThey want their own story.\u201d *Name has been changed to protect their identity",

      "bodyText": "What a day. Have a good weekend, everybody! White House aides \u201ctook remarkable steps\u201d to keep President Trump\u2019s phone calls with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin from becoming public, reports CNN. Kurt Volker, special envoy for Ukraine, resigned from his post after his name emerged in the whistleblower report. The first House Republican has come out in support of an impeachment inquiry. Rudy Giuliani texted people about a Kremlin-linked conference he was scheduled to speak at and then no longer scheduled to speak at. President Trump met with Wayne LaPierre about the NRA funding his impeachment defense in exchange for his administration calming down talk around gun control. Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada released a statement today saying he supported an impeachment inquiry but \u201cin no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment.\u201d The NRA has responded to the New York Times report that Wayne LaPierre met with President Trump to discuss providing financial support as he faces impeachment in exchange for opposing gun control legislation: In a week when phone calls between President Trump and world leaders are under more scrutiny than ever, CNN is reporting that White House aides \u201ctook remarkable steps\u201d to keep Trump\u2019s calls with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin from becoming public. From CNN: In the case of Trump\u2019s call with Prince Mohammed, officials who ordinarily would have been given access to a rough transcript of the conversation never saw one, according to one of the sources. Instead, a transcript was never circulated at all, which the source said was highly unusual, particularly after a high-profile conversation. The call - which the person said contained no especially sensitive national security secrets - came as the White House was confronting the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence assessments said came at the hand of the Saudi government. With Putin, access to the transcript of at least one of Trump\u2019s conversations was also tightly restricted, according to a former Trump administration official. It\u2019s unclear if aides took the same steps in securing the phone call Trump had with Ukraine\u2019s president that became the subject a whistleblower complaint, but \u201cofficials confirmed calls aside from the Ukraine conversation were placed there.\u201d So, who needs a brief recap of this whole shebang? This week, a whistleblower accused President Trump of pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden. Two US diplomats are mentioned in the whistleblower report on Trump\u2019s relations with Kyiv: part-time special envoy Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the EU. The Arizona State Press, Arizona State University\u2019s student newspaper, broke the news today that Volker has resigned. If you\u2019ll recall, the Trump administration and the self-fashioned \u201cresistance state of California don\u2019t exactly see eye-to-eye. As of today, California has filed 62 lawsuits against the Trump administration. California has especially butted heads with Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency, which just last week revoked the state\u2019s authority to set emission standards for cars and trucks. Per usual, California vowed to fight the decision in court and filed a lawsuit. Since then, the EPA escalated the feud by accusing the state of failing to stop water pollution from human waste left on the pavement by the homeless - an echo of comments made by President Trump when he was leaving California last week. Senator Dianne Feinstein has now written to the EPA\u2019s deputy inspector general, asking for an investigation into \u201cwhether there was inappropriate political interference\u201d. While there could be a number of things to choose from, Feinstein is specifically asking the deputy inspector general to look into \u201cthe recent threat\u201d from EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler to withhold transportation funding from California. More details on Rudy Giuliani and the Kremlin-linked conference he was scheduled to speak at, and then abruptly no longer planning to attend: The New York Times report that President Trump met with Wayne LaPierre today to discuss the NRA funding some of Trump\u2019s impeachment defense in exchange for Trump opposing gun control legislation has started to garner some reaction from lawmakers: The meeting took place the same the day a Senate report declared the NRA a \u201cforeign asset\u201d to Russia ahead of the 2016 election. Welcome to the state of our political discourse, where everything is either breaking or already broken: at 1:58pm PDT, Rudy Giuliani was still going to the Kremlin-backed conference along with Russian President Vladimir Putin. By 2:39pm: With all eyes on Trump and his inner circle over allegations that he pressured Ukrainian officials for dirt on a political rival, his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani chose this moment to ignore all Ukraine-Russia tensions and accept a gig as a paid speaker at a Kremlin-backed conference that Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to attend. Giuliani confirmed his participation to the Washington Post, taking exception to any questions of impropriety. \u201cI will try to not knowingly talk to a Russian until this is all over,\u201d he angrily told the Post. National security experts called Giuliani\u2019s decision \u201cterrible judgment,\u201d and \u201ccurrent and former White House aides said there is internal exasperation with Giuliani\u2019s behavior\u201d. Let\u2019s just hope he doesn\u2019t call any of his fellow panelists a moron this time around. Hey all, it\u2019s Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over for the indomitable Joan Greve. Since absolutely nothing happened in politics this week, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re in for a quiet rest of the day. The New York Times is reporting that President Trump met with Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, to discuss today how the NRA could provide him with financial support as he faces impeachment. This meeting comes after Trump claimed he spoke to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about gun control and accused her of not being interested in the matter. That\u2019s it from me for this very busy week in Washington. My west coast colleague, Vivian Ho, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Three House Democratic committee chairmen have subpoenaed the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to provide documents on the whistleblower complaint about Trump allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. The Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, confirmed that his panel will likely hold an impeachment hearing next week (during the congressional recess). The former Ukrainian prosecutor who first investigated corruption claims against a company with ties to Hunter Biden said he met with Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal layer, \u201cmaybe 10 times\u201d. He added that he has seen no evidence that the Bidens broke Ukrainian law. Nancy Pelosi confirmed that the Ukraine call would be the focus of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry moving forward and pledged to \u201cmove with purpose, and expeditiously, but not hastily\u201d. Trump is continuing to attempt to discredit the whistleblower, now peddling a baseless claim that the person fabricated sources for the complaint. Vivian will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned and have a wonderful weekend. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee are spending $10 million to air this incredibly misleading ad about Joe Biden and Ukraine on cable news outlets and digital platforms. The ad repeats several falsehoods that Trump has peddled this week in an effort to distract from the whistleblower complaint about his call with the Ukrainian president. First of all, there is no evidence to support claims that Biden tried to pressure Ukraine to close an investigation into the business activities of his son, Hunter. The former Ukrainian prosecutor who first investigated corruption claims against the company with ties to Hunter Biden has dismissed the allegation. Second, Democrats are not concerned about Trump encouraging Ukraine to crack down on corruption. They are concerned he pushed Ukraine to investigate Biden to hurt his chances in the 2020 election. And media outlets have been reporting on the whistleblower complaint because of the very serious allegations contained in it, not because of any secret agenda to collude with the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway is blaming House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump on ... sexism? But the argument that Nancy Pelosi was intimidated into supporting an impeachment inquiry by male lawmakers does not align with the reality that almost every woman in the House Democratic caucus has backed the investigation. In their letter to Mike Pompeo, the three House Democratic committee chairman specifically express an interest in the role that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, played in pressuring Ukraine to open an investigation of Joe Biden. The chairmen write to the secretary of state: \u201cMr. Giuliani\u2019s recent public statements raise more troubling questions about State Department officials\u2019 possible involvement in the President\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d They go on to specifically reference comments Giuliani has made on television and this tweet he sent, showing an apparent screenshot of a text from Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine. The three House Democratic committee chairman stress in their letter to Mike Pompeo that the secretary of state has already twice refused to comply with their requests for documents on the whistleblower complaint. The chairmen write: \u201cYour actions are all the more troubling given that since our September 9 request, it has become clear that multiple State Department officials have direct knowledge of the subject matters of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\u201d Pompeo was given until next Friday, Oct. 4, to hand over the requested documents to the committee. The three House Democratic committee chairmen gave a stern warning to Mike Pompeo about not providing the requested documents by the Oct. 4 deadline. The chairmen wrote to the secretary of state: \u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\u201d The Trump administration has repeatedly deflected such document requests from House Democrats this year, but the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry could make that evasion tactic much more difficult to pursue. The three House Democratic chairmen noted in their letter to Mike Pompeo that they have set a schedule for depositions over the next two weeks from five State Department officials who are connected to the whistleblower complaint. Here is the schedule: October 2: Marie \u201cMasha\u201d Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. October 3: Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine. October 7: George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau. October 8: Ulrich Brechbuhl, one of Pompeo\u2019s key deputies. October 10: Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. Three House committees have subpoenaed secretary of state Mike Pompeo for information on the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Three House Democratic chairs \u2013 Adam Schiff of the intelligence commitee, Eliot Engel of the foreign affairs committee and Elijah Cummings of the oversight committee \u2013 wrote a letter to Pompeo requesting documents. The three chairs wrote: \u201cPursuant to the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 4, 2019.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg explained his reasoning for supporting the impeachment inquiry against Trump while speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. The Indiana mayor said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where the rule of law and our constitutional system requires holding this president accountable for what he\u2019s done. ... \u201cThis is not just about this moment or about this president. This is about the integrity of the system \u2013 because the whole system is designed so that when this sort of thing happens, there\u2019s a constitutional remedy. If we didn\u2019t use that remedy, the entire system could fall apart.\u201d Buttigieg added that Democrats will have to do two things at once as they pursue the impeachment inquiry: hold Trump accountable and work to make sure he does not win a second term. Trump\u2019s White House appears to be handling the impeachment inquiry with the same haphazard approach that has defined much of the administration\u2019s work. The New York Times reports: [Trump] heads into what appears to be a rapidly unfurling impeachment inquiry unprepared temperamentally, and with a depleted staff, many of whom are shrugging off the seriousness of what the president faces. ... Having a formal war room, or rapid response operation, \u2018would be overreaction on our part,\u2019 said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president. \u2018It would be playing on the Democrats\u2019 turf.\u2019 And if impeachment succeeds, Trump officials are anticipating a Republican-held Senate that would not permit witnesses to testify at length and would not convict him. Mr. Trump, aides said, shares that view, and on Thursday he expressed no interest in building a war room to respond to what he views as an effort by congressional Democrats to harass him. The Democratic chairs of the House committees on the budget and appropriations are requesting information from the White House on when it decided to hold back military aid from Ukraine. Some Democrats have voiced their suspicion that Trump held back the military aid specifically to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into Joe Biden. The chairs, John Yarmuth of Kentucky and Nita Lowey of New York, write in a letter to Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff and the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget that they fear the president may have unlawfully violated the Impoundment Control Act and abused his authority. The Trump White House has become pretty adept at swatting away such information requests from House Democrats, but the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry could turn up the pressure to be transparent, an NPR reporter noted. Former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said in an interview that he spoke with Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, \u201cmaybe 10 times.\u201d Giuliani was reportedly the key player from Trump\u2019s circle of advisers involved in efforts to convince the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into Joe Biden and the business dealings of his son, Hunter. Lutsenko, who initially investigated the company at the center of the baseless accusations against the Bidens, told NBC News that he did not know of \u201cany possible violation of Ukrainian law, once again, Ukrainian law by Biden and by the junior.\u201d John Harris, the founding editor of Politico, has written a piece about how the impeachment inquiry against Trump lacks the \u201csolemnity\u201d that such significant news events should carry. Harris blames the loss of solemnity on a trend that began with the impeachment of Bill Clinton, which he covered as a reporter for the Washington Post. Harris writes: It is too early to tell what will come of House Democrats\u2019 decision to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, but not too early to conclude that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has failed to revive the concept of solemnity in American politics. ... [T]he reaction, underway even before she started speaking, made clear that for much of the country, it was just another day in what Rahm Emanuel, when he was Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, called the metropolis of \u2018Fucknutsville.\u2019 ... In retrospect, it seems clear what a critical moment of transition the Clinton impeachment \u2014 for that matter, the entire Clinton presidency \u2014 was in the journey to Nutsville. ... Above all, the Clinton impeachment was the beginning of political news as Rorschach test \u2014 in which one side sees wickedness in a politician\u2019s behavior, and the other side sees wickedness in the disingenuous, hypocritical, malicious response of the opposition party to the behavior. More than 300 former national security and foreign policy officials, who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, signed a statement warning that Trump\u2019s actions represent a \u201cprofound national security concern.\u201d The statement reads, in part: [A]ll of us recognize the imperative of formal impeachment proceedings to ascertain additional facts and weigh the consequences of what we have learned and what may yet still emerge. We applaud those Members of Congress, including Speaker Pelosi, who have now started us down that necessary path. President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes. That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power. It also would represent an effort to subordinate America\u2019s national interests\u2014and those of our closest allies and partners\u2014to the President\u2019s personal political interest. ... To be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress\u2019 deliberative process. At the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings. A small update from the Democratic presidential primary: Cory Booker\u2019s campaign announced it has raised more than $1.2 million since sending out its weekend fundraising plea. Booker\u2019s campaign manager said in a Saturday email to the New Jersey senator\u2019s supporters that he intended to drop out if he did not raise another $1.7 million in the third quarter, which ends on September 30. It appears Booker is now within striking distance of meeting his goal. But if he does not hit it, it will be interesting to see if he drops out before the next Democratic debate, for which he has already qualified. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, is eyeing next Friday as a possible date to hold a hearing on the whistleblower complaint. Politico reports: The precise details of that hearing \u2014 including whether it will be public \u2014 depend on whether the committee can schedule an interview with the whistleblower, and if it obtains the full inspector general\u2019s report on the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, previously said the complaint was both urgent and credible. The whistleblower, meanwhile, is awaiting legal guidance from the office of the director of national intelligence regarding what he or she is permitted to tell lawmakers. Mitch McConnell said back in March that, if the House were to impeach Trump, the Senate would immediately hold a trial on whether to remove the president from office. The Senate majority leader said: \u201cIf it were to happen, the Senate has no choice. If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial.\u201d The Kentucky Republican went on to say that he thought impeachment would be politically shortsighted on Democrats\u2019 part, predicting it would energize the GOP base and turn off moderate voters. Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman, has come out in favor of the impeachment inquiry against Trump. Gabbard said she concluded, after reviewing the whistleblower complaint and the president\u2019s comments on the matter, that it would set a \u201cvery dangerous precedent\u201d if an inquiry were not pursued. She added: \u201cSo it is unfortunate, but necessary, that I speak in support of the inquiry into the President\u2019s alleged abuse of power in relation to his interactions with Ukraine\u2019s leaders.\u201d Gabbard had been one of the last remaining holdouts among House Democrats on supporting the inquiry, as a Politico reporter noted last night. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A White House official confirmed the use of a separate system to house important documents with politically sensitive information, including the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The admission could bolster claims of a White House cover-up. Trump has continued to lodge baseless allegations against the whistleblower who first raised concerns about the call, as Joe Biden accused the president of trying to \u201chijack\u201d the 2020 election. The Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, confirmed that his panel intends to hold hearings next week (during a congressional recess) to advance its impeachment investigation. The blog is still covering the latest on impeachment, so stay tuned. Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock explained in an interview with CNN why he considers an impeachment inquiry so necessary, expressing fear that American democracy is \u201cunder siege.\u201d The comment represents a tonal shift for Bullock, who had appeared reluctant about impeachment up until a few days ago. The Montana governor argued in an interview last month that Democrats should focus on more kitchen-table issues. He said: \u201cIn probably 30 different stops, no one asked me about impeachment. What they do talk about is, \u2018Am I going to lose my rural hospital?\u2019 \u201d Today also marks one year since Christine Blasey Ford testified during the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for now-justice Brett Kavanaugh. Despite Ford\u2019s searing testimony, Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was approved by a Senate vote of 50-48 \u2013 the narrowest margin for a confirmation vote since 1881. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris posted an Instagram to mark the anniversary, saying she still believes the sexual assault allegation that Ford came forward with. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has confirmed that his panel intends to hold hearings next week. The House is supposed to go on recess for two weeks after today, but Democrats on the intelligence committee have expressed hope that they will move quickly on next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Schiff said he expected subpoenas and depositions to go out as the committee advances its investigation. Trump and his allies are doing everything they can to discredit the anonymous whistleblower who first raised concerns about the president\u2019s Ukraine call. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said it was even a \u201cstretch\u201d to apply the term whistleblower to the person who filed the complaint. It\u2019s again worth noting that the White House is attempting to discredit the entirety of the complaint by disparaging the whistleblower himself, rather than denying specific aspects of the complaint. For example, the White House could address the claim that Trump officials have repeatedly placed politically sensitive information on a separate server meant for highly classified information or that the president tried to solicit election assistance from a foreign country. But no one from the Trump White House seems to be doing that so far. Joe Biden, who has been generally hesitant to weigh in on the allegations that Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate him, just tweeted a video about the controversy. The video includes a variety of news hosts and commentators emphasizing the gravity of the accusations and fact-checking Trump\u2019s baseless corruption claims about Biden. The tweet echoes what the former vice president told attendees of a California fundraiser last night: \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives. Healthcare, education, the godawful rampant gun violence that\u2019s going on, and maybe the single most important consequential thing is climate change. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to let him do it. This is not about me, this is about the American people and the issues that matter to them.\u201d Democrats on the House intelligence committee appear to be planning to hold hearings over the upcoming two-week congressional recess. Another Democrat on the committee, Mike Quigley of Illinois, said earlier today that he expected key figures in the whistleblower complaint \u2013 including Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and William Barr, the attorney general \u2013 to be called before the panel. House Democratic leaders are distributing talking points to members about how to talk about impeachment with constituents during the upcoming two-week recess. Trump \u201chas reached a grave new level of lawlessness that demands an impeachment inquiry,\u201d one talking point reads. Hillary Clinton is currently speaking at Georgetown University, severely criticizing Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine. The former Democratic presidential candidate said Trump had \u201cendangered us all by putting his personal political interests ahead of the interests of the American people,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports from the event. Clinton warned: \u201cThese are perilous times for our world.\u201d The Democratic National Committee has informed presidential campaigns that the October debate will take place on one night. \u201cTo address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,\u201d the DNC said, per CNN. This decision may come as a surprise to the campaigns, given that 12 candidates have said they have qualified for the debate. It\u2019s possible (although seemingly unlikely) that one or more of those 12 will drop out in the next few weeks, but it will almost certainly be a very crowded debate stage. A senior White House official acknowledged to CNN that the Trump administration has previously used a separate classified system to house important documents, including the transcript of the president\u2019s Ukraine call. The admission could substantiate the whistleblower\u2019s accusation that White House officials quickly moved to conceal details of the Ukraine call by placing it in a codeword system usually reserved for highly classified information. The whistleblower wrote in his complaint of the separate system: \u201cWhite House officials told me that they were \u2018directed\u2019 by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials. \u201cInstead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d The whitlesblower notes in the appendix of the complaint that a White House official said this was \u201cnot the first time\u201d this process took place. To introduce some levity into what will likely be a very serious chapter of American history, the Twitter account for Merriam-Webster Dictionary is trolling the president over his misunderstanding of punctuation. Trump tweeted this complaint about CNN\u2019s coverage hours ago, seemingly confusing a hyphen with an apostrophe. Thankfully, Merriam Webster quickly jumped to the president\u2019s assistance to clear up the matter. It\u2019s not the first time the dictionary has offered its expertise to criticize the president or his allies. After senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway offered up the term \u201calternative facts\u201d to describe Sean Spicer\u2019s false statements about Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd size, Merriam Webster helped her out with the actual definition of a fact. Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat on the House intelligence committee, just told CNN that he expects Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and William Barr, the attorney general, to be called to testify before the panel. The Illinois Democrat also predicted other White House officials would be asked to appear before the committee, where they will likely face questions about whether they participated in or knew of an effort to cover up details of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Members of the House intelligence committee intend to continue their consideration of impeachment during the upcoming two-week recess, with the hope of wrapping up the inquiry this fall. Nancy Pelosi would not specify a timeline this morning when asked about completing the inquiry by the end of the year, saying only that her caucus would \u201cmove with purpose, and expeditiously, but not hastily.\u201d The Kremlin has a request to make of the White House: please don\u2019t release any conversations between Trump and Vladimir Putin. The AP reports: Asked if Moscow is worried that the White House could similarly publish transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \u2018we would like to hope that it wouldn\u2019t come to that in our relations, which are already troubled by a lot of problems.\u2019 Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he emphasized that the publication of the Trump-Zelenskiy call is an internal U.S. issue, but added that it was \u2018quite unusual\u2019 to release a confidential call between leaders. \u2018The materials related to conversations between heads of states are usually classified according to normal international practice,\u2019 he said. The Ukrainian president was reportedly taken aback by the White House including his side of the dialogue in its memo on the two leaders\u2019 July call. His surprise, in turn, surprised many journalists, given that the White House said it was waiting to share information on the call until Ukraine approved its release. In the memo, Zelenskiy is quoted as praising Trump and telling him about his stay at Trump Tower during his last visit to New York. Another important point: the White House has not specified what in the whistleblower complaint it is contradicting. Trump is clearly trying to convince his supporters to reject the complaint wholesale by peddling a baseless claim that the whistleblower made up his sources. But by doing so, Trump is signaling that he knows how potentially devastating the whistleblower\u2019s allegations could be if proven true. Trump\u2019s tweet alleging (without evidence) that the whistleblower fabricated his sources could raise concerns about the president protecting the person\u2019s identity, as a CNBC reporter pointed out. Trump has now jumped from the argument that the whistleblower complaint represented \u201csecondhand information,\u201d as he first argued yesterday, to claiming that the information may have been entirely fabricated. The whistleblower said this in his complaint to explain how he obtained his information: \u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. ... \u201cOver the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort.\u201d A New Yorker writer, who was one target of Trump\u2019s Twitter ire this morning, pointed out that all three major US newspapers included the same word on their front page after the release of the whistleblower complaint: cover-up. The whistleblower alleged that White House officials quickly sought to keep details of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call from being made public by placing documents regarding the conversation in a codeword system. Such a system is usually reserved for highly classified national security data, but the Ukraine call merely represented politically sensitive information. National security experts warned that such an abuse of the sophisticated system could set a dangerous precedent. In Nancy Pelosi\u2019s morning interview with MSNBC, the House speaker said she believed that Trump had left her caucus with \u201cno choice\u201d but to impeach him. Pelosi said: \u201cThis is as serious as it gets when it comes to protecting the Constitution of the United States.\u201d The speaker accused Trump of \u201cjeopardizing national security\u201d and \u201cjeopardizing the integrity of our elections.\u201d Pelosi also reiterated her wish to keep the impeachment inquiry focused on the Ukraine call for now. She said: \u201cI think we have to stay focused as the public is concerned. That the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain. ... \u201cLooking at the material the administration is giving us, they are actually speeding up the process.\u201d Bloomberg News has now obtained footage of Trump\u2019s remarks at a private event with UN staffers yesterday. In it, the president is heard comparing the whistleblower\u2019s sources to a \u201cspy\u201d and saying, \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d Nancy Pelosi said that she believed the attorney general, William Barr, had \u201cgone rogue\u201d in his handling of the whistleblower complaint. The Justice Department chose not to pursue a criminal investigation of Trump after receiving the whistleblower complaint that he had tried to solicit foreign assistance in the 2020 election, a decision that was severely criticized by Democratic lawmakers. The House speaker added that she considered Trump\u2019s comments about the whistleblower and his sources to be \u201cdangerous.\u201d The president said at an event with UN staffers yesterday that he wanted to know who talked to the whistleblower and appeared to joke about executing those officials. Trump is now demanding over Twitter that Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, resign over his opening statement at yesterday\u2019s hearing. In his opening statement, Schiff parodied the White House memo on Trump\u2019s conversation with the president of Ukraine to emphasize his argument that the commander-in-chief was acting like a mob boss. Republican lawmakers accused Schiff of falsely quoting the memo, even though the document itself is not a verbatim transcript of the call. It seemed quite clear that Schiff was trying to make a point, not quoting from a specific text. The video is below to make your own call. Good morning, live blog readers! Well, Donald Trump is back on Twitter and trying to shout down concerns that he tried to solicit foreign assistance in the 2020 election, even as the impeachment inquiry against him advances at a rapid clip. The president specifically took aim at Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, and a New York Times reporter who covers his White House. But it\u2019s clear that this scandal over whether Trump tried to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is not going to go away easily. Biden himself has been hesitant to directly weigh in on the controversy, but in comments at a fundraiser last night, he accused Trump of trying to \u201chijack\u201d the election. Biden said: \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives. Healthcare, education, the godawful rampant gun violence that\u2019s going on, and maybe the single most important consequential thing is climate change. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to let him do it. This is not about me, this is about the American people and the issues that matter to them.\u201d But with so much attention turned to the potentially history-making events unfolding on Capitol Hill, it will be hard to keep a focus on the issues of the 2020 race. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will participate in a High Holy Days call with Jewish leaders and later speak at the White House\u2019s Hispanic Heritage Month celebration, which could prove interesting given the president\u2019s past racist remarks about Latino immigrants. This is Congress\u2019 last day in session before a two-week recess. Biden is campaigning in Las Vegas, Nevada. The blog will have more on all of that, so stay tuned.",

De Niro is Frank Sheeran, a second world war veteran whose ensuing career as a truck driver belied his cold-blooded ability to kill with little remorse. But he soon found his way into a life of crime, first with a bit of light theft and ultimately as an efficient killer, working for mob boss Russell Bufalino (Pesci).

It\u2019s obviously fitting that a reunion with his longtime collaborator would do the trick and it\u2019s a joy to see him cruising at the top of his game again, curbing his parodied excesses and effortlessly steering the film through decades.

He\u2019s rational and professional, much like the film\u2019s plot, which eschews the brash debauchery of Goodfellas or Casino for something far more grounded. There\u2019s humour, plenty of it, but rather than watching men commit crimes to pay for extravagant luxuries, we see them do it for their family\u2019s survival, or at least that\u2019s how they might justify it.</p> <p>And it\u2019s in this introspection where the film gets <em>really </em>interesting. When a director returns to a genre they\u2019re most associated with, it can often feel like a greatest hits montage. For much of its duration, The Irishman covers familiar ground but is slickly entertaining, if a little repetitive in the third hour. In the last 30 minutes, as the pace slows and the quips subside and the violence quells, we are suddenly made aware of the ultimate price of this lifestyle and of the crushing savagery of old age. It\u2019s a finale of stifling bleakness, of the pathetic emptiness of crime and of men who mistake their priorities in life, the discovery arriving all too late. There\u2019s an almost meta-maturity, as if Scorsese is also looking back on his own career, the film leaving us with a haunting reminder not to glamorise violent men and the wreckage they leave behind.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Irishman is showing at the New York film festival and will be released theatrically on 1 November with a Netflix release on 27 November</p></li> </ul>",

The film\u2019s ace is a quietly electrifying Pesci, in his first role since 2010, an astounding reminder of his big screen presence with a character so dramatically distant from his previous Scorsese incarnations. He\u2019s rational and professional, much like the film\u2019s plot, which eschews the brash debauchery of Goodfellas or Casino for something far more grounded. There\u2019s humour, plenty of it, but rather than watching men commit crimes to pay for extravagant luxuries, we see them do it for their family\u2019s survival, or at least that\u2019s how they might justify it. And it\u2019s in this introspection where the film gets really interesting. When a director returns to a genre they\u2019re most associated with, it can often feel like a greatest hits montage. For much of its duration, The Irishman covers familiar ground but is slickly entertaining, if a little repetitive in the third hour. In the last 30 minutes, as the pace slows and the quips subside and the violence quells, we are suddenly made aware of the ultimate price of this lifestyle and of the crushing savagery of old age. It\u2019s a finale of stifling bleakness, of the pathetic emptiness of crime and of men who mistake their priorities in life, the discovery arriving all too late. There\u2019s an almost meta-maturity, as if Scorsese is also looking back on his own career, the film leaving us with a haunting reminder not to glamorise violent men and the wreckage they leave behind. The Irishman is showing at the New York film festival and will be released theatrically on 1 November with a Netflix release on 27 November",
