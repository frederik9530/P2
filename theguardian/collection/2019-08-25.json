Responsibility for funding free TV licences for the over-75s, which costs an estimated \u00a3750m a year, is being handed over to the BBC in June next year, under a deal struck with David Cameron\u2019s government in 2015. Theresa May repeatedly urged the BBC to continue funding the benefit but the broadcaster announced in June that most over-75s would have to pay for a licence, with only the poorest protected. In the 2017 general election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to maintain pensioner benefits, \u201cincluding free bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this parliament\u201d.

It is a matter for the government if it wishes to restore funding for free licences for all over-75s.\u201d The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said: \u201cThis prime minister\u2019s disregard for older people is appalling. He is trying to blame the BBC for his own government\u2019s policy, but this obfuscation will not work. The blame for scrapping free TV licences lies firmly with the government.\u201d Research from the House of Commons library found that 3m households would lose their free TV licences as a result of the decision. The BBC has said it will continue to provide licences to over-75s who can provide evidence that they claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people. A No 10 source said: \u201cThe government agreed the licence fee settlement with the BBC in 2015. At the time, the director general said it was a \u2018strong deal for the BBC\u2019 and provided \u2018financial stability\u2019. \u201cIt saw BBC income boosted by requiring iPlayer users to have a licence, and unfroze the licence fee for the first time since 2010 \u2013 with it rising each year with inflation. In return, we agreed responsibility for the over-75 concession would transfer to the BBC in June 2020. The BBC must honour this agreement.\u201d",

Insisting you lead that emergency government will therefore jeopardise the chances of a no confidence vote gaining enough support to pass in the first place,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>The former chancellor Philip Hammond revealed the extent of the bad blood between Downing Street and Conservative moderates on Sunday, as he wrote to the PM <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/25/hammond-demands-apology-over-claims-he-leaked-brexit-dossier\">demanding an apology</a> for briefings that suggested the Yellowhammer leak came from former ministers.</p> <p>Hammond said it had since emerged the document was dated to August, and thus could not have been leaked by one of the moderates dispatched to the backbenches in Johnson\u2019s summer reshuffle.</p> <p>A government official said Johnson would respond, \u201cin due course\u201d.</p> <p>On Sunday, Johnson claimed the Brexit mood music had improved significantly over recent days; but it remained \u201ctouch and go\u201d whether a deal was achievable.</p> <p>Throughout the summit in Biarritz, Johnson has sought to stress the UK\u2019s determination to remain internationalist \u2013 and to distance itself from Trump\u2019s White House on some questions.</p> <p>At a dinner of G7 leaders on Saturday night, which sources said was occasionally testy, Johnson sided with Germany, France and others against the US president\u2019s argument that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/25/g7-trumps-demands-for-russias-readmission-causes-row-in-biarritz\">Russia should be readmitted to the group</a>.</p>",

Johnson is battling to keep alive the prospect of striking a reworked exit deal with the EU27 in time for Britain to leave by the Halloween deadline, which he has made it a \u201cmission\u201d of his government to meet. But with just a week until MPs return to Westminster, preparing to seize any opportunity to bind his hands, Johnson has so far presented no detailed plan. After Johnson met Tusk on the sidelines of the G7 summit on Sunday, an EU official said, \u201cnothing really happened\u201d. \u201cIt was essentially just a reconfirmation of of the views of both sides. There were no new substantive elements from any side, and obviously not from the UK side,\u201d the official said. \u201cWhat we ideally would have been hoping for and looking for are new ideas that unblock this situation,\u201d the European official said. \u201cSo we are waiting \u2026 We need input from their side.\u201d Meanwhile, it emerged this weekend that Downing Street has sought legal advice from the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, about the possibility of shutting down parliament from September. Asked about the issue on Sunday, a senior government official said, \u201cNo 10 commissions legal advice on a whole range of issues, but the PM is clear that he is not going to stop MPs debating Brexit\u201d. Johnson\u2019s parliamentary opponents appear unable to present a united front, however. The shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, accused the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, of being \u201cextremely petulant\u201d on Sunday, after she raised doubts about whether Jeremy Corbyn was the right person to lead a caretaker government to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Gardiner told Sky News that the Labour leader was offering a \u201cfailsafe\u201d way of achieving the Lib Dems\u2019 Brexit aims, but he said Swinson had concluded, \u201coh well, we are not going to cooperate if Jeremy Corbyn is going to be the person who does it\u201d. Labour has suggested it could table a vote of no confidence in Johnson\u2019s government \u2013 but is unlikely to do so immediately after MPs return from summer recess unless it is convinced Tory rebels are ready to back it. Swinson has written to Corbyn, suggesting an agenda for the meeting and warning that if he insists on leading the charge it could prevent the plan succeeding. \u201cIn the last week, many MPs who stand opposed to no deal, in particular key Conservative MPs, have rejected your proposal to lead an emergency government. Insisting you lead that emergency government will therefore jeopardise the chances of a no confidence vote gaining enough support to pass in the first place,\u201d she wrote. The former chancellor Philip Hammond revealed the extent of the bad blood between Downing Street and Conservative moderates on Sunday, as he wrote to the PM demanding an apology for briefings that suggested the Yellowhammer leak came from former ministers. Hammond said it had since emerged the document was dated to August, and thus could not have been leaked by one of the moderates dispatched to the backbenches in Johnson\u2019s summer reshuffle. A government official said Johnson would respond, \u201cin due course\u201d. On Sunday, Johnson claimed the Brexit mood music had improved significantly over recent days; but it remained \u201ctouch and go\u201d whether a deal was achievable. Throughout the summit in Biarritz, Johnson has sought to stress the UK\u2019s determination to remain internationalist \u2013 and to distance itself from Trump\u2019s White House on some questions. At a dinner of G7 leaders on Saturday night, which sources said was occasionally testy, Johnson sided with Germany, France and others against the US president\u2019s argument that Russia should be readmitted to the group.",

In 2017 he was told to run the UK trials while still recovering from a hamstring injury \u2013 and then was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/11/adam-gemili-misses-out-team-gb-world-championships-athletics\" title=\"\">snubbed by selectors</a> for the 100m and 200m for the subsequent world championships and chosen for the relay only.

He predicted he was capable of running much faster at next month\u2019s world championships in Doha, where he will double up over 100m and 200m.</p> <p>\u201cGoing into the Rio Olympics, no one expected me to make the final,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew what I was capable of and I just missed out on an Olympic medal by three thousandths of a second. Hopefully going into Doha I can be pushing for that gold medal, which is the aim.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Hughes revealed afterwards that he had been struggling with a niggle in his right hamstring which had affected him in the race. \u201cI was feeling some tightness, so I needed needles in my hamstring. But my mind was just focused in order to make the team. I\u2019m happy that I got the silver medal.\u201d He was confident he would be fine for Doha. \u201cDo not worry, trust me. I\u2019ll be in a great mental space and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be OK physically.\u201d</p> <p>In the women\u2019s 200m Jodie Williams showed she was heading back to her best by winning in 23.06sec into a -4.3m/s headwind, while Shelayna Oskan-Clarke was also impressive in holding off Lynsey Sharp to win the 800m in 2min 02.68sec.</p> <p>One of the more extraordinary performances of the day came from Eilish McColgan, who powered away from the gun to win the women\u2019s 5,000m by around 100m from Jessica Judd. McColgan was already 50m clear after two laps of the race and continued to extend her lead before winning in 15min 21.38sec.</p> <p>Elsewhere Matthew Hudson-Smith qualified for next month\u2019s world championships despite missing most of the season by winning the men\u2019s 400m in 45.15 sec while Holly Bradshaw took her seventh UK pole vault title with a British championship record 4.73m.</p>",

In 2017 he was told to run the UK trials while still recovering from a hamstring injury \u2013 and then was snubbed by selectors for the 100m and 200m for the subsequent world championships and chosen for the relay only. Gemili\u2019s response was typical of the man. Rather than rant about it he knuckled down and ran a storming leg as Britain beat the US and Jamaica to win world 4x100m gold in front of a capacity crowd in London. \u201cTo be labelled a relay runner is never nice, especially in an individual sport,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this proves to those guys it doesn\u2019t matter how injured you are, there\u2019s always light at the end of the tunnel and you can come and run fast.\u201d Gemili, who has been training with the Olympic 200m silver medallist Andre De Grasse, said he was now over his injury issues and had been able to put in a full winter\u2019s training in Florida. He predicted he was capable of running much faster at next month\u2019s world championships in Doha, where he will double up over 100m and 200m. \u201cGoing into the Rio Olympics, no one expected me to make the final,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew what I was capable of and I just missed out on an Olympic medal by three thousandths of a second. Hopefully going into Doha I can be pushing for that gold medal, which is the aim.\u201d Meanwhile Hughes revealed afterwards that he had been struggling with a niggle in his right hamstring which had affected him in the race. \u201cI was feeling some tightness, so I needed needles in my hamstring. But my mind was just focused in order to make the team. I\u2019m happy that I got the silver medal.\u201d He was confident he would be fine for Doha. \u201cDo not worry, trust me. I\u2019ll be in a great mental space and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be OK physically.\u201d In the women\u2019s 200m Jodie Williams showed she was heading back to her best by winning in 23.06sec into a -4.3m/s headwind, while Shelayna Oskan-Clarke was also impressive in holding off Lynsey Sharp to win the 800m in 2min 02.68sec. One of the more extraordinary performances of the day came from Eilish McColgan, who powered away from the gun to win the women\u2019s 5,000m by around 100m from Jessica Judd. McColgan was already 50m clear after two laps of the race and continued to extend her lead before winning in 15min 21.38sec. Elsewhere Matthew Hudson-Smith qualified for next month\u2019s world championships despite missing most of the season by winning the men\u2019s 400m in 45.15 sec while Holly Bradshaw took her seventh UK pole vault title with a British championship record 4.73m.",

      "body": "<p>Hello everyone and welcome back. I think it\u2019s fair to say that a Bafta, a move to BBC One and an absence of almost two years hasn\u2019t made Tommy Shelby\u2019s heart grow any less cold, his brain any less busy or his emotional state any less troubled.</p> \n<p>Steven Knight has always been particularly good at beginnings and this ferociously paced opening episode was one of his best yet. It set a number of storylines in play, from the effect of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 on the gang\u2019s legitimate business to Tommy\u2019s attempts to build a political career as a man of the people-style politician. It also threw in a reminder in the brutal closing moments that the middle Shelby brother remains a killer at heart, albeit one who is no longer quite so impervious to the aftermath of his decisions.</p> \n<h2><strong>Our </strong><strong>heroes</strong></h2> \n<p>While Tommy contented himself with knocking back his little bottle of dope and communing with the lilting shade of his dead wife (\u201cAh Grace \u2026 just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb_T9qPdzlM)\">indeed</a>) the episode\u2019s most welcome news was that Polly, whom we first glimpse having the time of her life in Monte Carlo, has very much got her mojo back.</p> \n<p>That is good news both for the Shelby clan and for the show itself. A depressed and off-her-game Polly is never quite as much fun as a bold and bolshy Polly threatening to careen gloriously off the rails while making random predictions of golden futures to come.</p> \n<p>Nor was Polly the only Shelby woman getting her time in the spotlight as Knight appeared to address some of the criticisms regarding female characters in the last season. Certainly, it will be interesting to see what happens with Ada\u2019s pregnancy (and the revelation that she\u2019s been sleeping with, as well as informing for, Tommy\u2019s former commanding officer Col Ben Younger) while Linda\u2019s continued fall from grace, growing cocaine habit and apparently unstoppable ambition for Arthur remains one of the show\u2019s most interesting strands. If they would only give the excellent Natasha O\u2019Keeffe, who plays Lizzie, more to do than look lovely and sigh sadly, then I would be truly thrilled. Then again, the lot of Tommy\u2019s women is never a happy one, so perhaps Lizzie is doing the right thing by largely skulking out of sight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"160e740d90889ac785173335bb9d6beb0f215e63\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/160e740d90889ac785173335bb9d6beb0f215e63/0_185_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polly: thankfully, for the Shelby\u2019s and the show, she has her mojo back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polly: thankfully, for the Shelby\u2019s and the show, she has her mojo back.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If the women were greeting the approach of a new decade with reinvigorated purpose, the same could not be said of the show\u2019s men. From Tommy\u2019s repeated insistence that no one from little Charlie to the members of the Shelby board were listening to him, to Arthur\u2019s struggle to be chairman in anything but name, there was a definite sense that this is one of those seasons where things are starting badly and can only get worse \u2013 and that\u2019s before we even get to the problems caused by the two youngest members of the family.</p> \n<p>While Shelby baby Finn tried to prove himself a man, and got a (thankfully not fatal) bullet for his pains, the night\u2019s biggest loser was Michael, who appears to have taken his move to New York as a licence to indulge in all the girls, guns and gak he can possibly muster. Unfortunately, this hedonistic lifestyle meant that he ignored Tommy\u2019s tip regarding the crash and lost the Shelby money. Does a Fredo Corleone style fate awake him or will his mummy ride cigarillo in hand to his rescue once again?</p> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>bad </strong><strong>guys</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"763f04fb25bfde2546d0396b8aa3928323fc4bbf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/763f04fb25bfde2546d0396b8aa3928323fc4bbf/0_204_2856_3570/800.jpg\" alt=\"Suave and slimy: Sam Claflin as Oswald Mosley.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suave and slimy: Sam Claflin as Oswald Mosley.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The labyrinthine plotting on this show means that it is unlikely we have met all of this season\u2019s main antagonists \u2013 although I do wonder if Tommy might come to regret both his harsh words to the judge and sending the Peaky Blinders in to stir things up in Chinatown \u2013 but we did get a short introduction to rising Labour MP Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin doing suave and slimy very well). Given that most of Tommy\u2019s enemies prefer brute force to sharp words, it will be interesting to see how he deals with Mosley, a man who clearly knows his way round parliament and who hides his thuggery beneath that flashy smile.</p> \n<h2><strong>Notes from the </strong><strong>boardroom</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Alas poor Mr Levitt, late of the Times. It\u2019s never easy trying to speak truth to power and particularly not as a member of the press. Although it did seem a little belt and braces to have him shot after terrifying him with the whole blackmail thing.</p></li> \n <li><p>So we called it right last season: Aberama Gold is working with (or should that be for) the Peaky Blinders right now. He\u2019s no Alfie Solomons, but the mutual distrust should still be fun.</p></li> \n <li><p>Michael\u2019s gangster\u2019s moll of a girlfriend is clearly going to cause all manner of problems in Small Heath. I\u2019m particularly keen to see Polly\u2019s reaction to her blue-eyed boy\u2019s new flame.</p></li> \n <li><p>I enjoyed Linda\u2019s attempts to bring both feminism and sarcasm to the boardroom. That said no one does withering looks of great scorn as well as Helen McCrory.</p></li> \n <li><p>I know Ada has abandoned her communist ideals but I will still be very unhappy if she doesn\u2019t call her new baby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/germans-take-to-the-streets-to-celebrate-rosa-luxemburg-karl-liebknecht-berlin\">Rosa</a>.</p></li> \n <li><p>I\u2019m increasingly fond of Frances, the incredibly stoic housekeeper. Long may she reign over Tommy\u2019s affairs.</p></li> \n <li><p>Peaky Blinders can call the area where Tommy mournfully rode his horse across to contact Arthur the Lickey Hills as much as they want \u2013 I know Saddleworth Moor when I see it.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week</strong></h2> \n<p>While Anna Calvi\u2019s soundtrack helped everything hang together and there was a nice use of Black Strobe\u2019s I\u2019m A Man, this can only go to one song. It might have taken them five seasons but Peaky Blinders finally paid homage to the Black Country\u2019s finest as <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3JvMig6Sc8XRLqHseNsccM\">Black Sabbath\u2019s The Wizard</a> played the gang into the Garrison.</p> \n<h2><strong>Quote of the </strong><strong>week</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cI once took a bullet from between two ribs, one inch from the heart. Mind you, it was a horse and the horse did die.\u201d It\u2019s the way Aberama Gold tells them you know \u2026</p> \n<p><em>So what did you think? Welcome return or a busted flush?

      "bodyText": "Hello everyone and welcome back. I think it\u2019s fair to say that a Bafta, a move to BBC One and an absence of almost two years hasn\u2019t made Tommy Shelby\u2019s heart grow any less cold, his brain any less busy or his emotional state any less troubled. Steven Knight has always been particularly good at beginnings and this ferociously paced opening episode was one of his best yet. It set a number of storylines in play, from the effect of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 on the gang\u2019s legitimate business to Tommy\u2019s attempts to build a political career as a man of the people-style politician. It also threw in a reminder in the brutal closing moments that the middle Shelby brother remains a killer at heart, albeit one who is no longer quite so impervious to the aftermath of his decisions. Our heroes While Tommy contented himself with knocking back his little bottle of dope and communing with the lilting shade of his dead wife (\u201cAh Grace \u2026 just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger,\u201d indeed) the episode\u2019s most welcome news was that Polly, whom we first glimpse having the time of her life in Monte Carlo, has very much got her mojo back. That is good news both for the Shelby clan and for the show itself. A depressed and off-her-game Polly is never quite as much fun as a bold and bolshy Polly threatening to careen gloriously off the rails while making random predictions of golden futures to come. Nor was Polly the only Shelby woman getting her time in the spotlight as Knight appeared to address some of the criticisms regarding female characters in the last season. Certainly, it will be interesting to see what happens with Ada\u2019s pregnancy (and the revelation that she\u2019s been sleeping with, as well as informing for, Tommy\u2019s former commanding officer Col Ben Younger) while Linda\u2019s continued fall from grace, growing cocaine habit and apparently unstoppable ambition for Arthur remains one of the show\u2019s most interesting strands. If they would only give the excellent Natasha O\u2019Keeffe, who plays Lizzie, more to do than look lovely and sigh sadly, then I would be truly thrilled. Then again, the lot of Tommy\u2019s women is never a happy one, so perhaps Lizzie is doing the right thing by largely skulking out of sight. If the women were greeting the approach of a new decade with reinvigorated purpose, the same could not be said of the show\u2019s men. From Tommy\u2019s repeated insistence that no one from little Charlie to the members of the Shelby board were listening to him, to Arthur\u2019s struggle to be chairman in anything but name, there was a definite sense that this is one of those seasons where things are starting badly and can only get worse \u2013 and that\u2019s before we even get to the problems caused by the two youngest members of the family. While Shelby baby Finn tried to prove himself a man, and got a (thankfully not fatal) bullet for his pains, the night\u2019s biggest loser was Michael, who appears to have taken his move to New York as a licence to indulge in all the girls, guns and gak he can possibly muster. Unfortunately, this hedonistic lifestyle meant that he ignored Tommy\u2019s tip regarding the crash and lost the Shelby money. Does a Fredo Corleone style fate awake him or will his mummy ride cigarillo in hand to his rescue once again? The bad guys The labyrinthine plotting on this show means that it is unlikely we have met all of this season\u2019s main antagonists \u2013 although I do wonder if Tommy might come to regret both his harsh words to the judge and sending the Peaky Blinders in to stir things up in Chinatown \u2013 but we did get a short introduction to rising Labour MP Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin doing suave and slimy very well). Given that most of Tommy\u2019s enemies prefer brute force to sharp words, it will be interesting to see how he deals with Mosley, a man who clearly knows his way round parliament and who hides his thuggery beneath that flashy smile. Notes from the boardroom Alas poor Mr Levitt, late of the Times. It\u2019s never easy trying to speak truth to power and particularly not as a member of the press. Although it did seem a little belt and braces to have him shot after terrifying him with the whole blackmail thing. So we called it right last season: Aberama Gold is working with (or should that be for) the Peaky Blinders right now. He\u2019s no Alfie Solomons, but the mutual distrust should still be fun. Michael\u2019s gangster\u2019s moll of a girlfriend is clearly going to cause all manner of problems in Small Heath. I\u2019m particularly keen to see Polly\u2019s reaction to her blue-eyed boy\u2019s new flame. I enjoyed Linda\u2019s attempts to bring both feminism and sarcasm to the boardroom. That said no one does withering looks of great scorn as well as Helen McCrory. I know Ada has abandoned her communist ideals but I will still be very unhappy if she doesn\u2019t call her new baby Rosa. I\u2019m increasingly fond of Frances, the incredibly stoic housekeeper. Long may she reign over Tommy\u2019s affairs. Peaky Blinders can call the area where Tommy mournfully rode his horse across to contact Arthur the Lickey Hills as much as they want \u2013 I know Saddleworth Moor when I see it. Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week While Anna Calvi\u2019s soundtrack helped everything hang together and there was a nice use of Black Strobe\u2019s I\u2019m A Man, this can only go to one song. It might have taken them five seasons but Peaky Blinders finally paid homage to the Black Country\u2019s finest as Black Sabbath\u2019s The Wizard played the gang into the Garrison. Quote of the week \u201cI once took a bullet from between two ribs, one inch from the heart. Mind you, it was a horse and the horse did die.\u201d It\u2019s the way Aberama Gold tells them you know \u2026 So what did you think? Welcome return or a busted flush? With trouble in the air can Tommy keep the family together? Will Michael miraculously make it through another season? And if you were Ada, which famous dead revolutionary would you name your unborn child after? As always all speculation and no spoilers welcome below \u2026",

Did Commander Lawrence realise how far things would go when he forced June to learn how to choose between lives, weighing some as more valuable than others?</p> <p>We may have cheered June on when she killed the thoroughly villainous Commander Winslow in self-defence, but standing by and allowing Eleanor Lawrence to die from an overdose was another level of crime altogether. Perhaps June thought she was simply carrying out Eleanor\u2019s wishes \u2013 after all, as Eleanor pointed out this week, there is no escape from Gilead for her and Lawrence, even if they make it across the border. But it is far more likely that June allowed her to die because she was simply too much of a risk to their escape plan in her unmedicated state. She was, as the episode\u2019s title suggests, the sacrifice needed to save those children \u2013 in June\u2019s mind, at least.</p> <p>Julie Dretzin has been brilliant as Eleanor, but in recent episodes the character has morphed into a cliched mad truth-teller, as confused or as wise as each scene required her to be. Her suicide, though, was completely consistent with the character, and bleakly inevitable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/03/when-good-tv-goes-bad-west-wing\">Bradley Whitford</a> was great, too, as the grieving husband mechanically going through with June\u2019s plan, while perhaps beginning to suspect that it is no coincidence that his wife died while June was under his roof.

      "body": "<p>It is a truth recently acknowledged that Andrew Davies, grandfather of the sexed-up British period drama, used all the existing material from Jane Austen\u2019s final novel in the first half hour of his adaptation of Sanditon (ITV). This \u2013 the one most of us haven\u2019t read, and which has never before been adapted for the screen \u2013 is the fragment Austen abandoned unfinished in March 1817. She died four months later, leaving behind 11 chapters of a strange fiction about encroaching modernity in the industrial age and, more specifically, a seaside resort on the Sussex coast.</p> <p>So for once we slip into the ease and comfort of a Sunday night period drama knowing precisely where the author\u2019s words end and the adaptor\u2019s imagination takes flight. Say 24 minutes in, as our lively and naive heroine Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams) admires a pair of slippers in a shop window. What happens after this takes place in Davies\u2019s Sanditon, not Austen\u2019s. Really, though, will it come as a surprise to hear that the swoonsome arrival of Sidney Parker (Downton Abbey\u2019s Theo James) storming up the blowy cliffside in a coach bears the naughty mark of Davies? Or the deer-spotting that turns out to be the bounder Sir Edward Denham rutting with a girl of whom he is ruthlessly taking advantage? Or the requisite ball filled with snatched power-play betwixt claps and curtseys? Of course not! Austen switched places with Davies a quarter of a century ago, approximately 44 minutes into episode four of Pride and Prejudice when Colin Firth emerged wet-shirted from a lake. I still remember, a decade later, reading a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/jan/02/lastnightstvsenseandsensi\">hilarious Nancy Banks-Smith review</a> of his (also sexy-seasidey) Sense and Sensibility, which observed that Davies\u2019s name was in larger type than Austen\u2019s in the opening credits.</p> <p>As for his Sanditon, it\u2019s good dirty end-of-the-pier fun but about as enduring as an ice-cream cone. It begins, as all period dramas ought to, with a coach accident. This is what\u2019s required for a group of people who would never otherwise meet to be thrown together. In this case Tom and Mary Parker, tunnel-visioned entrepreneurs determined to transform the sleepy fishing village of Sanditon into a modern seaside resort. And the Heywoods, traditional country folk who make it their principle \u201cnever to go more than five miles from home\u201d. Mr Parker shows the Heywoods his plans for the hotel, shops, terraces, cliff walk, and assembly rooms where, the following week, Sir Andrew Davies (sorry, he) will be throwing Sanditon\u2019s first ball. Charlotte wants to go, especially when her father warns her \u201cthese seaside resorts can be odd places\u201d. Anyone who knows their way round the topography of an Austen novel will hear the ringing of alarm bells (which she was much more into than wedding bells). It was from Brighton, after all, that Lydia Bennet<em><strong> </strong></em>eloped with George Wickham. \u201cI think you\u2019ll come to regret ever setting foot in Sanditon,\u201d warns Esther Denham, who is so dodgy she\u2019s the only one dressed in black at the ball.</p> <p>The seaside may be morally lax but that makes it the ideal location for Davies\u2019s thematic concerns: all bonnet-teasing winds, wildly metaphorical seas, and the opportunity for people to get their kit off. Which the men do, racing for the water bare-bummed, free, and terribly English. This is Davies\u2019s 2019 update: to redress the gender balance by undressing the men. The women, meanwhile, retire to bathing machines where they struggle into red caps and bathing smocks that look like they\u2019ve come off the set of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and then get rolled into the sea. None of this stops Sir Edward Denham purring to Charlotte of \u201cthe ocean bearing itself up as you give yourself to it freely\u201d or \u201cthe gentle play of the currents over your naked limbs\u201d. This comes in the first half hour, incidentally, but I\u2019d wager not from Austen\u2019s pen.</p> <p>The rest is exactly as you feel it will be in your waters. Every box is ticked off to great satisfaction or dull predictability depending on where you stand on the period drama tolerance scale. The top-notch ensemble cast including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/anne-reid-kaleidoscope-dinnerladies-coronation-street\">Anne Reid</a> as Lady Denham, the curmudgeonly grande dame presiding over a fortune that her relatives are desperate to get their hands on. The stunning locations, all craggy clifftops and Regency elegance, and similarly chiselled and reserved hero. The problem is, in an era of period dramas with extraordinarily high production values such as The Crown, or exquisitely written and envelope-pushing ones such as Gentleman Jack, Sanditon looks a little tired and conventional. Dare I say it of an Andrew Davies Austen adaptation? It\u2019s not very sexy.</p> <p>And another thing \u2026 stumbled upon Jamie Oliver: The Naked Chef Bares All (C4) and although it was a sycophantic tribute dressed up as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/21/tv-tonight-bbc-four-bauhaus-100\">a documentary</a> it also made me realise \u2026 I kind of love him.</p>",

Dare I say it of an Andrew Davies Austen adaptation? It\u2019s not very sexy. And another thing \u2026 stumbled upon Jamie Oliver: The Naked Chef Bares All (C4) and although it was a sycophantic tribute dressed up as a documentary it also made me realise \u2026 I kind of love him.",

Betis are no mugs \u2013 they finished 10th last season \u2013 but defeat to Real Valladolid hardly set the pulses racing and leaves them with an unenviable task in Catalonia. In terms of team news, Messi is not part of the 18-man squad owing to a pesky calf injury despite returning to first-team training, which is a crying shame.

      "bodyText": "Here is the match report ... The champions have their first La Liga win of the season. An evening that began most uncomfortably ended convincingly, with Antoine Griezmann scoring twice \u2013 and showering himself in a dollop of blaugrana confetti in celebration \u2013 before goals from Arturo Vidal and Jordi Alba, while Ansu Fati, a late substitute at Camp Nou, became the second-youngest Barcelona player in history at 16 years and 298 days old. Betis scored two wonderful but worthless goals, with Nabil Fekir opening the scoring with a peach before Loren\u2019s consolation, a belting strike from distance. All in all, seven goals and plenty of fun for the neutral. 90+1 min: Fati slides the ball across the box for Griezmann \u2013 but the France forward cannot divert the ball home. He\u2019s trying ... 90 min: William Carvalho is booked for tugging at Sergi Roberto\u2019s shirt. That\u2019s the closest he has got to any Barcelona midfielder this half. There will be three added minutes at Camp Nou. 89 min: Pedraza proves a killjoy, hauling down Fati \u2013 supposedly fairly \u2013 just as the teenager set himself to pull the trigger inside the box. A wry smile by Fati says it all. He saw the headlines. 85 min: Ansu Fati drills just wide of a post! The 16-year-old, a breath of fresh air down the right flank, has been fearless since coming on and very nearly scored a fairytale goal on debut. The forward does not turn 17 until October. 82 min: Griezmann is sniffing around for his hat-trick, with Nelson Semedo almost teeing up the forward inside the box; you wouldn\u2019t put it past him. The Barcelona right-back has had a very rewarding evening marauding up and down the flank. A belting goal by Loren \u2013 but surely only a consolation. Barcelona get sloppy, with Griezmann\u2019s misplaced pass landing at the feet of Loren, who emphatically rattles the ball beyond Ter Stegen. A ludicrous finish. Just the seven goals and counting, then. 78 min: Barcelona\u2019s fifth goal prompts Ansu Fati\u2019s arrival, with the 16-year-old replacing Carles P\u00e9rez. At 16 years and 298 days, the Guinea-Bissau born forward become the second-youngest player in the club\u2019s history. What were you doing when you were 16? Fati, who looks over the moon, is on for his debut. A crisp pass by Griezmann and a thumping strike by the substitute. Barcelona poured forward at speed, with Arturo Vidal putting the icing on the cake after an unselfish ball across the box by the Frenchman. An unforgiving finish. An evening that started so promisingly for Real Betis is unravelling at the seams. 75 min: Rubi makes his third and final Betis change, as Sergio Canales is replaced by Diego Lainez. Down on the touchline, Valverde is preparing a substitution of his own with the 16-year-old Ansu Fati stripped and ready for action. 73 min: Valverde is taking no risks. The Barcelona manager senses Busquets is not right and on comes Arturo Vidal in his place. De Jong switches into a deeper role. 72 min: Busquets is first on the scene to prevent Joaqu\u00edn from twirling on halfway but the Spain midfielder ends up taking a knock himself in the process. Busquets cradles his shin but he is fine to carry on soldering away. Betis are in danger of suffering an almightily slow death unless they can halt Barcelona. 70 min: Barcelona are well and truly cruising. 65 min: Loren looks to go it alone but Gerard Piqu\u00e9 grinds through the gears and strides across to intercept. Ter Stegen then makes a poor clearance to plunge Barcelona back into trouble but the hosts get away with. Amid the goal rush, Betis have introduced Kaptoum and Joaqu\u00edn in place of Guardado and Tello. 62 min: Is a three-goal cushion sufficient enough for Valverde to consider throwing on the 16-year-old Ansu Fati? Barcelona are suddenly cruising. Betis have gone to pieces. The flying full-back rolls in a fourth. Sergio Busquets slips in the Spaniard down the left flank and Jordi Alba cannot believe how much space he has and simply prods across goal. Barcelona have turned this game on its head in a flash. The youngster scores on his full La Liga debut. The 21-year-old has kept plugging away and when the ball is worked to him via Semedo just inside the edge of the box, an immaculate first touch allows him to open his body up and side-foot the ball into the corner of the Betis goal. A deserved goal, and some breathing space for Bar\u00e7a. They may not quite be firing on all cylinders but, contrary to Ernesto Valverde\u2019s body language, his side are really in the mood. 54 min: Carles P\u00e9rez steps inside and sends a rasping strike against the side netting. Barcelona, with their tails up, are beginning to strut their stuff. Betis look a little overwhelmed about it all. 52 min: A bit of razzmatazz from Griezmann, in more ways than one. That is one way to announce yourself in Catalonia. And it\u2019s a beauty. The Frenchman nonchalantly bends the ball into the far corner beyond Mart\u00edn in the Betis goal. He then proceeds towards the corner flag and picks up some blue and red confetti and promptly showers it over himself. A tacky \u2013 and surely rehearsed \u2013 celebration but that was a stunning, curled finish after Sergi Roberto nudged the ball into his path. Griezmann jinked on to his left foot and the rest is history. In the stand, Messi is all smiles. 48 min: Griezmann is penalised for a foul on Fekir. 47 min: A blistering start to this second period by Barcelona, with Rafinha dropping a shoulder and drifting inside before Griezmann takes over. Then, he unselfishly spreads the ball wide to Carles P\u00e9rez but the winger gets it all wrong on his (weaker) right foot. Ernesto Valverde\u2019s resulting frown is a picture. 46 min: Betis get the second half started at Camp Nou. The France trio Griezmann, Fekir and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who has to make do with watching this one from the swanky seats, enjoyed a little chinwag in the tunnel at at the interval. Antoine Griezmann\u2019s first Barcelona goal cancelled out a fine Nabil Fekir strike. Bar\u00e7a have not been spectacular but should probably be ahead, with Rafinha spurning a couple of golden opportunities. 45 min: There will be one added minute. 43 min: Barcelona should lead but Rafinha squanders another big chance, with the Brazilian somehow failing to prod Carles P\u00e9rez\u2019s cross home from a yard or two out. To make matters worse, Rafinha failed to make any contact with the winger\u2019s inviting low ball. Betis get off the hook. Head in hands stuff for Valverde. Antoine Griezmann pokes the ball home after latching on to a sweeping dinked Sergi Roberto cross. Semedo charged forward and then shifted the ball inside but the pass is gorgeous and Griezmann, on the stretch, throws himself at the cross and steers home beyond Dani Mart\u00edn with his left leg. With that, Barcelona restore parity and the whole mood inside Camp Nou changes. 39 min: Rafinha and Busquets sandwich Fekir \u2013 and Betis earn a free-kick on halfway, a little respite. Barcelona have been fairly unrelenting if unconvincing in the final third. But, again, back come Barcelona down the right flank ... 37 min: Big chance for Barcelona! Busquets slips in Jordi Alba on the overlap but \u2013 again \u2013 Rafinha cannot convert. This time, in fairness, it is brilliant last-ditch defending by Sidnei, who diverts the ball away for a corner, which is cleared. 36 min: Ter Stegen is on his toes to prevent Betis from earning a throw-in in the final third. \u201cPlaying Frenkie de Jong out wide on the left in a sort of Coutinho last season role completely nullifies his qualities both creatively and defensively,\u201d tweets @waiworinao. \u201cAny idea what Valverde\u2019s thinking is, because I certainly don\u2019t.\u201d 33 min: Rafinha jinks into the box after a neat give-and-go with Sergi Roberto \u2013 but the Brazilian slips at the crucial moment! Rafinha really should do better but as Marc Bartra galloped out of defence to close him down inside the box, the winger lost his footing and crashed to the turf. Barcelona appealed half-heartedly for a penalty but Rafinha\u2019s fall was all of his own doing. 32 min: Betis fly forward and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 cuts across Loren, fouling the forward and earning a booking in the process. Fekir has a go from 25 yards but Ter Stegen pats a stinging shot away from danger. It was a comfortable save. 31 min: And now Sidnei makes a strong \u2013 but seemingly fair \u2013 challenge on Griezmann. Barcelona are really not having it all their own way. And not only are Bar\u00e7a struggling to breach Betis, they are struggling to contain them too ... 30 min: Carles P\u00e9rez bombs to the byline but Andr\u00e9s Guardado throws himself to the floor to make life difficult and get a crucial block in. Betis zoom up the other end and Fekir buys a clever foul to relieve some heavy pressure. 28 min: It is early days but that Fekir strike means the France forward has pretty nifty conversion rate: it was his first La Liga goal (in his second game) with his maiden shot on target in the competition. Not bad going \u2013 it was a super finish. 25 min: It is panic stations in the Betis box as a corner kindly drops for Griezmann, but the Frenchman\u2019s shot is expertly blocked. Betis have already shown they are happy to dig their heels in. 23 min: In the posh seats, Luis Su\u00e1rez is gnawing on his hand and Lionel Messi\u2019s children cannot bear to look. It\u2019s not going to plan for Bar\u00e7a. It is not for the want of trying, with Sergi Roberto\u2019s rattling strike deflected over the bar. 21 min: Another long spell of possession ends on a bum-note, with Gerard Piqu\u00e9 overcooking a pass over the top for Carles P\u00e9rez. 19 min: Barcelona go back to knocking the ball around rather serenely but the reality is they are behind, despite dominating the first 15 minutes. Fekir seized the one sniff of goal he was given, while Valverde\u2019s side have squandered a couple of half-chances, with Sergi Roberto\u2019s header arguably their best opening. Against the run of play, Nabil Fekir strikes. Busquets passes up possession on halfway and Loren slips in Fekir, whose finish is truly sumptuous. Sloppy as far as Bar\u00e7a will be concerned but a brilliant goal for Betis, who had very much been second best during the opening stages in Catalonia. It had been one-way traffic. Now, how will Ernesto Valverde\u2019s men respond? They haven\u2019t lost their opening two league matches since 1964-65. 14 min: And now Griezmann has another low effort saved. 12 min: Jordi Alba plays a wonderful cross from the left and Sergi Roberto has a free header \u2013 but he gets it all wrong. The midfielder should do better. 11 min: An encouraging start by Carles P\u00e9rez, who skirts round the edge of the Betis box while clinging on to possession. Betis have 11 men behind the ball and they are already having to dig deep to fend off the hosts. 9 min: More of the same from Bar\u00e7a. It is going to be a long evening for Betis at this rate. Griezmann looks in the mood to wreak havoc and the visitors are struggling to get near him. 6 min: Antoine Griezmann\u2019s deflected shot cannons just wide of goal! Bar\u00e7a are certainly taking the game to their opponents. 5 min: Betis seem fragile defensively, with Carles P\u00e9rez doing superbly, drifting inside before laying the ball on a plate for Frenkie de Jong on the penalty spot. But the Dutchman is caught cold and freezes in possession and Betis turn it over. 4 min: Betis are stretched \u2013 but Rafinha cannot catch the ball cleanly and Martin makes a strong save! Griezmann bulldozed into a challenge, with the loose ball running kindly into the path of Jordi Alba, who played in Rafinha and then almost ended up back in the thick of things. But Betis clear their lines. 1 min: Barcelona hog possession early on, with Gerard Piqu\u00e9 \u2013 this his 500th appearance for the club \u2013 knocking the ball about in the defence. Frenkie de Jong is playing in the left of a midfield three, with Barcelona 4-3-3. All Bar\u00e7a in the opening stages. Sergio Busquets wins the toss and Barcelona kick-off. Ernesto Valverde will hope he doesn\u2019t come to need him \u2013 but the Barcelona manager has named 16-year-old Ansu Fati on his substitutes\u2019 bench. The forward, who was born in Guinea-Bissau, has excelled as part of V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s\u2019s youth side and, with Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 all absent, there is room for the teenager on the bench. If he does jump off the bench, he will become the youngest Bar\u00e7a debutant since Vicente Mart\u00ednez in 1941-42. Messi is currently fifth on the all time youngest ever list, making his debut at 17 years and 114 days old in 2004. Another youngster, the 21-year-old Carles P\u00e9rez, makes his first La Liga start for the champions, forming part of the Bar\u00e7a front three. Essential pre-match reading, courtesy of Jonathan Wilson: Recap Saturday\u2019s action across the continent: There is a game about to be played at Camp Nou \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t stop the rumour mill working overtime. There is talk swirling around that Juventus have met with representatives of the Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic, who is on the bench this evening. As for Neymar, that noise just will not go away, with the Brazilian linked with a return to Barcelona before next Monday\u2019s transfer deadline. Team news news: Gerard Piqu\u00e9 makes his 500th appearance in a Barcelona shirt, after making his debut in 2008 against Racing Santander. Antoine Griezmann will lead the line but there is no Lionel Messi, as expected. As for Betis, Nabil Fekir caused problems for Bar\u00e7a with Lyon last season, while the manager Rubi, a member of the 2013-14 Bar\u00e7a coaching staff, has called on former Bar\u00e7a players Marc Bartra and Cristian Tello from the off, while two more, Kaptoum and summer signing Junior Firpo, are among those on the bench. The Barcelona team does not look quite so regal with Messi but there is no shortage of ability. Barcelona (4-3-3): Ter Stegen; Semedo, Piqu\u00e9, Lenglet, Jordi Alba; Busquets, Sergi Roberto, De Jong; P\u00e9rez, Griezmann, Rafinha Subs: Fati, Rakitic, Sotorres, Firpo, Umtiti, Vidal, Melo Real Betis (4-2-3-1): Martin; Pedraza, Sidnei, Bartra, Emerson; Guardado, Carvalho; Tello, Canales, Fekir; Loren Subs: Dani Rebollo, Mandi, Javi Garcia, Kaptoum, Joaquin, Lainez, Juanmi Referee: Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Believe it or not, Barcelona kick-off 18th in La Liga. A shock opening-day defeat to Athletic Bilbao left the Messi-less champions pointless but they can get back on song with victory over Real Betis this evening. The season is of course only 90 minutes old and It seems unlikely that Bar\u00e7a will depart Camp Nou empty-handed given they won 15 of their 19 league on home soil last season, while Ernesto Valverde will demand more from those who flattered to deceive last time out. Betis are no mugs \u2013 they finished 10th last season \u2013 but defeat to Real Valladolid hardly set the pulses racing and leaves them with an unenviable task in Catalonia. In terms of team news, Messi is not part of the 18-man squad owing to a pesky calf injury despite returning to first-team training, which is a crying shame. Neither are Luis Su\u00e1rez and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Kick-off: 8pm (BST)",

But what\u2019s this? An attack upon Sindy Doll? Fie, fool! She is a finer horsewoman than that! Next came the most distressing incident of the past five series: an attempt on the life of Horace the Pug, who had already distinguished himself early on by barking for the first time. Thank goodness for Dr Enys\u2019s transferable skills. Horace was swiftly revived. I did experience extreme distress at the thought of his demise.</p> \n<p>Sindy Doll\u2019s finest hour came when she recovered from being a frivolous busybody nosing in her husband\u2019s medical notes and instead put the information to good use, blackmailing Sir Evil George. This occasioned one of the best exchanges ever between George and Cary Warleggan: \u201cWhy are we protecting some local lunatic?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not. We\u2019re protecting you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, many other incidents piled upon each other, enough to last another five series of Poldark if the BBC budget had stretched. Tess Tregidden be up to some wickedness with Sam the Preacher. (\u201cI have been called by God to bring souls to salvation. Tess be such a soul.\u201d No, Sam, she be not. She be taking you for a ride.) Jacka and his crew continued with their thievin\u2019, swapping the ore for brandy, tea and rum, the ungrateful varmints. Prudie did some great facial expressions. Ursula, the she-bear baby that everyone had forgotten about (and who caused Elizabeth to die) turned out to still be alive and surprisingly recently birthed. And Morwenna and Drake finally had some good news: \u201cWe have news to share. A blessed day might soon be coming.\u201d \u201cWe do expect.\u201d \u201cA child?\u201d If things continue like this, a replacement pug might be more useful.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s left in our last hour with Team Nampara? Ross has to avenge himself on all the slave-traders, start a revolution with the help of the French, keep Demelza on side, stop Tess and Jacka from stealing both his ore and his religious brother-in-law, save the King from traitors and finally get his own back on Sir Evil George. Oh, yes, and somehow reclaim Valentine without offending Demelza. Hey, if anyone can do this in an hour, it\u2019s Ross. \u201cDo you think me an idiot?\u201d \u201cYes. But an idiot I love beyond measure.\u201d Ah, you and the rest of us, Demelza.

And, of course, there\u2019s no avoiding the comparison with the fate of Geoffrey Charles\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, who was also never able to marry the right person at the right time. I didn\u2019t shed a tear but I did have a momentary lapse of cynicism and, frankly, that\u2019s quite impressive at the moment.</p> \n<h2>Classic Poldark lines</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>\u201cIs your opinion required?\u201d \u201cNo, but it should be.\u201d Come on, Valentine!

      "bodyText": "A Kansas City woman woke one morning this week thinking she had water in her left ear. It turned out to be a highly venomous brown recluse spider. Susie Torres told local TV station Fox 4 she \u201cwoke up [on] Tuesday hearing a bunch of swooshing and water in my left ear\u201d. The sensation, she said, was \u201clike when you went swimming\u201d. When she went to get her ears checked, she told KHSB, a medical assistant took a look then \u201cran out and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get a couple more people.\u2019 \u201cShe then said, \u2018I think you have an insect in there.\u2019\u201d It turned out to be an arachnid, about the size of a dime. \u201cThey had a few tools and worked their magic and got it out,\u201d Torres said. The spider did not bite Torres during its time in her ear, which was lucky for her. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the brown recluse, which is generally found in the US south and midwest, \u201ccannot bite humans without some form of counter pressure, for example, through unintentional contact that traps the spider against the skin\u201d. But it adds: \u201cThe venom of a brown recluse can cause a severe lesion by destroying skin tissue (skin necrosis)\u201d which \u201cwill require professional medical attention\u201d. The CDC says brown recluses, recognisable from violin-shaped markings on their heads, are \u201cusually found in workplaces with secluded, dry, sheltered areas such as underneath structures [or] logs, or in piles of rocks or leaves. \u201cIf a brown recluse spider wanders indoors, they may be found in dark closets, shoes, or attics.\u201d Hair-raising stories of people scared or bitten by brown recluses tend to attract press attention. In 2015, a 40-year-old British man said his leg was left \u201cbursting open\u201d after a bite on a flight from Qatar to South Africa. In 2018 another man told the Guardian how he nearly lost an arm after being bitten by a brown recluse hiding in a fruit bowl in London. \u201cI had both a dermonecrotic and systemic reaction,\u201d Henry Moffett said, \u201cmeaning not only that the venom killed off skin and tissue but also my organs started to shut down as my blood thickened, which is rare and can be fatal. \u201cThe doctors had to constantly put me under to open the back of my hand to cut away the flesh, trying to stop the venom and necrosis (the death of tissue cells) spreading further.\u201d \u201cAfter two weeks in hospital,\u201d Moffett added, \u201cthe doctor recommended amputating the arm up to the elbow because of the risk of necrosis spreading to my heart.

He played stone sober that night, and barely attempted a scoring shot. There was a clip off his hips for one single, an inside-edge past short leg for another, and that was it. He had made two runs from 50 balls when they drew stumps, had two off 66 when Root was caught behind off Nathan Lyon right before Australia took the new ball on Sunday morning.

Then Head ran out Jos Buttler, and Chris Woakes thrashed a catch to short extra cover, and England had three wickets left and needed the best part of another 100 runs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/ben-stokes-ashes-cricket\">Ben Stokes says \u2018he never gave up\u2019 in batting heroics to keep Ashes alive</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Same old England.

So even when he was out, lbw when England needed two more runs, he somehow got away with it. Stokes did not even stop to acknowledge the hundred he made when he cracked four through long-on, but pressed on, sixes were hit deep into the Western Terrace, fours belted so hard they were puncturing gaps in the nine-man cordon Tim Paine had set on the boundary\u2019s edge.

But it\u2019s Sunday night at Pride \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration concentrating on something else \u2013 it\u2019s about Pride.\u201d Armed police patrolled the fringes of the festival amid extra tight security inside but that did not deter the party atmosphere. \u201cThe scale of it and the vibe is off the scale,\u201d said Nathaniel Thornton, 28, wearing a rainbow coloured costume decorated with a hand-crafted Manchester bee at his second Pride. \u201cAfter the bombings we came to Manchester the following day when we had the vigils. This year we would\u2019ve come anyway but the fact Ariana is here amplifies it. Kudos to her.\u201d",

Below the pleasantly gilded surface, however, there has been an undercurrent of bitterness and anxiety at the summit. Boxed in by multiple global crises, the group of major industrialised democracies is arguably at its most divided since its founding in 1977. Trump has been arguing for Russian readmission since the G7 summit in Quebec last year and appeared determined to revive the demand, bringing it up in a discussion about Iran policy and taking his counterparts by surprise with the vehemence of his views on the subject. There was nervousness about Trump\u2019s arrival, in the midst of a trade war with China and his reported reluctance to attend, arguing it was not a good use of his time. At the previous summit in Quebec, Trump left early and ordered US officials to withdraw his agreement to a joint communiqu\u00e9. As a precaution this year, Macron decreed there would be no communiqu\u00e9 to withdraw from. In an attempt to win over Trump, Macron staged a benign ambush as the US president arrived, whisking him off to an unscheduled lunch, where the two men talked without officials or aides for nearly two hours. Trump later tweeted that it was \u201cthe best meeting we have yet had\u201d, though he misspelt the French president\u2019s name and accidentally linked to a parody Macron account, which has since been suspended. Macron\u2019s tactics infuriated some US officials, who called several members of the travelling White House press on Saturday afternoon to leak against the French host, claiming he had filled the summit agenda with \u201cniche\u201d subjects such as climate change and equality with his own domestic audience in mind, rather than sticking to global economics and trade, which have traditionally been the focus of G7 meetings.

      "body": "<p>Headingley 1981 was a foregone conclusion compared with this.

But on a day like this who cares about rankings anyway? Ben Stokes produced the innings of a lifetime to snatch a one-wicket victory, which keeps the Ashes alive and the game alive, while threatening to cause multiple heart failures among those lucky enough to witness this contest.</p> \n<p>A few figures: England, bowled out for 67 in the first innings, achieved their highest-ever winning total by scoring 362 for nine at this unlikely theatre of dreams on the other side of the Pennines from Old Trafford. The last-wicket partnership \u2013 somehow unbroken \u2013 between Jack Leach and Stokes was worth 76. Stokes finished, most definitely unbeaten, on 135, which included eight sixes; he had 61 when Leach made his way to the crease.</p> \n<p>But beyond the figures was astounding melodrama and we have to start near the end. It defied belief that England had reached 351 for nine when Australia\u2019s captain, Tim Paine \u2013 who, like his counterpart Kim Hughes all those years ago, had every reason to believe this match had already been decided \u2013 tossed the ball to Nathan Lyon. Stokes was on strike with eight runs needed for victory. He cut the first two deliveries to distant fielders and declined to run, following the pattern of an already a stunning partnership.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/aug/25/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-third-test-day-four-live\">Ashes 2019: England v Australia, third Test day four \u2013&nbsp;live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The third ball from Lyon was fuller and Stokes swung. He did not quite time it perfectly but he does not have to. At long-off Marnus Labuschagne circled; at the bowler\u2019s end Lyon squinted towards the boundary, urging the ball to stay in play. By a metre or so it cleared the rope. For the first time in the match England were rock- solid favourites to win. One run would be sufficient for a tie, two for victory.</p> \n<p>Now the field came in. This must have felt claustrophobic for Stokes. For the previous hour the vast majority of the fielders had been stationed on the boundary when he was on strike. The next ball was cut by Stokes straight to one of the fielders now close enough to save the single. No matter; there were two deliveries left and after his recent pyrotechnics surely Stokes would now deliver the final blow.</p> \n<p>Lyon fired in the next delivery and Stokes cut again. Leach started scrambling a run; Stokes sent him back but it was clear as the throw from Pat Cummins headed towards Lyon that England\u2019s valiant No 11 would be stranded. Home hearts sank until Lyon fumbled the ball, and the images of Australia\u2019s 1999 World Cup semi-final against South Africa flashed past.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6343146a-8aa6-42fc-8dcd-2e1dc3fa7258\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-3goA2UtMWk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One ball remained and Stokes decided to explore the legside this time. He slog-swept but missed. Lyon\u2019s appeal was prolonged, suggesting an odd mix of desperation and confidence. Umpire Joel Wilson\u2019s finger failed to appear but the realisation that the Australians were unable to ask for a review did come to light. They had wasted their last review against Leach in the previous over from Cummins (incidentally the solitary area in which England have been consistently superior in this series is in their use of DRS). The subsequent replay demonstrated that Stokes would have been out if it had been possible to review the decision.</p> \n<p>After that it was relatively plain sailing. Unusually, Leach was left on strike as Cummins ran in at the start of the next over. He ducked the first ball, defended the second and the third saw the ball trickle from his bat on the legside. Leach\u2019s first run in the partnership had levelled the scores. In came Cummins again; Stokes crashed the ball to the cover boundary and the most amazing Test match of all was over.</p> \n<p>There were one or two dramas before those final 10 deliveries. Even the first four overs of the day, which were all maidens, somehow added to the tension. The first single by Root was cheered to the skies and then England\u2019s captain departed, superbly caught by David Warner off the inside edge and pad off the bowling of Lyon as he advanced down the pitch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6aee86c121e899f8b8e771512c9c7be783acf9ed\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aee86c121e899f8b8e771512c9c7be783acf9ed/37_0_4185_2511/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes was wrongly given not out by umpire Joel Wilson after being trapped in front by Nathan Lyon but Australia were unable to review.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes was wrongly given not out by umpire Joel Wilson after being trapped in front by Nathan Lyon but Australia were unable to review.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Paine took the new ball as soon as it became available. It seemed the obvious thing to do yet it led to a sudden acceleration in the run rate. Jonny Bairstow was in skittish mood and two consecutive drives off Josh Hazlewood reached the offside boundary. Gradually, after hours of abstinence, Stokes began to find the odd boundary. The 50 partnership was posted inside 10 overs and as if in celebration Stokes lifted a legside delivery from Cummins into the stands.</p> \n<p>At lunch England, on 238 for four, might have been favourites, though this realisation did not seem to do them much good. They proceeded to lose five wickets for 48 runs after the interval with only Stokes looking in control \u2013 except on a few occasions when he was contemplating what constituted a run.</p> \n<p>Bairstow was caught in the slips for a very handy 36 then Jos Buttler was probably a victim of poor calling from Stokes. He was sent back too late as Travis Head hit the stumps, so there could be no reprieve of their World Cup final partnership. Chris Woakes, mindful that a bouncer barrage was on its way, was lodged on the back foot when driving at a rare full ball and caught at mid-off. Jofra Archer swished three boundaries but was then well caught in the deep by Head and Stuart Broad was palpably lbw to his second delivery. 283 for nine. Ah well.

      "bodyText": "Headingley 1981 was a foregone conclusion compared with this. So, too, the World Cup final in July, as Ian Botham\u2019s incredible exploits of 38 years ago have been matched, maybe surpassed. But on a day like this who cares about rankings anyway? Ben Stokes produced the innings of a lifetime to snatch a one-wicket victory, which keeps the Ashes alive and the game alive, while threatening to cause multiple heart failures among those lucky enough to witness this contest. A few figures: England, bowled out for 67 in the first innings, achieved their highest-ever winning total by scoring 362 for nine at this unlikely theatre of dreams on the other side of the Pennines from Old Trafford. The last-wicket partnership \u2013 somehow unbroken \u2013 between Jack Leach and Stokes was worth 76. Stokes finished, most definitely unbeaten, on 135, which included eight sixes; he had 61 when Leach made his way to the crease. But beyond the figures was astounding melodrama and we have to start near the end. It defied belief that England had reached 351 for nine when Australia\u2019s captain, Tim Paine \u2013 who, like his counterpart Kim Hughes all those years ago, had every reason to believe this match had already been decided \u2013 tossed the ball to Nathan Lyon. Stokes was on strike with eight runs needed for victory. He cut the first two deliveries to distant fielders and declined to run, following the pattern of an already a stunning partnership. The third ball from Lyon was fuller and Stokes swung. He did not quite time it perfectly but he does not have to. At long-off Marnus Labuschagne circled; at the bowler\u2019s end Lyon squinted towards the boundary, urging the ball to stay in play. By a metre or so it cleared the rope. For the first time in the match England were rock- solid favourites to win. One run would be sufficient for a tie, two for victory. Now the field came in. This must have felt claustrophobic for Stokes. For the previous hour the vast majority of the fielders had been stationed on the boundary when he was on strike. The next ball was cut by Stokes straight to one of the fielders now close enough to save the single. No matter; there were two deliveries left and after his recent pyrotechnics surely Stokes would now deliver the final blow. Lyon fired in the next delivery and Stokes cut again. Leach started scrambling a run; Stokes sent him back but it was clear as the throw from Pat Cummins headed towards Lyon that England\u2019s valiant No 11 would be stranded. Home hearts sank until Lyon fumbled the ball, and the images of Australia\u2019s 1999 World Cup semi-final against South Africa flashed past. One ball remained and Stokes decided to explore the legside this time. He slog-swept but missed. Lyon\u2019s appeal was prolonged, suggesting an odd mix of desperation and confidence. Umpire Joel Wilson\u2019s finger failed to appear but the realisation that the Australians were unable to ask for a review did come to light. They had wasted their last review against Leach in the previous over from Cummins (incidentally the solitary area in which England have been consistently superior in this series is in their use of DRS). The subsequent replay demonstrated that Stokes would have been out if it had been possible to review the decision. After that it was relatively plain sailing. Unusually, Leach was left on strike as Cummins ran in at the start of the next over. He ducked the first ball, defended the second and the third saw the ball trickle from his bat on the legside. Leach\u2019s first run in the partnership had levelled the scores. In came Cummins again; Stokes crashed the ball to the cover boundary and the most amazing Test match of all was over. There were one or two dramas before those final 10 deliveries. Even the first four overs of the day, which were all maidens, somehow added to the tension. The first single by Root was cheered to the skies and then England\u2019s captain departed, superbly caught by David Warner off the inside edge and pad off the bowling of Lyon as he advanced down the pitch. Paine took the new ball as soon as it became available. It seemed the obvious thing to do yet it led to a sudden acceleration in the run rate. Jonny Bairstow was in skittish mood and two consecutive drives off Josh Hazlewood reached the offside boundary. Gradually, after hours of abstinence, Stokes began to find the odd boundary. The 50 partnership was posted inside 10 overs and as if in celebration Stokes lifted a legside delivery from Cummins into the stands. At lunch England, on 238 for four, might have been favourites, though this realisation did not seem to do them much good. They proceeded to lose five wickets for 48 runs after the interval with only Stokes looking in control \u2013 except on a few occasions when he was contemplating what constituted a run. Bairstow was caught in the slips for a very handy 36 then Jos Buttler was probably a victim of poor calling from Stokes. He was sent back too late as Travis Head hit the stumps, so there could be no reprieve of their World Cup final partnership. Chris Woakes, mindful that a bouncer barrage was on its way, was lodged on the back foot when driving at a rare full ball and caught at mid-off. Jofra Archer swished three boundaries but was then well caught in the deep by Head and Stuart Broad was palpably lbw to his second delivery. 283 for nine. Ah well. It had been a good game. Now Leach, with his unassuming West Country gait, walked out to join Stokes with 73 runs needed for victory. Perhaps one or two despondent punters opted to beat the traffic at this point. Now Stokes switched from Denly mode to d\u2019Artagnan. The fielders were spread far and wide but still he hit Lyon for two consecutive sixes, the second of which was the most preposterous switch-hit into the Western Terrace. He flicked a short ball from Cummins over his left shoulder for another brilliantly improvised six. Upon reaching his 100, the best of his career (he will have to live with that knowledge now \u2013 and it was far better than his 258 in Cape Town), he did not celebrate. That was not his goal. Next Stokes took 17 runs from a Hazlewood over, pull shots, drives and legside flicks, which magically just managed to keep finding or clearing the boundary. A half-chance flew to Marcus Harris at third man but he could not quite cling on as he dived forward. This was beyond Roy of the Rovers. Meanwhile, Leach ostensibly remained calm, despite the fact that his glasses kept steaming up. Hardly surprising. Amid the jubilation Leach could ponder that he had now won two matches for England with the bat in the surreal summer of 2019: 92 against Ireland, one not out against Australia. With due respect to Tim Murtagh and co, we all know which innings he will cherish the most.",

      "bodyText": "Hawthorn\u2019s success over the past 50 years \u2013 during which they have won a dozen flags \u2013 makes them the only AFL club for which a period of nearly four years could be classified as a post-premiership era. While the happy stories of the Hawks are long, the successes of many of those who represented them in Perth on Saturday night are considerably shorter \u2013 13 of the 22 have not enjoyed the ultimate success at the club, including 62-gamer Tim O\u2019Brien, whose three second-half goals helped the Hawks to a 38-point upset against West Coast. Importantly, the man who has run the show for Hawthorn since 2005 is still there. And while he may have ultimately fallen short of taking his team to an unlikely September campaign (with three weeks to go, the Hawks\u2019 season seemed over, sitting two games and considerable percentage outside the top eight) he did engineer a disaster for the Eagles, who just over two weeks ago were two games and percentage clear in the top four. On the weekend, the Eagles played well below their statistical mean at precisely the wrong time. There were moments on Saturday night when it seemed West Coast\u2019s entire team forgot the fundamental movements required to play football \u2013 certainly to the level they will now require, having to travel for three consecutive weeks if they are to defend their title. The Eagles\u2019 place in the top four has been taken by Collingwood, who the night before beat an Essendon side that has, perhaps, survived inside the eight more than earned a place in it. While we are often led to think of a season as a sort of novel, the Pies\u2019 year has been more a collection of patchy short stories. The common threads were injury and stupidity \u2013 both of which were evident on the weekend, with a hamstrung Darcy Moore and the contentious return to football of Jaidyn Stephenson. But ultimately it is their numbers \u2013 15 wins \u2013 that will see Collingwood host minor premiers Geelong in the first qualifying final, an arrangement that rankled Cats coach Chris Scott. \u201cI\u2019m going to take it away from the Geelong thing, because anyone that\u2019s not a Geelong supporter just considers it whingeing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing I will say is that most normal people know the system is wrong. There can be no doubting that it\u2019s wrong. But it is what it is. West Coast and Brisbane, GWS for that matter, maybe the Crows and Port, have to come and win a grand final \u2013 probably at their opposition\u2019s home ground as well.\u201d Well, maybe not the soon-to-implode Crows, who had their doors blown off by the Western Bulldogs. They kicked five of the last six goals to lose by a half-way respectable 34 points \u2013 although still approximately 21-goals short of the outcome required for an unlikely finals berth and a round-23 Hail Mary for more than a few Adelaide contracts. In contrast, the Dogs won their fourth game in five weeks to finish seventh \u2013 the same position from which they launched their premiership run in 2016. Given West Coast\u2019s stumble, it\u2019s not difficult to make the argument that the Bulldogs are the most dangerous team outside the top four, especially having thumped their elimination final opponents, the GWS Giants, by 10 goals last week. The form side going into the finals is Richmond, who on Sunday had the better of Brisbane by close to five goals in front of the biggest home-and-away crowd featuring a team from outside Victoria. The Tigers have won nine consecutive games and have form players across every line, particularly in defence where Dylan Grimes and Nick Vlastuin have ably covered the loss of All-Australian full-back Alex Rance. The Tigers will again meet Brisbane in the second qualifying final \u2013 the qualifier being that this time it will be on Brisbane\u2019s home turf at \u2018The Gabbatoir\u2019. Brisbane lost few fans on Sunday afternoon, matching Richmond after Jack Riewoldt kicked four first-quarter goals. The unanimous recruit of the year, Lachie Neale, had a day out, winning a career-best 51 possessions (at an efficiency better than 88 per cent) and 14 clearances.

It follows a $150m investment, 12 months ago, from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to encourage emissions reduction projects in Australia\u2019s biggest infrastructure projects. The aim was to have IFM use its position on the board of critical infrastructure companies to introduce firm emissions reduction targets and reporting requirements within the year.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with some rather hotter-off-the-press gold from David Hytner \u2013 the match report! Here it is: Thanks for joining me today, as ever, and enjoy the rest of your weekend! #stat Steve Porter writes that today was \u201cprobably the worst performance of the Poch era\u201d. Do we agree? Lucas Moura missed Spurs\u2019 biggest chance today. But he\u2019s still had a sensational few months. I should have linked you to David Hytner\u2019s superb interview with him at the top of the show. In fact it might serve as a pick-me-up for their fans now, so here it is: Sean Longstaff: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of criticism towards us and the manager but today\u2019s shown what a good team we are and how committed we are. The fans have backed us massively, on a Sunday when the trains are off, and if it wasn\u2019t for them we wouldn\u2019t be the club we are.\u201d Paul Dummett (who was named man of the match): \u201cWe had to keep our shape and discipline and we did that from the start. It\u2019s been a massive week, it\u2019s a hard league to play in and we knew it\u2019d be a tough game. Credit to everyone on the pitch, the manager and the staff, for sticking together.\u201d As for Spurs \u2013 they are not playing well, are they? It was flat and one-paced out there, even after Eriksen came on. In fact it reminded me of a similar home d efeat to West Ham at the back end of last season. Ndombele should add some dynamism when fit again, while they\u2019ll be glad of Dele Alli\u2019s ability to sniff out bits and pieces near the box when he\u2019s fit again. But something isn\u2019t quite right. I wonder whether they can go through yet another season without a proper striking backup/alternative to Kane. On the evidence of these first three weeks, the battle for places three to six could be wide open. Have to say, I\u2019m really happy for Steve Bruce there. He\u2019s one of the good guys and hasn\u2019t deserved the early stick at Newcastle \u2013 we all know the problems run deeper there. He outmanoeuvred Pochettino today and his players had clearly taken everything onboard that he told them during the week. They were intensely disciplined but dangerous, too \u2013 a perfect away performance, in other words, and a huge response to last week. There *was* added-time drama at Molineux, where Raul Jimenez has rescued a 1-1 draw for Wolves against Burnley in the 96th minute. What a result for \u2013 and performance by \u2013 Newcastle! And what a concern for Spurs! 90+6 min: And now Almiron wins a free-kick near the Spurs corner flag on the left, and Newcastle have a golden chance to see out time now ... 90+4 min: Moura slips the marauding Sissoko in, and he clips back to Kane ... but the striker fluffs it, failing to make meaningful contact! To be fair the ball came at speed and was not at a good height \u2013 Kane was close in but it would have taken quite some finish. 90+3 min: Even at this late stage, Newcastle\u2019s shape is absolutely *textbook*. Spurs just can\u2019t pull them around; they earn another corner but, from it, another Son shot is blocked. 90+1 min: They have SIX added minutes to find it! Eriksen whips a cross-shot past the post, via Dubravka\u2019s fingertips, and the keeper claws his subsequent corner away. 89 min: The disappointing Son scoops an easy cross to a grateful Dubravka and Spurs need something very, very last-ditch now. 88 min: Great chance on the counter for Newcastle, but Almiron\u2019s pass *just* goes beyond Joelinton, who would have been clear. Almiron then has a shot deflected off target after Joelinton chases and takes possession. That\u2019s it for the striker, who has run himself into the ground, and Muto comes on. For Spurs, Ben Davies replaces Rose. 86 min: Spurs are in now-or-never territory now. They haven\u2019t really built on that Moura chance yet. Newcastle are defending the box so, so well. 83 min: Newcastle get some light relief now though \u2013 it\u2019s a corner for them. Sanchez knocks it away near the penalty spot. Then Joelinton does well again, laying off to Atsu in a good area, but he loses possession with a heavy touch. 82 min: Lascelles was injured in not fouling Kane, and is replaced by Fernandez. The sub has a job on his hands back there in what will be a frantic last 10. 81 min: A clear chance for Spurs \u2013 and Moura has to score, surely? Eriksen weights a lovely diagonal ball to Sissoko and his cross sits up for an unmarked Moura to volley home ... but he flashes it over! Can Spurs take encouragement from the last few minutes? It\u2019s taken them a long time but they\u2019ve got in twice ... 79 min: PENALTY NOT GIVEN! It looked to me as if Lascelles did, indeed, cut across Kane and foul him as he sprawled over. But the VAR didn\u2019t think so \u2013 maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been a \u201cclear and obvious\u201d error, in which case I would sympathise with the decision. 78 min: Ooooh, Lo Celso slips Kane in down the side of Lascelles and the striker is sent tumbling ... we\u2019ll have a VAR check for a penalty here ... 77 min: A weak and incredibly speculative effort from Son highlights that Spurs are getting desperate. 75 min: I can hardly believe how little Spurs have created today, even allowing for this highly laudable Newcastle performance. Dubravka has been seriously worked, what, once? 74 min: \u201cI notice Spurs have been borrowing from the Guardiola playbook: two thirds or three quarters of the possession and still managing two or three times as many fouls as the opposition. It\u2019s the beautiful game,\u201d waxes Geoff Wignall. 73 min: Joelinton will continue for now and, yet again, Newcastle get back in position and prepare to face some serious keepball. 71 min: Joelinton is down in a heap in the Spurs half but the home side play on. Bruce is furious but they continue to probe, before Winks crosses unconvincingly to Dubravka and the goalscorer gets some treatment. 68 min: Rose now wins a corner after what, this time, is some slightly frayed defending. It\u2019s worked to Rose on the edge of the box but Joelinton swats his underhit cross away. Spurs really have not got going here at all! 66 min: Rose is booked for catching Schar, who howls in pain. Some Spurs frustrations creeping in? 64 min: Moura skews wide from range and Newcastle remain in relative comfort. It\u2019s been such a big effort from them so far. 63 min: Anyway, Eriksen now replaces Walker-Peters \u2013 I am not sure that was the original plan \u2013 and Lo Celso is on for Lamela. 61 min: Walker-Peters pulls up when challenging Atsu and the Newcastle winger finds Joelinton with a deep cross, inviting a spectacular volley. It would be some goal but he can\u2019t catch it properly and Lloris saves with ease. 60 min: Here comes Eriksen, in a few moments anyway. His final game? Maybe, maybe not, but for now Spurs just need him to dig them out of a hole. Lo Celso, the summer arrival, will join us presently too. 58 min: A smart move between Joelinton and Almiron brings Newcastle their first flag kick of this half. Lascelles stoops to win the flick on, but Lloris rises to claim. 56 min: Dummett deals with Rose\u2019s low cross, with Kane lurking. Moura flicks a header well off target a little afterwards. The pressure is on Newcastle\u2019s defence now, but they are holding firm. 54 min: Joelinton has done well up front, often ploughing a lone furrow, quite aside from his goal. With Wesley scoring for Villa and Haller getting two for West Ham, it\u2019s been a great weekend for expensive new centre-forwards. 52 min: Schar makes a brilliant challenge on Lamela there, though, after Son\u2019s scuffed shot falls to him 10 yards out. It looked for a moment as if Spurs would get that big chance. 51 min: It\u2019s very much \u201cas you were\u201d currently. Spurs with all of the ball but barely a glimmer of a way through. 48 min: Dean waves an early yellow at Ritchie, who was beaten to the ball by Walker-Peters and clipped him. Spurs have a free-kick in a tasty position for a cross, but Lamela\u2019s ball is bad. The second half has begun. We\u2019ll see Eriksen very soon if Spurs continue to flounder, won\u2019t we? There\u2019s not a lot else on that bench to change the game. Spurs\u2019 lack of depth up front doesn\u2019t go away. Half-time reading from the great Jonathan Wilson: \u201cDom, Fatalistic of Tunbridge Wells\u201d writes in: \u201cGah, Elvis style I have this game on and the cricket summary on two screens and I knew Spurs will drain any Ashes euphoria from me. This game had \u2018muff-up\u2019 written on it from the release of the fixtures. We will have 219% possession, but all our passes will be 10 yards sideways. We will have 50 shots. None will be on target and 3 will end up outside of the WHL postcode. Toon will run up the pitch and kick it in the net (again). It\u2019s just a given. \u201cPost-match Bruce will hail a \u2018turning point\u2019 and they will promptly lose their next game five-nil to three sleep deprived apes and a hat. Still, well done Ben Stokes.\u201d Pretty much spot-on so far, bar the shot count. Moura skews wide under pressure from Atsu after Dubravka misses a Kane cross, in perhaps Spurs\u2019 best chance of the half, and then Dean blows his whistle. Not for the first time this season, Spurs have it all to do. And they haven\u2019t done a lot yet, hogging virtually all the possession but \u2013 until just then \u2013 creating just the one half-opportunity for Son. We have hardly seen a peep out of Kane. Newcastle have been supremely disciplined and have looked dangerous when attacking \u2013 a point proved devastatingly when Joelinton rifled in the only goal so far. 45+ 1 min: Almiron earns another Newcastle corner in the first of three added minutes. Could they compound Spurs\u2019 first-half woe? Hayden wins the header but it loops well off target. 44 min: In fact, look at those possession stats on the left. Spurs have had 82% of it and that\u2019s rising! Yet few would disagree Newcastle are well worth their lead. The figures often tell little of the story. 43 min: Spurs are enjoying a lot of possession in front of the Newcastle defence, but getting nowhere with it. 40 min: They need to keep their concentration though, as Son finds space a little too easily and drags a shot wide from 20 yards. 39 min: Newcastle look a million miles from the side that got tanked at Norwich. Atsu makes for the area again after a Walker-Peters error but can\u2019t get past Alderweireld as he seeks space to shoot. 37 min: Newcastle fancy another one but Sanchez, whose positioning was questionable for the goal, meets Ritchie\u2019s corner. 36 min: \u201cSpurs go behind again with Eriksen &amp; Vertonghen on the bench. Lousy defending &amp; poor creativity. What exactly is Pochettino trying to prove?\u201d writes Mike Nagle. They could certainly do with those two as things stand. 34 min: Now Lamela clips a fine cross in from the left and Dummett makes a vital intervention by getting his head to the ball just ahead of Moura. Spurs might have woken up. 33 min: That\u2019s a shot though! Walker-Peters dinks to the far post and Son volleys hard, into the ground and up, forcing a parry from Dubravka. The volume goes up a notch. 32 min: Tottenham have not had a goal attempt yet, which tells you everything about how this has gone for them. They scream for a spot kick again after Rose runs past Ritchie and falls, but they won\u2019t get that either. 30 min: Steve Bruce \u2013 local hero! Fair play to Newcastle here, they\u2019ve not been seriously threatened yet and have created the game\u2019s two big chances when they\u2019ve marauded forward. They buried the second and Spurs have a problem. Now then! Newcastle manage a sustained spell of confident possession, with Spurs doing little or nothing to press the ball. They are made to pay when Atsu, about 40 yards out and to the left, chips a marvellous pass over the defence that Joelinton brings down expertly and lashes low past Lloris for his first Newcastle goal! 25 min: Spurs win a corner at the other end and now the game has mustered a bit of tempo. That quickly dies down when Dubravka easily claims Lamela\u2019s kick. 23 min: Close from Longstaff! Joelinton holds the ball up well and suddenly Newcastle are flooding towards the box. Longstaff has two men screaming for it to his left but, in fairness, catches his angled effort superbly and Lloris is forced into a fine, acrobatic save. The corner comes to nothing but Newcastle packed a punch there! 23 min: I can already see, let\u2019s say, Isaac Hayden commenting after this finishes 0-0 that \u201cThe lads did a lot of work on shape this week\u201d. 21 min: Spurs want a penalty now, though, as Son bursts into the area and goes down under Schar\u2019s challenge. Dean rules that the defender got there first and there\u2019s no VAR intervention. So that is that. 20 min: Rose swings a nice cross beyond everyone, and it\u2019s really as good as things have been so far. 18 min: Burnley are ahead at Wolves thanks to the absolutely-on-fire Ashley Barnes. 17 min: Looks as if he actually pulled up during what, on first viewing, looked a really sloppy bit of play in letting the ball run out. Think he\u2019s tweaked his hamstring and on comes Atsu. Not the full debut he\u2019d wanted. 15 min: It might have been the only glimpse we get of Saint-Maximin \u2013 he\u2019s in pain and it looks as if Atsu may come on ... 13 min: An early glimpse of Saint-Maximin, who is found in a promising position on the left side of the box by Ritchie\u2019s quick free-kick ... and runs the ball over the byline. 11 min: Winks is booked for a shirt pull on Almiron in midfield, which looked entirely unnecessary. Don\u2019t throw Mike Dean any bones! 10 min: It\u2019s a slow start really, this. Spurs aren\u2019t quite moving the ball as quickly as they\u2019d like and Newcastle so far look much more disciplined than last week. You\u2019d expect that from a Bruce team really. 7 min: Spurs win their first corner, in front of that single-tier wall of fans. Eriksen Lamela swings it in; it\u2019s thudded behind for another, which is cleared by Joelinton. 5 min: Nothing of note has happened yet but it\u2019s fair to say that, despite their colour scheme, Newcastle won\u2019t be 1970s Holland here. 2 min: It\u2019s all Spurs in the early moments, amid blazing sunshine. I suspect Newcastle will be looking for counters here. Spurs kick off. Newcastle, in orange, have turned them around so the hosts will go left to right first. I should have mentioned, by the way, that Spurs\u2019 big summer signing Tanguy Ndombele is out with a thigh injury. So we won\u2019t be enjoying him shortly. It\u2019s been an afternoon of high sporting theatre and it\u2019s about to get better \u2013 your referee is Mike Dean and he\u2019s leading the teams out now. \u201cEriksen is generally considered amongst us Spurs fans as already gone or going. Poch is planning for life without him. Levy has already spent his transfer fee,\u201d writes Steve Porter. I\u2019ve heard that said by other Spurs supporters too ... but surely they wouldn\u2019t have spent that money without being sure of a sale? England have won the cricket! And it was *sensational*. But I\u2019ll leave that to Rob because we have some football to be getting on with and it\u2019s starting in about 15 ... The cricket is absolutely mesmerising sport. But anyway! I\u2019m also interested to hear Spurs fans and their takes on Eriksen. How vital is it that he stays? And is Pochettino right to take such a hard line with the player? He\u2019ll absolutely *seethe* if a late deal is done for Eriksen, surely. Saint-Maximin, the Newcastle winger, played under Patrick Vieira at Nice last season. From the little I\u2019ve seen, he can be pretty exciting but the end product isn\u2019t always there. Any Ligue 1 aficionados who have more to add, I\u2019d love to hear from you. Man City have won 3-1 but you are quite possibly watching the cricket. Oh and the cricket\u2019s going to the wire! Rob Smyth has England attempting the impossible and, my gosh, they\u2019re close ... Manchester City are 3-1 up at Bournemouth, who did at least score a wonderful free-kick through Harry Wilson. Catch the end with Ben Fisher and then I\u2019ll be back with you. Get your emails and tweets across, in the meantime \u2013 you know the drill! Spurs: Lloris; Walker-Peters, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Rose; Sissoko, Winks; Lamela, Son, Moura; Kane. Subs: Gazzaniga, Davies, Vertonghen, Dier, Skipp, Eriksen, Lo Celso. Newcastle: Dubravka; Krafth, Schar, Lascelles, Dummett; Ritchie, Hayden, Longstaff; Saint-Maximin; Almiron; Joelinton. Subs: Darlow, Manquillo, Fernandez, Willems, Shelvey, Atsu, Muto. Eriksen returns to the naughty step! But Son returns from his three-match ban. Saint-Maximin makes his first Newcastle start and Longstaff is back in, too. It\u2019s a stunning day up in north London. I should know, as I\u2019m writing this a hop, skip, jump from White Hart Lane. Spurs\u2019 new stadium will be gleaming for this one and let\u2019s hope we get entertainment to match. There was enough fun in the pre-match exchanges up at Newcastle, with Steve Bruce and, errrrr, Michael Chopra exchanging words. They\u2019ve had a stormy start and the defeat at Norwich was shambolic. Then again, Arsenal and Spurs either side of that is no easy task and is reminiscent of the fiendish first few weeks they had last time out. There is still time for Brucey to put it right. And Newcastle have done well recently at Spurs\u2019 previous venues, winning three times in a row at the old White Hart Lane and running them close both times at Wembley. So historically it\u2019s a tighter fixture than, on paper, this might look. There\u2019s a certain amount of pressure on Spurs, too. They had a scare against Aston Villa and got lucky when they drew up at Manchester City. The Christian Eriksen situation really isn\u2019t helping and that\u2019s about to enter its crunch week. It\u2019s hard not to think this might be a season when they plateau a bit \u2013 but perhaps they\u2019re about to prove that notion absolutely daft! Lots to look out for in any case. Can Newcastle get off the mark? Will Spurs put themselves among the early contenders? Stay tuned for all this and, no doubt, much more!",

After what must rank among the most satisfying victories of his long managerial career, Bruce could reflect on having done just that.</p> <p>Newcastle rode their luck in the closing stages, as Spurs belatedly summoned some punch in the final third, notably when Jamaal Lascelles slipped and appeared to impede Harry Kane as he went to ground inside the area.

After all the criticism, particularly about his tactics, that had to feel good. His players kept Spurs at arm\u2019s length for much of the game, restricting them to precious few clear chances, but equally they flickered when playing through Joelinton on the counterattack.</p> <p>Spurs felt aggrieved at the denial of the penalty but this was no hard-luck story.

      "bodyText": "Insulting criticism. Complete lies. An over-sensationalised mini-crisis. Steve Bruce\u2019s soundbites had been heavy on emotion in the countdown to this trip to Tottenham, a portrait of a manager determined to fight back after Newcastle\u2019s early-season losses to Arsenal and Norwich. After what must rank among the most satisfying victories of his long managerial career, Bruce could reflect on having done just that. Newcastle rode their luck in the closing stages, as Spurs belatedly summoned some punch in the final third, notably when Jamaal Lascelles slipped and appeared to impede Harry Kane as he went to ground inside the area. In came VAR and Spurs sensed the reprieve of a penalty. The technology had saved them at Manchester City last Saturday, preserving a point for them when Gabriel Jesus\u2019s late effort was disallowed, but on this occasion it was not their friend. Pochettino had infamously clashed with the referee, Mike Dean, at Burnley last season and it was easy to imagine his feelings at that point. Lascelles got away with it, as Newcastle did when Lucas Moura lifted a gilt-edged opportunity high from Moussa Sissoko\u2019s cross. But across the piece Newcastle did enough to merit the result that kickstarted Bruce\u2019s tenure at his hometown club and sparked wild celebrations inside the visiting enclosure. Joelinton, the \u00a340m signing from Hoffenheim, was the hero, his slick first-half finish proving the difference. He had nothing left in the tank towards the end, like some of his colleagues, but before that he had offered plenty of encouragement with his all-round game. Bruce tweaked his system, moving to 3-4-3 or, more accurately, 5-4-1, and he was rewarded. After all the criticism, particularly about his tactics, that had to feel good. His players kept Spurs at arm\u2019s length for much of the game, restricting them to precious few clear chances, but equally they flickered when playing through Joelinton on the counterattack. Spurs felt aggrieved at the denial of the penalty but this was no hard-luck story. Apart from the late push they could not get into their stride. For too long their movement was turgid, their patterns predictable. Where was the creative spark? It was supposed to come from \u00c9rik Lamela in the No 10 role but he laboured to find it. Christian Eriksen kicked his heels on the bench until after the hour mark. They simply could not turn possession into penetration. Joelinton\u2019s hold-up play was easy on the eye, coupled with his balance and awareness of teammates, and he advertised his threat before he scored the goal, ushering in Sean Longstaff after an intelligent run. Longstaff might have crossed but instead he extended Hugo Lloris with a firm shot. Joelinton\u2019s goal was a case study in simplicity, although it owed much to Davinson S\u00e1nchez switching off and failing to notice the Newcastle No 9 stealing yards behind him in the centre.

Recent visitors to the Louvre report that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/mona-lisa-fans-face-scandalous-queues-after-portrait-relocated\" title=\"\">tourists can now spend only a minute</a> in front of the Mona Lisa before being asked to move on. Much of that time, for some of them, is spent taking photographs not even of the painting but of themselves with the painting in the background.</p> <p>One view is that we have democratised tourism and gallery-going so much that we have made it effectively impossible to appreciate what we\u2019ve travelled to see. In this oversubscribed society, experience becomes a commodity like any other. There are queues to climb Everest as well as to see famous paintings. Leisure, thus conceived, is hard labour, and returning to work becomes a well-earned break from the ordeal.</p> <p>What gets lost in this industrialised haste is the quality of looking. Consider an extreme example, the late philosopher Richard Wollheim. When he visited the Louvre he could spent as much as <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v10/n04/nicholas-penny/meltings\" title=\"\">four hours sitting before a painting</a>. The first hour, he claimed, was necessary for misperceptions to be eliminated. It was only then that the picture would begin to disclose itself. This seems unthinkable today, but it is still possible to organise. Even in the busiest museums there are many rooms and many pictures worth hours of contemplation which the crowds largely ignore. Sometimes the largest throngs are partly the products of bad management and crowd control; the Mona Lisa is such a hurried experience today partly because the museum is being reorganised, so it is in a temporary room. The Uffizi in Florence, another site of cultural pilgrimage, has cut its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61380d42-c33b-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9\" title=\"\">entry queues</a> down to seven minutes by clever management. And there are some forms of art, those designed to be spectacles as well as objects of contemplation, which can work perfectly well in the face of huge crowds.</p> <p>Olafur Eliasson\u2019s current Tate Modern show, for instance, might seem nothing more than an entertainment, overrun as it is with toddlers romping in fog rooms and spray mist installations as their parents tut-tut over anyone who dares interpose themselves between their offspring and their snapping phones. But it\u2019s more than that: where Eliasson is at his most entertaining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/09/olafur-eliasson-review-tate-modern-london\" title=\"\">he is at his most serious too</a>, and his disorienting installations bring home something of the reality of the destructive effects we are having on the planet \u2013 not least what we are <a href=\"https://olafureliasson.net/archive/artwork/WEK101386/the-glacier-series\" title=\"\">doing to the glaciers</a> of Eliasson\u2019s beloved Iceland. The aim is to make us agents as much as spectators.</p> <p>Marcel Proust, another lover of the Louvre, <a href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/paintings-in-proust-vol-1-swanns-way/\" title=\"\">wrote</a>: \u201cIt is only through art that we can escape from ourselves and know how another person sees a universe which is not the same as our own and whose landscapes would otherwise have remained as unknown as any there may be on the moon.\u201d If any art remains worth seeing, it must lead us to such escapes. But a minute in front of a painting in a hurried, harried crowd won\u2019t do that.</p>",

One view is that we have democratised tourism and gallery-going so much that we have made it effectively impossible to appreciate what we\u2019ve travelled to see. In this oversubscribed society, experience becomes a commodity like any other. There are queues to climb Everest as well as to see famous paintings. Leisure, thus conceived, is hard labour, and returning to work becomes a well-earned break from the ordeal. What gets lost in this industrialised haste is the quality of looking. Consider an extreme example, the late philosopher Richard Wollheim. When he visited the Louvre he could spent as much as four hours sitting before a painting. The first hour, he claimed, was necessary for misperceptions to be eliminated. It was only then that the picture would begin to disclose itself. This seems unthinkable today, but it is still possible to organise. Even in the busiest museums there are many rooms and many pictures worth hours of contemplation which the crowds largely ignore. Sometimes the largest throngs are partly the products of bad management and crowd control; the Mona Lisa is such a hurried experience today partly because the museum is being reorganised, so it is in a temporary room. The Uffizi in Florence, another site of cultural pilgrimage, has cut its entry queues down to seven minutes by clever management. And there are some forms of art, those designed to be spectacles as well as objects of contemplation, which can work perfectly well in the face of huge crowds. Olafur Eliasson\u2019s current Tate Modern show, for instance, might seem nothing more than an entertainment, overrun as it is with toddlers romping in fog rooms and spray mist installations as their parents tut-tut over anyone who dares interpose themselves between their offspring and their snapping phones. But it\u2019s more than that: where Eliasson is at his most entertaining, he is at his most serious too, and his disorienting installations bring home something of the reality of the destructive effects we are having on the planet \u2013 not least what we are doing to the glaciers of Eliasson\u2019s beloved Iceland. The aim is to make us agents as much as spectators. Marcel Proust, another lover of the Louvre, wrote: \u201cIt is only through art that we can escape from ourselves and know how another person sees a universe which is not the same as our own and whose landscapes would otherwise have remained as unknown as any there may be on the moon.\u201d If any art remains worth seeing, it must lead us to such escapes. But a minute in front of a painting in a hurried, harried crowd won\u2019t do that.",

Fans were at fever pitch hours before Netflix made the announcement when it was discovered that a \u201cmovie card\u201d for the film could be found on the streaming service\u2019s official site, confirming the project\u2019s existence after years of speculation. But Netflix has provided zero plot spoilers. \u201cIn the wake of his dramatic escape from captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge some kind of future,\u201d it said. The film is called El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. It was written and directed by the show\u2019s creator Vince Gilligan and will be released on Netflix on 11 October. It is also expected to be broadcast on AMC, the cable network that first brought the show to screens from 2008-2013. It will be the first time we have seen Pinkman since he sped off-screen in a stolen Chevrolet El Camino having just been rescued from an Aryan Brotherhood gang by his one-time partner Walter White (Bryan Cranston). To fans, that episode seemed like a full stop: with drug kingpin White collapsing on the floor of his Quonset hut-turned-meth lab just moments before police burst in with guns drawn as the credits started to roll, fans believed this would be the last time they would see many of the show\u2019s most iconic characters. In an interview, Aaron Paul made it clear that the film was as much a revelation to him as it would be to fans of the show as he believed he had said goodbye to the Breaking Bad universe after that finale. \u201cIt was a hard, emotional thing for all of us,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd when the finale happened, we all got together and hugged it out and said \u2018I love you\u2019.

In fact they haven\u2019t caught very many of those and instead caught little minnows like myself.\u201d</p> <p>According to one estimate mentioned in the European Parliament last year, there are between 300,000 and 500,000 accidental Americans in the EU. It is not clear how many are in the UK, though numbers are thought to be similar to France, where 40,000 citizens are affected.</p> <p>Many in the UK have reached out to prime minister Boris Johnson, who had his own run-in with the US tax authority back in 2014. Johnson, who was born in New York but left when he was five years old, gave up his American citizenship after the US tried to tax him on the sale of his home in Islington, north London \u2013 a move he called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/08/boris-johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-record-2016-uk-foreign-secretary\">absolutely outrageous</a>\u201d, though he was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/22/boris-johnson-settles-us-tax-demand\">reported to have settled the demand</a>.</p> <p>Thomas Carpenter, 50, who works in telecoms, penned a letter to Johnson in 2018 after online trading service Interactive Investor froze his Isa savings account, leaving \u00a3100,000 trapped for nearly four months. Interactive Investor said: \u201cWe try not to resort to blocking people\u2019s accounts in these scenarios, but we are also in a difficult position under both Fatca and QI [qualified intermediary] regulations.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister is now facing pressure from the Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill, who wrote to him earlier this month on behalf of one of her constituents. She highlighted the financial burden, with accidental Americans forced to pay hundreds of pounds in extra tax each year or shoulder the $2,000-plus bill of renouncing citizenship.</p> <p>The pensioner in Cambridge told the Guardian she spent \u00a311,300 of her retirement funds to cover the cost of a specialist accountant who helped her obtain a social security number, file five years of back taxes and declare all her assets. The bill also included the cost of her renouncing her citizenship.</p> <p>Others still hold citizenship, but told the Guardian they fear being hunted down for taxes they never knew they owed.</p> <p>\u201cThe US is our greatest ally, but do we want them compelling random citizens to transfer over thousands of pounds into another tax system?\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine any other country that could get away with that.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2019 to add that Johnson was later reported to have settled the US tax demand. It was further amended on 28 August 2019 to attribute the estimated figure for accidental Americans in the EU to a mention in the European Parliament and not to the European Banking Federation as an earlier version had it.</p>",

Banks and investment platforms are in a race against time to uncover information about any remaining dual nationals on their customer roster before the end of 2019, when a grace period for banks expires. The pensioner in Cambridge said accidental Americans like herself should not be the target of Fatca trawls of foreign bank accounts: \u201cIt was a big net cast to catch these big fish, these sharks, hiding American money abroad. In fact they haven\u2019t caught very many of those and instead caught little minnows like myself.\u201d According to one estimate mentioned in the European Parliament last year, there are between 300,000 and 500,000 accidental Americans in the EU. It is not clear how many are in the UK, though numbers are thought to be similar to France, where 40,000 citizens are affected. Many in the UK have reached out to prime minister Boris Johnson, who had his own run-in with the US tax authority back in 2014. Johnson, who was born in New York but left when he was five years old, gave up his American citizenship after the US tried to tax him on the sale of his home in Islington, north London \u2013 a move he called \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d, though he was later reported to have settled the demand. Thomas Carpenter, 50, who works in telecoms, penned a letter to Johnson in 2018 after online trading service Interactive Investor froze his Isa savings account, leaving \u00a3100,000 trapped for nearly four months. Interactive Investor said: \u201cWe try not to resort to blocking people\u2019s accounts in these scenarios, but we are also in a difficult position under both Fatca and QI [qualified intermediary] regulations.\u201d The prime minister is now facing pressure from the Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill, who wrote to him earlier this month on behalf of one of her constituents. She highlighted the financial burden, with accidental Americans forced to pay hundreds of pounds in extra tax each year or shoulder the $2,000-plus bill of renouncing citizenship. The pensioner in Cambridge told the Guardian she spent \u00a311,300 of her retirement funds to cover the cost of a specialist accountant who helped her obtain a social security number, file five years of back taxes and declare all her assets. The bill also included the cost of her renouncing her citizenship. Others still hold citizenship, but told the Guardian they fear being hunted down for taxes they never knew they owed. \u201cThe US is our greatest ally, but do we want them compelling random citizens to transfer over thousands of pounds into another tax system?\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine any other country that could get away with that.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2019 to add that Johnson was later reported to have settled the US tax demand. It was further amended on 28 August 2019 to attribute the estimated figure for accidental Americans in the EU to a mention in the European Parliament and not to the European Banking Federation as an earlier version had it.",

Andrew and Anna Malova, then 27, were among nine people on Epstein\u2019s plane for a trip from the US Virgin Islands to Florida in February 1999, according to flight logs. Malova was later jailed in the US for failing to comply with a court-ordered programme relating to her use of prescription painkillers. The discovery of the flight added to pressure on Andrew over his friendship with Epstein, who this month was found dead at 66 in his New York jail cell while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. The city medical examiner ruled the death a suicide. Andrew has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. He said in a statement on Saturday that he did not \u201csee, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort\u201d that led to Epstein\u2019s 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from an underage girl. The prince said it was a mistake to have continued seeing Epstein after that. The February 1999 flight, first reported by the Sunday Times, was recorded in logs kept by Epstein\u2019s pilots that were filed to a US court by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has alleged she was used as a sex slave by Epstein. The flight log was among almost 2,000 pages of records released by a federal judge in New York this month. It was missing from the notorious 73 pages of previously released Epstein flight logs, some of which also named Andrew as a passenger. The group flew from St Thomas, the airport closest to Epstein\u2019s private island, Little St James, to Palm Beach in Florida, where Epstein had a mansion. The disgraced money manager is accused of abusing underage girls at both properties and other sites. There is no suggestion Malova or Andrew were involved in any wrongdoing during the trip. They and Epstein were joined on the flight by others including Epstein\u2019s close friend Ghislaine Maxwell, a daughter of the late financier Robert Maxwell who has been accused by several victims of assisting Epstein\u2019s abuse of girls.

And though most of their work was behind-the-scenes, in 1980 he was the <a href=\"https://www.lp.org/\" title=\"\">Libertarian party</a> candidate for vice-president of the US.</p> <p>Charles and David were two of the four sons of Fred and Mary (nee Robinson) Koch. Fred was an engineer who made his fortune from inventing an improved refining process to extract petrol from crude oil. His libertarian ideas came from the efforts of larger oil companies to stymie his firm\u2019s growth using government-regulated patent laws; his hatred of socialism came from his experience, after building refineries in Britain, of supervising the construction of the Soviet Union\u2019s largest installation.</p> <p>When the Russians decided they could proceed on their own, Fred turned to Nazi Germany, with whom his firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/dark-money-review-nazi-oil-the-koch-brothers-and-a-rightwing-revolution\" title=\"\">Winkler-Koch</a> collaborated from 1934 on building refineries. In 1958 he was a founding member of the ultra-rightwing <a href=\"https://www.jbs.org/\" title=\"\">John Birch Society</a>, dedicated to fighting the infiltration of American politics by communists, among whose number it identified the Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower.</p> <p>David was born in Wichita. Fred was a harsh father, encouraging competition among his sons, from which Charles emerged as the undisputed leader, and David his second, while <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-koch/#51a3a1303d70\" title=\"\">David\u2019s twin, William</a>, fell behind and<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/05/frederick-koch-brothers\" title=\"\"> the eldest son, Frederick</a>, described as being most like their mother, a Wellesey College graduate with artistic interests, was the odd one out.</p> <p>They were subjected to frequent corporal punishment, as well as hard labour on the family farm. David went to Deerfield academy, in Massachusetts, and then, like his father and two of his brothers, took an engineering degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where David, 6ft 5in tall, played basketball, setting an MIT scoring record with 41 points in one game.</p> <p>After adding a master\u2019s degree in 1963, he worked for engineering companies in Cambridge and New York. When Fred Sr died in 1967, Charles replaced him as chairman and chief executive of the renamed Koch Industries, and in 1970 David joined to open a New York office. In 1979 David became president of Koch Engineering, later Koch Chemical Technology, and in 1981 became number two to Charles as executive vice-president of Koch Industries.</p> <p>No longer bound to his father\u2019s political dictates, David broke with the John Birch Society. Along with Charles, he attended the Freedom School, which advocated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world\" title=\"\">the free-market theories of Friedrich Hayek</a>, which were such an influence on Thatcherism in the UK. Although he and Ed Clark, the Libertarian candidate for president in 1980, attracted only 1.1% of the vote, the Kochs\u2019 focus on politics led to a family feud that lasted for 20 years.</p> <p>Before their father\u2019s death, William is said to have recalled participating with Charles and David in an attempt to blackmail their oldest brother into relinquishing his inheritance by threatening to tell their father he was gay, which he denied. William regretted his actions, and in 1980 he and Frederick sued for control of the company, alleging Charles and David\u2019s political interests were damaging its business.</p> <p>In 1983 they settled for a buyout of $1.1bn, but in 1985 they sued again, claiming their brothers had undervalued the company\u2019s worth in the settlement. The case was eventually settled in Charles and David\u2019s favour in 1999, but not until 2001 were they publicly reconciled.</p> <p>Fred Sr\u2019s will required the sons to give the interest on their inheritance to charity; thus their political donations went to organisations structured as tax-exempt charities or academic institutions.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Richard Fink, at the Koch-funded <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/\" title=\"\">Cato Institute</a>, developed <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/10/the-koch-networks-integrated-strategy-for-social-transformation/\" title=\"\">a three-stage plan for activism</a>. It started with the creation of an intellectual platform for ideas, at places they funded such as George Mason University. Then thinktanks would turn those ideas into policies to be brought to political reality by advocacy groups, which David called \u201ca sales force\u201d.</p> <p>Although the Kochs strongly denied any connection, the nascent Tea Party movement was backed by another Koch-funded group, <a href=\"https://americansforprosperity.org/\" title=\"\">Americans for Prosperity</a>. This worked in parallel with the <a href=\"https://www.alec.org/\" title=\"\">American Legislative Exchange Council</a>, through which the Kochs funded campaigns for Republican control of state legislatures.</p> <p>In 1991, David narrowly escaped death as a passenger on a US Air jet that collided with a small commuter plane while landing at Los Angeles airport, killing 34 people. In 1992 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, for which he received treatment for many years. His private life, which had been compared with Hugh Hefner\u2019s, slowed down, and in 1996 he married Julia Flesher, an assistant at the Adolfo fashion brand.</p> <p>Spurred by court decisions overturning limits on political spending, the Kochs became power brokers in Republican politics. Bitterly opposed to President Barack Obama, they poured money into the 2010 Congressional elections, and when the Republican John Boehner took the gavel as Speaker of the House in 2011, David was present in his office.</p> <p>Their influence was revealed when Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, took a phone call from a Koch representative, agreeing to a plan to remove collective bargaining from state employees. The caller was an impostor who made the tape public.</p> <p>In the 2016 presidential campaign, the Kochs spent nearly $1bn on Republican candidates, but not on Donald Trump, whose protectionism was antithetical to their beliefs. Though David attended the victory party at Mar-a-Lago after Trump\u2019s election, their criticism of the new president saw Trump label them \u201cnot true Republicans\u201d, calling them \u201ca total joke in Republican circles and highly overrated\u201d. Like many Trump pronouncements, it downplayed the reality of the situation.</p> <p>Koch is survived by his wife, his sons, David Jr and John, his daughter, Mary, and his brothers.</p> <p>\u2022 David Koch, businessman and political donor, born 3 May 1940; died 23 August 2019</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2019, to clarify David Koch\u2019s links to the John Birch Society and the Freedom School.</p>",

After adding a master\u2019s degree in 1963, he worked for engineering companies in Cambridge and New York. When Fred Sr died in 1967, Charles replaced him as chairman and chief executive of the renamed Koch Industries, and in 1970 David joined to open a New York office. In 1979 David became president of Koch Engineering, later Koch Chemical Technology, and in 1981 became number two to Charles as executive vice-president of Koch Industries. No longer bound to his father\u2019s political dictates, David broke with the John Birch Society. Along with Charles, he attended the Freedom School, which advocated the free-market theories of Friedrich Hayek, which were such an influence on Thatcherism in the UK. Although he and Ed Clark, the Libertarian candidate for president in 1980, attracted only 1.1% of the vote, the Kochs\u2019 focus on politics led to a family feud that lasted for 20 years. Before their father\u2019s death, William is said to have recalled participating with Charles and David in an attempt to blackmail their oldest brother into relinquishing his inheritance by threatening to tell their father he was gay, which he denied. William regretted his actions, and in 1980 he and Frederick sued for control of the company, alleging Charles and David\u2019s political interests were damaging its business. In 1983 they settled for a buyout of $1.1bn, but in 1985 they sued again, claiming their brothers had undervalued the company\u2019s worth in the settlement. The case was eventually settled in Charles and David\u2019s favour in 1999, but not until 2001 were they publicly reconciled. Fred Sr\u2019s will required the sons to give the interest on their inheritance to charity; thus their political donations went to organisations structured as tax-exempt charities or academic institutions. In the 1980s, Richard Fink, at the Koch-funded Cato Institute, developed a three-stage plan for activism. It started with the creation of an intellectual platform for ideas, at places they funded such as George Mason University. Then thinktanks would turn those ideas into policies to be brought to political reality by advocacy groups, which David called \u201ca sales force\u201d. Although the Kochs strongly denied any connection, the nascent Tea Party movement was backed by another Koch-funded group, Americans for Prosperity. This worked in parallel with the American Legislative Exchange Council, through which the Kochs funded campaigns for Republican control of state legislatures. In 1991, David narrowly escaped death as a passenger on a US Air jet that collided with a small commuter plane while landing at Los Angeles airport, killing 34 people. In 1992 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, for which he received treatment for many years. His private life, which had been compared with Hugh Hefner\u2019s, slowed down, and in 1996 he married Julia Flesher, an assistant at the Adolfo fashion brand. Spurred by court decisions overturning limits on political spending, the Kochs became power brokers in Republican politics. Bitterly opposed to President Barack Obama, they poured money into the 2010 Congressional elections, and when the Republican John Boehner took the gavel as Speaker of the House in 2011, David was present in his office. Their influence was revealed when Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, took a phone call from a Koch representative, agreeing to a plan to remove collective bargaining from state employees. The caller was an impostor who made the tape public. In the 2016 presidential campaign, the Kochs spent nearly $1bn on Republican candidates, but not on Donald Trump, whose protectionism was antithetical to their beliefs. Though David attended the victory party at Mar-a-Lago after Trump\u2019s election, their criticism of the new president saw Trump label them \u201cnot true Republicans\u201d, calling them \u201ca total joke in Republican circles and highly overrated\u201d. Like many Trump pronouncements, it downplayed the reality of the situation. Koch is survived by his wife, his sons, David Jr and John, his daughter, Mary, and his brothers. \u2022 David Koch, businessman and political donor, born 3 May 1940; died 23 August 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2019, to clarify David Koch\u2019s links to the John Birch Society and the Freedom School.",

      "body": "<p>Philip Inman asserts that \u201cHS2 has been 15 years in the making and is the best compromise option the transport ministry and its advisers could come up with for improving the UK\u2019s transport system\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/21/hs2-chosen-best-compromise-go-ahead-in-full-speed-network\" title=\"\">Business view</a>, 22 August). HS2\u2019s problem is that it is uncompromising: it was designed to run very fast, and therefore in an almost straight line, worsening its damage to the landscape, failing to reach the centres of many cities or Scotland, and badly connected with the rest of the railway network.</p> <p>More recent compromises to address those weaknesses, such as smaller loading gauge, shorter trains that can also run on existing routes, and trams and \u201cpeople-movers\u201d to take passengers from its stations to where they actually want to go, have worsened HS2\u2019s already fragile economics. Let us hope the review panel takes a broader view of how transport needs between city regions and within them can sustainably be met, recommends forgetting HS2 and starts work on smaller-scale, lower-risk alternatives that could improve more people\u2019s journeys sooner and more efficiently.<br><strong>James Mackay</strong><br><em>Warwick</em></p> <p>\u2022 One of the reasons the costs of HS2 have ballooned is the amount of tunnelling proposed under the home counties. If HS2 were to be built as a normal civil engineering project \u2013 like, say, a motorway \u2013 more of the route would be above ground and the costs would fall dramatically. The rule of thumb is that putting anything underground increases the cost by tenfold.</p> <p>This would benefit the north, whose economy needs a long-term stimulus. But it would anger the well-heeled folk who see themselves as getting nothing out of HS2. So here\u2019s an alternative: take over the London-Aylesbury route that feeds into an abandoned line that still points north (it used to run to Sheffield and Manchester) and use that as the HS2 route instead. It would mean no suburban trains into London, but then they could all drive instead on the new motorway that would doubtless have to be built as a result.<br><strong>Alan Whitehouse</strong><br><em>Thornton le Dale, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In your coverage of the review of the HS2 high-speed rail scheme and the search for \u201cclear evidence\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/21/hs2-review-launched-over-whether-rail-project-should-proceed\" title=\"\">HS2 in doubt as key critic begins review of project</a>, 22 August), I trust that you will follow up on the conclusions and recommendations of the 2014 environmental audit select committee report, HS2 and the Environment. Not only should the government aim higher than simply striving for no net biodiversity loss, but it should also factor into the final appraisal the true costs of processes to address environmental risks and prevent or mitigate them.</p> <p>Our report also called on the government to establish detailed costings for monitoring and reporting, and for environmental protections over a 60-year period following the start of construction. In the absence of a formal strategic environmental assessment process for HS2, there is now an opportunity to place a value on environmental considerations too.<br><strong>Joan Walley</strong><br><em>Chair</em><em>, environmental audit select committee, 2010-</em><em>15</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your report overlooks one of the greatest benefits of HS2. The old railways will be able to carry a lot more freight, enabling goods from the north to access southern ports more easily, and reducing the number of polluting lorries on the roads. This will in turn be a huge help towards climate targets. A lot of the costs should be offset in this way. <br><strong>Celia Boden</strong><br><em>Tiverton, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 The kangaroo court set up to try to condemn HS2 will also condemn Britain to a future in the slow lane. It makes sense to plan for the zero-carbon future that must come. We will simply not be able to afford the massive carbon emissions that come from short-haul flights. With a decarbonised electricity supply, high-speed rail in Britain could be as quick as flying, but with zero carbon emissions. While we argue about a measly 140 miles from London to Birmingham, France and Italy are going ahead with linking their extensive high-speed rail networks with a new tunnel through the Alps that will cut the Paris-Milan journey time from seven hours to three. Now who\u2019s thinking strategically?<br><strong>Mick Shaw</strong><br><em>Ulverston, Cumbria</em></p> <p>\u2022 Britain\u2019s motorway network was not constructed by tinkering with the roundabouts and crossroads on A roads. Just like the motorways, HS2 is about capacity, not just speed, although speed contributes to capacity. The southern end of the west coast mainline is so full that not enough trains can stop for commuters at stations like Milton Keyes, as they\u2019d get in the way of the trains behind them. As for freight, I\u2019m sure Stop HS2 campaigners would also like to get lorry loads off the roads and on to the tracks. Let\u2019s create the space for them.<br><strong>Rob Harris</strong><br><em>Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Ruskin would have had it right on the utility of HS2. To paraphrase: \u201cEvery fool in London could be at Birmingham, saving half an hour, and every fool in Birmingham at London.\u201d His hated railway line in Monsal Dale is now a footpath and cycleway.<br><strong>Joe Oldaker</strong><br><em>Nuneaton, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The decision to review HS2 is a welcome indication that the government is not afraid to kill off projects that have gone off the rails. Its costs are escalating out of control such that it can never recover its investment. It does not address the need for much more rail capacity to relieve chronic congestion and take cars off the road, not to transport relatively few businesspeople rapidly at high prices. A review of the Hinkley Point C nuclear project \u2013 also with costs out of control and unable to meet the need for low-cost, low-carbon electricity \u2013 should be carried out.</p> <p>The money already spent on these mega-projects is irrelevant to decision-making. The issues are whether the remaining cost can be recovered and whether the estimates of the remaining costs are reliable. The money spent cannot be recovered and, galling as this waste of public money would be, it has to be written off if carrying on would be throwing good money after bad.</p> <p>The estimate for HS2 is \u00a355.6bn compared to the original budget of \u00a332bn with \u00a37.4bn already spent. The 2017 estimate for Hinkley was \u00a320bn compared to the 2012 estimates of \u00a312bn. It is not clear how much EDF has spent to date but given that construction on the first reactor started in December 2018, it can only be a small fraction of the total cost, and an even smaller fraction of the \u00a350bn that Hinkley will add to consumer bills over its lifetime.<br><strong>Professor Steve Thomas</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor of energy policy, University of Greenwich</em></p>",

HS2\u2019s problem is that it is uncompromising: it was designed to run very fast, and therefore in an almost straight line, worsening its damage to the landscape, failing to reach the centres of many cities or Scotland, and badly connected with the rest of the railway network. More recent compromises to address those weaknesses, such as smaller loading gauge, shorter trains that can also run on existing routes, and trams and \u201cpeople-movers\u201d to take passengers from its stations to where they actually want to go, have worsened HS2\u2019s already fragile economics. Let us hope the review panel takes a broader view of how transport needs between city regions and within them can sustainably be met, recommends forgetting HS2 and starts work on smaller-scale, lower-risk alternatives that could improve more people\u2019s journeys sooner and more efficiently. James Mackay Warwick \u2022 One of the reasons the costs of HS2 have ballooned is the amount of tunnelling proposed under the home counties. If HS2 were to be built as a normal civil engineering project \u2013 like, say, a motorway \u2013 more of the route would be above ground and the costs would fall dramatically. The rule of thumb is that putting anything underground increases the cost by tenfold. This would benefit the north, whose economy needs a long-term stimulus. But it would anger the well-heeled folk who see themselves as getting nothing out of HS2. So here\u2019s an alternative: take over the London-Aylesbury route that feeds into an abandoned line that still points north (it used to run to Sheffield and Manchester) and use that as the HS2 route instead. It would mean no suburban trains into London, but then they could all drive instead on the new motorway that would doubtless have to be built as a result. Alan Whitehouse Thornton le Dale, North Yorkshire \u2022 In your coverage of the review of the HS2 high-speed rail scheme and the search for \u201cclear evidence\u201d (HS2 in doubt as key critic begins review of project, 22 August), I trust that you will follow up on the conclusions and recommendations of the 2014 environmental audit select committee report, HS2 and the Environment. Not only should the government aim higher than simply striving for no net biodiversity loss, but it should also factor into the final appraisal the true costs of processes to address environmental risks and prevent or mitigate them. Our report also called on the government to establish detailed costings for monitoring and reporting, and for environmental protections over a 60-year period following the start of construction. In the absence of a formal strategic environmental assessment process for HS2, there is now an opportunity to place a value on environmental considerations too. Joan Walley Chair, environmental audit select committee, 2010-15 \u2022 Your report overlooks one of the greatest benefits of HS2. The old railways will be able to carry a lot more freight, enabling goods from the north to access southern ports more easily, and reducing the number of polluting lorries on the roads. This will in turn be a huge help towards climate targets. A lot of the costs should be offset in this way. Celia Boden Tiverton, Devon \u2022 The kangaroo court set up to try to condemn HS2 will also condemn Britain to a future in the slow lane. It makes sense to plan for the zero-carbon future that must come. We will simply not be able to afford the massive carbon emissions that come from short-haul flights. With a decarbonised electricity supply, high-speed rail in Britain could be as quick as flying, but with zero carbon emissions. While we argue about a measly 140 miles from London to Birmingham, France and Italy are going ahead with linking their extensive high-speed rail networks with a new tunnel through the Alps that will cut the Paris-Milan journey time from seven hours to three. Now who\u2019s thinking strategically? Mick Shaw Ulverston, Cumbria \u2022 Britain\u2019s motorway network was not constructed by tinkering with the roundabouts and crossroads on A roads. Just like the motorways, HS2 is about capacity, not just speed, although speed contributes to capacity. The southern end of the west coast mainline is so full that not enough trains can stop for commuters at stations like Milton Keyes, as they\u2019d get in the way of the trains behind them. As for freight, I\u2019m sure Stop HS2 campaigners would also like to get lorry loads off the roads and on to the tracks. Let\u2019s create the space for them. Rob Harris Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire \u2022 John Ruskin would have had it right on the utility of HS2. To paraphrase: \u201cEvery fool in London could be at Birmingham, saving half an hour, and every fool in Birmingham at London.\u201d His hated railway line in Monsal Dale is now a footpath and cycleway. Joe Oldaker Nuneaton, Warwickshire \u2022 The decision to review HS2 is a welcome indication that the government is not afraid to kill off projects that have gone off the rails. Its costs are escalating out of control such that it can never recover its investment. It does not address the need for much more rail capacity to relieve chronic congestion and take cars off the road, not to transport relatively few businesspeople rapidly at high prices. A review of the Hinkley Point C nuclear project \u2013 also with costs out of control and unable to meet the need for low-cost, low-carbon electricity \u2013 should be carried out. The money already spent on these mega-projects is irrelevant to decision-making. The issues are whether the remaining cost can be recovered and whether the estimates of the remaining costs are reliable. The money spent cannot be recovered and, galling as this waste of public money would be, it has to be written off if carrying on would be throwing good money after bad. The estimate for HS2 is \u00a355.6bn compared to the original budget of \u00a332bn with \u00a37.4bn already spent. The 2017 estimate for Hinkley was \u00a320bn compared to the 2012 estimates of \u00a312bn. It is not clear how much EDF has spent to date but given that construction on the first reactor started in December 2018, it can only be a small fraction of the total cost, and an even smaller fraction of the \u00a350bn that Hinkley will add to consumer bills over its lifetime.

Jonny\u2019s positive approach to batting against the new ball is England\u2019s best chance; and also means Australia are always in with a chance of breaking through.

If you\u2019re Australian, are you toey? If you\u2019re English, dare you dream? </p> \n  <p>In around an hour from now Joe Root (75*) and Ben Stokes (2*) will stride out to the middle of a field in Leeds in pursuit of the 203 runs England require to pull off one of the most incredible victories in the long history of Test cricket. They have seven wickets with which to complete the heist after suffering the ignominy of a first-innings total of 67. For the improbable to occur all manner of records require breaking. But this is Headingley, the crucible of so many previously unthinkable accomplishments.</p> \n  <p>Commonsense analysis would say Australia are only eight overs from a new ball and their high-quality attack contains four world class, and crucially, patient bowlers. They will have access to a day four pitch that will aid the pacemen with the pristine Dukes and then Nathan Lyon once the ball has aged. No matter how plausible the maths become teams simply don\u2019t chase over 300 in the fourth innings very often. </p> \n  <p>But it is days like today that keep us returning to Test cricket. A day pregnant with possibility. A day that could end with Australians gambolling across the Headingley outfield celebrating the retention of the Ashes or an Englishman or two leaping in delirium with bats raised saluting an unlikely triumph. One way or the other history will be made. </p> \n  <p>If you don\u2019t know the drill yet, I am around for an hour or so to set the scene but as play begins Geoff Lemon will join the fray.

      "bodyText": "And more further reading \u2026 Geoff Lemon is being optimistic ... Tim Paine reflects on the loss ... A good innings ... Ben Stokes has spoken ... I\u2019m going to wrap the blog up, as there\u2019s plenty to do for tomorrow\u2019s paper. Thanks for your company and emails during another staggering Sunday of cricket. Bye! Some more tributes to an astonishing human being Ricky Ponting \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen anything better than that on a Test ground.\u201d Mike Atherton \u201cIt has to be right up there with the greatest English Test innings. It was a combination of all kinds of things: craft, skill, versatility, and most of all an over-my-dead-body attitude.\u201d Stokes finished with 135 not out from 219 balls, with 11 fours and nine sixes. At one stage he was three not out from 73 balls. He played with such intelligence, patience and flexibility. And then, when time was running out, he went nuclear. To quote Martin Tyler, I swear you\u2019ll never see anything like this ever again. The Man of the Match is Ben Stokes, and the crowd are giving him his 44341238th ovation of the day \u201cThis probably matches the World Cup. Wow. When you\u2019re out there and you know what\u2019s on the line, adrenaline keeps you going. There\u2019s nothing better than getting your team over the line. Today has been incredible\u2026 I\u2019m blabbering on here because I don\u2019t quite know what to say. It still hasn\u2019t sunk in. \u201cI didn\u2019t really start to get nervous until the target was in single figures. I didn\u2019t know what to do then! Before that it was pretty obvious. Those are the most crucial deliveries Jack Leach will face in his career, and credit to him for the way he played in such a hig-pressure situation.\u201d Read all about it, again and again and again And here\u2019s Joe Root \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed some freakish things throughout the summer. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d see something similar in these series! It was an incredible atmosphere in this ground. Test cricket is alive and kicking and the Ashes is alive and kicking. \u201cTo try to sum Ben\u2019s innings up in words is impossible. Outrageous batting, it really was. To be able to stay so calm and calculating was incredible. It\u2019s a fabulous lesson that you should never give up. \u201cThe fact [Jack] was so calm, able to take his glasses off and clean them between balls, shows he was very much in the moment. He did a fantastic job. I\u2019m still trying to get my head round it, to be honest.\u201d Tim Paine speaks \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take. But you\u2019ve got to tip your hat sometimes and Ben Stokes played an unbelievable innings. That\u2019s probably the best Test innings I\u2019ve seen, and he was too good for us. He bats really well with the tail; he controls the game. There are always things you can do differently, but cricket is a game of inches. It tests your character. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world. We\u2019re here to win the series and we\u2019ve got two opportunities to do that. We\u2019ve spoken a lot about playing on skill, not emotion, and I reiterated it to the boys just then: if we continue to do what we do, we think we\u2019ll be right in the mix in the last two Tests.\u201d Australia should have retained the Ashes today. This will really smart, and it\u2019s probably good for them that they have a break to process it all. They will also have Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne in the next Test. More from Ben Stokes \u201cWe had to win this game. We\u2019ve managed to keep our hopes alive of doing the double, and we\u2019ll take a lot of momentum into Manchester. It\u2019s nice that we\u2019ve got a bit of a break to recharge the batteries. I\u2019ll never forget that ovation. I have to take it all in, because I\u2019m not sure that will ever happen again.\u201d Ben Stokes is speaking to Ian Ward on Sky Sports \u201c[How the hell have you done that?] Erm... dunno \u2026 just never give up really. When Leachy came in, it was pretty clear what had to be done. I had to take five deliveries and him one. Leachy\u2019s done it before \u2013 he\u2019s our supernightwatchman, so I backed him. \u201cWhen we needed 60/70, I thought I had to really try and go. Yeah. I think I was just so in the zone of what I had to do. Yeah. Mate, I dunno.\u201d Ben Stokes, eh. Sometimes there\u2019s a man, sometimes there\u2019s a man... \u201cCan I just say that\u2019s the finest innings of 1 I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cWell done Jack Leach!\u201d He was so level-headed, the Penfold to Stokes\u2019s DangerMouse. Apart from that stupid attempted run that almost lost the game, but let\u2019s not dwell on that. \u201cWell, that\u2019s SPOTY sorted,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cSorry, Jofra.\u201d Selve, I love you. Ben Stokes bowled like a drain on Thursday and played the worst of many bad shots from the England batsmen on Friday. And then, in the second innings, he bowled 24.2 overs off the reel and smacked the most glorious 135 not out. His Test averages are fairly modest - 36 with the bat, 32 with the ball - but this match, like Headingley 1981 with Sir Ian Botham, is the ultimate proof of his greatness. With two Tests to play, it\u2019s England 1-1 Australia. That last hour was beyond ludicrous. Australia will be haunted by two moments in particular - the missed run-out and the brainless review, which meant they had nowhere to go when, sad to say, Joel Wilson made another poor decision. Justin Langer waits by the boundary, applauding Stokes before shaking his hand. The Aussies know class and ticker when they see it. Stokes has a long embrace with Joe Root. Stokes might have saved his job. Finally he leaves the field to the kind of standing ovation that is reserved for very few sportsmen. Stokes has his hands on his head, trying to take in what he has just achieved. He and Jack Leach - who deserves so much credit - added 76 for the last wicket. The England players all jump on Stokes, who is starting to register what has happened. Stokes slammed a short ball from Cummins through the covers for four and let out a primal roar that seemed to last about a minute. He has played one of the most immense innings in history - and he did it on the back of a 25-over spell with the ball. Never mind 258 in South Africa or even 84 not outin a World Cup final; this is and will forever be the innings of his life. Ben Stokes, I adore you. Test cricket &gt; everything else, ever. 125.3 overs: England 358-9 (need 1 to win; Stokes 131, Leach 1) Leach steals a single - England cannot lose the game! 125.2 overs: England 357-9 (need 2 to win; Stokes 131, Leach 0) Leach ducks under a bumper and works the next ball round the corner to short fine leg. Four balls to go. Amid the mayhem, Stokes was unable to keep the strike, so it\u2019s Cummins to Leach. One to tie, two to win. One wicket to retain the Ashes. 125 overs That should have been out. I am sure that was out. He missed a slog sweep at a ball that straightened sharply and would surely have hit leg stump. We haven\u2019t seen a replay yet. We have now: it would have been out on review! Stokes survives a huge LBW shout - and Australia wasted their review a moment ago! That looked so close. Stokes reverse swept to the fielder, Leach set off and was sent back. The fielder threw to Lyon, who let it through his hands. NATHAN LYON HAS DROPPED THE BALL WITH LEACH MILES OUT OF HIS GROUND! I cannot believe this. 124.4 overs: England 357-9 (target 359; Stokes 131, Leach 0) Stokes cuts, and it\u2019s fielded well at cover point. My goodness. 124.3 overs: England 357-9 (target 359; Stokes 131, Leach 0) Stokes goes down the ground - and it\u2019s six more!!!!! Two to win, one to tie. TAKE THE TIE BEN. 124.2 overs: England 351-9 (target 359; Stokes 125, Leach 0) No run. This is terrific bowling from Lyon. 124.1 overs: England 351-9 (target 359; Stokes 125, Leach 0) Stokes slaps Lyon to the cover sweeper and turns down a single. It\u2019ll be Nathan Lyon to continue. Leach is not out! Yes, it pitched miles outside leg. Australia have no reviews left. 124 overs: England 351-9 (target 359; Stokes 125, Leach 0) Stokes can\u2019t watch - but Leach survives! Australia appealed for LBW but it pitched outside leg. Australia are going to review, just in case, but I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t out. 123.5 overs: England 351-9 (target 359; Stokes 125, Leach 0) Here comes Cummins ... and Leach gets under a bouncer. One more ball. 123.4 overs: England 351-9 (target 359; Stokes 125, Leach 0) A single. Stokes wanted two but couldn\u2019t risk the second. Leach has two balls to survive. 123.3 overs: England 350-9 (target 359; Stokes 124, Leach 0) Four more! Stokes has whacked Cummins straight down the ground off the back foot! Nine to win. 123.2 overs: England 346-9 (target 359; Stokes 120, Leach 0) Stokes pulls Cummins for four! David Warner, trying to take the catch, dived over the ball at deep midwicket. 123.1 overs: England 342-9 (target 359; Stokes 116, Leach 0) Stokes is dropped! It was a sharp chance for Harris, diving forward at third man - just like Simon Jones at Edgbaston all those years ago. Didn\u2019t Australia need 17 to win then as well? Cummins replaces Hazlewood, whose only over went for 19. 123 overs: England 342-9 (target 359; Stokes 116, Leach 0) Leach defends. Well played again. \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019ve gotta admit, this has been one hell of a fight!\u201d says Shivam Baurai. \u201cFirst Root and Denly dig deep, with Stokes\u2019 incredible 2 off 50-something balls. Then, today, a great partnership between Stokes and Bairstow. Bairstow, Buttler and Woakes\u2019 dismissals have been pretty soft, but Stokes has fought admirably. He\u2019s easily been England\u2019s best player this year.\u201d 122.5 overs: England 342-9 (target 359; Stokes 116, Leach 0) A single to Stokes. Seventeen to win, one ball for Leach to survive, again. 122.4 overs: England 341-9 (target 359; Stokes 115, Leach 0) This is crafty stuff from Lyon, who is bowling very wide of off stump. Two more dot balls. 122.2 overs: England 341-9 (target 359; Stokes 115, Leach 0) A huge offspinner turns straight to first slip! 122.1 overs: England 341-9 (target 359; Stokes 115, Leach 0) Stokes survives an appeal for caught behind after missing a reverse sweep! No review from Australia. Nathan Lyon returns to the attack. Sheesh, that\u2019s a fascinating move. Will Stokes try to win it in this over? 122 overs: England 341-9 (target 359; Stokes 115, Leach 0) Hazlewood tries the leg-stump yorker and misses. Stokes is back on strike, 18 to win. Truly, I do not know what is going off out there. 121.5 overs: England 341-9 (target 359; Stokes 115, Leach 0) He takes a single off the penultimate delivery. One ball for Leach to survive. Whatever happens, this performance from Ben Stokes is off the scale. My fingers are trembling. 121.4 overs: England 340-9 (target 359; Stokes 114, Leach 0) Can he steal two? He does! 19 to win. The fifty partnership has come up. Leach has made none of them. 121.3 overs: England 338-9 (target 359; Stokes 112, Leach 0) Six more over midwicket! Sixteen from three balls! England are 21 away! Ben Stokes might be 21 away from a knighthood. 121.2 overs: England 332-9 (target 359; Stokes 106, Leach 0) Now he\u2019s hit him for six! It was a low full toss, an attempted yorker, and Stokes pinged it straight over the rope at square leg! 121.1 overs: England 326-9 (target 359; Stokes 100, Leach 0) Hazlewood replaces Pattinson - and Stokes pulls him for four to reach the most glorious hundred! 121st over: England 322-9 (target 359; Stokes 96, Leach 0) Stokes steals two more to fine leg. He slipped at the non-striker\u2019s end and looked in trouble, but Harris threw to the wrong end. Stokes is absolutely shattered, and he walks a single off the penultimate delivery. One ball for Leach to survive - and he does, prompting another enormous cheer. 120.3 overs: England 319-9 (target 359; Stokes 93, Leach 0) Paine decides he can risk Lyon no longer; Pat Cummins replaces him. Stokes steals two off the first ball - and then he scoops Cummins for six! That\u2019s another outrageous stroke to go with his reverse sweep off Lyon. After all the criticism of England\u2019s batsmen for treating Test cricket like an ODI, it would be especially amusing if Stokes won the match with a series of white-ball strokes. Forty to win. \u201cFollowing surreptitiously from a cafe in the Cotswolds,\u201d says Nick Parish. \u201cWife not amused. However the waitress has just put this on the table. It\u2019s a message from God.\u201d Either that or an indication of which ketchup was on a two-for-one offer when the cafe owners did their weekly shop. 120th over: England 311-9 (target 359; Stokes 85, Leach 0) Stokes tries to smear Pattinson out of the ground, drags the ball onto his knee and shouts in pain. He takes a single off the second ball - he wanted two but it was too tight - which gives Leach four balls to survive. He does well to drop a nasty delivery short of the slips, and diligently blocks the rest of the over. Well played. Ben Stokes needs 48 to win. \u201cBroad has always been a selfish player,\u201d says Olly Blaydon, \u201cbut using that review was appalling.\u201d For once, I\u2019d say he gets a pass \u2013 two wickets left, two reviews remaining, so it was a freebie. Something might have appeared on Ultra-Edge. 119th over: England 310-9 (target 359; Stokes 84, Leach 0) Stokes smears Lyon down the ground for six more! The leaping Hazlewood was close to taking the catch, but Stokes got just enough on it. And then he reverse sweeps Lyon for a mighty six! That\u2019s an outrageous shot, almost identical to the one he played against India in the World Cup. And he steals a single off the last ball to keep the strike. The crowd are going mad! It\u2019s surely a doomed venture from Stokes, but it\u2019s spine-tingling stuff nonetheless. He is a superhero. 118th over: England 297-9 (target 359; Stokes 71, Leach 0) Stokes turns down a single off Pattinson\u2019s first and third deliveries. The fourth is a wide and then, after a change of bat, Stokes knocks a short ball into a gap and comes back for two. An edged single gives Leach one ball to survive - and he does, ducking under a bouncer. Ben Stokes needs 62 to win. 117th over: England 293-9 (target 359; Stokes 68, Leach 0) Stokes will surely go down swinging. He does, swishing Lyon down the ground for six, and then he takes a single off the last ball to keep the strike. For the umpteenth time this summer, he is alone on the burning deck. The futile superheroism of his performance in the second innings, with bat and ball, almost brings a lump to the throat. 116th over: England 286-9 (Stokes 61, Leach 0) Pattinson tries to slip a yorker behind the legs of Leach, who does well to dig it out. A wicket maiden, so Ben Stokes will have six balls from Nathan Lyon to hit the 73 runs England need. He\u2019s gone! It was a brilliant delivery from Pattinson, a sizzling yorker that slipped under the bat and trapped Broad in front. Broad, who was expecting the bouncer, was right back in his crease. Broad is out LBW! Australia are one wicket away from glory! Broad has reviewed it but it looks plumb. 115th over: England 286-8 (Stokes 61, Broad 0) Head took that catch very calmly. He was backpedalling towards the rope, so he threw the ball up before his momentum took him off the field, then stepped back inside the rope to complete a relay catch with himself. Archer has gone! He hacked two boundaries earlier in the over, but they were risky strokes and he ran out of luck off the last delivery. He slog-swept Lyon high towards the deep midwicket boundary, where Head took a beautifully judged catch. 114th over: England 277-7 (Stokes 60, Archer 7) Archer is beaten, flashing at a wider delivery from Pattinson. That aside he defends solidly, as he has for most of this innings, and it\u2019s a maiden. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cDoing my fatherly duty and accompanying 17-year-old daughter to see The 1975 in the baking heat in Glasgow. As you might imagine, the fortunes of the England cricket team are not high on the list of priorities for teenage August bank holiday festivalgoers in Glasgow. But I\u2019m doing my bit by following the OBO. Us Scots know a thing or two about heroic failures...\u201d Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Sunday Sunday here again: after the World Cup final and the dramatic end to the Lord\u2019s Test, we\u2019ve had another day of delicious tension in the old cricket. Australia have been given quite a fright, but that will make their probable victory all the sweeter. The last time they retained the Ashes was on 1 December 2002. They are three wickets away; England need another miracle from Ben Stokes. 113th over: England 277-7 (Stokes 60, Archer 7) Lyon to Stokes, with two slips and a bat-pad on the off side. He pushes a run behind point. After a lot of careful defensive shots, Archer takes Lyon on. Lofts him into the leg side, landing safely for a run of his own. Stokes follows it up by advancing and driving straight for four! Gorgeous shot! All along the ground, proper straight drive, nothing uncontrolled about it, and it beats mid-on inside the line for four! England need 82 to win! Drinks are on the field. And I\u2019m going to get amongst the Western Terrace. Rob Smyth will take you home or take you off the road into a ditch from here. 112th over: England 271-7 (Stokes 55, Archer 6) Tell you what, Archer is doing the job against fast bowling beautifully. Ducks every Pattinson bouncer, gets right behind every Pattinson fuller ball. Edges one on the bounce to slip, but you\u2019ll forgive that. Maiden. 111th over: England 271-7 (Stokes 55, Archer 6) With Archer on strike, Paine brings back Cummins immediately. This will be short all over, with three men out in the deep on the leg side. But Cummins bowls wide of off, and Archer cracks him for four! Cut shot, airy, but no one anywhere near it on the off side. Archer ducks one, plays one down nicely to short leg, then nudges to midwicket and sets off for a single. Stokes sends him back, but that draws an overthrow. One more run, and Stokes blocks the yorker to close. 88 to win. 110th over: England 266-7 (Stokes 55, Archer 1) Steve Smith faced bowlers in the nets today for the first time since his concussion. He\u2019ll play against Derby and be back for the fourth Test. Jimmy Anderson very likely will be as well. Stokes goes hard at Pattinson but straight back to the bowler. Eventually takes a single from the third ball. Archer will have to face Pattinson, but there\u2019s no alarm as the first ball flies way over his head. The next short one is at the body, and Archer flips it nonchalantly off his hip between the fielders in the deep, and gets one. Stokes stabs a single to keep the strike, but a misfield \u2013 accidental or no? \u2013 allows a second run, and after some hesitation the batsmen take it. 93 to win. 109th over: England 262-7 (Stokes 52, Archer 0) Lyon to Archer then. Right-hander, long-armed. He stretches down the pitch a couple of times to block Lyon, then gloves one over the top of short leg! Turn and bounce, evading Labuschagne. Also a slip and a leg slip in place. Archer dead-bats the rest of the over, proving to Stokes that he\u2019ll be good and not try to clear long-on, as he did when he got out against Sri Lanka in the World Cup. 108th over: England 262-7 (Stokes 52, Archer 0) In-out field for Stokes against Hazlewood, who has done a power of work. Three slips still in position, but the field is set fairly deep at cover, mid-off, mid-on, then boundary riders at point, square leg, long leg. He hits the field a couple of times and doesn\u2019t chance a single, thinking of pinching one from the last ball but then scrambling back. 107th over: England 262-7 (Stokes 52, Archer 0) Well, it\u2019s the man of the moment sauntering to the crease, Jofra Archer. Stokes is happy to trust him, cutting a single from Lyon. Archer can bat. First-class average over 30, with six half-centuries. England just need a partnership, someone to stay with Stokes while he puts on 40 or 50. Then assess the run to the finish line. 97 to win. 106th over: England 261-7 (Stokes 51) That\u2019s a shocker, Chris Woakes. After five short balls in a row from Hazlewood, all of which he plays well, he gets one full ball and drives it straight to cover. What are you doing? Stokes is battling like mad, and the last three wickets have just been given away. 105th over: England 261-6 (Stokes 51, Woakes 1) Two slips for Stokes when Lyon bowls. But they aren\u2019t any use when Lyon bowls short, which allows Stokes to cut two runs and raise his minor milestone, as well as getting the deficit under three figures. He gets a genuine standing ovation from the entire ground. He is carrying England once again, after 25 overs with the ball in the third innings, after a century at Lord\u2019s, after the World Cup campaign... England need 98 to win. 104th over: England 259-6 (Stokes 49, Woakes 1) Hazlewood in short, and Woakes rides the bounce to push a single out behind square. They\u2019ll go short at him after Cummins did a number on him last time. He handles that one well. Three slips still in for Stokes, plus a deep backward point. Cover, mid-off, mid-on, deep square leg, long leg. Stokes takes a run to the midwicket gap to keep the strike. England need an even 100. And the Terrace goes wild once again. 103rd over: England 257-6 (Stokes 48, Woakes 0) Chris Woakes to the middle. Stokes takes out some of his frustration on a short ball from Lyon, carving it through cover point for four. England are still 102 runs from the impossible. What on earth! What have they done? Shambles! Never a run! Stokes works Lyon to the leg side, straight to midwicket. Stokes stutters two steps down, and Buttler just goes with the striker instead of paying attention to the field. He realises the ball is in the hands of Marcus Harris and turns back, but the throw hits direct from midwicket as Lyon falls over backwards trying to field it. That is a ludicrous mistake, and England have thrown away their slight chance, first with Bairstow and now with Buttler. As in the World Cup too many times, Stokes will have to do it alone. 102nd over: England 253-5 (Stokes 44, Buttler 1) Hazlewood, short, and Stokes pulls it for four! Top shot. The short ball didn\u2019t quite get up, it was about collarbone high, and Stokes nails the swivel-heeled pull. In front of square to beat the man in the deep behind the line. You think this is the only option for England, they have to keep the deficit coming down to maintain pressure on Australia. Get it down to double figures and see what the squeeze can bring. Stokes nudges a single. Three slips for Butter and that short cover that got him in the first innings. Lyon at backward point. Mid-off, mid-on, midwicket, long leg. Hazle beats the edge, there was a hint of swing on that ball still. England need 106 to win. 101st over: England 248-5 (Stokes 39, Buttler 1) Lyon from the Kirkstall Lane end, and Stokes is looking more comfortable against him now, twice working straighter balls off his pads to leg for singles. Buttler is less so, playing to short leg before getting off the mark with a thick inside edge behind square. England need Nelson, 111. 100th over: England 245-5 (Stokes 37, Buttler 0) It always seemed like the weight of numbers would tell against England. Too many balls to face, too many chances to make a mistake. Bairstow got the scoreboard moving though, he gave England some impetus. Now it\u2019s Stokes and Buttler, the World Cup partnership, as the last real hope for England to do something else remarkable. They added 110 in that final, and they need 114 here. Buttler survives five balls of Hazlewood: leaves three, blocks two. Wicket maiden for Hazlewood, he\u2019s been so good in this match. There\u2019s that breakthrough! Bairstow goes, going after a wide ball, gets a thick edge to second slip and it\u2019s taken! Still 114 behind! 99th over: England 245-4 (Stokes 37, Bairstow 36) Lyon to Stokes, and missed at first slip! Barely a catch, because it was so low, Warner got down just above the ground and fingertipped it into the turf. It goes for four. It was wide to his left hand and dipping, and his weight was going the wrong way. 98th over: England 241-4 (Stokes 33, Bairstow 36) \u201cHe\u2019s got the eyes back, that\u2019s good,\u201d says Alastair Cook on the BBC coverage. Talking about Bairstow\u2019s angry-intense focus look. A fair bit of chat between Bairstow and Paine after the review goes in favour of the more ginger of the keepers. He adds a single from JH, as does Stokes. 118 to win. Here\u2019s Timothy Sanders. \u201cThe fascinating paradox of yesterday &amp; today is that, on a dry and slowish pitch, the old ball is easier to survive against, but harder to score safely off. The new ball has proved to be both a danger and an opportunity. Jonny\u2019s positive approach to batting against the new ball is England\u2019s best chance; and also means Australia are always in with a chance of breaking through. It will come down to who gets a bit of luck, in the blink of an eye when the wrong shot is selected, or an unplayable ball comes down.\u201d Hazlewood beats the inside edge as Bairstow plays an awkward chop. The ball seamed in and maybe kept a bit low. Gaffaney gives it out, Bairstow goes the Mr T immediately, and the replays show no contact! England survive! 97th over: England 239-4 (Stokes 32, Bairstow 35) We\u2019re back. Lyon bowls an over for a single, pulled hard by Bairstow past short leg and between the two boundary riders. One less to get. \u201cWhat a time to be alive,\u201d writes my colleage Martin Farrer. \u201cAm I the only England fan who noted the significance of Australia losing their last eight wickets for 43 on the first day, recalling Willis\u2019s figures in 81?\u201d I\u2019m going to say yes to that one. I\u2019m sure Andrew Samson of TMS noticed, but he\u2019s impartial. \u201cThanks to Wade Howland and OBO,\u201d replies Will. \u201cHave downloaded the app and will watch it but still might have to give priority to a hospital run.\u201d We all have our decisions to make, Will. \u201cCongrats to Will Dickerson earlier,\u201d writes Wade Howland. \u201cIn Australia he should be able to livestream the game on his phone via the 9Now app. I\u2019m convinced England will do this, and fair play to them. Sets the series up beautifully.\u201d Speaking of Amazing Adelaide, there\u2019s no bad time to throw in John Farnham\u2019s 80s ad for Rundle Mall. Very fair email from Sarah Bacon. \u201cIf England pull this off today, it will at least be an overdue addition to the highlights collection rolled out by Sky ad infinitum. Headingly 1981, while memorable, is getting a little too long in the tooth. I\u2019ll bet a lot of OBOers can\u2019t even remember it, so an update would be grand.\u201d That would be nice. Though I understand that Nine have mostly been filling their rain breaks with Amazing Adelaide. A suggestion from a few readers that if you can\u2019t load TMS via the YouTube link that I posted earlier, you can also get it on a UK phone using the TuneIn app. This is probably true. \u201cWaiting for my first born, due date today, a Brit living in Australia but can\u2019t get the cricket on my TV. Don\u2019t think I can get away with going to the pub. What the birdsong are my priorities?!\u201d Will Dickerson, if your child is born during the overnight span of one of history\u2019s great Test results, it will be story to tell them forever. If your child is born some time after a desultory England defeat that looked falsely exciting for an hour or so, maybe just leave that bit out. Adolescence is hard enough as it is. I left off the emails in that session because the cricket was... worth our attention. But let\u2019s have a couple at lunch. \u201cSame pitch, same sunny day, same batsmen, same bowlers... so what\u2019s the deal?\u201d Well, Stephen Morley... cricket, innit? It\u2019s super weird sometimes. It\u2019s a rolling maul of peculiarity. Vastly disparate results branch out from similar stems. There are trillions of possible sequences within a single match, and sometimes those sequences stand out thanks to the parameters that our perspective on the universe deem notable. I have no idea. None. What a Test match this is turning out to be. Overnight, an England win looked a distant dream. When Root fell early, the dream was over. But the next wicket did not follow it, with Stokes and Bairstow batting through. Of course, Australia are still in the box seat. All it takes is one mistake, one wicket, and suddenly England will look miles from safety again. Jos Buttler fresh out of runs in this series, a sore Chris Woakes and the tail to come. That is still the overwhelming likelihood. But there was a chance overnight that England could defy it, and there remains a chance at lunch on the fourth day. Australia will regroup and come back hard at England, and Bairstow especially will play shots and give any bowler a chance. But if the momentum of this partnership can get through another 50 runs or so, who knows. 96th over: England 238-4 (Stokes 32, Bairstow 34) Last over before lunch, and Marnus will be the one to bowl it. From short leg to leg-break. His over isn\u2019t too testing though, with the batsmen working a few singles, not worried about being overly defensive before the break. That\u2019s what they need to do: stay relaxed, stay confident, and make good decisions. That\u2019s lunch, and what a session for England! 95th over: England 235-4 (Stokes 31, Bairstow 32) Lyon to Stokes, that squeaky match-up once again. Stokes has to play at every ball, but he does it well. Gets well forward, controls his strokes. Even the one that Labuschagne fields at short leg, it comes to him on the bounce, down sharply into the ground first. Another maiden. 94th over: England 235-4 (Stokes 31, Bairstow 32) Bairstow is playing this smart, seeing out Cummins with lunch in a moment and only so many overs that Australia\u2019s enforcer can bowl. Another maiden as Bairstow ducks, blocks and leaves as required. 93rd over: England 235-4 (Stokes 31, Bairstow 32) Lyon to Stokes again. You wonder whether Bairstow should be trying to take more of the strike from the off-spinner, especially with 13 minutes to lunch. Lyon\u2019s second ball turns past the push once again, Stokes prodding. Eventually he gets off strike by patting one on the head down to fine leg. That looks a better arrangement for England. Better still when Bairstow drops to one knee and sweeps four! Into the Western Terrace fence to delirious applause. Down between the legs of Labuschagne, then back-spinning enough to get behind square and split the two men in the deep. Then an inside edge! Into the pad and over short leg! Well, the umpire gives it a run, but on replay I think that was just off the thigh pad. 124 runs to win, the partnership is 76. 92nd over: England 229-4 (Stokes 30, Bairstow 27) Cummins finally wrests back a measure of control, bowling a maiden. A couple of those balls are a bit wide or a bit short to cause Bairstow any dilemmas, but a couple that angle in or hang in the channel require more care. 91st over: England 229-4 (Stokes 30, Bairstow 27) Nathan Lyon is back for Australia. He only bowled two overs earlier, picked up Joe Root and was off for the new ball. He got fourth-innings wickets for Australia in Birmingham, he needs to get them at least one here. And he nearly does, after Bairstow turns over the strike. Lyon bowls well to left-handers, Stokes is one, and twice Lyon turns the ball sharply past the edge of Stokes\u2019 bat. Except Lyon to settle in for a long spell here. Will Stokes try to go after him as he did at Lord\u2019s? Lyon drew a lot of false shots there too. Vital battle, it looks like. Stay tuned. England need 130 to stay in the Ashes. 90th over: England 228-4 (Stokes 30, Bairstow 26) Cummins in to Stokes, and he\u2019s been pulled for six! That was the flip-pull that Stokes got wrong earlier, again to a ball that isn\u2019t all that short. This time Stokes makes better contact, looping it high over backward square leg and over the rope. That makes a difference! He pushes another single to point, before Paine fumbles a bye from the final ball of the over. 62 runs added since the new ball. Romeo emails in: \u201cA quarter of today\u2019s target for England in 80 minutes, for one seventh of Australia\u2019s. Australia\u2019s bowlers haven\u2019t (or didn\u2019t) serve up any bad balls for the batsmen to punish, so they blocked and left, and did so very well. In the last three overs or so, it seems to be slightly squirting England\u2019s way. All that said, another two great deliveries and it all changes.\u201d 89th over: England 220-4 (Stokes 23, Bairstow 26) Pattinson is hitting 90 miles an hour consistently now. Most of the time it looks good, right on the off stump of Stokes and shaping. Then it looks bad, when he slips too wide and Stokes plays his best shot of the innings, a dominant cut shot for four! Through cover point, up high, right on top of it, and hit with a sashaying bat for extra style points. What a shot, and the crowd noise booms again. This is some atmosphere. 88th over: England 215-4 (Stokes 18, Bairstow 26) Time to calm down a bit. The England pair are both very watchful against Hazlewood, who does look the biggest threat. His accuracy, his bit of seam movement. A Stokes single gets Bairstow on strike, who edges streakily away for a couple more runs. 87th over: England 212-4 (Stokes 17, Bairstow 24) Pattinson, to Bairstow, and he drives hard at a wide ball, so wide he has one hand off the bat as he slices through point. Two runs. Pattinson hoops a couple, then loses his line down the leg side! Four leg byes. The runs keep coming. What\u2019s this though? What\u2019s this? Pattinson has lost it wildly! He bowls a Harmison ball. Not quite that bad, because it swung a mile. But it starts wide and goes wider, literally to first slip, and it dips on Warner who is leaping across but can\u2019t get down far enough, and it sneaks under his fingertips for extras! It\u2019s called wide, so five wides added to the total. What on earth. Pattinson finishes the over on the pads, and Bairstow clips two more runs. That\u2019s 13 off the over, most of them extras, and this pair have added ... I think it\u2019s 53 from 57 balls. The Western Terrace is losing it. What a change in mood, and what a passage of play. We\u2019re under 150, it\u2019s 147 to win. 86th over: England 199-4 (Stokes 17, Bairstow 20) Hazlewood pitching up, and being driven again. This time bang straight by Bairstow for four! Stokes follows up with a similar shot for two, the bat twisting a bit in his hands to dampen some of the power. The deficit is down to 160. If this pair do a bit of what they did at Lord\u2019s, things could get interesting. Woakes apparently doesn\u2019t bowl in this team anymore but his batting could then get useful. Hmmm. 85th over: England 192-4 (Stokes 15, Bairstow 15) Cummins continues to Stokes, and gets clobbered! That was streaky as Canadian bacon, but equally delicious to the packed Western Terrace as it flew their way. Cummins loses his line and bowls way outside off, and Stokes throws the bat. Much like the shot that got him out in the first innings, except the ball was shorter. This time instead of the top edge flying to slip, it soars over the slips to third man for four. Cummins goes around the wicket to angle in, so Stokes picks him off for two through midwicket. Apparently we\u2019re having a shocking morning on the typo front, so please refresh your page if something doesn\u2019t look right. Maybe we will have found it already. England need 167. 84th over: England 186-4 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 15) That\u2019s better from Bairstow! Out of the middle that time, as Hazlewood pitches up and gets cover-driven for his trouble. Four runs, but he won\u2019t mind too much if the drive is being played. And you can see why the very next ball: Hazlewood pitches up again, Bairstow drives straighter this time, or aims straighter, but nicks it through gully for a far more risky boundary. There\u2019s another great bit of running to follow, again turning one leg bye into two after he\u2019s hit on the pads. Sharp. England have passed the halfway mark, they need 173 to win, and that\u2019s drinks. 83rd over: England 176-4 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 7) One of these batsmen doesn\u2019t look long for this innings. Bairstow has a couple of goes outside off stump and misses, then manages to fend away another short ball from Cummins for a run. Stokes goes from no-shot to millionaire, trying a pull to waist-high bounce and edging it high in the air, over midwicket to eventually land safely on the practice strips out on the eastern side of the ground. Two runs. Pretty much, hey? They\u2019ve never won a World Cup, so that would set this apart from crazy Ashes performances of the past. 82nd over: Engand 173-4 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 6) Hazlewood now, and he starts by barbecuing Bairstow\u2019s outside edge, then goes for the pads. With Bairstow\u2019s high backlift it\u2019s a big ask for him to get down in time to keep those balls out. One bounces away for a couple of leg byes, with the appeal turned down, and another he squeezes out via an edge to the fine leg boundary, where Cummins puts in a brilliant save. Some equally good running on both of those misadventures takes England on by five runs. They just need the 186 to win. 81st over: England 167-4 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 3) Right then, now the real stuff starts. And with Root already gone. There\u2019s some weight behind Cummins\u2019 deliveries already, shaking Bairstow\u2019s bat as it gets hit hard from back of a length. YJB gets a run as he fends a ball without control into the leg side. There are catchers in the cordon but not in front of the wicket. Stokes looks a bit more controlled off the back half of the over, defending. 80th over: England 166-4 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 2) Last over before the new ball. Bairstow ticks Lyon off his pads, before Stokes shuffles to whip gloriously through midwicket for four. Billiard-smooth across the carpet. First boundary for England since the 61st over. Here\u2019s a useful tip. \u201cAs a long time OBOer I am aware that all threads remain open at all times, although England\u2019s ability to collapse means they are often cut off. When today inevitably ends the series early I can strongly recommend you head to the rooftop bar of the Belgrave bar to enjoy the sunshine. You\u2019ll be in a line down the street to get into the Original Oak beer garden and the Belgrave provides great views and beer. You\u2019re cool enough to look them up on instagram I\u2019m sure. As a Yorkshireman living in Belfast the only positive to ending the series early is I\u2019ll no longer be getting strange looks from my colleagues for manically refreshing a Guardian webpage then looking disappointed. All the best, and enjoy several superb pints of Berliner for me.\u201d Was... that email written by a beer garden? Apparently it was written by Thomas Brennan. 79th over: Engand 160-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) Pattinson pushes up towards the new ball, which presumably now Cummins and Hazlewood will take. A maiden, with a leg bye from Bairstow\u2019s thigh pad, while Stokes leaves the rest. 78th over: England 160-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) Sorry to be that bearer of bad news for our English readers, but Root 66 has become Root 77. The Australians reading can stop worrying unnecessarily. That said, Stokes gets his first run of the day from Lyon\u2019s over, increasing his tally by 50%, while Bairstow gets off the mark with a single. So, not all bad? There it goes! The key wicket, the one that both sides\u2019 hopes hinged upon, and it\u2019s come about 76 runs too early for England. The early pace burst hasn\u2019t worked but the change to spin has. Unable to score against pace, Root wants to take his chance against spin. He comes down the wicket, trying to drive. Lyon turns it. Inside edge, must have clipped the pad because it loops up over the wicketkeeper. It should be safe, but from the side of stage David Warner comes flying into shot, hands outstretched, and takes a wonderful catch before he hits the ground. What a way for it to happen. England on the brink, and Lyon goes to 356 Test wickets, passing Dennis Lillee to take his own place on Australia\u2019s list behind McGrath and Warne. 77th over: England 157-3 (Root 76, Stokes 2) There\u2019s a run! 26 balls into the morning, Root stands up tall and steers Pattinson into the gully for a quick single. Last ball of the over, Pattinson minces Stokes! Gorgeous delivery. Angled slightly across at the left-hander\u2019s off stump, then leaving him off the pitch at 89 miles per hour. Past the edge by a whisker. Take a moment. \u201cHow on earth does WinViz say 29% England?\u201d implores Simon Yates. \u201cAnyone needing to keep their hope down to realistic levels should remind themselves of the all-time highest chases list. If that doesn\u2019t work, add up the averages of the remaining batsmen. Get a bit less than the target, even with Leach\u2019s artificially inflated for now. Consider whether the conditions today (pitch, quality of attack, level of pressure, imminent new ball) are likely to be more or less favourable than in each batsman\u2019s typical innings. Adjust WinViz percentage down, a lot... It\u2019s the hope that kills you. Save yourselves.\u201d It\u2019s the hope that gets England at Headingley... the last big chase here it was Shai Hope, making the second of his twin hundreds for the West Indies. 76th over: Engand 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) Hazlewood to Stokes, and he\u2019s hit! That\u2019s hit Stokes in the grille. Nasty bouncer, Hazlewood has a really uncomfortable one. He\u2019s very accurate with it. Last ball of the over, in which Stokes has been looking to get forward assiduously, including a flick off the pads that bounced just in front of Head at midwicket. So the bowler gives him a short one to close, and there\u2019s an exclamation from the crowd as the batsman\u2019s neck guard goes flying off the helmet in two pieces. They\u2019re designed to detach on impact, but he wasn\u2019t hit on the neck guard itself. Stokes gets the once over and decides to carry on. It seems from Labuschagne\u2019s example that the grille is the best place to be hit, if be hit you must. It seems to distribute impact away from the head better than the helmet itself. Four overs without a run this morning. 75th over: England 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) Pattinson to Root, another maiden. Anyone who thought there might be some thought of scoring before bunkering down against the new ball, you were incorrect. There will be bunkering both before and afterwards. So many lost souls needing their TMS link as they drift through the outside-UK world. Patience, my pretties. I should also note that it\u2019s the ABC Grandstand link, as our guiding light Jim Maxwell is a key part of the coverage. 74th over: England 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) Hazlewood to resume from the Football Stand end. I like this, he\u2019s the one who knocked off a couple of quick wickets in Adelaide in 2017 on the fifth morning to torpedo some similar overnight English optimism. Good captaincy, he can warm up into a spell and then have a couple of overs with the new ball. Double threat. Stokes blocks and leaves his way through a maiden, and now has 2 from 56 balls. 73rd over: England 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) WinViz has been out all night and needs to get some sleep. Good morning from Headingley, the field of dreams. The 404 chase was here, where Arthur Morris made 173 alongside Braddles. The whatever it was chase was here, where Mark Butcher made 173. Is Joe Root going to make 173 today? Probably not. The harsh realist in me expects everyone to be deflated when a wicket falls within the first few overs. James Pattinson takes the old ball for a decent start at decent pace. A couple of yorkers that look hard to smother. A ball just down leg that clips the hip of Root and wasn\u2019t far from the edge. A maiden though, survived. Seven overs till the new Duke. Ok, the battered old copy of Jerusalem is being inserted into the Headingley cassette player, which means it\u2019s time for me to take my leave and chew my fingernails to the quick. Have fun with Geoff Lemon. Send him your emails (geoff.lemon@theguardian.com) and tweets (@geofflemonsport). Toby Ebbs asked for help and Paul Griffin has stepped up. \u201cToby Ebbs should propose,\u201d he emails. \u201cShe\u2019ll be walking on air and tolerant of his cricket watching. He can simply rescind the proposal once The Ashes is over. Happy to help (I\u2019m foreseeing a new career as an agony uncle of Stalinesque wisdom and tenderness).\u201d What a fabulous image. Tom vd Gucht is a glass half-full guy - but I get where he\u2019s coming from. \u201cI almost don\u2019t want them to win as it will paper over the cracks that have been laid bare within the England batting line up. For the past couple of years, the team seems to often bounce back and put in a display that just about redeems them after a series of terrible performances. Everyone pats each other on the back and they retain the same squad for the next tour only to suffer some trouncing before doing just enough again to avoid serious changes being made. Even Joe Denly, as resolute as he was yesterday, is still likely to have earned another series based on a 50 despite the fact he seems to flirt outside offstump as often as Vince. If we lose the Ashes, it may be the catalyst for a serious test overhaul with the new coach doing a Fletcher 99 and bringing in some fresh top order batsmen to mould whilst allowing the ODI batsmen to flourish at what they do best.\u201d In amongst all the speculation there\u2019s science. WinViz reckons the match situation is 70/30 in favour of Australia. Brian Withington might be on to something. \u201cI may not appear to be the first to suggest that it\u2019s all about the new ball. But I\u2019m talking about the third one due this evening. At current run rates England may be looking at a desperate Aus final fling late this evening and then again (if that\u2019s not contradictory) tomorrow morning. Drama. You heard it here first.\u201d \u201cAn excellent initiative for second and subsequent new balls. Some Test-playing nations have even experimented with this for the first new ball, putting in two watchmen at the start of the innings. I believe they\u2019re typically referred to as openers. Bayliss and co might like to try this new-fangled stunt once in a while.\u201d Adrian Armstrong there with a well-crafted email. Joe Root stole the headlines yesterday but Joe Denly performed admirably as his offsider. Steve Smith continues to push for a return to the Australian XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford. \u201cMorning Jonathan,\u201d morning Damian Clarke. \u201cLes Mis or Les Fat? I\u2019m feeling a bit more Les Big Byrd, \u201cA Little More Numb\u201d. Ian Chappell: \u201cJason Roy is totally out of his depth opening in Test cricket.\u201d While England search for an against-the-odds hero, Australia can celebrate their own unlikely saviour, Marnus Labuschagne. When he played a first couple of tentative Tests in late 2018, it came off the back of a few years of Sheffield Shield cricket averaging in the low 30s, and a dearth of domestic batting that meant any player stringing together a couple of scores was in with some chance for higher honours. The new ball watchman idea is catching on. Here\u2019s Geoff Wignall: \u201cEngland will be hoping that Root and Stokes can stick around long enough to deal with the new ball, say another 20 overs. But failing that is there a case for adopting the nightwatchman convention and sending in a newballwatchman (Woakes) to protect Bairstow and after he gets out Buttler, in hope of later runs?\u201d Although Ben Heywood has spotted an obvious flaw. \u201cThe problem is, for it to come into effect either Root or Stokes has to get out first, and I\u2019d rather that didn\u2019t happen until about this time tomorrow.\u201d Toby Ebbs needs help. \u201cI\u2019m currently up in the Sierra de Guadarrama, one hour north of Madrid, where the temperature is a much cooler 28 degrees. I\u2019m on a diplomatic rescue mission to reunite with my girlfriend after a \u2018time out\u2019 of several months. So that I don\u2019t appear inattentive to her needs I have to avoid the score, bank the OBO feed and then scroll through your reports with a mixture of apprehension and excitement at the end of the day. The only thing is that Friday\u2019s play nearly destroyed me and ruined the mission. I was visibly upset but couldn\u2019t really explain why. What should I do today?\u201d My advice: pour a glass of lemonade and confess that you\u2019re a secret cricket watcher. Weather: We\u2019re in for a glorious summer\u2019s day in Leeds, clear and hot. Is this genius, or have I eaten too many Haribo gummy bears? I keep rereading and it continues to make sense. Joe Root has become the central protagonist in this unfolding drama. As Andy Bull writes, what happens today - good or bad - could well define his captaincy of England. Root has played a lot of international cricket in the last six years: 320 innings altogether \u2013 more than any other player \u2013 and he has faced almost 20,000 balls, nearly a quarter as many again as two of the four other great batsmen of this generation, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. Virat Kohli is the only one who gets close. Right now, Root is the only one of the four whose Test average has fallen below the fifty watershed. It falls all the way from 53 to 42 when he has been captain. Root\u2019s game has frayed and worn, Watching his strange field placings in this series, it was beginning to feel as if his leadership was not worth what it costs in runs lost. I like Scott\u2019s approach; methodical, like how a batting coach would break down the challenge. Pitch: The Headingley surface has offered something to the seamers throughout this Test but it\u2019s also improved for batting the longer the match has worn on. There are no gremlins for England to fear, although there are growing footmarks Nathan Lyon could exploit when bowling to left-handers. Tor Turner has emailed in, and I\u2019ll paraphrase, because it sums up what the majority of England supporters seem to communicating. We really really really want and hope England to win. But, it\u2019s horribly possible to see them collapse in under an hour. There can\u2019t be many sporting sides around the world where the gap between two credible outcomes is so vast. Nor where that dichotomy is so keenly embraced by the team\u2019s supporters. So, how did it come to this? Let\u2019s turn to Vic Marks for some guidance. When England were 15 for two in their seventh over with another 344 runs required for victory and 70 overs to be bowled in the day, swift exit possibilities were being explored. Now other possibilities, more unlikely but much more intriguing, have surfaced. In their pursuit of 359 for victory England were 156 for three at the close with Joe Root on home turf attempting to play the innings of his life. At stumps he was unbeaten on 75, which already constitutes his innings of the series. \u201cSince we\u2019re talking about unlikely events, there have been two ties in test cricket history and only four higher fourth innings run chases.\u201d A tie! An excellent idea Ian Forth. That results in a super over, right? Michael Robinson touches on the how, not how may. An interesting approach considering so much of England\u2019s difficulty this summer has been attributed to the focus on white ball run-scoring. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t back England today I can\u2019t help but think that if Root/Stokes, and then Buttler and Bairstow can just keep blocking the ball for two days then the runs will come. Lord knows they got long enough to soak up maidens.\u201d James Roe has joined the growing legion of believers. \u201cEngland just need to dig in and survive the first 20 overs then the Aussies will start to tire and we could be on for a famous England win. The spirit of our world cup victory and never say die and England can do it!\u201d I can\u2019t decide whether this groundswell of confidence makes me think of Les Mis or Les Fat. \u201cIt can\u2019t happen but I can\u2019t stop thinking it might\u201d emails Ben Heywood. \u201c203 runs. 7 wickets left (4 useful). Two days still to play. I know I shouldn\u2019t daydream about a record-breaking, unprecedented comeback, and that we\u2019ll probably be all out by lunchtime....but...but...but...isn\u2019t the mere possibility of the impossible why we watch sport in the first place?\u201d Yes, Ben, yes it is. And reading these emails and watching these dreams shatter into a thousand tiny pieces is why Australians watch the Ashes. Bruce Henderson is steaming in from the Kirkstall Lane end, convinced England are going to do it (with a little help from Steve Marriott), declaring: \u201cFor England, this is the summer of all. Not nothing.\u201d Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day four of the third Ashes Test from Headingley. How are your nerves? If you\u2019re Australian, are you toey? If you\u2019re English, dare you dream? In around an hour from now Joe Root (75*) and Ben Stokes (2*) will stride out to the middle of a field in Leeds in pursuit of the 203 runs England require to pull off one of the most incredible victories in the long history of Test cricket. They have seven wickets with which to complete the heist after suffering the ignominy of a first-innings total of 67. For the improbable to occur all manner of records require breaking. But this is Headingley, the crucible of so many previously unthinkable accomplishments. Commonsense analysis would say Australia are only eight overs from a new ball and their high-quality attack contains four world class, and crucially, patient bowlers. They will have access to a day four pitch that will aid the pacemen with the pristine Dukes and then Nathan Lyon once the ball has aged. No matter how plausible the maths become teams simply don\u2019t chase over 300 in the fourth innings very often. But it is days like today that keep us returning to Test cricket. A day pregnant with possibility. A day that could end with Australians gambolling across the Headingley outfield celebrating the retention of the Ashes or an Englishman or two leaping in delirium with bats raised saluting an unlikely triumph. One way or the other history will be made. If you don\u2019t know the drill yet, I am around for an hour or so to set the scene but as play begins Geoff Lemon will join the fray. If you want to share your thoughts before the opening ball you can reach me on email or you can tweet @JPHowcroft.",

They argue that Boris Johnson\u2019s administration is taking no deal seriously, unlike Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>Even if ministers are right that their preparedness for the physical consequences of no deal are perfect, how sure are they that their colleagues are mentally ready? A number of senior Brexiteers are worried that if Britain does leave without a deal, the main problem might not be that there are what many of them optimistically term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/105976/michael-gove-says-no-deal-brexit-will-cause-bumps-road\" title=\"\">bumps in the road</a>\u201d, but that MPs end up having a massive and very noisy panic attack about the whole endeavour.</p> <p>MPs have a tendency to panic even in small crises, calling anxiously for anyone even tangentially involved to resign so that they can at least appear to have a handle on the situation. They are much like the relatives regularly observed by doctors on geriatric wards: the ones who are the most demanding of the healthcare professionals invariably turn out to be those who failed to visit their ailing mother for years, and are now taking out their guilt on the poor nursing staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/no-deal-brexit-warnings\">The warnings about a no-deal Brexit aren\u2019t being heard. This is what we need to do | Ian Warren</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When flooding hit the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/16/somerset-levels-floods-recedes-moorland-fordgate\" title=\"\">Somerset Levels in the winter of 2013-14</a>, politicians who had paid scant attention to the activities of the Environment Agency suddenly started running around like disturbed ants. One even threatened to take Chris Smith, the boss of the quango, and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/09/floods-environment-agency-chris-smith-hits-back\" title=\"\">stick his head down the loo</a>\u201d. They\u2019re no less brutal with their own parliamentary colleagues: ministerial resignations during bumpy periods are often seen as a way of releasing pressure, rather than actually holding someone accountable for making a mistake.</p> <p>It will be easy for this pattern to manifest itself again in a \u201cbumpy\u201d no-deal scenario. One Brexiteer fretted to me recently that \u201cif there is no deal, journalists like you are going to find various things that have gone wrong, or a few bins that have fallen over, and then my colleagues are all going to start panicking about what no deal has done to the country, even if these problems were entirely unrelated to Brexit. They\u2019ll start saying, \u2018Oh no, this isn\u2019t what I meant at all,\u2019 and will then look around for someone to blame.\u201d Another senior Tory predicts that \u201cwe might have another dodgy dossier-style situation, where you get MPs saying, \u2018I only supported the evidence I was presented with, but now I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Johnson may find this panic hard to weather. Most Conservatives predict that he will win a vote of no confidence if the Labour party calls it in the first week of parliament sitting. But many of them worry that this result will mean the government limps on to a no-deal Brexit without having an election to clear the air. This is one of the reasons why senior Conservatives are making plans for a mid-October poll, which they hope would give Johnson the mandate to demand a new deal from Brussels.</p> <p>There is also the rather obvious blame game going on between the British government and its European counterparts. If there is no deal, Johnson will want to say it was recalcitrant EU leaders who forced Britain out in this way. Similarly European negotiators want to impress upon anyone who will listen that Britain is already dead set on leaving without a deal, and is only throwing up silly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/johnson-varadkar-clash-over-irish-backstop-phone-call-brexit\" title=\"\">suggestions on the backstop</a> that it knows could never work.</p> <p>If the EU fails as a convenient scapegoat, No 10 can also blame the May government for failing to prepare properly, and remainers in parliament for undermining the negotiations. This will drive an even deeper wedge through the Conservative party.</p> <p>Most ministerial attention is currently focused on what the first two weeks of September will bring, rather than on how MPs might behave in November. There are some plans to try to stop parliamentarians panicking. Michael Gove is likely to do weekly statements to the House of Commons on no-deal preparations, so MPs can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t informed, and the prime minister is holding regular dinners with MPs. Johnson on Sunday tried to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/49465298\" title=\"\">prepare his colleagues and the public</a>, saying: \u201cI do not want at this stage to say there won\u2019t be unforeseen difficulties.\u201d His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been pushing ministerial aides to look for possible problems in their own departments in order to avoid a \u201cblack swan event\u201d \u2013 an unexpected and severe crisis.</p> <p>The problem with genuine black swans, though, is that they only ever appear obvious once they have surfaced. Anything special advisers find now isn\u2019t what will cause them the most trouble in the future. All they can do is hope that the most unexpected thing of all happens, which is that MPs don\u2019t conform to their usual pattern, and manage not to panic.</p> <p>\u2022 Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator</p>",

      "bodyText": "Are you ready for a no-deal Brexit? Have you stockpiled enough toilet paper? Built a small fort of tinned tomatoes, just in case? Over the next few weeks, government adverts will start warning the British public, businesses and neighbouring countries to prepare for Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, even though the official position of the government is that it still wants an agreement with Brussels. Ministers insist that they are now preparing properly for this sort of departure on 31 October, and that leaked documents predicting chaos are out of date, wrong, and being released by political opponents who want to scaremonger. They point to the extra \u00a32.1bn being spent on protecting the supply of medicines, on ports and important freight routes, and on preparing local authorities. They argue that Boris Johnson\u2019s administration is taking no deal seriously, unlike Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond. Even if ministers are right that their preparedness for the physical consequences of no deal are perfect, how sure are they that their colleagues are mentally ready? A number of senior Brexiteers are worried that if Britain does leave without a deal, the main problem might not be that there are what many of them optimistically term \u201cbumps in the road\u201d, but that MPs end up having a massive and very noisy panic attack about the whole endeavour. MPs have a tendency to panic even in small crises, calling anxiously for anyone even tangentially involved to resign so that they can at least appear to have a handle on the situation. They are much like the relatives regularly observed by doctors on geriatric wards: the ones who are the most demanding of the healthcare professionals invariably turn out to be those who failed to visit their ailing mother for years, and are now taking out their guilt on the poor nursing staff. When flooding hit the Somerset Levels in the winter of 2013-14, politicians who had paid scant attention to the activities of the Environment Agency suddenly started running around like disturbed ants. One even threatened to take Chris Smith, the boss of the quango, and \u201cstick his head down the loo\u201d. They\u2019re no less brutal with their own parliamentary colleagues: ministerial resignations during bumpy periods are often seen as a way of releasing pressure, rather than actually holding someone accountable for making a mistake. It will be easy for this pattern to manifest itself again in a \u201cbumpy\u201d no-deal scenario. One Brexiteer fretted to me recently that \u201cif there is no deal, journalists like you are going to find various things that have gone wrong, or a few bins that have fallen over, and then my colleagues are all going to start panicking about what no deal has done to the country, even if these problems were entirely unrelated to Brexit. They\u2019ll start saying, \u2018Oh no, this isn\u2019t what I meant at all,\u2019 and will then look around for someone to blame.\u201d Another senior Tory predicts that \u201cwe might have another dodgy dossier-style situation, where you get MPs saying, \u2018I only supported the evidence I was presented with, but now I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u2019\u201d Johnson may find this panic hard to weather. Most Conservatives predict that he will win a vote of no confidence if the Labour party calls it in the first week of parliament sitting. But many of them worry that this result will mean the government limps on to a no-deal Brexit without having an election to clear the air. This is one of the reasons why senior Conservatives are making plans for a mid-October poll, which they hope would give Johnson the mandate to demand a new deal from Brussels. There is also the rather obvious blame game going on between the British government and its European counterparts. If there is no deal, Johnson will want to say it was recalcitrant EU leaders who forced Britain out in this way. Similarly European negotiators want to impress upon anyone who will listen that Britain is already dead set on leaving without a deal, and is only throwing up silly suggestions on the backstop that it knows could never work. If the EU fails as a convenient scapegoat, No 10 can also blame the May government for failing to prepare properly, and remainers in parliament for undermining the negotiations. This will drive an even deeper wedge through the Conservative party. Most ministerial attention is currently focused on what the first two weeks of September will bring, rather than on how MPs might behave in November. There are some plans to try to stop parliamentarians panicking. Michael Gove is likely to do weekly statements to the House of Commons on no-deal preparations, so MPs can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t informed, and the prime minister is holding regular dinners with MPs. Johnson on Sunday tried to prepare his colleagues and the public, saying: \u201cI do not want at this stage to say there won\u2019t be unforeseen difficulties.\u201d His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been pushing ministerial aides to look for possible problems in their own departments in order to avoid a \u201cblack swan event\u201d \u2013 an unexpected and severe crisis. The problem with genuine black swans, though, is that they only ever appear obvious once they have surfaced. Anything special advisers find now isn\u2019t what will cause them the most trouble in the future. All they can do is hope that the most unexpected thing of all happens, which is that MPs don\u2019t conform to their usual pattern, and manage not to panic. \u2022 Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator",

Eddie Howe and his team took plenty of flak \u2013 no shots, no corners and 17.9% possession fuelled plenty of conversation \u2013 but the reality is Bournemouth almost eked out a precious and unprecedented point against the champions. Still, their timeline against City reads eight matches and eight defeats, and Guardiola\u2019s side lead by an aggregate score of 25-3. \u201cWe have to use that record to inspire us in the game,\u201d Howe said. \u201cWe try and embrace these challenges and not fearfully. We lost 3-1 away and the game here was very tight but we felt we were competitive without showing our best attributes. I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re getting closer but results will dictate that.\u201d<br><br>City\u2019s VAR-induced draw against Tottenham last time out ended a run of 15 successive top-flight victories dating back to January and it is difficult to envisage them failing to heed victory on the south coast. David Silva is set to make his 400th appearance in a City shirt, while John Stones is missing for the visitors. \u201cHe is one of the most incredible intelligent players in the small spaces,\u201d Guardiola said of Silva. \u201cHe is one of the best I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s not just the quality, he\u2019s a huge competitor in the training matches. As for Bournemouth, who come into the game on the back of victory at Aston Villa, Howe has a raft of long-term absentees, namely David Brooks, who joined City as a seven-year-old boy, but Joshua King and Callum Wilson are capable of causing havoc. <br><br><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 2pm (BST)<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Read Dominic Fifield\u2019s match report from Bournemouth: Sergio Ag\u00fcero speaks. It is not groundbreaking but nevertheless. \u201cI\u2019m happy because on this pitch it is so hard, so we are happy for the three points,\u201d he says. \u201cThat [second] goal was very important because then we are more relaxed. Always when David receives the ball, I follow him because sometimes the pitch is no good and I know maybe the ball is moving in the grass and then I score.\u201d A gentle reminder that Ag\u00fcero\u2019s double takes his tally for Manchester City to 235, and a grand total of 400 goals for club and country. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty stunning how well Ag\u00fcero has worked with a series of different managers. Most of the players you would think of as \u2018best ever\u2019 really only played with one or two managers, certainly the forwards,\u201d argues Joe Harvey, via email. \u201cAg\u00fcero hasn\u2019t perfectly adapted to what Pep wants, but Ag\u00fcero has to be the first player on a very short list whom Pep has had to compromise his ideals to play, no?\u201d The usual suspects, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Raheem Sterling, come up with the goods on the south coast, while David Silva was absolutely majestic, utterly irresistible on his 400th appearance in a Manchester City shirt. Bournemouth never gave up but Harry Wilson\u2019s delicious free-kick will be just a foot-note. 90+3 min: \u201cSergio Ag\u00fcero is the definition of fox in the box: hungry, eager and lethal from the 18-yard box,\u201d emails Alex from Dunbartonshire. \u201cThe best the Premier League has seen?\u201d He certainly has to be up there. A divine striker. 90 min: There will be four added minutes, and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo is on for the closing stages. The Portuguese defender replaces Kyle Walker, who made an erratic start but has been reasonably solid at full-back. Job done for Pep Guardiola and co. 89 min: Mahrez dances his way to the edge of the Bournemouth area but he is crowded out before Rodri takes over. The hosts clear their lines and, as they break, Otamendi clatters Joshua King, who has been brilliant in circumstances. The Manchester City defender earns a booking for his efforts. 87 min: King combines with Solanke, with the latter testing Ederson from the angle. It is low and hard but straight down the goalkeeper\u2019s throat. No problem for the Brazil stopper. Meanwhile, Guardiola is preparing to throw on Jo\u00e3o Cancelo. The Portuguese could be given his Manchester City debut. 85 min: Manchester City are stroking the ball about for fun. Rodri has done the basics beautifully since coming on to keep the midfield ticking over. City are cruising to victory. 80 min: We need to talk about Sergio Ag\u00fcero. According to Opta, the striker has now scored 400 goals for club and country combined, with 235 of those coming for Manchester City. The man is utterly relentless. Meanwhile, down besides the tunnel Charlie Daniels is on crutches. The injury the 32-year-old defender sustained in the first half is reportedly a repeat of the kneecap injury that meant he missed the tail end of last season. Wishing Daniels a full and swift recovery. 79 min: Bernardo Silva is withdrawn. Mahrez on. 76 min: Guardiola is readying Riyad Mahrez, who scored the winner in this fixture last season, when Bournemouth had no shots, no corners and 17.9% possession. 75 min: Joshua King does brilliantly to buy a throw-in out of Laporte, one of three City defenders in close company. The Bournemouth forward has no intention of giving up the ghost, charging in by the corner flag to steal possession and then ensure they gain an advantage out of the situation. The hosts fail to do much with it, though, as City stream forward through Sterling down the other end. Normal service is resumed. 72 min: Billing gingerly trudges off holding his face. Something is not right \u2013 but the Bournemouth midfielder will soldier on. Down on the touchline, Eddie Howe is desperately trying to gee up his players. The last thing he wants is for this to turn into a rout; City soared to 5-0 win at West Ham on the opening day. 70 min: Philip Billing is down after taking a whack from Bernardo Silva. The Bournemouth midfielder requires a dab of treatment. It all seemed pretty innocuous. A reminder Bournemouth have already used all three substitutes, with Harry Wilson replacing Charlie Daniels towards the end of the first half, and Jordon Ibe and Dom Solanke joining the party a few seconds ago. 68 min: Ibe replaces Adam Smith, Solanke for Callum Wilson. 66 min: Now City are cruising and Eddie Howe is desperately trying to find a remedy. Jordon Ibe and Dom Solanke are being readied. 65 min: Ag\u00fcero really is a class act, a goal machine and a complete striker. One of the best of the Premier League era, surely? Sergio Ag\u00fcero strikes \u2013 again. David Silva furrows into the box and Ag\u00fcero bustles his way through to give the Spaniard a helping hand. As the ball runs loose, the striker hammers in his second of the afternoon. That penalty appeal is already a distant memory. 61 min: No penalty, says VAR. Lerma, who was cautioned by Marriner moments earlier, did appear to impinge Silva in the box. Raheem Sterling flew to the byline, bamboozled Adam Smith and cut the ball back for Silva before the Spaniard went to ground. Lerma seemed to stand on Silva\u2019s right foot \u2013 but he gets away with it. Kevin Friend is this afternoon\u2019s VAR back at Stockley Park. 60 min: Pep Guardiola is adamant Manchester City should have a penalty. David Silva goes to ground but Andre Marriner shakes his head. He\u2019s having none of it. Jefferson Lerma appeared to trod on Silva\u2019s right foot. VAR is taking a look ... 59 min: Rodri\u2019s first touch is a good one, nicking the ball away on halfway before City stream forward down the right. Bernardo Silva cuts inside but the sting is taken out of his shot from the edge of the box, with Ak\u00e9, who has been superb, standing firm. 57 min: Pep Guardiola changes it up: \u0130lkay G\u00fcndogan is withdrawn and replaced by Rodri, a \u00a363m summer signing. 55 min: Another booking for Jefferson Lerma, who flies in on Kevin De Bruyne after the Manchester City midfielder skated away from Fraser. Lerma, the Colombia midfielder and club-record signing, earned 13 yellow cards last season. 53 min: De Bruyne dances his way into the box after good work by Ag\u00fcero but the former steers his shot wide of the Bournemouth goal. A let-off for the hosts, who moments earlier perhaps had an argument for a penalty. Laporte clipped Callum Wilson, who raced through on Ederson\u2019s goal. That challenge failed to unseat Wilson but the striker was unsteadied by it, with Ederson rushing out to block the forward\u2019s shot. As for the De Bruyne chance, Manchester City\u2019s supporters thought it was in. It was a wonderful break. 50 min: Zinchenko floats a dangerous ball into the box, it drops nicely for Raheem Sterling but the Bournemouth skipper Steve Cook throws his body on the line to prevent the City forward from doubling his tally for the afternoon. It was more joy for Zinchenko down the City left, with a high ball causing havoc at the back post but there was Cook to intervene. Magnificent defending. 49 min: David Silva slips in Sterling ... but Chris Mepham superbly ushers the England forward out and away from danger. Ramsdale applauds the work of the Wales defender. There is an air of confidence about Bournemouth. 47 min: The lively Harry Wilson nips the ball away from Zinchenko down the right, he drives forward and then as the winger releases Adam Smith, Sterling fells the Liverpool loanee. Andre Marriner waved advantage but Wilson was left in a heap. The home fans are incensed but the referee will argue Bournemouth failed to make the most of the advantage he awarded them. 46 min: Mepham clips Laporte, who is clutching his knee but the Manchester City man is up and moving. Charlie Daniels has reportedly gone to hospital with a suspected dislocated kneecap. Best wishes to the Bournemouth defender. 46 min: City get the second half started. No changes at the interval. A couple of half-time stats to get stuck into: Raheem Sterling has scored 11 goals in all competitions v Bournemouth, more than he has against any other opponent in his career. And, how about this gem, courtesy of Opta: since the start of last season, Harry Wilson has scored more goals from outside the box than any other player in the top four tiers of English football (11 in all competitions). Just as it seemed Manchester City were motoring away from Bournemouth, Harry Wilson stepped up to curl a delicious free-kick beyond Ederson to halve the half-time deficit. City were cruising after goals by Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Raheem Sterling but Wilson, a substitute after a serious-looking injury to Charlie Daniels, stepped up to bend a wonderful strike home in first-half stoppage-time. Bournemouth flew out of the blocks but soon came crashing back down to earth, with Ag\u00fcero taking the sting out of their positive start. Then Sterling raced on to a gorgeous David Silva pass to double City\u2019s lead. But it was Wilson that had the final say of the first half, teeing things up nicely for the next 45 minutes. An absolute peach. A postage-stamp free-kick. A beautiful left-footed strike by Harry Wilson, who bends the ball into the top corner beyond Ederson. Another stunning set-piece to add to the Wales winger\u2019s burgeoning showreel. 45+2 min: Laporte fouls Wilson 20 yards from goal. The Liverpool loanee Harry Wilson, who scored from distance last weekend and has scored spectacular free-kicks for fun, fancies it ... 45 min: There will be at least six minutes added time, the majority of which has been added on because of that injury to Charlie Daniels. The defender was carried off on a stretcher after going to ground awkwardly. This was only his second start since March after a knee injury kept him out of the run-in last season. In the blink of an eye, Raheem Sterling doubles City\u2019s advantage. Laporte switches play, picking out Bernardo Silva, who slips in David Silva, who then plays a wonderfully weighted ball into the box for Sterling, who speeds beyond Adam Smith and pokes the ball home. That\u2019s Sterling\u2019s 11th goal against Bournemouth and his eighth for the season. A marvellous City move. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side put five past West Ham on the opening weekend and, in this mood, you wouldn\u2019t bet against them running riot here either. 39 min: Adam Smith misses a sitter for Bournemouth! Manchester City make a total hash of a simple ball into the box, after a mix-up between Otamendi and Ederson gifts Bournemouth a wonderful opening. Harry Wilson dinked the ball into the box, Otamendi chested it straight to Smith but, luckily for City, Ederson manages to divert the defender\u2019s effort over. 37 min: Steve Cook launches a long throw into the area and it lands right in the heart of the Manchester City 18-yard box. There is Nathan Ak\u00e9 to meet it but the Dutchman cannot stab the ball goalwards. It was certainly a half chance. 35 min: Daniels is carried off on a stretcher, with both home and away supporters applauding as he is taken down the tunnel. It didn\u2019t look good, with the defender clutching his knee. Another headache for Eddie Howe, too, who is already without seven first-team players owing to injuries, including David Brooks. Harry Wilson, the Liverpool loanee, is on for his home debut. 33 min: A stretcher is needed for Daniels \u2013 it does not look good for the left-back. Harry Wilson will be coming on for Bournemouth. 31 min: Charlie Daniels looks very distressed. Billing spreads the ball wide and Daniels attempts to gallop on to his pass. But as he does, Daniels appears to go to ground awkwardly. He punches the ground in agony but the Bournemouth physio Steve Hard is on to try and suss out the situation. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s nothing too serious for a player who has only recently returned from a knee injury. 30 min: Even though Kevin De Bruyne scuffed his shot in the buildup to Ag\u00fcero opening the scoring, his contribution technically goes down as an assist. Which means the Belgium midfielder has reached 50 assists in the Premier League, achieving this milestone in the fewest appearances of any player in the competition\u2019s history (123 games). Not bad going, eh? 27 min: Eddie Howe is frantically trying to gee up his players to reinstate that belief. Adam Smith jets down the right flank and darts inside, slipping the ball in for Wilson but the striker gets himself in a tangle and the sniff of the City goal is gone. Guardiola\u2019s side hop straight up the other end and Bournemouth do well to crowd out Ag\u00fcero, with Ak\u00e9 preventing danger from escalating. 26 min: Ag\u00fcero presses Ramsdale and the Bournemouth goalkeeper skews a clearance into the mains stand. Bournemouth\u2019s confidence looks a little shot, as City begin to glide through the gears, upping the ante on a young defence. 23 min: Laporte plays a wondrous cross-field ball which Bernardo Silva picks up with ease. The Portuguese proceeds to skirt beyond Charlie Daniels before hooking the ball into the near post, where Bournemouth clear their lines. It is very much one-way traffic now after an encouraging start by the hosts. 19 min: Ramsdale saves from David Silva! Zinchenko\u2019s whipped ball from the left is only half-cleared by Charlie Daniels and the Spaniard picks up the seconds, but his relatively tame volley is kept out by the Bournemouth goalkeeper. 18 min: A deflating goal for Bournemouth to concede, with Eddie Howe\u2019s side punished for switching off in defence. Bournemouth began with a piercing tempo, with Wilson, King, Fraser and Ak\u00e9 enjoying forays forward but City have gradually assumed control of this match. They\u2019re knocking the ball about for fun, with the hosts powerless to do anything other than soak up possession. Zinchenko cuts the ball back for Kevin de Bruyne, who fluffs his lines inside the box but there is Sergio Ag\u00fcero to profit and sweep home. Ag\u00fcero simply passes the ball into the back of the net, his third league goal of the season. It was a move that was kickstarted by the peerless David Silva on his 400th City appearance, with the Spaniard freeing the overlapping Zinchenko. 13 min: And now Ederson charges into a reckless challenge! Fraser floats a neat ball into the channel for Wilson, who gallops on to it down the left flank. Ederson gets it all wrong and wipes the striker out a treat. The Manchester City goalkeeper earns a booking for his efforts. From the resulting free-kick, Bournemouth\u2019s Philip Billing collides with Ederson, with the City stopper a little fortunate the midfielder could not glance an effort on target. 10 min: Kyle Walker was fortunate to avoid a booking after a lunging challenge on Nathan Ak\u00e9 a few moments ago but this time Andre Marriner is forced into pulling a yellow card out of his pocket. Walker marauds forward with the ball at his feet but ends up overrunning it and Ak\u00e9 snuffs it out. As he does, Walker follows through and clatters through the Bournemouth defender. Walker has been heavily involved here and, in reality, has committed two bookable offences. A spicy start on the south coast. 9 min: Callum Wilson fails to retain possession on halfway and City pick the hosts off, with De Bruyne taking hold. He attempts to dink a ball over the top of the Bournemouth defence but it\u2019s wayward and Ramsdale hoovers things up. 6 min: Bernardo Silva sends a shot whistling past a post! Chris Mepham is half asleep as Sterling drives in behind his man and the winger cuts the ball back for the Portuguese, who wraps his foot around it first time \u2013 but it drops just wide of Aaron Ramsdale\u2019s left post. City are beginning to stretch their legs. 4 min: Kyle Walker should be booked for late lunge on Nathan Ak\u00e9. The Dutchman drives out of defence with De Bruyne for company before Walker goes to ground and sweeps the Bournemouth man off his feet. It was rash and Bournemouth earn a free-kick 45 yards or so, which Charlie Daniels swings in to little avail. 3 min: Wilson is penalised for tripping Zinchenko and Manchester City have time to compose themselves and get going. Zinchenko requires a dab of treatment after an earlier collision with Adam Smith led to a cut on his face. 1 min: Joshua King robs Kevin de Bruyne 25 yards out and drives towards goal \u2013 and gets a shot away. Ederson gathers comfortably but that\u2019s already more than Bournemouth mustered the last time these sides met. A positive start by Eddie Howe\u2019s men, operating in a 5-4-1. Ak\u00e9 hops into midfield when needed. Ryan Fraser gets Bournemouth under way on the south coast. The teams trudge out on to the turf. Steve Cook, the Bournemouth captain, together with his sons Frey and Eden, mascots for the day, leads his team through the pre-match handshakes. Sweet Caroline is blaring out over the speakers. Here we go, then! Ten minutes until kick-off in Dorset. Any pre-match thoughts or feelings? \u201cAs a Liverpool fan I was hoping that Harry Wilson would start,\u201d emails Mike MacKenzie. \u201cDo you think he has a path to first team on Liverpool given ages of front three? He\u2019s 22 now whereas Ben Woodburn is turns 20 in October.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp is a big fan but, perhaps a little like Danny Ings, maybe there will come a time where all parties decide that it might be best for him to play regular football away from Anfield. That there is no option for Bournemouth to make the loan move permanent is perhaps another indicator of the love for him on Merseyside \u2013 but there is no doubting the difficulty of displacing Klopp\u2019s tormenting trio. Pep Guardiola talks. \u201cAway it is always tough, especially in the beginning of the season when people are still not settled,\u201d he says. \u201cHere it is always tough, the quality of the opponent, a typical English football stadium and they are so fast up front with [Ryan] Fraser, [Joshua] King and [Callum] Wilson.\u201d On David Silva, who is making his 400th appearance in a Manchester City shirt, Guardiola adds: \u201cHe has to be super proud, and I\u2019m sure he is.\u201d As for the 27C heat, Howe says the pitch will be sticky but is confident Bournemouth are fit enough to cope. It is a scorching day on the south coast, where Raheem Sterling is looking to keep up a fine goalscoring run. The England international has found the net four games in a row and will be licking his lips at facing Steve Cook and Chris Mepham, given that the forward has scored eight goals (and two assists) in seven games against Bournemouth. \u201cRaheem Sterling has done well against us in recent seasons, he\u2019s an outstanding talent,\u201d says Eddie Howe, the Bournemouth manager. \u201cYou look through their team and they\u2019ve got so much quality so we\u2019ll have plenty of players to keep quiet. A big thing for us will be the crowd. The players bounce off the crowd and we\u2019re really hopeful of a good atmosphere to help us.\u201d Pep Guardiola has been having a pre-match chinwag with Sandbanks\u2019 Harry Redknapp, a regular in the stands at his former club. The Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser has also been doing some talking before the main event. \u201cWe need to be on top of our game today,\u201d says the flying Scotsman. \u201cWe need to defend well but also impose ourselves on the game and play our football. It will be a difficult game but one we are relishing.\u201d Team news news: Pep Guardiola gives Fernandinho a breather, with \u0130lkay G\u00fcndogan replacing the Brazilian in that holding midfield role, while Rodri is also on the bench. David Silva captains City on his 400th appearance for the club. In terms of Bournemouth, it is a big afternoon for Nathan Ak\u00e9, who has been promoted from defence into midfield, with the Dutchman tasked with hoovering up in a Fernandinho-type role. Harry Wilson, who scored on his debut at Aston Villa last weekend, drops to the bench as Chris Mepham returns. Bournemouth\u2019s club captain, Simon Francis, says: \u201cWe can go out there with a fearlessness and attack them, and hopefully get the result we want because it is the one team lingering there that we still haven\u2019t taken any points off of.\u201d Bournemouth (4-1-4-1): Ramsdale; Smith, Mepham, Cook, Daniels; Ak\u00e9; King, Lerma, Billing, Fraser; C Wilson Subs: Boruc, Simpson, Rico, Surman, H Wilson, Ibe, Solanke Manchester City (4-1-4-1): Ederson; Walker, Laporte, Otamendi, Zinchenko; G\u00fcndogan; B Silva, De Bruyne, D Silva, Sterling; Ag\u00fcero Subs: Bravo, Angeli\u00f1o, Rodri, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Cancelo, Foden Referee: Andre Marriner On the receiving end of 5-1 defeat in their first meeting before three 4-0 humblings, something had to change and, when Bournemouth shut up shop last season, it almost garnered their first points against a peerless Manchester City. Eddie Howe and his team took plenty of flak \u2013 no shots, no corners and 17.9% possession fuelled plenty of conversation \u2013 but the reality is Bournemouth almost eked out a precious and unprecedented point against the champions. Still, their timeline against City reads eight matches and eight defeats, and Guardiola\u2019s side lead by an aggregate score of 25-3. \u201cWe have to use that record to inspire us in the game,\u201d Howe said. \u201cWe try and embrace these challenges and not fearfully. We lost 3-1 away and the game here was very tight but we felt we were competitive without showing our best attributes. I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re getting closer but results will dictate that.\u201d City\u2019s VAR-induced draw against Tottenham last time out ended a run of 15 successive top-flight victories dating back to January and it is difficult to envisage them failing to heed victory on the south coast. David Silva is set to make his 400th appearance in a City shirt, while John Stones is missing for the visitors. \u201cHe is one of the most incredible intelligent players in the small spaces,\u201d Guardiola said of Silva. \u201cHe is one of the best I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s not just the quality, he\u2019s a huge competitor in the training matches. As for Bournemouth, who come into the game on the back of victory at Aston Villa, Howe has a raft of long-term absentees, namely David Brooks, who joined City as a seven-year-old boy, but Joshua King and Callum Wilson are capable of causing havoc. Kick-off: 2pm (BST)",

The Conservative MP Rachel Maclean was the first to speak out about it in the House of Commons and has been campaigning to normalise menopause as a workplace issue.</p> \n<p>She said she wants women to be able to have time off or change shift patterns or conditions of work when they need relief from symptoms that often go well beyond the stereotypical hot flushes and night sweats.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ecf80ac3-30ef-410b-b005-1463dcde27c5\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.</p>\n    <p>Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Symptoms can begin months or years before periods stop \u2013 this time is called the perimenopause \u2013 and can last around four years after the last period. However, some women have them for much longer, with 10% experiencing symptoms for up to 12 years.</p>\n    <p>About 25% of women experience such severe symptoms that they can be diagnosed with mental health problems. The principal treatment is hormone replacement therapy, which can control symptoms well, but does increase the chances of breast and ovarian cancer.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI absolutely agree that employers need to do more.

It is very difficult for women at work often.\u201d She said she had heard many \u201chorrific and heart-rending\u201d accounts.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy central message is: menopause is the last taboo because it is still hidden and it only affects women and it only affects older women. It\u2019s ageism, it\u2019s sexism, all rolled into one.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris said she believed that if legislation was required, it would be passed by MPs. There was \u201ctremendous support\u201d across the benches when the house debated the issue recently, \u201cespecially from men whose wives have been through it. They understand.\u201d</p> \n<p>About 80% of women experience some symptoms of the menopause, brought about when ovulation stops as a result of hormone levels dropping. One in four have severe symptoms, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to them being diagnosed with mental health problems and prescribed drugs.</p> \n<p>Harris told of going to see a GP in 2010 after she had treatment for a gynaecological condition. \u201cI was having a nervous breakdown,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really depressed and had mental health issues. I think that\u2019s down to the fact I was going through the menopause.

      "bodyText": "British MPs are pushing for clear workplace policies to protect women going through the menopause, which exacts a hefty personal and professional toll on as many as one in four females. A menopause policy should be as commonplace as maternity schemes in businesses and organisations, said the MPs, some of whom want legislation to force through the reforms. Women have told the Guardian how their careers have been ruined by symptoms such as anxiety, confusion and loss of confidence. Some have faced disciplinary action and many have been forced to take time off, while others have sold their homes so they can afford to work part-time or stop working altogether. The Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dream of having a workplace where people weren\u2019t entitled to certain things because they were pregnant, and it\u2019s exactly the same for women with the menopause. I firmly believe there should be legislation to make sure every workplace has a menopause policy, just like they have a maternity policy.\u201d The often unspoken impact of menopause on women at work has become a cross-party issue. The Conservative MP Rachel Maclean was the first to speak out about it in the House of Commons and has been campaigning to normalise menopause as a workplace issue. She said she wants women to be able to have time off or change shift patterns or conditions of work when they need relief from symptoms that often go well beyond the stereotypical hot flushes and night sweats. \u201cI absolutely agree that employers need to do more. It\u2019s not well understood,\u201d Maclean said. \u201cEmployees don\u2019t get the support they need. It is very difficult for women at work often.\u201d She said she had heard many \u201chorrific and heart-rending\u201d accounts. \u201cMy central message is: menopause is the last taboo because it is still hidden and it only affects women and it only affects older women. It\u2019s ageism, it\u2019s sexism, all rolled into one.\u201d Harris said she believed that if legislation was required, it would be passed by MPs. There was \u201ctremendous support\u201d across the benches when the house debated the issue recently, \u201cespecially from men whose wives have been through it. They understand.\u201d About 80% of women experience some symptoms of the menopause, brought about when ovulation stops as a result of hormone levels dropping. One in four have severe symptoms, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to them being diagnosed with mental health problems and prescribed drugs. Harris told of going to see a GP in 2010 after she had treatment for a gynaecological condition. \u201cI was having a nervous breakdown,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really depressed and had mental health issues. I think that\u2019s down to the fact I was going through the menopause. So many women end up on antidepressants or being told to pull themselves together.\u201d Amanda Griffiths, a professor of occupational health psychology at the University of Nottingham who has done substantial research on the impact of the menopause on working women, said it had \u201cquite a significant impact\u201d on the personal and professional lives of up to a quarter of women. She said women made up an increasing proportion of the ageing workforce. \u201cFor me there is a big issue here, which is not just about women having problems with menopause. It is about managers understanding it is perfectly normal for us to have health problems,\u201d she said. There needed to be an atmosphere at work where people could talk about health, she said, \u201cinstead of which we tend to have this fear in some organisations that if we have a health condition there will be some sort of stigma attached to it\u201d. Two separate surveys of women going through the menopause and perimenopause \u2013 the time leading up to when ovulation stops \u2013 found they were struggling in work and felt unsupported by managers. In one survey of more than 1,100 women, undertaken by the menopause clinic Newson Health and published last month, 94% said they felt their work had suffered as a result of their symptoms, and 53% said their colleagues had noticed a deterioration in their performance. Just over half had taken time off sick, and one in 10 had missed more than eight weeks of work. A separate survey by the shop workers\u2019 union Usdaw found that one in five women had taken time off work and that more than half did not feel able to approach their managers if they were suffering. In the Newson Health survey, more than a third said their employer did not offer any kind of discussion group, awareness session or training on the subject of menopause, despite there being more than 5 million working women aged between 45 and 60. Dr Rebecca Lewis, a GP who works at Newson Health, said: \u201cWomen are suffering quietly for fear of saying \u2018it\u2019s the menopause\u2019 and being laughed at and told to get on with it. \u201cA GP might not think to put it down, or the woman might not want it put down because of a feeling that it\u2019s not a \u2018proper\u2019 illness.\u201d Sue Hackett, the London regional equality officer at the GMB union, said: \u201cIt is high time we stop treating menstruation and menopause as taboo subjects. Women have put up with insulting comments and a woeful lack of provision for far too long for what is a completely natural condition.\u201d She said workplace policies around sickness absence or performance management could unfairly penalise women \u201cbecause of key symptoms like memory loss or lack of concentration\u201d. Unions said there were examples of good practice in workplaces. In 2017, Nottinghamshire police introduced a menopause policy and issued guidance to managers saying they could consider requests from women who needed to adjust their uniform or their working hours. Among other practical support, it recommended access to private areas where women could \u201crest temporarily, cry or talk with a colleague before they can return to their workspace\u201d. The Welsh government has put in place guidance for its workers. It said: \u201cAll reasonable adjustments will be considered when a health issue may be impacting on a person\u2019s ability to carry out their role \u2013 this can include changing working location or conditions for a more comfortable working life.\u201d Unfair dismissal case Last year an employment tribunal judge found in favour of Mandy Davies, a court officer working for the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service who was dismissed after an incident involving medication she was taking. Davies alleged that under the 2010 Equality Act she had been unfairly dismissed and discriminated against as a result of a disability. The tribunal heard how she had been suffering from symptoms including heavy bleeding, memory loss and confusion, and that she had previously had a 20-year unblemished employment record. Her employer accepted that the menopause was a disability, but argued it had not unfairly dismissed her as a consequence, a position the judge did not accept, ruling that she should be reinstated and paid \u00a314,000. The court service is appealing against the decision.",

It was just as if my internal thermostat had broken, in an instant. From then on, for the next six years the heat would come over me with no warning. Like a whoosh, like a flare, like a furnace. Slowly, confusingly, I stopped feeling like \u2018myself\u2019. I couldn\u2019t pin it down or put it into words, just a feeling that I was outside of myself or just not in touch with my old self. Then I put a layer of chunky fat on around my waist in almost no time at all. From then on I felt I had become old and (worst of all) invisible. I couldn\u2019t work out what was real or imagined but I knew for sure that I really disliked my new self. Grumpy, short-tempered, anxious. The best GP I saw told me I was coping extremely well with a very difficult set of symptoms and made me cry with his kindness. I was never dismissed or belittled. I tried a mild tranquilliser (gave me tummy ache), HRT patches (brought back bleeding) and black cohosh (pointless). Then in a period of revelation and enlightenment, I joined the gym and upped the aerobic exercise. Over the next few weeks the flushes stopped, my mood lifted, I dropped a couple of pounds and the \u2018old me\u2019 gradually came back. <strong>Rachel, 59, Kent</strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>I took early retirement</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>My main sense is of embarrassment, but I am most interested in the shame attached to it, which is a deeper emotion than simply embarrassment.

      "bodyText": "Not so long ago, Paula Kennedy was a vice-principal at a school in London, enjoying the buzz of the classroom and the challenges of management. In September, she will return to school as a part-time teacher, the symptoms of the menopause having forced her to step back from a role she loved. \u201cBy the time I hit my 40s I was back in full-time work and was working in leadership positions in schools \u2026 I had experience of teaching and I had life experience, which made me a good manager,\u201d she said. \u201cThen suddenly I thought: \u2018I can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d \u201cMy confidence just completely went. Whereas before I would have stuck up for myself and been more assertive, I felt unable to. Nobody said: \u2018You\u2019re doing a bad job,\u2019 the pressure was coming from me. I couldn\u2019t get any perspective.\u201d Instead of walking the corridors with confidence, she said she would sometimes find herself feeling tearful. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good look. Nobody wants to look in and see a deputy head crying in her office.\u201d Kennedy, who plans to start an MA in counselling, said she hoped to support other women going through the same thing. Women such as Lisa Williams, from Dalton, Cumbria. After spending 30 years working in high-pressure jobs, Williams is signed off sick as a result of symptoms of the perimenopause, the time leading up to when a woman\u2019s periods stop. \u2018I want people to know\u2019 \u201cWhen I was about 45 I started to feel really stressed with work \u2013 I felt quite anxious and overwhelmed by it,\u201d she said. \u201cI put it down to workplace stress. There were a lot of changes: I was working in a new team, then my manager went off sick and was replaced, then the replacement went off sick. They were stressed and I thought I was too.\u201d She was signed off for a couple of months, and returned on a reduced basis, working alongside the person who had been covering for her. \u201cI did not even have half of my old job to do but I still felt overwhelmed,\u201d she said. \u201cI had always been very good at organising things but I couldn\u2019t organise myself. My memory had gone and I felt confused.\u201d Worried she had dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Williams saw several GPs. Antidepressants were recommended, but she did not feel depressed. Williams eventually realised what the issue was after finding a group of women sharing their symptoms online. She and her husband decided to pay for private doctor, who prescribed hormone replacement therapy. This solved some of the symptoms but has not helped with the feeling of being overwhelmed. \u201cI\u2019m the first in my workforce to say that I\u2019m off because of the menopause \u2013 that\u2019s what it says on my sick note.

However, Williams is worried other managers will not want her and the couple are moving house to reduce their costs in case Lisa is unable to work as much in future. \u201cI miss what I used to be like,\u201d she said. \u2018I woke up a completely different person\u2019 Dozens of other women got in touch with the Guardian about their menopause experiences, the vast majority requesting anonymity about their cases in a sign that it is still considered a social taboo. One, who experienced the menopause in her 40s after an operation, is facing disciplinary action for her work attendance. She said she was warned to expect some symptoms, but the impact on her health and her work in a hospital had been devastating. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for any of it.

Purists will argue that winning rugby league\u2019s oldest prize at Wembley is indeed the big one but it is understandable why everyone associated with the Wolves values the league as the one that really matters, given they have not been crowned champions since 1955.</p> <p>Price\u2019s ambition is shared by his chief executive, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the desire to be the biggest club in Super League, and we know that to be regarded in that way, we have to win the league,\u201d Karl Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThis club wants to win the double this year, make no mistake about it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/st-helens-warrington-rugby-league-challenge-cup-final-match-report\">Warrington feast on St Helens errors to seal shock Challenge Cup triumph</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ending their recent hoodoo in finals certainly reaffirms the belief that they can push for the double this season. To do that, they must first address their horrendous league form: five consecutive defeats have taken them from being play-off certainties to racing numerous others for a top-five spot.</p> <p>Winning at Wembley against the red-hot favourites and runaway league leaders certainly provides confidence aplenty for the run-in, though. \u201cI think the performance and execution of the gameplan will go down in history,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Steve and the focus has already turned to Salford on Thursday night.

With Price at the helm for the foreseeable future, however, Fitzpatrick sees no reason why his plan to take the Wolves to the top of the sport cannot come to fruition. \u201cA golden era? Who knows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been there or thereabouts but winning this after losing six straight finals certainly sheds a bit of the reputation we\u2019d probably picked up. I think we can get stronger, too; we were without our marquee player in Blake Austin and we\u2019ve young players who will get better. This has to be the start, not the end.\u201d</p> <p>But what of Price?

      "bodyText": "Barely an hour had passed since perhaps the greatest victory of Warrington\u2019s modern history and Steve Price was already keen to look ahead. After the Wolves\u2019 defeat in six consecutive major finals before Saturday\u2019s 18-4 success in the Challenge Cup final against St Helens, few would have begrudged Price and his players the opportunity to celebrate for at least a few days: not least Salford, their Super League opponents on Thursday. Yet the message from the Warrington coach was clear. \u201cWe\u2019re going for that big one now,\u201d he insisted. Purists will argue that winning rugby league\u2019s oldest prize at Wembley is indeed the big one but it is understandable why everyone associated with the Wolves values the league as the one that really matters, given they have not been crowned champions since 1955. Price\u2019s ambition is shared by his chief executive, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the desire to be the biggest club in Super League, and we know that to be regarded in that way, we have to win the league,\u201d Karl Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThis club wants to win the double this year, make no mistake about it.\u201d Ending their recent hoodoo in finals certainly reaffirms the belief that they can push for the double this season. To do that, they must first address their horrendous league form: five consecutive defeats have taken them from being play-off certainties to racing numerous others for a top-five spot. Winning at Wembley against the red-hot favourites and runaway league leaders certainly provides confidence aplenty for the run-in, though. \u201cI think the performance and execution of the gameplan will go down in history,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Steve and the focus has already turned to Salford on Thursday night. There are going to be some sore bodies but we\u2019ve got the belief.\u201d Warrington have threatened to dominate British rugby league on several occasions in recent years but their failure to win a Grand Final has prevented that from happening. With Price at the helm for the foreseeable future, however, Fitzpatrick sees no reason why his plan to take the Wolves to the top of the sport cannot come to fruition. \u201cA golden era? Who knows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been there or thereabouts but winning this after losing six straight finals certainly sheds a bit of the reputation we\u2019d probably picked up. I think we can get stronger, too; we were without our marquee player in Blake Austin and we\u2019ve young players who will get better. This has to be the start, not the end.\u201d But what of Price? It is typical for successful Australian coaches in Super League to return home to the NRL at some point and Fitzpatrick admits his coach may well be no different. However, with the 41-year-old under contract for at least two more years, there is the opportunity for Price and his squad to create a serious legacy. \u201cWe moved very quickly to extend his deal last year,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cHis attention to detail is incredible. He delivered a coaching masterclass on Saturday but above all else, Steve is a very loyal guy. There were rumours about him going home last year when we were discussing an extension but we shook on a deal and he was true to his word.\u201d Price\u2019s name has already been mentioned with one soon-to-be vacant role in Australia. Newcastle are looking for a new coach and Saturday\u2019s success will only further strengthen his credentials. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been approached by them \u2013 as I say, he\u2019s a loyal guy and that\u2019s a nonstarter as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Fitzpatrick added. Warrington will celebrate Saturday\u2019s success with a homecoming parade in the town on Monday.

I have a 14-year-old daughter who wears our stuff. It is more of a mindset than a specific age.\u201d</p> <p>Hush\u2019s rapid success has seen the company take over a maze of units in an unglamorous business park in Battersea, south London, where the rumbling of trains on the nearby main line provides a constant soundtrack. Watkins still oversees all the brand\u2019s photoshoots \u2013 although these days the locations are closer to home as the couple juggle the parenting demands of their two children \u2013 while Youngman looks after the marketing and e-commerce.</p> <p>\u201cOur catalogues have always been about taking a lovely shot rather than having the model show off every feature of the product,\u201d she says. \u201cMy points of reference [as an Australian] are different.

This month\u2019s rescue of Karen Millen and Coast by the internet fashion group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/boohoo\">Boohoo</a> will mean the closure of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/06/boohoo-move-for-karen-millen-and-coast-puts-1100-jobs-at-risk\">200 UK outlets</a> as they morph into online brands.</p> <p>Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, says part of the problem is that high street fashion brands have become \u201ctoo corporate\u201d: \u201cThese smaller brands [like Hush] are taking off because even though there is a massive oversupply of fashion, there is not genuine choice. It\u2019s all very boring and the same. The big players are not commercial enough, their leadership teams are too far from the coal face.\u201d</p> <p>Watkins and Youngman, who like to spend their holidays going surfing with their kids, are certainly still turning up at the coal face every day. \u201cWe remember when Hush was a startup but even now mentally that\u2019s exactly how we feel,\u201d says Youngman of the business that now employs 126 people.</p> <p>\u201cEvery single part of Hush is personal,\u201d adds Watkins. \u201cIt comes from here,\u201d she says, touching her heart: \u201cTreat customers and staff the way you\u2019d like to treated and you can\u2019t go too far wrong with that.\u201d</p>",

In 2003, she used a \u00a340,000 redundancy cheque to start the company from her kitchen table, and says the relaxed Hush style reflects the way women dress in her homeland. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but make it about you,\u201d explains Watkins, who moved to Britain to be with her now-husband Rupert Youngman, who is the company\u2019s managing director. \u201cThere is a large element of me \u2013 me with longer, slimmer legs, the younger me, the older me. I have a 14-year-old daughter who wears our stuff. It is more of a mindset than a specific age.\u201d Hush\u2019s rapid success has seen the company take over a maze of units in an unglamorous business park in Battersea, south London, where the rumbling of trains on the nearby main line provides a constant soundtrack. Watkins still oversees all the brand\u2019s photoshoots \u2013 although these days the locations are closer to home as the couple juggle the parenting demands of their two children \u2013 while Youngman looks after the marketing and e-commerce. \u201cOur catalogues have always been about taking a lovely shot rather than having the model show off every feature of the product,\u201d she says. \u201cMy points of reference [as an Australian] are different. There\u2019s a British [fashion] aesthetic and a lot of British brands are doing that look and maybe ours is a bit different.\u201d The online retailer, which also has concessions in John Lewis and a small number of pop-up stores, started out selling pyjamas and cardigans but these days covers all wardrobe bases, and its dresses cost an average of about \u00a380. Sales at Hush increased by 35% to \u00a340.3m in the year to the end of March but pre-tax profits fell back from \u00a35.4m to \u00a34.8m as the growing business invested in technology and expanded its head office. \u201cWe got to the point where we couldn\u2019t continue to do it all ourselves,\u201d explains Youngman of the business that is still 100% owned by the couple. Hush recently hired its first sustainability and ethics coordinator and is also working with the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at the London College of Fashion, holding workshops for its staff. \u201cWe\u2019re quite a sustainable brand in the first place because we\u2019re not trend-led, but we decided we needed to educate ourselves quickly and catch up with the sustainable brands entering the market,\u201d explains Watkins. The online brand is succeeding at a time when fashion retailers with large store networks are being felled by rising costs as fewer shoppers opt to visit the high street. This month\u2019s rescue of Karen Millen and Coast by the internet fashion group Boohoo will mean the closure of their 200 UK outlets as they morph into online brands. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, says part of the problem is that high street fashion brands have become \u201ctoo corporate\u201d: \u201cThese smaller brands [like Hush] are taking off because even though there is a massive oversupply of fashion, there is not genuine choice. It\u2019s all very boring and the same. The big players are not commercial enough, their leadership teams are too far from the coal face.\u201d Watkins and Youngman, who like to spend their holidays going surfing with their kids, are certainly still turning up at the coal face every day. \u201cWe remember when Hush was a startup but even now mentally that\u2019s exactly how we feel,\u201d says Youngman of the business that now employs 126 people. \u201cEvery single part of Hush is personal,\u201d adds Watkins. \u201cIt comes from here,\u201d she says, touching her heart: \u201cTreat customers and staff the way you\u2019d like to treated and you can\u2019t go too far wrong with that.\u201d",

The term \u201cgym\u201d refers to the membership model rather than the well-evidenced mind-body benefits of throwing clay \u2013 you can pay a not-inconsiderable \u00a3165 a month for a one-year contract that gives you access to materials at cost price, as well as a set of technicians who can help with the exacting glazing and firing process (other membership options are available). A number of studios have since opened along similar lines, including <a href=\"https://www.claystudio.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Clay Studio in Manchester</a>; meanwhile, the BBC is relaunching its craft contest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/03/great-pottery-throw-down-review-sara-cox\" title=\"\">The Great Pottery Throwdown</a>.</p> <p> It is not hard to see why pottery may appeal in these hyperconnected, terminally distracted times. It is literally impossible to look at your phone while you are making a pot. If you try to sneak a look at your mentions between throws, your phone will quickly become smirched in clay. Also, as Maughan notes, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/09/mental-health-crisis-generation-rent-millennials-own-home-wellbeing\" title=\"\">generation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/09/mental-health-crisis-generation-rent-millennials-own-home-wellbeing\" title=\"\">rent</a>\u201d was brought up on home-renovation programmes \u2013 but a lot of us don\u2019t own homes. \u201cPottery is something small and manageable that connects to that idea of home.\u201d</p> <p>Social media has helped potters to establish low-overhead businesses \u2013 ceramicists such as Tom Kemp (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tom_kemp_/\" title=\"\">@tom_kemp_</a>) and Stine Dulong (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/skandihus_london/\" title=\"\">@skandihus_london</a>) command huge followings on Instagram.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/13/debut-novelists-of-2019-interviews-bev-thomas\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Macneal</a>, the author of the bestselling novel The Doll Factory, has been selling the pots she makes in what used to be her writing shed for three years, mostly through Instagram (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elizabethmacneal/\" title=\"\">@elizabethmacneal</a>). In 2016, while working as a management consultant, she found herself drifting into a pottery class during a project in Edinburgh. She soon became addicted. \u201cThere were about 100 people on the project I was working on. I had no idea what I was even supposed to be doing. But, with pottery, you are solely responsible for how it turns out. That\u2019s so inviting when you\u2019re disaffected by your job.\u201d</p> <p>She finds that writing and throwing pots complement one another. \u201cWhen I\u2019m writing, sometimes it feels as if I\u2019m not getting anywhere \u2013 I can delete a month\u2019s work in about 10 seconds. But then I can go to the shed, throw 10 mugs and have something to show for it. It\u2019s almost the opposite of writing. It\u2019s mechanical and it\u2019s repetitive, so you can let your mind wander. I often work out plot points that way and I like that primarily it\u2019s functional. It\u2019s relaxing.

It\u2019s not in schools any more. And it\u2019s such an antidote to the technological onslaught that has become the norm. It\u2019s a very old thing, clay. People often say they feel like they\u2019ve been in a spa for a full day.\u201d</p> <p>Pottery, she suggests, challenges our post-industrial ideas about art, where we outsource all creativity and handiwork to a few specialists. \u201cPeople often show up for classes protesting that they\u2019re not creative, but they end up really surprised at what they\u2019ve been able to make. Creativity is like a muscle. Children love to create. But unless you make a point of doing it as a grownup, it withers. The idea is that everyone is welcome there. It\u2019s suitable for little babies up to elderly people.\u201d</p> <p>For Maughan, who is writing a book on pottery, to be published next year, the connection goes back even further. \u201cCeramics is the oldest form of technology we have,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter cooking meat, baking clay was the first thing that humans did to chemically alter our environment on purpose. You can\u2019t make rice without cooking it in some kind of vessel, so clay pots go hand in hand with agriculture \u2013 our whole evolution is connected to it. There\u2019s only a short period of history in which people haven\u2019t been connected with pottery. There\u2019s something incredibly grounding about an experience that connects you with the past like that.\u201d</p> <p>Maughan echoes the views of William Morris, the Arts and Crafts designer and socialist activist, who was born in 1834 not far from the site of Turning Earth E10. He argued that making beautiful things should be seen as a fundamental human need. \u201cI do not want art for a few, any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few,\u201d he wrote in Hopes and Fears for Art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e320ef65883f92f2c983c2a70e3303e636c99c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e320ef65883f92f2c983c2a70e3303e636c99c5/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turning Earth pottery 'gym'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I find it quite meditative\u2019 ... potters at the wheel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Maughan welcomes pottery\u2019s popularity \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/ceramics-pottery-therapeutic-benefits-mindfulness-meditation\" title=\"\">US Vogue has declared it \u201cthe new yoga\u201d</a> and it has, perhaps inevitably, become the latest mindfulness trend in Silicon Valley \u2013 she is determined to ensure it doesn\u2019t end up as \u201ca middle-class hobby\u201d, even if the associated costs clearly push it in that direction. \u201cI am political; I did this for political reasons,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s called Turning Earth for that reason. We shouldn\u2019t think of objects as nameless, faceless things, detached from process. We should think about how they got there, what their impact is and who was involved.\u201d</p> <p>Her vocation is deep-rooted. She grew up with her mother in Rutland; her childhood involved no central heating, but lots of home-curing and potato-farming. \u201cMy dad died when I was six. My mum was quite an eccentric person who felt she needed to prepare us for a post-apocalyptic world. She had a pottery wheel and kiln in the conservatory. She formed her own Saturday morning pottery class and made me and my brother go every week.\u201d</p> <p>Maughan wasn\u2019t especially keen at the time, but when she took a pottery course as an adult she found it gave her an \u201calmost mystical feeling\u201d that was sorely lacking in her day job. She was then working as a corporate social responsibility consultant \u2013 advising multinational companies on how they could be more green and ethical \u2013 but she had become deeply disillusioned. \u201cThe whole thing came out of me thinking about climate change and feeling that we had to do something drastically different as a society,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may seem counterintuitive, but I realised that we needed to start creating sustainable activities that people actually want to do, rather than trying to fix a system that was broken. If you look at the root cause of climate change, it\u2019s unsustainable consumption. Why do people consume so much? The main reason is they\u2019re not happy. So, what makes people happy? Once you start asking those questions, it inevitably leads you to questions about the inequity in society.\u201d</p> <p>She notes that her studios have proved popular partly due to the squeezing of further education colleges. \u201cOne of the reasons we didn\u2019t have this sort of culture before is that we\u2019re used to having state-funded arts programmes, which has led to many people seeing art as a parasite and not something that can be an economic contributor.\u201d She is committed to creating \u201cart in the black\u201d \u2013 art that funds itself \u2013 but balancing this aim with her desire to bring pottery to as wide an audience as possible clearly has its challenges. The next Turning Earth studio will be in Battersea, south-west London, in partnership with Big Yellow Storage and Wandsworth council, which will allow Maughan to offer funded places. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do things like that, it will end up as one of those gentrification projects that divide society. We don\u2019t want it to be that.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pottery can\u2019t help but feel miraculous: a lump of mud, set spinning on a wheel, transformed by motion and friction into something useful. \u201cA potter is one of the few people left who uses his natural faculties of heart, head and hand in balance \u2013 the whole man,\u201d wrote Bernard Leach, the father of British studio pottery. \u201cGood pots require the ardour of vocation and the devotion of a lifetime.\u201d No doubt. But on a first lesson at Turning Earth E10 \u2013 a 790 sq metre (8,500 sq ft), collective-run \u201cpottery gym\u201d on an industrial estate in Leyton, east London \u2013 a passable pot is just about doable in a morning. It requires about half a kilo of clay and a patient teacher, Natalie Smith, a relatively recent convert herself. Like many 21st-century potters, she uses Instagram (@throwing_pots) as a shop window for her fermentation jars and teapots. Sun streams through the skylights on to a scene of blissful purpose, decorated with Extinction Rebellion posters. A highly focused man at the next wheel is rippling through a Japanese-style dinner service with impressively slender walls; a recently retired woman paints a vase with a little more visible effort. Smith runs me through basics of water and pressure, the rituals of kneading the clay, positioning it on the wheel, \u201cconing\u201d up and down to ensure the clay is dead-centre. \u201cThis part drives people crazy to begin with,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I find it quite meditative.\u201d Then comes the miraculous part, thumbing out a little hole, tickling out a wall. Each pot has an element of happenstance. You might end up with something vaguely urn-like and pretend that is what you were aiming for all along. You might accidentally step on the pedal \u2013 a common mistake \u2013 and watch your little miracle lurch back into mud. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we recycle all the clay,\u201d Smith assures me. I first noticed the re-emergence of pottery as a popular hobby while living in Los Angeles a couple of years ago: a friend invested in a wheel and began hosting ceramics-themed parties.

      "body": "<p>\u201cO gentle sleep! / Nature\u2019s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee / That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down.\u201d Henry IV, as portrayed by Shakespeare, would have sympathised with people who struggle with insomnia. Now a major publisher has come up with a novel idea \u2013 audiobooks with such soothing sounds as soft rainfall and lapping water to relax the listener and send them off to sleep.</p> <p>In a project to be launched this week, Penguin Random House has collaborated with the Sleep Council and the Children\u2019s Sleep Charity in creating collections of \u201cSleep Tales\u201d for adults and children.</p> <p>Combining \u201ccutting-edge technology and the ancient art of storytelling to help solve an age-old problem\u201d, these audiobooks are part soundscape, part descriptive narrative, with softly spoken voices to calm anxieties and take listeners to the land of nod.</p> <p>Chronic insomnia, in which individuals have difficulties dropping off or staying asleep at least three nights a week for three months or more, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/30/insomnia-sufferers-can-benefit-from-therapy-new-study-shows\">is thought to affect about 10-15% of adults.</a></p> <p>The Guardian analysed data from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> Digital, the health service\u2019s data provider in England, showing admissions of those aged 16 and under with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder rose from 6,520 in 2012-13 to 9,429 last year.</p> <p>One audiobook story, titled Wakarango Mai, takes listeners to a paradise setting, New Zealand\u2019s hot springs at Lake Taupo. Against a distant soundscape of chirping birds and lapping water, the narrator Sally Scott sets the scene: \u201cThis huge shiny expanse of water isn\u2019t far from civilisation in terms of miles and yet, when you enter this ancient place, the bustling modern city is left behind, as if it ceases to exist at all, leaving with it all your stress and worries \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Each story lasts about 15 minutes, enabling listeners to set their sleep timer.</p> <p>The stories draw on the Sleep Council\u2019s research into sounds that help people wind down, such as waves lapping on a shore, soft rainfall and birdsong.</p> <p>Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio, told the Guardian the project was inspired partly by the realisation that increasing numbers of people were listening to audiobooks \u201cas they\u2019re going to sleep or as part of their bedtime routine\u201d.</p> <p>He said both adults and children respond to something comforting and familiar as they are nodding off.</p> <p>These are tales without a beginning, a middle or an end, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s being described to you, rather than a story that\u2019s being told to you \u2026 Nothing happens that jolts you.\u201d</p> <p>There are no authors\u2019 names.

      "bodyText": "\u201cO gentle sleep! / Nature\u2019s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee / That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down.\u201d Henry IV, as portrayed by Shakespeare, would have sympathised with people who struggle with insomnia. Now a major publisher has come up with a novel idea \u2013 audiobooks with such soothing sounds as soft rainfall and lapping water to relax the listener and send them off to sleep. In a project to be launched this week, Penguin Random House has collaborated with the Sleep Council and the Children\u2019s Sleep Charity in creating collections of \u201cSleep Tales\u201d for adults and children. Combining \u201ccutting-edge technology and the ancient art of storytelling to help solve an age-old problem\u201d, these audiobooks are part soundscape, part descriptive narrative, with softly spoken voices to calm anxieties and take listeners to the land of nod. Chronic insomnia, in which individuals have difficulties dropping off or staying asleep at least three nights a week for three months or more, is thought to affect about 10-15% of adults. The Guardian analysed data from NHS Digital, the health service\u2019s data provider in England, showing admissions of those aged 16 and under with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder rose from 6,520 in 2012-13 to 9,429 last year. One audiobook story, titled Wakarango Mai, takes listeners to a paradise setting, New Zealand\u2019s hot springs at Lake Taupo. Against a distant soundscape of chirping birds and lapping water, the narrator Sally Scott sets the scene: \u201cThis huge shiny expanse of water isn\u2019t far from civilisation in terms of miles and yet, when you enter this ancient place, the bustling modern city is left behind, as if it ceases to exist at all, leaving with it all your stress and worries \u2026\u201d Each story lasts about 15 minutes, enabling listeners to set their sleep timer. The stories draw on the Sleep Council\u2019s research into sounds that help people wind down, such as waves lapping on a shore, soft rainfall and birdsong. Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio, told the Guardian the project was inspired partly by the realisation that increasing numbers of people were listening to audiobooks \u201cas they\u2019re going to sleep or as part of their bedtime routine\u201d. He said both adults and children respond to something comforting and familiar as they are nodding off. These are tales without a beginning, a middle or an end, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s being described to you, rather than a story that\u2019s being told to you \u2026 Nothing happens that jolts you.\u201d There are no authors\u2019 names. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re launching them as simply Penguin, Puffin and Ladybird Sleep Tales, rather than mentioning the writers by name because the focus isn\u2019t just on the words. The combination of the words, the voice and the sound design all contribute to the relaxing atmosphere.\u201d Asked whether a boring story could have the same effect, he said the stories needed to be \u201cengaging enough not to put you off\u201d: \u201cThis is about creating the right environment and headspace for you \u2026 to go to sleep. Strangely, if you\u2019re bored, it doesn\u2019t have that effect.\u201d Audience research had been very positive, Lennon said. One listener reported: \u201cThe story made my mind stop racing.\u201d The phrase \u201csleep like a baby\u201d does not apply to a lot of children, with four in 10 having sleep problems. But Lennon said the children\u2019s sleep tales were not intended to replace a bedtime story, only to become part of a bedtime routine. Lisa Artis of the Sleep Council said not everyone liked the same sounds: \u201cSome people love thunder and lightning or birds tweeting. That\u2019s why we came up with different stories with different effects. For some people, listening to rain just makes them want to go to the loo. But I personally like the sound of rain. I find it quite therapeutic.\u201d She added that listening to \u201cnon-stimulating\u201d stories were about switching off before bedtime: \u201cIt is the sort of thing you need to be doing before bed to feel more relaxed, rather than scrolling through Facebook and checking work emails \u2026 We need to forget about everything that\u2019s going on because we will not get a good night\u2019s sleep otherwise.\u201d",

The \u201crobbery kits\u201d, made up of a T-shirt bearing the city council logo, a pair of shorts, flip-flops and a metro ticket, are particularly appreciated by swimmers on the city\u2019s nudist beaches of Sant Sebasti\u00e0 and Mar Bella whom thieves have left exposed. The kits handed out by officers of the city\u2019s Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana have saved the blushes of 174 bathers since this year\u2019s summer season officially began on 27 May. The number given out has increased each year since they were introduced in 2016. Barcelona has five kilometres of beaches of which the most popular, with both bathers and thieves, is Barceloneta. By the end of last week, 853 thefts had been reported to the local police station, including 17 cases of robbery with violence. A dedicated group of officers, some in plainclothes, have patrolled the city\u2019s 10 beaches from May to September for the past eight years in cars and on foot, bicycles, scooters and quad bikes.

But Prague is ahead of Budapest in appointing an official night mayor, providing information on what to do and not to do and generally being proactive. Budapest could learn a lot from it.\u201d</p> <h2>Over-tourism: how cities fight back</h2> <p><strong>Venice</strong></p> <p>The canal city, already under ever-present threat from natural floods, is considering radical steps to stem the deluge of humanity streaming in every year: a minimum entry fee, starting at \u20ac2.50 and rising to between \u20ac5 and \u20ac10 during peak periods.</p> <p>The measure has been proposed to limit visitor numbers that have risen to 30 million a year, many of them day-trippers who \u2013 according to some city officials \u2013 stop only to take pictures. It is not the first punitive anti-visitor tax that has been floated. Authorities previously threatened to levy fines of up to \u20ac500 on tourists pulling wheeled suitcases over the cobbled streets, the noise of which irritated locals. The penalty was never implemented.</p> <p><strong>Barcelona</strong></p> <p>Anguish over the effects of tourism has reached such a pitch in the Catalan capital that tourists have supplanted immigrants as targets of hostility \u2013 pithily expressed in the slogan \u201cTourists go home, immigrants welcome\u201d, which began to appear on walls in the city in 2017.</p> <p>Protesters have since marched chanting \u201cBarcelona is not for sale\u201d and \u201cWe will not be driven out\u201d, as a familiar pattern of budget flights and the rising availability of Airbnb rentals has brought a welter of short-term visitors to the city, threatening to trigger an exodus of locals from traditional neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Called tourism-phobia by the Spanish media, the sentiment confounds the economic reality that tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30bn, according to 2017 figures.</p> <p><strong>Amsterdam</strong></p> <p>The authorities have become so concerned about the effects of a certain type of tourist who visits the city in order \u201cto party excessively without regard for the consequences\u201d that they have launched a video as part of an \u201cEnjoy and Respect\u201d campaign.</p> <p>The video targets young men aged 18 to 34, from the Netherlands and UK, who, it says, engage in behaviour that creates \u201cannoyance for locals and business owners and makes \u2026 parts of the city less liveable\u201d. With more than 17 million visitors a year \u2013 including day-trippers \u2013 Amsterdam municipal officials have moved to curb other excesses, including the growth of hotels, souvenir shops, ticket sales outlets and cheese shops.</p> <p><strong>Palma de Mallorca</strong></p> <p>Authorities in the capital of Spain\u2019s Balearic islands voted last year to ban almost all short-term holiday rentals in private flats, such as Airbnb, after complaints from locals that the phenomenon had triggered a surge in rents. Residents had also protested that short-term renters were behaving disrespectfully and paying little heed to local norms.</p> <p>Palma is one of several European cities that have been driven to drastic action on holiday rentals. This year, 10 European cities wrote to the European Commission requesting its support for their fight against the \u201cexplosive growth\u201d of short-term letting platforms.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eugen Kukla could not have made his feelings clearer as 120 drunken tourists thronged noisily past his home around midnight, rudely breaking the silence of a normally sedate city-centre residential street. \u201cFuck pub crawls, fuck pub crawls,\u201d he repeated over and over again, while filming the scene on his smart phone. Some of the crowd reacted in amusement, smiling and waving into the camera. But Kukla, 55, a photojournalist, did not see the joke. \u201cIt\u2019s an expression of my personal feelings, a buildup of frustration over a long period of time, years and years and years,\u201d he said. Kukla says his and his family\u2019s lives have been disrupted by the snowballing trade in pub crawls through the centre of Prague and past their fourth-storey flat. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for 10 or 15 years \u2013 but it\u2019s got worse.\u201d Kukla\u2019s act of resistance was witnessed by the Observer, which joined one of the organised crawls along with a senior councillor from Prague 1 municipality, the local authority responsible for the Czech capital\u2019s historic tourist district \u2013 now under strain as never before from a burgeoning influx of foreign visitors. On a night when thousands of Czechs marched through the city marking the anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion on 21 August 1968 that crushed the liberal Prague Spring in communist Czechoslovakia, tourists from locations as varied as Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, Brazil, Belgium and Armenia roamed the streets on a different mission \u2013 to have fun and get drunk. The spectacle was graphic evidence that \u201cover-tourism\u201d, a phenomenon more commonly associated with destinations such as Barcelona, Amsterdam, Venice and Edinburgh, has arrived in Prague \u2013 a city that was all but sealed off to western visitors until 1989 when the velvet revolution swept the former communist regime from power. In the years since, a rising tide of visitors has flooded in, up from 2.62 million in the year 2000, to just under 8 million last year, drawn by Prague\u2019s reputation as home to stunning baroque and gothic architectural gems \u2013 and cheap beer. Numbers this year are forecast to reach just under 9 million. The trend is transforming Prague and risks pushing out long-term inhabitants of the city centre \u2013 historically considered a residential district \u2013 and turning it into a tourist-only zone. That prospect was called \u201chumiliating\u201d by Jan \u0160tern, who took office this year as the city\u2019s first \u201cnightlife mayor\u201d and has negotiated with bar owners trying to persuade them not to cooperate with pub crawls and to enforce policies prohibiting outdoor noise that would make conditions more tolerable for neighbouring residents. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t give up the historic city centre, which is our most valuable legacy, and not let it become a dead zone that\u2019s just a background for nightlife and a cheap type of tourism,\u201d said \u0160tern. Now the authorities \u2013 alarmed at that possibility and the city\u2019s growing reputation as a location of cheap booze and easy fun \u2013 are pledging a harder line with miscreant visitors, some of whom stand accused of disrespecting Prague and its inhabitants. \u201cThere could in the future be more action taken by the police. We want to get that message out,\u201d said one municipal official. \u201cThere will be harder treatment against tourists and more harsh action when they are making noise. There are even voices calling to use riot squads. When there are 150 people on a pub crawl there needs to be a lot of policemen asking for documents. If anyone is drunk they\u2019ll be taken to alcohol stations and things could be really hard for them.\u201d Over-tourism, as defined by three academics last year, is \u201cthe excessive growth of visitors leading to overcrowding in areas where residents suffer the consequences, which have enforced permanent changes to their lifestyles, access to amenities and general wellbeing\u201d. That definition by Joseph Cheer, Claudio Milano and Marina Novelli, writing on the Conversation website, aptly sums up the reality of many European cities that have reaped the rewards \u2013 but also borne the brunt \u2013 of the explosion in cheap flights and Airbnb-style accommodation that recent years have brought. But it is particularly pertinent to Prague, according to Pavel \u010ci\u017einsk\u00fd, mayor of Prague 1, who has vowed to transform the city\u2019s approach by cracking down on pub crawls and limiting alcohol serving times. He is also promoting information drives to encourage tourists to visit more peripheral areas instead of over-visited attractions such as Charles Bridge and the historic ninth-century castle. The centre of Prague \u201cis losing the quality of normal life,\u201d said \u010ci\u017einsk\u00fd, a lifelong city resident who grew up near the Jewish quarter. \u201cThe centre is becoming a goldmine where you earn a lot of money, but it is not a place for living. It is a significant and crucial problem. \u201cToo many people are coming just for a very small number of purposes, and buildings, and those who want to make profits from the presence of the tourists worsen the situation.\u201d The signs of such tourist-driven commercialisation are everywhere, seen in the spread of cheap souvenir shops, massage parlours painted in out-of-place garish colours \u2013 an example of what officials denounce as \u201cvisual smog\u201d \u2013 and the dancers in giant panda suits that proliferate in Old Town Square, exploiting local busking laws. That practice will be illegal from next month. But it is the commercial pub crawls and other alcohol-related \u201ctours\u201d that are altering the city\u2019s previously tranquil character most dramatically and driving an increasing number of long-term residents out, leaving vacant properties to be rented out. Beer bikes, offering tours to up to a dozen people at a time while they drink unlimited quantities of famous Czech brews to a soundtrack of loud music, have gained notoriety as noisy nuisances, blocking traffic and disturbing passersby. A council attempt to outlaw them is currently being contested by a local microbrewery on the grounds that it is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d. Also notorious are walking tours in Mal\u00e1 Strana, near Prague castle, which often culminate in visits to the Lennon Wall, a famous protest site during communist times that has since become a place of free expression for would-be graffiti artists, but is now being defaced with mindless spraying done at the urging of guides. After offering unlimited beer, guides have been known to push clients into posing for outrageous pictures at city landmarks, according to Prague 1 municipality, which joined one such tour. Tourists were pictured clambering on to outsize statues of babies designed by the Czech artist David \u010cern\u00fd in Kampa Park and pouring beer into the mouths of two male figurines in the courtyard of the Franz Kafka museum. The authority scrutinised the tour after complaints that people had urinated on a statue unveiled in 2014 by Sir Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, to honour Czechoslovakian pilots who fought with the RAF in the Battle of Britain. During the tour, some participants were observed writing obscene slogans on the Lennon Wall, owned by the Sovereign Order of Malta, which afterwards filed a criminal complaint. Residents say such activity has made living conditions intolerable. \u201cI remember this square being a quiet area where you would rarely meet anyone, let alone a tourist,\u201d said Karolina Peake, 43, a lawyer who has lived her entire life in a house near the wall. \u201cEver since the wall became part of the tourist and Baedeker circuit, it has become a bit of a nightmare, and in the last five years it has become unbearable. A lot of drunk tourists are coming and acting like they have conquered the place rather than just visiting. They have no respect for the fact that there are people living here \u2013 and it\u2019s making people reconsider whether they want to continue living in a place where their families have been for generations.\u201d Back on the tour that the Observer and the local councillor joined, people on the Prague Pub Crawl were led down Celetn\u00e1 Street, once the route of ancient Bohemian kings, to a nearby establishment that offered an open bar for two hours before the tour was taken to a series of other pubs on a crawl that lasted into the small hours. As the group wound from bar to bar, being greeted at each venue with a free \u201cwelcome drink\u201d of cheap vodka, residents could be seen closing their windows \u2013 despite warm summer temperatures \u2013 against the rising din. The commotion grew louder as the night wore on. At no point did a tour guide ask the group to keep the noise down, despite local laws demanding quiet in residential areas after 10pm. Indeed, there appeared to be little fear of the law. At the corner of Rybn\u00e1 and Benediktsk\u00e1 Streets \u2013 near the heart of Prague\u2019s infamous \u201cparty district\u201d \u2013 a woman vomited copiously, oblivious to a police station just yards away. She eventually required first aid, administered by the councillor. Outside a bar on 28 October Street, near Wenceslas Square, a couple lay smoking flat on their backs, while others on the pub crawl milled raucously around them. Only after the councillor \u2013 who requested anonymity \u2013 called the police did officers arrive to tell the pub crawlers to quieten down. But they left without imposing fines or making arrests. Such scenes are familiar to Peake. \u201cI\u2019ve remonstrated with tourists and some have been apologetic, but the guides have been aggressive and confrontational,\u201d she said. \u201cThey see the residents as a threat to their business. Unfortunately Prague has become a bit of an Eldorado for these type of tour groups.\u201d The sometimes-obscene graffiti defacing the Lennon Wall has spread to neighbouring properties and sometimes even cars. \u201cIt\u2019s pure vandalism,\u201d she added. One particularly ugly piece of vandalism last month prompted city authorities to up the ante, when graffiti was sprayed on the 600-year-old Charles Bridge. Two German tourists were fined and ordered to pay restoration costs. The graffiti was later removed by a Czech man acting alone and without authorisation. One result will be an information campaign of dos and don\u2019ts on Instagram, which could include pictures of some of the most notorious acts of misbehaviour being used in pixelated form to advise visitors of what to avoid. Posters have already been placed on the Prague metro warning visitors about the need to keep quiet in the streets after 10pm and that failure to comply could result in a \u20ac400 fine. City-centre residents are being officially \u201cencouraged\u201d by Prague 1 municipality to report disturbances from Airbnb properties and other short-term rentals to the police, enabling the authority to fine the owners. Meanwhile, pub-crawl and alcohol-based walking-tour companies will come under greater scrutiny for infractions, such as failing to offer customers receipts \u2013 as required by Czech law \u2013 or to check if they are over 18. Bars cooperating with pub crawls will face increased inspection on health and safety matters, like whether they are exceeding capacity, said \u010ci\u017einsk\u00fd, who added: \u201cWe will have to be tougher \u2026 I do not consider the negotiations very successful.\u201d Despite that verdict, Prague is the envy of Budapest, a city of comparable architectural distinction that shares its communist legacy and new-found problems with tourism. \u201cWhat I see from Budapest is that tourism in Prague is managed a lot better,\u201d said Daniel Nemet, a de facto nightlife mayor of the Hungarian capital, working under a private association of about 50 business owners. \u201cWe have many of the same problems, we have two budget flights arriving from London every day. But Prague is ahead of Budapest in appointing an official night mayor, providing information on what to do and not to do and generally being proactive. Budapest could learn a lot from it.\u201d Over-tourism: how cities fight back Venice The canal city, already under ever-present threat from natural floods, is considering radical steps to stem the deluge of humanity streaming in every year: a minimum entry fee, starting at \u20ac2.50 and rising to between \u20ac5 and \u20ac10 during peak periods. The measure has been proposed to limit visitor numbers that have risen to 30 million a year, many of them day-trippers who \u2013 according to some city officials \u2013 stop only to take pictures. It is not the first punitive anti-visitor tax that has been floated. Authorities previously threatened to levy fines of up to \u20ac500 on tourists pulling wheeled suitcases over the cobbled streets, the noise of which irritated locals. The penalty was never implemented. Barcelona Anguish over the effects of tourism has reached such a pitch in the Catalan capital that tourists have supplanted immigrants as targets of hostility \u2013 pithily expressed in the slogan \u201cTourists go home, immigrants welcome\u201d, which began to appear on walls in the city in 2017. Protesters have since marched chanting \u201cBarcelona is not for sale\u201d and \u201cWe will not be driven out\u201d, as a familiar pattern of budget flights and the rising availability of Airbnb rentals has brought a welter of short-term visitors to the city, threatening to trigger an exodus of locals from traditional neighbourhoods. Called tourism-phobia by the Spanish media, the sentiment confounds the economic reality that tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30bn, according to 2017 figures. Amsterdam The authorities have become so concerned about the effects of a certain type of tourist who visits the city in order \u201cto party excessively without regard for the consequences\u201d that they have launched a video as part of an \u201cEnjoy and Respect\u201d campaign. The video targets young men aged 18 to 34, from the Netherlands and UK, who, it says, engage in behaviour that creates \u201cannoyance for locals and business owners and makes \u2026 parts of the city less liveable\u201d. With more than 17 million visitors a year \u2013 including day-trippers \u2013 Amsterdam municipal officials have moved to curb other excesses, including the growth of hotels, souvenir shops, ticket sales outlets and cheese shops. Palma de Mallorca Authorities in the capital of Spain\u2019s Balearic islands voted last year to ban almost all short-term holiday rentals in private flats, such as Airbnb, after complaints from locals that the phenomenon had triggered a surge in rents. Residents had also protested that short-term renters were behaving disrespectfully and paying little heed to local norms. Palma is one of several European cities that have been driven to drastic action on holiday rentals. This year, 10 European cities wrote to the European Commission requesting its support for their fight against the \u201cexplosive growth\u201d of short-term letting platforms.",

Last year\u2019s dispute followed an attempt by employers to transform the USS from a defined benefits scheme \u2013 which fixed pensions to salaries \u2013 to a defined contribution scheme with considerably lower pension payouts for most members. More than 40,000 staff took industrial action during the strikes in February and March last year. Further strikes scheduled for April would have imperilled end of year exams and graduations, but employers backed down and proposed a joint panel of experts to look at the USS\u2019s structure and valuation. But according to Grady, little has changed, with USS managers unmoved and regulatory mechanisms meaning that contributions will have to rise in the absence of further agreement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be paying this at all. If UUK worked harder to implement the joint expert panel that they signed up to then we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Grady. \u201cIt\u2019s also a nice fudge that universities don\u2019t have to discuss the massive overspending on vice-chancellors\u2019 salaries that we have seen in the last decade, which is just the tip of the iceberg if you want to talk about misspending in universities over the last decade.\u201d UCU\u2019s demands are multi-layered, and include a \u201cno detriment\u201d requirement that means that under any changes to the pension scheme its members will not increase their contributions above 8% of salary, as well as reforming the USS\u2019s operation ahead of a new valuation for the scheme required in 2020. But last week the scheme\u2019s joint negotiating committee opted to increase contributions to 9.6%, a rise of \u00a344 a month for the average member, after the casting vote by the committee\u2019s chair, Sir Andrew Cubie. The employers said they made a counter-offer, limiting staff contributions to 9.1% in exchange for the UCU agreeing not to strike for two years. \u201cIt appears that UCU\u2019s \u2018no detriment\u2019 position means no compromise,\u201d UUK said in a statement, after the union refused to accept the offer. Adam Tickell, the vice-chancellor of Sussex and chair of the employers\u2019 pensions forum, argues that requiring universities to pay substantially increased contributions would have damaging consequences for the sector. \u201cImportantly, increased contributions of this scale are simply unaffordable for many institutions, and the inevitable result would be redundancies, increased workloads, and reduced investment in our facilities,\u201d Tickell recently warned. Grady said the union would not give up its right to take action ahead of the crucial 2020 valuation, which could cause a repeat of last year\u2019s strike if not resolved. \u201cThis was a bully clause, plain and simple. Employers wanted to silence dissent from staff for more than two years. Their thinking is clear: they know contributions are scheduled to go up even more at the 2020 valuation and they will try to cut benefits as a result. They don\u2019t want staff to be able to protest that,\u201d Grady said.",

      "bodyText": "Tanja Lister is addressing her fears of a looming recession one dinner plate at a time. \u201cWe spent about \u00a33,000 on new crockery,\u201d she explains. She has been running the Kylesku hotel, a former coaching inn perched on a wild peninsula in Sutherland, north-west Scotland, with her partner, Sonia Virechauveix, for a decade. \u201cOther people might have made a different decision, but for us it was important that we weren\u2019t sending out a bowl with a chip in it so that people really enjoy their experience.\u201d In addition to the colourful crockery, diners can enjoy panoramic views across Loch Glendhu and an ultra-local menu that this week includes hogget from Drumbeg and Ullapool crab. Boosted by a recent refurbishment and extension, as well as the hotel\u2019s proximity to the phenomenally popular North Coast 500 road route, Lister has been reaping the rewards of Scotland\u2019s high-end and sustainability-conscious tourist boom. Last autumn, however, she noticed a change in customer behaviour that demanded a swift change of strategy. \u201cWe usually have very high occupancy rates, but last October we noticed we were not re-filling cancellations. In November we really started to notice it. In previous years, we\u2019d been seeing increases in the shoulder months [as opposed to the high tourist season] like February and November. But now we saw a drop in occupancy for the first time in 10 years.\u201d Talking to other hospitality businesses along the north-west coast revealed similar experiences, says Lister, with bookings falling by up to 50%. Her decision was to invest heavily \u2013 in the building, the roof, drainage, crockery \u2013 for a very specific reason: \u201cWe decided to spend more rather than less to make sure that when people came out to eat, everything was as it should be. What happens when people feel a pinch is they get a bit more choosy about where they spend their money. \u201cIf they\u2019re only going out once a month then they want to make sure that one place is going to be the best experience they can possibly get for what they want to spend.\u201d As a consequence, says Lister, her customers\u2019 average spend has gone up slightly. Whether such strategies can be effective in the year ahead will be crucial in this corner of the Highlands \u2013 and across the rest of the country. Figures this month showing the first fall in quarterly GDP in six and a half years sparked immediate speculation that the UK was heading for another recession. Scotland\u2019s own figures for the second quarter of 2019 are not released by the Scottish government until next month, but Mairi Spowage, the deputy director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, an independent economic research unit based at Strathclyde University, says she believes the results will mirror the UK-wide picture.

I would expect a similar contraction in construction and manufacturing that you saw in the UK, along with limited services growth, which could lead to a negative figure for Scotland as well\u201d.

Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, says: \u201cBusiness confidence in Scotland has been bumping along the bottom for some time now, except for an increase in the spring which could have been down to Brexit stockpiling or related preparatory work. \u201cSome of our members \u2013 especially those in hospitality \u2013 highlight the impact of compound increases in overheads combined with waning consumer demand.\u201d But, he adds, nothing is settled yet. \u201cIt is absolutely too early to say whether a recession is certain, and we\u2019d argue that there\u2019s action politicians could take to restore business and consumer confidence.\u201d The evidence suggests they will need to.

Here we examine seven clues that the trend, after 10 years of expansion, could be backwards.</p> <h2><strong>Escalation in US</strong><strong>-China tariff war</strong></h2> <p>Eighteen months ago Donald Trump began his \u201cAmerica first\u201d campaign with a fight over steel dumping. The US president imposed 25% import tariffs on steel against China, the EU, India, Canada and Mexico.</p> <p>Since then the focus has all been on China. Trump blamed Beijing for undercutting US goods with an undervalued currency. As a punishment he imposed import tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods and has threatened to expand the scope to include computer games consoles, mobile phones and laptops. It\u2019s difficult to measure the impact, but most countries report a downturn in trade since the tariffs began to bite.</p> <h2><strong>Slowing US growth</strong></h2> <p>Trump inherited a buoyant economy and then gave it a sugar rush of income tax cuts and corporate giveaways. Stellar growth last year prompted the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to increase interest rates to calm things down.</p> <p>A combination of those higher borrowing costs, the end of the sugar rush and the tariff war with China, which has increased import costs, has hit US industrial production. Figures last week showed the US manufacturing sector in decline for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>Trump, fearing the economic slowdown will damage his re-election hopes, has berated the Fed for being slow to cut rates again. Last week US Steel, which the president believed would prosper once it was protected from cheap Asian and European imports, said business was so bad it would be laying off workers and its stock value slumped back to where it was before Trump\u2019s election victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/us_gdp/giv-3902drmfCA3yTUIb/\" data-alt=\"US growth chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/us_gdp/giv-3902drmfCA3yTUIb/\">US growth chart</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Long recession in Germany</strong></h2> <p>Angela Merkel\u2019s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has raised expectations of a \u20ac50bn (\u00a345bn) boost to the German economy to head off an imminent recession. The economy contracted by a small margin in the second quarter \u2013 0.1% \u2013 but is expect to suffer a second and larger drop in the third quarter.</p> <p>Most analysts expect Scholz\u2019s extra cash will be too little too late to prevent two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which is the technical definition of a recession. A turnaround next year largely depends on a recovery in China, where Germany now sells much of its machine tools, industrial equipment and cars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/german_gdp/giv-3902sxdql8FzjHJH/\" data-alt=\"German GDP chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/german_gdp/giv-3902sxdql8FzjHJH/\">German GDP chart</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chinese debt crisis</strong></h2> <p>China, more than the US, has been the extra gear for the global economy since the 2008 financial crash, but the country is in the throes of a full-blown debt crisis.</p> <p>State industries have borrowed heavily and so have consumers. Banks are weighed down by loans that will never be repaid. Each time Beijing has attempted to rein in excessive consumer and corporate lending, the global economy has wobbled, forcing China\u2019s policymakers to loosen credit again.</p> <p>Meanwhile, industrial production growth is at a 30-year low at 4.8%. Beijing wants the economy to become more self-contained with a shift from manufacturing to services, but it\u2019s a long haul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-23T14:07:38/embed.html\" data-alt=\"China industrial production chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-23T14:07:38/embed.html\">China industrial production chart</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2> <p>The uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s future and whether it remains inside the world\u2019s largest trading bloc or swims alone has already damaged investment and GDP growth.</p> <p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, most economists believe the damage will be severe. The IMF, OECD and World Bank have also warned that leaving without a deal will knock global growth, given the UK is the world\u2019s sixth largest economy after France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/uk_gdp/giv-3902IsmbFnNholOs/\" data-alt=\"UK GDP chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/uk_gdp/giv-3902IsmbFnNholOs/\">UK GDP chart</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Argentina, Iran, South Africa, Turkey and Venezuela</strong></h2> <p>A string of countries are currently in recession or have recently suffered a contraction. Iran faces a blockade by the US and is unable to sell its oil or access the financial markets easily. Argentina is weighed down by enormous debts and Venezuela, despite holding the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, is in political and economic crisis.</p> <p>International investors don\u2019t worry much about these countries, which have over the years been financially ring-fenced, but South Africa and Turkey pose a greater problem. They are more integrated into regional and international markets, which means a debt default would have a far greater impact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-23T13:51:08/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Turkey economy chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-23T13:51:08/embed.html\">Turkey economy chart</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Financial market jitters</strong></h2> <p>Signs from the international money markets are mixed. Stock markets in the US and Germany remain at historically high levels, but bond markets are more jittery.</p> <p>Investors who lend money to the US government via the bond market have sold their short-term loans in droves in expectation of an imminent recession, much as they did before the 2008 financial crash. The bond market never lies, especially about the path of the US economy, say many analysts, fuelling even more speculation that US economy could be in dire trouble as early as next year.</p> <p>The saviour could be the Fed, which might cut interest rates back toward zero, allowing indebted companies and households to breathe a sigh of relief. That said, it will only kick a final reckoning down the road, to the moment when bad debts reach levels that neither banks nor government can cope with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-23T13:55:08/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Dow Jones chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-23T13:55:08/embed.html\">Dow Jones chart</a> </figure>",

Trump blamed Beijing for undercutting US goods with an undervalued currency. As a punishment he imposed import tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods and has threatened to expand the scope to include computer games consoles, mobile phones and laptops. It\u2019s difficult to measure the impact, but most countries report a downturn in trade since the tariffs began to bite. Slowing US growth Trump inherited a buoyant economy and then gave it a sugar rush of income tax cuts and corporate giveaways. Stellar growth last year prompted the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to increase interest rates to calm things down. A combination of those higher borrowing costs, the end of the sugar rush and the tariff war with China, which has increased import costs, has hit US industrial production. Figures last week showed the US manufacturing sector in decline for the first time in a decade. Trump, fearing the economic slowdown will damage his re-election hopes, has berated the Fed for being slow to cut rates again. Last week US Steel, which the president believed would prosper once it was protected from cheap Asian and European imports, said business was so bad it would be laying off workers and its stock value slumped back to where it was before Trump\u2019s election victory. Long recession in Germany Angela Merkel\u2019s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has raised expectations of a \u20ac50bn (\u00a345bn) boost to the German economy to head off an imminent recession. The economy contracted by a small margin in the second quarter \u2013 0.1% \u2013 but is expect to suffer a second and larger drop in the third quarter. Most analysts expect Scholz\u2019s extra cash will be too little too late to prevent two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which is the technical definition of a recession. A turnaround next year largely depends on a recovery in China, where Germany now sells much of its machine tools, industrial equipment and cars. Chinese debt crisis China, more than the US, has been the extra gear for the global economy since the 2008 financial crash, but the country is in the throes of a full-blown debt crisis. State industries have borrowed heavily and so have consumers. Banks are weighed down by loans that will never be repaid. Each time Beijing has attempted to rein in excessive consumer and corporate lending, the global economy has wobbled, forcing China\u2019s policymakers to loosen credit again. Meanwhile, industrial production growth is at a 30-year low at 4.8%. Beijing wants the economy to become more self-contained with a shift from manufacturing to services, but it\u2019s a long haul. Brexit The uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s future and whether it remains inside the world\u2019s largest trading bloc or swims alone has already damaged investment and GDP growth. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, most economists believe the damage will be severe. The IMF, OECD and World Bank have also warned that leaving without a deal will knock global growth, given the UK is the world\u2019s sixth largest economy after France. Argentina, Iran, South Africa, Turkey and Venezuela A string of countries are currently in recession or have recently suffered a contraction. Iran faces a blockade by the US and is unable to sell its oil or access the financial markets easily. Argentina is weighed down by enormous debts and Venezuela, despite holding the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, is in political and economic crisis. International investors don\u2019t worry much about these countries, which have over the years been financially ring-fenced, but South Africa and Turkey pose a greater problem. They are more integrated into regional and international markets, which means a debt default would have a far greater impact. Financial market jitters Signs from the international money markets are mixed. Stock markets in the US and Germany remain at historically high levels, but bond markets are more jittery. Investors who lend money to the US government via the bond market have sold their short-term loans in droves in expectation of an imminent recession, much as they did before the 2008 financial crash. The bond market never lies, especially about the path of the US economy, say many analysts, fuelling even more speculation that US economy could be in dire trouble as early as next year. The saviour could be the Fed, which might cut interest rates back toward zero, allowing indebted companies and households to breathe a sigh of relief. That said, it will only kick a final reckoning down the road, to the moment when bad debts reach levels that neither banks nor government can cope with.",

Summits are usually attended by leaders, finance ministers and central bank governors. As well as the seven nations, the meetings are also usually attended by leaders from the European Union, and representatives from international financial institutions including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAccordingly, I am writing on behalf of all former ministers in the last administration to ask you to withdraw these allegations which question our integrity, acknowledge that no former minister could have leaked this document, and apologise for the misleading briefing from No 10,\u201d Hammond said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PhilipHammondUK/status/1165539601680916480\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It has now become apparent that the Operation Yellowhammer document leaked last week was dated August 2019, and was not \u2018old\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has written to Boris Johnson to demand an apology from the prime minster for suggestions that he or other ministers in the previous government could have been behind the leaking of a dossier detailing Britain\u2019s plans for a no-deal Brexit. Blaming former ministers cast questions on their integrity, said the former chancellor, in a letter to Johnson of which he also tweeted a copy on Sunday morning as the prime minister was engaged in the G7 meeting in Biarritz. Hammond referred to media reports that quoted Downing Street sources as briefing that the details of Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 the codename for the cross-government civil contingency planning for the possibility of no-deal Brexit \u2013 had been deliberately leaked in an attempt to influence discussions with other EU leaders. The clear implication was that a minister in the previous government had retained and then leaked, a copy of this document, added Hammond. He said it had become apparent that the leaked document was, in fact, dated August 2019 and could not, therefore, have been available to any former minister not serving in the current administration. \u201cAccordingly, I am writing on behalf of all former ministers in the last administration to ask you to withdraw these allegations which question our integrity, acknowledge that no former minister could have leaked this document, and apologise for the misleading briefing from No 10,\u201d Hammond said. Leaked details of Operation Yellowhammer predicted that the UK would face a three-month meltdown at its ports, a hard Irish border and shortages of food and medicine if it left the EU without a deal. The documents predict severe extended delays to medicine supplies and shortages of some fresh foods combined with price rises as a likely scenario if the UK leaves without a withdrawal agreement, which is due to happen on 31 October. The letter marks an escalation in the war of words between No 10 and Hammond, who is leading a group of 20 Conservatives making clear their opposition to crashing out on 31 October, over the Yellowhammer dossier. Despite the document, leaked to the Sunday Times, being dated to earlier this month when Johnson was already in post, a senior No 10 source had told reporters last weekend: \u201cThis document is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available.\u201d \u201cIt has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As someone who has spent a lifetime fixated on horticulture (as a kid I used to stay up late reading the <em>RHS Encyclopaedia</em> under my covers with a torch), I thought I had a pretty good grip on how to grow plants. But there is always a surprise in store.</p> <p>Two years ago, I wandered into an exotic pet exhibition while on holiday in the Netherlands. I was blown away by the spectacular horticultural installations being made by collectors of poison dart frogs, praying mantises and colourful land crabs. I couldn\u2019t fathom how they managed to create thriving colonies of velvety moss or immaculate living walls dripping in orchids. And, quite frankly, I felt frustrated that I only recognised about half the plants.</p> <p>I learned that, unbeknown to mainstream horticulturists, there is a parallel universe of plant-growing expertise being amassed by lovers of exotic animals. Many of them have little or no formal horticultural or botanical training and yet they have come up with all sorts of ingenious ideas (see <a href=\"http://www.dartfrog.co.uk/\" title=\"\">dartfrog.co.uk</a>). These supergeeks not only have their own commercial nurseries for weird and wonderful plant species, but also radically different growing media, planting techniques and even gardening tools. Inspired by them, here are some of the things I\u2019ve learned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e53dff4d8b15e4d4ddf68e88f8bc6efeb9de34d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e53dff4d8b15e4d4ddf68e88f8bc6efeb9de34d4/0_251_3824_2294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feeling the pinch: vampire crabs and red devil crabs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling the pinch: vampire crabs and red devil crabs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitri Maruta/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is no secret to regular readers that I love terrariums, particularly the ones that house \u201cEndor\u201d landscapes of miniature mossy woodlands. But as many native UK moss species tend to grow into lanky threads of brown mess in the dark and warmth of terrariums, using the stuff from the bottom of your garden is unlikely to work. Fortunately, this conundrum has been cracked by exotic pet suppliers, who sell at least half a dozen tropical moss species, plus a few temperate ones, that will stay as neat, ground-hugging mats even indoors. </p> <p>I also became fascinated by the use of solid growing media, such as tree fern trunks, to create living walls, posts and pillars, even sculptures. Plants can be attached to these fibrous substrates by simply tucking their roots into cracks and crevices or by tying or even gluing them in place. If kept consistently moist, they will root and quickly clothe the 3D landscape in green. Many suppliers sell the stuff in every shape and size, but I recommend Moss on Treefern (<a href=\"https://frogsandmore.nl/moss/\" title=\"\">frogsandmore.nl/moss/</a>). It has a transparent supply chain and sustainability certification.</p> <p>The best discovery, however, were the plants themselves. Fancy a range of tiny orchids where the whole plant would fit on your fingertip? Maybe an iridescent spikemoss that shimmers like a butterfly\u2019s wing?

      "bodyText": "As someone who has spent a lifetime fixated on horticulture (as a kid I used to stay up late reading the RHS Encyclopaedia under my covers with a torch), I thought I had a pretty good grip on how to grow plants. But there is always a surprise in store. Two years ago, I wandered into an exotic pet exhibition while on holiday in the Netherlands. I was blown away by the spectacular horticultural installations being made by collectors of poison dart frogs, praying mantises and colourful land crabs. I couldn\u2019t fathom how they managed to create thriving colonies of velvety moss or immaculate living walls dripping in orchids. And, quite frankly, I felt frustrated that I only recognised about half the plants. I learned that, unbeknown to mainstream horticulturists, there is a parallel universe of plant-growing expertise being amassed by lovers of exotic animals. Many of them have little or no formal horticultural or botanical training and yet they have come up with all sorts of ingenious ideas (see dartfrog.co.uk). These supergeeks not only have their own commercial nurseries for weird and wonderful plant species, but also radically different growing media, planting techniques and even gardening tools. Inspired by them, here are some of the things I\u2019ve learned. It is no secret to regular readers that I love terrariums, particularly the ones that house \u201cEndor\u201d landscapes of miniature mossy woodlands. But as many native UK moss species tend to grow into lanky threads of brown mess in the dark and warmth of terrariums, using the stuff from the bottom of your garden is unlikely to work. Fortunately, this conundrum has been cracked by exotic pet suppliers, who sell at least half a dozen tropical moss species, plus a few temperate ones, that will stay as neat, ground-hugging mats even indoors. I also became fascinated by the use of solid growing media, such as tree fern trunks, to create living walls, posts and pillars, even sculptures. Plants can be attached to these fibrous substrates by simply tucking their roots into cracks and crevices or by tying or even gluing them in place. If kept consistently moist, they will root and quickly clothe the 3D landscape in green. Many suppliers sell the stuff in every shape and size, but I recommend Moss on Treefern (frogsandmore.nl/moss/). It has a transparent supply chain and sustainability certification. The best discovery, however, were the plants themselves. Fancy a range of tiny orchids where the whole plant would fit on your fingertip? Maybe an iridescent spikemoss that shimmers like a butterfly\u2019s wing? How about bromeliads in Avatar colours, sizes and shapes that you\u2019ve never seen before? The only place to find this treasure trove of great vivarium plants is not from garden centres, but from shops selling supplies for animals (try dutchrana.nl). Discovering the work of these plant geeks was a revelation \u2013 like making first contact with a long, lost civilisation with new ideas and technology.

It\u2019s demanding. As I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s never nearly enough simply to be too busy to talk with people. Other people must know you\u2019re too busy. So you have to tell everyone repeatedly. That\u2019s what you call a message track. Soon enough, word will get around that you\u2019re too busy to talk with anyone and your reputation as a person of importance will go through the roof. As a result, more people will try to get in touch with you. Years ago, I was less busy than I am now, but it left me with too much time to think about what I was doing with my life. Now I\u2019m too busy to think about what I\u2019m doing with my life. I just go from errand to errand until I collapse in bed every night realizing that being too busy to think about what I\u2019m doing my life gives it true meaning. Yes, being this overcommitted takes a toll. I often have to leave crossword puzzles unfinished. Last week I had to give away a Deepak Chopra DVD because I was too busy to watch it, much less follow his advice. My therapist tells me that my pathological busyness is symptomatic of underlying issues I need to address \u2013 avoidant behavior, she called it \u2013 and I politely asked her to mind her own business, then threatened to fire her. Just the other day, our head of HR staged an intervention warning me I\u2019m now officially too busy doing my job to actually do my job. So I\u2019m trying to make amends. I took a time management course, counting the minutes until it would be over. But I also experimented with meditation. And guess what? It worked! Now I carve out at least 15 minutes every day to clear my head enough to obsess over all the chores I could be doing in those 15 minutes. Bliss!

      "bodyText": "Jo Swinson was being \u201cextremely petulant\u201d when she dismissed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s call to make him prime minister to block a no-deal Brexit, according to the Labour frontbencher Barry Gardiner. In comments likely to ratchet up tensions between the two parties before a meeting Corbyn has called of parliamentary opponents of no deal, Gardiner accused the Liberal Democrat leader of wanting to propel the Queen into a constitutional crisis. Swinson rejected Corbyn\u2019s offer earlier this month when he outlined plans to oust the government through a vote of no confidence and form a \u201cstrictly time-limited\u201d caretaker government to prevent a no-deal Brexit. But Gardiner, the shadow trade secretary, told Sky News on Sunday: \u201cI think it was extremely petulant of Jo Swinson to come out and dismiss this the other day. \u201cIt sounded as if she couldn\u2019t take yes for an answer because she has been saying, and the Liberal Democrats and others have been saying for so long: \u2018Look, we need to have a second referendum and remain needs to be on the ballot paper.\u2019 \u201cThey are now being offered a failsafe parliamentary procedural way of delivering that and they\u2019re saying: \u2018Oh well, we are not going to cooperate if Jeremy Corbyn is going to be the person who does it.\u2019\u201d Gardiner added that the \u201cnatural constitutional process\u201d was that the leader of the opposition was called on by the Queen to lead a new government when an old one failed. \u201cIf Jo Swinson wants to propel Her Majesty into a constitutional crisis where, instead of inviting the leader of the opposition to form a new government, she invites somebody else who is not the leader of a political party, then that would be forcing the monarchy into a very embarrassing and difficult judgment call that they would have to make.\u201d After initially rebuffing Corbyn, Swinson said she would work with the Labour party to prevent a no-deal Brexit amid pressure from other opposition leaders, but underlined her belief that a Corbyn-led unity government would not win the confidence of parliament. The Conservative and Labour grandees Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman \u2013 who are the father and mother of the house, or longest-serving male and female MPs \u2013 are prepared to lead the emergency government, Swinson added, saying she had won both of their assurances. Gardiner\u2019s comments drew a response from Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson, who said that Swinson \u201chas very reasonably pointed out\u201d that Jeremy Corbyn needs at least eight Tory rebels to support his prospective premiership for his caretaker government to work. \u201cThis is not going to happen,\u201d he added on Twitter. Umunna said of Gardiner\u2019s comments: \u201cBy all means disagree but this is patronising tribal bluster.

This edition of Sunday sportwatch begins with plenty unknown but will end with the finals program established in both Super Netball and the AFL, before we segue seamlessly into what could turn into the most exciting night of Test cricket in a generation. </p> <p>Here\u2019s the menu:</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> - Super Netball: Magpies v Vixens. The final match of the home and away season is a Melbourne derby pitting fifth against third. The Magpies need every point on offer to crack the top four. The Vixens will travel to the Swifts in the first week of the finals whatever the result. </p> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> - AFL: Bulldogs v Adelaide. A Bulldogs win will see them leap from ninth to seventh; defeat and their season is over. Thanks to Hawthorn\u2019s upset over in Perth the Crows now have to win by a cricket score to remain any hope of pipping the Hawks into eighth. </p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> - NRL: Storm v Titans. The best side this home and away season against the worst results in a fixture containing the least jeopardy of the afternoon. That could all change if Melbourne somehow contrive to lose to Gold Coast, but even with two defeats in their previous four outings that would still represent the shock of the campaign. </p> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong> - AFL: Richmond v Brisbane. Another AFL barnburner. It\u2019s fourth v second as things stand, but a Lions victory would hand them the most unlikely of minor premierships and in turn bump the Tigers down to fifth. A Richmond win would guarantee third place on the ladder while a victory margin of at least 63 points would see them replace Brisbane in second. </p> <p><strong>4.05pm</strong> - NRL: Raiders v Sea Eagles. The focus of NRL attention pits third against fifth. Victory for Canberra would all-but guarantee them third spot heading into the finals but defeat would drag them into a dogfight alongside two other sides on 14 wins. A win for Manly would elevate them into that 30-point logjam while defeat keeps them only points difference ahead of the sixth placed Eels.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm -</strong> AFL: Port Adelaide v Fremantle. Depending on the outcome of the Bulldogs v Adelaide contest this fixture could be a dead rubber. However, if the Crows get up then the Power are slim chance of sneaking into the top eight. To do so they would need at least a 95 point victory.</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong> - Cricket: Day four of the third Ashes Test. This will be on our minds all afternoon I\u2019m sure but from 8pm (liveblog kicking off at 7pm) we could be in for a slice of history if England can make a fist of chasing down the 203 runs required for an improbable series saving victory.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be around for the next few hours, after which Richard Gadsby will steer us towards Headingley.

      "bodyText": "Final thoughts Or maybe that should be finals thoughts. A weekend of sliding up and down ladders leaves the Bulldogs in the top eight, the Tigers in the top four, and the Crows with a handful of splinters. It\u2019s shaping up to be a thrilling September. I\u2019d also like to put my Super Netball hat on, purely so I can tip it in the direction of the Magpies, who beat the odds to sneak into fourth spot. And a final nod to the Sea Eagles for a battling victory over the Raiders. There\u2019s still some ladder shuffling to come in the NRL, but Des Hasler will have his eyes locked on cementing that top-four spot - tough run-in or not. Well played one and all. Thanks for joining me everyone, catch you next time. And the final siren sounds on the home-and-away season. A strong finish to a disappointing campaign for Port. They were helped along by a listless Dockers, who left their desire in the sheds at half-time. AAP: Port Adelaide completed their season with a 43-point trouncing of a lacklustre Fremantle in Sunday\u2019s twilight clash of the AFL also-rans. Port triumphed 15.20 (110) to 10.7 (67) at Adelaide Oval and finish 10th on the ladder. The Dockers, in what looms as star winger Brad Hill\u2019s last game for the club as he eyes a return to Melbourne, were over-run after quarter-time and end the season in 13th spot. Port\u2019s chances of sneaking into the top eight were extinguished by the Western Bulldogs\u2019 win earlier on Sunday. But the Power convincingly downed Fremantle, under caretaker coach David Hale. Cricket: The good news is there\u2019s guaranteed excitement just around the corner as Australia head into the fourth day at Headingley chasing seven more wickets to retain the Ashes. You can follow all the action with Jonathan Howcroft on our blog below... AFL: Q4: Seven minutes remaining: Port Adelaide 13.19 (97) v Fremantle 7.7 (49) Into the final few minutes and there couldn\u2019t be less at stake (I\u2019ve never been one for hyperbole). The result isn\u2019t in doubt and the ladder is all sorted. Nineteen-year-old Connor Rozee kicks another goal to the delight of the Port fans. He looks pretty thrilled himself. AFL: Not to kick a man while he\u2019s down but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who wants to know what Adelaide coach Don Pyke had to say after that meek end to the Crows\u2019 campaign. The odds were against them but I thought they\u2019d at least make a game of it. We just got into a bit of a funk to be honest. We got to the bye in reasonable shape, sitting at 8-5 with a lot to play for, then never really got going in the second half of the season. So we need to go away, lick our wounds and have a real look at what\u2019s transpired, what we need to change and fix. We\u2019ve got some great people at the footy club ... but we\u2019ve clearly underperformed against our own expectations. We now need to own that and work out exactly what we need to do to get ourselves back to playing the way that we\u2019re capable of. Don Pyke AFL: Q3: Port Adelaide 11.17 (83) v Fremantle 6.6 (42) One more quarter of the home-and-away season to go, although this is pretty much over already. Port are 41 points to the good against a distracted Dockers. They knew going into today that they\u2019d need a big score to qualify for the finals. Results conspired against them, but they\u2019re on track for a big margin anyway. Apologies to Robbie Gray for posting the clip below. Couldn\u2019t resist. AFL: Not exactly my idea of a lullaby but it seems to have done the trick. AFL: Q3: Four minutes remaining: Port Adelaide 10.14 (74) v Fremantle 5.6 (36) Well it\u2019s been one-way traffic pretty much since the end of the first quarter. Certainly since the start of this quarter. If the Power are disappointed at missing out on the finals, it\u2019s certainly not showing in their play. They\u2019re keen to finish on an upbeat note. The Dockers look like their minds are already on the plane back to Fremantle. NRL: The players\u2019 union has taken aim at the NRL over its attempt to introduce a \u201cpunishment matrix\u201d, accusing the governing body of freezing it out of discussions. Rugby League Players\u2019 Association CEO Ian Prendergast was angered after details of a proposed schedule of penalties for poor off-field behaviour were leaked to the media. On Sunday, he contacted NRL chief Todd Greenberg and ARL Commission chairman Peter Beattie to express his frustrations. The NRL has revealed to clubs a draft plan for a stringent penalty regime in an attempt to introduce consistency. While the RLPA is not necessarily opposed to the idea of codifying punishments, it says there are several \u201cred flags\u201d in some of the leaked potential sanctions. However it is most disappointed at not being invited to the table to discuss the proposition. AAP AFL: Q3: 17 mins remaining: Port Adelaide 8.11 (59) v Fremantle 5.6 (36) Now back to Adelaide, and a chance for the rest of the AFL to take a breather, sit back and watch a dead rubber after an intense few days of jostling for ladder positions. Not a bad game either, and a lovely setting sun over Adelaide Oval. How fitting. Port Adelaide are finishing the season with a flourish. A Dixon goal (his second) takes their lead up to 23 points. And the Sea Eagles hold on in Canberra... even without Morgan Boyle, who was sin-binned for the final couple of minutes. A big, big win for Des Hasler\u2019s side. AAP: Manly made the most of an eight-point try to keep their spot in the NRL\u2019s top four with a crucial 18-14 win over Canberra. In a heavyweight battle, punctuated by 26 penalties, Manly held on desperately for the final eight minutes to keep out the fast-finishing Raiders. Down to 15 men for the majority of the match with Joel Thompson (suspected broken arm) and Moses Suli (ankle) injured, Manly had Morgan Boyle sin-binned in the last minute. But they made a number of last-ditch tackles on their line in the game\u2019s final minutes. It\u2019s all over. The result was in the bag for a while but we were just waiting on confirmation of finals positions. Richmond make the top four (third) just behind the Lions. Well played to the Tigers, the Lions were in it almost all the way though. AAP: Richmond are one step closer to the AFL premiership after locking away a top-four finish with a 27-point win over Brisbane at the MCG. Sunday\u2019s 12.10 (82) to 8.7 (55) victory means the Tigers will finish third on the ladder and face the second-placed Lions at the Gabba in a mouth-watering qualifying-final rematch. Minor premiers Geelong will host Collingwood at the MCG in the other qualifying final. Richmond dominated early on Sunday afternoon to lead by 26 points at halftime, but were made to fight tooth and nail in an electric third quarter during which the Lions pared back the margin to seven points. But as they\u2019ve so often been able to do, the Tigers found another gear and wrestled the game back onto their terms to prevail in front of 76,995 fans. NRL: 76 mins: Raiders 14-18 Sea Eagles Another Croker try means we\u2019re in for a grandstand finish in Canberra. The Raiders have their tails up as the clock ticks down. The Sea Eagles defending valiantly... so far. AFL: HT: Port Adelaide 7.9 (51) v Fremantle 5.6 (36) The pendulum swings all the way back to Port with a strong finish before the main break. They were nine down after the first quarter but now have a 15-point margin. NRL: 70 mins: Raiders 10-18 Sea Eagles The Green Machine is just starting to stall. Fair play to the Sea Eagles who have taken full advantage on a long slog of a day. They get another try - this time from Jake Trbojevic - and another Garrick kick gives them a crucial eight-point lead as we head into the final 10 minutes. Can the Raiders respond? AFL: Q4: 8 mins remaining: Richmond 12.7 (79) v Brisbane 7.6 (48) It\u2019s been a low-scoring quarter so far, which won\u2019t worry Richmond too much... depending on how you view the ladder. The Lions still haven\u2019t added to their tally since the break. NRL: 62 mins: Raiders 10-12 Sea Eagles Tommy Trbojevic tries to put pressure on the ball over the try line through a crowd of Raiders players - and fails. Just. No try is the call, quite correctly. Kind of sums up the game: hardly a classic and very little in it. AFL: Q4: 15 minutes remaining: Richmond 11.7 (73) v Brisbane 7.6 (48) Dusty collects and kicks to give the Tigers a bit more breathing room at the start of the final quarter. The Lions need to respond quickly to keep themselves in this. NRL: 54 mins: Raiders 10-12 Sea Eagles A little bit of controversy as Manly take the lead for the first time courtesy of an eight-point try. Garrick with the try after an intercept nine metres out from the Manly line. Still plenty to go but I suspect this is going right down to the wire. You certainly can\u2019t write off the Raiders. Just ask the Storm. AFL: Q3: Richmond 10.7 (67) v Brisbane 7.6 (48) It\u2019s three-quarter-time and the Tigers have weathered that early storm and fought back to give themselves a useful margin as we head into the final quarter. We could be in for a bit of a thriller to (almost) end the regular season. AFL: The AFL has broken its attendance record for the third-straight year. Sunday\u2019s crowd at the MCG for the Richmond-Brisbane game took the season total to 6,894,771, with the Sunday twilight game at Adelaide Oval between Port Adelaide and Fremantle to come. It tops last year\u2019s regular season total of 6,894,770, while the 2017 figure was 6,732,601. AAP AFL: Q1: Port Adelaide 3.4 (22) v Fremantle 5.1 (31) Fremantle have fought back well after an early surge from Port Adelaide. Still tight though. It\u2019s actually a pretty good game. Funny how often that happens when the pressure is off. NFL: Another disappointing day for Valentine Holmes as he chases his NFL dream. He didn\u2019t get much game time for the New York Jets in their 28-13 pre-season loss to the New Orleans Saints. He was given punt-and-kick-return duties but struggled to put his hand up for a place on the 53-man roster. Despite that, he\u2019s not heading back to the NRL just yet. I miss it a bit (rugby league), but I\u2019m still excited and glad I made the decision to come here. It\u2019s pretty cool to be able to share a locker with these guys. Some of these guys I used to watch a few years back. A lot of the (Cronulla) boys watch it and we all kind of aspire not be like these guys, but they\u2019re cool athletes and very talented and to be able to train alongside them and play whenever I can, it\u2019s special. So I guess that drives me in itself and just being over here on one of the biggest stages. Valentine Holmes AFL: Q3: 11 minutes remaining: Richmond 8.6 (54) v Brisbane 7.5 (47) The Lions are clawing (no pun intended) their way back into this, and the Richmond fans can sense it. They\u2019re not happy. Plenty of booing today - but Brisbane have the blinkers on. The Lions have come roaring out (no pun intended) in this third quarter. NRL: HT: Raiders 8-4 Sea Eagles Two very late penalties for Manly, including one on the siren, keep them breathing down the necks of the Raiders - who had stretched the lead to eight at one stage. It\u2019s been pretty scrappy so far, a few too many penalties by either side, but Canberra will probably feel they should be a further ahead. AFL: Q1: 17 mins remaining: Port Adelaide 1.0 (6) v Fremantle 0.0 (0) When play began today, it was always the longest of long shots for the Power to finish in the eight - and so it\u2019s proved. It\u2019s all a matter of pride for Freo and Port now. Marshall opens the scoring with a straightforward one. First blood to Power. AFL: HT: Richmond 8.6 (54) v Brisbane 4.4 (28) We\u2019re at the main break and it\u2019s the Tigers very much in control. After the season they\u2019ve had, you can never rule out the Lions, but Richmond look well up for this one - and so are their fans. Jack Riewoldt doing the damage with four goals. NRL: 21 mins: Raiders 6-0 Sea Eagles Ha, the Raiders go over as soon as I press launch on the previous post. Croker with the try. It was coming. He kicks the extras too. NRL: 20mins: Raiders 0-0 Sea Eagles Chances at either end. A no-try call against the Raiders. It\u2019s a big one too. Arguable from both perspectives. DCE getting underneath the ball as Wighton tried to touch down. Very, very close but the Sea Eagles survive. Seconds later, it looks like Walker makes a line break and is clean through for a try - but it was suspiciously easy and, sure enough, the officials call it back for obstruction. You can sense a try coming. Basketball: Fresh from toppling Team USA, Andrew Bogut now has the Herald-Sun in his sights. NRL: 11 mins: Raiders 0-0 Sea Eagles It\u2019s a real tussle in Canberra, as you\u2019d expect from two teams right at the top of their games just before the finals. Nothing on the scoreboard so far. Some solid Manly defence keeps the Raiders at bay from a couple of sets. The visitors have been under pressure but look unruffled. AFL: Q2: 10 mins remaining: Richmond 6.6 (42) v Brisbane 3.1 (19) It\u2019s official - Richmond are ON today. Calculators at the ready. We\u2019re beyond 4pm on the final Sunday of the regular season and it\u2019s still all to play for in the top five. Which, of course, is entirely how you\u2019d want it to be. The only thing you can say for sure right now is that it\u2019s been a good year for clubs named after felines. If only they\u2019d been called the Gold Coast Ocelots. Thank you and au revoir to the tireless Jonathan Howcroft, who will return later to kick off our Ashes coverage. He\u2019s basically the Steve Smith of bloggers - almost impossible to remove. I\u2019ll put up an Ashes link nearer the time. And a nice start to the shift for yours truly - the deciding clash at the top of the AFL well under way, and the NRL\u2019s match of the round up next. Right, that\u2019s all from me for the time being. Richard Gadsby will steer you through the conclusion of Richmond v Brisbane and prepare you for a nail-biting night of Ashes action. It was an uncharacteristic opening half from the Melbourne Storm but they rectified their mistakes in the second term, blowing the Titans away at AAMI Park. AFL: QT: Richmond 6.2 (38) v Brisbane 2.1 (13) - Around the ground there\u2019s not too much separating these flag contenders but Richmond\u2019s power bursting out of midfield, and strength inside 50, has given the scoreboard a lopsided feel at quarter-time. Jack Riewoldt has four goals to his name already while the Tigers\u2019 array of dangerous midfielders and small forwards have been devastating. At this rate we\u2019re looking at a Geelong minor premiership and this pair facing off again in week one of the finals. Hawthorn\u2019s win in the west made for a fascinating start to Sunday\u2019s AFL action, but any intrigue lasted about two minutes as Bailey Dale fired the Bulldogs into an early lead they never looked like relinquishing. The Doggies finish seventh on the ladder, setting up a date away to GWS in the first week of the finals. They will go into that contest on the back of four thumping victories in their past five outings, including a 61-point thrashing of the Giants at Spotless Stadium last weekend. Dale ended with a Ballarat record five goals while Matt Crouch ended with an astonishing 47 disposals for the Crows. NRL: 60 mins: Storm 18-8 Titans - That\u2019s more like it from Melbourne. AFL: Q1: 17 mins remaining: Richmond 1.0 (6) v Brisbane 1.0 (6) - It\u2019s been a blistering start with both sides hitting the scoreboard early. With the MCG bathed in sunshine and a noisy crowd in attendance there is a superb finals-like feel to this. AFL: With the bottom of the eight looking sorted it\u2019s time to turn our attention to the top. The opening bounce for Richmond v Brisbane is seconds away and every position in the top five is open to change over the next four quarters. NRL: 44 mins: Storm 12-8 Titans - The answer to that question is an emphatic \u2018yes\u2019. Melbourne take immediate advantage of a sloppy start to the half by the Titans and normal service is resumed. NRL: Can the Storm return to their normal selves in the second half? AFL: 3QT: Bulldogs 14.11 (95) v Adelaide 8.6 (54) - The first of the day\u2019s permutations in the AFL has been all-but resolved with the Western Bulldogs on course to finish seventh on the ladder, dashing the hopes of Hawthorn and Adelaide, and rendering Port Adelaide\u2019s clash with Fremantle redundant. Bailey Dale has four goals for the Doggies while Matt Crouch is racking up an impressive stats sheet in a losing side. NRL: HT: Storm 6-8 Titans - That was a very un-Melbourne half from the ladder leaders. They barely saw the ball but when they did they couldn\u2019t keep hold of it. In defence there were penalties aplenty - including two against Cameron Munster for backchat - with the Titans taking an unlikely lead into half-time. The Magpies have done it, defeating the Vixens by 11 goals to keep their season alive. They needed to claim all eight points, or seven with a winning margin of at least seven points, and they did the latter in a nervy drawn final quarter. Aside from that frantic finale it was a statement derby performance at just the right time with these sides now meeting again next week in the minor semi-final. The winners of that contest play the loser of the Lightning v Swifts major semi-final in the prelim. NRL: 23 mins: Storm 0-8 Titans - This was supposed to be the lock of the season but Melbourne have completed just three sets at AAMI Park so far and trail the unheralded Gold Coast midway through the opening half. Super Netball: 3QT: Magpies 45-34 Vixens - That\u2019s three bonus points and a clear view of the finish line for the Magpies who are now just one quarter away from securing a stunning place in the Super Netball finals. With the margin as it stands (in excess of seven goals) the Magpies may not even require the final bonus point to leapfrog the Giants and into fourth place. NRL: 18 mins: Storm 0-8 Titans - Gold Coast have caught Melbourne napping at AAMI Park, taking the game to the Storm and hitting the scoreboard with a penalty and a converted try following some exciting broken field play. AFL: HT: Bulldogs 9.8 (62) v Adelaide 5.4 (34) - Better from the Crows in the second quarter but Bailey Dale\u2019s four goal haul still has the Bulldogs on course for September footy. NRL: The first of two rugby league fixtures for the day is underway. NFL: A surprising story coming out of the US with prized quarterback Andrew Luck announcing his retirement from the NFL. One of the most highly touted amateur prospects of his generation, Luck was chosen with the No 1 overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft as the Colts\u2019 successor to Peyton Manning following a decorated career at Stanford University. He immediately delivered on his promise, leading Indianapolis to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons, including a 2014 campaign where he threw a league-best 40 touchdown passes while helming the Colts to the AFC championship game. Super Netball: HT: Magpies 28-25 Vixens - That\u2019s the second bonus point for the Magpies and they remain on course for the finals at half-time. The second quarter was all about Nat Medhurst who illuminated Melbourne Arena with a goal rush and some blistering attacking play. The margin could have been greater but Shimona Nelson is not enjoying her finest afternoon in the circle. Super Netball: There\u2019s plenty of feeling in this Melbourne derby, but it\u2019s all going the Magpies\u2019 way on the scoreboard. AFL: QT: Bulldogs 6.5 (41) v Adelaide 2.0 (12) - Okay, so maybe we talked up the last day drama in the AFL a bit too much. The Bulldogs are steamrollering their way into September with a dominant opening quarter in Ballarat. Super Netball: QT: Magpies 14-12 Vixens - That\u2019s exactly the start the Magpies were hoping for in their quest to vault into the top four. The home side\u2019s defence was rock solid, with Geva Mentor again starring, denying Melbourne any swift mid-court ball movement. That\u2019s the first of eight points secured, can the Magpies finish the job? Agreed, everything about the aesthetic in Ballarat is appealing. Fans stood in the outer all rugged up, the players in well-designed and pleasingly contrasting uniforms, and a simple old fashioned venue. Super Netball: Magpies 1-1 Vixens - Underway now at Melbourne Arena in the final regular season fixture in Suncorp Super Netball. AFL: Q1: 18 mins remaining: Bulldogs 2.0 (12) v Adelaide 0.0 (0) - Make that two in two for the Doggies and Bailey Dale. Maybe the finals picture will be confirmed much earlier than expected. AFL: We\u2019re underway in Ballarat and the Doggies are already a goal up, scoring from the opening centre clearance. Cricket: Good news for Steve Smith who is recovering well from his concussion and looks on course for a return to Australia\u2019s XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Rugby: The finishing touches are being added to World Cup preparations and for the Wallabies that means making full use of the Giteau Law, as Bret Harris reports. Wallabies coach Michael Cheika devised the policy in 2015 to allow overseas-based players to be eligible to play for the Wallabies. He brought back Matt Giteau, for whom the law was named, and Drew Mitchell back from France for the World Cup that year. Previously, players had to play for Super Rugby clubs in Australia to be eligible to play for the Wallabies, but the Giteau Law created a whole new pool of offshore talent by relaxing the eligibility rules. Cricket: There\u2019ll be plenty of Ashes chat as the day goes on but let\u2019s first set the scene with Vic Marks\u2019s report from day three at Headingley. We are still here. When England were 15 for two in their seventh over with another 344 runs required for victory and 70 overs to be bowled in the day, swift exit possibilities were being explored. Now other possibilities, more unlikely but much more intriguing, have surfaced. In their pursuit of 359 for victory England were 156 for three at the close with Joe Root on home turf attempting to play the innings of his life. At stumps he was unbeaten on 75, which already constitutes his innings of the series. Tennis: The US Open begins on Monday and the draw for the wide open women\u2019s singles has delivered the most mouthwatering first round clash: Serena Williams v Maria Sharapova. There is no love lost between the two icons of their generation and what may prove to be the final match-up of their illustrious careers is sure to be full of intrigue. Kevin Mitchell has more. If Serena Williams really did say of Maria Sharapova in the Wimbledon locker room in tearful defeat 15 years ago, \u201cI will never lose to that little bitch again\u201d, she was wrong but she set in train the most impassioned and complex rivalry in tennis. Basketball: In amongst the live stuff there\u2019s no shortage of results to catch up on, starting with Australia\u2019s Boomers delivering one of the year\u2019s most eye-catching upsets in any sport by defeating a USA side that hadn\u2019t lost since 2006. US coach Gregg Popovich said the Boomers\u2019 performance was a lesson in teamwork for his team - many who have never played together before this campaign. He described his team as \u201cdiscombobulated\u201d and said they made some poor decisions but gave credit to the Australians. The unpredictability of sport is what keeps us coming back for more and today is a prime example. This edition of Sunday sportwatch begins with plenty unknown but will end with the finals program established in both Super Netball and the AFL, before we segue seamlessly into what could turn into the most exciting night of Test cricket in a generation. Here\u2019s the menu: 1pm - Super Netball: Magpies v Vixens. The final match of the home and away season is a Melbourne derby pitting fifth against third. The Magpies need every point on offer to crack the top four. The Vixens will travel to the Swifts in the first week of the finals whatever the result. 1.10pm - AFL: Bulldogs v Adelaide. A Bulldogs win will see them leap from ninth to seventh; defeat and their season is over. Thanks to Hawthorn\u2019s upset over in Perth the Crows now have to win by a cricket score to remain any hope of pipping the Hawks into eighth. 2pm - NRL: Storm v Titans. The best side this home and away season against the worst results in a fixture containing the least jeopardy of the afternoon. That could all change if Melbourne somehow contrive to lose to Gold Coast, but even with two defeats in their previous four outings that would still represent the shock of the campaign. 3.20pm - AFL: Richmond v Brisbane. Another AFL barnburner. It\u2019s fourth v second as things stand, but a Lions victory would hand them the most unlikely of minor premierships and in turn bump the Tigers down to fifth. A Richmond win would guarantee third place on the ladder while a victory margin of at least 63 points would see them replace Brisbane in second. 4.05pm - NRL: Raiders v Sea Eagles. The focus of NRL attention pits third against fifth. Victory for Canberra would all-but guarantee them third spot heading into the finals but defeat would drag them into a dogfight alongside two other sides on 14 wins. A win for Manly would elevate them into that 30-point logjam while defeat keeps them only points difference ahead of the sixth placed Eels. 4.40pm - AFL: Port Adelaide v Fremantle. Depending on the outcome of the Bulldogs v Adelaide contest this fixture could be a dead rubber. However, if the Crows get up then the Power are slim chance of sneaking into the top eight. To do so they would need at least a 95 point victory. 8pm - Cricket: Day four of the third Ashes Test. This will be on our minds all afternoon I\u2019m sure but from 8pm (liveblog kicking off at 7pm) we could be in for a slice of history if England can make a fist of chasing down the 203 runs required for an improbable series saving victory. I\u2019ll be around for the next few hours, after which Richard Gadsby will steer us towards Headingley. If you want to contribute while I\u2019m on deck you can reach me by email, or tweet @JPHowcroft. Comments will also be open below the line.",

Morito is informal and convivial. The cooking is somehow joyful, especially the sweet onion tortilla and crispy aubergines with dates. I sometimes meet my daughter there for a catch-up. We ooh and ahh over every morsel, and their aromatic house <em>aperitivo</em> (cava, grapefruit and tarragon) gets the thumbs up too. In summer we try to get a table outside, and usually end our rendezvous by sharing a perfect rum and raisin ice-cream. It\u2019s never too sweet and neither is my daughter. She tells me her friends are not obliged to see their parents as often as she does, so I\u2019m relying on Morito to put something new and enticing on the menu to help me out.</p> <h2>4.

It stars Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Antonio Banderas, who have long been Almod\u00f3var\u2019s cinematic avatars.

      "bodyText": "Born in 1962 in South Africa, Deborah Levy moved to England at the age of nine, where she studied contemporary arts at Dartington College of Arts. In 1989, she published her first collection of short stories, Ophelia and the Great Idea, and a second, Black Vodka, in 2013. Two of her novels, Swimming Home (2011) and Hot Milk (2016), were shortlisted for the Booker prize; her latest, The Man Who Saw Everything, (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a314.99) is published on 29 August. 1. Art Nandipha Mntambo Right now she is the artist who interests me most. Born in Swaziland, now living in Johannesburg, Mntambo\u2019s sculptures and films explore the boundaries between human and animal, femininity and masculinity, and so much more. I saw an exhibition of her work in January this year at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town and was blown away. Most memorable is a film installation about colonialism and machismo, in which the artist poses as a solo female matador in an empty, sun-parched arena. It\u2019s an artwork I want to look at every day. 2. Hobby Swimming Is swimming a hobby? I always carry my Speedo and goggles around with me just in case I bump into a swimming opportunity. Preferably wild swimming, but I\u2019ve long been doing the lengths in Brockwell lido and the Oasis in Holborn. I was once signing books at a literary festival in Norwich and two women in the queue told me they were digging a lake on their land. I was invited to try it out. How\u2019s it going? Just send word and I\u2019ll be there. 3. Restaurant Morito, London I have never been disappointed by the fresh and tasty tapas at Morito, the sister restaurant to Moro in Exmouth Market. Morito is informal and convivial. The cooking is somehow joyful, especially the sweet onion tortilla and crispy aubergines with dates. I sometimes meet my daughter there for a catch-up. We ooh and ahh over every morsel, and their aromatic house aperitivo (cava, grapefruit and tarragon) gets the thumbs up too. In summer we try to get a table outside, and usually end our rendezvous by sharing a perfect rum and raisin ice-cream. It\u2019s never too sweet and neither is my daughter. She tells me her friends are not obliged to see their parents as often as she does, so I\u2019m relying on Morito to put something new and enticing on the menu to help me out. 4. Film Pain and Glory (dir. Pedro Almod\u00f3var, 2019) I am a big fan of the exuberantly emotional and surreal sensibility in all the films of Pedro Almod\u00f3var. The title of his new film, Pain and Glory, just about sums up the last five years of my life. What\u2019s up with you, Pedro? I can\u2019t wait to find out. It stars Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Antonio Banderas, who have long been Almod\u00f3var\u2019s cinematic avatars. It\u2019s about a film director in some sort of medical and existential crisis, figuring out what gives life meaning, hope and value. As usual, Almod\u00f3var asks all the most interesting questions. 5. Place Marseilles I have only just discovered Marseilles. I like the ambience of this salty, gritty, exuberant port city. It is friendly, upbeat and cheaper than Paris. As for the coast, I found some of my best swimming experiences by walking through paths lined with pine trees, and then diving off the rocks into the glittering ocean known as the C\u00f4te Bleue. If you want a fish to be cooked for you while you swim, M\u00e9jean has one restaurant (always packed in summer) on the edge of its small port. 6. Documentary Knock Down the House (Netflix) This totally gripping documentary from Rachel Lears actually had me in tears. It\u2019s as tense as watching a thriller because there is so much at stake. It examines the 2018 primary campaigns of four progressive, grassroots, female Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

I\u2019d like to apologise for this in advance: regular readers of this column have become used to scintillating satire from these two, delivered via crisp, witty prose. What do I have to offer in return? Nothing but grim jeremiads about the dreadful state we\u2019re in \u2013 and pretentious, jargon-laden analyses about how we got here. True, I too was once a well-known light entertainer on national television, but in recent years I\u2019ve fallen victim to the worst character trait of the ageing farceur: a desire to be taken \u2026 seriously \u2013 an inclination that has, quite rightly, coincided with my gently smelly slide down into Stygian obscurity.</p> <p>Bobbing about down here, I\u2019ve begun to suspect that my status in our septic, MRSA-ridden isle exists in an inverse correlation to that of Her Highness\u2019s current first minister.

Throughout a number of barnstorming appearances, Johnson cemented his reputation as a charming and self-deprecating Old Etonian, whose tousled blond mop nonetheless surmounted a mind like a steel trap. Even at the time, commentators remarked on how bizarre it was that serving politicians were prepared to go on the show and risk being eviscerated by their fellow panellists \u2013 however, by perfecting his routine (in Marxist terms, his \u201cpraxis\u201d), Johnson enacted the dialectical relation between politics and comedy that has since typified our era.</p> <p>Yes, think of Johnson not as man but a sort of personified synthesis: one between the high-minded politics of old and the cachinnating prejudices of the new bigots.

She refers to her brain as \u201cfizzy\u201d more than once, and though she is more serious and reflective in conversation than her garrulous on-stage persona, she does tend to fizz. She speaks enthusiastically, in great long paragraphs that hoover up ideas from the air. \u201cSince I was really small, my mum says I wouldn\u2019t talk at breakfast because I would just read the back of the cereal packet,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI used to steal from the library, which is a crime and it\u2019s bad, but I just couldn\u2019t get enough books, and I also didn\u2019t like to give them back once I\u2019d read them. I just read everything. I get a fizzy thing in my brain, like a nice glass of wine, and I want to know facts and I want to understand.\u201d</p> <p>She was born in Dagenham, east London, and grew up in Romford, Essex; her parents divorced when she was small, and her father moved to Australia, leaving her mother to bring up her and her two younger sisters. They weren\u2019t particularly well off, \u201cbut not in any kind of tortured way\u201d. She takes her shoes off and points at her little toe. \u201cWhen I was little, I wore shoes that were too small for me for years, so my feet grew weird, so my little toenails grow and then they just fall off and then they grow again.\u201d One of her little toes is lacking a nail. She points at it. \u201cThat\u2019s the only sign of poverty on my body.\u201d</p> <p>She may do silly billy well, but much of Pascoe\u2019s comedy is personal and revealing, and on stage she often gives the impression of a woman who does not know what a boundary looks like. After watching her standup and reading her books, I feel as if I already know everything about her. \u201cWell you do, in a way,\u201d she says. Often, someone will come up to her after a gig and ask her how her mum is. \u201cI\u2019ll go, \u2018All right?\u2019\u201d she says, with mock-suspicion. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018Did this person go to school with my sister?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/john-robins-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019\" title=\"\">LadsLadsLads</a></em>, which followed her break-up with fellow comedian John Robins, she talked extensively about sex, being single and the celibate year she imposed upon herself after they split. (Robins gave his side of the story in his own show, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/15/john-robins-review-edinburgh-festival-sara-pascoe\" title=\"\">The Darkness of Robins</a></em>.) She met her current boyfriend, Australian comic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/20/steen-raskopoulos-review-underbelly-cowgate-edinburgh-fringe-festival\" title=\"\">Steen Raskopoulos</a>, doing comedy, too. \u201cComedy,\u201d she laughs. \u201cEveryone is comedy. There are horrible terms for women who only sleep with comedians. You\u2019ve heard \u2018gag hag\u2019, or my agent once called somebody a \u2018clown bike\u2019, which I hadn\u2019t heard. It\u2019s harsh, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut the reason I forgive myself is that I used to do gigs seven days a week, I didn\u2019t have a social life, and what tends to happen is that people have a drink after work, which means you\u2019re up quite late with people\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd793f05ffe1f9ab0d4f7bb18292827e9f234423\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd793f05ffe1f9ab0d4f7bb18292827e9f234423/0_0_4281_2569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Standup is your diary.

While she is certain that, \u201cStandup is a place where, as long as it\u2019s funny enough, you can say your most embarrassing things, shameful things and disappointing things,\u201d she has learned that mentioning real people has consequences, particularly when she includes her family. \u201cMy dad lives in Australia, and my mum brought us up pretty much by herself, but he\u2019s in my life now and I really love him,\u201d she says. Some of her family have a WhatsApp group, and will talk about her TV appearances on it. \u201cAnd I have the potential to hugely hurt my dad with tiny little asides. I\u2019ll just say this thing about, \u2018My dad didn\u2019t love me,\u2019 and it\u2019s just stupid and then it distills back down to this little jagged thing in the heart that you\u2019re nearly 40 and still not over it.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of years ago Pascoe was on the laddy weekend breakfast show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/16/something-for-the-weekend-channel-4\" title=\"\">Sunday Brunch</a></em>. \u201cI\u2019m glad you brought that up,\u201d she says, looking entertained. During a recipe segment, host Tim Lovejoy asked what she would and would not use for material. \u201cPeople\u2026 might think you\u2019re trying to make them look stupid,\u201d she explained, before adding, cheerfully, \u201cOr they don\u2019t want everyone to know about their abortion, so you have to double-check.\u201d You could feel the tension radiating out from the screen. \u201cThey acted like I\u2019d said I kill babies,\u201d she says now, laughing but incredulous. \u201cLike, I knife them in the head, like I\u2019ll give anyone an abortion who\u2019s watching. I mean honestly, they acted like I\u2019d said something so crude. Part of having it as a human right is that it\u2019s also possible to talk about it without shame. Even on breakfast TV sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Pascoe wrote about her own experience of abortion in <em>Animals</em>. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mariestopes.org.uk/frequently-asked-questions/\" title=\"\">One in three</a> of their female viewers will have had a termination. And I really checked myself afterwards, like, \u2018Do I regret it?\u2019 But it was just the worst thing I could think about at the time, as in, in terms of if you were going to expose someone.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve never gone on again.\u201d</p> <p>One of the funniest lines in <em>LadsLadsLads</em> has her explaining that standup comedy is: \u201cJust telling other people things about yourself that you should be very ashamed of and them thinking you\u2019re joking.\u201d She is aware of the contrast between what she does now and her early ambitions, which were notably more earnest. Pascoe had no desire to be a comic. She wanted to be a serious actor. She was studying English at the University of Sussex when she saw a piece of physical theatre about chimps learning sign language, obviously, and had an epiphany. She wanted to do political theatre, she wanted to agitate, she wanted to help change the world through art. She laughs. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve ended up doing silly billy.\u201d</p> <p>For a while, she didn\u2019t even like comedy, though watching <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-mighty-boosh\" title=\"\">The Mighty Boosh</a></em> in her 20s cured her of her prejudices. \u201cI really loved the ridiculousness of it and I thought it was so charming. I don\u2019t think I realised that adults could be stupid as well.\u201d</p> <p>It was going out with a standup comedian and then breaking up with him that led her to pick up a microphone. \u201cI went to watch him do a gig and it was boys holding notepads being terrible. And I was like, \u2018Oh I can do that. I can be terrible with a notepad!\u201d When they broke up, the pieces fell into place. \u201cA broken heart is a perfect time to do standup, because if it\u2019s been a horrible heartbreak, you\u2019re at the bottom of your own barrel. If you go on stage with nothing to lose, nothing bad can happen, and it actually makes you quite fearless.\u201d She also thought that doing comedy herself would help her understand her ex. \u201cAnd the second I did standup, I understood <em>everything</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Her first gig was to 12 people in Balham and nobody really laughed. \u201cI had a medium-to-bad time. But you get a physiological reward when you do something that scares you. For me, it was this lightning bolt of, ohhh, <em>this</em> is what I was meant to do.\u201d She had been an actor, a tour guide, a backing singer in a hotel near Nottingham for Robbie Williams\u2019s dad, but finally, she had found her calling.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d been writing a diary since I was 14, and standup is your diary. You just work out which bits to tell people, but it is your diary. I was like, \u2018This is it, it\u2019s like Shakespeare\u2019s time, you\u2019re a one-man band, you go from town square to town square and you lay out your stall and you tell your stories.\u2019 My dad is a jazz musician, and he must have seen me do a terrible gig, because they were all terrible for years, but maybe three months in he said, \u2018You\u2019ve cracked it. You\u2019re just going to be you, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pascoe has now entered that rare club of comedians who are household names. Partly, it\u2019s because she\u2019s been a prolific guest on panel shows like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/12/fridays-best-tv-shed-of-the-year-8-out-of-10-cats-does-countdown-friday-night-dinner\" title=\"\">8 Out of 10 Cats</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jun/16/mock-the-week-ninth-series\" title=\"\">Mock the Week</a></em>. Contrary to the usual line about how women rarely enjoy doing them, Pascoe absolutely loves doing panel shows. \u201cA panel show is, would you like thousands of pounds? Yes please. Would you like to come and sit with your friends? Yes please. Do you want a wine in a mug? Yes please. Oh, buy yourself a new dress, why don\u2019t you? All you have to do is sit there and talk to your friends and then someone edits your worst bits out. It\u2019s like the best version of you on your night out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fefa1729ba87c641199d41838b119419daa2337f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fefa1729ba87c641199d41838b119419daa2337f/80_311_3306_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A panel show is, would you like thousands of pounds?

I just bought a house, I can get a dog, so this is the happiest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p> <p>Having money means Pascoe has time, too, in a way that she\u2019s never had time before. She wants to do an economics degree and she wants to write a novel. \u201cThis is going to sound audacious, but hear me out,\u201d she says. \u201cIn terms of long-term ambitions, I really wanted to be an actor until I was 40, and then I wanted to write novels, and then I wanted to be prime minister.\u201d She laughs, but she is totally serious. A few years ago, she appeared to be considering giving up comedy entirely to pursue politics instead. \u201cBut I really went off the idea of politics,\u201d she says. She grew frustrated at the system, at how little it would be possible to change.</p> <p>Given how on-track her life has been so far, doesn\u2019t that scupper the big plan? \u201cWhen Boris got in, I started thinking, \u2018Hang on!\u2019 Obviously you say stuff in standup and think, \u2018I could never be a politician now. I\u2019ve talked openly about having an abortion, or I\u2019ve had sex with loads of people.\u2019 And then <em>Boris</em> gets in.\u201d She smiles widely. \u201cDo you know what?

She takes her shoes off and points at her little toe. \u201cWhen I was little, I wore shoes that were too small for me for years, so my feet grew weird, so my little toenails grow and then they just fall off and then they grow again.\u201d One of her little toes is lacking a nail. She points at it. \u201cThat\u2019s the only sign of poverty on my body.\u201d She may do silly billy well, but much of Pascoe\u2019s comedy is personal and revealing, and on stage she often gives the impression of a woman who does not know what a boundary looks like. After watching her standup and reading her books, I feel as if I already know everything about her. \u201cWell you do, in a way,\u201d she says. Often, someone will come up to her after a gig and ask her how her mum is. \u201cI\u2019ll go, \u2018All right?\u2019\u201d she says, with mock-suspicion. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018Did this person go to school with my sister?\u2019\u201d In LadsLadsLads, which followed her break-up with fellow comedian John Robins, she talked extensively about sex, being single and the celibate year she imposed upon herself after they split. (Robins gave his side of the story in his own show, The Darkness of Robins.) She met her current boyfriend, Australian comic Steen Raskopoulos, doing comedy, too. \u201cComedy,\u201d she laughs. \u201cEveryone is comedy. There are horrible terms for women who only sleep with comedians. You\u2019ve heard \u2018gag hag\u2019, or my agent once called somebody a \u2018clown bike\u2019, which I hadn\u2019t heard. It\u2019s harsh, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut the reason I forgive myself is that I used to do gigs seven days a week, I didn\u2019t have a social life, and what tends to happen is that people have a drink after work, which means you\u2019re up quite late with people\u2026\u201d She says she never fancies anyone straight away. \u201cBut then you see them for the third or fourth time, and think, \u2018Oh I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that person at the gig tonight.\u2019 And also, you get to hear them do their stuff, and they\u2019re either good at their job, which is sexy, and you get to learn a little bit about them, and then there are some people you might think are sexy and you hear their standup and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, what an awful person.\u2019\u201d As Pascoe\u2019s star has risen, she has come to understand the reach of what she talks about on stage. While she is certain that, \u201cStandup is a place where, as long as it\u2019s funny enough, you can say your most embarrassing things, shameful things and disappointing things,\u201d she has learned that mentioning real people has consequences, particularly when she includes her family. \u201cMy dad lives in Australia, and my mum brought us up pretty much by herself, but he\u2019s in my life now and I really love him,\u201d she says. Some of her family have a WhatsApp group, and will talk about her TV appearances on it. \u201cAnd I have the potential to hugely hurt my dad with tiny little asides. I\u2019ll just say this thing about, \u2018My dad didn\u2019t love me,\u2019 and it\u2019s just stupid and then it distills back down to this little jagged thing in the heart that you\u2019re nearly 40 and still not over it.\u201d A couple of years ago Pascoe was on the laddy weekend breakfast show Sunday Brunch. \u201cI\u2019m glad you brought that up,\u201d she says, looking entertained. During a recipe segment, host Tim Lovejoy asked what she would and would not use for material. \u201cPeople\u2026 might think you\u2019re trying to make them look stupid,\u201d she explained, before adding, cheerfully, \u201cOr they don\u2019t want everyone to know about their abortion, so you have to double-check.\u201d You could feel the tension radiating out from the screen. \u201cThey acted like I\u2019d said I kill babies,\u201d she says now, laughing but incredulous. \u201cLike, I knife them in the head, like I\u2019ll give anyone an abortion who\u2019s watching. I mean honestly, they acted like I\u2019d said something so crude. Part of having it as a human right is that it\u2019s also possible to talk about it without shame. Even on breakfast TV sometimes.\u201d Pascoe wrote about her own experience of abortion in Animals. \u201cOne in three of their female viewers will have had a termination. And I really checked myself afterwards, like, \u2018Do I regret it?\u2019 But it was just the worst thing I could think about at the time, as in, in terms of if you were going to expose someone.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve never gone on again.\u201d One of the funniest lines in LadsLadsLads has her explaining that standup comedy is: \u201cJust telling other people things about yourself that you should be very ashamed of and them thinking you\u2019re joking.\u201d She is aware of the contrast between what she does now and her early ambitions, which were notably more earnest. Pascoe had no desire to be a comic. She wanted to be a serious actor. She was studying English at the University of Sussex when she saw a piece of physical theatre about chimps learning sign language, obviously, and had an epiphany. She wanted to do political theatre, she wanted to agitate, she wanted to help change the world through art. She laughs. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve ended up doing silly billy.\u201d For a while, she didn\u2019t even like comedy, though watching The Mighty Boosh in her 20s cured her of her prejudices. \u201cI really loved the ridiculousness of it and I thought it was so charming. I don\u2019t think I realised that adults could be stupid as well.\u201d It was going out with a standup comedian and then breaking up with him that led her to pick up a microphone. \u201cI went to watch him do a gig and it was boys holding notepads being terrible. And I was like, \u2018Oh I can do that. I can be terrible with a notepad!\u201d When they broke up, the pieces fell into place. \u201cA broken heart is a perfect time to do standup, because if it\u2019s been a horrible heartbreak, you\u2019re at the bottom of your own barrel. If you go on stage with nothing to lose, nothing bad can happen, and it actually makes you quite fearless.\u201d She also thought that doing comedy herself would help her understand her ex. \u201cAnd the second I did standup, I understood everything.\u201d Her first gig was to 12 people in Balham and nobody really laughed. \u201cI had a medium-to-bad time. But you get a physiological reward when you do something that scares you. For me, it was this lightning bolt of, ohhh, this is what I was meant to do.\u201d She had been an actor, a tour guide, a backing singer in a hotel near Nottingham for Robbie Williams\u2019s dad, but finally, she had found her calling. \u201cI\u2019d been writing a diary since I was 14, and standup is your diary. You just work out which bits to tell people, but it is your diary. I was like, \u2018This is it, it\u2019s like Shakespeare\u2019s time, you\u2019re a one-man band, you go from town square to town square and you lay out your stall and you tell your stories.\u2019 My dad is a jazz musician, and he must have seen me do a terrible gig, because they were all terrible for years, but maybe three months in he said, \u2018You\u2019ve cracked it. You\u2019re just going to be you, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d Pascoe has now entered that rare club of comedians who are household names. Partly, it\u2019s because she\u2019s been a prolific guest on panel shows like 8 Out of 10 Cats and Mock the Week. Contrary to the usual line about how women rarely enjoy doing them, Pascoe absolutely loves doing panel shows. \u201cA panel show is, would you like thousands of pounds? Yes please. Would you like to come and sit with your friends? Yes please. Do you want a wine in a mug? Yes please. Oh, buy yourself a new dress, why don\u2019t you? All you have to do is sit there and talk to your friends and then someone edits your worst bits out. It\u2019s like the best version of you on your night out.\u201d She readily admits that, over the past couple of years, her life has changed completely. \u201cWell, you have much more money, that\u2019s hugely life-changing; people don\u2019t talk about it very much because you\u2019re supposed to be really embarrassed.\u201d She says she often talks to other comedians about how much she\u2019s being paid, so they can all negotiate better. \u201cMoney is so connected to freedom, autonomy, options, owning property. I just bought a house, I can get a dog, so this is the happiest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d Having money means Pascoe has time, too, in a way that she\u2019s never had time before. She wants to do an economics degree and she wants to write a novel. \u201cThis is going to sound audacious, but hear me out,\u201d she says. \u201cIn terms of long-term ambitions, I really wanted to be an actor until I was 40, and then I wanted to write novels, and then I wanted to be prime minister.\u201d She laughs, but she is totally serious. A few years ago, she appeared to be considering giving up comedy entirely to pursue politics instead. \u201cBut I really went off the idea of politics,\u201d she says. She grew frustrated at the system, at how little it would be possible to change. Given how on-track her life has been so far, doesn\u2019t that scupper the big plan? \u201cWhen Boris got in, I started thinking, \u2018Hang on!\u2019 Obviously you say stuff in standup and think, \u2018I could never be a politician now. I\u2019ve talked openly about having an abortion, or I\u2019ve had sex with loads of people.\u2019 And then Boris gets in.\u201d She smiles widely. \u201cDo you know what? Just don\u2019t apologise.\u201d Sex Power Money is published by Faber on 29 August at \u00a314.99.

      "bodyText": "With the trade war between the United States and China spiralling, and world leaders gathering in France for the G7 summit, Australia\u2019s central bank governor Philip Lowe has issued a stark warning that there is only limited capacity to protect the global economy from \u201ca period of major political shocks\u201d. Lowe used a contribution at the closing session of a retreat for central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to argue that political shocks, like the trade dispute which imperils global growth, the turbulence created by Brexit, and protests in Hong Kong, were \u201cturning into economic shocks\u201d. The RBA governor said central banks could not neutralise political instability. Lowe said infrastructure investment and structural reform in economies around the world would have more impact than cutting interest rates, but \u201cwith these three levers stuck, the challenge we face is monetary policy is carrying too much of a burden\u201d. \u201cMonetary policy cannot deliver medium-term growth,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cWe risk just pushing up asset prices\u201d. Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric before his departure for the G7 \u2013 which included an attack on the US central bank, and a declaration that American companies get out of China \u2013 caused a sharp dive on financial markets. The tirade from the American president followed a signal by China that it would impose $75bn in tariffs on American imports in retaliation to Trump\u2019s declaration in late July that the US would impose 10% tariffs on $300bn worth of Chinese imports. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, is expected to catch up with Trump in a \u201cpull aside\u201d meeting at the G7, and also have his first sit down meeting with the British prime minister Boris Johnson. Morrison will travel to Washington next month. Australia has been urging Washington and Beijing to de-escalate the current trade tensions, and Trump will hear similar appeals from other world leaders in Biarritz, including Johnson. Australia\u2019s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has noted that the actions the US has taken could contravene World Trade Organisation rules. As Morrison headed for the G7, where Australia will be an observer at the gathering and participate in sessions about climate change and the digital economy, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg said bystanders were being harmed in the trade war. \u201cWhen you had trade tensions between the two big players, the United States and China, it\u2019s not just the protagonists who are affected, but it\u2019s the bystanders as well\u201d. \u201cSome of those tensions are on our doorstep,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cI\u2019m working and talking to the treasury on a daily basis about the overall impact on the global economy and the impact on us here in Australia, including the trade tensions\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The camera focuses on Sama\u2019s face. She is the sweetest baby and looks, at first glance, as though her life might be ordinary. Her eyes are a transitory newborn colour, greyish green, waiting to turn brown. Her gold earrings look over-large in her tiny ears. Sama means sky in Arabic \u2013 a sky, as her mother imagines it, where no bombs fall, with ordinary clouds and sunshine. So far, this is footage that could be the work of any doting parent, but Sama\u2019s mother is journalist Waad al-Kateab and this is her documentary <em>For Sama</em>, filmed during the Syrian war. In the film al-Kateab sings a lullaby that almost lulls us \u2013 if not Sama \u2013 into a false sense of security. Sama is chewing her toe investigatively, as babies do, when a tank shell explodes. It sounds like a nightmare next-door neighbour heaving heavy furniture about and there is a shout: \u201cDownstairs, downstairs, there\u2019s another one coming\u2026\u201d It is the summer of 2016, the beginning of the siege of Aleppo. The camera loses focus, swerves incoherently. Al-Kateab calmly asks someone to \u201ctake Sama\u201d. By now, the shells are deafening.</p> <p>\u201cThis is insane \u2013 we\u2019re getting this every day,\u201d she goes on in her low, musical voice \u2013 her calm as abnormal as her situation (during the siege there were cluster bombs, chlorine gas, barrel bombs and air strikes). There is fire at the end of their corridor and smoke pours in. They live in the hospital that her husband, Hamza, has started from scratch. And now they are moving a baby on life support and Hamza is shouting: \u201cCome on! We need to pump the ventilators by hand.\u201d In the dark, al-Kateab calls out: \u201cWho\u2019s got Sama?\u201d</p> <p>A UN spokesman recently said the world had become \u201cnumb to the carnage\u201d in Syria after more than eight years of war and that even the rising death toll in Idlib \u2013 the country\u2019s last rebel-held stronghold \u2013 was being met by \u201ca collective shrug\u201d. No wonder al-Kateab feared her film \u2013 which starts with the peaceful protests against President Bashar Al-Assad in 2011 and goes on through the Arab spring to the sacking of Aleppo by regime forces in 2016 \u2013 would be greeted with indifference. But the reaction has been unanimous and overwhelming: audiences in every country in which the film has been shown stand and clap (at Cannes in May, they apparently did so for six minutes).</p> <p>Al-Kateab started out as a citizen journalist for Channel 4 news and has already been acclaimed for her harrowing and human series of reports Inside Aleppo (for which she has won an Emmy and the foreign affairs prize at the British journalism awards). But this film, dedicated to her daughter, is more personal. This is a mother\u2019s film in which the normal rhythms of parenthood become disrupted. Al-Kateab worries that nappies and baby formula will run out. Toddlers use a bombed bus as their playground, painting it all the colours of the rainbow (even little Sama is helped to wield a brush) and al-Kateab\u2019s stoical best friend Afraa never loses the twinkle in her eye as she keeps quiet about weevils she finds in the rice. In the unreality of war, the domesticity startles: an ordinary cooking pot looks outlandish. But this is <em>For Sama\u2019s</em> strength: the tender stuff of family life, often ignored in war reporting, is all there. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsvBqtg2RM0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vsvBqtg2RM0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsvBqtg2RM0\">Watch a trailer for For Sama.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Already garlanded with awards including best documentary at the Cannes and SXSW film festivals and a special jury prize at Hot Docs, <em>For Sama</em> also shows what it is to destroy a family. We see mothers in fierce, tearless overdrive, like figures from Shakespearean tragedy. One mother searching for her son, Mohammad, gives us the film\u2019s most revealing line. On finding his dead body she postpones the evidence of what she sees, crying hysterically: \u201cIt\u2019s Mummy, I\u2019ve got your milk, wake up!\u201d At this moment, she sees al-Kateab filming. What you expect her to say is: \u201cHow dare you?\u201d Instead, she screams at the top of her voice: \u201cFilm this!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy lens,\u201d al-Kateab says now, \u201cwas, for her, the world outside. She wanted her grief witnessed.\u201d</p> <p>Last week \u2013 three years later \u2013 a small girl skips along the corridor of a photographic studio in north London, holding the hand of a babysitter. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mama?\u201d she calls out. Sama is about to join her mother and have her picture taken. She does several experimental twirls in her flowery frock and puts on her shoes with satisfaction. The moment comes to comb her hair: Mama must do it. Sama prefers not to stand still. Asked how old she is, she holds up three fingers, eyes shining. She is an enchanting child, extraordinarily animated. Her mother, beautiful and immaculately dressed \u2013 responding to her daughter at every turn \u2013 is still by contrast. Looking at them after having seen the film, one feels a marvelling gratitude that they have survived. It seems bordering on unreal that she and her family have swapped east Aleppo for east London (she is currently employed by <em>Channel 4 News</em>/ITN).</p> <p>The family was compelled to leave Syria on 21 December 2016 (the city\u2019s sixth month under siege). Hamza was recognised \u2013 as manager of the only surviving hospital and responsible for civilian healthcare in east Aleppo\u2019s last besieged quarter \u2013 to be one of the most significant figures in the civilian administration area and it was he who received the phone call from the UN with a message from the Russians to say that if those remaining in Aleppo wanted to survive, they must surrender and go into exile immediately. Al-Kateab asks in the film: \u201cSama, will you remember Aleppo? Will you blame me for staying here? Or blame me for leaving now?\u201d They had never intended to leave. And, in one sense al-Kateab (not her real name, she uses the pseudonym to protect her relatives) has never left: she brought Syria with her to the UK, arriving with a dozen hard drives initially cut down to 300 hours of footage \u2013 which she then spent two years, with fellow director Edward Watts (an independent film-maker who has made more than 20 documentaries), editing into their 95-minute film.</p> <p>Watching her having her picture taken, she seems professional and aloof \u2013 as if elsewhere (as she presumably feels she is). But as she sits down beside me on a small sofa, that changes. Attentive and warm, she pats my arm to emphasise her points. \u201cI filmed everything,\u201d she explains. Selecting material for the film, the challenge was to achieve a balance between \u201cdark and light, life and death\u201d. At first, she had felt adamant that showing the worst was what mattered: her footage was \u201cevidence\u201d. But then, as Watts explains on the phone, they ran an early test screening at Channel 4, for friends and family \u2013 \u201cjust 15 people or so\u201d \u2013 and realised they had \u201cgone too far into the darkness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c01abdc6bd8932d5878c246bc30c0819d3d5bf55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c01abdc6bd8932d5878c246bc30c0819d3d5bf55/441_1262_5387_6732/800.jpg\" alt=\"Waad al-Kateab and her daughter Sama in London last month.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waad al-Kateab and her daughter Sama in London last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their first cut was in chronological order. It started with hope, descended into despair. This, they realised, did not work. It is hard to imagine more devastating images than those shown in the film, but al-Kateab and Watts insist many were worse \u2013 including \u201ca pile of very young children\u2019s dead bodies\u201d abandoned at a hospital. The audience could not cope and sometimes, during editing, Watts had found himself putting his hand in front of the screen. They had to think again. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the Syrian war and more than 10 million displaced, and while audiences needed to be aware of \u201ccarnage en masse\u201d, this had not to be at the expense of individual dignity.</p> <p>The collaboration between al-Kateab and Watts started uncertainly because they were in different countries: she was in Turkey (where her family spent a year after fleeing Syria), he was in London. She applied for asylum in the UK on the basis that she and Hamza were targets for reprisals by the regime and on the strength of their work for Channel 4 news and in east Aleppo. Her story had received attention in parliament during the 2016 siege and with the backing of <em>Channel 4 News</em>, her case was swiftly processed. Making the film, al-Kateab had been understandably nervous that a foreigner might falsify or appropriate her emotional copyright. But nowadays, she happily declares that, while most collaborators \u201cstart together and end apart\u201d, she and Watts went the opposite way. It was Watts who had the brainwave to make Sama the key to structuring the film and they discovered that, with a flashback format, they could move between dark and light, with Sama as their \u2013 and our \u2013 lifeline. And, by this stage, the film was becoming a love story.</p> <p>It begins with 18-year-old al-Kateab (she is 26 now) about to study economics at Aleppo university. Hamza is a close friend but married to someone else. She describes him as having the gift of making her feel safe with \u201ca constant smile on his face\u201d. One of the few doctors in Aleppo who is also an activist, his smile is to be tested in the years that follow. East Aleppo lacks schools and emergency and medical services \u2013 thus the urgent need for his hospital. We watch him at work: a confidence-inspiring hero \u2013 his makeshift hospital run, extraordinarily impressively, partly on willpower. In the weeks before they leave the country, the hospital (Hamza\u2019s second after the first was destroyed by bombs) performed 890 operations in 20 days and received 6,000 wounded people.</p> <p>One scene shows a massacre in east Aleppo. Al-Kateab films the rows of bodies hauled out of a river \u2013 like a dormitory for the dead. Heads stick out of the tops of blue sleeping bags, awaiting identification. These civilians have been handcuffed, tortured and executed. Their crime? They lived in \u201careas opposed to the regime\u201d. Hamza\u2019s smile has gone but his composure is holding. As corpses are thrown in makeshift shrouds into a mass grave, there is high and defiant singing: \u201cOur dead have gone to paradise.\u201d</p> <p>When Hamza\u2019s wife urges him to flee the country, he chooses Syria over his first marriage. Armed rebels by this point have freed the city but retaliation is intensifying. Al-Kateab\u2019s camera repeatedly shows terrible smoke on the horizon, rising above the city\u2019s brick buildings like grey plumage. She explains that she started filming on a mobile, graduated to a camera and even borrowed a drone from a friend (she had trouble learning to use it but eventually got superb results).</p> <p>Hamza has come up with a rule for the two of them: no crying in hospital. \u201cHe explained that people saw me as powerful because I was filming and believed in the revolution. If they saw me break down, however strong they might be, it would weaken them. And Hamza felt he had to have strength for everyone. He was a leader.\u201d Hospital staff used to tell her: \u201cWe\u2019re very strong because of Hamza \u2013 he is very cool.\u201d</p> <p>But one day, watching an attempt to save a boy\u2019s life, al-Kateab cannot help herself. Hamza ticks her off: \u201cYou can\u2019t cry in here \u2013 get out.\u201d But then he goes after her. It is striking how often in the film people ask one another: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It seems a redundant question, the answer everywhere to be seen. Al-Kateab agrees but explains: \u201cIt\u2019s about care. Even though I might know you have lost your child, it\u2019s my way of asking what\u2019s going on in your heart.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e742987f09f19994e4801a61d8b8e6c4978790c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e742987f09f19994e4801a61d8b8e6c4978790c/0_129_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sama at the end of the documentary holding a sign that formed al-Kateab\u2019s response to US presidential candidate Gary Johnson\u2019s remark, \u2018What\u2019s Aleppo?\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sama at the end of the documentary holding a sign that formed al-Kateab\u2019s response to US presidential candidate Gary Johnson\u2019s remark, \u2018What\u2019s Aleppo?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CAP/PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hamza told her: \u201cDon\u2019t you realise I\u2019m in love with you? Will you marry me?\u201d The film answers his question with footage of their wedding: Hamza in black suit and lilac tie, Waad in a veil with white silk roses in her hair. Confetti falls through the air, as though there might still be room for a fairytale in Aleppo. It is one of the rare times the camera is not in al-Kateab\u2019s hands. They dance to Willie Nelson\u2019s Crazy and Hamza tells her: \u201cThis is the road we\u2019re taking, it is a long road full of danger and fear but freedom waits for us at the end.\u201d The tenderness of the dancing is offset by what is, in a sense, their most dangerous wedding vow: \u201cCome, let\u2019s walk it together.\u201d</p> <p>In the early days, friends would tease: \u201cThey\u2019d say: Waad\u2019s playing with her camera again\u2026\u201d This changed after one of their dearest friends, Gaith \u2013 a nurse \u2013 and his brother Mahmoud were killed in an air raid. \u201cWe had lost Gaith,\u201d says al-Kateab. \u201cWe knew he was never coming back to this Earth but had this incredible footage of him laughing, working, sad\u2026 the life he\u2019d shared was recorded.\u201d Filming was remembering and the people who once mocked now apologised.</p> <p>Sama\u2019s birth is an ordinary \u2013 and extraordinary \u2013 event, discreetly presented. We see her friends with ears pressed to the door of the hospital room, listening out for the baby\u2019s first cry and jumping for joy when they hear it. Al-Kateab is then seen crying, holding Sama in her arms \u2013 and Hamza teasingly tells her to stop upsetting their baby. What was in her mind? \u201cI was crying because this was a room where two of my friends \u2013 Gaith and Omar \u2013 used to work before they were killed. I was thinking: I\u2019ve brought life to this place. I\u2019d been terrified I\u2019d not live to see Sama born. I was terrified about the future but also so happy. I could see Hamza\u2019s and my story in Sama\u2019s face. Yet I missed Gaith and Omar and wished they were alive.\u201d</p> <p>If filming was remembering, it was also, crucially, about resistance. Al-Kateab emphasises new media\u2019s role in the Arab spring: \u201cMobiles became the only way to show the world that we were fighting for our freedom.\u201d Early student protests were peaceful and festive with fireworks and dancing in the streets. But by 2015, the security forces were beating up student protesters. \u201cThey\u2019d turn up and five minutes later, the place would empty. A presenter from the official channel would ask: \u2018Has anything happened here?\u2019 \u2018No, nothing,\u2019 the remaining students would reply.\u201d Al-Kateab\u2019s footage would capsize that lie. Similarly, she would later secure evidence that Assad\u2019s regime was using chemical weapons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7b66ad675e23a5cf464ad3c966cd62bda8bb190\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7b66ad675e23a5cf464ad3c966cd62bda8bb190/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from al-Kateab\u2019s coverage of the siege of Aleppo broadcast on Channel 4 News.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from al-Kateab\u2019s coverage of the siege of Aleppo broadcast on Channel 4 News.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Waad al-Kateab/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, filming became her way of surviving: \u201cIt gave me a reason to stay in Aleppo. If I was killed, I\u2019d be leaving something important behind.\u201d Not that it gave her distance on what was happening. It was \u201cdoubly harrowing\u201d and \u201cbrought everything closer\u201d. But for many people, the camera represented hope. And while on the subject, I tell her that, strangely, it was the moments of hope in the film that undid me \u2013 all the more moving for being unexpected. A woman who is nine months pregnant is carried into hospital unconscious. An emergency caesarean is performed. We see the baby pulled out \u2013 lifeless. The misery of it is sickening. War has killed him. Capable gloved hands palpitate the little chest to start the lungs \u2013 surely in vain. The nurse briskly brushes his body with a sweeping movement. They hold him upside down and shake and slap and, just as we have given up on his slippery, grey body, he opens his eyes and cries \u2013 and everyone who sees it will join in. God be praised! His furious frown is a triumph, his cry defies Assad (they save the mother as well). \u201cIt is a miracle,\u201d al-Kateab exclaims. \u201cIt gives us the strength to stay in the struggle.\u201d</p> <p>But for her, too, hope is hardest to handle: \u201cWhenever I watch the film, it is when everyone else is laughing that I cry. We were creating hope and it was destroyed by the violence of the regime and by the Russians. At the last screening, sitting next to Ed, I started crying as I watched the early days of the revolution. And he was asking me: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d And I said: \u201cIt\u2019s the hope.\u201d</p> <p>But there has been another, more manageable, version of hope too \u2013 in people\u2019s reactions to the film: \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing \u2013 audiences have given me hope, shown me they really care. I\u2019ve been to Nantucket, Washington, Toronto, and even film distributors, who normally sample a film for 10 minutes and then leave, have stayed and been very moved.\u201d When people went \u201ccrazy\u201d in Cannes, she says, \u201cI can\u2019t describe how proud and happy it made me.\u201d</p> <p>It will be years before Sama is old enough to see the film made in her name. Al-Kateab addresses her in the film like this: \u201cSama, I know you understand what is happening. I can see it in your eyes. You never cry like a normal baby would. That\u2019s what breaks my heart.\u201d Now she confirms that, on some level, \u201cSama understood everything. That time I was looking for her during the bombing, I found her sleeping in a very quiet way\u201d. Her second daughter, Taima (she became pregnant again while still in Aleppo, the baby was born in Turkey) reacts in a \u201ctotally different way. If a bottle of milk drops, she cries. Sama used to fall from a high bed and not make a sound. But I\u2019d sometimes sense she was scared.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9cc05bd0fba5472496ba3f6f35d40d3d125f3a06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc05bd0fba5472496ba3f6f35d40d3d125f3a06/317_0_4853_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Al-Kateab filming in Aleppo during the civil war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Al-Kateab filming in Aleppo during the civil war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CAP/PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After leaving Syria, Sama used to wake in the night screaming. They consulted experts \u2013 she is doing better now. Better than her mother, who says: \u201cI still suffer from nightmares. And whenever I hear a very loud sound \u2013 like a train \u2013 I feel it in my body. I tried to seek therapy but it did not work for me.\u201d She has said in the past that her therapist (whom she now wants me to know is \u201camazing\u201d and says she \u201cloves\u201d) herself needed therapy after their sessions together.</p> <p>The film\u2019s most extraordinary achievement is that, instead of leaving one helpless, it creates resolve. Everyone who sees it feels the same. Al-Kateab says audiences come to her moved and energised and with one question: what can we do? The first step is \u201cunderstanding\u201d, she says \u2013 especially at a point where Idlib\u2019s suffering is starting to resemble Aleppo\u2019s. And she gets out her phone to play the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question\" title=\"\"> infamous September 2016 interview</a> with US presidential candidate Gary Johnson. Asked about his plans for Aleppo, he replies gormlessly: \u201cWhat\u2019s Aleppo?\u201d It was this interview that stung Al-Kateab into making the banner seven-month-old Sama holds at the end of the film with their city of ash as a backdrop. It reads: THIS IS ALEPPO. WHAT\u2019S JUSTICE?</p> <p>As well as the need for understanding, she hopes for support for the campaign she and Hamza plan to launch next month on <a href=\"https://www.forsamafilm.com/\" title=\"\">forsamafilm.com</a>, to \u201cstop bombing hospitals\u201d. She argues that the bombing of hospitals is now a \u201cworldwide\u201d problem. When Hamza\u2019s hospital is bombed, it is observed with sober understatement: \u201cTargeting hospitals breaks people\u2019s spirits.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hamza plans to do a master\u2019s degree in public health and has ambitions to reform the UN and World Health Organization\u2019s approach to conflict areas: \u201cHe was put under a lot of pressure by the UN, she says, \u201cto evacuate the hospital in a way that was not to the benefit of his patients. He believes the UN was simply implementing what Russia wanted them to do.\u201d</p> <p>The film has now been seen at the UN and, at a recent briefing at the UK mission, with ambassadors in attendance. The issue of the bombing of hospitals (with the film as evidence) has also been raised at a security council meeting. And it is hoped that <em>For Sama</em> will be shown to the Russian government (although Watts is mindful of the risk that the Russian regime might \u201cpirate, re-edit or misrepresent it\u201d). And might not showing it in Russia be dangerous for al-Kateab? \u201cIt would but I don\u2019t care. I could have been killed three years ago.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d4bd44aefa99f833279a80ebc4f2698f202b8c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4bd44aefa99f833279a80ebc4f2698f202b8c4/0_312_5401_3242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Co-director Edward Watts, Waad al-Kateab and her husband Hamza take their message to the Cannes film festival earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Co-director Edward Watts, Waad al-Kateab and her husband Hamza take their message to the Cannes film festival earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From an outsider\u2019s point of view what seems most striking in the film \u2013 bordering on mystifying \u2013 is the intensity of the continuing allegiance to Aleppo itself, the wish, expressed repeatedly, to stay no matter what \u2013 a vote to put Aleppo before life itself. One of the oldest and most beautiful cities in the world has had its medieval architecture destroyed by barrel bombs. Wouldn\u2019t you run from the wreckage if you could? A boy, with quavering bravado, says he would stay in the city even if his family were to leave. A girl \u2013 no more than three \u2013 as she is compelled to depart, says in a startlingly adult tone: \u201cAleppo is gone.\u201d Al-Kateab lets us know: \u201cSaying goodbye is worse than death.\u201d</p> <p>She nods mutely when I ask if the place itself is precious to her. \u201cA journalist visiting Syria can leave any time. I started with Aleppo in my mind and heart.\u201d She speaks eloquently about shared experience in conflict: \u201cThe people I lived with in Aleppo became closer to me than my own parents, sister and brother.\u201d And she makes the point that she and Hamza recognised the necessity of their roles as doctor and journalist.</p> <p>\u201cWe live for the moment we can go back to Syria,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it will never happen while the Assad regime rules. If he goes, in the same way that we smuggled ourselves back to Aleppo [after a visit to Turkey] in the film \u2013 two headstrong people with a seven-month-old child \u2013 we would smuggle ourselves back again.\u201d The memory of their brave return makes her smile. What else can she find, looking back, that is positive?</p> <p>\u201cDeath was close. We knew we could be killed at any moment but lived as if each minute was our last. That\u2019s why there is so much joy in the film. When death is all around you, life is cheap but very important. A lot of people in the UK don\u2019t know the value of life. Or the value of minutes. If you enjoy doing something, do it. If you love someone, tell them as soon as possible because this life could end at any moment.\u201d The world, she continues, is a \u201cvery dark place \u2013 with Brexit here, US policy, Russia \u2013 and you feel nothing will change. But if people keep pushing, things will be changed and there will be justice. And we will keep fighting \u2013 no matter how long it takes.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.forsamafilm.com/\">For Sama is released in cinemas on 13 September and on Channel 4 later in the autumn.

      "bodyText": "The camera focuses on Sama\u2019s face. She is the sweetest baby and looks, at first glance, as though her life might be ordinary. Her eyes are a transitory newborn colour, greyish green, waiting to turn brown. Her gold earrings look over-large in her tiny ears. Sama means sky in Arabic \u2013 a sky, as her mother imagines it, where no bombs fall, with ordinary clouds and sunshine. So far, this is footage that could be the work of any doting parent, but Sama\u2019s mother is journalist Waad al-Kateab and this is her documentary For Sama, filmed during the Syrian war. In the film al-Kateab sings a lullaby that almost lulls us \u2013 if not Sama \u2013 into a false sense of security. Sama is chewing her toe investigatively, as babies do, when a tank shell explodes. It sounds like a nightmare next-door neighbour heaving heavy furniture about and there is a shout: \u201cDownstairs, downstairs, there\u2019s another one coming\u2026\u201d It is the summer of 2016, the beginning of the siege of Aleppo. The camera loses focus, swerves incoherently. Al-Kateab calmly asks someone to \u201ctake Sama\u201d. By now, the shells are deafening. \u201cThis is insane \u2013 we\u2019re getting this every day,\u201d she goes on in her low, musical voice \u2013 her calm as abnormal as her situation (during the siege there were cluster bombs, chlorine gas, barrel bombs and air strikes). There is fire at the end of their corridor and smoke pours in. They live in the hospital that her husband, Hamza, has started from scratch. And now they are moving a baby on life support and Hamza is shouting: \u201cCome on! We need to pump the ventilators by hand.\u201d In the dark, al-Kateab calls out: \u201cWho\u2019s got Sama?\u201d A UN spokesman recently said the world had become \u201cnumb to the carnage\u201d in Syria after more than eight years of war and that even the rising death toll in Idlib \u2013 the country\u2019s last rebel-held stronghold \u2013 was being met by \u201ca collective shrug\u201d. No wonder al-Kateab feared her film \u2013 which starts with the peaceful protests against President Bashar Al-Assad in 2011 and goes on through the Arab spring to the sacking of Aleppo by regime forces in 2016 \u2013 would be greeted with indifference. But the reaction has been unanimous and overwhelming: audiences in every country in which the film has been shown stand and clap (at Cannes in May, they apparently did so for six minutes). Al-Kateab started out as a citizen journalist for Channel 4 news and has already been acclaimed for her harrowing and human series of reports Inside Aleppo (for which she has won an Emmy and the foreign affairs prize at the British journalism awards). But this film, dedicated to her daughter, is more personal. This is a mother\u2019s film in which the normal rhythms of parenthood become disrupted. Al-Kateab worries that nappies and baby formula will run out. Toddlers use a bombed bus as their playground, painting it all the colours of the rainbow (even little Sama is helped to wield a brush) and al-Kateab\u2019s stoical best friend Afraa never loses the twinkle in her eye as she keeps quiet about weevils she finds in the rice. In the unreality of war, the domesticity startles: an ordinary cooking pot looks outlandish. But this is For Sama\u2019s strength: the tender stuff of family life, often ignored in war reporting, is all there. Already garlanded with awards including best documentary at the Cannes and SXSW film festivals and a special jury prize at Hot Docs, For Sama also shows what it is to destroy a family. We see mothers in fierce, tearless overdrive, like figures from Shakespearean tragedy. One mother searching for her son, Mohammad, gives us the film\u2019s most revealing line. On finding his dead body she postpones the evidence of what she sees, crying hysterically: \u201cIt\u2019s Mummy, I\u2019ve got your milk, wake up!\u201d At this moment, she sees al-Kateab filming. What you expect her to say is: \u201cHow dare you?\u201d Instead, she screams at the top of her voice: \u201cFilm this!\u201d \u201cMy lens,\u201d al-Kateab says now, \u201cwas, for her, the world outside. She wanted her grief witnessed.\u201d Last week \u2013 three years later \u2013 a small girl skips along the corridor of a photographic studio in north London, holding the hand of a babysitter. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mama?\u201d she calls out. Sama is about to join her mother and have her picture taken. She does several experimental twirls in her flowery frock and puts on her shoes with satisfaction. The moment comes to comb her hair: Mama must do it. Sama prefers not to stand still. Asked how old she is, she holds up three fingers, eyes shining. She is an enchanting child, extraordinarily animated. Her mother, beautiful and immaculately dressed \u2013 responding to her daughter at every turn \u2013 is still by contrast. Looking at them after having seen the film, one feels a marvelling gratitude that they have survived. It seems bordering on unreal that she and her family have swapped east Aleppo for east London (she is currently employed by Channel 4 News/ITN). The family was compelled to leave Syria on 21 December 2016 (the city\u2019s sixth month under siege). Hamza was recognised \u2013 as manager of the only surviving hospital and responsible for civilian healthcare in east Aleppo\u2019s last besieged quarter \u2013 to be one of the most significant figures in the civilian administration area and it was he who received the phone call from the UN with a message from the Russians to say that if those remaining in Aleppo wanted to survive, they must surrender and go into exile immediately. Al-Kateab asks in the film: \u201cSama, will you remember Aleppo? Will you blame me for staying here? Or blame me for leaving now?\u201d They had never intended to leave. And, in one sense al-Kateab (not her real name, she uses the pseudonym to protect her relatives) has never left: she brought Syria with her to the UK, arriving with a dozen hard drives initially cut down to 300 hours of footage \u2013 which she then spent two years, with fellow director Edward Watts (an independent film-maker who has made more than 20 documentaries), editing into their 95-minute film. Watching her having her picture taken, she seems professional and aloof \u2013 as if elsewhere (as she presumably feels she is). But as she sits down beside me on a small sofa, that changes. Attentive and warm, she pats my arm to emphasise her points. \u201cI filmed everything,\u201d she explains. Selecting material for the film, the challenge was to achieve a balance between \u201cdark and light, life and death\u201d. At first, she had felt adamant that showing the worst was what mattered: her footage was \u201cevidence\u201d. But then, as Watts explains on the phone, they ran an early test screening at Channel 4, for friends and family \u2013 \u201cjust 15 people or so\u201d \u2013 and realised they had \u201cgone too far into the darkness.\u201d Their first cut was in chronological order. It started with hope, descended into despair. This, they realised, did not work. It is hard to imagine more devastating images than those shown in the film, but al-Kateab and Watts insist many were worse \u2013 including \u201ca pile of very young children\u2019s dead bodies\u201d abandoned at a hospital. The audience could not cope and sometimes, during editing, Watts had found himself putting his hand in front of the screen. They had to think again. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the Syrian war and more than 10 million displaced, and while audiences needed to be aware of \u201ccarnage en masse\u201d, this had not to be at the expense of individual dignity. The collaboration between al-Kateab and Watts started uncertainly because they were in different countries: she was in Turkey (where her family spent a year after fleeing Syria), he was in London. She applied for asylum in the UK on the basis that she and Hamza were targets for reprisals by the regime and on the strength of their work for Channel 4 news and in east Aleppo. Her story had received attention in parliament during the 2016 siege and with the backing of Channel 4 News, her case was swiftly processed. Making the film, al-Kateab had been understandably nervous that a foreigner might falsify or appropriate her emotional copyright. But nowadays, she happily declares that, while most collaborators \u201cstart together and end apart\u201d, she and Watts went the opposite way. It was Watts who had the brainwave to make Sama the key to structuring the film and they discovered that, with a flashback format, they could move between dark and light, with Sama as their \u2013 and our \u2013 lifeline. And, by this stage, the film was becoming a love story. It begins with 18-year-old al-Kateab (she is 26 now) about to study economics at Aleppo university. Hamza is a close friend but married to someone else. She describes him as having the gift of making her feel safe with \u201ca constant smile on his face\u201d. One of the few doctors in Aleppo who is also an activist, his smile is to be tested in the years that follow. East Aleppo lacks schools and emergency and medical services \u2013 thus the urgent need for his hospital. We watch him at work: a confidence-inspiring hero \u2013 his makeshift hospital run, extraordinarily impressively, partly on willpower. In the weeks before they leave the country, the hospital (Hamza\u2019s second after the first was destroyed by bombs) performed 890 operations in 20 days and received 6,000 wounded people. One scene shows a massacre in east Aleppo. Al-Kateab films the rows of bodies hauled out of a river \u2013 like a dormitory for the dead. Heads stick out of the tops of blue sleeping bags, awaiting identification. These civilians have been handcuffed, tortured and executed. Their crime? They lived in \u201careas opposed to the regime\u201d. Hamza\u2019s smile has gone but his composure is holding. As corpses are thrown in makeshift shrouds into a mass grave, there is high and defiant singing: \u201cOur dead have gone to paradise.\u201d When Hamza\u2019s wife urges him to flee the country, he chooses Syria over his first marriage. Armed rebels by this point have freed the city but retaliation is intensifying. Al-Kateab\u2019s camera repeatedly shows terrible smoke on the horizon, rising above the city\u2019s brick buildings like grey plumage. She explains that she started filming on a mobile, graduated to a camera and even borrowed a drone from a friend (she had trouble learning to use it but eventually got superb results). Hamza has come up with a rule for the two of them: no crying in hospital. \u201cHe explained that people saw me as powerful because I was filming and believed in the revolution. If they saw me break down, however strong they might be, it would weaken them. And Hamza felt he had to have strength for everyone. He was a leader.\u201d Hospital staff used to tell her: \u201cWe\u2019re very strong because of Hamza \u2013 he is very cool.\u201d But one day, watching an attempt to save a boy\u2019s life, al-Kateab cannot help herself. Hamza ticks her off: \u201cYou can\u2019t cry in here \u2013 get out.\u201d But then he goes after her. It is striking how often in the film people ask one another: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It seems a redundant question, the answer everywhere to be seen. Al-Kateab agrees but explains: \u201cIt\u2019s about care. Even though I might know you have lost your child, it\u2019s my way of asking what\u2019s going on in your heart.\u201d Hamza told her: \u201cDon\u2019t you realise I\u2019m in love with you? Will you marry me?\u201d The film answers his question with footage of their wedding: Hamza in black suit and lilac tie, Waad in a veil with white silk roses in her hair. Confetti falls through the air, as though there might still be room for a fairytale in Aleppo. It is one of the rare times the camera is not in al-Kateab\u2019s hands. They dance to Willie Nelson\u2019s Crazy and Hamza tells her: \u201cThis is the road we\u2019re taking, it is a long road full of danger and fear but freedom waits for us at the end.\u201d The tenderness of the dancing is offset by what is, in a sense, their most dangerous wedding vow: \u201cCome, let\u2019s walk it together.\u201d In the early days, friends would tease: \u201cThey\u2019d say: Waad\u2019s playing with her camera again\u2026\u201d This changed after one of their dearest friends, Gaith \u2013 a nurse \u2013 and his brother Mahmoud were killed in an air raid. \u201cWe had lost Gaith,\u201d says al-Kateab. \u201cWe knew he was never coming back to this Earth but had this incredible footage of him laughing, working, sad\u2026 the life he\u2019d shared was recorded.\u201d Filming was remembering and the people who once mocked now apologised. Sama\u2019s birth is an ordinary \u2013 and extraordinary \u2013 event, discreetly presented. We see her friends with ears pressed to the door of the hospital room, listening out for the baby\u2019s first cry and jumping for joy when they hear it. Al-Kateab is then seen crying, holding Sama in her arms \u2013 and Hamza teasingly tells her to stop upsetting their baby. What was in her mind? \u201cI was crying because this was a room where two of my friends \u2013 Gaith and Omar \u2013 used to work before they were killed. I was thinking: I\u2019ve brought life to this place. I\u2019d been terrified I\u2019d not live to see Sama born. I was terrified about the future but also so happy. I could see Hamza\u2019s and my story in Sama\u2019s face. Yet I missed Gaith and Omar and wished they were alive.\u201d If filming was remembering, it was also, crucially, about resistance. Al-Kateab emphasises new media\u2019s role in the Arab spring: \u201cMobiles became the only way to show the world that we were fighting for our freedom.\u201d Early student protests were peaceful and festive with fireworks and dancing in the streets. But by 2015, the security forces were beating up student protesters. \u201cThey\u2019d turn up and five minutes later, the place would empty. A presenter from the official channel would ask: \u2018Has anything happened here?\u2019 \u2018No, nothing,\u2019 the remaining students would reply.\u201d Al-Kateab\u2019s footage would capsize that lie. Similarly, she would later secure evidence that Assad\u2019s regime was using chemical weapons. Eventually, filming became her way of surviving: \u201cIt gave me a reason to stay in Aleppo. If I was killed, I\u2019d be leaving something important behind.\u201d Not that it gave her distance on what was happening. It was \u201cdoubly harrowing\u201d and \u201cbrought everything closer\u201d. But for many people, the camera represented hope. And while on the subject, I tell her that, strangely, it was the moments of hope in the film that undid me \u2013 all the more moving for being unexpected. A woman who is nine months pregnant is carried into hospital unconscious. An emergency caesarean is performed. We see the baby pulled out \u2013 lifeless. The misery of it is sickening. War has killed him. Capable gloved hands palpitate the little chest to start the lungs \u2013 surely in vain. The nurse briskly brushes his body with a sweeping movement. They hold him upside down and shake and slap and, just as we have given up on his slippery, grey body, he opens his eyes and cries \u2013 and everyone who sees it will join in. God be praised! His furious frown is a triumph, his cry defies Assad (they save the mother as well). \u201cIt is a miracle,\u201d al-Kateab exclaims. \u201cIt gives us the strength to stay in the struggle.\u201d But for her, too, hope is hardest to handle: \u201cWhenever I watch the film, it is when everyone else is laughing that I cry. We were creating hope and it was destroyed by the violence of the regime and by the Russians. At the last screening, sitting next to Ed, I started crying as I watched the early days of the revolution. And he was asking me: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d And I said: \u201cIt\u2019s the hope.\u201d But there has been another, more manageable, version of hope too \u2013 in people\u2019s reactions to the film: \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing \u2013 audiences have given me hope, shown me they really care. I\u2019ve been to Nantucket, Washington, Toronto, and even film distributors, who normally sample a film for 10 minutes and then leave, have stayed and been very moved.\u201d When people went \u201ccrazy\u201d in Cannes, she says, \u201cI can\u2019t describe how proud and happy it made me.\u201d It will be years before Sama is old enough to see the film made in her name. Al-Kateab addresses her in the film like this: \u201cSama, I know you understand what is happening. I can see it in your eyes. You never cry like a normal baby would. That\u2019s what breaks my heart.\u201d Now she confirms that, on some level, \u201cSama understood everything. That time I was looking for her during the bombing, I found her sleeping in a very quiet way\u201d. Her second daughter, Taima (she became pregnant again while still in Aleppo, the baby was born in Turkey) reacts in a \u201ctotally different way. If a bottle of milk drops, she cries. Sama used to fall from a high bed and not make a sound. But I\u2019d sometimes sense she was scared.\u201d After leaving Syria, Sama used to wake in the night screaming. They consulted experts \u2013 she is doing better now. Better than her mother, who says: \u201cI still suffer from nightmares. And whenever I hear a very loud sound \u2013 like a train \u2013 I feel it in my body. I tried to seek therapy but it did not work for me.\u201d She has said in the past that her therapist (whom she now wants me to know is \u201camazing\u201d and says she \u201cloves\u201d) herself needed therapy after their sessions together. The film\u2019s most extraordinary achievement is that, instead of leaving one helpless, it creates resolve. Everyone who sees it feels the same. Al-Kateab says audiences come to her moved and energised and with one question: what can we do? The first step is \u201cunderstanding\u201d, she says \u2013 especially at a point where Idlib\u2019s suffering is starting to resemble Aleppo\u2019s. And she gets out her phone to play the infamous September 2016 interview with US presidential candidate Gary Johnson. Asked about his plans for Aleppo, he replies gormlessly: \u201cWhat\u2019s Aleppo?\u201d It was this interview that stung Al-Kateab into making the banner seven-month-old Sama holds at the end of the film with their city of ash as a backdrop. It reads: THIS IS ALEPPO. WHAT\u2019S JUSTICE? As well as the need for understanding, she hopes for support for the campaign she and Hamza plan to launch next month on forsamafilm.com, to \u201cstop bombing hospitals\u201d. She argues that the bombing of hospitals is now a \u201cworldwide\u201d problem. When Hamza\u2019s hospital is bombed, it is observed with sober understatement: \u201cTargeting hospitals breaks people\u2019s spirits.\u201d Meanwhile, Hamza plans to do a master\u2019s degree in public health and has ambitions to reform the UN and World Health Organization\u2019s approach to conflict areas: \u201cHe was put under a lot of pressure by the UN, she says, \u201cto evacuate the hospital in a way that was not to the benefit of his patients. He believes the UN was simply implementing what Russia wanted them to do.\u201d The film has now been seen at the UN and, at a recent briefing at the UK mission, with ambassadors in attendance. The issue of the bombing of hospitals (with the film as evidence) has also been raised at a security council meeting. And it is hoped that For Sama will be shown to the Russian government (although Watts is mindful of the risk that the Russian regime might \u201cpirate, re-edit or misrepresent it\u201d). And might not showing it in Russia be dangerous for al-Kateab? \u201cIt would but I don\u2019t care. I could have been killed three years ago.\u201d From an outsider\u2019s point of view what seems most striking in the film \u2013 bordering on mystifying \u2013 is the intensity of the continuing allegiance to Aleppo itself, the wish, expressed repeatedly, to stay no matter what \u2013 a vote to put Aleppo before life itself. One of the oldest and most beautiful cities in the world has had its medieval architecture destroyed by barrel bombs. Wouldn\u2019t you run from the wreckage if you could? A boy, with quavering bravado, says he would stay in the city even if his family were to leave. A girl \u2013 no more than three \u2013 as she is compelled to depart, says in a startlingly adult tone: \u201cAleppo is gone.\u201d Al-Kateab lets us know: \u201cSaying goodbye is worse than death.\u201d She nods mutely when I ask if the place itself is precious to her. \u201cA journalist visiting Syria can leave any time. I started with Aleppo in my mind and heart.\u201d She speaks eloquently about shared experience in conflict: \u201cThe people I lived with in Aleppo became closer to me than my own parents, sister and brother.\u201d And she makes the point that she and Hamza recognised the necessity of their roles as doctor and journalist. \u201cWe live for the moment we can go back to Syria,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it will never happen while the Assad regime rules. If he goes, in the same way that we smuggled ourselves back to Aleppo [after a visit to Turkey] in the film \u2013 two headstrong people with a seven-month-old child \u2013 we would smuggle ourselves back again.\u201d The memory of their brave return makes her smile. What else can she find, looking back, that is positive? \u201cDeath was close. We knew we could be killed at any moment but lived as if each minute was our last. That\u2019s why there is so much joy in the film. When death is all around you, life is cheap but very important. A lot of people in the UK don\u2019t know the value of life. Or the value of minutes. If you enjoy doing something, do it. If you love someone, tell them as soon as possible because this life could end at any moment.\u201d The world, she continues, is a \u201cvery dark place \u2013 with Brexit here, US policy, Russia \u2013 and you feel nothing will change. But if people keep pushing, things will be changed and there will be justice. And we will keep fighting \u2013 no matter how long it takes.\u201d For Sama is released in cinemas on 13 September and on Channel 4 later in the autumn. Preview screenings including Q&amp;A sessions with the film-makers are also happening nationwide",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019d just made an offhand comment in the pub, when I saw it. Nigel did an actual eye roll. And it was a good one. I\u2019d barely met Nigel, a friend of a friend, so don\u2019t know what he does for a living, but the guy could be at the Emoji Academy of Facial Acting. If they ever made a film about, say, a CGI panda who reads <em>The Spectator</em> \u2013 and Andy Serkis wasn\u2019t available \u2013 they\u2019d hire Nigel to do the motion capture.</p> <p>The 4G in the pub was bad, so in the absence of Twitter I\u2019d made the mistake of being too vocal about something with a real-life stranger. I\u2019d just noted that my son has many clothes featuring cars, trucks and dinosaurs and my nieces\u2019 options were all flowers and fairies. I wasn\u2019t being judgmental about it, but Nigel \u2013 a friendly, chatty dad, but the type you could imagine attending a taping of <em>Top Gear</em><em> </em>\u2013 knew I wrote a column for the <em>Observer</em> and probably presumed I\u2019d come straight to the pub from a dolphin s\u00e9ance. His anti-PC alarms all started ringing.</p> <p>\u2018Surnames,\u2019 I said to Nigel. \u2018If I said to you: \u201cJust last week, Doherty and McLaughlin went to the funfair,\u201d you\u2019d imagine two blokes, wouldn\u2019t you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Not sure.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You would \u2013 because unless otherwise indicated, surnames denote men, even though last time I checked all women have a surname. And it\u2019s not like going to the funfair is gendered. Even if you change it to \u201cDoherty and McLaughlin went for mojitos,\u201d I still think of two blokes. Because we\u2019re the default, Nigel. You have to add a qualifier for a woman to even be connected to the surname she lives her whole life with.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019ve thought about this a lot.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well, yeah, because, putting aside the rights and wrongs, I\u2019m just confused. I mean, what are the rules? With toddler clothes, I kinda get fairies and princesses being for girls because fairies and princesses are girls. But why are so many neutral things for boys? I mean, all sexes drive cars, and they\u2019re a boy thing, too. More men throughout history have caught butterflies and studied flowers than women, so why are those girly? Is it because they\u2019re colourful? Then why are rainbows unisex? Why are dogs and cats unisex, while dinosaurs, big or small, carnivores or herbivores, always coded as boyish? I just don\u2019t get it.\u2019</p> <p>Nigel sipped his drink then said, \u2018What about Cher and Madonna?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Excuse me?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You said all women have surnames. What about Cher and Madonna?\u2019</p> <p>He had me there. Since it\u2019s best to quit while you\u2019re ahead in the offline world, we shook on the fact that gendered clothing was weird, and some women don\u2019t have surnames. Just then our mutual friend returned to ask why I\u2019d been ranting at Nigel for five minutes. \u2018Well, you know,\u2019 I said, as if it was obvious. \u2018Twitter was down.\u2019 </p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019d just made an offhand comment in the pub, when I saw it. Nigel did an actual eye roll. And it was a good one. I\u2019d barely met Nigel, a friend of a friend, so don\u2019t know what he does for a living, but the guy could be at the Emoji Academy of Facial Acting. If they ever made a film about, say, a CGI panda who reads The Spectator \u2013 and Andy Serkis wasn\u2019t available \u2013 they\u2019d hire Nigel to do the motion capture. The 4G in the pub was bad, so in the absence of Twitter I\u2019d made the mistake of being too vocal about something with a real-life stranger. I\u2019d just noted that my son has many clothes featuring cars, trucks and dinosaurs and my nieces\u2019 options were all flowers and fairies. I wasn\u2019t being judgmental about it, but Nigel \u2013 a friendly, chatty dad, but the type you could imagine attending a taping of Top Gear \u2013 knew I wrote a column for the Observer and probably presumed I\u2019d come straight to the pub from a dolphin s\u00e9ance. His anti-PC alarms all started ringing. \u2018Surnames,\u2019 I said to Nigel. \u2018If I said to you: \u201cJust last week, Doherty and McLaughlin went to the funfair,\u201d you\u2019d imagine two blokes, wouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Not sure.\u2019 \u2018You would \u2013 because unless otherwise indicated, surnames denote men, even though last time I checked all women have a surname. And it\u2019s not like going to the funfair is gendered. Even if you change it to \u201cDoherty and McLaughlin went for mojitos,\u201d I still think of two blokes. Because we\u2019re the default, Nigel. You have to add a qualifier for a woman to even be connected to the surname she lives her whole life with.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve thought about this a lot.\u2019 \u2018Well, yeah, because, putting aside the rights and wrongs, I\u2019m just confused. I mean, what are the rules? With toddler clothes, I kinda get fairies and princesses being for girls because fairies and princesses are girls. But why are so many neutral things for boys? I mean, all sexes drive cars, and they\u2019re a boy thing, too. More men throughout history have caught butterflies and studied flowers than women, so why are those girly? Is it because they\u2019re colourful? Then why are rainbows unisex? Why are dogs and cats unisex, while dinosaurs, big or small, carnivores or herbivores, always coded as boyish? I just don\u2019t get it.\u2019 Nigel sipped his drink then said, \u2018What about Cher and Madonna?\u2019 \u2018Excuse me?\u2019 \u2018You said all women have surnames. What about Cher and Madonna?\u2019 He had me there. Since it\u2019s best to quit while you\u2019re ahead in the offline world, we shook on the fact that gendered clothing was weird, and some women don\u2019t have surnames. Just then our mutual friend returned to ask why I\u2019d been ranting at Nigel for five minutes. \u2018Well, you know,\u2019 I said, as if it was obvious. \u2018Twitter was down.\u2019 Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

      "body": "<p><strong>Fans of </strong>William Blake will be flocking to Tate Britain from early September for an exhibition of the poet and artist. Many will know that Blake lived from 1800\u201103 in a cottage in Felpham, West Sussex, where he wrote And did those feet in ancient time, later set to music as Jerusalem by Hubert Parry and, of course, a Last Night of the Proms regular.</p> <p>There were high hopes for the cottage after it was bought from a local family in 2015 for \u00a3500,000 by a newly established Blake Cottage Trust. The bulk of the purchase money came from a fund set up in the will of a multimillionaire, who made his fortune from concrete.

      "bodyText": "Fans of William Blake will be flocking to Tate Britain from early September for an exhibition of the poet and artist. Many will know that Blake lived from 1800\u201103 in a cottage in Felpham, West Sussex, where he wrote And did those feet in ancient time, later set to music as Jerusalem by Hubert Parry and, of course, a Last Night of the Proms regular. There were high hopes for the cottage after it was bought from a local family in 2015 for \u00a3500,000 by a newly established Blake Cottage Trust. The bulk of the purchase money came from a fund set up in the will of a multimillionaire, who made his fortune from concrete. But four years on, the house, which is Grade II* listed, is in a state of neglect, with its thatched roof and rafters needing urgent repairs. A grandiose scheme for a major renovation has so far come to naught. The trust, chaired by Tim Heath who also chairs the Blake Society, submitted plans 18 months ago by architects MICA for the original home to be restored and a 1950s extension demolished to make way for a stylish new building.

      "bodyText": "Student Liberty Sprackling paid the London Congestion Charge online before driving into the capital. The \u00a311.50 fee, levied during peak hours on weekdays, was debited from her account. Eight days later, it was mysteriously refunded. Sprackling contacted Transport for London (TfL), the government body responsible for the charge, and was told she would have to wait until she had received a penalty charge notice (PCN) for non-payment and then contest it. She did so and, despite sending confirmation of the transaction provided by her bank, her challenge was turned down and she was ordered to pay an \u00a380 fine, rising to the full \u00a3160 if not settled within 14 days. On the same day she made the payment, the Observer reported the case of another reader, Mahdi Koutizadeh, who also transferred the \u00a311.50 online before driving into the congestion zone. The transaction showed as pending on his account for five days, then vanished. He, too, was told that he must await a PCN then challenge it. He sent a screenshot of the pending sum but TfL declared that he had not provided \u201csufficient evidence\u201d of payment and fined him.

      "body": "<p>In May 2017, I watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/edna-o-brien\" title=\"\">Edna O\u2019Brien</a> read from a work-in-progress before a predominantly young audience at a publishing event in London. As the veteran Irish novelist arranged herself at a small table lit by a single lamp, I wondered how many of those present were aware of her literary lineage or even knew who she was. She waited for silence to settle before speaking \u2013 quietly at first, but with an intensity of purpose that belied her advancing years. \u201cI was a girl once,\u201d she began, \u201cbut not any more.\u201d</p> <p>I can still recall the rapt silence that attended her every word and hung in the air for a long moment after her reading ended. Then came the applause, heartfelt and sustained. It was an exercise in almost primal storytelling: stark, dramatic and pitch-perfect in its execution. A lesson from a master.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien\u2019s new novel, <em>Girl</em>, opens with that same haunting sentence, matter of fact and regretful. What follows is a contemporary story as raw and transfixing as the most visceral Greek tragedy, a story of abduction, rape and imprisonment recounted in often unflinching detail by Maryam, the young Nigerian girl of the title. It is, as the American novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/richard-ford\" title=\"\">Richard Ford</a> attests, a work \u201cof profound empathy and grace\u201d, its narrative leavened by deftly wrought moments of maternal intimacy that possess a quiet but almost luminous intensity.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien is 88. <em>Girl</em> is her 19th novel and she has intimated that it may be her last. It may yet prove to be her most powerful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel almost mortified, because the girls I have written about are not on a knife edge \u2013 they are in hell</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idea for the novel came from a newspaper report about a girl who was found wandering in Sambisa Forest in Nigeria. \u201cEvery day the newspapers are full of novels waiting to be written, but this small item resonated in my inner mind,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe girl had escaped her captors, but she had lost her mind and she was carrying a baby. I could not have written this novel if the violence and injustice done to this young woman and many others hadn\u2019t been moulded on to my self and my soul.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 and 2017, O\u2019Brien made two trips to Nigeria, where she met several young women who had escaped captivity, having been among the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/the-night-boko-haram-kidnapped-our-girls-a-chibok-resident-remembers\" title=\"\"> 276 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram</a> jihadists in the Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014. \u201cYou hear these terrible stories and you absorb them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey haunt me still. I wake sometimes thinking of the girls and the horrors they experienced.\u201d</p> <p><em>Girl</em> is unlike any of the novels that preceded it in O\u2019Brien\u2019s 60-year career, the style spare and restrained, the terrain unfamiliar, a world away from the landscape and discontents of her native Ireland. \u201cIt was new territory for me, emotionally, geographically, culturally,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to discard the things that have fortified my writing for 60 years \u2013 landscape, lyricism, love. I had to put all those things aside and just dive in as if this was the first book I had ever written.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9729538ce0491f7b66ba2d241d8b0f507836978e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9729538ce0491f7b66ba2d241d8b0f507836978e/44_786_3242_1945/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edna O\u2019Brien in the street where she lived in 1964\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edna O\u2019Brien in the street where she lived in 1964. Photograph: Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I meet O\u2019Brien at her modest terraced house on a quiet, well-to-do street in Chelsea. In older age, she remains glamorous, dressed today in a pleated top and three-quarter length skirt. Her eyes are alert and alive, especially when she laughs, but she is very pale and very thin.</p> <p>\u201cI have not been in great health this past year,\u201d she says, when I ask her how she is doing. \u201cI want and hope to get better. Right now, I am conserving my energy for the things that are most important to me, and writing is very high on that list.\u201d</p> <p>She makes tea in her homely ground-floor kitchen, handing me the cups and ushering me up the stairs ahead of her while she follows slowly and tentatively, pausing for breath at the turn of the stairs. We settle in the first-floor living room, which is also a work space. The wall behind her is lined floor to ceiling with books, including several novels by the mostly male big-hitters she admires: Roth, Pinter, Beckett, Joyce \u2013 the first three of whom she befriended, the fourth whom she admires more than any other writer.</p> <p>It is unmistakably a writer\u2019s room, a retreat of sorts, but also a place of hard graft. A desk in the corner by the fireplace is cluttered with manuscripts and writing pads. While researching <em>Girl</em>, she tells me, she amassed four boxes of notebooks and 16 boxes of research material. She picks up an early draft of the novel from the low table between us. \u201cI\u2019m a perfectionist,\u201d she says, opening it at a page decorated with handwritten notes and corrections. \u201cI work so hard to get things right, changing lines and words right up to the end. It\u2019s exhausting, but absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Her editor, Lee Brackstone, who has recently departed Faber, describes her as \u201can artist who adheres to the now old-fashioned belief that it should be difficult by necessity to make great work\u201d. It is, he adds, \u201calmost masochistic with Edna: if she\u2019s feeling the pain, she\u2019s making the art. That inevitably takes its toll.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her if this novel was more exhausting than the others. She nods. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound self-pitying about it, but it was the hardest and the most painful. I\u2019m not exactly in the prime of youth. There was a point where I was faced with a long table filled with pages and pages of writing, hundreds of pages. You ask yourself, \u2018What am I doing? Why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d Has she found a satisfactory answer? \u201cIt\u2019s what I chose to do,\u201d she replies without hesitation, \u201cbut, more than that, it\u2019s my life. Writing is my breathing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b06714c25d4bd136fff4cdcba65e6d6e2d2f007e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b06714c25d4bd136fff4cdcba65e6d6e2d2f007e/742_0_2667_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grace Molony and Genevieve Hulme-Beaman in Chichester festival theatre\u2019s 2017 production of Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Country Girls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grace Molony and Genevieve Hulme-Beaman in Chichester festival theatre\u2019s 2017 production of Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Country Girls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a recent BBC documentary, she described her state of mind on departing for Nigeria as \u201cfearful and fearless\u201d. She also confessed to having smuggled \u00a315,000 into the country, wads of cash concealed in her sleeves and her underwear. \u201cI worked out that I would need roughly that much to give to people who could help me to arrange things. And, sure enough, it all got spent.\u201d</p> <p>There, she met and interviewed doctors, aid workers, a trauma specialist and local journalists. She undertook often arduous journeys overland to visit camps for displaced persons, some of whom followed her around, pleading to be rescued. At one point, she stayed in a convent, which, she says laughing, \u201cis one place I never expected to be\u201d. And, through her contacts, she met the girls \u2013 Rebecca, Abigail, Hope, Patience, Fatime, Amina and Hadya \u2013 whose survivor\u2019s stories she absorbed and then transformed into the novel\u2019s single, soul-searing narrative.</p> <p>\u201cThey each spoke to me in a similar way,\u201d she tells me, \u201cwhich was understated, reserved, guarded. They are so young and shy and protective of their modesty, even after all that has happened to them, the brutal horror of what they went through. There is shame, too, alas. It was heartbreaking and I found myself crying a lot.\u201d</p> <p>All of this, I venture, would have been physically and emotionally demanding for a much younger writer, never mind one in her late 80s. She nods and falls silent for a time. \u201cIt still is emotionally demanding, even to think about it. It was not just a new country for me, but a new everything. I thought I was in the Tower of Babel when I arrived in Abuja airport\u2026 the noise, the chaos. There were times when it felt like I was on a constant knife edge. And, as I say this, I feel almost mortified, because the girls I have written about are not on a knife edge, they are in hell. Their trauma continues and will stay with them for ever. At least I was able to come home.\u201d</p> <p>If <em>Girl</em> was written out of a mixture of fierce anger and deep empathy, it was also, one suspects, driven by a keen awareness of O\u2019Brien\u2019s own encroaching mortality. Is it something she finds herself dwelling on? \u201cWell, I\u2019m aware of it\u2026 I\u2019d have to be, wouldn\u2019t I?

The novels articulated what, until then, had remained relatively unspoken in staunchly Catholic Ireland: female sexual desire, active and acted upon. It was expressed gleefully by her young female protagonists, whose determination to enjoy themselves was, in itself, an instinctive act of rebellion against parochialism and patriarchy. The authorities responded by banning her books, the clergy by denouncing her from the pulpit. In her home town of Tuamgraney, County Clare, which she recently described as \u201cnot a town at all, but a hill with some pubs\u201d, the local postmistress told her mother that, should her daughter dare to return, she \u201cshould be kicked naked through the streets\u201d.</p> <p>Those early novels had other less seismic, but more abiding, reverberations. \u201cLooking at <em>The Country Girls</em> now, it is not so shocking,\u201d says Irish novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-enright\" title=\"\">Anne Enright</a>, \u201cbut what endures is the way she portrays the friendship between the two girls. When I first read it at 16, what really chimed with me was their adventurousness, their defiant spirit. Female friendship had not been written about in that way in an Irish context until she came along.\u201d</p> <p>The raw material for her early books was her own young life, which, as described in her wonderfully evocative 2012 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/edna-obrien-country-girl-review\" title=\"\"><em>Country Girl</em></a>, was both fearful and transportive. She was raised in a once-grand house, the youngest child of a beleaguered mother and a sometimes tyrannical father. \u201cHe was too fond of the drink,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut sadly for us, he was one of those unfortunate men who the drink did not agree with.\u201d She grew up in fear of his rages, often retreating as a child to the surrounding fields to daydream and to write imaginary stories in which, she recalled later, \u201cthe words ran away with me\u201d.</p> <p>As she got older, she became her mother\u2019s protector, her loyalty repaid by a fierce maternal love that turned to a suffocating possessiveness. When she rebelled, it was with a defiance that shocked the family and made her the talk of the parish. Having been sent to Dublin to train as a pharmacist, she met and fell for an older man, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_G%C3%A9bler\" title=\"\">Ernest G\u00e9bler</a>, an Irish writer of Czech-Jewish origin. She was 22 and he was 38, darkly handsome, divorced and the father of a young son. He was also an aspiring author, with a house in the country, a library and a classical music collection. \u201cThis was culture!\u201d she told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-yentob\" title=\"\">Alan Yentob</a> recently. \u201cThis was real culture!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7200a47af736ff4d230266d2f07cc9edd0da53f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7200a47af736ff4d230266d2f07cc9edd0da53f/0_0_3072_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Caine in Zee And Co, the 1972 film based on O\u2019Brien\u2019s novel of the same name.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Caine in Zee And Co, the 1972 film based on O\u2019Brien\u2019s novel of the same name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1958, in the hope of furthering his writing career, G\u00e9bler relocated the family to London, where O\u2019Brien found herself marooned in the drab outer suburbs of London with their two young children. It was there, in the hours between dropping off Carlo and Sasha at school and picking them up again, that she began writing, in a burst of feverish creativity. \u201cThe words poured out on to the page,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the first and only time that happened.\u201d In <em>Country Girl</em>, she remembers writing in floods of tears, but \u201cthey were good tears. They touched on feelings I did not know I had.\u201d They were feelings that at least one generation of young Irish women connected with deeply. As novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/eimear-mcbride\" title=\"\">Eimear McBride</a> later put it: \u201c<em>The Country Girls</em> is not the novel that broke the mould, it is the one that made it\u2026 O\u2019Brien gave voice to a previously muzzled generation of Irish women.\u201d</p> <p>Her suddenly unleashed creativity unwittingly incensed G\u00e9bler, who appeared at breakfast one morning with a manuscript copy of the novel in his hand. He told her: \u201cYou can write and I will never forgive you.\u201d Their marriage was dissolved in 1964 and, against the odds, O\u2019Brien was granted custody of the children after a three-year legal battle in which supposedly scandalous passages from her fourth novel, <em>August </em><em>Is </em><em>a Wicked Month</em>, were used as evidence of her wayward character.</p> <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, when she was famous and fashionably scandalous, her regular house parties in Chelsea drew the likes of Marlon Brando, Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum to her door. (According to her memoir, she succumbed only to the latter\u2019s advances: \u201cWe danced all the way up to the bedroom... with all the shyness of besotted strangers in syrupy songs.\u201d) For all that, though, she never remarried. I ask her if the trauma of that first, ill-fated union had hardened her against tying the knot again. She nods. \u201cI suppose I was always hooked on this idea of love, by which I mean deep love. I didn\u2019t have one-night flings, I just didn\u2019t. Not out of morality, but more my own conviction that love is so serious. Of course, it\u2019s carnal and it\u2019s many other things, but it\u2019s such a unity. I suppose I got that from my religion very early on.\u201d</p> <p>So, for her, love is an almost sacred ideal?</p> <p>\u201cSacred \u2013 with profanity,\u201d she replies, laughing.</p> <p>It was that other great Irish romantic, WB Yeats, who described the creative life as a process of continuous self-reinvention \u2013 \u201cMyself must I remake.\u201d As her run of late novels attests, O\u2019Brien seems to be living by that dictum. Where once she wrote about the interior lives of her female protagonists, since the mid-1990s she has looked outwards for her subject matter, at the state of things, politically and culturally. It was a typically bold move that followed a fallow period when her high lyrical style felt out of fashion with reviewers and audiences alike.</p> <p>\u201cLiterature is a volatile business,\u201d says her son, Carlo. \u201cYou are dependent on your latest success. When the critical tide turned against her, she shifted her voice. It became less lyrical, but there was absolute fidelity to clarity, lucidity and directness. It is those virtues that are at the centre of her literary practice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82a35007deee3df777b8b8ff451fd36b6dfcad9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82a35007deee3df777b8b8ff451fd36b6dfcad9c/170_0_2617_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2014 protest demanding the release of the girls abducted from Chibok by Boko Haram.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2014 protest demanding the release of the girls abducted from Chibok by Boko Haram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shift occurred, O\u2019Brien tells me, \u201cas my conscience and my consciousness opened out a bit to what was happening around me.\u201d The first evidence of this change in style and subject matter came with 1994\u2019s <em>The House of Splendid Isolation</em>, the first of what might be called her state-of-the-nation novels. It remains an interestingly flawed book, almost postmodern in its fragmented narrative style, but the stylistic experimentation was all but overlooked in scathing reviews that took issue with her too-sympathetic portrayal of an Irish Republican gunman.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone in the <em>Spectator</em> said I did not deserve the gifts I had been given,\u201d she says, still sounding mortally offended. Though her writing had, as she puts it, \u201cdeepened and darkened\u201d, she was doing what she had always done: writing against the received wisdoms that prevailed in her homeland.</p> <p>\u201cIn the south of Ireland, what you heard most often was that there was a war going on up there in the north and that they were all as bad as each other. I felt that was both untrue on the ground and untrue to history, to what will be written and said 50 years from now.\u201d</p> <p>Controversy also stalked her 2002 novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/04/fiction.reviews1\" title=\"\"><em>In the Forest</em></a>, which drew on a real tragedy that had transfixed Ireland eight years before: the triple murder of a mother, child and priest by a mentally disturbed man. The pre-eminent Irish critic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fintan-o-toole\" title=\"\">Fintan O\u2019Toole</a>, described it as \u201ca novel too far\u201d, later writing that \u201cthere is simply no artistic need for so close an intrusion into other people\u2019s grief\u201d. When I broach that criticism now, she takes a deep breath and says: \u201cIf Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez or other writers write those sort of stories, they are not attacked in their own country for it; but I am and I always have been attacked. I partly think it\u2019s to do with being a woman\u2026 and with the assumption that I approach themes that I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Brien remains an indomitable presence, the defiance and determination that drove her younger self still apparent despite her physical fragility. A few weeks after we speak, she sends me an email suggesting she is aware that, at 88, she may still provoke controversy with the publication of <em>Girl</em>.</p> <p>The email reads: \u201cIt has been suggested to me that as an outsider I am not eligible to write this story. I do not subscribe to that devious form of censorship. Theme and territory belong to all who aspire to tell it and the only criteria [sic] is the gravity in the telling. I was haunted by the plight of girls in north-east Nigeria, Chibok and others, thrust into servitude, their childhoods stolen, the leeching of hope day by day. I marvel at their magnificent fortitude. The world is crying out for such stories to be told and I intend to explore them while there is a writing bone left in my body.\u201d</p> <p>Her life, though, like her work, has become pared down. \u201cI\u2019m no longer a habitue of the social whirl,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cBut I love real conversations, whether with a shepherd or Schopenhauer, I don\u2019t care. So long as one is lifted from one\u2019s own stew to other things \u2013 and learning, always learning.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f88340d30ffc90aa11cf6d8ab2a6feeb40019034\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f88340d30ffc90aa11cf6d8ab2a6feeb40019034/142_421_4769_2861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her son Sasha G\u00e9bler at Cecconi\u2019s restaurant in Mayfair, London, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her son Sasha G\u00e9bler at Cecconi\u2019s restaurant in Mayfair, London, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Brownlee/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When she\u2019s not writing, she says to my surprise, she watches football: \u201cI love football, all football.\u201d Of late, too, she has been transfixed by the HBO series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/12/chernobyl-review-jared-harris-emily-watson-line-of-duty-sex-on-trial\" title=\"\"><em>Chernobyl</em></a>: \u201cIt was so meticulously plotted I kept thinking of the opening chapters of <em>War </em><em>and Peace</em>.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her if, despite her run-ins with the Irish clergy, she is spiritually inclined. \u201cI think so, yes.

But, when faced with the horror we see on the nightly news, any sane person would wonder, where is God in this scenario? So I am very puzzled and divided by God.

It is situated on a holy island on the River Shannon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s family grave, but, ironically, she herself is not buried there, because she wanted her grave to be in a village where people passing by would say a prayer for her. Whereas I want the birds, and the old monasteries that are ruined, and the lake and just the song of nature.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her if she has any regrets. \u201cNo, not really. I have been a bit foolish in my life,\u201d she says, chuckling, \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a deep thinker, but I\u2019ve been foolish with money, foolish in love. But, regrets are a waste of time. One moves on. One has to. In the moment, I am capable of real anger, because I am a passionate and furious creature as well as being a rather tender one.

Though she suggested recently that <em>Girl</em> would be her final novel, she tells me there may be another, but that it exists at present \u201conly on the nascent horizon\u201d.

      "bodyText": "In May 2017, I watched Edna O\u2019Brien read from a work-in-progress before a predominantly young audience at a publishing event in London. As the veteran Irish novelist arranged herself at a small table lit by a single lamp, I wondered how many of those present were aware of her literary lineage or even knew who she was. She waited for silence to settle before speaking \u2013 quietly at first, but with an intensity of purpose that belied her advancing years. \u201cI was a girl once,\u201d she began, \u201cbut not any more.\u201d I can still recall the rapt silence that attended her every word and hung in the air for a long moment after her reading ended. Then came the applause, heartfelt and sustained. It was an exercise in almost primal storytelling: stark, dramatic and pitch-perfect in its execution. A lesson from a master. O\u2019Brien\u2019s new novel, Girl, opens with that same haunting sentence, matter of fact and regretful. What follows is a contemporary story as raw and transfixing as the most visceral Greek tragedy, a story of abduction, rape and imprisonment recounted in often unflinching detail by Maryam, the young Nigerian girl of the title. It is, as the American novelist Richard Ford attests, a work \u201cof profound empathy and grace\u201d, its narrative leavened by deftly wrought moments of maternal intimacy that possess a quiet but almost luminous intensity. O\u2019Brien is 88. Girl is her 19th novel and she has intimated that it may be her last. It may yet prove to be her most powerful. The idea for the novel came from a newspaper report about a girl who was found wandering in Sambisa Forest in Nigeria. \u201cEvery day the newspapers are full of novels waiting to be written, but this small item resonated in my inner mind,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe girl had escaped her captors, but she had lost her mind and she was carrying a baby. I could not have written this novel if the violence and injustice done to this young woman and many others hadn\u2019t been moulded on to my self and my soul.\u201d In 2016 and 2017, O\u2019Brien made two trips to Nigeria, where she met several young women who had escaped captivity, having been among the 276 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram jihadists in the Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014. \u201cYou hear these terrible stories and you absorb them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey haunt me still. I wake sometimes thinking of the girls and the horrors they experienced.\u201d Girl is unlike any of the novels that preceded it in O\u2019Brien\u2019s 60-year career, the style spare and restrained, the terrain unfamiliar, a world away from the landscape and discontents of her native Ireland. \u201cIt was new territory for me, emotionally, geographically, culturally,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to discard the things that have fortified my writing for 60 years \u2013 landscape, lyricism, love. I had to put all those things aside and just dive in as if this was the first book I had ever written.\u201d I meet O\u2019Brien at her modest terraced house on a quiet, well-to-do street in Chelsea. In older age, she remains glamorous, dressed today in a pleated top and three-quarter length skirt. Her eyes are alert and alive, especially when she laughs, but she is very pale and very thin. \u201cI have not been in great health this past year,\u201d she says, when I ask her how she is doing. \u201cI want and hope to get better. Right now, I am conserving my energy for the things that are most important to me, and writing is very high on that list.\u201d She makes tea in her homely ground-floor kitchen, handing me the cups and ushering me up the stairs ahead of her while she follows slowly and tentatively, pausing for breath at the turn of the stairs. We settle in the first-floor living room, which is also a work space. The wall behind her is lined floor to ceiling with books, including several novels by the mostly male big-hitters she admires: Roth, Pinter, Beckett, Joyce \u2013 the first three of whom she befriended, the fourth whom she admires more than any other writer. It is unmistakably a writer\u2019s room, a retreat of sorts, but also a place of hard graft. A desk in the corner by the fireplace is cluttered with manuscripts and writing pads. While researching Girl, she tells me, she amassed four boxes of notebooks and 16 boxes of research material. She picks up an early draft of the novel from the low table between us. \u201cI\u2019m a perfectionist,\u201d she says, opening it at a page decorated with handwritten notes and corrections. \u201cI work so hard to get things right, changing lines and words right up to the end. It\u2019s exhausting, but absolutely necessary.\u201d Her editor, Lee Brackstone, who has recently departed Faber, describes her as \u201can artist who adheres to the now old-fashioned belief that it should be difficult by necessity to make great work\u201d. It is, he adds, \u201calmost masochistic with Edna: if she\u2019s feeling the pain, she\u2019s making the art. That inevitably takes its toll.\u201d I ask her if this novel was more exhausting than the others. She nods. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound self-pitying about it, but it was the hardest and the most painful. I\u2019m not exactly in the prime of youth. There was a point where I was faced with a long table filled with pages and pages of writing, hundreds of pages. You ask yourself, \u2018What am I doing? Why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d Has she found a satisfactory answer? \u201cIt\u2019s what I chose to do,\u201d she replies without hesitation, \u201cbut, more than that, it\u2019s my life. Writing is my breathing.\u201d In a recent BBC documentary, she described her state of mind on departing for Nigeria as \u201cfearful and fearless\u201d. She also confessed to having smuggled \u00a315,000 into the country, wads of cash concealed in her sleeves and her underwear. \u201cI worked out that I would need roughly that much to give to people who could help me to arrange things. And, sure enough, it all got spent.\u201d There, she met and interviewed doctors, aid workers, a trauma specialist and local journalists. She undertook often arduous journeys overland to visit camps for displaced persons, some of whom followed her around, pleading to be rescued. At one point, she stayed in a convent, which, she says laughing, \u201cis one place I never expected to be\u201d. And, through her contacts, she met the girls \u2013 Rebecca, Abigail, Hope, Patience, Fatime, Amina and Hadya \u2013 whose survivor\u2019s stories she absorbed and then transformed into the novel\u2019s single, soul-searing narrative. \u201cThey each spoke to me in a similar way,\u201d she tells me, \u201cwhich was understated, reserved, guarded. They are so young and shy and protective of their modesty, even after all that has happened to them, the brutal horror of what they went through. There is shame, too, alas. It was heartbreaking and I found myself crying a lot.\u201d All of this, I venture, would have been physically and emotionally demanding for a much younger writer, never mind one in her late 80s. She nods and falls silent for a time. \u201cIt still is emotionally demanding, even to think about it. It was not just a new country for me, but a new everything. I thought I was in the Tower of Babel when I arrived in Abuja airport\u2026 the noise, the chaos. There were times when it felt like I was on a constant knife edge. And, as I say this, I feel almost mortified, because the girls I have written about are not on a knife edge, they are in hell. Their trauma continues and will stay with them for ever. At least I was able to come home.\u201d If Girl was written out of a mixture of fierce anger and deep empathy, it was also, one suspects, driven by a keen awareness of O\u2019Brien\u2019s own encroaching mortality. Is it something she finds herself dwelling on? \u201cWell, I\u2019m aware of it\u2026 I\u2019d have to be, wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019d be Pollyanna if I weren\u2019t,\u201d she shoots back, laughing. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that I think of it every day; it\u2019s more that I want to do the things that I must do. And I want to go out as someone who kept to the truth. I can\u2019t bear phoneys. I want integrity.\u201d Truth-telling of a kind was what fired her early books \u2013 The Country Girls (1960), Girl With Green Eyes (1962), Girls in Their Married Bliss (1964) \u2013 and fuelled her reputation for scandal in her homeland. The novels articulated what, until then, had remained relatively unspoken in staunchly Catholic Ireland: female sexual desire, active and acted upon. It was expressed gleefully by her young female protagonists, whose determination to enjoy themselves was, in itself, an instinctive act of rebellion against parochialism and patriarchy. The authorities responded by banning her books, the clergy by denouncing her from the pulpit. In her home town of Tuamgraney, County Clare, which she recently described as \u201cnot a town at all, but a hill with some pubs\u201d, the local postmistress told her mother that, should her daughter dare to return, she \u201cshould be kicked naked through the streets\u201d. Those early novels had other less seismic, but more abiding, reverberations. \u201cLooking at The Country Girls now, it is not so shocking,\u201d says Irish novelist Anne Enright, \u201cbut what endures is the way she portrays the friendship between the two girls. When I first read it at 16, what really chimed with me was their adventurousness, their defiant spirit. Female friendship had not been written about in that way in an Irish context until she came along.\u201d The raw material for her early books was her own young life, which, as described in her wonderfully evocative 2012 memoir, Country Girl, was both fearful and transportive. She was raised in a once-grand house, the youngest child of a beleaguered mother and a sometimes tyrannical father. \u201cHe was too fond of the drink,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut sadly for us, he was one of those unfortunate men who the drink did not agree with.\u201d She grew up in fear of his rages, often retreating as a child to the surrounding fields to daydream and to write imaginary stories in which, she recalled later, \u201cthe words ran away with me\u201d. As she got older, she became her mother\u2019s protector, her loyalty repaid by a fierce maternal love that turned to a suffocating possessiveness. When she rebelled, it was with a defiance that shocked the family and made her the talk of the parish. Having been sent to Dublin to train as a pharmacist, she met and fell for an older man, Ernest G\u00e9bler, an Irish writer of Czech-Jewish origin. She was 22 and he was 38, darkly handsome, divorced and the father of a young son. He was also an aspiring author, with a house in the country, a library and a classical music collection. \u201cThis was culture!\u201d she told Alan Yentob recently. \u201cThis was real culture!\u201d In 1958, in the hope of furthering his writing career, G\u00e9bler relocated the family to London, where O\u2019Brien found herself marooned in the drab outer suburbs of London with their two young children. It was there, in the hours between dropping off Carlo and Sasha at school and picking them up again, that she began writing, in a burst of feverish creativity. \u201cThe words poured out on to the page,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the first and only time that happened.\u201d In Country Girl, she remembers writing in floods of tears, but \u201cthey were good tears. They touched on feelings I did not know I had.\u201d They were feelings that at least one generation of young Irish women connected with deeply. As novelist Eimear McBride later put it: \u201cThe Country Girls is not the novel that broke the mould, it is the one that made it\u2026 O\u2019Brien gave voice to a previously muzzled generation of Irish women.\u201d Her suddenly unleashed creativity unwittingly incensed G\u00e9bler, who appeared at breakfast one morning with a manuscript copy of the novel in his hand. He told her: \u201cYou can write and I will never forgive you.\u201d Their marriage was dissolved in 1964 and, against the odds, O\u2019Brien was granted custody of the children after a three-year legal battle in which supposedly scandalous passages from her fourth novel, August Is a Wicked Month, were used as evidence of her wayward character. In the 1960s and 1970s, when she was famous and fashionably scandalous, her regular house parties in Chelsea drew the likes of Marlon Brando, Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum to her door. (According to her memoir, she succumbed only to the latter\u2019s advances: \u201cWe danced all the way up to the bedroom... with all the shyness of besotted strangers in syrupy songs.\u201d) For all that, though, she never remarried. I ask her if the trauma of that first, ill-fated union had hardened her against tying the knot again. She nods. \u201cI suppose I was always hooked on this idea of love, by which I mean deep love. I didn\u2019t have one-night flings, I just didn\u2019t. Not out of morality, but more my own conviction that love is so serious. Of course, it\u2019s carnal and it\u2019s many other things, but it\u2019s such a unity. I suppose I got that from my religion very early on.\u201d So, for her, love is an almost sacred ideal? \u201cSacred \u2013 with profanity,\u201d she replies, laughing. It was that other great Irish romantic, WB Yeats, who described the creative life as a process of continuous self-reinvention \u2013 \u201cMyself must I remake.\u201d As her run of late novels attests, O\u2019Brien seems to be living by that dictum. Where once she wrote about the interior lives of her female protagonists, since the mid-1990s she has looked outwards for her subject matter, at the state of things, politically and culturally. It was a typically bold move that followed a fallow period when her high lyrical style felt out of fashion with reviewers and audiences alike. \u201cLiterature is a volatile business,\u201d says her son, Carlo. \u201cYou are dependent on your latest success. When the critical tide turned against her, she shifted her voice. It became less lyrical, but there was absolute fidelity to clarity, lucidity and directness. It is those virtues that are at the centre of her literary practice.\u201d The shift occurred, O\u2019Brien tells me, \u201cas my conscience and my consciousness opened out a bit to what was happening around me.\u201d The first evidence of this change in style and subject matter came with 1994\u2019s The House of Splendid Isolation, the first of what might be called her state-of-the-nation novels. It remains an interestingly flawed book, almost postmodern in its fragmented narrative style, but the stylistic experimentation was all but overlooked in scathing reviews that took issue with her too-sympathetic portrayal of an Irish Republican gunman. \u201cSomeone in the Spectator said I did not deserve the gifts I had been given,\u201d she says, still sounding mortally offended. Though her writing had, as she puts it, \u201cdeepened and darkened\u201d, she was doing what she had always done: writing against the received wisdoms that prevailed in her homeland. \u201cIn the south of Ireland, what you heard most often was that there was a war going on up there in the north and that they were all as bad as each other. I felt that was both untrue on the ground and untrue to history, to what will be written and said 50 years from now.\u201d Controversy also stalked her 2002 novel, In the Forest, which drew on a real tragedy that had transfixed Ireland eight years before: the triple murder of a mother, child and priest by a mentally disturbed man. The pre-eminent Irish critic, Fintan O\u2019Toole, described it as \u201ca novel too far\u201d, later writing that \u201cthere is simply no artistic need for so close an intrusion into other people\u2019s grief\u201d. When I broach that criticism now, she takes a deep breath and says: \u201cIf Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez or other writers write those sort of stories, they are not attacked in their own country for it; but I am and I always have been attacked. I partly think it\u2019s to do with being a woman\u2026 and with the assumption that I approach themes that I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d O\u2019Brien remains an indomitable presence, the defiance and determination that drove her younger self still apparent despite her physical fragility. A few weeks after we speak, she sends me an email suggesting she is aware that, at 88, she may still provoke controversy with the publication of Girl. The email reads: \u201cIt has been suggested to me that as an outsider I am not eligible to write this story. I do not subscribe to that devious form of censorship. Theme and territory belong to all who aspire to tell it and the only criteria [sic] is the gravity in the telling. I was haunted by the plight of girls in north-east Nigeria, Chibok and others, thrust into servitude, their childhoods stolen, the leeching of hope day by day. I marvel at their magnificent fortitude. The world is crying out for such stories to be told and I intend to explore them while there is a writing bone left in my body.\u201d Her life, though, like her work, has become pared down. \u201cI\u2019m no longer a habitue of the social whirl,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cBut I love real conversations, whether with a shepherd or Schopenhauer, I don\u2019t care. So long as one is lifted from one\u2019s own stew to other things \u2013 and learning, always learning.\u201d When she\u2019s not writing, she says to my surprise, she watches football: \u201cI love football, all football.\u201d Of late, too, she has been transfixed by the HBO series Chernobyl: \u201cIt was so meticulously plotted I kept thinking of the opening chapters of War and Peace.\u201d I ask her if, despite her run-ins with the Irish clergy, she is spiritually inclined. \u201cI think so, yes. I have the necessity to think there is a God, but not the God I was breastfed on\u2026 a more compassionate one. But, when faced with the horror we see on the nightly news, any sane person would wonder, where is God in this scenario? So I am very puzzled and divided by God. That\u2019s honestly how I feel.\u201d Though she has no plans to return to Ireland, she has \u201ca very lovely grave\u201d there. It is situated on a holy island on the River Shannon. \u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s family grave, but, ironically, she herself is not buried there, because she wanted her grave to be in a village where people passing by would say a prayer for her. Whereas I want the birds, and the old monasteries that are ruined, and the lake and just the song of nature.\u201d I ask her if she has any regrets. \u201cNo, not really. I have been a bit foolish in my life,\u201d she says, chuckling, \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a deep thinker, but I\u2019ve been foolish with money, foolish in love. But, regrets are a waste of time. One moves on. One has to. In the moment, I am capable of real anger, because I am a passionate and furious creature as well as being a rather tender one. I am capable of Medea murder,\u201d she says, laughing, \u201cbut I am not old and bitter.\u201d The following day, the Man Booker prize longlist is announced. Mystifyingly, Girl is not on it. When we speak again, she is disappointed, but philosophical. \u201cAll I will say is, I\u2019m not throwing in the towel yet. There will be other prizes.\u201d There may also be other books. Though she suggested recently that Girl would be her final novel, she tells me there may be another, but that it exists at present \u201conly on the nascent horizon\u201d. Still engaged, still curious, still defiant, Edna O\u2019Brien may yet surprise us once again.

      "body": "<p>I always maintain that I take on a persona when writing columns for the <em>Observer</em>: that of an adopted man, from a relatively normal social background, who is an obvious victim of imposter syndrome. I don\u2019t so much write the columns as transcribe them. The adopted man stands at my shoulder, just out of sight, biting his nails and chewing the inside of his face, mumbling things into my ear, some of which I mishear. He simply can\u2019t believe he is being employed by a posh left-leaning newspaper that his own parents wouldn\u2019t have read, and knows there has been some mistake.</p> <p>Thus, he tries to compensate by employing overfinessed language and attempting to give a good account of himself, politically and intellectually, aware that he is being scrutinised by his betters.</p> <p>Obviously, as this persona is the same as me, it is not a massive stretch to channel it, although I am surprised this other me hasn\u2019t been sacked. What is true of both the columnist and the standup characters of me is that over the period of producing work in the interregnum between the EU referendum, in June 2016, and the supposed departure date, 29 March 2019, both became increasingly angry, bitter and incoherent.</p> <p>Similarly, comments from members of the public, like those on the column republished below, from members of the public who uploaded their views to social media or the paper\u2019s website, while often astute in identifying weaknesses in the work, also become more frenzied as the months pass, as if we are witnessing a collective national unravelling of sense. Many of them, it is increasingly clear, are also the work of anonymous agents, perhaps hired for the purpose, intent on advancing very specific disruptive processes on behalf of unnamed paymasters.</p> <p>The only voice you can trust is the one the footnotes are written in, which seems to be pursuing its own agenda: an autobiographical unburdening intent on setting various stories straight, as if the author, now suddenly finding himself in his 50s and watching the world he knows fall apart and decay as he himself in turn falls apart and decays, can sense death on the horizon and wants to leave his personal effects in order, to minimise the inconvenience caused to his family.</p> <h2>Extract<br>Observer column, 1 May 2016: \u2018The EU debate is a battle of big beasts, not beliefs\u2019</h2> <p>Last weekend I found myself trapped on an isolated, monster- infested Pacific atoll with a pair of twin psychic Japanese schoolgirls. A skyscraper-sized lizard, with three fire-breathing heads, the result of careless radioactive experiments in the 50s, and now a huge and clumsy metaphor for both the dangers of human scientific meddling with Mother Nature and postwar Japanese identity anxiety, had cornered us in a cave on the beach. *<strong>1</strong></p> <p>My new friends Lora and Moll hoped to summon to our aid a gigantic moth, with roughly the dimensions of an airship, over which they exercised a strange interspecies erotic sway. Anticipating this titanic struggle of equally matched opponents, each driven by blind instinct and insensible to reason, my thoughts naturally turned to June\u2019s forthcoming Brexit vote.</p> <p>Arguments about Brexit are tearing my family apart. In March, drunk in the late dark, and loose on the internet, I had ordered a European flag from Amazon, intending to fly it from the roof come the week of the Eurovote, so as to annoy any divs living locally.</p> <p>But I forgot about the flag and left it on the sofa, and now the cat has taken to sleeping under it. <strong>*2</strong></p> <p>Which is odd, as previously he was an avowed Eurosceptic, and would hiss aggressively whenever I put any European free jazz on the stereo. Indeed, we have on occasion used G\u00fcnter \u201cBaby\u201d Sommer\u2019s <em>H\u00f6rmusik</em> solo percussion album to drive him from the room when he made a smell.</p> <p>In a heated late-night argument with my pro-Brexit stepbrother two weeks ago, I used the contented cat\u2019s obvious happiness underneath the European flag to show him how Europe could shelter and comfort us, like cats under a flag. My stepbrother, brilliantly, snatched the European flag off the cat\u2019s back to show how the creature, and by association the nation, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/22/respect-eu-britain-outside-left-economy\" title=\"\">quite capable of functioning without the embrace of Europe</a>. I think this is an example of the kind of easy-to-understand argument the British public claim has been denied them in favour of tedious figures and facts about trade, environmental legislation, human rights and immigration.</p> <p>The cat looked annoyed and eyed both of us with resentment. Already, the Brexit debate is tearing families apart, stepbrother against stepbrother, stepbrother against stepbrother\u2011in-law, stepbrother-in-law against stepcat. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in Japan by now, anyway?\u201d he said, throwing my flag on the fire.</p> <p>A few days later I arrived in the so-called Land of the Rising Sun for a meeting with the famous Studio Haino, who had begun work on an anime version of my multiple Bafta- and British Comedy award-winning BBC2 series, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/04/stewart-lees-comedy-vehicle-bbc-bafta-james-corden\" title=\"\">Stewart Lee\u2019s Comedy Vehicle</a></em>, which they believed would play well with young Asian hipsters, jaded geisha and disillusioned samurai. <strong>*3</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee0091d80f4380cd8300f66b17808a3bfedac6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0091d80f4380cd8300f66b17808a3bfedac6c2/0_0_1458_1791/814.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of a moth with the EU flag on its wings.\" width=\"814\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because <em>Fuck! Stewart Lee Pee-Pee Charabanc</em> (the literal Japanese translation of Studio Haino\u2019s new title for the show) was already expected to be a big hit, various merchandise spin-offs were almost up and running. A string of love beads, each sporting a different picture of my face, is already available in Japanese adult stores.</p> <p>And since January I have been wearing four or five new pairs of pants a day, all of which will eventually take pride of place, when suitably soiled, in vending machines on the streets of Tokyo\u2019s most fashionable districts.</p> <p>My wife, of course, finds this turn of events ridiculous, but she will be laughing on the other side of her stupid face when the flyblown briefs she currently uses as dishcloths become priceless collector\u2019s items.</p> <p>And in the increasingly likely event of a British Brexit, the sale of these fetishised items will then fund our family\u2019s relocation to the newly independent free Scotland, from where I will harry the airwaves of England and Wales with liberally biased leftwing satire, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/lord-haw-haw-executed-william-joyce-1946\" title=\"\">Lord Haw-Haw</a> of sparkling-wine socialism.</p> <p>In retrospect, the scrum of the Scottish independence referendum looks dignified compared with the dirty war of Brexit. In Scotland, politicians on both sides of the divide at least seemed sincere in their beliefs, rather than selfishly using the nation\u2019s concerns about its future to try to secure theirs.</p> <p>Indeed, the day when Boris Johnson cynically accused the pro-Europe and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/boris-johnson-no-regrets-obama-part-kenyan-remarks\" title=\"\">\u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d President Obama</a> of being ancestrally ill-disposed towards Britain marks the moment at which the mayor of London changed from being merely a twat into a full-blown cunt.</p> <p>It is appropriate to describe Johnson with pure witless swearing, for that is all he deserves. He is of a political class where any insult, no matter how vicious, is acceptable, if it is delivered with the rhetorical flourishes and classical allusions of the public-school debating society. Hence, Cameron can scornfully sneer at Jeremy Corbyn and describe Dennis Skinner as a dinosaur, yet the venerable beast himself is dismissed from the house when he calls Cameron merely \u201cdodgy\u201d.</p> <p>The problem for the pro-Europe voter currently is that while obviously despising Cameron as both a person and a politician, one nonetheless wants him to prevail over Johnson, Gove, Iain Duncan Smith and the Brexit camp.</p> <p>And as the giant moth arrived above the beach, momentarily blocking out the Japanese sun itself, and set about the three-headed lizard with electric rays from its head, I continued to ponder the Brexit campaign.</p> <p>\u201cDid he who made the lamb make thee?\u201d asks William Blake of the Tyger. It was instinct that drove the moth and the lizard to fight, not ethics. They were as they were. Likewise, Johnson\u2019s Brexit position represents only a fight for personal betterment, not a considered view on Europe. <strong>*4</strong></p> <p>There is an African fly that lays its eggs in the jelly of children\u2019s eyes, the hatching larvae blinding them by feeding on the eye itself. But the fly has no quarrel with the child. It is merely following its nature.</p> <p>Likewise, Boris Johnson, a vile grub laying his horrible eggs in the soft jelly of the EU debate, has no agenda beyond his own advancement. He believes in nothing, and neither does his spiritual soulmate, the eye-scoffing African fly.</p> <p>We cowered in our cave, the twins and I, and watched the combat of the monsters. The honest open war of the giant moth and three-headed lizard made prime minister\u2019s questions seem contrived and banal. The earth shook beneath their feet, triggering tidal waves and rivers of lava from the atoll\u2019s smouldering volcano; vast explosions of startled birds scarred the sky; the landscape cracked. There was no \u201cMr Speaker\u201d, no \u201cOrder, order\u201d, no classical allusion and no drawing-room wit. There was only war, terrible war.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <p><strong>*1 <br></strong><em>From 1977 onwards, the Midlands television region had a slot called </em><em>The ATV Thursday Picture Show</em><em>, broadcasting innocuous movies from 4.30</em><em> to 6pm</em><em> after school. In my favourites, the giant monster epics of Japan\u2019s Toho studios, skilled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jun/29/theatre.japan\" title=\"\">kabuki theatre</a> practitioners in rubber lizard suits battled giant canvas moths and massive stucco lobsters in the beautiful ruins of miniature hand-crafted cityscapes. I was lucky enough to be able to recreate my childhood enthusiasm for the genre in a film item for series two of Stewart Lee\u2019s Comedy Vehicle, in which I, dressed in a half-Godzilla costume, attacked the physical theatre performer </em><em>Rob Thirtle</em><em> (Space Precinct, Brum, </em><em>Philip Glass\u2019s Satyagraha</em><em>), who appeared as some kind of crustacean, with a shopping bag. These Japanese monster performances still move me more than any computer-generated artifice because I can see the human hand at work. I would rush home from </em><em>Widney junior school </em><em>every Thursday, let myself in with the flowerpot latchkey and make toast, my mum still at work, ready for the highlight of the week. My favourite Japanese monster movie was </em><em>Jun Fukuda\u2019s 1967 effort Son of Godzilla</em><em>, in which Godzilla fights giant web-shooting spiders to save his ugly turnip-faced crying son, Minilla. My own father wasn\u2019t around much when I was young, and Godzilla taught me everything I know about parenting. You basically roar and stomp and everything works out in the end, as long as you love your kids and make sure that they know that. For God\u2019s sake, make sure that they know that. And kill any lobster that threatens them. Burn it! Burn its face off!!</em></p> <p><strong>*2<br></strong><em>This cat died in mysterious circumstances in 2017. We were all inconsolably distraught, to the point where friends and relatives must have worried that we had lost all sense of perspective. But for the first </em><em>10 years of our marriage, my wife and I toured our standup acts relentlessly, trying to consolidate our appeal before it was too late, one of us away performing, the other at home parenting tiny children, in lonely rotation. And that cat was a constant, the family member you saw when you got in at 4am from Telford, waiting to greet you and welcome you home. He was a conduit that closed all four of us into a circle. How many substandard spaghetti westerns did I watch in the small hours, with the cat my only companion? How many late nights would I have spent drinking alone to kill the post-show adrenaline, like some sad alcoholic, unless that cat had been sitting up with me, making a legitimate social event of what would otherwise have been evidence of a gradual slide into a terrible addiction? \u201cHave you caught any mice today?\u201d I would ask him. That cat saved our marriage, I suspect, and when he knew we would be OK, he sensed his work was done and took himself away. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like cats must be dead inside.</em></p> <p><strong>*3<br></strong><em>There is no Japanese version of Stewart Lee\u2019s Comedy Vehicle, though much of my standup appears on YouTube with handmade Russian subtitles, and a Russian comedy fan has had a tattoo of one of my jokes, about the 70s Liverpudlian comedian </em><em>Tom O\u2019Connor</em><em>, done on his arm, despite none of my work, or that of Tom O\u2019Connor, being available commercially in Russia. How did I get here?<strong><br><br>*4<br></strong>Last year, I organised a benefit to raise money for a memorial stone for William Blake, my favourite autodidact poet-artist, even though I suspect he would have been a </em><em>leave voter. I couldn\u2019t attend the unveiling, which was lucky, as I was frightened of a lot of the people who were going to be there, but the William Blake Society gave me an impressive chunk of the leftover marble, inscribed with a gilded \u201cB\u201d by the engraver, which I was able to pretend was a birthday present I had had specially made for my wife.</em></p> <h2><strong>Below the line: readers respond to the column</strong></h2> <p><strong>Can we please keep this sort of hysteria out of the EU debate?

      "bodyText": "I always maintain that I take on a persona when writing columns for the Observer: that of an adopted man, from a relatively normal social background, who is an obvious victim of imposter syndrome. I don\u2019t so much write the columns as transcribe them. The adopted man stands at my shoulder, just out of sight, biting his nails and chewing the inside of his face, mumbling things into my ear, some of which I mishear. He simply can\u2019t believe he is being employed by a posh left-leaning newspaper that his own parents wouldn\u2019t have read, and knows there has been some mistake. Thus, he tries to compensate by employing overfinessed language and attempting to give a good account of himself, politically and intellectually, aware that he is being scrutinised by his betters. Obviously, as this persona is the same as me, it is not a massive stretch to channel it, although I am surprised this other me hasn\u2019t been sacked. What is true of both the columnist and the standup characters of me is that over the period of producing work in the interregnum between the EU referendum, in June 2016, and the supposed departure date, 29 March 2019, both became increasingly angry, bitter and incoherent. Similarly, comments from members of the public, like those on the column republished below, from members of the public who uploaded their views to social media or the paper\u2019s website, while often astute in identifying weaknesses in the work, also become more frenzied as the months pass, as if we are witnessing a collective national unravelling of sense. Many of them, it is increasingly clear, are also the work of anonymous agents, perhaps hired for the purpose, intent on advancing very specific disruptive processes on behalf of unnamed paymasters. The only voice you can trust is the one the footnotes are written in, which seems to be pursuing its own agenda: an autobiographical unburdening intent on setting various stories straight, as if the author, now suddenly finding himself in his 50s and watching the world he knows fall apart and decay as he himself in turn falls apart and decays, can sense death on the horizon and wants to leave his personal effects in order, to minimise the inconvenience caused to his family. Extract Observer column, 1 May 2016: \u2018The EU debate is a battle of big beasts, not beliefs\u2019 Last weekend I found myself trapped on an isolated, monster- infested Pacific atoll with a pair of twin psychic Japanese schoolgirls. A skyscraper-sized lizard, with three fire-breathing heads, the result of careless radioactive experiments in the 50s, and now a huge and clumsy metaphor for both the dangers of human scientific meddling with Mother Nature and postwar Japanese identity anxiety, had cornered us in a cave on the beach. *1 My new friends Lora and Moll hoped to summon to our aid a gigantic moth, with roughly the dimensions of an airship, over which they exercised a strange interspecies erotic sway. Anticipating this titanic struggle of equally matched opponents, each driven by blind instinct and insensible to reason, my thoughts naturally turned to June\u2019s forthcoming Brexit vote. Arguments about Brexit are tearing my family apart. In March, drunk in the late dark, and loose on the internet, I had ordered a European flag from Amazon, intending to fly it from the roof come the week of the Eurovote, so as to annoy any divs living locally. But I forgot about the flag and left it on the sofa, and now the cat has taken to sleeping under it. *2 Which is odd, as previously he was an avowed Eurosceptic, and would hiss aggressively whenever I put any European free jazz on the stereo. Indeed, we have on occasion used G\u00fcnter \u201cBaby\u201d Sommer\u2019s H\u00f6rmusik solo percussion album to drive him from the room when he made a smell. In a heated late-night argument with my pro-Brexit stepbrother two weeks ago, I used the contented cat\u2019s obvious happiness underneath the European flag to show him how Europe could shelter and comfort us, like cats under a flag. My stepbrother, brilliantly, snatched the European flag off the cat\u2019s back to show how the creature, and by association the nation, was quite capable of functioning without the embrace of Europe. I think this is an example of the kind of easy-to-understand argument the British public claim has been denied them in favour of tedious figures and facts about trade, environmental legislation, human rights and immigration. The cat looked annoyed and eyed both of us with resentment. Already, the Brexit debate is tearing families apart, stepbrother against stepbrother, stepbrother against stepbrother\u2011in-law, stepbrother-in-law against stepcat. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in Japan by now, anyway?\u201d he said, throwing my flag on the fire. A few days later I arrived in the so-called Land of the Rising Sun for a meeting with the famous Studio Haino, who had begun work on an anime version of my multiple Bafta- and British Comedy award-winning BBC2 series, Stewart Lee\u2019s Comedy Vehicle, which they believed would play well with young Asian hipsters, jaded geisha and disillusioned samurai. *3 Because Fuck! Stewart Lee Pee-Pee Charabanc (the literal Japanese translation of Studio Haino\u2019s new title for the show) was already expected to be a big hit, various merchandise spin-offs were almost up and running. A string of love beads, each sporting a different picture of my face, is already available in Japanese adult stores. And since January I have been wearing four or five new pairs of pants a day, all of which will eventually take pride of place, when suitably soiled, in vending machines on the streets of Tokyo\u2019s most fashionable districts. My wife, of course, finds this turn of events ridiculous, but she will be laughing on the other side of her stupid face when the flyblown briefs she currently uses as dishcloths become priceless collector\u2019s items. And in the increasingly likely event of a British Brexit, the sale of these fetishised items will then fund our family\u2019s relocation to the newly independent free Scotland, from where I will harry the airwaves of England and Wales with liberally biased leftwing satire, the Lord Haw-Haw of sparkling-wine socialism. In retrospect, the scrum of the Scottish independence referendum looks dignified compared with the dirty war of Brexit. In Scotland, politicians on both sides of the divide at least seemed sincere in their beliefs, rather than selfishly using the nation\u2019s concerns about its future to try to secure theirs. Indeed, the day when Boris Johnson cynically accused the pro-Europe and \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d President Obama of being ancestrally ill-disposed towards Britain marks the moment at which the mayor of London changed from being merely a twat into a full-blown cunt. It is appropriate to describe Johnson with pure witless swearing, for that is all he deserves. He is of a political class where any insult, no matter how vicious, is acceptable, if it is delivered with the rhetorical flourishes and classical allusions of the public-school debating society. Hence, Cameron can scornfully sneer at Jeremy Corbyn and describe Dennis Skinner as a dinosaur, yet the venerable beast himself is dismissed from the house when he calls Cameron merely \u201cdodgy\u201d. The problem for the pro-Europe voter currently is that while obviously despising Cameron as both a person and a politician, one nonetheless wants him to prevail over Johnson, Gove, Iain Duncan Smith and the Brexit camp. And as the giant moth arrived above the beach, momentarily blocking out the Japanese sun itself, and set about the three-headed lizard with electric rays from its head, I continued to ponder the Brexit campaign. \u201cDid he who made the lamb make thee?\u201d asks William Blake of the Tyger. It was instinct that drove the moth and the lizard to fight, not ethics. They were as they were. Likewise, Johnson\u2019s Brexit position represents only a fight for personal betterment, not a considered view on Europe. *4 There is an African fly that lays its eggs in the jelly of children\u2019s eyes, the hatching larvae blinding them by feeding on the eye itself. But the fly has no quarrel with the child. It is merely following its nature. Likewise, Boris Johnson, a vile grub laying his horrible eggs in the soft jelly of the EU debate, has no agenda beyond his own advancement. He believes in nothing, and neither does his spiritual soulmate, the eye-scoffing African fly. We cowered in our cave, the twins and I, and watched the combat of the monsters. The honest open war of the giant moth and three-headed lizard made prime minister\u2019s questions seem contrived and banal. The earth shook beneath their feet, triggering tidal waves and rivers of lava from the atoll\u2019s smouldering volcano; vast explosions of startled birds scarred the sky; the landscape cracked. There was no \u201cMr Speaker\u201d, no \u201cOrder, order\u201d, no classical allusion and no drawing-room wit. There was only war, terrible war. Footnotes *1 From 1977 onwards, the Midlands television region had a slot called The ATV Thursday Picture Show, broadcasting innocuous movies from 4.30 to 6pm after school. In my favourites, the giant monster epics of Japan\u2019s Toho studios, skilled kabuki theatre practitioners in rubber lizard suits battled giant canvas moths and massive stucco lobsters in the beautiful ruins of miniature hand-crafted cityscapes. I was lucky enough to be able to recreate my childhood enthusiasm for the genre in a film item for series two of Stewart Lee\u2019s Comedy Vehicle, in which I, dressed in a half-Godzilla costume, attacked the physical theatre performer Rob Thirtle (Space Precinct, Brum, Philip Glass\u2019s Satyagraha), who appeared as some kind of crustacean, with a shopping bag. These Japanese monster performances still move me more than any computer-generated artifice because I can see the human hand at work. I would rush home from Widney junior school every Thursday, let myself in with the flowerpot latchkey and make toast, my mum still at work, ready for the highlight of the week. My favourite Japanese monster movie was Jun Fukuda\u2019s 1967 effort Son of Godzilla, in which Godzilla fights giant web-shooting spiders to save his ugly turnip-faced crying son, Minilla. My own father wasn\u2019t around much when I was young, and Godzilla taught me everything I know about parenting. You basically roar and stomp and everything works out in the end, as long as you love your kids and make sure that they know that. For God\u2019s sake, make sure that they know that. And kill any lobster that threatens them. Burn it! Burn its face off!! *2 This cat died in mysterious circumstances in 2017. We were all inconsolably distraught, to the point where friends and relatives must have worried that we had lost all sense of perspective. But for the first 10 years of our marriage, my wife and I toured our standup acts relentlessly, trying to consolidate our appeal before it was too late, one of us away performing, the other at home parenting tiny children, in lonely rotation. And that cat was a constant, the family member you saw when you got in at 4am from Telford, waiting to greet you and welcome you home. He was a conduit that closed all four of us into a circle. How many substandard spaghetti westerns did I watch in the small hours, with the cat my only companion? How many late nights would I have spent drinking alone to kill the post-show adrenaline, like some sad alcoholic, unless that cat had been sitting up with me, making a legitimate social event of what would otherwise have been evidence of a gradual slide into a terrible addiction? \u201cHave you caught any mice today?\u201d I would ask him. That cat saved our marriage, I suspect, and when he knew we would be OK, he sensed his work was done and took himself away. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like cats must be dead inside. *3 There is no Japanese version of Stewart Lee\u2019s Comedy Vehicle, though much of my standup appears on YouTube with handmade Russian subtitles, and a Russian comedy fan has had a tattoo of one of my jokes, about the 70s Liverpudlian comedian Tom O\u2019Connor, done on his arm, despite none of my work, or that of Tom O\u2019Connor, being available commercially in Russia. How did I get here? *4 Last year, I organised a benefit to raise money for a memorial stone for William Blake, my favourite autodidact poet-artist, even though I suspect he would have been a leave voter. I couldn\u2019t attend the unveiling, which was lucky, as I was frightened of a lot of the people who were going to be there, but the William Blake Society gave me an impressive chunk of the leftover marble, inscribed with a gilded \u201cB\u201d by the engraver, which I was able to pretend was a birthday present I had had specially made for my wife. Below the line: readers respond to the column Can we please keep this sort of hysteria out of the EU debate? We need sober analysis and reflection, not this. Richard Whittington Stewart Lee: a propagandist masquerading as a comedian, who is promoted as sophisticated and as a confidence trick to make people buy into the narrative.

I am confused why the prime minister would say that.\u201d Before the flight Hossaini oozed confidence. \u201cNothing scares me, sometimes I see a plane crash on the news but it doesn\u2019t scare me, only one in every few thousand crashes.\u201d Her calm disposition has come in useful. Her flight over Kent began with an overland journey from Tehran, where she had been living as a refugee with her Afghan parents, to the Turkish coast. She survived the notoriously dangerous sea crossing to Greece. But she later described the Channel crossing as much worse. From Athens, Hossaini flew to Austria before making her way to northern France. Her mother remains in a Greek refugee camp. \u201cShe is OK and very happy to hear that I am flying, maybe one day I can get her,\u201d said Hossaini, who in the earlier Observer article was called Ameena to protect her identity as a minor. While her asylum application is being processed she is studying English and maths at Canterbury College. In the meantime she is making plans for a career as a pilot. \u201cI will fly the crew at Kran on holiday to wherever they want,\u201d she said. Chapman answered: \u201cThailand please!\u201d Hossaini smiled: \u201cOK, sure.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On an unfavourable day, viewing Brexit-era Britain from the outside is like watching a goldfish circling the castle ornament in its bowl. The country seems short of memory, hazy of sight and prone to fluttering around kitsch visions of the past.</p> \n<p>The reporting of Boris Johnson\u2019s tour of Europe was a case in point. Eurosceptic tabloids celebrated the supposed infectiousness of the prime minister\u2019s optimism: \u201cJa, we can,\u201d ventriloquised the <em>Daily Mail</em> over a photo of Angela Merkel sharing a drink with him. On Friday, the newspaper covered his return from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/22/emmanuel-macron-backs-month-of-talks-to-agree-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">meeting with Emmanuel Macron</a> with a shot of him raising his hands over his head in victory. By contrast, some Remainers saw in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/21/merkel-gives-johnson-30-days-to-find-solution-to-avoid-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Merkel\u2019s comment</a> \u2013 \u201cwe could also find [a solution] in the next 30 days, why not?\u201d \u2013 an attempt to mock or troll the prime minister. They rolled their eyes at film footage seemingly showing Macron urging Johnson to get his feet off a table during their meeting in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.</p> \n<p>The Brexiters were farthest from the mark. It was simply not true, as even the BBC implied, that Merkel suggested that the Northern Irish backstop has a decent chance of being replaced within a month. And Peter Oborne\u2019s claim in the <em>Mail</em> that \u201cJohnson triumphed in Berlin\u201d was utter nonsense. The German chancellor had not remotely wavered from her red lines. Like other EU leaders, she remains committed to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and will only resile from the backstop if Britain comes up with a viable alternative. Macron went even further, stressing that the mechanism is \u201cindispensable\u201d.</p> \n<p>Yet neither did the prime minister experience the slap-downs that some on the other end of the spectrum detected. Merkel\u2019s comments were no mockery; not for the first time, British commentators of various stripes were reading too much into her words. And full footage of the Paris incident showed Macron joking that Johnson could put his feet on the table. The prime minister obliged only for fractions of a second, cameras flashing, before continuing their conversation in a more respectful pose.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/23/pm-warns-ministers-over-bullying-leaking-or-trying-to-stop-brexit\">PM warns ministers over bullying, leaking or trying to stop Brexit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While EU leaders have not changed their conditions, the looming deadline of 31 October is prompting them to re-engage with the question of how to make those conditions sellable in Britain. Their exasperation mingles with regret and a serious desire to minimise the losses from Brexit. Not for them the childish diversion of trolling a major head of government for likes.</p> \n<p>The facts, the raw realpolitik, of the matter are quite simple. EU leaders want to protect Ireland and believe that they have already gone far enough in Britain\u2019s direction by proposing a backstop allowing some of the benefits of full membership without the costs. Brexiters want to leave the club on unrealistically favourable terms and under their current leadership tend to impatience. Remainers want to stop the process, but are divided and do not have an easy path to power. Any deal will require compromise. In the absence of a mutually acceptable deal, the EU is, of the two parties, the much larger and better prepared to walk. The brutal logic of 1:9, the ratio of British to remaining EU GDP, cannot be gainsaid. Seen from some corners of Brussels, such calculations are the only ones that matter.</p> \n<p>This bare reading of the facts is misleading, however, as it does not take into account what one might call the history factor. Perceptions of history are emotional. They get in the way of bald calculations of power and narrow advantage. That makes the developments of the next weeks much harder to game out than the realpolitik alone might suggest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cc9bd1a2-35b5-4438-a4ec-620c5fa64268\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LOHgDgPVz9w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The subject is the interest linking all of the major players in the Brexit drama. Macron and Merkel are both history nerds and devour books on it. The chancellor celebrated her 60th birthday five years ago by inviting the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/29/angela-merkel-jurgen-osterhammel-the-transformation-of-the-world-book-germany\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Osterhammel</a> to lecture her guests on \u201cthe horizon of history\u201d. She later gave members of her cabinet copies of <em>The Sleepwalkers</em>, Christopher Clark\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/19/sleepwalkers-christopher-clark-review\" title=\"\">account of the prelude</a> to the first world war.

      "bodyText": "On an unfavourable day, viewing Brexit-era Britain from the outside is like watching a goldfish circling the castle ornament in its bowl. The country seems short of memory, hazy of sight and prone to fluttering around kitsch visions of the past. The reporting of Boris Johnson\u2019s tour of Europe was a case in point. Eurosceptic tabloids celebrated the supposed infectiousness of the prime minister\u2019s optimism: \u201cJa, we can,\u201d ventriloquised the Daily Mail over a photo of Angela Merkel sharing a drink with him. On Friday, the newspaper covered his return from a meeting with Emmanuel Macron with a shot of him raising his hands over his head in victory. By contrast, some Remainers saw in Merkel\u2019s comment \u2013 \u201cwe could also find [a solution] in the next 30 days, why not?\u201d \u2013 an attempt to mock or troll the prime minister. They rolled their eyes at film footage seemingly showing Macron urging Johnson to get his feet off a table during their meeting in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The Brexiters were farthest from the mark. It was simply not true, as even the BBC implied, that Merkel suggested that the Northern Irish backstop has a decent chance of being replaced within a month. And Peter Oborne\u2019s claim in the Mail that \u201cJohnson triumphed in Berlin\u201d was utter nonsense. The German chancellor had not remotely wavered from her red lines. Like other EU leaders, she remains committed to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and will only resile from the backstop if Britain comes up with a viable alternative. Macron went even further, stressing that the mechanism is \u201cindispensable\u201d. Yet neither did the prime minister experience the slap-downs that some on the other end of the spectrum detected. Merkel\u2019s comments were no mockery; not for the first time, British commentators of various stripes were reading too much into her words. And full footage of the Paris incident showed Macron joking that Johnson could put his feet on the table. The prime minister obliged only for fractions of a second, cameras flashing, before continuing their conversation in a more respectful pose. While EU leaders have not changed their conditions, the looming deadline of 31 October is prompting them to re-engage with the question of how to make those conditions sellable in Britain. Their exasperation mingles with regret and a serious desire to minimise the losses from Brexit. Not for them the childish diversion of trolling a major head of government for likes. The facts, the raw realpolitik, of the matter are quite simple. EU leaders want to protect Ireland and believe that they have already gone far enough in Britain\u2019s direction by proposing a backstop allowing some of the benefits of full membership without the costs. Brexiters want to leave the club on unrealistically favourable terms and under their current leadership tend to impatience. Remainers want to stop the process, but are divided and do not have an easy path to power. Any deal will require compromise. In the absence of a mutually acceptable deal, the EU is, of the two parties, the much larger and better prepared to walk. The brutal logic of 1:9, the ratio of British to remaining EU GDP, cannot be gainsaid. Seen from some corners of Brussels, such calculations are the only ones that matter. This bare reading of the facts is misleading, however, as it does not take into account what one might call the history factor. Perceptions of history are emotional. They get in the way of bald calculations of power and narrow advantage. That makes the developments of the next weeks much harder to game out than the realpolitik alone might suggest. The subject is the interest linking all of the major players in the Brexit drama. Macron and Merkel are both history nerds and devour books on it. The chancellor celebrated her 60th birthday five years ago by inviting the historian J\u00fcrgen Osterhammel to lecture her guests on \u201cthe horizon of history\u201d. She later gave members of her cabinet copies of The Sleepwalkers, Christopher Clark\u2019s account of the prelude to the first world war. Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg have both written their own, albeit poorly reviewed, history books, while Dominic Cummings writes about alternative outcomes of recent political events as \u201cbranching histories\u201d. For their part, Remainers often turn to Britain\u2019s intensively European past for proof of the country\u2019s essential link to the continent. And all sides, implicitly, have a historian\u2019s nagging interest in the future; in what the past says about what is to come; in what sort of places Britain and Europe will be in 2100 or so. This Historikerstreit may make a no-deal Brexit more likely. Remainers see their struggle as a battle for the country\u2019s open, European soul. Brexiters are often fond of Britain\u2019s supposedly buccaneering (the term seems almost obligatory) past and want a similarly free-roaming future.

      "body": "<p>A basket of vibrant purple petunias hangs at the door of Anne Quinn\u2019s home in Solihull. In July, Anne, 58, invited family and friends to celebrate the 25th birthday of her youngest daughter, Shannon. She asked guests to bring purple flowers, Shannon\u2019s favourite colour. The only person absent from the close-knit circle was Shannon herself because in January she was found dead in her bathroom at Oak House mental health rehabilitation unit, run by Camino Healthcare in Tipton in the Black Country.</p> <p>Earlier this month, at <a href=\"https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/sandwell/tipton/2019/08/07/tipton-care-home-failed-woman-who-died/\" title=\"\">Shannon\u2019s inquest</a>, coroner Zafar Siddique concluded there had been gross failings of care by staff at Oak House and that neglect had been a \u201cdirect contributory factor\u201d in her death. Shannon was supposed to be observed every five minutes. She was found hanged in her room on 9 January. A 6pm and possibly later observation had been missed, an omission not revealed until the inquest. An ambulance was called at 6.17pm. Shannon\u2019s room was littered with items that could be used to ligature.</p> <p>\u201cTo hear the coroner essentially say that with the right care Shannon would be alive today, that was hard,\u201d Anne says. \u201cShe had plans. She wanted to go back to university and become an art therapist. She was sweet, kind, gentle and very creative but you couldn\u2019t quite reach her. She called herself emotion phobic. She wrote in her diary, \u2018They say I should talk about my feelings but I don\u2019t know how.\u2019 She told me that she would wake up every morning feeling someone precious had died. I can\u2019t imagine what that must be like.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc15432c953811e137ea6b251ebf75e748eeb5c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc15432c953811e137ea6b251ebf75e748eeb5c9/0_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shannon Quinn with mother Anne Quinn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Quinn with mother Anne Quinn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Anne Quinn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Shannon\u2019s inquest, the coroner indicated that he would be writing to the Department of Health and Social Care and the Care Quality Commission, the regulator for health and social care in England, raising concerns about Oak House, including the failure to properly train staff in her complex psychiatric condition. Lisa Clayton, hired by Camino to investigate Shannon\u2019s death, said staff did not have the skills to care for Shannon and had been given just 90 minutes\u2019 training, \u201ca basic overview\u201d.</p> <p>The coroner also questioned Shannon\u2019s placement, a two-hour \u00a370 round trip taxi ride from her home. Anne and Shannon\u2019s father had split up when she was two. Anne has limited mobility and arthritis of the spine and other joints. She took early retirement from her job as a librarian 10 years ago to care for her daughter.</p> <p>Tragically, Shannon Quinn is part of an alarming pattern in which young vulnerable women have died because of multiple failures in mental health settings. Last week, Duncan Lawrence, \u201clead clinician\u201d at Lancaster Lodge care home (now closed) in Richmond, south-west London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/16/duncan-lawrence-pleads-guilty-to-neglect-lancaster-lodge-care-home-sophie-bennett-death\" title=\"\">pleaded guilty</a> to failing to provide the coroner with information about the care of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/07/care-home-chaos-contributed-to-teens-death-inquest-rules\" title=\"\">Sophie Bennett</a>, 19, who killed herself in 2016. An inquest earlier this year found Sophie, diagnosed with atypical autism, bipolar affective disorder and social anxiety disorder, had died after neglect at the home, which had descended into \u201cchaos\u201d after cost-cutting. </p> <p>In Shannon\u2019s case, she was diagnosed as dyslexic at the age of six. \u201cFrom the age of two, her ambition had been to go to university,\u201d Anne says. \u201cHer dyslexia meant she was always put in the bottom stream, and that was a trigger. She constantly worried that she wouldn\u2019t get the grades.\u201d At 14, she took an overdose. She was subsequently diagnosed as high-functioning autistic. Shannon developed anorexia and began to self-harm, refusing to attend school. Eventually she attended a school for those who cannot function well in mainstream education. \u201cOn her second day, her teacher asked to see her outside class. Shannon thought she was in trouble. He told her he wanted to put her in the gifted and talented group. It made a world of difference.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c9a7c26aad3a02bcb788818f78378516f03d75b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c9a7c26aad3a02bcb788818f78378516f03d75b/528_518_2047_2559/800.jpg\" alt=\"One of Shannon Quinn\u2019s paintings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Shannon Quinn\u2019s paintings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Anne Quinn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shannon achieved six good GCSEs and received a distinction in her BTec. Shannon and Anne also took an Open University course in the history of art, and they co-wrote a children\u2019s book about cats, each with a disability.</p> <p>In her second year at university, studying fine arts, Shannon found the experience increasingly stressful and began to drink. \u201cIf I won the lottery I\u2019d establish a university for autistic students,\u201d Anne says. Shannon was sectioned several times. She had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, manifesting itself in a range of behaviours, including difficulty in regulating emotions, fear of rejection and a pattern of self-harm.</p> <p>During the five months Shannon was at Oak House she was never formally assessed by a doctor under the Mental Health Act. \u201cWe were told she needed an opportunity to be with peers and make friends, so why [was she at] Oak House, which is mainly for people with learning disabilities?\u201d Anne asks. \u201cShe was autistic. She wanted to be regularly observed, but care at Oak House was inconsistent. Sometimes the staff searched her and sometimes they didn\u2019t. I tried to raise issues but there was almost no communication. Every day of Shannon\u2019s inquest I felt nothing but anger.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after Shannon\u2019s death, Oak House, offering private care to 16 adults, at fees said to be up to \u00a32,000 a week, was <a href=\"https://www.cqc.org.uk/provider/1-195581464\" title=\"\">rated \u201cinadequate\u201d</a> by the CQC and put in special measures. It has six months to make improvements or face closure. Fifty-three safeguarding incidents had not been reported to the local council, including allegations of sexual assault and illegal drug use.</p> <p>So why <em>was</em> Shannon at Oak House? Anne says she had been told it was her only option. In 2018-19, \u00a3100m \u2013 30% of all NHS mental health spending \u2013 went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/15/nhs-bill-for-private-out-of-area-mental-health-placements-rises-to-100m\" title=\"\">private providers nursing people outside their local area</a>. \u201cPrivate homes where the main motivation is profit shouldn\u2019t be looking after vulnerable people,\u201d Anne says. \u201cWe need to bring it all back under local authority care.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Jenkinson, chief nursing officer for Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group, involved in the decision that Oak House was appropriate, says: \u201cWhenever there is loss of life, we always work with our partners \u2026 to try and ensure similar incidents are prevented.\u201d</p> <p>Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust acted as Shannon\u2019s supervising clinicians, so why didn\u2019t it raise concerns? It says: \u201cThe trust did continue to provide support to help Shannon in her new placement and this included training for Oak House staff \u2026 We will respond in full to the coroner\u2019s concerns around information sharing between the agencies involved in this case.\u201d</p> <p>A Camino Healthcare spokesperson said: \u201cWe will \u2026 learn every lesson we can moving forward.\u201d</p> <p>An equally urgent issue is why the lessons from a growing number of deaths in NHS and private mental health facilities of vulnerable young people are not being heeded. The charity Inquest is campaigning for <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/blog/families-tell-parliament-why-bereaved-relatives-need-legal-aid-at-inquests\" title=\"\">legal aid at inquests</a> for the families of those who have died, independent investigations pre-inquest (not conducted in-house by trusts and private providers \u2013 a process that can take months and years) and the establishment of a body tasked with ensuring that coroners\u2019 recommendations are collated, applied and monitored, and learning disseminated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Private homes where the main motivation is profit shouldn\u2019t be looking after vulnerable people</p> <footer> <cite>Anne Quinn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Deborah Coles, executive director of Inquest, adds: \u201cYoung women with multiple needs are too often failed by the public services meant to keep them safe. Care involving multiple agencies is disjointed and there is woefully lacking provision for local specialist services. The devastation this causes is compounded by the fact that internal investigations are often poor, and learning from previous deaths is often missed, resulting in yet more preventable harm.\u201d</p> <p>Shannon\u2019s solicitor, Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy, says: \u201cThe coroner uncovered evidence of gross failings by Camino. The Care Quality Commission is now investigating whether that should form the basis of criminal proceedings against Camino as an organisation. It will also be important for the Crown Prosecution Service to review this evidence to consider if criminal charges should be brought against any individual staff members for perverting the course of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Shannon\u2019s sister, Caragh, 27, who has a six-year-old daughter with her partner, says: \u201cWe have had no apology from Camino, even though it took seven months to admit a check at 6pm had not been completed. My daughter lost an aunt, my mum lost her youngest daughter, I lost my only sister and the world has lost a talented soul who was so loved.\u201d</p> <p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie</em></p> <h2>Failure of care</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/amanda-briley-conclusion\" title=\"\">Amanda Briley</a>, 20, died 2016</p> <p>Autism spectrum disorder and self-harmed.

      "bodyText": "A basket of vibrant purple petunias hangs at the door of Anne Quinn\u2019s home in Solihull. In July, Anne, 58, invited family and friends to celebrate the 25th birthday of her youngest daughter, Shannon. She asked guests to bring purple flowers, Shannon\u2019s favourite colour. The only person absent from the close-knit circle was Shannon herself because in January she was found dead in her bathroom at Oak House mental health rehabilitation unit, run by Camino Healthcare in Tipton in the Black Country. Earlier this month, at Shannon\u2019s inquest, coroner Zafar Siddique concluded there had been gross failings of care by staff at Oak House and that neglect had been a \u201cdirect contributory factor\u201d in her death. Shannon was supposed to be observed every five minutes. She was found hanged in her room on 9 January. A 6pm and possibly later observation had been missed, an omission not revealed until the inquest. An ambulance was called at 6.17pm. Shannon\u2019s room was littered with items that could be used to ligature. \u201cTo hear the coroner essentially say that with the right care Shannon would be alive today, that was hard,\u201d Anne says. \u201cShe had plans. She wanted to go back to university and become an art therapist. She was sweet, kind, gentle and very creative but you couldn\u2019t quite reach her. She called herself emotion phobic. She wrote in her diary, \u2018They say I should talk about my feelings but I don\u2019t know how.\u2019 She told me that she would wake up every morning feeling someone precious had died. I can\u2019t imagine what that must be like.\u201d At Shannon\u2019s inquest, the coroner indicated that he would be writing to the Department of Health and Social Care and the Care Quality Commission, the regulator for health and social care in England, raising concerns about Oak House, including the failure to properly train staff in her complex psychiatric condition. Lisa Clayton, hired by Camino to investigate Shannon\u2019s death, said staff did not have the skills to care for Shannon and had been given just 90 minutes\u2019 training, \u201ca basic overview\u201d. The coroner also questioned Shannon\u2019s placement, a two-hour \u00a370 round trip taxi ride from her home. Anne and Shannon\u2019s father had split up when she was two. Anne has limited mobility and arthritis of the spine and other joints. She took early retirement from her job as a librarian 10 years ago to care for her daughter. Tragically, Shannon Quinn is part of an alarming pattern in which young vulnerable women have died because of multiple failures in mental health settings. Last week, Duncan Lawrence, \u201clead clinician\u201d at Lancaster Lodge care home (now closed) in Richmond, south-west London, pleaded guilty to failing to provide the coroner with information about the care of Sophie Bennett, 19, who killed herself in 2016. An inquest earlier this year found Sophie, diagnosed with atypical autism, bipolar affective disorder and social anxiety disorder, had died after neglect at the home, which had descended into \u201cchaos\u201d after cost-cutting. In Shannon\u2019s case, she was diagnosed as dyslexic at the age of six. \u201cFrom the age of two, her ambition had been to go to university,\u201d Anne says. \u201cHer dyslexia meant she was always put in the bottom stream, and that was a trigger. She constantly worried that she wouldn\u2019t get the grades.\u201d At 14, she took an overdose. She was subsequently diagnosed as high-functioning autistic. Shannon developed anorexia and began to self-harm, refusing to attend school. Eventually she attended a school for those who cannot function well in mainstream education. \u201cOn her second day, her teacher asked to see her outside class. Shannon thought she was in trouble. He told her he wanted to put her in the gifted and talented group. It made a world of difference.\u201d Shannon achieved six good GCSEs and received a distinction in her BTec. Shannon and Anne also took an Open University course in the history of art, and they co-wrote a children\u2019s book about cats, each with a disability. In her second year at university, studying fine arts, Shannon found the experience increasingly stressful and began to drink. \u201cIf I won the lottery I\u2019d establish a university for autistic students,\u201d Anne says. Shannon was sectioned several times. She had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, manifesting itself in a range of behaviours, including difficulty in regulating emotions, fear of rejection and a pattern of self-harm. During the five months Shannon was at Oak House she was never formally assessed by a doctor under the Mental Health Act. \u201cWe were told she needed an opportunity to be with peers and make friends, so why [was she at] Oak House, which is mainly for people with learning disabilities?\u201d Anne asks. \u201cShe was autistic. She wanted to be regularly observed, but care at Oak House was inconsistent. Sometimes the staff searched her and sometimes they didn\u2019t. I tried to raise issues but there was almost no communication. Every day of Shannon\u2019s inquest I felt nothing but anger.\u201d Shortly after Shannon\u2019s death, Oak House, offering private care to 16 adults, at fees said to be up to \u00a32,000 a week, was rated \u201cinadequate\u201d by the CQC and put in special measures. It has six months to make improvements or face closure. Fifty-three safeguarding incidents had not been reported to the local council, including allegations of sexual assault and illegal drug use. So why was Shannon at Oak House? Anne says she had been told it was her only option. In 2018-19, \u00a3100m \u2013 30% of all NHS mental health spending \u2013 went to private providers nursing people outside their local area. \u201cPrivate homes where the main motivation is profit shouldn\u2019t be looking after vulnerable people,\u201d Anne says. \u201cWe need to bring it all back under local authority care.\u201d Helen Jenkinson, chief nursing officer for Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group, involved in the decision that Oak House was appropriate, says: \u201cWhenever there is loss of life, we always work with our partners \u2026 to try and ensure similar incidents are prevented.\u201d Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust acted as Shannon\u2019s supervising clinicians, so why didn\u2019t it raise concerns? It says: \u201cThe trust did continue to provide support to help Shannon in her new placement and this included training for Oak House staff \u2026 We will respond in full to the coroner\u2019s concerns around information sharing between the agencies involved in this case.\u201d A Camino Healthcare spokesperson said: \u201cWe will \u2026 learn every lesson we can moving forward.\u201d An equally urgent issue is why the lessons from a growing number of deaths in NHS and private mental health facilities of vulnerable young people are not being heeded. The charity Inquest is campaigning for legal aid at inquests for the families of those who have died, independent investigations pre-inquest (not conducted in-house by trusts and private providers \u2013 a process that can take months and years) and the establishment of a body tasked with ensuring that coroners\u2019 recommendations are collated, applied and monitored, and learning disseminated. Deborah Coles, executive director of Inquest, adds: \u201cYoung women with multiple needs are too often failed by the public services meant to keep them safe. Care involving multiple agencies is disjointed and there is woefully lacking provision for local specialist services. The devastation this causes is compounded by the fact that internal investigations are often poor, and learning from previous deaths is often missed, resulting in yet more preventable harm.\u201d Shannon\u2019s solicitor, Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy, says: \u201cThe coroner uncovered evidence of gross failings by Camino. The Care Quality Commission is now investigating whether that should form the basis of criminal proceedings against Camino as an organisation. It will also be important for the Crown Prosecution Service to review this evidence to consider if criminal charges should be brought against any individual staff members for perverting the course of justice.\u201d Shannon\u2019s sister, Caragh, 27, who has a six-year-old daughter with her partner, says: \u201cWe have had no apology from Camino, even though it took seven months to admit a check at 6pm had not been completed. My daughter lost an aunt, my mum lost her youngest daughter, I lost my only sister and the world has lost a talented soul who was so loved.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie Failure of care Amanda Briley, 20, died 2016 Autism spectrum disorder and self-harmed. Inquest in 2018 concluded multiple failings by Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust contributed to her death. Sophie Bennett, 19, died 2016 Bipolar disorder, social anxiety disorder and autism. Inquest jury in 2018 found that neglect contributed to her death at Lancaster Lodge in Richmond, south-west. Zoe Watts, 19, died 2017 Anorexic and self-harmed. Inquest jury in 2018 found failings contributed to her death at centre run by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. Sophie Payne, 22, died 2017 Bipolar disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder. Inquest jury in 2018 found serious failings by St George\u2019s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Charlotte Ball, 27, died 2017 Emotionally unstable personality disorder. Inquest this year found failings by South West London and St George\u2019s Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust.",

I know she\u2019s despairing and that\u2019s what she\u2019s been saying would happen next,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nazanin has been having suicidal thoughts since her second hunger strike failed to secure her release in February, he added. \u201cShe has regularly been talking about how she can\u2019t go on. In my phone calls, I would try to give her reassurance that there are reasons to be hopeful. Obviously that\u2019s been taken away.

In the past, he has been able to persuade her to promise not to attempt suicide.

      "bodyText": "The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Iran, fears she may try to take her own life if she is not given her freedom soon. Richard Ratcliffe told the Observer he was afraid the harsh new jail conditions imposed last week could lead to a deterioration in her mental health and might trigger a suicide attempt. She is no longer permitted to call him in the UK and has been told she can only see their five-year-old daughter Gabriella once a month. Previously she had been allowed to see her twice a week. \u201cThe next escalation I would worry about is a more severe hunger strike where she ends up in hospital or a suicide attempt. I know she\u2019s despairing and that\u2019s what she\u2019s been saying would happen next,\u201d he said. Nazanin has been having suicidal thoughts since her second hunger strike failed to secure her release in February, he added. \u201cShe has regularly been talking about how she can\u2019t go on. In my phone calls, I would try to give her reassurance that there are reasons to be hopeful. Obviously that\u2019s been taken away. For me, the worry is if she\u2019s stopped from being given reasons to hope, in a context where she\u2019s got reasons not to hope, it will affect her morale and what she then decides to do.\u201d Ratcliffe said he thought Nazanin would find the separation from her daughter particularly hard. In the past, he has been able to persuade her to promise not to attempt suicide. But his wife\u2019s mental health suffered when she was handcuffed to a bed and held in solitary confinement in a mental health ward for six days, and then returned to prison. \u201cAfter that, she told me she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be able to keep her promise to me.\u201d He wants the British and Iranian governments to understand the urgency of the situation. \u201cYou\u2019ve got weeks to solve this now. I don\u2019t care how, but you\u2019ve got weeks to solve this, before the situation deteriorates.\u201d In the meantime, Ratcliffe said he was trying not to dwell on his fears about Nazanin\u2019s future actions. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to cope if I did.\u201d Last week, Ratcliffe revealed he had not been offered a high-level meeting with either the prime minister Boris Johnson or the foreign secretary Dominic Raab since they took office, despite Johnson\u2019s claim that he felt a \u201cdeep sense of anguish\u201d over her plight and having promised to prioritise her release during his leadership campaign. Raab has subsequently invited Ratcliffe to meet him in early September when Ratcliffe plans to ask him how he hopes to bring Zaghari-Ratcliffe home. \u201cI want to make sure that there\u2019s isn\u2019t a hollowing out of commitments taken by his predecessor and I want to know how he personally sees things, how he is going to solve it and how he sees the UK-Iran relationship,\u201d said Ratcliffe. Given that Britain has given his wife diplomatic protection, Ratcliffe also thinks the government should be reading Iran the riot act. \u201cRevoking her phone calls and failing to allow outside medical treatment and visits with her daughter is extraordinary and must be robustly challenged.\u201d Finally, Ratcliffe said he merely wanted Raab to explain what is going on. The Foreign Office is very cagey about its strategy, he said, and has a tendency to wait for things to calm down before deciding what it is going to do. \u201cThere isn\u2019t time to wait.

      "bodyText": "In a fashionable corner of the capital of Germany, Europe\u2019s \u201ccar nation\u201d, parents picking up or dropping off their offspring have lined the edge of a popular playground with luxury vehicles. There are summery convertibles, wood-panelled multi-seaters and slim racers \u2013 but none of them has four wheels. Jan Edler, an architect, has picked up his son Laszlo from daycare with a Bullitt, a Danish-built cargo bike with a platform spacious enough to fit the one-year-old and the daily grocery shopping. The family car, he says, has been gathering rust ever since he invested in the aluminium-framed two-wheeler, partly because cargo bikes manage to evoke the same romantic notions that cars once used to: \u201cI just find it an incredibly liberating experience to get around a city on a cargo bike,\u201d Edel says. \u201cI feel safe among the traffic, and my son has something to look at.\u201d With new CO2 emissions targets due to be phased in from 2020 and the reputation of Germany\u2019s car industry in urgent need of repair after the dieselgate scandal, the country\u2019s federal government has been trying hard to think of ways to achieve what it calls the Verkehrswende, the green transformation of its transport sector. A \u20ac4,000 purchase subsidy for e-cars, belatedly introduced after the emissions scandal in 2016, was meant to make the autobahn nation go electric \u2013 but the number of registered plug-in vehicles on Germany\u2019s streets still falls way short of the target of 1 million set for 2020. Then the use of electric scooters was legalised across Germany in mid-June, in the hope that they might help to reduce the carbon footprint of urban areas \u2013 but first studies show the rentable vehicles to be mainly a fun gimmick appealing to tourists rather than a genuine alternative for commuters. Instead, the real boom has taken place in the cargo bike sector, largely independent of support from the national government and the powerful car industry, powered instead by local initiatives and smaller startups. According to Germany\u2019s Two-wheel Industry Association (ZIV), 39,200 electrically powered cargo bikes were sold across the country last year, compared with only 36,062 newly registered electric cars, in spite of smaller subsidies. Robust, easy to park and never slowed down by traffic jams, the cargo bike has been discovered as an efficient alternative to four-wheel transport not just by parents on the nursery or school run, but also carpenters, plumbers, photographers, even chimney sweeps. Yet with prices ranging from \u20ac2,000 to \u20ac5,000, they are also not cheap. In Berlin, authorities were overrun by requests last year after the city senate opened up a pot of purchase subsidies for cargo bikes for private, shared and commercial use \u2013 \u20ac1,000 for those with electronic motors, \u20ac500 for pedal-only powered bikes. Within a day, the senate received 1,950 applications and had to draw lots to decide which eager cyclists could be rewarded. The scheme\u2019s success has opened eyes to the allure of cargo bikes \u2013 and not just in Berlin. In the capital, there are plans for a similar round of subsidies later this year \u2013 and similar financial support is now available in more than 20 cities across Germany and the states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, North-Rhine Westphalia and Saarland. In Freising, near Munich, people can cash in an extra \u20ac500 premium if they can prove that they are using their new bike to replace a petrol- or diesel-power vehicle. In May, Berlin\u2019s Neuk\u00f6lln district unveiled the city\u2019s first cargo-bike-only parking spot, and in the Prenzlauer Berg area the senate has just successfully completed a one-year trial run for a \u201cmicro-depot\u201d which courier companies such as DHL or UPS can use to deliver parcels using only cargo bikes instead of vans. While Germany still lags behind Denmark and the Netherlands in terms of per-capita use, the country is now Europe\u2019s largest market for cargo bikes in overall numbers. Next month\u2019s annual Eurobike trade fair, in Friedrichshafen from 4-7 September, will see the unveiling of a dizzying array of new models not just by Dutch market leaders Bakfiets and Urban Arrow, but also by growing German newcomers, like the compact and foldable Muli or Cologne-based three-wheeler Chike. When Volkswagen tried to muscle in on the booming industry with the launch of its own cargo bike at last year\u2019s fair, the carmaking giant\u2019s offer was met with scathing reviews by the bike community. The secret of the bike\u2019s success is also the same aspect that invites criticism. Unlike the humble bicycle, cargo bikes are increasingly status symbols. \u201cWe find sales patterns work on the keeping-up-with-the-Joneses principle\u201d, said Philipp Runge, a sales adviser at Ahoi Velo, a cargo bike specialist retailer in Hamburg. \u201cPeople tend to want to buy the same bike their neighbour owns.\u201d Increasingly, Runge said, his customers were happy to pay an extra couple of thousand euros for limited-edition models, such as Dutch manufacturer Urban Arrow\u2019s \u20ac7,000 bike with a belt drive, automated gears and brake lights. \u201cMotor cars are becoming an irrelevance for our customers. Some of them are truly beginning to hate cars.\u201d But as a symbol of the lifestyle choices of environmentally conscious metropolitans, some have already begun using the cargo bike as the perfect vehicle for Germany\u2019s brewing culture war. In Saxony-Anhalt, rightwing populist party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland last month voted against a subsidy programme for the vehicles, describing it as a \u201cpure waste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d. To believe that 200 subsidised cargo bikes could save the climate, said AfD politician Matthias B\u00fcttner, was \u201ccrazy politics\u201d. \u201cThe image of cargo bikes as an SUV for eco-warriors is off the mark,\u201d said Arne Behrensen, who runs a pressure group called Cargobike.Jetzt, which tries to make the vehicles more acceptable across all layers of society. \u201cWhatever the size of your cargo bike, it always involves downsizing compared to a car.\u201d Behrensen urged Angela Merkel\u2019s government to wake up to the potential of two- and three-wheelers if it took the challenge of transforming its transport infrastructure seriously. \u201cA purchase premium of \u20ac2,000 per head for cargo bikes instead of electric cars, that would have been a start.

Manchester United, the most successful English side, have won only 16.7% of all league titles: compare that to Bayern (50%), Real Madrid (37.5%) or Juventus (30.4%). Historically, there has been a greater fluidity at the top of English football than in any other major league: the top two sides of two decades ago aren\u2019t even the best sides in their respective cities now, a situation almost unthinkable elsewhere. But there is a certain grim logic to a super-league. What, after all, is the point of super-clubs collecting seven, eight, nine league titles in a row, even when they\u2019re not playing particularly well? The Champions League already skews competition because its rewards are so out of sync with what is available domestically. Porto\u2019s defeat in this season\u2019s preliminaries has devastated their financial planning. Or take Cyprus, where no team had retained the title in 12 years before Apoel reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2012: inflated by the revenue that brought, they have won the championship every year since. Almost everywhere but the Premier League, the status quo cannot hold. This is football in a globalised culture, everything hollowed out to service the elite, the super-clubs from western Europe who draw support from across the world. In the final rounds of the Champions League, the spectacle and drama is extraordinary. But for smaller clubs the future is bleak. Do you hear the people sing? Not much. Not any more.",

Each opportunity for rescue is swiftly scuppered but, as former swimming coach Dave tells his daughter, their escape is mind over matter (\u201cI keep telling you, it\u2019s not your body that\u2019s stopping you\u201d). The scenes of family bonding are tiresome but the action is mostly tense and cheerfully bloody. French film-maker Aja directed remakes of The Hills Have Eyes (2006) and Piranha (2010); clearly, he has an appreciation for trashy B-movies. Crawl benefits from its economical 87-minute runtime, but as a genre piece it\u2019s perhaps more skin than muscle.",

      "body": "<p>A decade ago, Zahia Dehar, a French-Algerian teenager, woke up to find her picture on the front of France\u2019s newspapers as the underage girl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/ribery-benzema-underaged-prostitution-trial\" title=\"\">caught up in a prostitution scandal</a> involving members of the national football squad.</p> <p>She was an escort that star player Franck Rib\u00e9ry was said to have solicited as a \u201cbirthday present\u201d to himself. Aged 18 when the scandal broke \u2013 and just 17 at the time of the incident \u2013 Dehar seemed destined to be defined for life by the sordid story.</p> <p>But she refused to let it define her. For young woman, driven to thoughts of suicide, it was a question of survival. \u201cI had the choice between killing myself or going forward. I didn\u2019t want to kill myself,\u201d she said afterwards.</p> <p>Today, the 27-year-old model, lingerie designer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/15/zahia-dehar-muse-french-scandal\" title=\"\">muse to the late couturier Karl Lagerfeld</a> is celebrating her first film role and has found herself compared to a young Brigitte Bardot.</p> <p>In<em> </em><em>Une </em><em>Fille </em><em>Facile</em> (<em>An Easy Girl</em>), released in France on Wednesday, Dehar plays the liberated Sofia, who sleeps with rich men who buy her gifts; it is set in a steamy summer in the south of France, featuring sun, sea, sand and sex, with luxury yachts and jewels thrown in. One reviewer said the film had a \u201cclassically Gallic nonchalance when it comes to sex\u201d.</p> <p>The French culture magazine <em>Les Inrockuptibles</em> ran a front page with the headline \u201c<em>Et dieu cr\u00e9a Zahia</em>\u201d (And God created Zahia), a reference to Roger Vadim\u2019s 1956 film <em>And God Created Woman</em>, which launched Bardot\u2019s career.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018An easy girl\u2019 is not pejorative: it\u2019s a woman who submerges herself in her sexuality like a man. It\u2019s rare to see a woman like Sofia celebrated like that,\u201d Dehar said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f52cf59d8d6cf7ce0e91d19b8407334eafb558e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f52cf59d8d6cf7ce0e91d19b8407334eafb558e4/0_315_2003_2503/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dehar with the director of Une Fille Facile, Rebecca Zlotowski.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dehar with the director of Une Fille Facile, Rebecca Zlotowski.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foc Kan/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Ghriss, Algeria, Dehar came to France at the age of 10 with her mother and younger brother after their parents\u2019 divorce. By the time she was 16, uninterested in boys her own age, she made a decision, she says, to sleep with older men for money. By night, she frequented high-class clubs in Paris, returning home in the early hours to change for school.</p> <p>The first her mother learned of it was when the scandal broke involving Rib\u00e9ry and Karim Benzema, the Real Madrid striker. \u201cShe heard about it on the television and was very shocked. But she was never aggressive with me. She was mostly worried,\u201d Dehar said.</p> <p>\u201cI was not in a good place until I told myself that what I did was not a crime.\u201d</p> <p>Rib\u00e9ry and Benzema were investigated and in 2014 the charges against them were dropped, with the judge ruling there was insufficient proof they had known Dehar was underage.</p> <p>Dehar says the affair still haunts her. \u201cI experienced it as a shock, a catastrophe \u2026 I had the feeling that my adult life had barely begun but had no future,\u201d she told <em>Les Inrockuptibles</em>. \u201cI felt trapped in a box, the box of banned, stoned women \u2026 I really felt very bad and I even thought of killing myself because I believed I no longer had a life. I felt as if I was a monster that had to be hidden.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Dehar told <em>Antidote</em> magazine: \u201cI was very ill, I didn\u2019t go out, I saw nobody \u2026 I was \u2018Zahia the whore\u2019. And I knew that, in society, that kind of woman is seen as diabolical.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of being ostracised, however, Dehar received modelling offers, inspired the artists Pierre et Gilles to portray her as Marianne, the feminine symbol of the French state, and was photographed by Lagerfeld, who supported a lingerie collection she launched.</p> <p>Some critics see art imitating life, describing Dehar\u2019s role in <em>Une </em><em>Fille </em><em>Facile</em> as that of a blank canvas on to which the men in the film project their fantasies, albeit tempered by her character\u2019s independence and wit.</p> <p>The film\u2019s writer and director, Rebecca Zlotowski, a founder member of the 50/50 collective \u2013 a French organisation set up in response to #MeToo that rejects the perceived \u201cAnglo-Saxon puritanism\u201d of the US-born movement \u2013 says her film is \u201can amoral summer story\u201d. Its subject is \u201cthe question of strength, power, domination in all fields\u201d, she says.</p> <p>\u201cTo be a feminist, you don\u2019t need to show female astronauts or neurosurgeons. I like to show women in extreme femininity,\u201d Zlotowski says.</p> <p>The film has highlighted again the contrary response in France to #MeToo. After the allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and rape against Harvey Weinstein, a number of high-profile French women, including the actress Catherine Deneuve, accused feminist campaigners of attacking men\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to hit on women.</p> <p>Zlotowski <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/easy-girl-director-rebecca-zlotowski-cannes-2019-interview-1213193\" title=\"\">told the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a>: \u201cWe have a Latin culture that always feels a little bit threatened by American puritanism \u2026 [The French] want to keep their wild sexuality.\u201d She maintains the most powerful tools to combat sexism and misogyny are \u201ceconomics \u2026 and humour\u201d. \u201cIt was Gloria Steinem that said that, by the way \u2013 that humour is the strongest tool \u2013 and it\u2019s true.\u201d </p> <p>However, the French feminist group Osez le F\u00e9minisme! strongly disagrees that sex work is empowering for women. \u201cThere is still work to do in France, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques, a spokesperson for the group. \u201cZahia Dehar is perhaps a particular case, but at least 90% of women in prostitution are forced into it; trafficked, held against their will and raped. There\u2019s a great difference between seduction and sexual violence, that has nothing to do with puritanism. It\u2019s a message we keep hammering home.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "A decade ago, Zahia Dehar, a French-Algerian teenager, woke up to find her picture on the front of France\u2019s newspapers as the underage girl caught up in a prostitution scandal involving members of the national football squad. She was an escort that star player Franck Rib\u00e9ry was said to have solicited as a \u201cbirthday present\u201d to himself. Aged 18 when the scandal broke \u2013 and just 17 at the time of the incident \u2013 Dehar seemed destined to be defined for life by the sordid story. But she refused to let it define her. For young woman, driven to thoughts of suicide, it was a question of survival. \u201cI had the choice between killing myself or going forward. I didn\u2019t want to kill myself,\u201d she said afterwards. Today, the 27-year-old model, lingerie designer and muse to the late couturier Karl Lagerfeld is celebrating her first film role and has found herself compared to a young Brigitte Bardot. In Une Fille Facile (An Easy Girl), released in France on Wednesday, Dehar plays the liberated Sofia, who sleeps with rich men who buy her gifts; it is set in a steamy summer in the south of France, featuring sun, sea, sand and sex, with luxury yachts and jewels thrown in. One reviewer said the film had a \u201cclassically Gallic nonchalance when it comes to sex\u201d. The French culture magazine Les Inrockuptibles ran a front page with the headline \u201cEt dieu cr\u00e9a Zahia\u201d (And God created Zahia), a reference to Roger Vadim\u2019s 1956 film And God Created Woman, which launched Bardot\u2019s career. \u201c\u2018An easy girl\u2019 is not pejorative: it\u2019s a woman who submerges herself in her sexuality like a man. It\u2019s rare to see a woman like Sofia celebrated like that,\u201d Dehar said. Born in Ghriss, Algeria, Dehar came to France at the age of 10 with her mother and younger brother after their parents\u2019 divorce. By the time she was 16, uninterested in boys her own age, she made a decision, she says, to sleep with older men for money. By night, she frequented high-class clubs in Paris, returning home in the early hours to change for school. The first her mother learned of it was when the scandal broke involving Rib\u00e9ry and Karim Benzema, the Real Madrid striker. \u201cShe heard about it on the television and was very shocked. But she was never aggressive with me. She was mostly worried,\u201d Dehar said. \u201cI was not in a good place until I told myself that what I did was not a crime.\u201d Rib\u00e9ry and Benzema were investigated and in 2014 the charges against them were dropped, with the judge ruling there was insufficient proof they had known Dehar was underage. Dehar says the affair still haunts her. \u201cI experienced it as a shock, a catastrophe \u2026 I had the feeling that my adult life had barely begun but had no future,\u201d she told Les Inrockuptibles. \u201cI felt trapped in a box, the box of banned, stoned women \u2026 I really felt very bad and I even thought of killing myself because I believed I no longer had a life. I felt as if I was a monster that had to be hidden.\u201d Later, Dehar told Antidote magazine: \u201cI was very ill, I didn\u2019t go out, I saw nobody \u2026 I was \u2018Zahia the whore\u2019. And I knew that, in society, that kind of woman is seen as diabolical.\u201d Instead of being ostracised, however, Dehar received modelling offers, inspired the artists Pierre et Gilles to portray her as Marianne, the feminine symbol of the French state, and was photographed by Lagerfeld, who supported a lingerie collection she launched. Some critics see art imitating life, describing Dehar\u2019s role in Une Fille Facile as that of a blank canvas on to which the men in the film project their fantasies, albeit tempered by her character\u2019s independence and wit. The film\u2019s writer and director, Rebecca Zlotowski, a founder member of the 50/50 collective \u2013 a French organisation set up in response to #MeToo that rejects the perceived \u201cAnglo-Saxon puritanism\u201d of the US-born movement \u2013 says her film is \u201can amoral summer story\u201d. Its subject is \u201cthe question of strength, power, domination in all fields\u201d, she says. \u201cTo be a feminist, you don\u2019t need to show female astronauts or neurosurgeons. I like to show women in extreme femininity,\u201d Zlotowski says. The film has highlighted again the contrary response in France to #MeToo. After the allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and rape against Harvey Weinstein, a number of high-profile French women, including the actress Catherine Deneuve, accused feminist campaigners of attacking men\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to hit on women. Zlotowski told the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cWe have a Latin culture that always feels a little bit threatened by American puritanism \u2026 [The French] want to keep their wild sexuality.\u201d She maintains the most powerful tools to combat sexism and misogyny are \u201ceconomics \u2026 and humour\u201d. \u201cIt was Gloria Steinem that said that, by the way \u2013 that humour is the strongest tool \u2013 and it\u2019s true.\u201d However, the French feminist group Osez le F\u00e9minisme! strongly disagrees that sex work is empowering for women. \u201cThere is still work to do in France, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques, a spokesperson for the group. \u201cZahia Dehar is perhaps a particular case, but at least 90% of women in prostitution are forced into it; trafficked, held against their will and raped. There\u2019s a great difference between seduction and sexual violence, that has nothing to do with puritanism. It\u2019s a message we keep hammering home.\u201d",

In Shane Taylor\u2019s street photographs of London, we see gentlemen in trilbys stalking around Mayfair and women with powdered faces and rouged cheeks staring imperiously out the windows of grand Piccadilly cafes. A cursory glance might date these images to the 1950s. Take a closer look, however, and you begin to spot telltale details: the white earbuds, the smartphones, the New Routemaster buses in the background. Taylor, whose work pays homage to such greats as Robert Frank and Sergio Larrain, says he was \u201ctrying to get the classic look I love from those older photographers by shooting with a certain type of film and camera, in areas of London where you still see people in suits and hats\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0e7fb7fbaa219bfd301d428152e97257d960d9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0e7fb7fbaa219bfd301d428152e97257d960d9f/0_0_3065_4597/667.jpg\" alt=\"Woman and a man in a car at Green Park.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woman and a man in a car at Green Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Taylor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raised in the midlands of Ireland, Taylor started taking photography seriously in his late 20s while studying visual communications in Dublin.

      "bodyText": "They could be snapshots of an earlier time. In Shane Taylor\u2019s street photographs of London, we see gentlemen in trilbys stalking around Mayfair and women with powdered faces and rouged cheeks staring imperiously out the windows of grand Piccadilly cafes. A cursory glance might date these images to the 1950s. Take a closer look, however, and you begin to spot telltale details: the white earbuds, the smartphones, the New Routemaster buses in the background. Taylor, whose work pays homage to such greats as Robert Frank and Sergio Larrain, says he was \u201ctrying to get the classic look I love from those older photographers by shooting with a certain type of film and camera, in areas of London where you still see people in suits and hats\u201d. Raised in the midlands of Ireland, Taylor started taking photography seriously in his late 20s while studying visual communications in Dublin. Nearly a decade later, in 2016, he launched an Instagram account, @heroesforsale, posting new work on a near-daily basis (he now has nearly 60,000 followers, impressive for an amateur street photographer).

      "body": "<p>After a while you get used to people wishing you dead. In my case it helps that the ones making the suggestion do so lightly. Often there\u2019s the catch of a laugh in their voice. It\u2019s that stifled amusement, the giggle before the darkness, which alerts me to what\u2019s coming. I am on stage in a small theatre or comedy club, the meat of my live show behind me, and I am taking questions. I am working my way from upstretched hand to upstretched hand, trying to be the most entertaining version of myself that I can. \u201cJay, so\u2026 Ha!\u201d Here we go. \u201cWhat would be your death-row dinner?\u201d The audience laughs. The audience always laughs. By asking the question the balance of power appears to have shifted, and brilliantly. There I am up on stage, owning the space. And now here\u2019s a member of the audience bringing me back down to earth by asking me to imagine I am about to be put to death for some crime of which I am obviously guilty. Then again, they have heard the question only once; I have heard it dozens of times. I reply. Some of the audience laugh. Some of them look puzzled. Others look utterly furious. As far as they\u2019re concerned, I really haven\u2019t played the game at all.</p> <p>The idea of last suppers, be they caused by the judicial system, suicide or misfortune of health, has long fascinated me. It seems such a simple question. You are about to die. What do you choose to eat? But it isn\u2019t simple at all. For a start, we eat to keep ourselves alive. That\u2019s the whole point of consuming food. It\u2019s literally a bodily function. But if you knew your death was imminent, the basic reason for the meal would have gone. You\u2019ll be long dead before you starve.</p> <p>So now it\u2019s about something else. Do you choose comfort food, something that reminds you of the good times when you weren\u2019t about to die? Do you allow your meal to parent you, to enfold you in the biggest hug possible? Or do you go for ingredients as statement? Should your last meal not be a time to wade into luxury and excess? And how big a part does memory play in all this? Those of us who are more obsessed with our lunch than is strictly necessary build our stories around mealtimes. We construct our narrative one plateful at a time. What\u2019s more, now we can eat what the hell we like because there are no consequences. Usually, too much deep-fried, sugar-rich food would result in you feeling queasy and worrying about your heart, about what type of person your appetites were turning you into. Now, who cares?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799b71d1d939659b0d979397924f477434cafceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799b71d1d939659b0d979397924f477434cafceb/0_0_6720_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feeling the chill: Oklahoma city bomber Timothy McVeigh\u2019s final meal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling the chill: Oklahoma city bomber Timothy McVeigh\u2019s final meal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Hargreaves</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there\u2019s a problem. Let\u2019s call it the mood issue. I am a man of appetites, but even I would be hard pushed to shove the thought of my impending death out of my head and get down to eating. Which is exactly what I tell the people who ask me about my death-row dinner. \u201cI might be a greedy bastard,\u201d I tell the audience, \u201cbut even I would lose my appetite if the next morning I was to be the victim of an appalling miscarriage of justice.\u201d They wanted an account of unfettered, careless indulgence. Instead I\u2019ve raised an issue of jurisprudence.</p> <p>In 2007 photographer Melanie Dunea published a book also called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/apr/10/thelastsupper\" title=\"\">My Last Supper</a></em>, in which 50 big-name chefs from around the world gave an account of what they would eat for their last meal on earth. They were then photographed looking thoughtful about their own mortality. In his introduction, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/anthony-bourdain-obituary\" title=\"\">Anthony Bourdain</a>, the one-time chef turned writer and broadcaster, explained that these were people who had already had the opportunity to eat anything and everything. You name it, they\u2019d almost certainly been served it. Hence, when asked to describe a final meal, these chefs would probably go after something that reminded them of leaner, simpler times before the glamour and pressure of superstardom. And there is a bit of that. Jamie Oliver chose spaghetti all\u2019arrabbiata. Gordon Ramsay wanted a roast Sunday lunch.</p> <p>But they are in the minority. For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/05/foodanddrink.restaurants\" title=\"\">Thomas Keller</a>, once regarded as the greatest chef in America for his nerdy, intense cooking at the French Laundry, wanted half a kilo of osetra caviar, then otoro, the hyper expensive fatty belly of the endangered bluefin tuna. He followed that with a roast chicken, which sounded rustic enough, but then he went all in with a brie with truffles. All of this was to be served with a 1983 vintage champagne.</p> <p>For a reality check you have to look at the work of the New Zealand-born photographer <a href=\"https://henryhargreaves.com/\" title=\"\">Henry Hargreaves</a>, an opponent of the death penalty. In 2013 he put together a portfolio of photographs recreating various real death-row dinners. Some seemed obvious. The serial killer John Wayne Gacy, convicted of 33 murders and executed by lethal injection in 1994, asked for fried shrimps and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Oklahoma bomber <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/06/mcveigh.usa\" title=\"\">Timothy McVeigh</a> went for a whole tub of mint chocolate ice-cream. These could indeed be interpreted as attempts by troubled adults to reach back to the innocent comforts of childhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4afa76f478bbc94b7005ba993270ccba6a2c0c6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4afa76f478bbc94b7005ba993270ccba6a2c0c6e/0_482_3826_6109/626.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When the moment to take my leave actually does come, I won\u2019t be left feeling that there\u2019s unfinished gastronomic business\u2019: Jay Rayner.\" width=\"626\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When the moment to take my leave actually does come, I won\u2019t be left feeling that there\u2019s unfinished gastronomic business\u2019: Jay Rayner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012 the academic journal <em><a href=\"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/appetite\" title=\"\">Appetite</a></em> published a paper analysing \u201cdeath row nutrition\u201d. The authors, Brian Wansink, Kevin Kniffin and Mitsuru Shimizu, looked at the contents of 247 last meals served in the US between 2002 and 2006, where the budget for the final meal ranged between $20 and $50, depending on the state. Some states allowed the food to be ordered in from nearby restaurants; others insisted it be made from what was in the prison store cupboard.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found the average meal was a hefty 2,756 calories, which is more than the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/food-and-diet/what-should-my-daily-intake-of-calories-be/\" title=\"\">recommended</a> daily intake for an adult male. The requests from death-row inmates in two states, Texas and Oklahoma, were for meals that were between 750 to 1,000 calories more than in most of the others. Four of them were 7,200 calories or more. (One person ordered a dozen pieces of fried chicken, two rolls with butter, mashed potato and gravy, two soft drinks, plus a pint each of strawberry and vanilla ice-cream.)</p> <p>More strikingly, the average meal had 2.5 times the daily recommended serving of protein and fat. Chicken was the most popular meat followed by both hamburger and steak. Nearly 70% wanted fried food. In pursuit of the familiar, there were a few requests for named brands. They wanted McDonald\u2019s and KFC. Coke was the drink of choice for 16% of those heading towards execution. Curiously, three of them wanted Diet Coke. Maybe they just liked the taste.</p> <p>There are other<em><strong> </strong></em>candidates<em><strong> </strong></em>for last meals. There are the suicidals, like Ernest Hemingway, who went for a New York strip steak, a baked potato, a Caesar salad and a glass of Bordeaux before shooting himself in the head. It sounds like a nice enough dinner, but is it unreasonable to suggest, given what he did afterwards, that this last meal was not an especially happy affair? Then there are the terminally ill. With the moment of death uncertain, timing is an issue, as is the ability to eat. Very few last meals eaten by the dying are like that served to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, the president of the French republic, who died of cancer in 1996. His last meal started with foie gras, oysters and capon, but all of that was merely an overture to the consumption of ortolan, a yellow-throated songbird, the eating of which was frowned upon by the majority of his fellow Frenchmen at the time and would eventually be made illegal.</p> <p>Even in a country that has always been ahead of the pack when it comes to ritualising dinner, the process of eating ortolan goes beyond what is strictly necessary. Traditionally, they should first be placed in the dark for a month, so that, thinking it is their night-time feeding period, they fatten themselves up. Next, they are drowned in Armagnac. Finally, they are roasted for eight minutes, plucked and eaten whole, head and all, the idea being that the sharp bones puncture the inside of the mouth so that the diner\u2019s blood mingles with that of the bird. You are supposed to eat them with a napkin over your head so that the Lord may not see your sin, or so your fellow diners may not see you spitting out the bones. One or the other.</p> <p>Which is more extraordinary: the details of the last meal or the fact that this was the last meal of an exceedingly ill man? Illness murders appetite. Medication blunts and steals taste buds. Entirely reasonable existential angst, a fear of the end, can fill the belly with nothing but lead. The grandiose Mitterrand might have been able to pull off this final, shameless flourish, but I suspect that, were I in that situation, I could not. Indeed, I\u2019m certain of it, because I am no stranger to near death experiences.</p> <p><em><strong>It is the summer </strong></em>of 1984. I am 17 and alone on a beach in Tangier, on Morocco\u2019s northern tip. The late afternoon is shading into dusk. I came here with six friends, our Interrail cards securing the 48-hour train journey from Florence to a town where impoverished backpackers can afford rooms in a four-star hotel on the beach. I feel intrepid. I have travelled. So why not travel a little more?</p> <p>While my friends explore the narrow alleys behind the hotel, I go alone to the beach. Bobbing on the steel-grey waters a little way offshore is a diving platform. What fun. I would go for a swim, a proper grown-up bit of exercise with a destination. I am 15 minutes into the swim when I realise the mistake I have made. The diving platform is much bigger than I had thought, which means perspective and distance have played their tricks. I have completely underestimated the length of the swim. It is a quarter of a mile from the beach, perhaps more. Currents are pulling in different directions. The waves are getting up as an evening breeze kicks in, and I am tiring quickly. But I am now closer to the platform than to the shore.</p> <p>I stop for a moment and tread water, looking back at the empty beach. Behind it, lights are coming on in the restaurants and bars that cluster the corniche. Life is continuing. Not a soul knows I am out here. I turn and push for the platform, and somehow, 10 minutes later, drag myself up on to it. I sit there shivering, despite the warmth of the North African winds, trying to drag air into my exhausted lungs and looking back at the beach.</p> <p>While I can see the people thronging the front, I can\u2019t hear them, which means they cannot hear me. I look around for any passing boats, but there are none. I have no choice. I take a deep breath, drop off the side of the platform and push for the shore. The waves are no longer a gentle bob and heave. They are peaks and troughs that make the beach disappear from view. I try to focus on the lights, the symbols of undramatic life continuing, but they are rising and falling as I do and disappearing behind walls of water that, at their tops, shade now into a sky fading to the colour of ink.</p> <p>All I can do is kick. And kick. And kick again. My legs are just one long length of cramping muscle. My shoulders are sore and with every third stroke I am getting a mouthful of water. My eyes sting and a nausea \u2013 part seawater, part fear \u2013 is closing my throat. Now there are only the lights and the surf and the sea and the wind and the salt and the words, \u201cNot like this.\u201d Twenty minutes later, my feet drag against the sandy seabed. Now the balls of my feet are digging in. I can hear the surf breaking on the beach. I crawl the last 5ft, clawing at the sand until I am up and out of the water. I turn and, in the darkness, drop on to my arse, my back to the corniche, looking out at the platform I have come from, my arms resting on my knees. I drop my head and sob.</p> <p>A lot of thoughts went through my head during this experience. There was the slow-motion terror of my fight against the waves. I thought about my parents and my friends. I thought about all the things I wanted to do and hadn\u2019t. However, not once did I think about food. Not once did I think, \u201cIf only I\u2019d eaten properly last night\u201d or \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was coming, I\u2019d have been more serious about dinner.\u201d And afterwards I didn\u2019t have much appetite either. A real brush with death can impact upon you in many ways. But take it from me \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make you hungry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51e5365a74dfc4a14b82970ebfafcb5484034ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51e5365a74dfc4a14b82970ebfafcb5484034ba2/0_0_8400_4800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heart of stone: the final meal requested by Victor Feguer, the last person to be executed in Iowa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heart of stone: the final meal requested by Victor Feguer, the last person to be executed in Iowa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Hargreaves</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bottom line is this: last suppers are a brilliant idea, but they are wasted on the very people who are eligible for them. The more I thought about this, the more it seemed to me extremely unfair. I was excluded from enjoying this blissful meal by the piffling detail of not actually being that close to death. And so I came up with a plan: I would stage my own last supper now, when I was fit and well and able to enjoy it. Because this really is the right time. While my own death may not be imminent, I have been forced in recent years to think about my mortality. This year marks my 20th anniversary as a restaurant critic. I have earned part of my living courtesy of thousands of meals, both expensive and less so. I have given my body to my job, and it hasn\u2019t always thanked me for it.</p> <p>But there are upsides, too, not least the massive privilege of having food memories that stretch across years and continents: some good, some bad, some bizarre, all of them perfect material from which to construct a final meal. The long service also means one thing: I am no longer a young man. It is not simply that my beard is the colour of roadside slush mid-thaw, that I am now beyond 50 and aware there is almost certainly less to go than there has been.</p> <p>Both my parents are gone. There is no one else in the waiting room ahead of me. I also have that other marker of adulthood, a family. This is surely the perfect moment in which to take stock. And how better to do so than by coming up with a definitive answer to the question I have been asked, and dodged, so many times? At least this way, when the moment to take my leave actually does come, I won\u2019t be left feeling that there\u2019s unfinished gastronomic business. I will have done the final meal properly.</p> <p>Much more importantly, though, the idea presented me with the opportunity to indulge in one of the rarely discussed pleasures of the table: anticipation. Anybody with even just a passing interest in lunch will have daydreamed about what it will be, thought in detail about the process of getting the ingredients, then preparing and cooking and bringing them to the table. With my plan to build and then serve my last supper I was giving myself the licence to dream. And not only dream. I would have to test and taste and test again. I would need a main course, but also something to start. And something to finish. There would be side dishes. And bread. And butter. The right kind of butter, the stuff you can eat neat without the support of bread. And wine. Quite a lot of wine. Quite a lot of different kinds of wine.</p> <p>But even dreamers need rules. I realised early on that the creation of my last meal would be the coming together of all my memories, hopes and appetites, shameful or otherwise. I was not creating the perfect meal. Perfection suggests balance and poise. I had no intention of being balanced and poised. I would be bloody outrageous and over the top. I would refuse to think about consequences or the next morning, for when you eat your last supper there isn\u2019t meant to be a next anything. In this I would be lying to myself, because of course I would live on, unless something went terribly wrong (or, depending on your point of view, terribly right). I wouldn\u2019t even be looking for the perfect ingredients. They might turn out to be so, but only accidentally. Or because I\u2019m burdened with exquisite taste.</p> <p>Happily, this journey could end only one way: with a set-piece meal surrounded by friends. It would be a major event. After all, how many dinners are there which, through each course, attempt to distil the memories of the person who organised it? Would it be a massively expanded version of Proust\u2019s madeleine, a journey through my life one course at a time? Or would it, like the banquet at the end of <em>La Grande Bouffe</em>, be a complete overload of fat, salt and sugar? Would it, in short, be an obscenity? Or would it simply be dinner? Indeed, is it even possible to capture the essence of one\u2019s life through food?</p> <p>The only way to find out was to start cooking.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What would you have for your final meal? <br>Share your thoughts in the comments below</strong></p></li> </ul> <p><em>Jay Rayner\u2019s book My Last Supper: One Meal, a Lifetime in the Making is published by Guardian Faber on 5 September at \u00a316.99, buy it from the <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-last-supper-9781783351466.html\" title=\"\">Guardian Bookshop</a> at \u00a311.99.

      "bodyText": "After a while you get used to people wishing you dead. In my case it helps that the ones making the suggestion do so lightly. Often there\u2019s the catch of a laugh in their voice. It\u2019s that stifled amusement, the giggle before the darkness, which alerts me to what\u2019s coming. I am on stage in a small theatre or comedy club, the meat of my live show behind me, and I am taking questions. I am working my way from upstretched hand to upstretched hand, trying to be the most entertaining version of myself that I can. \u201cJay, so\u2026 Ha!\u201d Here we go. \u201cWhat would be your death-row dinner?\u201d The audience laughs. The audience always laughs. By asking the question the balance of power appears to have shifted, and brilliantly. There I am up on stage, owning the space. And now here\u2019s a member of the audience bringing me back down to earth by asking me to imagine I am about to be put to death for some crime of which I am obviously guilty. Then again, they have heard the question only once; I have heard it dozens of times. I reply. Some of the audience laugh. Some of them look puzzled. Others look utterly furious. As far as they\u2019re concerned, I really haven\u2019t played the game at all. The idea of last suppers, be they caused by the judicial system, suicide or misfortune of health, has long fascinated me. It seems such a simple question. You are about to die. What do you choose to eat? But it isn\u2019t simple at all. For a start, we eat to keep ourselves alive. That\u2019s the whole point of consuming food. It\u2019s literally a bodily function. But if you knew your death was imminent, the basic reason for the meal would have gone. You\u2019ll be long dead before you starve. So now it\u2019s about something else. Do you choose comfort food, something that reminds you of the good times when you weren\u2019t about to die? Do you allow your meal to parent you, to enfold you in the biggest hug possible? Or do you go for ingredients as statement? Should your last meal not be a time to wade into luxury and excess? And how big a part does memory play in all this? Those of us who are more obsessed with our lunch than is strictly necessary build our stories around mealtimes. We construct our narrative one plateful at a time. What\u2019s more, now we can eat what the hell we like because there are no consequences. Usually, too much deep-fried, sugar-rich food would result in you feeling queasy and worrying about your heart, about what type of person your appetites were turning you into. Now, who cares? But there\u2019s a problem. Let\u2019s call it the mood issue. I am a man of appetites, but even I would be hard pushed to shove the thought of my impending death out of my head and get down to eating. Which is exactly what I tell the people who ask me about my death-row dinner. \u201cI might be a greedy bastard,\u201d I tell the audience, \u201cbut even I would lose my appetite if the next morning I was to be the victim of an appalling miscarriage of justice.\u201d They wanted an account of unfettered, careless indulgence. Instead I\u2019ve raised an issue of jurisprudence. In 2007 photographer Melanie Dunea published a book also called My Last Supper, in which 50 big-name chefs from around the world gave an account of what they would eat for their last meal on earth. They were then photographed looking thoughtful about their own mortality. In his introduction, the late Anthony Bourdain, the one-time chef turned writer and broadcaster, explained that these were people who had already had the opportunity to eat anything and everything. You name it, they\u2019d almost certainly been served it. Hence, when asked to describe a final meal, these chefs would probably go after something that reminded them of leaner, simpler times before the glamour and pressure of superstardom. And there is a bit of that. Jamie Oliver chose spaghetti all\u2019arrabbiata. Gordon Ramsay wanted a roast Sunday lunch. But they are in the minority. For example, Thomas Keller, once regarded as the greatest chef in America for his nerdy, intense cooking at the French Laundry, wanted half a kilo of osetra caviar, then otoro, the hyper expensive fatty belly of the endangered bluefin tuna. He followed that with a roast chicken, which sounded rustic enough, but then he went all in with a brie with truffles. All of this was to be served with a 1983 vintage champagne. For a reality check you have to look at the work of the New Zealand-born photographer Henry Hargreaves, an opponent of the death penalty. In 2013 he put together a portfolio of photographs recreating various real death-row dinners. Some seemed obvious. The serial killer John Wayne Gacy, convicted of 33 murders and executed by lethal injection in 1994, asked for fried shrimps and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh went for a whole tub of mint chocolate ice-cream. These could indeed be interpreted as attempts by troubled adults to reach back to the innocent comforts of childhood. In 2012 the academic journal Appetite published a paper analysing \u201cdeath row nutrition\u201d. The authors, Brian Wansink, Kevin Kniffin and Mitsuru Shimizu, looked at the contents of 247 last meals served in the US between 2002 and 2006, where the budget for the final meal ranged between $20 and $50, depending on the state. Some states allowed the food to be ordered in from nearby restaurants; others insisted it be made from what was in the prison store cupboard. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found the average meal was a hefty 2,756 calories, which is more than the recommended daily intake for an adult male. The requests from death-row inmates in two states, Texas and Oklahoma, were for meals that were between 750 to 1,000 calories more than in most of the others. Four of them were 7,200 calories or more. (One person ordered a dozen pieces of fried chicken, two rolls with butter, mashed potato and gravy, two soft drinks, plus a pint each of strawberry and vanilla ice-cream.) More strikingly, the average meal had 2.5 times the daily recommended serving of protein and fat. Chicken was the most popular meat followed by both hamburger and steak. Nearly 70% wanted fried food. In pursuit of the familiar, there were a few requests for named brands. They wanted McDonald\u2019s and KFC. Coke was the drink of choice for 16% of those heading towards execution. Curiously, three of them wanted Diet Coke. Maybe they just liked the taste. There are other candidates for last meals. There are the suicidals, like Ernest Hemingway, who went for a New York strip steak, a baked potato, a Caesar salad and a glass of Bordeaux before shooting himself in the head. It sounds like a nice enough dinner, but is it unreasonable to suggest, given what he did afterwards, that this last meal was not an especially happy affair? Then there are the terminally ill. With the moment of death uncertain, timing is an issue, as is the ability to eat. Very few last meals eaten by the dying are like that served to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, the president of the French republic, who died of cancer in 1996. His last meal started with foie gras, oysters and capon, but all of that was merely an overture to the consumption of ortolan, a yellow-throated songbird, the eating of which was frowned upon by the majority of his fellow Frenchmen at the time and would eventually be made illegal. Even in a country that has always been ahead of the pack when it comes to ritualising dinner, the process of eating ortolan goes beyond what is strictly necessary. Traditionally, they should first be placed in the dark for a month, so that, thinking it is their night-time feeding period, they fatten themselves up. Next, they are drowned in Armagnac. Finally, they are roasted for eight minutes, plucked and eaten whole, head and all, the idea being that the sharp bones puncture the inside of the mouth so that the diner\u2019s blood mingles with that of the bird. You are supposed to eat them with a napkin over your head so that the Lord may not see your sin, or so your fellow diners may not see you spitting out the bones. One or the other. Which is more extraordinary: the details of the last meal or the fact that this was the last meal of an exceedingly ill man? Illness murders appetite. Medication blunts and steals taste buds. Entirely reasonable existential angst, a fear of the end, can fill the belly with nothing but lead. The grandiose Mitterrand might have been able to pull off this final, shameless flourish, but I suspect that, were I in that situation, I could not. Indeed, I\u2019m certain of it, because I am no stranger to near death experiences. It is the summer of 1984. I am 17 and alone on a beach in Tangier, on Morocco\u2019s northern tip. The late afternoon is shading into dusk. I came here with six friends, our Interrail cards securing the 48-hour train journey from Florence to a town where impoverished backpackers can afford rooms in a four-star hotel on the beach. I feel intrepid. I have travelled. So why not travel a little more? While my friends explore the narrow alleys behind the hotel, I go alone to the beach. Bobbing on the steel-grey waters a little way offshore is a diving platform. What fun. I would go for a swim, a proper grown-up bit of exercise with a destination. I am 15 minutes into the swim when I realise the mistake I have made. The diving platform is much bigger than I had thought, which means perspective and distance have played their tricks. I have completely underestimated the length of the swim. It is a quarter of a mile from the beach, perhaps more. Currents are pulling in different directions. The waves are getting up as an evening breeze kicks in, and I am tiring quickly. But I am now closer to the platform than to the shore. I stop for a moment and tread water, looking back at the empty beach. Behind it, lights are coming on in the restaurants and bars that cluster the corniche. Life is continuing. Not a soul knows I am out here. I turn and push for the platform, and somehow, 10 minutes later, drag myself up on to it. I sit there shivering, despite the warmth of the North African winds, trying to drag air into my exhausted lungs and looking back at the beach. While I can see the people thronging the front, I can\u2019t hear them, which means they cannot hear me. I look around for any passing boats, but there are none. I have no choice. I take a deep breath, drop off the side of the platform and push for the shore. The waves are no longer a gentle bob and heave. They are peaks and troughs that make the beach disappear from view. I try to focus on the lights, the symbols of undramatic life continuing, but they are rising and falling as I do and disappearing behind walls of water that, at their tops, shade now into a sky fading to the colour of ink. All I can do is kick. And kick. And kick again. My legs are just one long length of cramping muscle. My shoulders are sore and with every third stroke I am getting a mouthful of water. My eyes sting and a nausea \u2013 part seawater, part fear \u2013 is closing my throat. Now there are only the lights and the surf and the sea and the wind and the salt and the words, \u201cNot like this.\u201d Twenty minutes later, my feet drag against the sandy seabed. Now the balls of my feet are digging in. I can hear the surf breaking on the beach. I crawl the last 5ft, clawing at the sand until I am up and out of the water. I turn and, in the darkness, drop on to my arse, my back to the corniche, looking out at the platform I have come from, my arms resting on my knees. I drop my head and sob. A lot of thoughts went through my head during this experience. There was the slow-motion terror of my fight against the waves. I thought about my parents and my friends. I thought about all the things I wanted to do and hadn\u2019t. However, not once did I think about food. Not once did I think, \u201cIf only I\u2019d eaten properly last night\u201d or \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was coming, I\u2019d have been more serious about dinner.\u201d And afterwards I didn\u2019t have much appetite either. A real brush with death can impact upon you in many ways. But take it from me \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make you hungry. The bottom line is this: last suppers are a brilliant idea, but they are wasted on the very people who are eligible for them. The more I thought about this, the more it seemed to me extremely unfair. I was excluded from enjoying this blissful meal by the piffling detail of not actually being that close to death. And so I came up with a plan: I would stage my own last supper now, when I was fit and well and able to enjoy it. Because this really is the right time. While my own death may not be imminent, I have been forced in recent years to think about my mortality. This year marks my 20th anniversary as a restaurant critic. I have earned part of my living courtesy of thousands of meals, both expensive and less so. I have given my body to my job, and it hasn\u2019t always thanked me for it. But there are upsides, too, not least the massive privilege of having food memories that stretch across years and continents: some good, some bad, some bizarre, all of them perfect material from which to construct a final meal. The long service also means one thing: I am no longer a young man. It is not simply that my beard is the colour of roadside slush mid-thaw, that I am now beyond 50 and aware there is almost certainly less to go than there has been. Both my parents are gone. There is no one else in the waiting room ahead of me. I also have that other marker of adulthood, a family. This is surely the perfect moment in which to take stock. And how better to do so than by coming up with a definitive answer to the question I have been asked, and dodged, so many times? At least this way, when the moment to take my leave actually does come, I won\u2019t be left feeling that there\u2019s unfinished gastronomic business. I will have done the final meal properly. Much more importantly, though, the idea presented me with the opportunity to indulge in one of the rarely discussed pleasures of the table: anticipation. Anybody with even just a passing interest in lunch will have daydreamed about what it will be, thought in detail about the process of getting the ingredients, then preparing and cooking and bringing them to the table. With my plan to build and then serve my last supper I was giving myself the licence to dream. And not only dream. I would have to test and taste and test again. I would need a main course, but also something to start. And something to finish. There would be side dishes. And bread. And butter. The right kind of butter, the stuff you can eat neat without the support of bread. And wine. Quite a lot of wine. Quite a lot of different kinds of wine. But even dreamers need rules. I realised early on that the creation of my last meal would be the coming together of all my memories, hopes and appetites, shameful or otherwise. I was not creating the perfect meal. Perfection suggests balance and poise. I had no intention of being balanced and poised. I would be bloody outrageous and over the top.

      "body": "<p>\u201cPolitics are so obtrusive here.\u201d The great Irish playwright Brian Friel (1929-2015) was being interviewed in the Guildhall in Derry in 1980. Gesturing to the Ebrington barracks beyond the window, on the other side of the River Foyle, he continued: \u201cFor people like ourselves... definitions of identity have to be developed and analysed much more frequently [than in England]. We\u2019ve got to keep questioning until we find... some kind of generosity that can embrace the whole island.\u201d</p> <p>The cross-border <a href=\"http://www.artsoverborders.com/\" title=\"\">FrielFest,</a> now in its fourth year, invites audiences to participate in both the questioning and the embrace. In doing so, it reflects Friel\u2019s own strength \u2013 making works particular to time and place that express our universal experiences. The quest for answers to shifting questions is reflected in the peripatetic form of the festival, with dramatic readings of Friel\u2019s works presented in and around Derry and Donegal \u2013 and audiences, on occasion, visiting multiple venues in the course of one performance.</p> <p>First produced in 1973, <strong><a href=\"http://www.artsoverborders.com/programme/the-freedom-of-the-city-by-brian-friel-2019/\" title=\"\">The Freedom of the City</a></strong> is set in Derry\u2019s Guildhall, where, poignantly, this production is staged. A few hundred yards away, people are gathering around a makeshift music stage to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Bogside. On the night I attend, the audience meets outside the <a href=\"https://www.museumoffreederry.org/\" title=\"\">Museum of Free Derry</a> (on other evenings, the rendezvous point is the Ebrington barracks). We are sung to the Guildhall by Nigerian-born, Liverpool-based performer and playwright Tayo Aluko, and walk in the wake of his resonant spirituals. Where some of us see city streets, others see invisible barriers crumbled (\u201cI would never have crossed this road when I was young,\u201d says one). The play is partially based on events around 1972\u2019s Bloody Sunday. Its action unfurls in double-time. The fictional experiences of three civil rights demonstrators, who stumble into the Guildhall, fleeing a tear gas onslaught, are interspersed with the official inquiry into their subsequent deaths (shot leaving the building by the army, which maintains they were armed terrorists).</p> <p>Friel\u2019s evocation of ordinary people crushed by intransigent authority is deeply moving and thought-provoking wherever it is played. In this specific site, directed by Jonathan Moore as a performed reading with a cast of 12, it\u2019s spine-tingling. (Special mention to the three leads: Conor O\u2019Kane and Stephen Bradley as Skinner and Michael, respectively, twentysomething and unemployed; and, in particular, Siobhan McSweeney\u2019s layered and textured Lily, a cleaner and mother of 11.)</p> <p>The Good Friday agreement of 1998 officially ended the Troubles but, as recent events demonstrate, troubles continue. A special performance by <a href=\"https://www.kabosh.net/\" title=\"\">Kabosh</a> theatre company of Friel\u2019s first published play, <strong><a href=\"https://www.millenniumforum.co.uk/shows/the-enemy-within/\" title=\"\">The Enemy Within</a></strong>, imagining St Columba\u2019s personal spiritual struggles to free himself from the demands of clan and country, is dedicated to the memory of the author and journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/lyra-mckee\" title=\"\">Lyra McKee</a>. It\u2019s performed by an all-female cast in St Mary\u2019s church, Creggan, the area of Derry where McKee was shot by a gunman from the New IRA during riots this April. The church acoustics work against the cast but do not diminish the power of the script-in-hand production, which is further energised, between the acts, by Ruby Philogene\u2019s haunting renditions of spirituals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3073a521ddcb976f38f99cb1194b233e4d4a9dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3073a521ddcb976f38f99cb1194b233e4d4a9dc/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amelia Bullmore (Grace) in Brian Friel\u2019s Faith Healer in Portnoo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amelia Bullmore (Grace) in Brian Friel\u2019s Faith Healer in Portnoo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Andrews</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the border in Donegal, each of <strong><a href=\"http://www.artsoverborders.com/programme/faith-healer-by-brian-friel-2019/\" title=\"\">Faith Healer</a></strong>\u2019s four acts is performed in a separate location. The audience is bussed between them, starting and concluding in Glenties, said to be the model for Friel\u2019s fictional Ballybeg, and site of the play\u2019s fateful culmination. At Edeninfagh Glen, we are addressed by the titular \u201chero\u201d, Frank (Paul McGann); at Portnoo, Frank\u2019s wife, Grace (Amelia Bullmore), recounts events from a different angle; at Ardara, Teddy (Pearce Quigley), the manager who accompanies the couple on their tours of village halls in Scotland and Wales, gives his version. Seeming facts shift with each telling. The only thing on which all agree is an intangible: Frank is able to heal the sick \u2013 but cannot predict when or how. With no director and no rehearsals, reading from scripts, each actor addresses us with a barrier-breaking intimacy. Voyaging between acts, this quality of closeness carries over into the buses, as people share their responses (and their umbrellas, hunching through driving rain to an interval barbecue on Portnoo\u2019s pier, where waves spume above the stone wall and youths leap from it into the aquamarine Atlantic).

      "bodyText": "\u201cPolitics are so obtrusive here.\u201d The great Irish playwright Brian Friel (1929-2015) was being interviewed in the Guildhall in Derry in 1980. Gesturing to the Ebrington barracks beyond the window, on the other side of the River Foyle, he continued: \u201cFor people like ourselves... definitions of identity have to be developed and analysed much more frequently [than in England]. We\u2019ve got to keep questioning until we find... some kind of generosity that can embrace the whole island.\u201d The cross-border FrielFest, now in its fourth year, invites audiences to participate in both the questioning and the embrace. In doing so, it reflects Friel\u2019s own strength \u2013 making works particular to time and place that express our universal experiences. The quest for answers to shifting questions is reflected in the peripatetic form of the festival, with dramatic readings of Friel\u2019s works presented in and around Derry and Donegal \u2013 and audiences, on occasion, visiting multiple venues in the course of one performance. First produced in 1973, The Freedom of the City is set in Derry\u2019s Guildhall, where, poignantly, this production is staged. A few hundred yards away, people are gathering around a makeshift music stage to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Bogside. On the night I attend, the audience meets outside the Museum of Free Derry (on other evenings, the rendezvous point is the Ebrington barracks). We are sung to the Guildhall by Nigerian-born, Liverpool-based performer and playwright Tayo Aluko, and walk in the wake of his resonant spirituals. Where some of us see city streets, others see invisible barriers crumbled (\u201cI would never have crossed this road when I was young,\u201d says one). The play is partially based on events around 1972\u2019s Bloody Sunday. Its action unfurls in double-time. The fictional experiences of three civil rights demonstrators, who stumble into the Guildhall, fleeing a tear gas onslaught, are interspersed with the official inquiry into their subsequent deaths (shot leaving the building by the army, which maintains they were armed terrorists). Friel\u2019s evocation of ordinary people crushed by intransigent authority is deeply moving and thought-provoking wherever it is played. In this specific site, directed by Jonathan Moore as a performed reading with a cast of 12, it\u2019s spine-tingling. (Special mention to the three leads: Conor O\u2019Kane and Stephen Bradley as Skinner and Michael, respectively, twentysomething and unemployed; and, in particular, Siobhan McSweeney\u2019s layered and textured Lily, a cleaner and mother of 11.) The Good Friday agreement of 1998 officially ended the Troubles but, as recent events demonstrate, troubles continue. A special performance by Kabosh theatre company of Friel\u2019s first published play, The Enemy Within, imagining St Columba\u2019s personal spiritual struggles to free himself from the demands of clan and country, is dedicated to the memory of the author and journalist Lyra McKee. It\u2019s performed by an all-female cast in St Mary\u2019s church, Creggan, the area of Derry where McKee was shot by a gunman from the New IRA during riots this April. The church acoustics work against the cast but do not diminish the power of the script-in-hand production, which is further energised, between the acts, by Ruby Philogene\u2019s haunting renditions of spirituals. Over the border in Donegal, each of Faith Healer\u2019s four acts is performed in a separate location. The audience is bussed between them, starting and concluding in Glenties, said to be the model for Friel\u2019s fictional Ballybeg, and site of the play\u2019s fateful culmination. At Edeninfagh Glen, we are addressed by the titular \u201chero\u201d, Frank (Paul McGann); at Portnoo, Frank\u2019s wife, Grace (Amelia Bullmore), recounts events from a different angle; at Ardara, Teddy (Pearce Quigley), the manager who accompanies the couple on their tours of village halls in Scotland and Wales, gives his version. Seeming facts shift with each telling. The only thing on which all agree is an intangible: Frank is able to heal the sick \u2013 but cannot predict when or how. With no director and no rehearsals, reading from scripts, each actor addresses us with a barrier-breaking intimacy. Voyaging between acts, this quality of closeness carries over into the buses, as people share their responses (and their umbrellas, hunching through driving rain to an interval barbecue on Portnoo\u2019s pier, where waves spume above the stone wall and youths leap from it into the aquamarine Atlantic). We become bound into community in the space of the afternoon. The following evening we\u2019re under canvas, looking out over Donegal\u2019s Lough Swilly. In Homer By the Sea, Greta Scacchi reads to us of Odysseus\u2019s faithful dog, Argos, stirring at the sound of his returning master\u2019s long-unheard voice. Beyond her, a group crosses Rathmullan beach, dog loping beside them. Great stories reflect our shared joys and sorrows; they embrace us all, across time and space.",

      "body": "<p>At the memorial service given for Denis Compton in 1997, the great England cricketer\u2019s former county captain delivered a eulogy. In it, JJ Warr regaled the Westminster Abbey congregation with tales of sporting derring-do, but also talked about the off-field work ethic of his old friend during the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2009/apr/16/past-conservatives\" title=\"\">three-day week in 1974</a>. Warr recalled asking Compton what he thought of Ted Heath\u2019s new regime, when the batsman supposedly replied: \u201cI am not going to work an extra day for anybody.\u201d</p> <p>The tale is an obvious favourite among Lord\u2019s members during those brief passages of play when consciousness calls. But what is rarely discussed is how the anecdote suggests there was an extra talent in Compton\u2019s locker, aside from the colossal sporting gifts that brought him a Test batting average of 50, league and FA Cup winners\u2019 medals with Arsenal, and a putative world record for running out teammates.

      "bodyText": "At the memorial service given for Denis Compton in 1997, the great England cricketer\u2019s former county captain delivered a eulogy. In it, JJ Warr regaled the Westminster Abbey congregation with tales of sporting derring-do, but also talked about the off-field work ethic of his old friend during the introduction of the three-day week in 1974. Warr recalled asking Compton what he thought of Ted Heath\u2019s new regime, when the batsman supposedly replied: \u201cI am not going to work an extra day for anybody.\u201d The tale is an obvious favourite among Lord\u2019s members during those brief passages of play when consciousness calls. But what is rarely discussed is how the anecdote suggests there was an extra talent in Compton\u2019s locker, aside from the colossal sporting gifts that brought him a Test batting average of 50, league and FA Cup winners\u2019 medals with Arsenal, and a putative world record for running out teammates. Compton, it seems, may also have been ahead of his time as a right-on, left-leaning economist. The debate about the economic effects of shortened working weeks will re-emerge over the next few days with Monday\u2019s bank holiday \u2013 a collective day off that often provokes missives from right-of-centre thinktanks about how much these jollies cost the nation in lost GDP. In 2012, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimated the average bank holiday left the UK with a bill for \u00a32.3bn and asked: \u201cDo we really need so many?\u201d The answer to that question appears to be: yes. Or, at least, more paid days off may stop UK workers being so stubbornly unproductive. Analysis in 2017 by the economics blog Stumbling and Mumbling suggested that, across 35 OECD nations, there was a strong correlation between countries working less and being more productive. Earlier this month, the New Economics Foundation also argued that giving workers more paid holiday would help drive up spending power in the whole economy and could give firms a greater incentive to raise their productivity, as confidence about demand increased. Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the NEF, said: \u201cFor 10 years the UK has been trying to fix the productivity puzzle on the supply side \u2013 the way we make things, rather than the level and nature of our spending. But it looks as though the demand side accounts for up to half of the collapse in productivity growth we\u2019ve seen since the financial crisis. \u201cRaising demand by giving people more paid time off to spend their wages should be part of solving the UK\u2019s productivity problem.\u201d Douglas McWilliams, the deputy chairman of the CEBR, reckons the effects on GDP of bank holidays are now much lower than the \u00a32.3bn his firm estimated in 2012, as we have fewer factories that shut for the day and work is more flexible. He has even written about how we work 10% more than the Dutch, but have a lower GDP per capita than the Netherlands, and reckons an increase in our productivity could pay for more days off. Still, McWilliams warns that more unpaid \u2013 rather than paid \u2013 time off work would result in a lower tax take, which brings us back to another Compton story of unremunerated downtime. The cricketer used to dump unopened letters in a suitcase and when a friend did him the favour of opening the mail, two notes from a national newspaper were unearthed: the first offering Compton a lucrative column, the second withdrawing it because he\u2019d failed to reply.",

With Annie Lennox the conversation quickly moved into deeper waters: solitude, not belonging, adapting to survive as a gifted, working-class child. It was riveting stuff that Porter instinctively connected with (\u201cIt\u2019s something the black people do, that we have to do in order to traverse the terrain of American life\u201d). Deep easy listening.</p> <p>The big radio event of the week was Timberlake Wertenbaker\u2019s dramatisation of Proust\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0007wkz\" title=\"\">In Search of Lost Time</a></strong>, the French literary classic condensed to a mere 10 hours and featuring the quintessentially English voices of Derek Jacobi, Simon Russell Beale and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/27/frances-barber-interview-musik-pet-shop-boys-edinburgh\" title=\"\">Frances Barber</a>. On the evidence of the first instalment, the act of listening to, rather than reading, those elaborately elongated sentences has the magical effect of making them seem much shorter.

Inevitably, Brexit loomed large in their thoughts and with it the possibility of a hard border. \u201cI have this deep unease that we could be plunged back through a mixture of British carelessness and nationalist impetuosity,\u201d elaborated Keane. In that, he is not alone. The Hang podcast does what it says on the label, the supremely affable jazz singer Gregory Porter hanging out and hanging loose with a like-minded guest with often surprising results. With saxophonist Kamasi Washington there was an immediate and deep connection that harked back to their shared gospel background. With Annie Lennox the conversation quickly moved into deeper waters: solitude, not belonging, adapting to survive as a gifted, working-class child. It was riveting stuff that Porter instinctively connected with (\u201cIt\u2019s something the black people do, that we have to do in order to traverse the terrain of American life\u201d). Deep easy listening. The big radio event of the week was Timberlake Wertenbaker\u2019s dramatisation of Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time, the French literary classic condensed to a mere 10 hours and featuring the quintessentially English voices of Derek Jacobi, Simon Russell Beale and Frances Barber. On the evidence of the first instalment, the act of listening to, rather than reading, those elaborately elongated sentences has the magical effect of making them seem much shorter. This is a blessing, but not even Jacobi\u2019s dulcet delivery could endear me to the neurotically nostalgic narrator and his lost world of privilege. There were passages of luminous recall, of course, but on balance I\u2019m still siding with Germaine Greer, who defiantly equated temps perdu with time wasted \u2013 \u201ctime that would be better spent visiting a demented relative, meditating, walking the dog or learning ancient Greek\u201d.",

Hang your boots at the traditional Old Water View Hotel in Patterdale, a village noted by Wainwright for its \u201cmagnificence\u201d and by walkers for the well-stocked Village Store.

Typically tackled in five stages, from south to north, Langdale in the Central Lakes makes for a wonderful stopover. Pye Howe cottage is a fairytale 17th-century cottage with garden to match.

One such is the quintessential seaside resort of Ilfracombe, North Devon, from which you can walk to Woolacombe and Croyde, two jaw-dropping surfers\u2019 beaches. Stay at homely Harbour View, a Victorian terrace property, and enjoy sundowners in its smart first-floor drawing room that offers unbeatable views of Ilfracombe\u2019s natural harbour, quaint quayside and Damien Hirst\u2019s huge sculpture, Verity.

Rooms from \u00a345 per person per night (inveroran.com) The Thames Path, 184 miles If hills aren\u2019t your thing, follow in Charles Dickens\u2019s footsteps and explore the marshy eastern reaches of the Thames, then head upriver to its source, near Kemble, Gloucestershire. You can walk the whole thing in 12 to 14 days. Overnight in a shepherd\u2019s hut at Manor Farm B&amp;B in the lovely village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire. William Morris summered in nearby Kelmscott Manor, describing the spot as \u201cheaven on earth\u201d. Closer to the Great Wen, the stylish Bingham Riverhouse in Richmond offers copper bath tubs and views of the river. Stay: Manor Farm B&amp;B Kelmscott, Oxfordshire. Double rooms from \u00a385 per night (kelmscottbandb.co.uk/bed-and-breakfast). Bingham Riverhouse Richmond, Surrey. Double rooms from \u00a3144 per night (binghamriverhouse.com) The Cateran Trail, 64 miles Fear not: the piratical cattle thieves after whom this circular walk is named no longer lurk in the glens and moorlands, leaving the intermediate trail ripe for the hiking. Opportunities to spot wildlife are frequent along the signposted tracks, as are opportunities to hunt down a pub lunch. Find a whisky awaiting you along the way in the airy Kirkmichael Hotel in Kirkmichael or spend the night at hide-cum-glamping hut The Hideaway, just off the Trail\u2019s footpath on family-owned Bamff farm, near Alyth. This off-grid wonder overlooks two beaver ponds and a beaver dam. Stay: Kirkmichael Hotel Blairgowrie, Perthshire. Double rooms from \u00a385 per night (kirkmichaelhotel.co.uk). The Bamff Hideaway Alyth, Perthshire, from \u00a370 per night for minimum 2-night stay (bamff.co.uk) The Coast to Coast Walk, 182 miles Devised by fell walker Alfred Wainwright, guide and author of what he called his \u201clove letters\u201d to the Lakeland fells, the west to east coast (reversible) route starts at St Bees in Cumbria. It was conceived as a two-week walk, three if you ease your pace, and ends in the old fishing village of Robin Hood\u2019s Bay in North Yorkshire. Hang your boots at the traditional Old Water View Hotel in Patterdale, a village noted by Wainwright for its \u201cmagnificence\u201d and by walkers for the well-stocked Village Store. It sits at the southern end of Ullswater in the Lake District and is flanked by Helvellyn. If you make it to the finishing post, rest up at the rather swanky Boggle Hole Youth Hostel, hidden away in a smuggler\u2019s cove. Stay: The Old Water View Hotel Patterdale, Cumbria. Double rooms from \u00a378 per night (oldwaterview.co.uk). YHA Boggle Hole Robin\u2019s Hood Bay, North Yorks.

The scenery is heart-soaring and majestic, and there is a trail for everyone, with Stake Pass the only unavoidable mountain \u2013 or rather steep incline, at 480m \u2013 to climb. Typically tackled in five stages, from south to north, Langdale in the Central Lakes makes for a wonderful stopover. Pye Howe cottage is a fairytale 17th-century cottage with garden to match. Alternatively, enjoy Armathwaite Hall Hotel and Spa on Bassenthwaite Lake, a stately home in 4,000 acres flanked by the fells and Skiddaw mountain. Stay: Pye Howe cottage Great Langdale, Cumbria.

Double rooms from \u00a3125 (armathwaite-hall.com) South West Coast Path, 630 miles Created by coastguards to spot smugglers, the South West Coast Path is the longest national trail in the country. It stretches from Minehead in Somerset across the coast of Exmoor to Penzance before looping east, finishing at Poole Harbour in Dorset. There are more than 400 short walks on the route, so plump for a picturesque base and do day walks from there. One such is the quintessential seaside resort of Ilfracombe, North Devon, from which you can walk to Woolacombe and Croyde, two jaw-dropping surfers\u2019 beaches. Stay at homely Harbour View, a Victorian terrace property, and enjoy sundowners in its smart first-floor drawing room that offers unbeatable views of Ilfracombe\u2019s natural harbour, quaint quayside and Damien Hirst\u2019s huge sculpture, Verity. Or, for a traditional Cornish farmhouse with sea views, rest up at Mowhay, hidden in the hamlet of Gwendra on the Roseland Peninsula. Stay: Harbour View Ilfracombe, Devon. Sleeps six; three-night stay from \u00a3533 (holidaycottages.co.uk). Mowhay Gwendra, Cornwall.

It takes a hearty 12 days to complete, or five if you\u2019re a fell runner \u2013 which you probably aren\u2019t if you choose to break the journey at Pen-y-Dyffryn Country Hotel, a dangerously relaxing Georgian rectory turned peaceful retreat in the Shropshire hills a mile from the Offa\u2019s Dyke trail. Alternatively, keep in touch with nature in the decked-out yurts at Barnutopia in Shropshire. Stay: Pen-y-Dyffryn Country Hotel Rhydycroesau, Shropshire.

Stretching east to west across Northern Ireland\u2019s northerly coast, this two- to three-day walk starts in the Victorian seaside resort of Portstewart and ends in Ballycastle. Spend the night at Strand House B&amp;B, then explore various Game of Thrones locations. Alternatively, try the panoramic Kinbane Self-Catering Cottages perched on a headland and boasting smart interiors and views over Kinbane Castle and across to Islay and Jura.

It was bound to happen. I loved the first series (adapted by Joe Penhall from John E Douglas\u2019s 1995 book, with David Fincher as executive producer), which detailed the creation of the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit, where the gifted but stiff Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff), his gruff partner, Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), and icily astute Wendy Carr (Anna Torv) probed real-life serial killers such as the monstrous and monstrously articulate \u201cCo-ed Killer\u201d, Ed Kemper (Cameron Britton), in the hope of catching more.</p> <p>The new series opened with Ford (whose character is based on Douglas) recovering from a breakdown provoked by a close encounter with Kemper. The team, now housed in a larger, swankier basement (still a metaphor for the depths of the human psyche), have a supportive but sly, ladder-climbing new boss (Michael Cerveris), and the task of solving the Atlanta child murders (28 black people, mainly children, killed between 1979 and 1981) in a climate of heightened racial tension.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there are serial killer \u201cstar turns\u201d from the likes of \u201cSon of Sam\u201d David Berkowitz (Oliver Cooper) and Charles Manson (Damon Herriman, who also plays the venal, drivel-spouting hippy in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <em>Once Upon </em><em>a Time </em><em>in Hollywood</em>). <em>Mindhunter</em> has always been as much about the troubled hunters as the hunted, and this second series features a disturbing backstory for Tench (his adopted son gets caught up in a child-murder), Carr embarking upon a doomed lesbian love affair and becoming sidelined in the workplace, and Ford\u2019s mental health continuing to fray like pulled threads on an expensive suit.</p> <p>Once again, the series boasts stellar performances, the Ford/Tench odd-couple dynamic grating and sparking at the centre, with stylish adventurous shooting from the moody grey-blue palette of the FBI offices, to the cheesy cop-show graphics heralding new locations. The \u201cBTK\u201d (\u201cbind, torture, kill\u201d)-strangler plot from the first series is still there, as a teasing background hum. Needless to say I\u2019ve already booked the sofa for the season three binge. While <em>Mindhunter</em> exploits society\u2019s obsession with scary monsters \u2013 that indefensible yet commonplace notion of serial killers as celebrities \u2013 it manages to remain rooted in history and research, and thus in exploration rather than celebration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"094a6fc19f17e4f6fe0b5b45affcfc9d944147e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/094a6fc19f17e4f6fe0b5b45affcfc9d944147e7/0_119_3125_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Online fantasy crashes into real-life misery\u2019: Hunter Schafer and Zendaya in Euphoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Online fantasy crashes into real-life misery\u2019: Hunter Schafer and Zendaya in Euphoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to see how Sam Levinson\u2019s explicit teen drama <strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/Euphoria\" title=\"\">Euphoria</a></strong> (originally an Israeli show) caused mass parental panic in the States. With its depictions of sex, porn, drugs, dick pics, casual violence and more, it\u2019s the ultimate in what could be termed teen angstertainment, making <em>Skins</em> look about as edgy as <em>Dawson\u2019s Creek</em>, and finishing what films such as Larry Clark\u2019s <em>Kids</em> and Catherine Hardwicke\u2019s <em>Thirteen</em> started.</p> <p>The characters include struggling drug addict Rue (Zendaya), <em>American Pyscho</em>-esque ultra-jock Nate (Jacob Elordi), mysterious newcomer Jules (Hunter Schafer), and many more who seem to rather too easily get away with cavorting about like a cross between Hunter S Thompson and Linda Lovelace in the supposedly \u201cnormal\u201d suburban US.</p> <p>At its hyperreal worst, <em>Euphoria</em> reeks of overindulgence, with extended blurred footage of zonked, grooving (intensely irritating) adolescents who, like all teens since time immemorial, just, hey, want to be different \u2013 like all their friends. However, if you stay with it (all episodes are available), there\u2019s a miracle \u2013 <em>Euphoria</em> calms its crap down. At which point it starts to truly encapsulate the chaos and anxiety of modern youth, where online fantasy crashes into real-life misery, causing the kind of inner bruising that only deep connections (in love and friendship) could ever hope to heal. As with genuine adolescence, if you can stick it out until the end, it gets kinda interesting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/11/joseph-gilgun-interview-brassic-this-is-england-preacher\">Joseph Gilgun: \u2018In a working-class community, often you're accepted for the oddball you've become'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/title/programme/e9e2a8a7-2d30-4f31-bcc2-c71010b6fee2/brassic\" title=\"\">Brassic</a></strong> is a new comedy from <em>Shameless</em> writer Danny Brocklehurst and actor Joe Gilgun (Woody in <em>This </em><em>Is England</em>).

      "bodyText": "Mindhunter (Netflix) Euphoria (Sky Atlantic) Brassic (Sky One) Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) | All 4 The Day Mountbatten Died (BBC Two) | iPlayer Don\u2019t judge me, but I wolfed down the entire second series of Mindhunter (in two sittings, mind \u2013 I\u2019m not an animal). It was bound to happen. I loved the first series (adapted by Joe Penhall from John E Douglas\u2019s 1995 book, with David Fincher as executive producer), which detailed the creation of the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit, where the gifted but stiff Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff), his gruff partner, Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), and icily astute Wendy Carr (Anna Torv) probed real-life serial killers such as the monstrous and monstrously articulate \u201cCo-ed Killer\u201d, Ed Kemper (Cameron Britton), in the hope of catching more. The new series opened with Ford (whose character is based on Douglas) recovering from a breakdown provoked by a close encounter with Kemper. The team, now housed in a larger, swankier basement (still a metaphor for the depths of the human psyche), have a supportive but sly, ladder-climbing new boss (Michael Cerveris), and the task of solving the Atlanta child murders (28 black people, mainly children, killed between 1979 and 1981) in a climate of heightened racial tension. Elsewhere, there are serial killer \u201cstar turns\u201d from the likes of \u201cSon of Sam\u201d David Berkowitz (Oliver Cooper) and Charles Manson (Damon Herriman, who also plays the venal, drivel-spouting hippy in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Mindhunter has always been as much about the troubled hunters as the hunted, and this second series features a disturbing backstory for Tench (his adopted son gets caught up in a child-murder), Carr embarking upon a doomed lesbian love affair and becoming sidelined in the workplace, and Ford\u2019s mental health continuing to fray like pulled threads on an expensive suit. Once again, the series boasts stellar performances, the Ford/Tench odd-couple dynamic grating and sparking at the centre, with stylish adventurous shooting from the moody grey-blue palette of the FBI offices, to the cheesy cop-show graphics heralding new locations. The \u201cBTK\u201d (\u201cbind, torture, kill\u201d)-strangler plot from the first series is still there, as a teasing background hum. Needless to say I\u2019ve already booked the sofa for the season three binge. While Mindhunter exploits society\u2019s obsession with scary monsters \u2013 that indefensible yet commonplace notion of serial killers as celebrities \u2013 it manages to remain rooted in history and research, and thus in exploration rather than celebration. It\u2019s easy to see how Sam Levinson\u2019s explicit teen drama Euphoria (originally an Israeli show) caused mass parental panic in the States. With its depictions of sex, porn, drugs, dick pics, casual violence and more, it\u2019s the ultimate in what could be termed teen angstertainment, making Skins look about as edgy as Dawson\u2019s Creek, and finishing what films such as Larry Clark\u2019s Kids and Catherine Hardwicke\u2019s Thirteen started. The characters include struggling drug addict Rue (Zendaya), American Pyscho-esque ultra-jock Nate (Jacob Elordi), mysterious newcomer Jules (Hunter Schafer), and many more who seem to rather too easily get away with cavorting about like a cross between Hunter S Thompson and Linda Lovelace in the supposedly \u201cnormal\u201d suburban US. At its hyperreal worst, Euphoria reeks of overindulgence, with extended blurred footage of zonked, grooving (intensely irritating) adolescents who, like all teens since time immemorial, just, hey, want to be different \u2013 like all their friends. However, if you stay with it (all episodes are available), there\u2019s a miracle \u2013 Euphoria calms its crap down. At which point it starts to truly encapsulate the chaos and anxiety of modern youth, where online fantasy crashes into real-life misery, causing the kind of inner bruising that only deep connections (in love and friendship) could ever hope to heal. As with genuine adolescence, if you can stick it out until the end, it gets kinda interesting. Brassic is a new comedy from Shameless writer Danny Brocklehurst and actor Joe Gilgun (Woody in This Is England). Vinnie (Gilgun), sharp, witty, bipolar, is first seen wanting to jump off a bridge in the fictional northern town of Hawley, then launching into a Trainspotting-esque spiel (\u201cFuck the middle class, fuck the Guardian\u201d, etc). Vinnie thinks that life is \u201cabout having your mates, having a laugh, just finding a way to survive\u201d. Duly, this week\u2019s opening two episodes involved him, his best mate, Dylan (Damien Molony), and their gang becoming embroiled in hectic, caper-strewn plots encompassing everything from the kidnapping of Shetland ponies via dealing with underground fatbergs to hostile crime bosses. Deeper themes lurk in Brassic, not least Vinnie\u2019s condition (Gilgun has bipolar disorder in real life), and Dylan\u2019s partner, young mum, Erin (Michelle Keegan), refusing to go along with the culture of extended adolescence, at one point acidly remarking to Vinnie that there appeared to be \u201cthree of them\u201d in her and Dylan\u2019s relationship. \u201cIf it is, I\u2019m the one getting the least sex\u201d, quipped Vinnie. On this showing, Brassic is funny, scratchy, surprising (Dominic West shows up as a useless, self-absorbed doctor), and promises to get darker. The Bafta-nominated letting agent comedy Stath Lets Flats returned, as unapologetically daft as ever. It\u2019s written by Jamie Demetriou, who stars with real-life sibling Natasha as idiotic Stath and his dopey sister Sophie (it took me a while to recognise Natasia as Nadja, the minxish vampire from What We Do in the Shadows). Stath Lets Flats sticks to a retro sitcom format, with plenty of gags and physical comedy from the desperate, delusional Stath. He yearns to impress his father (Christos Stergioglou) enough to take over the family business, but thus far has been foiled by the brash new manager (Dustin Demri-Burns), and Stath\u2019s bitchy, ambitious former fling Carole (Katy Wix). There\u2019s a side-plot involving a flirtation between Sophie and her bashful colleague, Al (Alastair Roberts), which could yet turn into the greatest filing cabinet-flanked romance since Tim and Dawn in The Office. For now, most of the comedy revolves around Stath\u2019s innate stupidity \u2013 on finding out that Carole was \u201cpreggo\u201d, he gasped: \u201cAre you the mother?\u201d Well, I laughed. Sam Collyns\u2019s The Day Mountbatten Died was a gruelling, affecting documentary marking the 40th anniversary of the day Louis Mountbatten, last viceroy of India and second cousin once removed to the Queen, was blown up on his holiday boat in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Ireland, dying alongside his daughter\u2019s mother-in-law, his young grandson and a local teenager, Paul Maxwell.

      "body": "<p>David Wallace-Wells is the deputy editor of <em>New York</em> magazine. In July 2017, he wrote a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans-annotated.html\" title=\"\">long-form essay</a> about the dire prospects for human civilisation caused by the climate crisis. It became the most read article in the history of the magazine and led to a book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/uninhabitable-earth-9780141988870.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Uninhabitable Earth: </em><em>A Story of the Future</em></a>, which is being published in paperback in September.</p> <p><strong>The first line of your book </strong><strong>state</strong><strong>s: \u201cIt is </strong><strong>worse, much worse, than you think.\u201d</strong><strong> If you were sitting down to write </strong><strong>the book again, would you </strong><strong>be inserting another \u201cmuch\u201d into that sentence? </strong><br>I still think the public aren\u2019t as concerned as they should be about some of the scary stuff that\u2019s possible this century. But I do think things have changed quite a bit. And I also think the politics have changed quite a lot. When I turned in the book in September, nobody had heard of Greta Thunberg. Nobody had heard of Extinction Rebellion. In the US, very few people had heard of <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/\" title=\"\">Sunrise</a>. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had not even been elected.</p> <p><strong>In the United States, you have a climate crisis denier </strong><strong>as president, yet areas of the </strong><strong>country are experiencing frequent flooding, more forest fires and rises in </strong><a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/new-jersey-heating-faster-most-us/\" title=\"\"><strong>average temperature of more than 2C</strong></a><strong>. </strong><strong>How</strong><strong> do you explain this? </strong><br>Actually, it\u2019s quite striking how many Americans do believe climate change is happening. [Democratic presidential nominee] <a href=\"https://www.jayinslee.com/\" title=\"\">Jay Inslee</a> says <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/tackling-climate-change-governor-jay-inslee-has-a-plan-for-that\" title=\"\">75% of voters want action, compared with 63% 12 months ago</a> \u2013 that is remarkable. There was a piece earlier this month in the <em>New York Times</em> about how for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/climate/climate-change-republicans.html\" title=\"\">many young Republicans, it is their top issue</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a pervasive techno-optimistic view that we can just invent something and it will solve the problem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>There seems to be a division </strong><strong>in the US Democratic nomination race </strong><strong>between candidates who advocate wholesale system change such as the </strong><a href=\"https://www.gp.org/green_new_deal\" title=\"\"><strong>Green New Deal</strong></a><strong> and others who favour a more incremental </strong><strong>progress because they claim that\u2019s the only way to get laws passed</strong><strong>. Which is the most effective approach? </strong><br>The science demands a quite systematic response; incremental policy simply isn\u2019t going to be adequate to avoid really terrible levels of warming. But ambitious legislation has to go through the Senate and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a scenario where a Democratic president takes office in 2021 with more than 60 Democratic votes [a three-fifths majority].</p> <p>On the other hand, the last few administrations have gotten quite creative in how to use what\u2019s called \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d, which you can use to pass stuff through the Senate with only 51 votes [a simple majority] by defining legislation as essentially budget-based. That\u2019s one reason why you see so many of the Democrats\u2019 plans are essentially investment programmes.</p> <p>Inslee has been more ambitious in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/opinion/jay-inslee-donald-trump-climate-democratic-primary.html\" title=\"\">putting forward details</a> about how he would regulate the fossil fuel business but some of the other campaigns have basically just put forward a sort of Green New Deal or green Marshall Plan \u2013 a massive spending programme directed at green energy projects.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re hopeful that technologies like geo</strong><strong>engineering and carbon capture will play a significant role in mitigating temperature rise. Some environmentalists and scientists argue that these unproven methods can\u2019t bail us out, and that they give licence to the fossil fuel industry to carry on polluting\u2026 </strong><br>I look at the science and say if we\u2019re defining a comfortable world [as] staying below two degrees of warming, I just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any way we can achieve that without a really quite dramatic amount of negative emissions.</p> <p>But I\u2019m also very mindful that there is a pervasive techno-optimistic view \u2013 especially among wealthy Americans \u2013 that we can just invent something and it will solve the problem.</p> <p>The UN says we need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">halve global emissions by 2030 to avoid catastrophic warming</a>. We\u2019re really deeply deluded about how quickly new technology can scale and can be deployed. We\u2019re far from having a 747 flying on a zero-carbon fuel.</p> <p><strong>We can agree to decarbonise \u2013 re</strong><strong>think our agriculture, aim for a meatless diet and so on \u2013 but we don\u2019t live in a global, centrali</strong><strong>sed command-and-control</strong><strong> </strong><strong>economy. Every country has </strong><strong>its own political interests. How do you make the world take collective action? </strong><br>That\u2019s harder than the technological problem. There are many cases of what I think of as climate hypocrisy, for example, Canada declaring a climate emergency and then the very next day <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/cognitive-dissonance-canada-declares-a-national-climate-emergency-and-approves-a-pipeline-119151\" title=\"\">approving a new oil pipeline</a>.</p> <p>Each individual nation could be quite aggressive in their decarbonisation and yet be living through the exact same climate that there would be if they took no action unless the rest of the world followed suit. No major industrial nation is on track to meet its commitments under Paris.</p> <p>My own hope is that I see almost half of our global emissions being produced by two countries \u2013 the US and China. Maybe it\u2019s naive, but I hope a cooperative pact can be reached between the two countries like the nuclear non-proliferation agreements that were made between the US and Russia in the cold war. The two nations remained rivals but were nevertheless jointly committed to protecting the planet from an existential threat.</p> <p>If the US and China really took aggressive leadership on this issue, the collective action problem would become less important \u2013 the world\u2019s most powerful countries have a way of bending the will of the less powerful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to fight\u00a0to make the world one we want to live in, rather than\u00a0giving up hope before the fight is\u00a0really over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Some environmentalists argue that we need to rethink economic growth \u2013 we need to reorient</strong><strong> our expectations of the conveniences and luxuries of modern life\u2026 </strong><br>I don\u2019t yet have a firm perspective on this. My intuition is that we don\u2019t need to abandon the prospect of economic growth to get a handle on climate change.</p> <p>I look at the case of the US and I see that if the average American had the carbon emissions of the average EU citizen, the country\u2019s emissions <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC\" title=\"\">would fall by 60%</a>. And I think most Americans would be happy with those lifestyles.</p> <p>The American electricity grid loses two-thirds of all energy produced as waste heat. We discard something like 50% or 60% of all of our food. So we could achieve some quite significant emissions gains.</p> <p><strong>Do you still think of yourself as a journalist or have you </strong><strong>morphed into an activist? </strong><br>I do still think of myself as a journalist. And I don\u2019t know how long that will last. I still feel like a chronicler of the story rather than a protagonist. I\u2019m really heartened and excited by all of the new activist energy that we\u2019ve seen over the last year.</p> <p><strong>Millennials are expressing doubts about having children because of the environmental crisis \u2013 they are concerned that their grandchildren and possibly their own children will be living in an inhospitable and volatile world. You have recently had a child\u2026 </strong><br>My intuition is that we need to fight to make the world the one we want to live in rather than giving up hope before the fight is really over. The world is going to get warmer. Almost inevitably, there will be a lot more pain and suffering in it than we have now. But how much is really up to us.</p> <p><strong>At what point should panic set in? It\u2019s plausible there\u2019ll be </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/climate-crisis-heat-is-on-global-heating-four-degrees-2100-change-way-we-live\" title=\"\"><strong>four degrees of warming by the end of the century,</strong></a><strong> which would mean mass migration from areas such as the Middle East and Asia to newly temperate areas such as Siberia </strong><strong>and Greenland. That\u2019s not a very smooth transition for human civilisation</strong><strong>. </strong><br>It seems hard to imagine. Yet we\u2019re already seeing some fair amount of panic. The significant amount of human migration we\u2019re seeing in the US coming from Central America, for example.</p> <p>I am personally horrified by the way our politics are beginning to adjust to them. We need to be much more open-hearted and attentive to the suffering of those around the world rather than closed off and hard-hearted, which is how almost all of the countries of the west have been over the last decade to refugees.</p> <p>We\u2019re also seeing panic in the protest movements, which are essentially declarations that existing power structures and priorities are simply not sufficient to address this crisis in the terms that it demands.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>David Wallace-Wells will be giving a </em><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/david-wallacewells-on-our-climate-emergency-68473061771\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Live talk about the climate emergency</em></a><em> at 7pm on Wednesday 11 September at Kings Place, north London.

      "bodyText": "David Wallace-Wells is the deputy editor of New York magazine. In July 2017, he wrote a long-form essay about the dire prospects for human civilisation caused by the climate crisis. It became the most read article in the history of the magazine and led to a book, The Uninhabitable Earth: A Story of the Future, which is being published in paperback in September. The first line of your book states: \u201cIt is worse, much worse, than you think.\u201d If you were sitting down to write the book again, would you be inserting another \u201cmuch\u201d into that sentence? I still think the public aren\u2019t as concerned as they should be about some of the scary stuff that\u2019s possible this century. But I do think things have changed quite a bit. And I also think the politics have changed quite a lot. When I turned in the book in September, nobody had heard of Greta Thunberg. Nobody had heard of Extinction Rebellion. In the US, very few people had heard of Sunrise. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had not even been elected. In the United States, you have a climate crisis denier as president, yet areas of the country are experiencing frequent flooding, more forest fires and rises in average temperature of more than 2C. How do you explain this? Actually, it\u2019s quite striking how many Americans do believe climate change is happening. [Democratic presidential nominee] Jay Inslee says 75% of voters want action, compared with 63% 12 months ago \u2013 that is remarkable. There was a piece earlier this month in the New York Times about how for many young Republicans, it is their top issue. There seems to be a division in the US Democratic nomination race between candidates who advocate wholesale system change such as the Green New Deal and others who favour a more incremental progress because they claim that\u2019s the only way to get laws passed. Which is the most effective approach? The science demands a quite systematic response; incremental policy simply isn\u2019t going to be adequate to avoid really terrible levels of warming. But ambitious legislation has to go through the Senate and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a scenario where a Democratic president takes office in 2021 with more than 60 Democratic votes [a three-fifths majority]. On the other hand, the last few administrations have gotten quite creative in how to use what\u2019s called \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d, which you can use to pass stuff through the Senate with only 51 votes [a simple majority] by defining legislation as essentially budget-based. That\u2019s one reason why you see so many of the Democrats\u2019 plans are essentially investment programmes. Inslee has been more ambitious in putting forward details about how he would regulate the fossil fuel business but some of the other campaigns have basically just put forward a sort of Green New Deal or green Marshall Plan \u2013 a massive spending programme directed at green energy projects. You\u2019re hopeful that technologies like geoengineering and carbon capture will play a significant role in mitigating temperature rise. Some environmentalists and scientists argue that these unproven methods can\u2019t bail us out, and that they give licence to the fossil fuel industry to carry on polluting\u2026 I look at the science and say if we\u2019re defining a comfortable world [as] staying below two degrees of warming, I just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any way we can achieve that without a really quite dramatic amount of negative emissions. But I\u2019m also very mindful that there is a pervasive techno-optimistic view \u2013 especially among wealthy Americans \u2013 that we can just invent something and it will solve the problem. The UN says we need to halve global emissions by 2030 to avoid catastrophic warming. We\u2019re really deeply deluded about how quickly new technology can scale and can be deployed. We\u2019re far from having a 747 flying on a zero-carbon fuel. We can agree to decarbonise \u2013 rethink our agriculture, aim for a meatless diet and so on \u2013 but we don\u2019t live in a global, centralised command-and-control economy. Every country has its own political interests. How do you make the world take collective action? That\u2019s harder than the technological problem. There are many cases of what I think of as climate hypocrisy, for example, Canada declaring a climate emergency and then the very next day approving a new oil pipeline. Each individual nation could be quite aggressive in their decarbonisation and yet be living through the exact same climate that there would be if they took no action unless the rest of the world followed suit. No major industrial nation is on track to meet its commitments under Paris. My own hope is that I see almost half of our global emissions being produced by two countries \u2013 the US and China. Maybe it\u2019s naive, but I hope a cooperative pact can be reached between the two countries like the nuclear non-proliferation agreements that were made between the US and Russia in the cold war. The two nations remained rivals but were nevertheless jointly committed to protecting the planet from an existential threat. If the US and China really took aggressive leadership on this issue, the collective action problem would become less important \u2013 the world\u2019s most powerful countries have a way of bending the will of the less powerful. Some environmentalists argue that we need to rethink economic growth \u2013 we need to reorient our expectations of the conveniences and luxuries of modern life\u2026 I don\u2019t yet have a firm perspective on this. My intuition is that we don\u2019t need to abandon the prospect of economic growth to get a handle on climate change. I look at the case of the US and I see that if the average American had the carbon emissions of the average EU citizen, the country\u2019s emissions would fall by 60%. And I think most Americans would be happy with those lifestyles. The American electricity grid loses two-thirds of all energy produced as waste heat. We discard something like 50% or 60% of all of our food. So we could achieve some quite significant emissions gains. Do you still think of yourself as a journalist or have you morphed into an activist? I do still think of myself as a journalist. And I don\u2019t know how long that will last. I still feel like a chronicler of the story rather than a protagonist. I\u2019m really heartened and excited by all of the new activist energy that we\u2019ve seen over the last year. Millennials are expressing doubts about having children because of the environmental crisis \u2013 they are concerned that their grandchildren and possibly their own children will be living in an inhospitable and volatile world. You have recently had a child\u2026 My intuition is that we need to fight to make the world the one we want to live in rather than giving up hope before the fight is really over. The world is going to get warmer. Almost inevitably, there will be a lot more pain and suffering in it than we have now. But how much is really up to us. At what point should panic set in? It\u2019s plausible there\u2019ll be four degrees of warming by the end of the century, which would mean mass migration from areas such as the Middle East and Asia to newly temperate areas such as Siberia and Greenland. That\u2019s not a very smooth transition for human civilisation. It seems hard to imagine. Yet we\u2019re already seeing some fair amount of panic. The significant amount of human migration we\u2019re seeing in the US coming from Central America, for example. I am personally horrified by the way our politics are beginning to adjust to them. We need to be much more open-hearted and attentive to the suffering of those around the world rather than closed off and hard-hearted, which is how almost all of the countries of the west have been over the last decade to refugees. We\u2019re also seeing panic in the protest movements, which are essentially declarations that existing power structures and priorities are simply not sufficient to address this crisis in the terms that it demands. \u2022 David Wallace-Wells will be giving a Guardian Live talk about the climate emergency at 7pm on Wednesday 11 September at Kings Place, north London. Tickets are \u00a320 each or \u00a327.50 with a copy of The Uninhabitable Earth (Penguin, \u00a39.99). A booking fee of \u00a31.26 applies",

Over two days, they will present evidence that capital punishment is so deeply flawed and riddled with racial animus that it makes a mockery of basic principles of fairness and equal justice.</p> <p>The court\u2019s seven judges will be asked to address a simple question. Will they allow men and women to be condemned to die despite powerful evidence that prosecutors deployed racially discriminatory tactics to put them on death row?</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking an unprecedented look at whether the courts will tolerate proven racial bias in the death penalty,\u201d said one of the case\u2019s leading lawyers, Cassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) capital punishment project. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about fundamental rights that go to the integrity of the courts and the entire criminal justice system.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of the case are four inmates facing execution: three African American men and a Native American woman. Over the past seven years Marcus Robinson, Quintel Augustine, Tilmon Golphin and Christina Walters have been on an extraordinary judicial roller coaster that has seen them taken off death row on grounds that their sentences were racially compromised, only to be slapped back on to it following a partisan backlash by the Republican-controlled state legislature.</p> <p>In all four cases, a review of their trials found racial bias had been an \u201coverwhelming\u201d feature of how death sentences were secured. In particular, the juries had been \u201cbleached\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A very stark and unmistakable picture of discrimination emerges</p> <footer> <cite>Cassandra Stubbs, ACLU</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Black potential jurors were systematically struck off \u2013 consciously and intentionally \u2013 at a rate far higher than their white equivalents.

That so many innocent people, most of them African American, had come close to being killed by the state alarmed local politicians to the extent that the then Democratic-controlled assembly decided to root out racial discrimination from the death penalty once and for all.</p> <p>In a historic break with the past, the RJA established that anyone who could prove race was a significant factor behind their death sentences would be deemed ineligible for capital punishment.</p> <p>That new protection unleashed one of the most thorough investigations into the practice of the death penalty in US history. What it uncovered shocked even lawyers working on RJA cases.</p> <h2>\u2018The more we looked, the more we found\u2019</h2> <p>First up was Cassandra Stubbs\u2019s client, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6316992-18-7-16-Robinson-NCSC-Brief.html\">Marcus Robinson</a>.

Yet Robinson was still condemned to death, becoming the youngest person at the time on the state\u2019s death row.</p> <p>When Stubbs began analyzing Robinson\u2019s trial she discovered that the jury had been grossly skewed along race lines. During jury selection, in which both defense and prosecution lawyers have the right to exclude potential jurors so long as they have legitimate reasons, the prosecutor John Dickson struck out five of 10 black people in the pool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d61910b201d8f76616e958260a6ad50decc7e05f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d61910b201d8f76616e958260a6ad50decc7e05f/0_0_3004_2119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Burns, center, mother of Marcus Robinson, listens in court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shirley Burns, center, mother of Marcus Robinson, listens in court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Rocco/Raleigh News &amp; Observer/MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That 50% dismissal rate was almost four times the rate at which eligible white jurors were rejected: just 14%.

That is, unless you have the family lineage that gives something extra to the bank you\u2019re working for.</p> <p>Another grim chapter in the hiring practices of the major banks was revealed when, last week, Deutsche Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/23/deutsche-bank-to-pay-16m-us-princelings-case\" title=\"\">was the latest to be fined over a so-called \u201cprincelings\u201d scandal</a>. According to allegations from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the unqualified offspring of powerful Chinese and Russian state figures had been offered jobs so that the bank could get a better foothold in future deals.</p> <p>While thousands of non-connected candidates fought through the rigorous hiring process, it appears that a select few got jobs with their only qualification being the position their fathers held in state-connected companies in Asia and Russia. One egregious example cited was the son of an executive at a Russian state-owned company who was transferredfrom Moscow to London but failed to turn up to work, cheated in an exam and was \u201ca liability to the reputation of the program, if not their firm\u201d \u2013 a quote unlikely to make their LinkedIn page.</p> <p>It is an example of a practice that has gone on for years, and across the industry \u2013 the investigation into Deutsche Bank was covered the period between 2006 and 2014. But before the German giant\u2019s settlement had come bigger figures \u2013 in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/business/dealbook/jpmorgan-chase-to-pay-264-million-to-settle-foreign-bribery-charges.html\" title=\"\">JPMorgan was penalised $264m</a>corr and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-settlements/credit-suisse-pays-77-million-to-settle-u-s-probes-into-china-hiring-idUSKBN1JV1XS\" title=\"\">Credit Suisse last year agreed to pay $77m</a>corr. One source in HR at the German bank said the Russian example was a classic case of what they had to handle every year.</p> <p>Deutsche did not admit or deny the findings under the settlement, but claims to have taken extensive measures to improve its practices. Whether that will be any comfort for those applying for jobs in Canary Wharf is open to question.</p> <h2>Regulators need to stay vigilant over PPI</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s lenders are eagerly awaiting the end of summer. As they return from their far-flung holidays, bankers will start processing the final batch of payment protection insurance (PPI) claims and start drawing a line under one of the largest mis-selling cases in UK banking history.</p> <p>It has already cost the largest high street lenders more than \u00a341bn to process claims and compensate customers. But some lenders have apparently been slow to learn their lesson. On Friday, it emerged that Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander had been flouting PPI rules set by the Competition and Markets Authority for nearly half a decade.</p> <p>It seemed simple enough: the regulator ordered banks to send customers an annual reminder, detailing three pieces of information: how much customers had paid for their PPI policies to date, what type of cover they had, and a reminder that they had a right to cancel the cover.</p> <p>But RBS failed to send reminders to nearly 11,000 customers over six years, meaning some consumers were paying for the insurance without being aware they still held policies. Santander, meanwhile, sent incorrect information to more than 3,400 of its mortgage PPI customers between 2012 and 2017.</p> <p>For anyone inclined to give the banks the benefit of the doubt, it\u2019s worth noting that RBS and Santander were both reminded to follow the CMA\u2019s orders as far back as 2016.</p> <p>Proving they cannot be trusted on PPI policies, both banks have since been forced to appoint independent reviewers to monitor their progress and make sure they don\u2019t break the rules for a third time.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t look good when banks are trying to wipe their hands clean and claim a fresh innocence a decade on from the financial crisis. And it only proves that City regulators will have to stay sharp if they hope to protect consumers from the next major scandal.</p>",

According to allegations from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the unqualified offspring of powerful Chinese and Russian state figures had been offered jobs so that the bank could get a better foothold in future deals. While thousands of non-connected candidates fought through the rigorous hiring process, it appears that a select few got jobs with their only qualification being the position their fathers held in state-connected companies in Asia and Russia. One egregious example cited was the son of an executive at a Russian state-owned company who was transferredfrom Moscow to London but failed to turn up to work, cheated in an exam and was \u201ca liability to the reputation of the program, if not their firm\u201d \u2013 a quote unlikely to make their LinkedIn page. It is an example of a practice that has gone on for years, and across the industry \u2013 the investigation into Deutsche Bank was covered the period between 2006 and 2014. But before the German giant\u2019s settlement had come bigger figures \u2013 in 2016, JPMorgan was penalised $264mcorr and Credit Suisse last year agreed to pay $77mcorr. One source in HR at the German bank said the Russian example was a classic case of what they had to handle every year. Deutsche did not admit or deny the findings under the settlement, but claims to have taken extensive measures to improve its practices. Whether that will be any comfort for those applying for jobs in Canary Wharf is open to question. Regulators need to stay vigilant over PPI Britain\u2019s lenders are eagerly awaiting the end of summer. As they return from their far-flung holidays, bankers will start processing the final batch of payment protection insurance (PPI) claims and start drawing a line under one of the largest mis-selling cases in UK banking history. It has already cost the largest high street lenders more than \u00a341bn to process claims and compensate customers. But some lenders have apparently been slow to learn their lesson. On Friday, it emerged that Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander had been flouting PPI rules set by the Competition and Markets Authority for nearly half a decade. It seemed simple enough: the regulator ordered banks to send customers an annual reminder, detailing three pieces of information: how much customers had paid for their PPI policies to date, what type of cover they had, and a reminder that they had a right to cancel the cover. But RBS failed to send reminders to nearly 11,000 customers over six years, meaning some consumers were paying for the insurance without being aware they still held policies. Santander, meanwhile, sent incorrect information to more than 3,400 of its mortgage PPI customers between 2012 and 2017. For anyone inclined to give the banks the benefit of the doubt, it\u2019s worth noting that RBS and Santander were both reminded to follow the CMA\u2019s orders as far back as 2016. Proving they cannot be trusted on PPI policies, both banks have since been forced to appoint independent reviewers to monitor their progress and make sure they don\u2019t break the rules for a third time. This doesn\u2019t look good when banks are trying to wipe their hands clean and claim a fresh innocence a decade on from the financial crisis. And it only proves that City regulators will have to stay sharp if they hope to protect consumers from the next major scandal.",

What we think of as constraints \u2013 the impositions of family, of friends, of social obligations \u2013 are often the buttresses of a rich emotional life. An isolated individual, free of all constraints, would hardly be happy. That\u2019s why we dread loneliness so much. Certainly, children cost in terms of time, money, sleep and anxiety. They stop you partying, affording a holiday, even reading a book. They also bring great pleasure and joy. There is nothing wrong with not having children, though that imposes its own burdens. There is, however, everything wrong with viewing children as mere constraints upon our lives. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

Payne was asked by the ABC on Sunday whether the question put by the 2GB host Ben Fordham to Gladys Berejiklian last week was an appropriate question to ask any woman, let alone a female premier. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it is appropriate to ask anyone male or female sensitive health questions like that, and it\u2019s not OK,\u201d Payne said. Asked whether she supported the intent of the bill in NSW to take abortion out of the Crimes Act, Payne said the issue was ultimately a matter for the state parliament, but she supported the change: \u201cI do think that it is important for it to be decriminalised, yes.\u201d Modelled on legislation passed in Queensland last year and co-sponsored by 15 MPs from across the political divide, the NSW reproductive healthcare Reform bill would remove abortion from the state\u2019s 119-year-old Crimes Act and creates a standalone healthcare act to regulate the procedure. While polling suggests the proposal has majority community support, the legislation has triggered a noisy backlash from both conservatives in politics, including, controversially, the former federal Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, and from conservative commentators in the media. Asked by Fordham last Friday whether she would have a termination, the premier said: \u201cI can\u2019t speak for what circumstances I\u2019d be faced with \u2026 but I\u2019m not someone who\u2019d be comfortable with going through that process. \u201cI\u2019m a very conservative person who would not feel comfortable with having that process. But that\u2019s just me. I can\u2019t speak for other women. It\u2019s not my place \u2026 I don\u2019t want anyone to feel guilty about decisions they\u2019ve made.\u201d With state politicians openly at odds, Joyce\u2019s campaigning has dragged the controversy into the federal scene. The NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro, gave Joyce a blast after he recorded a series of robocalls claiming the bill would \u201clegalise abortion for any reason right up until the day of birth\u201d and addressed an anti-abortion protest outside the state parliament. The bill has passed the lower house but debate in the upper house has been deferred.",

But take a look at this new ebike from <a href=\"https://fuell.us/\" title=\"\">Fuell</a> and you can immediately see something special is in the mix. It\u2019s not a bicycle that\u2019s has been powered up, it\u2019s a motorcycle that\u2019s been stripped down.</p> <p>For anyone familiar with outrageous two-wheel performance and design, Erik Buell is something of a legend. Now 69, he started out as a motorcycle racer before focusing on building his own machines, creating the game-changing Buell Motorcycle Company in Wisconsin. His designs were so outside-the-box that Harley-Davidson first invested in his company and then bought it outright. Buell worked for them for more than a decade, creating innovative and sometimes eccentric machines with quirky features, such as a vast frame that doubled as a fuel tank, or an exhaust system situated below the bike instead of down the side.</p> <p>Now Buell is back with a new venture \u2013 this time called Fuell. Two bikes are being offered: one is a neat and nimble city motorbike called Flow; the other is a chunky ebike named Fluid. It comes with a 250W crank-centred motor, or as a sportier \u201cS\u201d version with a more powerful 500W engine. What makes the Fluid exceptional is its range \u2013 up to 125 miles on a single charge. With an ebike you can never be stranded in the same way you can if you drain all the juice from an electric car, but range anxiety is still an issue for mile-hungry cyclists. The Fluid packs two integrated batteries into its large frame, giving a whopping total of more than 1kWh of power. Few people are going to set out to cover 125 miles on an ebike in a single trip, but whizzing around the city you\u2019d be amazed how many miles you eat up. The Fluid\u2019s extended range means you\u2019ll only need to worry about charging every week or two \u2013 it\u2019s about convenience as much as outright distance.</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect from Buell, the Fluid has sleek lines and numerous smart details to surprise and delight. It\u2019ll turn heads in the bike lanes of any city. To make it simple to use and easy to maintain, it has a Gates carbon belt drive and Shimano Alfine 8-speed geared hub. The batteries are quick to charge, reaching 80% in 2.5 hours and a full charge in 5 hours. The batteries are also removable and as battery technology evolves they can be upgraded. At the centre of the handlebars you\u2019ll find a 3in full-colour screen displaying speed, distance, battery level and five configurable motor-assist settings. It\u2019s quick away from the lights, super easy to ride and very comfortable, thanks partly to its unique adjustable suspension. The word cushty to comes to mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fed478d397b1b8e92b5880d2a1ee32b62a4560ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fed478d397b1b8e92b5880d2a1ee32b62a4560ef/15_13_1249_1965/636.jpg\" alt=\"One for the chaps: Stolen Goat shorts.\" width=\"636\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One for the chaps: Stolen Goat shorts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the Fuell Fluid, Eric Buell has insured that the old Harley-Davidson mantra \u201cLive to ride, ride to live\u201d has been brought bang up to date.</p> <h2>Cool kit</h2> <p><em>Super-stretchy and hardwearing, these gravel shorts add a layer of comfort to every bike ride. </em><strong>Stolen Goat shorts</strong> \u00a365, <a href=\"https://stolengoat.com/\">stolengoat.com</a></p> <p><em>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\" title=\"\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>",

What makes the Fluid exceptional is its range \u2013 up to 125 miles on a single charge. With an ebike you can never be stranded in the same way you can if you drain all the juice from an electric car, but range anxiety is still an issue for mile-hungry cyclists. The Fluid packs two integrated batteries into its large frame, giving a whopping total of more than 1kWh of power. Few people are going to set out to cover 125 miles on an ebike in a single trip, but whizzing around the city you\u2019d be amazed how many miles you eat up. The Fluid\u2019s extended range means you\u2019ll only need to worry about charging every week or two \u2013 it\u2019s about convenience as much as outright distance. As you\u2019d expect from Buell, the Fluid has sleek lines and numerous smart details to surprise and delight. It\u2019ll turn heads in the bike lanes of any city. To make it simple to use and easy to maintain, it has a Gates carbon belt drive and Shimano Alfine 8-speed geared hub. The batteries are quick to charge, reaching 80% in 2.5 hours and a full charge in 5 hours. The batteries are also removable and as battery technology evolves they can be upgraded. At the centre of the handlebars you\u2019ll find a 3in full-colour screen displaying speed, distance, battery level and five configurable motor-assist settings. It\u2019s quick away from the lights, super easy to ride and very comfortable, thanks partly to its unique adjustable suspension. The word cushty to comes to mind. With the Fuell Fluid, Eric Buell has insured that the old Harley-Davidson mantra \u201cLive to ride, ride to live\u201d has been brought bang up to date. Cool kit Super-stretchy and hardwearing, these gravel shorts add a layer of comfort to every bike ride.

The little car has now been adding a large helping of four-wheeled jollity to journeys and holidays for more than 60 years. Travel to any Italian city and you\u2019ll still see the bug-eyed cuties trundling down cobbled streets, looking like extras from a Fellini movie. The original roofed versions spawned dozens of quirky variations over the years, but one in particular became a bit of a touchstone: the 1962 \u2018Jolly\u2019 Spiaggina. It was a doorless beach buggy conversion with a fringed fabric roof that looked like it was made from an old deckchair. The word La Spiaggina is tricky to translate, but means something like \u2018beach-ette\u2019. Early models were relatively pricey and were bought by the rich and famous (Aristotle Onassis, Yul Brynner) as yacht tenders, golf carts and runabouts.</p> <p>Now you too can sample la dolce vita. Some of the dinky 500s have been fitted with an electric engine and can be hired from Hertz Italy as part of its Selezione Italia collection. The range comprises Italian car classics to suit every whim, from Alfa Romeos to Maseratis. One detail that will catch your eye is that the 500\u2019s auto shifter has just two settings: \u2018tortoise\u2019 and \u2018hare\u2019.</p> <p>It certainly beats hiring the usual VW Polo\u2026</p> <p><em>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\" title=\"\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>",

Travel to any Italian city and you\u2019ll still see the bug-eyed cuties trundling down cobbled streets, looking like extras from a Fellini movie. The original roofed versions spawned dozens of quirky variations over the years, but one in particular became a bit of a touchstone: the 1962 \u2018Jolly\u2019 Spiaggina. It was a doorless beach buggy conversion with a fringed fabric roof that looked like it was made from an old deckchair. The word La Spiaggina is tricky to translate, but means something like \u2018beach-ette\u2019. Early models were relatively pricey and were bought by the rich and famous (Aristotle Onassis, Yul Brynner) as yacht tenders, golf carts and runabouts. Now you too can sample la dolce vita. Some of the dinky 500s have been fitted with an electric engine and can be hired from Hertz Italy as part of its Selezione Italia collection. The range comprises Italian car classics to suit every whim, from Alfa Romeos to Maseratis. One detail that will catch your eye is that the 500\u2019s auto shifter has just two settings: \u2018tortoise\u2019 and \u2018hare\u2019. It certainly beats hiring the usual VW Polo\u2026 Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166",

After going online to purchase his book on humanity\u2019s future, I noticed that in the UK it was sold as Our Final Century and in the US it\u2019s marketed as Our Final Hour. Apparently, our perception of the passage of time is dependent on our culture. Sean McGibbon Kilkenny, Ireland If there\u2019s a vacancy for a world leader, can I suggest Martin Rees? A ray of evidence-based, compassionate common sense in the fog of narcissistic self-interest. Mick Nagle Richmond, London If your face fits\u2026 David Olusoga\u2019s article on the inequalities of university entrance procedures reminded me of my much simpler application to Edinburgh University in 1963 (\u201cPredicted grades are a lottery and work against the poorest students. Let\u2019s get rid of them\u201d, Comment). There was a one-page questionnaire to fill in \u2013 educational achievements etc \u2013 followed by a space to glue in a passport photo. \u201cThis will be used for identification, not selection purposes\u201d was the reassuring final sentence.

In the new era of the learning machine, anything that is routine \u2013 from a production line to the legal processes surrounding buying and selling a house \u2013 will be performed by a robot. What will drive economic activity instead are myriad face-to-face interactions, from education to medicine, which can\u2019t be done by machines but can be done by people living in vast, highly-connected urban areas that foster such interactivity.</p> <p>This trend is already clear \u2013 think Tokyo and Tokyo Bay, San Francisco Bay, the M25 area in London, the Beijing orbital rings. In an age of capitalism with robots, the advantage of such areas is going to become even more marked. Essentially, the more an economy can agglomerate, the more it will take off, especially if it is supported by fit-for-purpose public interventions and investment.</p> <p>Crucially, success will depend on people being able to move quickly, cheaply and in great numbers, one of the reasons for the great worldwide boom in rail transport and high-speed rail in particular. For one of the iron rules of human behaviour is that we will invest only so much time in travelling and commuting: more than an hour and the willingness to travel falls away.</p> <p>In this worldwide race to capture the benefits of agglomeration, Britain has one extraordinary and potentially transformatory possibility, as important in the fourth industrial revolution as the possession of water and coal was in the first. If we can bring London, Birmingham, Manchester and other great cities together in an interlinked urban network with travel times of about an hour or less between them \u2013 the aim of HS2 \u2013 we will possess a world-beating agglomeration.

      "bodyText": "The foundations of the dynamic economies of the 21st century will be massive agglomerations of people. In the new era of the learning machine, anything that is routine \u2013 from a production line to the legal processes surrounding buying and selling a house \u2013 will be performed by a robot. What will drive economic activity instead are myriad face-to-face interactions, from education to medicine, which can\u2019t be done by machines but can be done by people living in vast, highly-connected urban areas that foster such interactivity. This trend is already clear \u2013 think Tokyo and Tokyo Bay, San Francisco Bay, the M25 area in London, the Beijing orbital rings. In an age of capitalism with robots, the advantage of such areas is going to become even more marked. Essentially, the more an economy can agglomerate, the more it will take off, especially if it is supported by fit-for-purpose public interventions and investment. Crucially, success will depend on people being able to move quickly, cheaply and in great numbers, one of the reasons for the great worldwide boom in rail transport and high-speed rail in particular. For one of the iron rules of human behaviour is that we will invest only so much time in travelling and commuting: more than an hour and the willingness to travel falls away. In this worldwide race to capture the benefits of agglomeration, Britain has one extraordinary and potentially transformatory possibility, as important in the fourth industrial revolution as the possession of water and coal was in the first. If we can bring London, Birmingham, Manchester and other great cities together in an interlinked urban network with travel times of about an hour or less between them \u2013 the aim of HS2 \u2013 we will possess a world-beating agglomeration. If on top we have access to the world\u2019s biggest market \u2013 the EU and its network of trade relationships \u2013 alongside a smart industrial strategy, Britain could be Europe\u2019s number one economy in the century ahead.

Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to launch a third inquiry into the costs and benefits of HS2 can only be understood in terms of his need to neutralise the Brexit party in the election obviously planned for the autumn, as well as assuaging his own Brexit right and activists. The future of HS2, he can say, is under review and his commitment to Brexit cannot be doubted. If he can do this \u2013 and not give Labour the time to replace Corbyn, who he needs to remain leader \u2013 he has a chance of converting his opinion poll lead into a parliamentary majority.

Offal, or the \u201cfifth quarter\u201d, is represented by ox tongue with salsa verde, or a salad of tripe. There are bruschetta and pasta dishes. There are salamis and cheeses from nearby. A plate of Calabrian salted anchovies arrives and, with it, warm toast with curls of unsalted butter on ice. It is one of the few occasions when unsalted butter makes sense. Spread the chilled butter thickly and add the meaty anchovies. It\u2019s bliss on toast. We also have crudit\u00e9s, ribbons of fennel, celery and carrot cut just so, to be dipped into balsamic vinegar and peppery olive oil.</p> <p>We have ordered lightly. We intend to do justice to the main event. There are three breeds of beef here, from Scottish Black Angus at \u20ac4.90 per 100g to the local Chianina at \u20ac8.20. We are directed to the one in between, the equally local Marchigiana at \u20ac6.80. The restaurant manager, Marco, spent years in London, latterly at Jamie Oliver\u2019s Fifteen, and returned only a few months ago. He knows how to chat up a Londoner. He tells us the Marchigiana is fattier than the more expensive cut and therefore less tough. To prove it, he brings the 1kg steaks tableside, so we can coo over the marbling like proper beef pervs.</p> <p>Let me address those who are repulsed: some of us eat meat. That\u2019s something you will have to cope with. But if you\u2019re going to eat beef, it should be rarely and the very best you can afford, from well-cared-for animals. Those who want to lecture me are welcome to do so. Carry on. I will then sit in the corner and think very seriously about my life choices, perhaps for much of next week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7409f546bb929f6d7db2569605c8624ebad6aa6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7409f546bb929f6d7db2569605c8624ebad6aa6a/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Ribbons of fennel, celery and carrot cut just so\u2019: crudit\u00e9s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ribbons of fennel, celery and carrot cut just so\u2019: crudit\u00e9s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sofie Delauw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Florentines generally ask for their steaks cooked to a rareness from which it might be possible to detect a pulse.

      "bodyText": "The blame game is upon us. Since it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson could be so naive as to think that the European Union will reopen the withdrawal agreement or ditch the Irish backstop, it seems likely that he is actively pursuing a no-deal Brexit. But it is obviously in the prime minister\u2019s interest to be seen as the innocent party, especially in the context of a general election that now seems highly likely. And so, in his recent letter to Donald Tusk, Johnson wrote: \u201cThis government will not put in place infrastructure, checks or controls at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u201d Few outside the UK take such a claim seriously. If the UK were to follow such a course of action, it would be in breach not only of its World Trade Organization obligation to treat all its trade partners equally but of sundry other international obligations and agreements. The British government\u2019s own Yellowhammer report, which was leaked last week, concluded that attempts to avoid a hard border in Ireland would be \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Johnson\u2019s claim may be legally dubious but his political intention is clear: if a hard border reappears in Ireland this will be the fault of an unreasonable EU. This is an oft-repeated refrain among Brexiters and Ireland\u2019s tiny band of Eurosceptics, anxious to find a reason to dislike the EU in a country where the organisation is overwhelmingly popular. The argument gets more traction than it deserves because of a confusion about borders. In particular, there seems to be a common assumption that the absence of checks on goods crossing frontiers is the default state of the world and that the existence of border controls is a weird aberration. The assumption is false. As even a cursory glance at border arrangements across the globe reveals, border controls are entirely normal: it is their absence that is the aberration.

Its purpose was to demonstrate what a non-gender-blind approach to economics might look like and to encourage women to take a bigger part in the economic debate. It\u2019s our future too.</p> <p>What do gender-blind policies mean in practical terms? One example: transport. The cumulative cuts in fuel duty will cost the exchequer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-pledges-to-freeze-fuel-duty-for-ninth-consecutive-year\" title=\"\">\u00a39bn a year </a>by 2020. The Treasury says this is gender neutral: both men and women drive. But men are more likely to own cars, drive cars with higher fuel consumption and go longer distances. At the same time, public transport, on which women rely more than men, has received so little investment that the sight of a bus in rural areas is a rare event.</p> <p>Another example: unequal pay means that no single woman on median earnings can afford to buy or rent an averagely priced house in any region in England. <a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/analysis/reports/a-home-of-her-own-housing-and-women/\" title=\"\">Average rent takes 43% of a woman\u2019s median earnings, 28% of men\u2019s</a>. </p> <p>And a third: we have a growing crisis in care because this precious commodity is valued so poorly. Between 2005 and 2014, the number of hours of unpaid care rose by 25% <a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/analysis/2018-wbg-briefing-social-care/\" title=\"\">from 6.5bn to 8.1bn hours a year</a> \u2013 that\u2019s mainly women\u2019s work \u2013 at the same time as debt and low wages mean women have to hold on to employment, however insecure.</p> <p>\u201cWomen are disproportionately affected \u2026 as a result of structural inequalities which mean they earn less and have more responsibility for unpaid care and domestic work,\u201d says <a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/commission/commissioners/dianeelson/\" title=\"\">Prof Diane Elson</a>, chair of WBG\u2019s commission on a gender-equal economy that reports next year. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this. Our positive vision for an alternative economy puts care and wellbeing of people and planet front and centre.\u201d</p> <p>Under New Labour, urged on by feminist ministers, WBG had a major influence on, for instance, working tax credit and the need to consider the gender impact on policies (a statutory duty easily ignored). Since then, the road has become rockier domestically. The European Union, however, has passed several beneficial laws for women\u2019s employment. </p> <p>So what next? WBG argues not for \u201ca budget for women\u201d but for \u201can economy for human beings\u201d that works more effectively and fairly. One day, let\u2019s hope \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d are extinct, replaced by an understanding that pro-equality policies work more effectively both for women and men, for social cohesion and for the environment.</p> <p>\u201cClassical economics is based on the independent man who works full time and is in control,\u201d says Mary-Ann Stephenson, WBG\u2019s director. \u201cBut life isn\u2019t like that. We are all interdependent. It\u2019s part of what it means to be human. We will all give or receive care at some time in our lives. So we need a system in which care is a fundamental part of the economy and the unpaid economy is fully recognised as having value.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4cf6bb7095cde2e00a32f7b2b4c71b581370e11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4cf6bb7095cde2e00a32f7b2b4c71b581370e11/0_344_5154_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman carrying water on her head, Nigeria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Why, Marilyn Waring asked, does water going through a pipe have a market value but not water carried on a woman\u2019s head?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Porter/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1988, <a href=\"http://www.marilynwaring.com\" title=\"\">Marilyn Waring</a>, a former New Zealand MP, wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Women_Counted\" title=\"\"><em>If Women Counted</em></a>, criticising the use of gross domestic product as a system that \u201ccounts oil spills and wars as a contributor to economic growth, while child rearing and housekeeping are deemed valueless\u201d.

Why, Waring asked, does water going through a pipe have a market value but not water carried on a woman\u2019s head?</p> <p>In the same vein, the WBG argues that attention should be paid to what it calls social infrastructure \u2013 for instance, investment in social care \u2013 in addition to investment in roads and rail.

In the same vein, the WBG argues that attention should be paid to what it calls social infrastructure \u2013 for instance, investment in social care \u2013 in addition to investment in roads and rail. This isn\u2019t a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d \u2013 it makes economic sense. If the UK invested 2% of GDP in the care sector, it would create 1.5m jobs; the same investment creates 750,00 jobs in construction. \u201cCan you imagine the nation\u2019s annual budget becoming a realistic description of wellbeing of the community and its environment, a reflection of real wealth and different values?\u201d Waring wrote in 1988. The members of WBG not only imagine just such a society, they pursue it with the kind of academic rigour and economic expertise that reveals the real price we all pay for continued injustice and inequality \u2013 and how there is a better alternative. May WBG have the best of birthdays. \u2022 Yvonne Roberts is a freelance journalist, writer and broadcaster",
