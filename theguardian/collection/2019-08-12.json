      "bodyText": "William Barr, the attorney general, has criticised \u201cserious irregularities\u201d at the Metropolitan correctional center (MCC) in New York where the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in an apparent suicide on Saturday. Barr also vowed to pursue the federal sex-trafficking case against Epstein and said: \u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy.\u201d Barr, who was speaking to the National Fraternal Order of Police in New Orleans, has come under increasing pressure to explain seeming lapses in jail protocol around Epstein\u2019s death. Epstein was reportedly not on suicide watch and was alone in his cell. A protocol to check on him every half an hour reportedly was reportedly not followed. And a person familiar with operations at the federal jail told the Associated Press that one of the two people guarding Epstein the night he died was not a correctional officer. The person was not authorized to disclose information about the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. The person said Epstein hanged himself days after being taken off suicide watch. The case was important, Barr said on Monday, to the FBI, the Department of Justice, prosecutors at the southern district of New York and victims of Epstein \u201cwho had the courage to come forward and deserve the opportunity to confront the accused in the courtroom\u201d. Barr added that the federal case against Epstein was \u201cvery important to the Department of Justice and to me personally\u201d. He said: \u201cI was appalled, and indeed the whole department was frankly angry, to learn of the MCC\u2019s failure to adequately secure this prisoner.\u201d He added that the DoJ was \u201cnow learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation\u201d. Barr went on: \u201cWe will get to the bottom of what happened and there will be accountability. The victims deserve justice and they will get it.\u201d Later in the day, the US House judiciary committee announced a bipartisan investigation into the circumstances of Epstein\u2019s death and the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 policies regarding inmates who are considered at risk of suicide. Federal investigators on Monday swarmed Epstein\u2019s private island in the Caribbean. Two senior law enforcement officials told NBC News that the FBI had launched a search of Epstein\u2019s home off the coast of St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. In 2008, Epstein received a widely criticised plea deal in Florida and served a year in prison on strikingly lenient terms. He was arrested again in July on US federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges relating to the alleged abuse of hundreds of young girls. He pleaded not guilty and was denied bail. Alex Acosta, Trump\u2019s labor secretary, resigned over the matter, having been the US attorney in Miami when the controversial plea deal was brokered a decade ago. Speculation now centres on the whereabouts of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and heiress who is accused of helping groom and procure young girls for Epstein to abuse. She has repeatedly denied such accusations. News that Epstein had been found dead in his prison cell broke early on Saturday morning, the day after unsealed court documents in a settled civil case involving Maxwell detailed his connections with a web of powerful men including Prince Andrew, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. All have denied any wrongdoing. Barr\u2019s reference to \u201cserious irregularities\u201d followed a statement he released on Saturday, in which he said \u201cserious questions\u201d had been raised by Epstein\u2019s death. Barr said on Saturday: \u201cI was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr Epstein\u2019s death raises serious questions that must be answered.\u201d The federal prisons bureau announced that the FBI would investigate as it was revealed that Epstein was reportedly not on suicide watch despite an apparent suicide attempt three weeks earlier, when he was found unconscious on the floor of his cell. It has widely been reported that the Manhattan jail in which Epstein was held has been operating without sufficient staffing. Two guards at the special housing unit where Epstein was placed were on overtime, ABC News reported, saying one officer was working a mandatory overtime shift and the other was on his fifth overtime shift of the week. Epstein reportedly did not have a cellmate, which would be another serious breach of protocol in a high-security jail. The jail does have a video surveillance system, but federal standards do not allow the use of cameras to monitor areas where prisoners are likely to be undressed unless those cameras are monitored only by staff members of the same gender as the inmates. As a practical matter, that means most federal jails nationwide focus cameras on common areas, rather than cell bunks. An autopsy has been carried out but the results were not immediately made public. The situation was further complicated on Saturday by an outpouring of conspiracy theories on social media. To huge controversy, Donald Trump re-tweeted a claim that Bill and Hillary Clinton had somehow played a role in Epstein\u2019s death. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The transport select committee said using any type of mobile phone while driving had potentially catastrophic consequences. The MPs called for more severe penalties \u201ccommensurate with the risks\u201d, as road deaths linked to phone use have risen steadily over the past decade. In 2017, there were 773 casualties on Britain\u2019s roads, including 43 deaths and 135 serious injuries, in crashes in which the driver was using a mobile phone. But rates of enforcement had dropped by more than two-thirds since 2011, the committee said, as it called on the government to work with police to make better use of technology and deter offenders. Although penalties for using a handheld mobile phone while driving were doubled in 2017 \u2013 to six points on a licence and a \u00a3200 fine \u2013 the committee said they should be reviewed and potentially increased.

      "bodyText": "More than 50 major UK retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, Harrods and Iceland, have demanded tax cuts from the government to safeguard the future of the high street amid intense pressure from online rivals. In a letter to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, the bosses of some of the nation\u2019s biggest retail chains called for an urgent reform of the business rates system, which taxes companies based on the buildings they occupy. Coming as the British economy stands on the brink of recession with the growing likelihood of no-deal Brexit, the retailers warned the strain was increasing on the sector and that greater government support was required. In this context, the chief executives writing the letter said that Boris Johnson should place reforms to protect the high street at the heart of an economic package to boost business investment in Britain as the country leaves the EU. Signed by the heads of Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons, as well as Boots, Greggs and John Lewis, the retailers said the system of business rates was outdated and harmed investment, to the detriment of jobs and communities. Retail is the largest private sector employer in the UK, employing approximately 3 million people. The industry accounts for around 5% of the British economy but pays about 10% of all business taxes and about 25% of business rates. Bricks-and-mortar retailers have faced intense competition from online rivals over recent years, with the proportion of goods bought online rising to about a fifth of all sales. Digital retailers tend to face lower taxes as they occupy less physical space. Amazon pays \u00a363.4m in business rates, almost \u00a340m less than Next, despite clocking up more than double the sales in the UK of the clothing retailer. According to the British Retail Consortium, which compiled the signatures on the letter, vacancy rates on the high street have risen to 10.3%, the highest since January 2015, in a sign of the gradual decline of town centres across the country. Average sales figures over the past 12 months have also dropped to the lowest on record. Clive Lewis, the chairman of the fashion chain River Island, said: \u201cThe burden that rates places on all high street businesses not only stifles growth but is a major contributor to the closure of stores and the resulting decline in towns across the country.\u201d The retailers called for a freeze in the business rates multiplier, which is used by the government to raise the tax each year to reflect general inflation. They also called on Javid to alter a system of business rates relief, which allows firms time to adapt to an increase, to save companies \u00a3295m next year. Several major retailers have called for changes in the past in the face of rising online competition. Tesco has called for a 2% online sales tax that would help fund a cut in business rates for shops, while Mike Ashley has argued that retailers with more than 20% of their sales online should pay a 20% tax on digital sales. Last year the former chancellor Philip Hammond announced the launch of a digital services tax from April 2020 that would hit online technology giants such as Amazon and Google. A Treasury spokesperson said it would use its \u00a33.6bn towns fund to support high streets, allowing them to attract greater footfall, jobs and investment, adding: \u201cThe chancellor will announce further details of the government\u2019s policy programme in the coming weeks and months.\u201d",

Raul Flores, 83, and Maria Flores, 77, had been married for 60 years and had moved back from California to El Paso to retire. \u201cThey were the most loving, humble and giving people you could ever meet,\u201d said Raul Flores Jr, one of the couple\u2019s three children. \u201cThey had so much love in them and for each other that God probably decided to take them together.\u201d Flores said his entire family felt and appreciated the support shown by the community. \u201cIt is amazing how much love and support El Paso has to offer,\u201d he said. The city continues to mourn the lives lost in what community leaders described as a senseless tragedy, and the funeral for the Floreses is only the latest for the many victims, who ranged in age from 15 to 90 and who included eight Mexican nationals and a German national. The suspect in the shooting turned himself in to police shortly after the attack with an AK-47-style rifle, which also injured 25 people. Family members and friends of the Floreses said the couple had met across the border in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. \u201cRaul was a tailor at a local shop where he first laid eyes on Maria. He would make sure he was outside sweeping when Maria would walk down the sidewalk,\u201d according to the family\u2019s written tribute. \u201cHe tried getting her attention by asking her: \u2018Te cepillo el pelo? [Shall I brush your hair?]\u2019 as he motioned with the broom.\u201d Eventually he \u201cswept her off her feet\u201d, the family said. The Rev Fabian Marquez, who officiated the funeral mass for the Floreses at St Stephen Catholic church, met the family at an improvised reunification center set up the day of the attack for relatives and others who sought to know the fate of the shooting victims. \u201cTelling them that their parents died was the most difficult thing I ever had to do as a priest in my 15 years,\u201d Marquez said. \u201cThe attack by a stranger who came to the city and took out the lives of loving people affected not only this family, but the entire city.\u201d Sandra McNeil and Irene Valenzuela, friends of the Floreses, said the couple was devoted to their children, grandchildren and extended family members. They were often organizing or involved in birthday parties or other celebrations. \u201cThey were the sweetest, nicest, loving and welcoming people you could ever know,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cTheir ear-to-ear smiles were genuine. They were the kind of people who would hug you when they greeted you.\u201d Incense wafted throughout the church as Marquez and family members walked around the two coffins gently swinging an incense-filled censer and praying. During the service, Marquez said he and Flores family members had gone to the improvised memorial behind Walmart, where thousands of residents still stop to leave flowers, pictures, encouraging words, prayers, plush toys and other items. To show El Paso\u2019s binational culture, one visitor planted US and Mexican flags sewn together. After the service, mariachis played traditional Mexican songs like Amor Eterno (Eternal Love) as relatives led the twin caskets on rollers to a pair of hearses for cremation. According to a police arrest affidavit, the killer told police he was the shooter and that his targets \u201cwere Mexicans\u201d. About 20 minutes before his shooting spree, the killer posted a screed on the anonymous messaging board 8Chan filled with anti-immigrant rhetoric and claimed that he wanted to stop the country\u2019s \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d. Police said the killer apparently drove 650 miles from Allen, Texas, to carry out the attack. The former US congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and current congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee attended the funeral. O\u2019Rourke, who is from El Paso, is seeking the Democratic party\u2019s nomination for the 2020 presidential race. Raul and Maria Flores are survived by their three children, Raul Flores Jr, Leticia Saldana, and Adriana Flores, 11 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren.

      "bodyText": "Australia is gearing up for a fight with the European Union over the naming of hundreds of products including feta, gruyere and scotch beef as negotiations continue over an \u201cambitious\u201d free trade agreement. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has released a list of names the EU wants protected as part of the new trade deal \u2013 known as \u201cgeographical indications\u201d or GIs \u2013 which are aimed at protecting European products. The issue is of major concern to Australian cheesemakers who face the prospect of not being able to use terms such as feta, gruyere and gorgonzola to name their products. Birmingham said he was prepared to drive a \u201chard bargain\u201d as Australia inched closer to a deal with the EU, but said if it was successful producers would gain access to a lucrative market of 500 million consumers. \u201cAustralia doesn\u2019t like the idea of geographical indications but this is a not-negotiable element from the European Union,\u201d Birmingham told the ABC on Tuesday morning. \u201cWe will put up a strong fight in terms of areas of Australian interests and ultimately what we\u2019re trying to do is get the best possible deal that ensures Australian businesses and farmers can get better access to a market engaging 500 million potential consumers.\u201d He said the FTA deal would only be inked if \u201coverall\u201d it was in Australia\u2019s interests to do so. The EU\u2019s list of proposed names includes many obscure beers, spirits, cheeses and meats, with most of the names linked to their geographic area of provenance. While the terms brie and camembert are not included, specific names such as Brie de Meaux and Camembert de Normandie are. There had been some concern among producers that prosciutto might also be listed, but the EU has suggested only that Prosciutto di Parma, Prosciutto di San Daniele and Prosciutto Toscano be specifically protected. Geographic indicators for the wine industry have already been negotiated, meaning a push from Italy and the EU for the use of the name prosecco to be restricted in the same way as champagne will not form part of the FTA negotiation. Birmingham said Europe had already allowed Australia to use the term prosecco under a previous agreement, and the industry had consequently made investment and marketing decisions. \u201cOur view is that we negotiated over those wine terms all those years ago and there\u2019s no need to reopen them,\u201d Birmingham said. The EU is already Australia\u2019s second-largest trading partner and third-largest export destination, with two-way goods and services trade last year valued at $109bn. Consultation is now under way on the GI list. Birmingham said feedback from the Australian public would help the government make its case in the trade negotiations.",

      "bodyText": "A vaccine to protect against chlamydia has moved closer to becoming reality after a pioneering clinical trial found the treatment to be safe. The vaccine successfully provoked an immune response, boosting levels of antibodies against the chlamydia bacterium in the blood and vaginal fluids. About 131m cases of the sexually transmitted infection are diagnosed worldwide every year, and there were almost 220,000 new cases in England last year. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, but infection often has no symptoms and many people are unaware they have it. Without treatment, it can lead to a range of complications for men and women, including fertility issues and an increased risk of HIV. Dr Frank Follmann, the head of chlamydia vaccine research at Statens Serum Institut in Denmark and a co-author of the study, said: \u201cChlamydia is a hidden epidemic. It is very well adapted to infecting both men and women and in most cases it does it without any symptoms.\u201d There have been recent drives to improve testing through screening programmes, particularly among young people, but the study\u2019s authors say such measures have failed to tackle the problem and suggest a vaccine would be beneficial. Writing in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, the researchers describe how they tested two formulations of a vaccine, with each type given to 15 women aged between 19 and 45 who did not have chlamydia. Another five chlamydia-free women were given a placebo. All received three injections into their arm muscle over four months, followed by two doses administered through a nasal spray in the weeks after. Neither the women nor those monitoring the impact of the vaccine were aware of who was in which group. The results showed no serious adverse reactions to the vaccines. The vaccinations, but not the placebo, produced an immune response. Follmann said the presence of antibodies in vaginal fluid was important. \u201cWe see the antibodies as a first line of defence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be able to target the bacteria once it enters the genital tract.\u201d He said the study suggested the injection could provide sufficient protection against chlamydia, without the need for the nasal spray. The findings raise hopes that the vaccine could eventually be given at the same time as the HPV vaccine, which protects against certain cancers including that of the cervix. The treatment is still at an early stage of development, but the team said the trial results were promising and that testing should proceed to the next stage with a larger number of participants. \u201cThe next step is to test whether or not it could in fact protect [against chlamydia infection] in humans,\u201d Follmann said.",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Joshua is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with staging his heavyweight title rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia, despite growing criticism from human rights organisations, and does not believe it will damage his reputation, his manager Eddie Hearn has said. Amnesty International is among those to have warned that the Saudi authorities are attempting to \u201csportswash\u201d their abysmal human rights record by bringing the fight, billed as the \u201cClash of the Dunes\u201d, to Diriyah on 7 December, and have urged Joshua to change his mind. However, Hearn said that he and Joshua had understood that holding the rematch for the WBA, IBF and WBO belts in Saudi Arabia would have its \u201cpluses and minuses\u201d \u2013 but had been persuaded by the \u201cvision\u201d the country had to promote boxing. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that money had nothing to do with it but it was more about the infrastructure and the fact they have done it before,\u201d said Hearn. \u201cWe had to be very comfortable because we knew there would be criticism.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has pledged to spend a further \u00a3100m on improving prison security in a move quickly dismissed as bravado. The money will go toward airport-style technology, including X-ray scanners and metal detectors, to prevent drugs, weapons and mobile phones getting into jails, and strengthening the Counter Corruption Unit. The spending is in addition to \u00a370m announced last year for the same purpose. Johnson has made a wave of a justice-focused announcements this week, including new prison places, a review of sentencing,and increased use of controversial stop and search. The pace of announcements and the populist nature of the policies have fuelled speculation that the prime minister is planning an imminent general election. Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson, said: \u201cThis is yet another hollow move by Boris Johnson to seem tough on crime, but yet again fails to tackle the causes of crime. The further funding announced is still not being used to rehabilitate people to stop them committing crimes in the first place. \u201cBoris Johnson can lock people up for longer or search people on their way in and out of prison, but none of this bravado will actually make our streets safer. Instead of just talking tough, it\u2019s time Boris Johnson looked at the evidence in front of him.\u201d The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon said: \u201cThese measures fall woefully short of what is needed to make our prisons safe. Faced with a prisons emergency caused by austerity, Boris Johnson is timidly tinkering at the edges. \u201cReckless Tory cuts to staffing and budgets unleashed unprecedented levels of violence in our prisons. The Tories have slashed the prisons budget by hundreds of millions of pounds and there are still thousands fewer prison officers than when they came to power. Our prisons have too few staff to safely manage the existing prison population, never mind any planned expansion. \u201cBoris Johnson should set out a detailed plan and provide proper funding to ensure that our prisons have the staffing and resources needed to focus on rehabilitation and reducing reoffending.\u201d Johnson pledged \u00a32.5bn to create an extra 10,000 prison places over the weekend and \u00a385m for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on Monday. In recent weeks, the government has also announced a \u00a31.8bn cash injection for the NHS and a \u00a32.1bn boost to no-deal Brexit preparations. Johnson said: \u201cWe cannot allow our prisons to become factories for making bad people worse. We will stop the drugs, weapons and the mobile phones coming in, so we can safeguard victims, protect staff, cut violence and make our prisons properly equipped to reform and rehabilitate.\u201d The Ministry of Justice said the funding was newly released from the Treasury and would be immediately available. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said: \u201cThere is a direct link between crime on the wings and crime on our streets. It can no longer be assumed that prison walls are enough to stop organised criminals from continuing their operations. \u201cThis funding will have a transformative effect on prisons and give our hard-working officers the advantage as they tackle this scourge head on. By disrupting those who continue to offend behind bars, we can keep our staff and other prisoners safe, and make sure that prisons truly fulfil their purpose of protecting the public.\u201d The previous justice secretary, David Gauke, oversaw a shift in tone in the government\u2019s approach to prisons, focusing more on rehabilitation and reducing reoffending. An education and employment strategy was published during his tenure, which focused on the benefits of work and training in reducing reoffending, and Gauke advocated for a move away from short-term prison sentences of six months or less. Johnson\u2019s new tough-on-crime drive threatens to undo some of this work, and reports suggest the prime minister will not scrap short sentences.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 13 August.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Hong Kong protesters have shut down one of the world\u2019s busiest airports</strong> in a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/hong-kong-airport-authority-cancels-flights-over-protests\">escalation of the mass demonstrations</a> that have plunged the city into its worst political crisis in decades. The unprecedented cancellation of all flights followed the fourth consecutive day of protests at the airport amid increasingly threatening statements from Beijing. A Chinese official said \u201cterrorism\u201d was emerging in the city, while in Hong Kong authorities demonstrated water cannons for use in crowd control. The protests are in their 10th week, with confrontations between protesters and police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/12/hong-kong-police-britain-arms-protests-boris-johnson\">growing more violent</a>. At least 40 people were treated in hospital after clashes on Sunday, including a woman who was hit, reportedly with a beanbag round, and could potentially lose an eye. </p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s cities are straining under the weight of the country\u2019s rapid population growth,</strong> with a major audit finding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/13/600bn-of-spending-needed-over-next-15-years-infrastructure-australia-says\">$600bn in new spending</a> is needed to keep pace with demand over the next 15 years. The audit by Infrastructure Australia found that infrastructure is being particularly stretched on the urban fringes of Australia\u2019s four largest cities \u2013 Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 where the majority of the country\u2019s population boom is occurring. The problem is being compounded by ageing assets, rising road congestion, public transport crowding and growing demands on so-called \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d, such as schools, hospitals and parks, as more people move into cities. The IA report warns that in order for Australia to cope with forecast population growth, spending on infrastructure will need to remain at about $40bn a year.</p> <p><strong>An Australian coalmine has nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years without penalty,</strong> under a Coalition climate policy that promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/13/coal-mine-increases-greenhouse-gas-emissions-without-penalty-foi-reveals\">to put a limit on industrial pollution</a>. Anglo American has been given the green light to increase emissions at its Moranbah North mine twice since 2016, according to documents released under freedom of information laws. The pollution increase was approved under a scheme known as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, which promised to ensure cuts paid for by taxpayers through the government\u2019s \u201cdirect action\u201d emissions reduction fund were not just wiped out by rises elsewhere. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the failure to impose a hard pollution cap on big companies was the main reason national emissions were rising each year at odds with the government\u2019s pledge at the Paris climate summit.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52587bb1895a647b7e92d833be9d2d2e8c0cceaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52587bb1895a647b7e92d833be9d2d2e8c0cceaa/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of a forest fire in Boguchar District\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of a forest fire in Boguchar District.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 13 August. Top stories Hong Kong protesters have shut down one of the world\u2019s busiest airports in a dramatic escalation of the mass demonstrations that have plunged the city into its worst political crisis in decades. The unprecedented cancellation of all flights followed the fourth consecutive day of protests at the airport amid increasingly threatening statements from Beijing. A Chinese official said \u201cterrorism\u201d was emerging in the city, while in Hong Kong authorities demonstrated water cannons for use in crowd control. The protests are in their 10th week, with confrontations between protesters and police growing more violent. At least 40 people were treated in hospital after clashes on Sunday, including a woman who was hit, reportedly with a beanbag round, and could potentially lose an eye. Australia\u2019s cities are straining under the weight of the country\u2019s rapid population growth, with a major audit finding that $600bn in new spending is needed to keep pace with demand over the next 15 years. The audit by Infrastructure Australia found that infrastructure is being particularly stretched on the urban fringes of Australia\u2019s four largest cities \u2013 Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 where the majority of the country\u2019s population boom is occurring. The problem is being compounded by ageing assets, rising road congestion, public transport crowding and growing demands on so-called \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d, such as schools, hospitals and parks, as more people move into cities. The IA report warns that in order for Australia to cope with forecast population growth, spending on infrastructure will need to remain at about $40bn a year. An Australian coalmine has nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years without penalty, under a Coalition climate policy that promised to put a limit on industrial pollution. Anglo American has been given the green light to increase emissions at its Moranbah North mine twice since 2016, according to documents released under freedom of information laws. The pollution increase was approved under a scheme known as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, which promised to ensure cuts paid for by taxpayers through the government\u2019s \u201cdirect action\u201d emissions reduction fund were not just wiped out by rises elsewhere. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the failure to impose a hard pollution cap on big companies was the main reason national emissions were rising each year at odds with the government\u2019s pledge at the Paris climate summit. World A cloud of smoke and soot bigger than the European Union is billowing across Siberia as wildfires in the Arctic Circle rage into an unprecedented third month. The normally frozen region, which is a crucial part of the planet\u2019s cooling system, is spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and worsening the manmade climate disruption that created the tinderbox conditions. US attorney general William Barr has criticised \u201cserious irregularities\u201d at the jail where the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in an apparent suicide on Saturday. Muslims in Indian-administered Kashmir spent the religious holiday of Eid al-Adha in a security lockdown, unable to call their friends and relatives as an unprecedented communications block remained in place for an eighth day. The Trump administration is moving forward with one of its most aggressive steps yet to restrict legal immigration, denying green cards to many migrants who use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance, officials announced Monday. Ebola can no longer be called an incurable disease, scientists have said, after two of four drugs being trialled in the major outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were found to have significantly reduced the death rate. Opinion and analysis Is the \u201crevolt\u201d against Gladys Berejiklian over the abortion bill real? asks Anne Davies. As a bill to decriminalise abortion makes its way through the New South Wales parliament, some sections of the News Corp media have painted the split among Liberals during the conscience vote as a fundamental fissure that Berejiklian (who voted for reform) would deeply regret. \u201cThis is not a revolt,\u201d writes Davies. \u201cThis is posturing by the right, looking for a new war to prosecute now they have lost the battle over same-sex marriage and are gradually losing the war over climate change in the face of overwhelming evidence.\u201d On Friday the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, appeared before the House economics committee.

That optimism helps improve projection for tax revenue, but the Reserve Bank is not so concerned about pumping up the budget surplus numbers through inflated wage growth estimates.\u201d Sport Norway\u2019s Suzann Pettersen has been handed a Solheim Cup wildcard, despite having played just two events since November 2017. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho might sniff from his studio but football\u2019s philosophers are here to stay, writes Jacob Steinberg. Animal rights campaigners say they will sue a sporting champion for animal cruelty after he was filmed biting the head off a live cockerel during a dinner with friends. The Brigitte Bardot foundation said the actions of the Basque pelota player Bixente Larralde were \u201cshocking and sickening\u201d.

With question marks over Jack Nowell\u2019s ankle injury \u2013 the Exeter winger is hoping to be fit for England\u2019s final warm-up match against Italy on 6 September \u2013 Jones has included six back-three players, meaning he has gambled with only two tightheads in Kyle Sinckler and Dan Cole and two scrum-halves \u2013 Ben Youngs and Willi Heinz. Brad Shields, who is currently nursing a foot injury, and Harry Williams are among those to miss out. \u201cIt\u2019s our best 31,\u201d insisted Jones. \u201cI\u2019m convinced it\u2019s our best 31. I could have picked more experienced players but I just don\u2019t feel they\u2019ll give us what the younger guys will give us.\u201d</p> \n<p>McConnochie is the first uncapped member of an England World Cup squad since 2011, when Joe Simpson was included by Martin Johnson. He was due to make his debut against Wales last Sunday but was ruled out with a hip injury, prompting the 27-year-old to fear the worst. \u201cIt was a dark 24 hours with the injury,\u201d said the Olympic sevens silver medallist. \u201cThen come this morning I was quite at peace, if it didn\u2019t happen I\u2019d have no regrets over the process. Eddie has been great all the way through. He said something really good to me at the start which was you are in because you\u2019re great at what you do.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has admitted he is powerless to stop England\u2019s problem with off-field indiscipline after omitting Ben Te\u2019o from his World Cup squad following his altercation with Mike Brown at a recent training camp in Treviso. Te\u2019o was the high-profile omission from England\u2019s 31-man squad for Japan after a second breach of discipline in recent months, having been forced to apologise to his teammates along with Billy Vunipola following a late-night drinking session at the end of the Six Nations, while Brown was also omitted by Jones. England\u2019s last overseas World Cup eight years ago was blighted by off-field problems including the infamous dwarf-throwing incident in Queenstown and Manu Tuilagi\u2019s ferry jump in Auckland. More recently Tuilagi was sent home in disgrace from an England training camp along with Denny Solomona for a late-night drinking session two years ago. Jones refused to confirm that the omissions of Te\u2019o and Brown were a result of their altercation but he predicted further issues arising between now and the end of England\u2019s World Cup campaign. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have our problems and we\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe\u2019re like any family \u2013 everyone sits around the dining table, everyone enjoys good conversation but you know there are problems and we\u2019re exactly the same. We\u2019ve got 31 sitting around the table, we can have nice conversations [but] you know potentially there\u2019s a problem. The players \u2013 they are adults, they\u2019re responsible, they want to play for England and we could have some problems. If we do, we\u2019ll deal with them. \u201cEvery team has problems\u201a\u201d don\u2019t believe the Legacy book [about the All Blacks culture], which everyone seems to base their opinion on teams on. No team\u2019s like that \u2013 every team has its problems.\u201d Owen Farrell, confirmed as Jones\u2019s World Cup captain, added: \u201cWe want to police ourselves as much as we can. The thing of being part of that is making sure that we\u2019re being good lads and I think we have a good group.\u201d Jones did not rule out the possibility of calling on Te\u2019o in the event of injuries elsewhere, but refused to reveal the names of the players put on standby. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into reasons why he\u2019s not been selected. We\u2019ve had that conversation with Ben. He understands it. Whether he agrees with it is another matter. He\u2019s not in our top 31 players at the moment.\u201d In place of Te\u2019o, Jones has selected Piers Francis among his centres and called on the rookie flanker Lewis Ludlam, who made an impressive debut against Wales, as well as Ruaridh McConnochie, the uncapped Bath winger, who caps a remarkable rise, having only made the transition from sevens to XVs last summer. With question marks over Jack Nowell\u2019s ankle injury \u2013 the Exeter winger is hoping to be fit for England\u2019s final warm-up match against Italy on 6 September \u2013 Jones has included six back-three players, meaning he has gambled with only two tightheads in Kyle Sinckler and Dan Cole and two scrum-halves \u2013 Ben Youngs and Willi Heinz. Brad Shields, who is currently nursing a foot injury, and Harry Williams are among those to miss out. \u201cIt\u2019s our best 31,\u201d insisted Jones. \u201cI\u2019m convinced it\u2019s our best 31. I could have picked more experienced players but I just don\u2019t feel they\u2019ll give us what the younger guys will give us.\u201d McConnochie is the first uncapped member of an England World Cup squad since 2011, when Joe Simpson was included by Martin Johnson. He was due to make his debut against Wales last Sunday but was ruled out with a hip injury, prompting the 27-year-old to fear the worst. \u201cIt was a dark 24 hours with the injury,\u201d said the Olympic sevens silver medallist. \u201cThen come this morning I was quite at peace, if it didn\u2019t happen I\u2019d have no regrets over the process. Eddie has been great all the way through. He said something really good to me at the start which was you are in because you\u2019re great at what you do. That gives an uncapped player like me massive confidence.\u201d",

After she went public with her claims, at least five other women said they had been targeted by the man, who is involved with a regional Conservative policy forum. The allegations kicked off a furore on Twitter, with the female activists asking for the organiser not to be named, but calling on party headquarters to act against him. Around 185 activists have now signed a letter criticising the \u201cabhorrent way\u201d the party\u2019s code of conduct is structured, saying it is not possible for people to be held to account for sexual harassment as things stand.

Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When was it released?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it so popular with kids?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there violence? And is it addictive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements \u2013 nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers \u2013 into one package that is free to download.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Police in Upper Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/27374218/fortnite-champ-bugha-swatted-streaming\">told ESPN</a> they had received a call from someone pretending to be Giersdorf.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is preparing for a parliamentary battle against MPs trying to block a no-deal Brexit in the second week of September, as his cross-party opponents continue to be divided about the best way to stop the UK crashing out on 31 October. A senior government source said Downing Street believed the first legislative showdown over no deal would be on 9 September, when parliament is due to debate a progress report on power-sharing in Northern Ireland. The expectation is that a cross-party group of MPs will try to use this to carve out time to legislate against a no-deal Brexit by requesting an extension to article 50. The prime minister could face a confidence motion brought by Jeremy Corbyn aimed at collapsing his government as early as 3 September, when MPs return from their summer break. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said on Monday that an early confidence motion in the prime minister \u201chas to be an option\u201d. However, senior Labour and rebel Conservative sources are sceptical about whether they have the numbers to defeat Johnson at this stage, as many Tory MPs still believe there are legislative routes to prevent a no-deal Brexit that have to be exhausted first. One source close to a former cabinet minister, who is coordinating efforts to stop no-deal, said they believe at least five or six Conservative MPs would be needed to vote against Johnson\u2019s government, but \u201cthe numbers aren\u2019t there yet\u201d. This is because several independent MPs and possibly some Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum could abstain or vote with the government. One independent MP said speculation about a no-confidence vote immediately after recess was \u201cjumping ahead of events\u201d. \u201cYou need Tory rebels to win, and they have to have a reason to support it,\u201d the MP said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be tokenistic, and it can\u2019t just be because Boris isn\u2019t the leader you wanted. There has to be a coherent reason and a coherent subsequent plan to stop no deal.\u201d As uncertainty clouds the confidence vote, there are several different cross-party groups trying to devise legislative ways to stop a no-deal Brexit involving senior Tory MPs such as Dominic Grieve and Philip Hammond. However, they have not yet agreed on a single strategy, and the Institute for Government warned on Sunday that MPs opposed to no-deal may \u201cfind few opportunities to make their move \u2013 and time is running out\u201d. A senior government source said Downing Street expects the first showdown to happen on 9 September because the government is bound by law to provide a report on Northern Ireland on 4 September and to then debate it in parliament within five days. Boris Johnson may meet key EU leaders, such as Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, but not Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, before the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, at the end of August. The EU is adamant that the backstop is not up for renegotiation, but the senior government source said there was still hope in Downing Street that a deal might be possible if it became clear that parliament could not prevent no deal on 31 October. The government source said No 10 was not expecting any breakthrough with the EU until Brussels had seen what happens in the first weeks of September, as the parliamentary battle plays out. One Tory MP fighting against no deal said this was part of No 10\u2019s effort to unfairly blame their side for frustrating a deal with Brussels, and Downing Street had been quite successful in \u201cpicking off\u201d colleagues who were worried about being held responsible. However, the MP said a vote of no confidence in Johnson\u2019s government would have more chance of success later in October, as the reality of no-deal drew nearer and its consequences became more apparent. They said this was a \u201cvery nuclear option\u201d that would only be tried as a last resort, given the risk that this approach could backfire and lead to an election after a no-deal Brexit. If a no-confidence vote was passed, MPs would first have 14 days to form an alternative government, but if this was unsuccessful an election would be triggered. In this event, Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, has threatened to press ahead with Brexit on 31 October with or without a deal and schedule the election for the days after that date, while parliament is shut down. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson remained \u201cvery clear in his determination to get a deal\u201d. He said: \u201cHe believes a deal is in the UK\u2019s and the EU\u2019s best interests and he has said he will be energetic in pursuit of a deal. We very much want a deal, but we\u2019re also clear about what needs to be achieved in order to secure that.\u201d The spokesman added: \u201cHe has held a number of conversations with EU leaders, so has the prime minister\u2019s sherpa, David Frost. We are also making very detailed preparations at home to ensure the UK is ready to leave the EU in all circumstances on 31 October.\u201d Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said he had stressed the government\u2019s message that the UK is leaving on October 31 with or without a deal in a conversation with EU commissioner Phil Hogan, saying that \u201cwhile we\u2019re ready to energetically enter into new negotiations in a spirit of friendship, the backstop must go\u201d. Earlier, Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, acknowledged that he had previously argued that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be chaos. \u201c[The prime minister] wants to achieve a deal, but if we cannot achieve a deal, then it needs to be as orderly a Brexit as possible. That is why the work of government at the moment is focused hugely on that effort.\u201d Buckland added that \u201cthere is a difference between crashing out and not achieving a deal\u201d, and said ongoing work would \u201cavoid the chaos of a crash-out\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "National Grid had experienced three blackout \u201cnear-misses\u201d in as many months before Friday\u2019s major outage left almost a million homes in the dark and forced trains to a standstill around the UK. The system operator, already under investigation by the energy watchdog, faces criticism from within the industry that it has not done enough to guard against the risk of blackouts. National Grid blamed the \u201cincredibly rare\u201d nationwide power cut on a severe slump in the grid\u2019s frequency \u2013 a measure of energy intensity \u2013 following the unexpected shutdown of two power generators. It will face an investigation into its handling of the energy system after the first blackout in more than a decade following the shutdown of a gas-fired power plant in Bedfordshire and the Hornsea windfarm in the North Sea at about 5pm of Friday. It said it would work with the regulator and energy companies to \u201cunderstand the lessons learned\u201d after two power plants shut down unexpectedly within minutes of each other, causing severe rush hour travel disruption across the country. But industry sources claim National Grid has been aware of the growing potential for a wide-scale blackout \u201cfor years\u201d, and has suffered a spate of near-misses in recent weeks. The Guardian understands that in every month since May there has been a severe dip in the grid\u2019s frequency from its normal range around 50Hz. Industry sources have confirmed that the grid\u2019s frequency has fallen below 49.6Hz on three different occasions in recent months, the deepest falls seen on the UK grid since 2015. On Friday the blackout was triggered when the frequency slumped to 48.88Hz.

The unexpected outage triggered an emergency call for backup electricity supplies which stabilised the energy grid\u2019s frequency before a blackout was triggered. In addition, the grid\u2019s frequency fell to 49.55Hz on 9 May, and 49.58Hz of 11 July. A spokesman for National Grid said these events were \u201cindependent\u201d.

Steve Shine, chairman of Anesco, a battery company, said: \u201cIt would be easy for National Grid to write this incident off as a fluke event, but they have actually been aware of this potential issue for many years.\u201d The growing concern over National Grid\u2019s grip on the energy system has emerged as the energy regulator, Ofgem, issued an ultimatum to the system operator calling for an interim report on the blackouts by the end of the week ahead of a full technical report by early September. National Grid has managed to avoid wide scale blackouts by triggering last-minute contracts to help it stabilise the grid and avoid breaching the crucial 49.5Hz limit set by the regulator. It contracts energy suppliers to ramp up their output from generators and batteries to make up for an outage, and offers contracts to companies such as factories and supermarkets, which can temporarily cut their energy demand to help stabilise the frequency of the grid. But many of the companies tasked with supplying the \u201csafety net services\u201d \u2013 such as batteries and diesel farms, which are banks of small-scale generators \u2013 have warned that National Grid is not doing enough to safeguard the system against blackouts. The UK\u2019s booming renewable energy output can make it more difficult for National Grid to balance the frequency of the grid, which was originally built to accommodate fossil fuel power plants, which generate more intensive energy. National Grid said it had embraced the UK\u2019s renewable industry by developing \u201cfrequency response\u201d tools \u2013 such as quick-fire back-up supplies of extra electricity \u2013 which should make it technically possible to run the energy system without any fossil fuels by 2025.

Steven Meerman, the founder of battery firm Zenobe, called on National Grid to \u201cupdate its old rules of thumb\u201d to determine how many reserve services it kept on standby in the future. \u201cIt may be the energy system is changing faster than expected,\u201d he said. John Pettigrew, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, defended the grid\u2019s response in a post on social media site LinkedIn entitled \u201cthere is never a good time for a power cut\u201d. He said: \u201cContrary to some erroneous media reports, I am not on holiday \u2013 indeed, I\u2019ve been at my desk all weekend. \u201cAs CEO of National Grid plc ultimately the buck stops with me.\u201d",

About 450 overseas pests that damage or feed on trees have been introduced to US forests due to the growth in international trade and travel.

Some diseases, such as one that has infected trees across Hawaii, are little understood by scientists. Together, these maladies pose a growing threat to US forests that are coming under increasing strain from rising temperatures and altered rainfall and wildfire patterns, particularly in the west of the country, due to global heating. There are an estimated 6bn dead trees standing in the US west, with more trees now dying due to disease, insects and wildfire than are being felled for wood products. The impact of pests is visible in urban settings, too. Ash trees in Chicago have been devastated by the emerald ash borer, with city authorities last year turning some of the dying trees into public artworks. Trees are considered an invaluable resource in slowing global heating, due to their ability to soak up and store planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions.

Or so goes the story that has become the core of Narendra Modi\u2019s extraordinary appeal.</p>\n    <p>Modi was born in 1958 to a poor family in western India\u2019s Gujarat state, where he developed a strong dislike for the ruling Congress party as a result of hanging around a political office near his father\u2019s tea stall.</p>\n    <p>While still a child, he started attending daily meetings of the <a href=\"http://rss.org/\">Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</a>, said to be the world\u2019s largest volunteer organisation, whose Hindu nationalist ideology envisions the country\u2019s diverse Hindu population as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be given primacy in India.</p>\n    <p>Hindu nationalists were sidelined by India\u2019s founding prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/may/01/greatspeeches\">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, whose vision of India was of a secular nation at ease with its bewildering plurality. Their parties, including Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), struggled to win more than 10% of the national vote for decades until the 1990s, when they started to expand on the back of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\">national campaign to demolish a 16th-century Mughal mosque</a> and replace it with a Hindu temple.</p>\n    <p>BJP\u2019s support was limited to wealthier Hindus in the country\u2019s north and west, with resistance to the party from poor, marginalised Hindus, Muslims and south Indians thought to be permanent hurdles to Hindu nationalist domination.</p>\n    <p>Modi\u2019s magnetism, especially his personal branding as a tea boy who climbed to the country\u2019s highest ranks, has changed those calculations, drawing vast support from the country\u2019s emerging middle and lower-middle classes. Young Indians had grown up being told their country was on the cusp of becoming a superpower. In Modi they had a leader who spoke as if it already was.</p>\n    <p>Alongside aspiration, the BJP promotes a vision of Hindu cultural supremacy that sidelines the country\u2019s 300m minority population. As chief minister of Gujarat state, Modi was a firebrand Hindutva campaigner. In 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\">anti-Muslim riots in his state killed at least 1,000 people</a>, resulting in the future prime minister becoming an international pariah who was banned from entering the US.</p>\n    <p>In response, Modi presented himself as an outsider being attacked by elites: a refrain that would become a central part of his political messaging, that he was constantly being targeted by the English-speaking media out of Delhi.</p>\n    <p>When popular disgust at corruption scandals plaguing the previous Congress government boiled over into street protests in 2011, it provided the rightwing populist leader a national springboard. His mastery of political theatre, and finger on the pulse of Indians, has now secured him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/india-election-results-narendra-modi-bjp-victory\">the strongest mandate of any leader in decades</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\">Michael Safi</a></b>&nbsp;<i>in Delhi</i><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Grylls\u2019s remark that the river was full of crocodiles prompted Modi, wearing a cap and mackintosh, to tell him how as a poor boy in Gujarat, with no bathroom at home, he used to bathe in a pond every day.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s privacy regulator said it is studying the use of controversial facial recognition technology by property companies amid concerns that its use in CCTV systems at the King\u2019s Cross development in central London may not be legal. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office warned businesses using the surveillance technology that they needed to demonstrate its use was \u201cstrictly necessary and proportionate\u201d and had a clear basis in law. The data protection regulator added it was \u201ccurrently looking at the use of facial recognition technology\u201d by the private sector and warned it would \u201cconsider taking action where we find non-compliance with the law\u201d. On Monday, the owners of the King\u2019s Cross site confirmed that facial recognition software was used around the 67-acre, 50-building site \u201cin the interest of public safety and to ensure that everyone who visits has the best possible experience\u201d. It is one of the first landowners or property companies in Britain to acknowledge deploying the software, described by a human rights pressure group as \u201cauthoritarian\u201d, partly because it captures images of people without their consent. Canary Wharf is also interested in deploying the technology. Hannah Couchman, a policy and campaigns officer from Liberty, said it amounted to \u201ca disturbing expansion of mass surveillance that threatens our privacy and freedom of expression as we go about our everyday lives\u201d. She added: \u201cThere has been no transparency about how this tool is being deployed and who it is targeting.\u201d Concerns were also voiced by the regulator responsible for overseeing the use of CCTV. Tony Porter called on ministers to introduce \u201crobust and transparent legislation\u201d in order \u201cto protect the rights and privacy of people going about their business\u201d. The King\u2019s Cross site, mostly to the north of the mainline terminus, includes the headquarters of Google and the Central Saint Martins art school. The Guardian is also sited on the fringe of the development. Cameras using the software are used by police forces to scan faces in large crowds in public places such as streets, shopping centres, football stadiums and music events such as the Notting Hill carnival. Images harvested can then be compared to a database of suspects and other persons of interest. The use of facial recognition software by South Wales police is being challenged in the courts by an office worker in Cardiff, in a test case backed by Liberty whose result is keenly anticipated by regulators and across the industry. Despite that, the Welsh force unveiled plans to give officers facial recognition apps on their phones so officers can identify suspects in the street without having to take them back to a police station, technology whose deployment was recently backed by Sajid Javid when he was home secretary. But there are also doubts about the accuracy of the technology. Researchers at the University of Essex were invited by the Met police to study the force\u2019s trials of its facial recognition software and concluded that only in 19% of the 42 cases studied could they be sure the force had identified the right person. Experts have also raised concerns that facial recognition technology has a racial bias, that it is less effective in accurately distinguishing black people \u2013 although few studies have been conducted by the authorities in the UK. Last year a researcher at MIT\u2019s Media Lab in the US concluded that software supplied by three companies made mistakes in 21% to 35% of cases for darker-skinned women. By contrast, the error rate for light-skinned men was less than 1%. King\u2019s Cross would not provide any detail about the software used by its surveillance cameras, beyond saying in a statement that they used a \u201cnumber of detection and tracking methods, including facial recognition\u201d across the development. There were also \u201csophisticated systems in place to protect the privacy of the general public\u201d, a spokesperson for King\u2019s Cross added in a statement, although again these were not spelled out. Daragh Murray, a senior lecturer in human rights law at the University of Essex, said it was difficult to debate the ethics or legality of what King\u2019s Cross was doing because \u201cit is very difficult to adjudicate in the abstract. They\u2019ve given us very little information as to what they doing.\u201d Last year a trial of facial recognition software at the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester was halted by regulators, because every visitor was being checked against a set of 30 suspects and missing persons provided by the police. Regulators were concerned the trial monitored too many ordinary people. The King\u2019s Cross development is owned by a consortium of Argent, a property developer, Hermes Investment Management, on behalf of BT Pensioners, and the Australian pension scheme AustralianSuper.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s most severe blackout in more than a decade caused rush hour travel disruption across the UK\u2019s biggest train stations, railways, roads and airports last Friday evening, and left almost a million homes across the country in the dark. The energy watchdog has asked National Grid, the energy system operator, to give an initial report into what went wrong by the end of this week, while the government has announced a separate inquiry. The network company could even face a fine. Here are some key questions relating to Friday\u2019s incident: What caused the blackout? National Grid blamed the \u201crare and unusual event\u201d on a severe drop in the grid\u2019s frequency \u2013 a measure of energy intensity flowing around the network \u2013 following a pair of major generator outages. A key part of the operator\u2019s job is to keep the frequency of the grid steady at around 50Hz; a deviation of more than 1% in either direction is enough to cause parts of the energy system to automatically shutdown as a safety precaution. The blackout took place after two near-simultaneous power plant outages \u2013 at the Little Barford gas-fired power plant and the Hornsea offshore wind farm \u2013 caused the frequency to drop below the grid\u2019s safety limits. Little Barford, which is owned by German power group RWE, tripped shortly before 5pm on Friday evening. The outage was followed minutes later by the unexpected shutdown of the Hornsea offshore windfarm, which is owned by Danish wind power company Orsted. RWE said its power plant shut down automatically due to a technical issue which is \u201cnot uncommon\u201d at power plants. Orsted declined to comment on why its giant windfarm went offline while it investigates the issue alongside the energy regulator. How was the problem fixed? National Grid called on backup electricity providers to ramp up their output within seconds of the unplanned outages. Some of these backup suppliers include small-scale power plant owners, battery operators and even supermarket fridges. Usually these backup contracts can stabilise the frequency of the electricity grid before the frequency drops too far, but on Friday the safety net was not enough to stop parts of the grid from automatically shutting down. National Grid gave the all-clear for these networks to begin restarting their system 15 minutes after the outages. It said that by 5.40pm all the regional electricity networks had managed to restart their systems and restore power to their customers. Could it happen again? National Grid is working with the regulator, the generators and other stakeholders to \u201cunderstand the lessons learned\u201d from Friday\u2019s blackout. However, industry sources have warned that \u201cnear-misses\u201d are on the rise and the system operator has been aware of the growing potential for a wide-scale blackout for years. In the last 12 weeks the grid\u2019s frequency has fallen dangerously low, below 49.6Hz, on three separate occasions. Prior to these near-misses the grid\u2019s frequency had not fallen to this extent for at least the last four years. National Grid had managed to avoid a wide-spread blackout until now by triggering a \u201clow frequency event\u201d which sends out a call to contracted energy companies for immediate back up, with only 10 seconds\u2019 notice. A spokesman for National Grid said the frequency shocks were independent events, and said there is \u201cno trend or prediction of more frequency excursions\u201d. Why were rail lines hit particularly hard? The power outage may have lasted less than an hour, but travel disruption across the country caused major delays for railways well into Friday night. Nick King, a director for Network Rail, said the blackout caused a short-term loss of power to its signalling systems and power supply equipment across a wide area of the rail network. In some places its backup systems restarted but still needed an engineer to manually reset trains that had been brought to a halt by the blackout. \u201cMany of these trains were unable to restart on their own and had to be attended by an engineer and this caused significant disruption across parts of the network. We worked flat out with train operator colleagues and the British Transport Police to safely get passengers off impacted trains,\u201d he said. In some instances engineers needed to travel long distances to specific trains left stranded by the blackout. The blocked routes delayed train schedules across the network while the system was reset. Does the blackout raise questions marks over renewables? There is no question that the UK will need to increase its use of renewable energy sources to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. But there are questions over whether National Grid has done enough to adapt to the change renewable energy is bringing to the energy system. High volumes of renewable energy can make it more difficult for National Grid to balance the frequency of the grid, which was originally built to accommodate fossil fuel power plants. To prepare for the UK\u2019s energy transition National Grid has developed \u201cfrequency response\u201d tools \u2013 such as quick-fire backup supplies of extra electricity \u2013 which should make it technically possible to run the energy system without any fossil fuels by 2025. Energy experts have suggested that National Grid may need to change its \u201crules of thumb\u201d which govern how much electricity it keeps in reserve to manage the frequency of the grid as renewable energy plays a larger role. Experts have been clear though: there is no suggestion that wind power is an unreliable source of electricity. Does this strengthen the case for nationalising National Grid? Some Labour MPs have pointed to the blackouts and subsequent rail chaos as further evidence that the privatisation of national utilities has failed. The opposition party plans to renationalise energy networks and the railways amid criticism that private companies are providing poor service while hiking up consumer costs. According to energy industry sources the unprecedented political pressure on National Grid to keep costs down may have played a role in making the blackout more likely. Some of the energy companies which provide backup services to help keep the lights on have warned that National Grid is being too tough on costs. Steve Shine, chairman of Anesco, a battery company, said: \u201cWhat is needed is a greater volume of faster response services, which can be called into action when the frequency drops. This would have prevented the need to turn the power off.\u201d",

Simon\u2019s voice may not be what it was in the late \u201960s, and it has never soared like Art Garfunkel\u2019s (Simon\u2019s former collaborator originally performed the song). But in this tune and throughout the set, Simon used his vocal limitations to his advantage, trading vocal acrobatics for a storyteller\u2019s patter.</p> <p>The set\u2019s most memorable moments came in a five-song encore that felt like an audition for a permanent place in American cultural history.</p> <p>Graceland had its familiar blend of optimism and melancholy; Still Crazy After All These Years felt like a sigh of satisfaction.

The presidential election is due to take place in October.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez secured 47.4% of the vote, against Macri\u2019s 32.3%.</p> <p>Financial analysts said the prospect of a populist left-leaning government taking over in Buenos Aires could raise the chances of the country defaulting on its debt, which caused markets to slump in response.</p> <p>Shares in Argentinian companies also fell sharply on Monday, with the country\u2019s Merval stock index tumbling by almost 30%. The cost of insuring government bonds from default spiked, and the price of a 10-year government bond denominated in US dollars fell by between 18 and 20 cents to trade around 60 cents on the dollar.</p> <p>Edward Glossop, a Latin America economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe comprehensive victory for Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in Argentina\u2019s primary election paves the way for the return to leftwing populism that many investors fear.\u201d</p> <p>Other emerging market currencies including the Turkish lira and South African rand fell on foreign exchanges as investors bet that an Argentine debt default might rattle global financial markets.</p> <p>Argentina and several other developing nations have come under growing pressure over their high levels of foreign currency debt. The US dollar has appreciated in value as the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/24/fed-chairman-defends-rate-rise-policy-after-attack-by-trump\">Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates</a>, which has made it more expensive for these countries to repay their dollar-denominated debts.</p> <p>Macri, the son of a self-made construction tycoon, had made \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/29/argentina-mauricio-macri-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-election-year\">zero inflation</a>\u201d a campaign pledge before he came to power in 2015. In reality it has soared to more than 50% as the peso has weakened.</p> <p>Considered a market-friendly leader, Macri has used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/argentina-austerity-peso-crisis-macri\">austerity measures</a> in an effort to stem the country\u2019s currency crisis, provoking an angry public response.</p> <p>Argentina relies on support from the International Monetary Fund through a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/argentina-imf-biggest-loan\">$57bn (\u00a347.2bn) loan</a> intended to shore up the country\u2019s ailing finances.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez has said he could rework the agreement with the IMF should he beat Macri in October, while the prospect of Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner returning to power has also rattled investor confidence in owning Argentinian assets.</p> <p>The former president imposed strict currency controls that hit investment during her 2007-2015 administration. She also feuded with the country\u2019s key farming sector over export taxes and was leader during a multi-year standoff with Argentinian government bond holders.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez said the market reactions were in response to Macri\u2019s failure running the economy. \u201cMarkets react badly when they realise they were scammed. We are living a fictitious economy and the government is not giving answers,\u201d Reuters reported him as saying.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2019 because the presidential election is due to take place in October, not next month as an earlier version said.

A stronger than expected victory for Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, whose running mate is the former populist leader, triggered a 30% fall in the value of the peso, which hit a fresh record low against the US dollar on the global money markets. Fern\u00e1ndez dominated the poll against the centre-right president, Mauricio Macri, who has struggled to revitalise the economy and curtail high inflation. The presidential election is due to take place in October. Fern\u00e1ndez secured 47.4% of the vote, against Macri\u2019s 32.3%. Financial analysts said the prospect of a populist left-leaning government taking over in Buenos Aires could raise the chances of the country defaulting on its debt, which caused markets to slump in response. Shares in Argentinian companies also fell sharply on Monday, with the country\u2019s Merval stock index tumbling by almost 30%. The cost of insuring government bonds from default spiked, and the price of a 10-year government bond denominated in US dollars fell by between 18 and 20 cents to trade around 60 cents on the dollar. Edward Glossop, a Latin America economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe comprehensive victory for Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in Argentina\u2019s primary election paves the way for the return to leftwing populism that many investors fear.\u201d Other emerging market currencies including the Turkish lira and South African rand fell on foreign exchanges as investors bet that an Argentine debt default might rattle global financial markets. Argentina and several other developing nations have come under growing pressure over their high levels of foreign currency debt. The US dollar has appreciated in value as the US Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates, which has made it more expensive for these countries to repay their dollar-denominated debts. Macri, the son of a self-made construction tycoon, had made \u201czero inflation\u201d a campaign pledge before he came to power in 2015. In reality it has soared to more than 50% as the peso has weakened. Considered a market-friendly leader, Macri has used austerity measures in an effort to stem the country\u2019s currency crisis, provoking an angry public response. Argentina relies on support from the International Monetary Fund through a $57bn (\u00a347.2bn) loan intended to shore up the country\u2019s ailing finances. Fern\u00e1ndez has said he could rework the agreement with the IMF should he beat Macri in October, while the prospect of Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner returning to power has also rattled investor confidence in owning Argentinian assets. The former president imposed strict currency controls that hit investment during her 2007-2015 administration. She also feuded with the country\u2019s key farming sector over export taxes and was leader during a multi-year standoff with Argentinian government bond holders. Fern\u00e1ndez said the market reactions were in response to Macri\u2019s failure running the economy. \u201cMarkets react badly when they realise they were scammed. We are living a fictitious economy and the government is not giving answers,\u201d Reuters reported him as saying. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2019 because the presidential election is due to take place in October, not next month as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

Osman Ahmed Nur, 19, was found dead on 10 May 2018 in a communal area of a young people\u2019s hostel in Camden, north London, run by One Housing.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s cities are straining under the weight of the country\u2019s rapid population growth, with a major audit finding that $600bn in new spending is needed to keep pace with demand over the next 15 years. Joining calls from the Reserve Bank governor for the Coalition to prioritise spending on infrastructure, the head of Infrastructure Australia, Romilly Madew, says an audit undertaken by her agency has highlighted the need for significant government investment. \u201cOn the infrastructure priority list there are already 103 initiatives sitting there that have been identified by the states and territories, and that means there is a pipeline of infrastructure that has been identified that could go,\u201d Madew said. She also pointed to spending on maintenance, public transport rolling stock and enabling electric vehicles as possible ways to stimulate the economy through infrastructure spending. The audit, to be released on Tuesday, has found that infrastructure is being particularly stretched on the urban fringes of Australia\u2019s four largest cities \u2013 Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 where the majority of the country\u2019s population boom is occurring. The problem is being compounded by ageing assets, rising road congestion, public transport crowding and growing demands on so-called \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d, such as schools, hospitals and parks, as more people move into cities. The IA report warns that in order for Australia to cope with a forecast population of 31.4 million people in 15 years\u2019 time \u2013 an increase of 23.7% \u2013 spending on infrastructure will need to remain at about $40bn a year. About three-quarters of the forecast population growth over the coming 15 years is projected to occur in Australia\u2019s four biggest cities, with most if this in Sydney and Melbourne. Without action to manage the growth, the cost of road congestion will grow $18.9bn to $38.8bn in 2031. Public transport crowding is also on track to increase fivefold over the same period, costing more than $800m a year. \u201cPopulation growth offers enormous economic opportunities but the risk is that our infrastructure fails to keep pace with demand, and this impacts productivity, quality of life and the liveability of our cities and regional centres,\u201d Madew said. She said that the country also needed to look at a large and growing backlog of infrastructure maintenance across health, water and transport, but the cost was difficult to quantify. \u201cIt is clear that changing and growing demand and a maintenance backlog is putting unprecedented pressure on infrastructure services.\u201d The audit also looked at the cost for households for infrastructure, with analysis of the household expenditure survey finding the average household spent over $314 each week on infrastructure in 2015-16 \u2013 or $16,000 annually. While most people report concern about energy costs \u2013 which have risen 50% over the past decade \u2013 most of the expense is related to car purchase and running costs. The audit found that the cost of infrastructure was not affordable for the lowest 20% of income earners, who are spending around a third of what they earn on energy, transport, water and telecommunications. Remote and regional Australians were also feeling the pinch, with two-thirds of the continent not having mobile phone coverage, compared to 99.4% of premises. About 43% of farms have no or little mobile phone coverage, with 14% having no access at all. Nineteen per cent of very remote Indigenous communities lacked water for the preparation of food or for clothes washing and 6% lacked water for personal hygiene. Peter Colacino, Infrastructure Australia\u2019s executive director of policy and research, said that while investment in infrastructure was occurring at record levels, with $123bn of construction work commenced since 2015, the challenge facing policymakers was to maintain this level of spending. \u201cWe see access improving, quality is quite good compared to comparable nations and affordability has improved \u2026 but all of that said, as we are in a process of rapid population growth, of changing technology needs, changing user preferences, slowing economic growth and the expectation that infrastructure can boost productivity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that you are ever finished building is just not right, infrastructure investment will be needed into the future with changing expectations of the economy.\u201d Madew said the infrastructure boom that Australia was experiencing was \u201cthe new normal\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow minister for infrastructure, Catherine King, said the audit confirmed the need for the Coalition to produce a \u201creal plan for infrastructure to protect jobs, curb rising congestion and stimulate the economy\u201d. \u201cLabor welcomes the extensive piece of work by Infrastructure Australia that includes a broad review of economic and social infrastructure and confirms the need for infrastructure investment decisions to be based on clear evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter six years of cuts and inaction, the audit is another stark reminder of the real pressures in the system now.\u201d The infrastructure minister, Michael McCormack, said the report did not account for an additional $23bn in new infrastructure investment announced in the 2019-20 budget, including more than 160 urban congestion projects. \u201cAustralia has always been a desirable place to live, work and raise a family both for people raised here and migrants and we are seeing that more than ever, which is why the Liberal and Nationals government is investing $100bn over 10 years in transport infrastructure across Australia to manage our growing population,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Infrastructure Australia calling for sustained investment in infrastructure, we are maintaining our historically high investment on transport infrastructure which now averages over $10bn a year over the forward estimates, and have established a 10-year rolling pipeline to enable planning and certainty of future investment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Friday the Reserve Bank executive appeared before the House economics committee, and wages growth was high on the agenda \u2013 especially the lack of growth. But while the governor of the bank did suggest hope for wages growth of at least 3%, the RBA\u2019s own prediction released on Friday afternoon suggested that would not occur for some time. One aspect that has been abundantly clear ever since the budget was handed down is that the government\u2019s projections for wage growth are wildly optimistic. That optimism helps improve projection for tax revenue, but the Reserve Bank is not so concerned about pumping up the budget surplus numbers through inflated wage growth estimates. The April budget predicted that wage growth through to June this year would be 2.5%, compared to the latest estimate by the RBA in last Friday\u2019s statement on monetary policy of 2.3%: Given the current seasonally adjusted annual wages growth is 2.3%, to get to 2.5% (even if rounded up) would require the June quarter to have the strongest quarterly growth for five years. We will find that out on Wednesday when the ABS releases the latest wage price index figures, but it is the predictions for the next two years where the RBA and the government really diverge. By this time next year the government predicts wages to be growing at a rate of 2.75%, while the RBA expects just 2.3%. By June 2021, the government predicts a jump to growth of 3.25%, while the RBA sees merely a rise to 2.4%. At this point we should note that the past budgets have not been particularly successful at predicting wages growth: The 2017-18 budget, for example, was predicting that by now we would be experiencing 3% annual wages growth. But this difference in outlook aside, the RBA and the government also have quite different approaches to how to get wages growth improving. At the basic level the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, noted that we should be aiming for around 3.5% annual wages growth. The reasoning is quite simple \u2013 we target an inflation growth of 2.5% and productivity annual growth of at least 1%. And as Lowe told the House economics committee on Friday, \u201c2\u00bd plus 1 equals 3\u00bd. I think that\u2019s a reasonable medium-term aspiration.\u201d In essence Lowe is arguing that workers should get wage rises in line with inflation \u2013 to ensure real wages do not fall \u2013 and that any rise above inflation is determined by productivity growth. This makes sense. Over the past three years productivity has grown on average each year by just 0.6% and with underlying inflation growing at 1.6% that gets up to 2.2% which is around the level of current wages growth: But while at the moment it appears that the equation is working, over the past decade inflation and productivity combined has grown on average by 3.6% each year, compared with wage growth over that period growing by just 2.8% on average: So it certainly appears that workers have not received the wages growth they were entitled. Part of the reason Lowe suggests is that \u201cwe are in a situation now where wage norms have drifted down to two to 2\u00bd%\u201d ie that \u201cmost people are accepting wage increases of two to 2\u00bd%\u201d. This has the impact of keeping wages down because of an almost structural change of acceptance. Whereas once real wage growth was the bare minimum, now it has become almost the bare maximum. Lowe noted that one other issue is that of public sector wage growth, which has been stifled due to imposed limits \u2013 such as that of the federal Workplace Bargaining Policy 2018, which \u201callows for remuneration increases to be negotiated up to an average of 2.0% per annum\u201d. Given the lowest target level for inflation is 2%, this in effect is a policy that locks in real wage falls for the Australian public service. A look at the wage growth of public sector workers in the ACT (the majority of whom work for the commonwealth) shows just how greatly this has stifled wage growth even below that of public sector workers elsewhere in the country: Lowe noted that \u201cthe public sector wage norm I think is to some degree influencing private sector outcomes as well \u2013 because, after all, a third of the workforce work directly or indirectly for the public sector\u201d. But while this is an area of concern, what clearly is holding back wages at the moment is the lack of demand and growth in the economy. At best the Reserve Bank now predicts us achieving GDP growth of above 3% by the end of 2021, and household consumption growth not to reach that previous average level at all in the next two years: Such low levels of growth are unlikely to be enough to lower unemployment or underemployment and the RBA does not anticipate the unemployment rate falling below 4.9% before 2022. In his hearing before the economics committee Lowe noted that would be above the 4.5% rate of \u201cfull employment\u201d and that we would \u201cneed to get down to an unemployment rate of 4.5% to have wage growth consistent with the inflation target\u201d. This suggests we still have a very long wait till we see wage growth back above 3%, especially if the task is left to the bank alone. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

The police minister, David Elliott, and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/totally-false-finance-minister-under-fire-over-views-on-abortion-bill-20190804-p52do3.html\">finance minister, Damien Tudehope</a>, a staunch Catholic and father of nine, are also said to be deeply unhappy.</p> <p>No doubt these members genuinely hold their views against abortion. But it is worth noting none has sought to reverse the practice of abortion in NSW via a private members bill. The reason? It would be political suicide.</p> <p>Instead the state has been inching towards reform since 2015, when the first unsuccessful attempt to make abortion a health issue, not a legal one, began.</p> <p>The rancour within the Liberals is being stirred by commentators who have adopted the age-old tactic of giving the disgruntled few prominence and then declaring it a big problem. It worked to undermine the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on energy reform and climate change.</p> <p>Their attack has been to accuse Berejiklian and anyone who voted for the bill of supporting infanticide, by refusing to support an amendment that made abortion for the purpose of selecting the sex of a child a crime.</p> <p> Parliament voted overwhelmingly for a study to assess the issue and consider whether further action is needed</p> <p>The study cited by Berejiklian\u2019s critics as \u201cproof\u201d of abortion being used for sex selection is <a href=\"https://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2018/release/gender-bias-leads-to-more-male-births\">an epidemiological study by La Trobe University</a> in Victoria in 2015.</p> <p>It found that while the naturally occurring ratio between the sexes worldwide is 105 boys born to every 100 girls, in Victoria there were 108 and 109 boys born to Indian- and Chinese-born mothers between 1999 and 2015.</p> <p>The imbalance of male births among these mothers became more pronounced, rising to 122 and 125 boys born to every 100 girls, if the mother had two or more previous births, the study found.</p> <p>Abortion is one way a sex of the baby can be selected; it can also occur through IVF. The study did not delve into how sex selection was happening, whether it was as a result of procedures in Australia, or the possible motives of the parents.</p> <p>Any law banning parents from selecting the sex of the child might be extremely difficult to police, as Victoria has found. Dr Kristina Edvardsson, the lead researcher on the La Trobe study, said the figures showed gender bias \u201chas remained persistent in Victoria despite legislation that bans people from choosing the sex of their child, other than for medical reasons\u201d.</p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped conservative commentators such as Peta Credlin seizing on the study.</p> <p>\u201cIs this really what we want for our country?

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian flew out of Sydney on a trade mission on Monday morning, leaving seething unhappiness in some parts of her Liberal party over the the bill to decriminalise abortion, which passed the lower house last week. But is it actually a revolt, as some media report, or a naked attempt to forge a new front in the culture wars led by the Daily Telegraph and Sky News? First, a reality check. The bill that passed the lower house of NSW parliament 59-31 (with the support of 19 Liberals) has not materially changed the situation in NSW, where abortions were available on much the same terms as other states, but anachronistically remained on the criminal statute books. As polls have revealed over the past 50 years, a majority of people in NSW support decriminalisation \u2013 even a Facebook poll in the Telegraph confirmed majority (55%) support. But there has been a concerted campaign from the Tele and News Corp commentators to paint the split among Liberals during the conscience vote as a fundamental fissure that Berejiklian (who voted for reform) would deeply regret. The bill now faces its final hurdle \u2013 a vote in the upper house next Tuesday \u2013 and the conservatives are in full cry. The vote will be tight, but those counting the numbers say it is likely to pass narrowly. Berejiklian\u2019s two loudest critics are Anthony Roberts, the counter-terrorism minister, and backbencher Matthew Mason-Cox, though a handful of others are also said to be upset at both the speed with which the debate was brought on and its outcome. Roberts was demoted by Berejiklian from planning minister to his present role after the March election, while Mason-Cox has languished on the backbench. The police minister, David Elliott, and finance minister, Damien Tudehope, a staunch Catholic and father of nine, are also said to be deeply unhappy. No doubt these members genuinely hold their views against abortion. But it is worth noting none has sought to reverse the practice of abortion in NSW via a private members bill. The reason? It would be political suicide. Instead the state has been inching towards reform since 2015, when the first unsuccessful attempt to make abortion a health issue, not a legal one, began. The rancour within the Liberals is being stirred by commentators who have adopted the age-old tactic of giving the disgruntled few prominence and then declaring it a big problem. It worked to undermine the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on energy reform and climate change. Their attack has been to accuse Berejiklian and anyone who voted for the bill of supporting infanticide, by refusing to support an amendment that made abortion for the purpose of selecting the sex of a child a crime. Parliament voted overwhelmingly for a study to assess the issue and consider whether further action is needed The study cited by Berejiklian\u2019s critics as \u201cproof\u201d of abortion being used for sex selection is an epidemiological study by La Trobe University in Victoria in 2015. It found that while the naturally occurring ratio between the sexes worldwide is 105 boys born to every 100 girls, in Victoria there were 108 and 109 boys born to Indian- and Chinese-born mothers between 1999 and 2015. The imbalance of male births among these mothers became more pronounced, rising to 122 and 125 boys born to every 100 girls, if the mother had two or more previous births, the study found. Abortion is one way a sex of the baby can be selected; it can also occur through IVF. The study did not delve into how sex selection was happening, whether it was as a result of procedures in Australia, or the possible motives of the parents. Any law banning parents from selecting the sex of the child might be extremely difficult to police, as Victoria has found. Dr Kristina Edvardsson, the lead researcher on the La Trobe study, said the figures showed gender bias \u201chas remained persistent in Victoria despite legislation that bans people from choosing the sex of their child, other than for medical reasons\u201d. But that hasn\u2019t stopped conservative commentators such as Peta Credlin seizing on the study. \u201cIs this really what we want for our country? It wasn\u2019t that long ago that feminists marched in the street against the practice of infanticide of baby girls, particularly in India and China; yet today, the same protesters stand with placards outside the NSW parliament hoping to do the same thing here,\u201d Credlin thundered over the weekend. \u201cAs far as political errors go, this is epic and will haunt the premier for the rest of her time in public office. As inevitably they do, the media will move on but her colleagues and the Liberal party\u2019s core supporters will never forget, or forgive, this fundamental breach of trust on the bill as a crime against humanity,\u201d she warned. This is not a revolt. This is posturing by the right, looking for a new war to prosecute now they have lost the battle over same-sex marriage and are gradually losing the war over climate change in the face of overwhelming evidence.",

      "bodyText": "An Australian coalmine has nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years without penalty under a Coalition climate policy that promised to put a limit on industrial pollution. Mining company Anglo American was given the green light to increase emissions at its Moranbah North mine, in central Queensland, twice since 2016, according to documents released under freedom of information laws. The pollution increase was approved under a scheme known as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, which promised to ensure cuts paid for by taxpayers through the government\u2019s \u201cdirect action\u201d emissions reduction fund were not just wiped out by rises elsewhere. The documents show Anglo American was approved to increase its annual emissions from 1.3m tonnes to more than 2.3m tonnes a year. An equivalent cut in carbon pollution to offset that increase would have cost taxpayers $13.7m. The Australian Conservation Foundation, which received the documents, said the failure to impose a hard pollution cap on big companies was the main reason national emissions were rising each year at odds with the government\u2019s pledge at the Paris climate summit. The documents show Anglo American exceeded its safeguard limit of 1.30m tonnes in 2016/17 and would have been required to buy carbon credits to make up the difference but applied to the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the scheme, to have its baseline retrospectively set at 1.36m tonnes. The change was approved in January 2018. In 2017/18, emissions from the site jumped to 2.33m tonnes, a 71% increase in a year. The company was granted a new baseline, confirmed in February this year, that allows it to emit 6.7m tonnes over the three years to June 2020. An earlier analysis by consultants RepuTex found heavy industrial sites covered by the safeguard mechanism had, in total, been approved emissions limit increases of nearly a third. Gavan McFadzean, the Conservation Foundation\u2019s climate change and clean energy program manager, said the Anglo American case showed the government\u2019s climate policies were failing. \u201cFor years, experts have warned the so-called safeguards are full of holes and the pollution increase without penalty at Moranbah North is evidence of this,\u201d he said. McFadzean said loopholes in the safeguard mechanism should be eradicated and emissions limits reduced over time, as recommended by government agency the Climate Change Authority. \u201cThis is a bare minimum first step towards a comprehensive Australian climate change strategy that will bring down our pollution to zero by 2050,\u201d he said. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, did not directly address questions about the purpose of the safeguard mechanism. In a statement, he said the government was spending $3.5bn on a climate solutions package and had mapped out how it would deliver its Paris commitment. \u201cWe will meet our international obligations without wrecking our economy or offshoring jobs and industry,\u201d he said. Moranbah North is a 20-year-old underground mine in the Bowen Basin that produces coking coal for export. More than 90% of its emissions are methane, a potent but relatively short-lived greenhouse gas, released during mining. A spokeswoman for Anglo American said the company had invested in methane capture technology over the past five years, including using the gas for electricity for about 120,000 homes. She said the company supported the operation of the safeguard mechanism and that it was designed to accommodate economic growth. \u201c[It] recognises that as operating conditions materially change at a mine, the comparison point or baseline should be adjusted. In the case of Moranbah North, production has doubled and we are mining in an area that is geologically twice as gassy,\u201d she said. While emissions rise in the industrial sector, the government is struggling to attract interest in its main policy supposed to cut pollution, the emissions reduction fund. At its most recent auction it signed only three contracts for projects that, combined, promise to deliver only 0.06% of the cuts that Scott Morrison says the fund will achieve by 2030. The Coalition has shifted how it describes the safeguard mechanism since it was introduced. In 2016, the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, said it would ensure the emissions reduction fund was not offset by significant increases above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. A policy document released in February said the mechanism required Australia\u2019s largest emitters to \u201cmeasure, report and manage\u201d their emissions, not that it would limit pollution. When the scheme began most sites received baselines equivalent to their highest pollution level between 2009 and 2014. Companies that went beyond their baseline had to buy carbon credits to offset the breach. This has happened in a handful of cases. But companies could also apply to increase their baseline if their production levels were expected to rise or they had started operating more recently. After consulting with industry, the government announced in March it would allow all companies to adopt a calculated baseline to \u201cimprove operation of the scheme, reduce costs for business and make it fairer and simpler\u201d. Labor promised before the election that if elected it would reduce industrial emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism by 45% by 2030 by setting tougher limits, but did not spell out how it would have reached the goal. The Coalition does not have a target for the safeguard mechanism, and appears to have dropped Greg Hunt\u2019s plan for it to be used to cut industrial emissions by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030. The government has a national target of a 26-28% cut by 2030, but most analysts believe it will not reach the target under current policies. Scientists say even this target is not enough for Australia to be playing its part in meeting the goals of the Paris agreement.",

Saudi Aramco\u2019s profits for the six months ending in June were down from $53.2bn in the first half of last year owing to lower oil prices, but were still well ahead of the world\u2019s six biggest listed oil companies combined. Khalid al-Dabbagh, a senior executive at Aramco, said the results proved the world\u2019s most profitable company was ready for an initial public offering whenever its shareholders agreed market conditions were \u201coptimal\u201d. \u201cWe have delivered strong and unmatched financial performance despite lower oil prices and challenging market conditions,\u201d he said. He used Aramco\u2019s first ever investor call to signal the company\u2019s readiness to list on the international markets after resurrecting the plans earlier this summer. Aramco had said earlier this year it would consider a market listing before 2021 once a planned merger with petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp (Sabic) was finalised. Al-Dabbagh said the inaugural call was an important step in its programme to \u201cstrengthen communications with investors\u201d. \u201cThe company is ready for the IPO,\u201d he added. \u201cThe timing of the IPO itself, this is a shareholder issue.

Aramco is in high demand from investors, despite concerns over the Saudi state\u2019s human rights record in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the war in the Yemen, due to its vast reserves of oil which is one of the cheapest in the world to produce. In 2018 investors placed orders worth $100bn for $12bn of bonds. Its latest results show that it produced 13.2m barrels of oil a day in the first half of the year, more than four times the rate of production from rivals such as ExxonMobil, which produced 3.9m a day over the same period. Aramco plans to maintain its position as the world\u2019s leading oil company, while growing its presence in gas and oil refining. It laid out plans to take a 20% stake in the oil-to-chemicals business of India\u2019s Reliance Industries at a value of $75bn including debt, which would be \u201cone of the largest foreign investments ever made in India\u201d. \u201cIndia is a large country with a large demand, and a growing demand [for energy],\u201d Al-Dabbagh added. Saudi Arabia plans to modernise its economy by diversifying, moving away from a near-total reliance on oil revenues and opening the kingdom to international investment.

The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, said late on Monday that \u201cnobody wants to sit at the table with Renzi\u201d, while the party\u2019s founder, Beppe Grillo, called him a vulture.

Knowing the League could soon seize power, factions from within M5S and the rival PD had discussed teaming up to delay elections by carving out a caretaker government in order to pass the 2020 budget. The PD faction was led by the former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who still wields influence within the party but is unpopular with voters. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, said late on Monday that \u201cnobody wants to sit at the table with Renzi\u201d, while the party\u2019s founder, Beppe Grillo, called him a vulture. The PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, also ruled out such a move, saying it would be a \u201cgift to the dangerous right\u201d, while appealing for unity within his party. Di Maio rallied his MPs on Monday morning and had reportedly accused Salvini of betraying the government contract for his own interests. Di Maio said on Friday that he favoured a return to the polls, but that first he first wanted parliament to adopt a reform to cut the number of senators and deputies from 951 to 605. The decision to dissolve the government and call fresh elections rests with the president, Sergio Mattarella. He could install a technical government, but that option also tends to be unpopular with voters. Salvini has been touring Italy\u2019s beaches since last week, calling on supporters to give the League, which is nearing 39% in polls, \u201cfull power\u201d to \u201csave Italy\u201d. He said he would meet his allies, the Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia, this week. The three parties joined forces before national elections in March 2018 and compete together at the regional level. A coalition between the League and the Brothers of Italy, a party with a neo-fascist lineage, would create a fully far-right government in a major western European nation. \u201cWe genuinely rule out that there is any life left in this parliament and we consider elections in October as a baseline scenario,\u201d Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political consultancy, said in a note. Franco Pavoncello, a political science professor and the president of John Cabot University in Rome, said: \u201cThere are people who don\u2019t want elections right away, others who want them desperately and others who are sort of neutral. But I think it\u2019s a long way to Tipperary for the elections \u2026 the last time Italy held a vote in the autumn was in 1919, just before Benito Mussolini\u2019s victory.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Every now and then, August belies its reputation as a sleepy month when nothing happens and throws up an event that shakes financial markets.</p> <p>The Latin American debt crisis began in August 1982; oil prices soared after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990; the Asian debt crisis had its genesis in the same month in Thailand seven years later. Then there are the crises that simmer away in August and finally come to the boil in September: the buildup to Black Wednesday in 1990; the weeks leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p> <p>This year, those looking around in August for ill omens for the global economy are spoilt for choice. There\u2019s the fact that in the United States the president is at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/26/trump-criticises-fed-chairman-powell-for-trying-to-be-tough\">loggerheads</a> with the man running the central bank. There\u2019s the possibility of a general election in Italy that will produce an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/italian-politicians-move-to-scupper-salvini-election-push\">extreme hard-right </a>government that will shake the foundations of the eurozone. There is, of course, the risk of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/11/mps-opposing-no-deal-brexit-will-need-new-tactics-report-says\">no-deal Brexit</a>.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s China, which, at the sharp end of Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/02/global-markets-take-fright-as-trump-ramps-up-us-china-trade-war\">trade policy</a>, is also struggling to cope with the escalating political unrest in Hong Kong and suffering from a more rapid slowdown than official figures would suggest.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweets claiming that companies and capital are leaving the world\u2019s second biggest economy tend to be dismissed as mere White House bombast. But a look under the bonnet of the Chinese economy suggest there is some truth in what the US president is saying.</p> <p>Two recent developments are of note. The first is the decision in late May by the People\u2019s Bank of China to take over Baoshang Bank. Although the central bank\u2019s deposit guarantee avoided a bank run, the bailout did not prevent serious tensions in the interbank market \u2013 rekindling memories of how the unwillingness of western banks to lend to one another was a key feature of the global financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p>The second development involves Evergrande, China\u2019s biggest property company, which expanded as a result of the cheap money it could obtain from the country\u2019s shadow banking system. But since 2018, shadow banking has been reined in on the direct instruction of China\u2019s president Xi Jinping and property companies have been borrowing offshore in US dollars.</p> <p>All of which makes the decision of Beijing earlier this month to allow the yuan to fall below seven to the dollar so interesting. All debt crises need a trigger to set them off, and this might just be it, since a devaluing currency makes it more expensive to pay back debts denominated in foreign currencies. And when your debts are as big as China\u2019s, that\u2019s potentially a very big deal.</p> <h2>Saudi Aramco\u2019s partial lifting of the veil</h2> <p>The veil of secrecy surrounding the world\u2019s most profitable company was lifted when <a href=\"ttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/12/oil-producer-saudi-aramco-makes-47bn-half-year-profit\">Saudi Aramco</a> held a results briefing for the first time. Well, not quite.</p> <p>For a start, while investors were allowed to ask questions, the journalists listening in were not. And the first couple of questions \u2013 \u201cWhy are you so profitable?\u201d and \u201cHow do you manage to be so environmentally friendly?\u201d \u2013 were not exactly of the hardball variety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the fact that the two non-questions were asked by JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley \u2013 both central to Saudi Aramco\u2019s plan for a massive share flotation \u2013 might lead a cynic to think they had been planted.</p> <p>When it comes, the initial public offering might value the company at as much as $2tn, and will allow the company to step up a diversification out of oil production without which it will not be the world\u2019s most profitable company for much longer.</p> <p>The question that should have been asked, but wasn\u2019t, is this: what, given growing pressure on governments to tackle global heating, are the chances of Saudi Aramco still being a going concern by the midpoint of this century?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every now and then, August belies its reputation as a sleepy month when nothing happens and throws up an event that shakes financial markets. The Latin American debt crisis began in August 1982; oil prices soared after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990; the Asian debt crisis had its genesis in the same month in Thailand seven years later. Then there are the crises that simmer away in August and finally come to the boil in September: the buildup to Black Wednesday in 1990; the weeks leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. This year, those looking around in August for ill omens for the global economy are spoilt for choice. There\u2019s the fact that in the United States the president is at loggerheads with the man running the central bank. There\u2019s the possibility of a general election in Italy that will produce an extreme hard-right government that will shake the foundations of the eurozone. There is, of course, the risk of a no-deal Brexit. And then there\u2019s China, which, at the sharp end of Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policy, is also struggling to cope with the escalating political unrest in Hong Kong and suffering from a more rapid slowdown than official figures would suggest. Trump\u2019s tweets claiming that companies and capital are leaving the world\u2019s second biggest economy tend to be dismissed as mere White House bombast. But a look under the bonnet of the Chinese economy suggest there is some truth in what the US president is saying. Two recent developments are of note. The first is the decision in late May by the People\u2019s Bank of China to take over Baoshang Bank. Although the central bank\u2019s deposit guarantee avoided a bank run, the bailout did not prevent serious tensions in the interbank market \u2013 rekindling memories of how the unwillingness of western banks to lend to one another was a key feature of the global financial crisis of 2008. The second development involves Evergrande, China\u2019s biggest property company, which expanded as a result of the cheap money it could obtain from the country\u2019s shadow banking system. But since 2018, shadow banking has been reined in on the direct instruction of China\u2019s president Xi Jinping and property companies have been borrowing offshore in US dollars. All of which makes the decision of Beijing earlier this month to allow the yuan to fall below seven to the dollar so interesting. All debt crises need a trigger to set them off, and this might just be it, since a devaluing currency makes it more expensive to pay back debts denominated in foreign currencies. And when your debts are as big as China\u2019s, that\u2019s potentially a very big deal. Saudi Aramco\u2019s partial lifting of the veil The veil of secrecy surrounding the world\u2019s most profitable company was lifted when Saudi Aramco held a results briefing for the first time. Well, not quite. For a start, while investors were allowed to ask questions, the journalists listening in were not. And the first couple of questions \u2013 \u201cWhy are you so profitable?\u201d and \u201cHow do you manage to be so environmentally friendly?\u201d \u2013 were not exactly of the hardball variety. Indeed, the fact that the two non-questions were asked by JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley \u2013 both central to Saudi Aramco\u2019s plan for a massive share flotation \u2013 might lead a cynic to think they had been planted. When it comes, the initial public offering might value the company at as much as $2tn, and will allow the company to step up a diversification out of oil production without which it will not be the world\u2019s most profitable company for much longer. The question that should have been asked, but wasn\u2019t, is this: what, given growing pressure on governments to tackle global heating, are the chances of Saudi Aramco still being a going concern by the midpoint of this century?",

Here are a few of the issues that this first round of matches brought up, some contrived, some actually rather serious.</p> <h2><strong>Doing away with the shades of grey</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bc711a5b9fc4510b67decdd64086d670809afb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bc711a5b9fc4510b67decdd64086d670809afb7/0_13_2411_1446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raheem Sterling\u2019s offside meant a \u2018goal\u2019 from Gabriel Jesus was disallowed against West Ham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Sterling\u2019s offside meant a \u2018goal\u2019 from Gabriel Jesus was disallowed against West Ham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s start with the contrived. Gabriel Jesus had a goal disallowed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against West Ham on Saturday</a> after Raheem Sterling was ruled offside by the width of a unicorn\u2019s horn. It meant the first thwarted celebration in the Premier League (more of that in a bit) but also provoked \u201clively\u201d debate.</p> <p>Football may be a game of opinions but it is always better when they are based on something factual. Instead, on Match of the Day, Ian Wright (to pick one, prominent, well-remunerated example) left facts to one side and luxuriated in emotion instead as he decried \u201coffside by an armpit\u201d.</p> <p>Wright\u2019s co-pundit Alan Shearer, a man well suited to his new role as sombre face of killjoy regulations, pointed out that there was no problem with VAR in this instance. It was applying the law and it was wrong to conflate one with the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/aug/12/big-guns-off-to-a-flyer-in-premier-league-amid-var-confusion-football-weekly\">Big guns off to a flyer in Premier League amid VAR confusion \u2013\u00a0Football Weekly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Separate out the two, however, and Wright is still wrong. Not only is the rule the rule, it is there for a reason and that is to provide clarity. When Wright made the plea that Sterling \u201cgained no advantage\u201d by being offside by an armpit and Gary Lineker chimed in by calling for \u201cleeway\u201d, they were making emotional appeals that work for them but might be unpalatable to someone else.</p> <p>With a clear rule you know where you stand. With \u201cleeway\u201d and \u201ccommon sense\u201d you open the door to subjectivity. And when you do that, more decisions become contestable and controversial, great for pundits but bad for football in general and referees in particular. Grey areas are a field day for those who like the words \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d. That the Premier League has chosen to go the other way ought to be seen as a good thing.</p> <p><strong>Matchgoing fans at risk of losing emotional high</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfa564d567763ee91248bf662dafbe013e506b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa564d567763ee91248bf662dafbe013e506b25/0_86_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leander Dendoncker thought he had scored for Wolves \u2013 but the joy did not last.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leander Dendoncker thought he had scored for Wolves \u2013 but the joy did not last.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/JMP/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So that is the confected controversy. Now for the real thing. When Gabriel Jesus \u201cscored\u201d that \u201cgoal\u201d City fans in the London Stadium celebrated heartily. Those cheers were then stifled as the VAR check ran on and, finally, they were stolen by West Ham fans whooping at the news of it being disallowed.</p> <p>Celebrating a goal has traditionally been an experience that is logical and emotional. First comes the knowledge that your team has been successful, then comes the freedom to revel in it among a group of like-minded people. Celebrating a goal in a crowd on a terrace is one of the best things in life. VAR could ruin it.</p> <p>Disallowing a goal not just seconds but maybe minutes after it has been \u201cscored\u201d is going to have an effect on how fans celebrate. They are going to hold in the excitement. They are going to tell their brain not to jump to conclusions and their heart to keep calm. And if they do that, then the joyous chain reaction breaks down.</p> <p>VAR decisions will surely be made more quickly as people get used to the tech but will they be fast enough to preserve that split second of explosive euphoria? And with VAR obliged to check on every goal, such decisions will be frequent. Willy Boly\u2019s handball in the run-up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/11/leicester-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Wolves\u2019 \u201cgoal\u201d against Leicester</a> was missed by Andre Marriner but it came up so quickly \u2013 and at such an oblique angle \u2013 that many other referees would miss it too. In that situation VAR must intervene.</p> <p>This is a real problem but, unlike armpit offsides, it does not apply to all fans equally. Those watching at home have distractions. They can watch replays, get up and make a cup of tea, switch to another tab. For the casual viewer the \u201cdrama\u201d of whether a goal will stand or not might even be enjoyable. For those in the ground, however, it kills the very reason they spend time and money following their team. Being a fan is about celebrating goals; the whole thing changes without it.</p> <h2><strong>Dying swan is finally an endangered species</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b76a30569f271356e4861b3e5948af936ea72ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b76a30569f271356e4861b3e5948af936ea72ae3/0_10_1894_1136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miguel Almir\u00f3n\u2019s theatrics earned a yellow card against Arsenal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miguel Almir\u00f3n\u2019s theatrics earned a yellow card against Arsenal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, the good news: no one will have to endure Miguel Almir\u00f3n being \u201cclever\u201d in the box again. The Newcastle United forward tried to con Martin Atkinson on Sunday by diving during the first half of the Toon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/11/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 defeat against Arsenal</a>. Atkinson called simulation and booked the Paraguayan. But, even if he had missed it and awarded a penalty instead, VAR would have been obliged to check the challenge and would have spotted Almir\u00f3n falling, despite not being touched. The penalty box swan dive is now an endangered species. So that is something.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first weekend of VAR went well \u2013 in the sense that the new refereeing technology worked as it was supposed to. But does that mean everyone was happy? Hell, no! Here are a few of the issues that this first round of matches brought up, some contrived, some actually rather serious. Doing away with the shades of grey Let\u2019s start with the contrived. Gabriel Jesus had a goal disallowed against West Ham on Saturday after Raheem Sterling was ruled offside by the width of a unicorn\u2019s horn. It meant the first thwarted celebration in the Premier League (more of that in a bit) but also provoked \u201clively\u201d debate. Football may be a game of opinions but it is always better when they are based on something factual. Instead, on Match of the Day, Ian Wright (to pick one, prominent, well-remunerated example) left facts to one side and luxuriated in emotion instead as he decried \u201coffside by an armpit\u201d. Wright\u2019s co-pundit Alan Shearer, a man well suited to his new role as sombre face of killjoy regulations, pointed out that there was no problem with VAR in this instance. It was applying the law and it was wrong to conflate one with the other. Separate out the two, however, and Wright is still wrong. Not only is the rule the rule, it is there for a reason and that is to provide clarity. When Wright made the plea that Sterling \u201cgained no advantage\u201d by being offside by an armpit and Gary Lineker chimed in by calling for \u201cleeway\u201d, they were making emotional appeals that work for them but might be unpalatable to someone else. With a clear rule you know where you stand. With \u201cleeway\u201d and \u201ccommon sense\u201d you open the door to subjectivity. And when you do that, more decisions become contestable and controversial, great for pundits but bad for football in general and referees in particular. Grey areas are a field day for those who like the words \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d. That the Premier League has chosen to go the other way ought to be seen as a good thing. Matchgoing fans at risk of losing emotional high So that is the confected controversy. Now for the real thing. When Gabriel Jesus \u201cscored\u201d that \u201cgoal\u201d City fans in the London Stadium celebrated heartily. Those cheers were then stifled as the VAR check ran on and, finally, they were stolen by West Ham fans whooping at the news of it being disallowed. Celebrating a goal has traditionally been an experience that is logical and emotional. First comes the knowledge that your team has been successful, then comes the freedom to revel in it among a group of like-minded people. Celebrating a goal in a crowd on a terrace is one of the best things in life. VAR could ruin it. Disallowing a goal not just seconds but maybe minutes after it has been \u201cscored\u201d is going to have an effect on how fans celebrate. They are going to hold in the excitement. They are going to tell their brain not to jump to conclusions and their heart to keep calm. And if they do that, then the joyous chain reaction breaks down. VAR decisions will surely be made more quickly as people get used to the tech but will they be fast enough to preserve that split second of explosive euphoria? And with VAR obliged to check on every goal, such decisions will be frequent. Willy Boly\u2019s handball in the run-up to Wolves\u2019 \u201cgoal\u201d against Leicester was missed by Andre Marriner but it came up so quickly \u2013 and at such an oblique angle \u2013 that many other referees would miss it too. In that situation VAR must intervene. This is a real problem but, unlike armpit offsides, it does not apply to all fans equally. Those watching at home have distractions. They can watch replays, get up and make a cup of tea, switch to another tab. For the casual viewer the \u201cdrama\u201d of whether a goal will stand or not might even be enjoyable. For those in the ground, however, it kills the very reason they spend time and money following their team. Being a fan is about celebrating goals; the whole thing changes without it. Dying swan is finally an endangered species Finally, the good news: no one will have to endure Miguel Almir\u00f3n being \u201cclever\u201d in the box again. The Newcastle United forward tried to con Martin Atkinson on Sunday by diving during the first half of the Toon\u2019s 1-0 defeat against Arsenal. Atkinson called simulation and booked the Paraguayan. But, even if he had missed it and awarded a penalty instead, VAR would have been obliged to check the challenge and would have spotted Almir\u00f3n falling, despite not being touched. The penalty box swan dive is now an endangered species. So that is something.",

      "body": "<p>When our nation\u2019s economic performance slumps, our politicians should dig deep to deliver real answers to the problems at hand and make a superhuman effort to bring everyone on side. But under our new prime minister the administration has mistaken posturing and trash talk for compromise and hard work.</p> \n<p>There appear to be two camps under Boris Johnson\u2019s command: those who definitely don\u2019t want a withdrawal deal with the European Union and are working to avoid one; and those who do but aren\u2019t working to secure one. Either way, the prospect of no deal looms larger than ever, at a time when we can least afford it.</p> \n<p>Last week official figures showed that for the first time in nearly seven years the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/09/uk-economy-contracts-on-back-of-brexit-uncertainty\" title=\"\">UK economy shrank</a>. Growth was nonexistent amid fears of a global slowdown and \u2026 you guessed it, continued Brexit uncertainty. Even our gravity-defying service sector slumped. So with 80 days left until we leave the EU, households and businesses across Britain need to hear a message of support that enhances their sense of community and \u201ccan do\u201d \u2013 not divisive language, uncompromising ultimatums and no-deal threats. I imagine the EU isn\u2019t terribly fond of those either.</p> \n<p>If facing a global economic slowdown, we must not make our own situation worse by pursuing the deliberately damaging uncertainty that comes with a no-deal departure. Further, I\u2019m told the team of in-house civil servants and policy wonks working on European issues at No 10 was disbanded when the new administration came in. Even if it is reformed with new people, several weeks will have been wasted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9d47b630-b555-4382-bd8a-a6364fd6687a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Boris Johnson's new backroom team in Downing Street is littered with ex-staff from Vote Leave, supports of controversial lobbying groups like the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, and those with links to Lynton Crosby and Mark Textor's&nbsp; C|T Group</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Dominic Cummings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Special advisor to the prime minister Boris Johnson and chief of staff in all but name, Cummings was campaign director of Vote Leave.

      "bodyText": "When our nation\u2019s economic performance slumps, our politicians should dig deep to deliver real answers to the problems at hand and make a superhuman effort to bring everyone on side. But under our new prime minister the administration has mistaken posturing and trash talk for compromise and hard work. There appear to be two camps under Boris Johnson\u2019s command: those who definitely don\u2019t want a withdrawal deal with the European Union and are working to avoid one; and those who do but aren\u2019t working to secure one. Either way, the prospect of no deal looms larger than ever, at a time when we can least afford it. Last week official figures showed that for the first time in nearly seven years the UK economy shrank. Growth was nonexistent amid fears of a global slowdown and \u2026 you guessed it, continued Brexit uncertainty. Even our gravity-defying service sector slumped. So with 80 days left until we leave the EU, households and businesses across Britain need to hear a message of support that enhances their sense of community and \u201ccan do\u201d \u2013 not divisive language, uncompromising ultimatums and no-deal threats. I imagine the EU isn\u2019t terribly fond of those either. If facing a global economic slowdown, we must not make our own situation worse by pursuing the deliberately damaging uncertainty that comes with a no-deal departure. Further, I\u2019m told the team of in-house civil servants and policy wonks working on European issues at No 10 was disbanded when the new administration came in. Even if it is reformed with new people, several weeks will have been wasted. The prime minister has made clear he thinks Brexit is a \u201cdo or die\u201d exercise \u2013 that we are coming out \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d. He says he wants to do so with a deal. Yet he hasn\u2019t said much about what he is actually doing to get one. Or what it would look like. I\u2019m also in no doubt that the aggressive language directed at the EU has only put the bloc off engaging in any meaningful way with this new government \u2013 reducing the chances of a different deal capable of winning approval in parliament. The prime minister\u2019s first speech to parliament was immediately dubbed \u201ccombative\u201d by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator. I know some will say tough talk shows real leadership \u2013 the country voted out, we must leave. They will say Theresa May failed to show much leadership, she compromised too much, she didn\u2019t really believe in the project in the first place. That\u2019s wrong. She did.

These events alone generate plenty of uncertainty, disruption and volatility \u2013 without the added spectacle of crashing out of the EU in October. No wonder No 10 issued a \u201cno holiday before Halloween\u201d edict to all staff last week. Thus far, Johnson\u2019s public statements suggest he\u2019s waiting for the EU to approach him with an offer to drop the backstop.

Black people make up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">15.6% of London\u2019s population</a>, while white people make up 59.8%. In 2018, 43% of searches were of black people, while 35.5% were of white people, according to official figures released last year from the London mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime.</p> <p>Johnson, as mayor of London, along with Kit Malthouse, his then deputy for policing, who is now the policing minister, vigorously promoted the intensive use of section 60 in parts of the capital from 2008 onwards as a means of tackling knife crime.</p> <p>Marian Fitzgerald, a former principal researcher in the Home Office research and statistics directorate and now visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said this did nothing to reduce knife crime and inflamed tensions between communities and the police.</p> <p>\u201cFar from reducing knife crime, the Johnson-Malthouse approach further entrenched a problem, which has become more intractable ever since,\u201d she said. \u201cIn doing so, they were also replicating the conditions which gave rise to the riots which erupted in Brixton in 1981 and rapidly spread to other parts of the country.</p> <p>\u201cAt their height in London, between 2008 and 2011, the proportion of section 60 searches which resulted in an arrest for carrying an offensive weapon of any sort was consistently less than 0.5%.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-12T15:58:09/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-12T15:58:09/embed.html\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Up to \u00a32.5bn has been promised by Johnson to create 10,000 additional prison places.</p> <p>But this is not a new initiative. A <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565014/cm-9350-prison-safety-and-reform-_web_.pdf\">prison safety and reform white paper</a> published in 2016 and the <a href=\"https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto\">Conservative party manifesto</a> for the 2017 snap election promised \u201cto modernise the prison estate, replacing the most dilapidated prisons and creating 10,000 modern prison places\u201d.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said the \u201cfirst new prison\u201d would be built at HMP Full Sutton \u2013 but Full Sutton has been earmarked for expansion since 2017. The ministry has been seeking permission to expand the capacity to more than 1,400, but the proposals have been met with significant objections in the local area.</p> <p>But even if the policy was new, it goes against the grain of evidence that suggests ex-home secretary Michael Howard\u2019s \u201cprisons works\u201d mantra is flawed.</p> <p>Peter Dawson, the director of the <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/\">Prison Reform Trust</a>, said: \u201cDoing away with overcrowded and outdated prisons makes a lot of sense. But governments have been promising that for decades, and they always underestimate what\u2019s involved.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to the prison service\u2019s own figures, it would take 9,000 new spaces just to eliminate overcrowding \u2013 not a single dilapidated prison could be taken out of use before that figure was reached.\u201d </p> <p>Not only will more prison places be created under Johnson\u2019s brand of justice, but prisoners could be locked up for longer too. Violent and sexual offenders will be the subject of a review of sentencing, as will the most prolific offenders. The general rule that a prisoner serving a fixed-term sentence is normally released automatically halfway through their sentence will be reviewed.</p> <p>But Johnson is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/boris-johnson-pledges-2-5bn-for-10-000-new-prison-beds-8d7nh0gmf\">set to trash the work of former justice secretary David Gauke</a>, who struck a refreshing tone in his approach to prison, welcomed across the criminal justice sector.</p> <p>Gauke, who was praised by experts as taking a balanced and evidence-based approach, advocated moving away from ineffective short-term sentences, as figures show about two-thirds of offenders on prison terms of less than 12 months reoffend, compared with a third of those given a court order.</p> <p>Christina Marriott, the chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/\">Revolving Doors Agency</a> charity, said: \u201cAny review of sentencing should take a good, hard look at short-sighted short prison sentences.\u201d She said a broad consensus among experts and practitioners was \u201cbolstered by the government\u2019s own data, which shows that short prison sentences drive up crime and make people less safe\u201d.</p> <p>The efficacy of Johnson\u2019s policies will continue to be vigorously debated. But there seems to be greater agreement that this wave of populist, headline-grabbing tough-on-crime policies are further evidence that Johnson is simply gearing up to fight a general election.</p> <p>Charlotte Pickles, director of the <a href=\"https://reform.uk/\">Reform thinktank</a>, said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s criminal justice reforms are a monumental waste of money. His proposed sentencing reforms ignore evidence that shows that longer prison sentences are ineffective at deterring crime or reducing reoffending.</p> <p>\u201cHis unequivocal embrace of stop and search is dumbfounding \u2013 research shows it does little to prevent violence. Intelligent investment is clearly needed, but these pledges are costly election baubles, not a serious attempt to make this country safer.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is \u201cjustice week\u201d in the new Boris Johnson government, where \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d is living up to the transatlantic comparison by laying down his vision for law and order in England and Wales. Johnson\u2019s hardline approach will put more police on the streets, increase use of stop and search, and incarcerate more offenders with longer sentences. \u201cI want criminals to be afraid, not the public,\u201d read the headline to his Mail on Sunday column. But so far the prime minister appears to be getting tough on crime without being so tough on \u2013 or interested in \u2013 its causes. Under Johnson\u2019s changes, more police officers, not just senior staff, will be able to authorise section 60 powers, which allow forces to designate specific areas where searches can take place without reasonable grounds of suspicion for a fixed period of time. This enlarged pool of officers will need a lower degree of certainty, so they must reasonably believe an incident involving serious violence \u201cmay\u201d rather than \u201cwill\u201d occur. The move unwinds one of the few more progressive moves made by his predecessor, Theresa May, who in 2014 restricted the use of section 60 as part of a broader package to limit the use of stop-and-search powers in the face of evidence that black people were far more likely to be stopped by the police than white people. This disproportionality continues. Black people make up 15.6% of London\u2019s population, while white people make up 59.8%. In 2018, 43% of searches were of black people, while 35.5% were of white people, according to official figures released last year from the London mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime. Johnson, as mayor of London, along with Kit Malthouse, his then deputy for policing, who is now the policing minister, vigorously promoted the intensive use of section 60 in parts of the capital from 2008 onwards as a means of tackling knife crime. Marian Fitzgerald, a former principal researcher in the Home Office research and statistics directorate and now visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said this did nothing to reduce knife crime and inflamed tensions between communities and the police. \u201cFar from reducing knife crime, the Johnson-Malthouse approach further entrenched a problem, which has become more intractable ever since,\u201d she said. \u201cIn doing so, they were also replicating the conditions which gave rise to the riots which erupted in Brixton in 1981 and rapidly spread to other parts of the country. \u201cAt their height in London, between 2008 and 2011, the proportion of section 60 searches which resulted in an arrest for carrying an offensive weapon of any sort was consistently less than 0.5%.\u201d Up to \u00a32.5bn has been promised by Johnson to create 10,000 additional prison places. But this is not a new initiative. A prison safety and reform white paper published in 2016 and the Conservative party manifesto for the 2017 snap election promised \u201cto modernise the prison estate, replacing the most dilapidated prisons and creating 10,000 modern prison places\u201d. The Ministry of Justice said the \u201cfirst new prison\u201d would be built at HMP Full Sutton \u2013 but Full Sutton has been earmarked for expansion since 2017. The ministry has been seeking permission to expand the capacity to more than 1,400, but the proposals have been met with significant objections in the local area. But even if the policy was new, it goes against the grain of evidence that suggests ex-home secretary Michael Howard\u2019s \u201cprisons works\u201d mantra is flawed. Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \u201cDoing away with overcrowded and outdated prisons makes a lot of sense. But governments have been promising that for decades, and they always underestimate what\u2019s involved. \u201cAccording to the prison service\u2019s own figures, it would take 9,000 new spaces just to eliminate overcrowding \u2013 not a single dilapidated prison could be taken out of use before that figure was reached.\u201d Not only will more prison places be created under Johnson\u2019s brand of justice, but prisoners could be locked up for longer too. Violent and sexual offenders will be the subject of a review of sentencing, as will the most prolific offenders. The general rule that a prisoner serving a fixed-term sentence is normally released automatically halfway through their sentence will be reviewed. But Johnson is reportedly set to trash the work of former justice secretary David Gauke, who struck a refreshing tone in his approach to prison, welcomed across the criminal justice sector. Gauke, who was praised by experts as taking a balanced and evidence-based approach, advocated moving away from ineffective short-term sentences, as figures show about two-thirds of offenders on prison terms of less than 12 months reoffend, compared with a third of those given a court order. Christina Marriott, the chief executive of the Revolving Doors Agency charity, said: \u201cAny review of sentencing should take a good, hard look at short-sighted short prison sentences.\u201d She said a broad consensus among experts and practitioners was \u201cbolstered by the government\u2019s own data, which shows that short prison sentences drive up crime and make people less safe\u201d. The efficacy of Johnson\u2019s policies will continue to be vigorously debated. But there seems to be greater agreement that this wave of populist, headline-grabbing tough-on-crime policies are further evidence that Johnson is simply gearing up to fight a general election. Charlotte Pickles, director of the Reform thinktank, said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s criminal justice reforms are a monumental waste of money. His proposed sentencing reforms ignore evidence that shows that longer prison sentences are ineffective at deterring crime or reducing reoffending. \u201cHis unequivocal embrace of stop and search is dumbfounding \u2013 research shows it does little to prevent violence. Intelligent investment is clearly needed, but these pledges are costly election baubles, not a serious attempt to make this country safer.\u201d",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian saw three people who had sustained injuries from pellet guns on Friday, but was unable to confirm the total number of people wounded.

      "bodyText": "Muslims in Indian-administered Kashmir spent the religious holiday of Eid al-Adha in a security lockdown, unable to call their friends and relatives as an unprecedented communications block remained in place for an eighth day. In Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s main city, Indian troops reportedly allowed some residents to walk to local mosques alone or in pairs, but areas of the city were almost entirely deserted on what is usually one of the biggest celebrations of the year. Blocks on landlines, mobile phones, the internet and cable TV, introduced last Monday, continued. Authorities said the restrictions were in place to avoid unrest. Last week 10,000 people reportedly took to the streets of Srinagar to protest against Delhi\u2019s decision to revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status. Government forces reportedly opened fire and used teargas. The Indian ministry of home affairs denied that any protests of more than 20 people took place \u2013 though TV footage appeared to show very large crowds chanting: \u201cGo back, go, India, go.\u201d The Guardian saw three people who had sustained injuries from pellet guns on Friday, but was unable to confirm the total number of people wounded. Hospitals have apparently been warned not to disclose patient numbers. \u201cOur hearts are on fire,\u201d said Habibullah Bhat, 75, who told Associated Press on Monday that he came to offer prayers despite his ill health. \u201cIndia has thrown us into the dark ages, but God is on our side and our resistance will win.\u201d A spokesperson for the Indian home affairs ministry said on Monday that prayers had gone ahead peacefully in local mosques in various parts of the state \u201cwithout any untoward incident\u201d. Kashmir police also said Eid festival prayers \u201cconcluded peacefully in various parts of the [Kashmir] valley\u201d. India\u2019s foreign ministry shared photographs of people visiting mosques but did not specify where the photographs were taken. The communication blackout means there is very little independent information about what is happening in Kashmir, where tens of thousands of reinforcement troops have flooded the streets. Cuts to phone and internet services have forced people to resort to passing paper notes to friends in order to contact relatives. It took three days for one note, sent by a woman working in Delhi, to be hand-delivered to her father in Kashmir. \u201cI am fine, do not worry about me. You take care of yourself,\u201d the note said. In an office complex in central Srinagar, scores of people queued for hours last week to use one of the few government phones that were made available to the public. Inside the small room where calls were taking place, a young girl could be heard telling her father, who was in Hyderabad: \u201cI don\u2019t want any gifts, just please come back.\u201d As her mother started to cry, so did others in the queue outside. A police officer told her to stop weeping, and said there were CCTV cameras operating. Kashmir\u2019s biggest newspaper, which was previously distributed to around 60,000 people, now prints a couple of thousand copies, and is only four pages long.

His assertion that the left is currently winning the argument on gun control is one for somebody with a steadier nervous system than mine to take on. The fallacy of a left and right binary where liberals compose the artistic elite and Trump\u2019s people compose the abandoned \u201cother\u201d of America, is never addressed in the piece.

What \u201cthe right\u201d might mean here is unclear and undefined, but let\u2019s suppose it to mean Fox News, the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d of Breitbart et al and the president. On the contrary, it is the very cancellation of this film that plays to rightwing dogma. Standing up for artists\u2019 liberty of expression, at a time when the president attacks journalists, creatives and minorities, would clearly be a pointed rejoinder to Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric. Furthermore, the concept of satire itself seems to be in need of a little boost at the minute, at a time when the concept of \u201cfake news\u201d, as piggybacked on by the president, makes <a href=\"https://medium.com/foreword/dont-confuse-fake-news-with-op-eds-satire-and-journalistic-errors-e372e9fa889\">a dangerous amalgamation</a> of disinformation on one hand and op-eds, satire and journalistic errors on the other.</p> <p>Cancelling The Hunt is reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/14/how-bojack-horseman-became-the-most-empathetic-show-on-television\">BoJack Horseman</a> episode <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_and_Prayers_(BoJack_Horseman)\">Thoughts and Prayers</a>, in which a studio is struggling to put out a violent murder-fest<em>, </em>at a time when there are shootings in the US every five minutes.

      "bodyText": "In Lucy Mangan\u2019s review (8 August) of the Channel 4 documentary Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain there is no mention of the of the word \u201cexploitation\u201d. While it may be obvious to some, it would have been useful to address the exploitation of Jade Goody directly. This programme demonstrates, yet again, how people connected with her exploited her for their own gain, be it to make money, further their careers, raise their profile or get enjoyment through ridicule. Big Brother, a quasi-study of human behaviour, was in fact an exploitation of the weak or disillusioned through the selection of candidates who could be manipulated to expose their vulnerabilities, dreams, fears and prejudices for our \u201cenjoyment\u201d and Channel 4\u2019s profit margin. Most of those connected with the programme happily used this exploitation for their gain, while claiming it was an expos\u00e9 of \u201creal\u201d people\u2019s lives and great entertainment. While presenter Davina McCall\u2019s tears showed her recognition of this fact, it never distracted her, or her fellow commentators, from ramping up mob hysteria. By producing this documentary, Channel 4 shows that nothing has changed, and it is once again exploiting Jade.

      "bodyText": "The internment of 27,000 \u201cenemy aliens\u201d, principally German, Austrian and Italian, occurred mostly at the height of the fifth column scare that followed the fall of France (Hodge recalls harrowing tale of how grandfather was interned by British, 9 August). Most were refugees, around two-thirds of them Jewish, but they also included German, Austrian and Italian nationals who were resident in Britain. When reviewing government papers while researching our book on the subject, we found no evidence that the policy was driven by antisemitism. The predominant fear was that this group might contain spies or saboteurs; and when one internment camp officer discovered that most of his charges were Jewish, he exclaimed: \u201cDammit \u2013 I knew we\u2019d got the wrong lot.\u201d The British government soon began vetting the internees and releases started within three months; 10,000 had been freed by the end of 1940, although a further 6,000 had been deported to Canada and Australia, where many of them decided to stay. Your report cites Churchill as giving the order \u201cCollar the lot!\u201d to start the arrests. It is not clear whether he said this or whether it was attributed to him as a paraphrase. However, we did adopt the phrase as the title of our book, first published in 1980. Peter and Leni Gillman London",

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>.

The normally frozen region, which is a crucial part of the planet\u2019s cooling system, is spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and worsening the manmade climate disruption that created the tinderbox conditions. A spate of huge fires in northern Russia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada discharged 50 megatonnes of CO2 in June and 79 megatonnes in July, far exceeding the previous record for the Arctic. The intensity of the blazes continues with 25 megatonnes in the first 11 days of August \u2013 extending the duration beyond even the most persistent fires in the 17-year dataset of Europe\u2019s satellite monitoring system.

      "bodyText": "Five years ago, Janet Comenos worked for a mobile phone branding startup. Between sales calls, she developed \u201ca nervous tic\u201d: forever refreshing Perez Hilton\u2019s celebrity website for snippets of Hollywood gossip. According to a Vulture article, Comenos then put together a squad of researchers in India to do the same thing: comb the trashiest ends of the web for iffy tweets, racial slurs and ill-advised sexts sent by about 27,000 prominent figures. These are then fed to a team of data specialists in Boston who crunch the numbers, based on 224 factors, and generate a \u201crisk score\u201d out of 100 for each person to gauge how close they are to getting permanently cancelled (shamed, rejected or boycotted for offensive behaviour or language). Comenos\u2019s company is called SpottedRisk: a \u201cdisgrace insurer\u201d backed by Lloyd\u2019s of London and touting for business from studios and brands badly burned by a celebrity shooting themselves in the foot \u2013 and damaging whatever project they were involved in. These losses have been substantial. Tiger Woods\u2019 2009 car crash, plus revelations about his infidelities, cost him $22m in brand contracts \u2013 and the shareholders of those brands up to $12bn. Meanwhile,#MeToo has escalated Hollywood blacklisting. After sexual abuse allegations against Kevin Spacey in 2017, Ridley Scott reshot the thriller All the Money in the World with Christopher Plummer in Spacey\u2019s role \u2013 at a cost of $10m. Another Spacey movie, The Billionaire\u2019s Boys Club, ploughed on with its planned release regardless of increasing public disgust at its star. It made \u00a398 on its opening night. SpottedRisk says its payout for Spacey would be about $8m \u2013 a number generated by combining his risk score with its \u201coutcry index\u201d to gauge public reaction. Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein would merit $10m payouts, while Roseanne Barr is relatively small change at $6m. Is anyone uninsurable? SpottedRisk\u2019s \u201cdoctors of disgrace\u201d reckon there are two people they would turn down: the musician R Kelly, up for multiple sex crimes \u2013 and Donald Trump, who \u201cwould probably trigger a claim every week,\u201d says SpottedRisk\u2019s behavioural scientist Pete Dearborn. \u201cSome people are basically human triggers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 August 2019. An earlier version misnamed Lloyd\u2019s of London as \u201cLloyds of London\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019d hate to be thought of as a Nimby. How ghastly. But everyone has their line in the sand. Mine is a literal one, each summer, as blacked-up morris dancers enjoy my local beaches.</p> <p>\u201cBroadstairs is a bit like a Cornish fishing village perched on the side of Kent,\u201d says Jo Tuffs, director of the town\u2019s <a href=\"https://broadstairsfolkweek.org.uk/\" title=\"\">folk week</a>, which began on Friday. By the end of the week, around 60,000 people will have passed through Broadstairs \u2013 population 25,000 \u2013 to enjoy the 54-year-old festival. Sixty acts, 50 events a day, 15,000 tickets. All this will generate an estimated \u00a32.5m for the town.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those in favour of the dancers' face-painting say they are dressing up as chimney sweeps or miners</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If it\u2019s your first visit, some of the acts may surprise you. There are 35 troupes of <a href=\"https://broadstairsfolkweek.org.uk/whats-on/dancing/\" title=\"\">morris dancers attending</a>, for example, and five of these perform in blackface. These are typically morris dancers from the \u201cborder morris\u201d tradition \u2013 a style which came from the counties lining the English-Welsh border: Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The origins of their use of blackface is a key argument in the clash between folk festival organisers and the critics who want to run the tradition out of town \u2013 as happened in 2016 when the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-37172500\" title=\"\">Shrewsbury folk festival banned such dancers</a>.</p> <p>Those in favour say the face-painting has nothing to do with racism, the Black and White Minstrels or the lampooning of anyone of black and minority ethnic backgrounds. It is \u201chistory\u201d or a \u201cbit of fun\u201d, they claim. They argue that the practice dates back centuries to well before the time morris dancers might have encountered blacked-up performers from overseas. They are dressing up as chimney sweeps or miners, a ploy that originated with agricultural workers trying to disguise themselves from their employers when they went out to sing and dance for a few extra pennies, when begging was illegal. It has nothing to do with race, they say. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, defended the practice in 2017, when he was communities secretary, saying he was \u201cproud\u201d of a group in Alvechurch in his Bromsgrove constituency. \u201cThey are as racist as I am,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sajidjavid/status/818562872364175360\" title=\"\">he tweeted</a>.</p> <p>But former Green councillor and parliamentary candidate Ian Driver has been campaigning for years against the way Broadstairs folk week supports blacked-up morris dancers. He calls the festival <a href=\"https://iandriverthanet.blogspot.com/2019/08/last-dance-for-racist-broadstairs-folk.html\" title=\"\">\u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d</a> and says the organisers are all white and the acts are 90% white even though there is African-Caribbean, Hispanic and Eastern European folk music which would better represent the local area.</p> <p>Driver is convinced, based on evidence from a number of folk-dance scholars, that the practice was influenced and inspired by American minstrel shows from the Victorian era and their homegrown spin-offs. With the advent of the railways and music halls, styles of dancing, shows and skits spread easily across the ocean and from town to town. The race equality thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/blog/morris-dancers-blackface\" title=\"\">the Runnymede Trust</a>, has said that \u201csupporters of the English folk tradition claim that blackfacing has nothing to do with race but their protestations certainly need to be contrasted with historical evidence and not reported as if this were undisputed fact\u201d.</p> <p>History is interesting. Origin stories fascinate people. All of these arguments are well-worn. But the more I listen to how critics and supporters slice, dice and muddle the evidence, the more tempted I am to say to hell with all of it. What relevance has origin in what is perceived as outwardly \u2013 often proudly \u2013 racist behaviour? </p> <p>As a university lecturer, I used to teach a cultural studies class on race and identity to journalism students. It was a racially diverse group and included three or four undergraduates who educated me over our time together.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019d hate to be thought of as a Nimby. How ghastly. But everyone has their line in the sand. Mine is a literal one, each summer, as blacked-up morris dancers enjoy my local beaches. \u201cBroadstairs is a bit like a Cornish fishing village perched on the side of Kent,\u201d says Jo Tuffs, director of the town\u2019s folk week, which began on Friday. By the end of the week, around 60,000 people will have passed through Broadstairs \u2013 population 25,000 \u2013 to enjoy the 54-year-old festival. Sixty acts, 50 events a day, 15,000 tickets. All this will generate an estimated \u00a32.5m for the town. If it\u2019s your first visit, some of the acts may surprise you. There are 35 troupes of morris dancers attending, for example, and five of these perform in blackface. These are typically morris dancers from the \u201cborder morris\u201d tradition \u2013 a style which came from the counties lining the English-Welsh border: Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The origins of their use of blackface is a key argument in the clash between folk festival organisers and the critics who want to run the tradition out of town \u2013 as happened in 2016 when the Shrewsbury folk festival banned such dancers. Those in favour say the face-painting has nothing to do with racism, the Black and White Minstrels or the lampooning of anyone of black and minority ethnic backgrounds. It is \u201chistory\u201d or a \u201cbit of fun\u201d, they claim. They argue that the practice dates back centuries to well before the time morris dancers might have encountered blacked-up performers from overseas. They are dressing up as chimney sweeps or miners, a ploy that originated with agricultural workers trying to disguise themselves from their employers when they went out to sing and dance for a few extra pennies, when begging was illegal. It has nothing to do with race, they say. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, defended the practice in 2017, when he was communities secretary, saying he was \u201cproud\u201d of a group in Alvechurch in his Bromsgrove constituency. \u201cThey are as racist as I am,\u201d he tweeted. But former Green councillor and parliamentary candidate Ian Driver has been campaigning for years against the way Broadstairs folk week supports blacked-up morris dancers. He calls the festival \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d and says the organisers are all white and the acts are 90% white even though there is African-Caribbean, Hispanic and Eastern European folk music which would better represent the local area. Driver is convinced, based on evidence from a number of folk-dance scholars, that the practice was influenced and inspired by American minstrel shows from the Victorian era and their homegrown spin-offs. With the advent of the railways and music halls, styles of dancing, shows and skits spread easily across the ocean and from town to town. The race equality thinktank, the Runnymede Trust, has said that \u201csupporters of the English folk tradition claim that blackfacing has nothing to do with race but their protestations certainly need to be contrasted with historical evidence and not reported as if this were undisputed fact\u201d. History is interesting. Origin stories fascinate people. All of these arguments are well-worn. But the more I listen to how critics and supporters slice, dice and muddle the evidence, the more tempted I am to say to hell with all of it. What relevance has origin in what is perceived as outwardly \u2013 often proudly \u2013 racist behaviour? As a university lecturer, I used to teach a cultural studies class on race and identity to journalism students. It was a racially diverse group and included three or four undergraduates who educated me over our time together. I felt guilty watching the scales fall from my students\u2019 eyes as we studied a number of current instances of blackface. They\u2019d experienced racism. They were ready to debate whether white people wearing dreadlocks is a form of blacking up. They hadn\u2019t necessarily thought deeply about how outdated modes of behaviour are still supported and validated in 21st-century Britain. Blacking up has got all sorts of people into all sorts of trouble in recent times: Prada, Gucci, Vogue, Kylie Jenner, Ariana Grande. Just last week Belgium\u2019s Africa Museum held a party, for which it has since apologised, where guests wore colonial costumes, and some painted their faces black too. There\u2019s an easy solution. I don\u2019t think the folk week organisers need to further examine whether performers\u2019 use of blackface is or isn\u2019t racist. They could simply move the festival\u2019s identity on by banning the practice. \u2022 Sophie Morris is a journalist and university lecturer.

I Think The Answer\u2019s Yes and it could be someone from Rotterdam or anywhere, as long as it means we don\u2019t have to bring back Karius, which would require watching matches From Under The Covers\u201d \u2013 Tim Woods. \u201cRe: Fifa 19 commentary \u2013 sadly I didn\u2019t mishear this Alan Smith gem, though not a day goes by where I wish I had: \u2018Well that\u2019s why they call him fishy, because he loves the chips!\u2019 Just why would you say that out loud for other people to hear? Where does one even start trying to unpack a sentence like that?\u201d \u2013 Stephen Dickinson. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day prize is \u2026 Stephen Dickinson, who gets a copy of 50 Years of Shoot! We have more to give away, so get scribbling. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Get your ears around Football Weekly, right here! NEWS, BITS AND BOBS With Liverpool netminder and US sitcom housewife Alisson Becker suffering from calf-knack, Adri\u00e1n! Adri\u00e1n! has gone from West Ham exile to showpiece starter in Wednesday\u2019s European Super Pot final against crisis club Chelsea. And with other Reds goalies also in the sick bay, Andy Lonergan, taken for a busman\u2019s holiday this summer, may be due another go at the John Burridge role. Paul Pogba says \u201ca question mark remains\u201d over his Manchester United future. \u201cI give the maximum each time I am on a green pitch,\u201d he pleaded, having set up two goals for Ole\u2019s army on Sunday. The transfer window for Premier League clubs may have SLAMMED SHUT but future targets are being set. In a preemptive move, Athletic Bilbao have tied down the striker Inaki Williams to a NINE-year contract and a \u20ac135m buyout clause. Allowing for exchange rates and dithering, Williams will thus cost Ed Woodward around \u00a3200m in January. Paul Scholes reckons that Class of 92 plaything, Salford City, are aiming for the very top as they welcome Nasty Leeds to the Peninsula Stadium in the Fizzy Cup. \u201cI know it\u2019s a long way off, but the target has to be getting to the Premier League at some point,\u201d he blathered. And all bets are off for the Ballon d\u2019Or after Romelu Lukaku scored four goals in his first run out for Inter against Serie D giants Virtus Bergamo. STILL WANT MORE? They\u2019re back and they\u2019re bigger and better than the same as ever: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s Premier League action. \u201cWhen I got married I bought a flat next to the training ground.\u201d Athletic Bilbao manager and old romantic, Gaizka Garitano, gets his chat on with Will Unwin. Hungry Wolves can beat down the door to the top six but Big Vase may hold them back, writes big bad wolf Barry Glendenning. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive snobbery if you play the ball long.\u201d Wimbledon boss Wally Downes chews the fat with Ben Fisher. Manchester City were dead good at West Ham, reveals Jacob Steinberg. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s cameo appearance was almost more significant for Arsenal than the workaday win over Newcastle, writes floating football brain in a jar Jonathan Wilson. Premier League pictures. Twelve of them. Right here! \u201cGirls see me on TV and know it\u2019s possible\u201d: Super Cup referee St\u00e9phanie Frappart gets her chat on with Paul Doyle. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO! KEEP \u2018GUYS\u2019 OUT OF FOOTBALL!",

Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, said ministers were likely to take over running Ferguson Marine Engineering from its owner later this week following a long dispute about cost overruns on two passenger ferries.

The construction is ingenious - you might say gimmicky, but I like that kind of thing: the title story, for example, consists of the essays written by the students on how their favourite mythical creature might solve some world problem (though a lot of the problems chosen, inevitably, are on a more personal scale).

It\u2019s a fast-paced story of three Pakistani young people (one of them British-Pakistani), negotiating their culture, religion etc. One of them is gay and struggling to accept it, another is from a very privileged background, another is from a slum of Karachi. I can\u2019t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn\u2019t too sure about the ending. Still, very good.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3324324\">RedmonT </a>has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel\u2019s relationship makes me feel. It\u2019s awful \u2013 the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It\u2019s been a long time since a book made me feel that way.</p> <p>He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn\u2019t even matter that it\u2019s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew). There have been two or three moments that made me sit up and exclaim \u201cFUCK\u201d or \u201cOH MY GOD\u201d.</p> <p>I think he does something in/with his books that no other living writer does.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17591667\">MarisadeAzevedoMonte </a>recommends Joseph Heller\u2019s Something Happened:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Catch-22 attracts all the plaudits but this is well worth checking out as a study of the office environment and the feeling of \u2018Is this all there is?\u2019 It\u2019s as sharp as TV\u2019s Mad Men, which I suspect was influenced by it. I read about one third of the book in a single evening until the early hours.

I can\u2019t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn\u2019t too sure about the ending. Still, very good. RedmonT has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen: Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel\u2019s relationship makes me feel. It\u2019s awful \u2013 the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It\u2019s been a long time since a book made me feel that way. He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn\u2019t even matter that it\u2019s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew). There have been two or three moments that made me sit up and exclaim \u201cFUCK\u201d or \u201cOH MY GOD\u201d. I think he does something in/with his books that no other living writer does. Finally, MarisadeAzevedoMonte recommends Joseph Heller\u2019s Something Happened: Catch-22 attracts all the plaudits but this is well worth checking out as a study of the office environment and the feeling of \u2018Is this all there is?\u2019 It\u2019s as sharp as TV\u2019s Mad Men, which I suspect was influenced by it. I read about one third of the book in a single evening until the early hours. It\u2019s that good. It is that good. Interesting links about books and reading Toni Morrison\u2019s essays and criticism in the New York Times. \u201cPour another gallon into the bucket of our national grief, David Berman is gone.\u201d A moving tribute to the great man. This American Life\u2019s Ira Glass on narrative storytelling. The novel F Scott Fitzgerald never wrote. \u201cEven though the letters were from David Foster Wallace, Susan says that the letters as physical objects didn\u2019t seem particularly special at the beginning.\u201d They seem pretty special now. 200 years of Herman Melville. It is not reassuring to know that a Supreme Court judge was a Shakespeare conspiracy theorist. (Hat tip to Swelter.)

      "body": "<p>What does Phoebe Robinson want to see when she arrives at the Edinburgh fringe? \u201cJust tons of dudes smuggling their bangers and mash in their kilts.\u201d Observational comic, astute social critic, signee of a deal with ABC studios, bestselling author (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufx8zQHUM5E\">You Can\u2019t Touch My Hair</a> &amp; Other Things I Still Have to Explain) and one half of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/23/2-dope-queens-brooklyn-pair-reign-supreme\">2 Dope Queens</a> (the podcast duo turned HBO stars), Robinson has a philosophy: that comedy \u2013 thirsty, uninhibited, occasionally gross, with riffs on Googling David Bowie\u2019s penis size after learning he has died \u2013 can be a force for good.</p> <p>At Edinburgh, Robinson will tour her show, called Sorry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/trump-delays-putting-harriet-tubman-on-20-bill-outrage\">Harriet Tubman</a>, which covers \u201cgender stuff and race stuff but also talking about mishaps in the bedroom during sex, just like lower-brow things. So I think that it\u2019ll be sort of a culmination of where I\u2019m at in my life right now.\u201d It argues, like most of her work, that if we can be honest about our profoundly flawed selves and our profoundly flawed society, maybe we can make our world a little less screwed up. Or at least tell a couple of decent fart jokes along the way.</p> <p>The title, she says, comes from a running joke she and her fellow dope queen \u2013 The Daily Show\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/26/jessica-williams-james-netflix-daily-show-interview\">Jessica Williams</a> \u2013 used to make on the podcast, about how disappointed Tubman would be, \u201cbecause, you know, she basically led slaves to freedom on the underground railroad and I\u2019m like I just wanna smash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/01/michael-b-jordan-black-panther-creed-ii-hollywood\">Michael B Jordan</a>,\u201d Robinson says.</p> <p>I ask her how she has disappointed Tubman this week.

      "bodyText": "What does Phoebe Robinson want to see when she arrives at the Edinburgh fringe? \u201cJust tons of dudes smuggling their bangers and mash in their kilts.\u201d Observational comic, astute social critic, signee of a deal with ABC studios, bestselling author (You Can\u2019t Touch My Hair &amp; Other Things I Still Have to Explain) and one half of 2 Dope Queens (the podcast duo turned HBO stars), Robinson has a philosophy: that comedy \u2013 thirsty, uninhibited, occasionally gross, with riffs on Googling David Bowie\u2019s penis size after learning he has died \u2013 can be a force for good. At Edinburgh, Robinson will tour her show, called Sorry, Harriet Tubman, which covers \u201cgender stuff and race stuff but also talking about mishaps in the bedroom during sex, just like lower-brow things. So I think that it\u2019ll be sort of a culmination of where I\u2019m at in my life right now.\u201d It argues, like most of her work, that if we can be honest about our profoundly flawed selves and our profoundly flawed society, maybe we can make our world a little less screwed up. Or at least tell a couple of decent fart jokes along the way. The title, she says, comes from a running joke she and her fellow dope queen \u2013 The Daily Show\u2019s Jessica Williams \u2013 used to make on the podcast, about how disappointed Tubman would be, \u201cbecause, you know, she basically led slaves to freedom on the underground railroad and I\u2019m like I just wanna smash Michael B Jordan,\u201d Robinson says. I ask her how she has disappointed Tubman this week. It\u2019s only Tuesday, she objects. But then she remembers how, that day or the day before, she and her boyfriend had been working out at the gym in her building, and that while practising a curtsy lunge, an extremely elegant move, she \u201cjust let out like the loudest, wettest fart\u201d. Her boyfriend has his earphones in, but he still heard it. \u201cSo I thought that was a definite let-down for Harriet,\u201d she says. Robinson likes to imagine Tubman, her noble face flecked with a single, perfect Demi-Moore-in-Ghost tear, hearing that fart too, and wondering if learning to navigate by the North Star had really been worth it. The comic, who describes herself as an off-brand Oprah, grew up in America\u2019s midwest, watching the sitcoms Moesha and Martin, and the sketch show In Living Color. She was a sarcastic kid, but not one who could necessarily crack a joke. Comedy was never her endgame. But in college, she joined an improv troupe, and after college, while working as an executive assistant, a friend convinced her to take a standup class and she fell in love, performing wherever she could, from pubs to biker bars.

The French equality minister, Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, confirmed that she is \u201c<em>sapiosexuelle</em>\u201d in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/french-minister-marlene-schiappa-mocked-for-saying-brainy-men-turn-her-on-jzfw8n782\" title=\"\">an interview</a>.</p> <p><strong>How did the subject </strong><strong>come up? </strong>She was being asked about a novel she had written, in which the heroine finds the former French prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 unbelievably sexy.</p> <p><strong>This is nonsense, surely. </strong>No. The term was apparently coined in 1998, \u201csapiens\u201d being the Latin word for \u201cwise\u201d.</p> <p><strong>I knew that. </strong>Sapiosexuals are sexually aroused by intellectual debate, deep thinking and long conversations about literature.</p> <p><strong>No they aren\u2019t. </strong>Don\u2019t knock it just because you\u2019ve never experienced it.</p> <p><strong>Are you calling me stupid?</strong> Never mind \u2026 you have lovely eyes.</p> <p><strong>Is anyone seriously suggesting that this qualifies as a</strong><strong> sexual orientation?</strong> Well, it\u2019s as much an identity as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2019/mar/04/age-of-the-autosexual-the-people-sexually-attracted-to-themselves\" title=\"\">autosexuality</a>.</p> <p><strong>It sounds like a pretentious excuse for having an ugly boyfriend with no sense of humour. </strong>The term has attracted some criticism in the past from people who say it reinforces simplistic and outmoded definitions of intelligence, and that it discriminates against neurodiversity.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s more or less what I was saying. </strong>But the term has definitely caught on in recent years. About 0.5% of users on the dating website OkCupid identify as sapiosexual.</p> <p><strong>I suppose this emphasis on the mind over outward appearance is refreshing, but I\u2019m still suspicious. </strong>Because you think the distinction says more about the person claiming it than the people they\u2019re attracted to?</p> <p><strong>No, it\u2019s just that, clever as I am, I would rather that someone loved me for my cheekbones. </strong>Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure the right shallow idiot will come along one day.</p> <p><strong>Fingers crossed. </strong>Anyway, you probably don\u2019t need to be a sapiosexual in order to love a sapiosexual.</p> <p><strong>Maybe not. </strong><strong>Are they taller than me?</strong> I\u2019ll check and let you know.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cYou should message me if you like 19th-century novels, quantum mechanics, opera and politics. And have never seen Love Island, like I never have.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cWhat\u2019s the word for being sexually attracted to people with lots of money?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: Sapiosexuals. Age: Mid 30s. Appearance: not important. Why not important? Because it\u2019s all about what\u2019s on the inside. What\u2019s on the inside? Brains, baby. I don\u2019t get it. Am I missing something? I\u2019ll keep it simple for you: we sapiosexuals are sexually attracted to highly intelligent people, regardless of looks. What do you mean \u201cwe\u201d? There are lots of us. The French equality minister, Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, confirmed that she is \u201csapiosexuelle\u201d in an interview. How did the subject come up? She was being asked about a novel she had written, in which the heroine finds the former French prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 unbelievably sexy. This is nonsense, surely. No. The term was apparently coined in 1998, \u201csapiens\u201d being the Latin word for \u201cwise\u201d. I knew that. Sapiosexuals are sexually aroused by intellectual debate, deep thinking and long conversations about literature. No they aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t knock it just because you\u2019ve never experienced it. Are you calling me stupid? Never mind \u2026 you have lovely eyes. Is anyone seriously suggesting that this qualifies as a sexual orientation? Well, it\u2019s as much an identity as autosexuality. It sounds like a pretentious excuse for having an ugly boyfriend with no sense of humour. The term has attracted some criticism in the past from people who say it reinforces simplistic and outmoded definitions of intelligence, and that it discriminates against neurodiversity. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s more or less what I was saying. But the term has definitely caught on in recent years. About 0.5% of users on the dating website OkCupid identify as sapiosexual. I suppose this emphasis on the mind over outward appearance is refreshing, but I\u2019m still suspicious. Because you think the distinction says more about the person claiming it than the people they\u2019re attracted to? No, it\u2019s just that, clever as I am, I would rather that someone loved me for my cheekbones. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure the right shallow idiot will come along one day. Fingers crossed. Anyway, you probably don\u2019t need to be a sapiosexual in order to love a sapiosexual. Maybe not. Are they taller than me? I\u2019ll check and let you know. Do say: \u201cYou should message me if you like 19th-century novels, quantum mechanics, opera and politics. And have never seen Love Island, like I never have.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWhat\u2019s the word for being sexually attracted to people with lots of money?\u201d",

Goldsmiths, University of London, is also attempting to phase out single-use plastics and installing more panels to power its buildings in New Cross, as part of a move to become carbon neutral by 2025. Beef products will no longer be available in the institution\u2019s cafes and shops when the academic year begins in September, while an additional 10p levy will be added to the sale of bottled water and disposable plastic cups to discourage their use. Prof Frances Corner, who took up the post of Goldsmiths\u2019 warden this month, said the college would also switch to a completely clean energy supplier when its current contract ends and look into how all students could take curriculum options related to the climate crisis. A psychology undergraduate, Isabelle Gosse, 20, said she thought the move was \u201ca really good start to being more environmentally friendly\u201d. She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s a really positive move \u2013 Goldsmiths is recognising its own power and accountability in being more environmentally conscious. \u201cBanning the sale of beef meat on campus, phasing out single-use plastics and the other pledges that the new warden has made highlights the current climate emergency that the world is facing.\u201d Scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet found that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce humans\u2019 environmental impact. Previous research had revealed that the environmental impact of beef dwarfs that of other meat including chicken and pork. Corner said: \u201cThough I have only just arrived at Goldsmiths, it is immediately obvious that our staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that they are determined to help deliver the step change we need to cut our carbon footprint drastically and as quickly as possible.\u201d From 1 December, Goldsmiths\u2019 endowment fund will also cease to hold investments in companies that generate more than 10% of their revenue from fossil fuel extraction.

Last year, the University of Sheffield opened a zero waste shop \u2013 selling everything from unpackaged spices and herbs to laundry detergent. The university, which has also reduced its carbon emissions by 31% since 2005, completely divested from fossil fuel companies in February.

Data obtained from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) under a freedom of information request showed that out of all adult prisoners released in 2016, 67% of those who slept rough or were otherwise homeless went on to commit another crime within a year. For those living in \u201cunsettled\u201d or temporary accommodation, the rate of reoffending was also higher, at 54%, compared with 43% for those who had either a permanent home or short-term supported housing.

The accommodation status of a further 24,967 ex-prisoners \u2013 of whom 51% reoffended within a year \u2013 was not known. This category is likely to be contentious and is thought to also mean sleeping rough or otherwise homeless. Last August, concerns were raised over the number of ex-offenders likely to be sleeping rough after MoJ figures revealed that more than 100,000 prisoners left detention for unsettled or unknown accommodation over the previous three years. For people who were released from prison into bail accommodation, probation accommodation or accommodation provided by the Home Office Immigration Enforcement Service \u2013 totalling 1,972 \u2013 the reoffending rate was 43%. The Homelessness Reduction Act, which came into force in October 2018, puts an obligation on prison and probation services to refer prison leavers to local authorities if they are at risk of homelessness. However, charities have pointed out that this is often just a transfer of information rather than a resolution \u2013 with many single homeless people deemed \u201cintentionally\u201d homeless because they had been in prison. Lindsay Ryder, director of housing and wellbeing at Nacro, said urgent government investment was needed to ensure plans were in place before prisoners left custody. \u201cWe cannot afford for them to be held back by homelessness, a lack of essential medication or health support, a lack of ID or access to sufficient money, as these are essential basics required for people to successfully reintegrate back into our local communities,\u201d she added. A spokesperson for the MoJ said: \u201cThe first step to reducing reoffending is making sure everyone leaving prison has access to secure and stable accommodation. \u201cThat is why we are spending an extra \u00a322m a year helping offenders stay off the streets, and have placed a new duty on governors to alert councils if someone leaving their prison is at risk of homelessness. \u201cWe\u2019re also helping vulnerable former prisoners find stable accommodation through a \u00a36m pilot scheme at Leeds, Pentonville and Bristol prisons.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On International Women\u2019s Day in 1971, 4,000 women, men and children marched through central London, demanding equal rights and equal pay for women. As a director and producer, Sue Crockford, who has died aged 76, led a team capturing the event: <a href=\"http://www.the-lcva.co.uk/videos/594bba5c1c423d243c1b14a7\" title=\"\">A Woman\u2019s Place</a> (1971) became the first British film about the women\u2019s liberation movement.</p> <p>Her documentary, which also covered the first national conference, at Ruskin College, Oxford, the previous year, provides an invaluable historical record.</p> <p>It examined the movement\u2019s demands, but also addressed stereotypes about feminists as humourless or uninterested in parenting, giving much attention to the conference creche (run by fathers) and the gaiety of the marchers, showing women dressed up for a satirical beauty pageant or singing the 1930s song Keep Young and Beautiful as they walked, accompanied by a gramophone of the period.</p> <p>A Woman\u2019s Place was Sue\u2019s first film and, she later explained, \u201cmade me realise why I wanted to make films. I wanted to see whether other people could be engaged by what I believed in\u201d. An interview with her about the making of the film is <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/in-the-beginning-we-demanded\" title=\"\">archived</a> in the British Library\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/sisterhood\" title=\"\">Sisterhood and After</a> oral history collection. She went on to produce nearly 50 documentaries and short films, was a campaigner and community activist, and helped shape Channel 4\u2019s disability and children\u2019s programming.</p> <p>Sue grew up in Coulsdon, Surrey, the daughter of Patricia (nee Mead) and Herbert Crockford, who worked for the land registry. Time spent with her father exploring open spaces led to her later interest in gardens and woodlands.

      "bodyText": "On International Women\u2019s Day in 1971, 4,000 women, men and children marched through central London, demanding equal rights and equal pay for women. As a director and producer, Sue Crockford, who has died aged 76, led a team capturing the event: A Woman\u2019s Place (1971) became the first British film about the women\u2019s liberation movement. Her documentary, which also covered the first national conference, at Ruskin College, Oxford, the previous year, provides an invaluable historical record. It examined the movement\u2019s demands, but also addressed stereotypes about feminists as humourless or uninterested in parenting, giving much attention to the conference creche (run by fathers) and the gaiety of the marchers, showing women dressed up for a satirical beauty pageant or singing the 1930s song Keep Young and Beautiful as they walked, accompanied by a gramophone of the period. A Woman\u2019s Place was Sue\u2019s first film and, she later explained, \u201cmade me realise why I wanted to make films. I wanted to see whether other people could be engaged by what I believed in\u201d. An interview with her about the making of the film is archived in the British Library\u2019s Sisterhood and After oral history collection. She went on to produce nearly 50 documentaries and short films, was a campaigner and community activist, and helped shape Channel 4\u2019s disability and children\u2019s programming. Sue grew up in Coulsdon, Surrey, the daughter of Patricia (nee Mead) and Herbert Crockford, who worked for the land registry. Time spent with her father exploring open spaces led to her later interest in gardens and woodlands. After attending the local girls\u2019 grammar school, she studied English and fine art at Leeds University, also writing on contemporary film as part of her degree. Her interest in theatre-making and political activism found expression in the late 60s through the London-based Angry Arts collective, which used cultural events and agitprop for political campaigns, including against the Vietnam war. Any public space could serve the antiwar cause; she remembered \u201cwar scenes\u201d enacted for the benefit of horrified cinema queues. In 1968 Sue helped create the \u201cconsciousness-raising\u201d Tufnell Park Women\u2019s Liberation Group. Articulate on camera, she was a regular media contributor on the women\u2019s movement, and then with Liberation Films made A Woman\u2019s Place. Children and young people then became a focus of her professional life.

She co-founded the first gay teenage group there and led students on expeditions to the National Gallery, parks and even \u2013 although the trip was billed rather differently to the local authority \u2013 a commune in Scotland. Sue was unshockable and never patronising: implacable in her determination that the arts belong to everyone. Other early work included setting up two hostels for homeless girls and, with other local parents, the experimental community nursery at Dartmouth Park, north London, about which she made the film One, Two, Three (1975), with her long-time collaborator Margaret Dickinson. As she moved further into film-making she continued to explore topics in north London: Somerstown (1984), for Thames Television, was a social history combining contemporary interviews with 20s footage; while King\u2019s Cross: David and Goliath (1992), for Channel 4, focused on opposition to redevelopment. In 1985 Sue became an assistant commissioning editor in education for Channel 4, under Naomi Sargent. Over three years she developed Just 4 Fun, a half-hour slot each weekday for pre-school children, and also gave a platform to international animation. The open and creative atmosphere at the channel suited her perfectly.

It was a landslide.\u2019\u201d Trump also played golf with many celebrities, none of whom had a good word to say about him. When Samuel L Jackson was asked if he or Trump was the better golfer, he replied: \u201cOh, I am, for sure. I don\u2019t cheat.\u201d Alice Cooper appeared to back this up during an interview when he said: \u201cThe worst celebrity golf cheat? I wish I could tell you that. It would be a shocker. I played golf with Donald Trump one time. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d However, only Oscar de la Hoya is on record as detailing exactly how Trump cheats at golf. In 2016, he recounted a game to reporters. \u201cFirst ball, [Trump] hits off to the water, gets another ball from his pocket. Hits it off to the left, out of bounds. Another one to the water. Then the fourth ball he hits \u2013 I know it went to the bushes. But Donald, what he does, he tees off first so he can take off right away. I pipe mine down the middle. So we go off to our ball, and who do we see? Donald Trump, right in the middle of the fairway.\u201d Let\u2019s end with some rapid-fire anecdotes from celebrities who turned down Trump\u2019s romantic advances. Salma Hayek: \u201cHe got my number and he would call me to invite me out. When I told him I wouldn\u2019t go out with him even if I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, he called \u2013 well, he wouldn\u2019t say he called, but someone told the National Enquirer \u2013 that he wouldn\u2019t go out with me because I was too short.\u201d Brooke Shields: \u201cI was on location during a movie, and he called me right after he had gotten a divorce \u2026 and said: \u2018I really think we should date, because you\u2019re America\u2019s sweetheart and I\u2019m America\u2019s richest man, and the people would love it.\u2019\u201d Emma Thompson: \u201cHe said: \u2018I want to offer you accommodations in one of my beautiful establishments and maybe we could have dinner sometime. And I thought, \u2018You\u2019re ringing my trailer to offer me accommodations and dinner?! You\u2019re weird!\u2019 I just said: \u2018Well that\u2019s very kind of you. I\u2019ll ring you later.\u2019 And I just put the phone down and told everyone. It was a source of great amusement.\u201d Finally, special mention should go to Candice Bergen, who is responsible for perhaps the most revealing story of all. She went on a blind date with Trump in the 1970s and revealed that \u201che was wearing a three-piece burgundy suit and burgundy patent leather loafers in a burgundy limousine\u201d. Money can buy you anything, so long as it\u2019s a horrible colour.",

However he faced a mountain of evidence including testimony from alleged victims and documents obtained by prosecutors indicating an elaborate trafficking ring.</p> <p>Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the southern district of New York overseeing the prosecution against Epstein, said over the weekend that the investigation would continue \u2013 and hinted at the possibility of prosecution of Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b02662782ddb3b7d79189888afa324ab47be737\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b02662782ddb3b7d79189888afa324ab47be737/0_0_654_523/500.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Maxwell poses at the back of his yacht Lady Ghislaine.\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Maxwell poses at the back of his yacht Lady Ghislaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2013 which included a conspiracy count \u2013 remains ongoing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A number of Epstein\u2019s accusers have frequently identified Maxwell as playing a central role in arranging the abuse of his victims. The most recent accusations were contained in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/ghislaine-maxwell-lawsuit-files-jeffrey-epstein\">more than 2,000 pages of court documents</a> unsealed last week in connection to a civil case that one of Epstein\u2019s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, filed against Maxwell back in 2015.</p> <p>Giuffre has previously accused Maxwell of recruiting her to work as Epstein\u2019s masseuse at age 15, when the teenager was a locker-room attendant at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida. When Maxwell accused her of being a liar, Giuffre brought the defamation suit, which was settled shortly before trial in 2017.</p> <p>In documents unsealed on Friday, just a few hours before Epstein was found dead in his cell, Giuffre\u2019s lawyers accused Maxwell of \u201cacting as a madam\u201d for the financier, alleging that \u201cmultiple witnesses\u201d had testified that Maxwell was responsible for \u201crecruiting, maintaining, harbouring and trafficking girls for Epstein\u201d. Maxwell has never been criminally charged, and has always denied wrongdoing. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers have not been responding to requests for comment.</p> <p>Maxwell was the youngest of the nine children of Betty and Robert Maxwell, the latter the owner of the Mirror Group, with Ghislaine rumoured to be his favourite child. The media tycoon and former Labour MP named his \u00a315m ($18.6m) yacht Lady Ghislaine, and put his daughter in charge of his football club, Oxford United.</p> <p>When Robert Maxwell acquired the New York Daily News, he reportedly sent Ghislaine to warm up Manhattan society for his arrival.</p> <p>Following her father\u2019s death in 1991 \u2013 after apparently falling overboard from Lady Ghislaine near the Canary Islands \u2013 Ghislaine Maxwell flew to New York onboard a Concorde. She left behind a huge uproar over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/aug/26/money2\">$460m </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/aug/26/money2\"> found to be missing from her father\u2019s companies\u2019 pensions funds</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"598a4933b571235676e2f4a0e59da5a4e08825fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/598a4933b571235676e2f4a0e59da5a4e08825fe/122_175_1342_1262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ghislaine Maxwell in New York in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"940\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ghislaine Maxwell in New York in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billy Farrell Agency / Rex Featu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her family\u2019s wealth, status and influence considerably depleted, Maxwell found something of a replacement in her relationship with Epstein, whom she reportedly met in the early 1990s after breaking up with Count Gianfranco Cicogna, a member of a wealthy Italian family.</p> <p>Epstein was a former maths teacher turned investment banker and financier to \u2013 among others \u2013 the billionaire chairman of Victoria\u2019s Secret, Leslie Wexner. Although Maxwell\u2019s relationship with Epstein was initially romantic, it evolved into something more akin to that of a close friend, confidante and personal assistant.</p> <p>Epstein bought her a $5m Manhattan townhouse, and she regularly accompanied him on his private jet on trips across the world \u2013 and was also a fixture at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. She soon became a well-connected transatlantic socialite, pictured with everyone from Donald Trump to Prince Andrew, whom she reportedly introduced to Epstein.</p> <p>However according to Giuffre, now 35, and other women who claim they were abused by Epstein when they were underage in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Maxwell\u2019s responsibilities included finding and grooming girls to provide the financier \u2013 and his wealthy friends \u2013 with massages and sexual acts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e3e5e2f6f3501befb629560ffe172a54ce3f016\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e3e5e2f6f3501befb629560ffe172a54ce3f016/305_104_1809_2370/763.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Epstein in New York in 2005.\" width=\"763\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Epstein in New York in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giuffre has alleged that one of the figures she was coerced into sexual encounters with was Prince Andrew. Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the claims, saying \u201cany suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue\u201d.</p> <p>Maxwell initially appeared to weather the accusations against her associate, following a much-criticised plea deal in 2008, in which Epstein pleaded guilty to a single count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida state law but escaped federal charges. He served only 13 months of an 18 month jail sentence.</p> <p>Despite the prosecution of her former boyfriend and associate, Maxwell initially maintained a lively public profile; she founded a charity, the TerraMar Project, dedicated to preserving the oceans, giving a Ted Talk on the subject and even speaking at the United Nations. In 2010, Maxwell was<a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-madam.html\"> a guest at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding</a>.</p> <p>However as the allegations against Epstein continue to mount, Maxwell withdrew from the public eye and distanced herself from the financier. Her Manhattan townhouse, once a notorious party haunt, has been sold, although she retains addresses in London and Salisbury. She has reportedly not been seen at either for weeks. Citing people familiar with the Epstein investigation, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/epsteins-accusers-call-her-his-protector-and-procurer-is-ghislaine-maxwell-now-prosecutors-target/2019/08/11/7af5968a-bbbd-11e9-a091-6a96e67d9cce_story.html\">the Washington Post reported</a> authorities \u201chave had trouble locating\u201d her.</p>",

However he faced a mountain of evidence including testimony from alleged victims and documents obtained by prosecutors indicating an elaborate trafficking ring. Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the southern district of New York overseeing the prosecution against Epstein, said over the weekend that the investigation would continue \u2013 and hinted at the possibility of prosecution of Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators. \u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2013 which included a conspiracy count \u2013 remains ongoing,\u201d he said. A number of Epstein\u2019s accusers have frequently identified Maxwell as playing a central role in arranging the abuse of his victims. The most recent accusations were contained in more than 2,000 pages of court documents unsealed last week in connection to a civil case that one of Epstein\u2019s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, filed against Maxwell back in 2015. Giuffre has previously accused Maxwell of recruiting her to work as Epstein\u2019s masseuse at age 15, when the teenager was a locker-room attendant at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida. When Maxwell accused her of being a liar, Giuffre brought the defamation suit, which was settled shortly before trial in 2017. In documents unsealed on Friday, just a few hours before Epstein was found dead in his cell, Giuffre\u2019s lawyers accused Maxwell of \u201cacting as a madam\u201d for the financier, alleging that \u201cmultiple witnesses\u201d had testified that Maxwell was responsible for \u201crecruiting, maintaining, harbouring and trafficking girls for Epstein\u201d. Maxwell has never been criminally charged, and has always denied wrongdoing. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers have not been responding to requests for comment. Maxwell was the youngest of the nine children of Betty and Robert Maxwell, the latter the owner of the Mirror Group, with Ghislaine rumoured to be his favourite child. The media tycoon and former Labour MP named his \u00a315m ($18.6m) yacht Lady Ghislaine, and put his daughter in charge of his football club, Oxford United. When Robert Maxwell acquired the New York Daily News, he reportedly sent Ghislaine to warm up Manhattan society for his arrival. Following her father\u2019s death in 1991 \u2013 after apparently falling overboard from Lady Ghislaine near the Canary Islands \u2013 Ghislaine Maxwell flew to New York onboard a Concorde. She left behind a huge uproar over $460m found to be missing from her father\u2019s companies\u2019 pensions funds. Her family\u2019s wealth, status and influence considerably depleted, Maxwell found something of a replacement in her relationship with Epstein, whom she reportedly met in the early 1990s after breaking up with Count Gianfranco Cicogna, a member of a wealthy Italian family. Epstein was a former maths teacher turned investment banker and financier to \u2013 among others \u2013 the billionaire chairman of Victoria\u2019s Secret, Leslie Wexner. Although Maxwell\u2019s relationship with Epstein was initially romantic, it evolved into something more akin to that of a close friend, confidante and personal assistant. Epstein bought her a $5m Manhattan townhouse, and she regularly accompanied him on his private jet on trips across the world \u2013 and was also a fixture at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. She soon became a well-connected transatlantic socialite, pictured with everyone from Donald Trump to Prince Andrew, whom she reportedly introduced to Epstein. However according to Giuffre, now 35, and other women who claim they were abused by Epstein when they were underage in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Maxwell\u2019s responsibilities included finding and grooming girls to provide the financier \u2013 and his wealthy friends \u2013 with massages and sexual acts. Giuffre has alleged that one of the figures she was coerced into sexual encounters with was Prince Andrew. Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the claims, saying \u201cany suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue\u201d. Maxwell initially appeared to weather the accusations against her associate, following a much-criticised plea deal in 2008, in which Epstein pleaded guilty to a single count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida state law but escaped federal charges. He served only 13 months of an 18 month jail sentence. Despite the prosecution of her former boyfriend and associate, Maxwell initially maintained a lively public profile; she founded a charity, the TerraMar Project, dedicated to preserving the oceans, giving a Ted Talk on the subject and even speaking at the United Nations. In 2010, Maxwell was a guest at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding. However as the allegations against Epstein continue to mount, Maxwell withdrew from the public eye and distanced herself from the financier. Her Manhattan townhouse, once a notorious party haunt, has been sold, although she retains addresses in London and Salisbury. She has reportedly not been seen at either for weeks. Citing people familiar with the Epstein investigation, the Washington Post reported authorities \u201chave had trouble locating\u201d her.",

      "bodyText": "Global stocks are sliding again, spooked by fears that the prolonged trade war between the US and China could push the world economy into recession. This has sparked a rush into the safety of assets such as the Japanese yen, gold and US government bonds. Dow Jones down 0.81% at 26,074 S&amp;P 500 down 0.63% at 2,899 Nasdaq down 0.64% at 7,908 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.33% at 7,229 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.13% at 11,678 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.36% at 5,311 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.17% at 20,290 Goldman Sachs said over the weekend that fears of the US-China trade war leading to a recession were increasing, and reiterated that it no longer expected a trade deal between the world\u2019s two biggest economies before the 2020 US presidential election. It cut its fourth-quarter US growth forecast to 1.8% due to the trade war. The pound has recovered after hitting a 10-year low against the euro overnight. It is up 0.46% at $1.2091 and 0.33% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.0779. Thank you for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Argentina\u2019s peso has slumped 25% and the country\u2019s bonds fell in London trading after voters rejected president Mauricio Macri\u2019s austere economic policies in primary elections, casting doubt on his chances of re-election in October, Reuters reports. Opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez - whose running mate is former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner - won by a wider-than-expected 15.5 percentage points with 47.65% of votes, with 99% of ballots counted after Sunday\u2019s primary. Fernandez\u2019s lead far exceeded the margin of 2-8% forecast in recent opinion polls. Argentina is in recession with inflation at over 55% after three and a half years of Macri\u2019s policies. Investors nonetheless see the Fernandez/Kirchner duo as a riskier prospect than free-markets advocate Macri. Kirchner imposed strict currency controls that slammed investment during her 2007-2015 administration. She feuded with the country\u2019s key farm sector over export taxes and presided over a multi-year standoff with bondholders that kept Argentina locked out of the international capital markets. Argentina\u2019s 2028-maturing, euro-denominated bond was down almost 9 cents in European trading on Monday, Tradeweb data showed. The peso had plunged 6.1% to 49 per U.S. dollar early Monday on the platform of digital brokerage firm Balanz, which operates the currency online non-stop. Wall Street has opened lower, as expected. Dow Jones down 174 points, or 0.66%, at 26,112 in early trading S&amp;P 500 down 15 points, or 0.54%, at 2,902 Nasdaq down 49 points, or 0.62%, at 7,910 In London, the FTSE 100 index is 0.3% lower at 7,231. The City regulator has begun \u201cwide-ranging enquiries\u201d following the US hedge fund Muddy Waters\u2019 attack on the UK-listed Burford Capital last week that sent its shares plummeting by 65% in 24 hours, writes Patrick Collinson, the Guardian\u2019s Money editor. In what is fast becoming one of the most extraordinary financial battles in recent years, Muddy Waters \u2013 a so-called short seller, which makes money when share prices fall \u2013 made a string of accounting and poor management allegations against Burford, a business that specialises in providing funding for lawsuits. Burford hit back on Monday with a detailed analysis of what it said was \u201cevidence consistent with illegal market manipulation\u201d and said it had informed both regulators and \u201ccriminal prosecutors\u201d. It added that it had been a victim of sophisticated selling techniques, called \u201cspoofing\u201d and \u201clayering\u201d, to artificially drive down its share price. In other corporate news, Mike Ashley\u2019s future son-in-law, Michael Murray, who has been tasked with sprucing up Sports Direct\u2019s leisurewear emporia, says it will take four years to transform the brand into the Selfridges of sportswear. Mike Bird, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Hong Kong-based reporter, is reporting from the airport, which remains closed. All flights have been cancelled for Monday. Meanwhile, in Australia.... US stocks are expected to slide when the opening bell rings on Wall Street at 2.30pm BST. Stock futures suggest the Dow Jones will open 144 points lower, or 0.55%, while the S&amp;P 500 is set to fall 16 points, or 0.56%, and the Nasdaq is seen losing 47 points, or 0.62%. Markets continue to be haunted by fears over the impact of the prolonged US-China trade war on the world economy, and there has been a rush into the safety of gold, the Japanese yen and US government bonds. British households are more worried about losing their jobs than at any time in the past five and a half years, according to official figures released today, in a sign of the pressure on workers across the country, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Despite unemployment falling to the lowest point since the mid 1970s, the Office for National Statistics said that people\u2019s expectations for rising joblessness in the year ahead have been climbing. According to consumer confidence surveys used by the government statistics agency to compile a dashboard of economic wellbeing, expectations of rising unemployment have hit the highest level since June 2013. The findings come as Brexit looms and the risks of recession mount. Faced with the threat of a disorderly no-deal departure at the end of October and a global economic slowdown, the UK economy contracted in the three months to June for the first time since 2012, putting the country on the brink of recession. Two consecutive quarters of contraction are regarded by economists as a recession. Hong Kong stocks are likely to fall when the market opens, stock futures suggest. The airport is closed as anti-government protests in the former British colony entered their tenth week. The UK government is concerned about the latest violence in Hong Kong and urged the city\u2019s government to engage with all parties in constructive dialogue, according to a spokesman for prime minister Boris Johnson. The luxury fashion label Versace apologised to China yesterday after one of its T-shirts was criticised for identifying the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau as countries. The T-shirts caused outrage on social media sites in China, and the fashion house, which was acquired by Michael Kors last year, said the shirts had been removed from sale and destroyed. It stated on Weibo: It\u2019s our company\u2019s negligence and we express deep apology for the impact it caused. Versace reiterates that we love China and resolutely respect China\u2019s territory and sovereignty. The yen has also surged, as the rush to safety continues. The Japanese currency is at its highest level in more than 1 1/2 years against the dollar, up 0.55% at 105.08 yen. The pound has staged a recovery after hitting a 10-year low against the euro overnight, of \u20ac1.0724 (disregarding the flash crash in October 2016). It is currently 0.37% higher against the dollar at $1.2084, and 0.46% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.0794. Sterling fell earlier after a warning from a UK think tank, the Institute for Government, that a no-deal Brexit is looking increasingly likely on 31 October, given the lack of time to secure a new agreement with the EU and the diminishing number of ways in which MPs could block such a process. Oil prices are declining as markets assume a global economic slowdown will lead to weaker demand: Brent crude is down 1.04% at $57.92 a barrel. The International Energy Agency lowered its oil demand forecasts on Friday after sluggish demand in the first five months of 2019, the smallest increase in that period since 2008. It warned that the global slowdown and an escalation of the US-China trade war \u201ccould lead to reduced trade activity and less oil demand growth\u201d. Gold, a safe-have asset, is holding above $1,500 an ounce: Spot gold has gained 0.56% to $1,506 an ounce. European stock markets have reversed earlier gains and are now in the red, as traders fret about the state of the world economy and trade wars. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 36 points, or 0.5%, at 7,217 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.01% at 11,694 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.25% at 5,314 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.21% at 20,282 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.5% at 8,713 Wall Street is also expected to open lower. Global trade disruption is a symptom of a deeper malaise, writes Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz and a former deputy director at the IMF, in the Guardian. It is only a matter of time until the escalating tensions between China and the US prompt many more economists to warn of an impending global economic recession coupled with financial instability. On 5 August, Bloomberg News said that the yield curve, a closely watched market metric, \u201cBlares Loudest US Recession Warning Since 2007\u201d. And Larry Summers, a former US treasury secretary who was also closely involved in crisis-management efforts in 2008-09, recently tweeted: \u201cWe may well be at the most dangerous financial moment \u2026 since 2009.\u201d European shares have gone into the red. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 16 points, or 0.23%, at 7,237 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.03% at 11,690 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.34% at 5,309 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.05% at 20,314 Gold prices have risen again this morning, beyond $1,500 an ounce (it went through this level last Wednesday for the first time since April 2013). Spot gold is up 0.6% at $1,505 an ounce. Gold is seen as a safe-haven investment in times of turmoil. Markets remain nervous, as traders worry about a global economic slowdown and the trade war between the US and China. Shares across Europe have gone into decline after opening higher this morning. Oil prices are also continuing their decline. Brent crude is 0.84% lower at $58.04 a barrel. Here is our full story on Thomas Cook. Sterling has recovered, after hitting a ten-year low against the euro overnight, pressured by recession and Brexit fears. Official data showed on Friday that the economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019, stoking fears that the UK could be heading for its first recession in a decade. (A recession is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of economic contraction.) The pound is now trading 0.5% higher against the euro at 92.60p, after plunging to 93.26p against the single currency late on Sunday, the lowest it has been since October 2009, disregarding the flash crash in October 2016. It also fell to a 31-month low of $1.2015 against the dollar. Sterling is now 0.27% higher versus the dollar at $1.2071. Here is a round-up of this morning\u2019s other news. There are now three FTSE 350 companies left with no women on its board, after the Swiss-headquartered mining company Ferrexpo appointed Fiona MacAulay as an independent director and chair of its remuneration committee. She is a chartered geologist with more than 30 years\u2019 experience in the oil and gas sector, and chairs Independent Oil &amp; Gas. Shares in Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel company, plunged as much as 20% and are now down nearly 16% at 8.18p. The troubled firm confirmed it is looking to raise another \u00a3150m from investors, on top of the \u00a3750m it has already asked for, to stave off a cash crunch by Christmas. The woes on the British high street continue: there was a big decline in the number of people visiting shops in July and the number of empty shops hit a four-year high. The latest figures from the British Retail Consortium and Springboard show the national town centre vacancy rate rose to 10.3% in July, the highest since January 2015. Footfall declined by 1.9%, the worst fall for July since 2012. Britons have spent \u00a34bn stockpiling goods as fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen, new research suggests. One in five people are hoarding food, drinks and medicine, spending an extra \u00a3380 each, according to a survey by the finance provider Premium Credit. Shares in Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier, fell 4.85% in Hong Kong today after the company bowed to pressure from China and sacked two airport staff for alleged misconduct. It also suspended a pilot on 30 July who is accused of taking part in the Hong Kong protests. The company reiterated that it had to comply with a new directive from Beijing banning all staff who support the protests from working on flights to the mainland or through its airspace. China\u2019s aviation regulator has ordered the airline to hand over identifying information for staff on mainland-bound flights effective immediately. Cathay\u2019s chief executive Rupert Hogg sent another message to staff today, after emailing them on Saturday. We are all obliged to abide by law at all times. Cathay Pacific Group has a zero tolerance approach to illegal activities. Specifically, in the current context, there will be disciplinary consequences for employees who support or participate in illegal protests. These consequences could be serious and may include termination of employment. He called on staff not to \u201csupport or participate\u201d in today\u2019s protests at the airport. The Hong Kong airport authority has cancelled all flights not yet checked in for today, as anti-government protesters demonstrated peacefully at the airport for a fourth day. Protests in the city have entered a tenth week, and have descended into violence across the city as police fired teargas at protesters and beat them with batons. European stock markets are enjoying a bit of respite, after two weeks of losses. The Chinese central bank fixed the Chinese yuan above the seven-to-one-dollar mark for the third trading day in a row, but the latest fixing was stronger than traders expected. The yuan weakened through that level for the first time since May 2008 a week ago, prompting US president Donald Trump to label China a currency manipulator \u2013 an accusation that was firmly rejected by Beijing. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: While the direction of travel is clear and that the yuan is likely to weaken further, it would appear that as long as the decline happens gradually, markets are more likely to be comfortable with it. The FTSE 100 in London has turned negative, however, trading down 3 points, or 0.05%, at 7,250. It had opened 0.5% higher. On the continent, shares are still pushing higher. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.34% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.38% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.18% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.06% Here is our story on Aramco. My colleage Jasper Jolly writes: Aramco will broadcast a briefing on its results for the first time ever on Monday afternoon, at 2pm BST, as it increasingly looks to engage with international investors. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (or MbS), has made diversifying Aramco away from a dependence on oil production a key part of his plan for the next decade in the nation\u2019s economy. Aramco offered a rare glimpse into its finances in April when it sold $12bn of bonds to investors. Today\u2019s half-yearly earnings report lifts the lid on the Saudi state-owned company\u2019s latest financial performance, and will be followed by its first-ever investor call at 2pm BST. The move comes as Saudi Arabia wants to list 5% of the company which would raise $100bn, at the target valuation of $2tn, within the next two years. This would dwarf Alibab\u2019s $25bn IPO in September 2014, which was the biggest-ever float on Wall Street. The gulf state\u2019s standing in the international investment community was dealt a blow last year after an outcry over the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents. But Aramco\u2019s $12bn bond sale in April attracted record demand from investors. Aramco, officially called the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of oil. It produced 10m barrels of crude oil a day between January and June, far above its American rival ExxonMobil, which pumped 3.9m a day. The company has also taken a 20% stake in the oil refinery and chemicals business of India\u2019s Reliance Industries. Mukesh Ambani, the Reliance chairman and managing director who is also Asia\u2019s richest man, announced the deal at the Indian company\u2019s annual meeting in Mumbai today. As part of the deal, Aramco will supply 500,000 barrels a day of crude oil to Reliance\u2019s twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat. It is India\u2019s biggest foreign investment to date. It\u2019s a better start to the week for European shares, after last week\u2019s turbulence \u2013 caused by Donald Trump\u2019s attack on alleged \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d by China. Things settled down later in the week. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 38 points, or 0.5%, at 7,291 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.9% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.9% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.6% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.47% Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, markets and economics in the UK and the Eurozone. Saudi Arabia\u2019s secretive state-owned oil company has made a $47bn profit for the first half, cementing its position as the world\u2019s most profitable company. Saudi Aramco will host its first-ever earnings call with investors and analysts today (a webcast at 2pm BST) \u2013 as it works towards a $2tn stock market flotation, planned within the next couple of years. Saudi Arabia recently revealed that the float is back on, after putting it on hold several months ago. The IPO is a key part of Saudi plans for an economic transformation by privatising part of its vast oil wealth and opening the kingdom to international investment, and lessening its reliance on oil. Saudi Aramco\u2019s profit of $46.9bn in the six months to 30 June is down from $53bn a year earlier, however, due to lower oil prices. You can read the results here. Last year, Aramco racked up profits of $111.1bn to overtake Apple, dwarfing every other corporation in the world. Apple, the world\u2019s largest listed company, made $59.5bn (excluding one-off items) in 2018 while ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, made $20.8bn. Brent crude, the global benchmark, dipped 0.4% to $58.30 a barrel this morning while US crude lost 0.4% to $54.3 a barrel. Saudi Aramco\u2019s president &amp; chief executive Amin H. Nasser said: Despite lower oil prices during the first half of 2019, we continued to deliver solid earnings and strong free cash flow underpinned by our consistent operational performance, cost management and fiscal discipline. Disclosing our financial results for the first time, as part of our $12bn debut international bond issuance, marked a significant milestone in Saudi Aramco\u2019s history. Asian stock markets are mixed, with worries over the US-China trade war lingering. Japan, Singapore and India are closed for holidays. On Friday, comments from Donald Trump that Washington was continuing trade talks with China but would not make a deal for now drove a late sell-off on Wall Street. European shares are expected to open higher, with stock futures suggesting 0.6% gains for the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index and Germany\u2019s Dax. Sterling is flat against the dollar and the euro, at $1.2041 and \u20ac1.0748. It\u2019s August, and the economic calendar is very light.",

It was either my leg or my life at that point.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I took my leg off, I\u2019d say I didn\u2019t play for maybe about 12 months, because I had to get used to my amputation and I had to get fit and healthy \u2013 I was pounded with chemotherapy for about a year.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They have explored collapsing the government and setting up an alternative, temporary \u201cunity government\u201d to request an extension to article 50, but Labour has made clear it would not support a centrist candidate, such as Ken Clarke or Yvette Cooper, to be temporary PM.</p> \n<p>Senior Conservative MPs on the rebel side also stressed to the Guardian that this was a \u201cvery nuclear option\u201d that would only be tried as a last resort, given the risk this approach could backfire and lead to an election after a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/12/labour-exploring-rapid-no-confidence-vote-in-pm-in-early-september-no-deal-brexit\">Labour exploring rapid September no-confidence vote in Boris Johnson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If a no-confidence vote passed, MPs would first have 14 days to form an alternative government, but if unsuccessful, an election would be triggered.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street believes rebel MPs will try to make a move to stop a no-deal Brexit in the second week of September, with the EU unlikely to respond until after that battle has played out. A senior government source said the date for a parliamentary battle was expected to be 9 September \u2013 a week after MPs return from their summer break. Boris Johnson may meet key EU leaders, such as Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, but not Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, before the G7 summit in Biarritz, France at the end of August. However, No 10 is not expecting any breakthrough until the EU has seen what happens in the first weeks of September, when an alliance of Tory and opposition MPs try to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. The EU is adamant that the backstop is not up for renegotiation but the senior government source said there is still hope in Downing Street that a deal is possible if it becomes clear that parliament could not prevent no deal on 31 October. Labour has been mulling an immediate confidence vote in Johnson\u2019s government in the first week of September but will only go ahead if there are enough Conservative MPs willing to bring down their own prime minister. Rebel Tory MPs, led by Dominic Grieve and Philip Hammond, are working behind the scenes over the summer to stop a no-deal Brexit. They have explored collapsing the government and setting up an alternative, temporary \u201cunity government\u201d to request an extension to article 50, but Labour has made clear it would not support a centrist candidate, such as Ken Clarke or Yvette Cooper, to be temporary PM. Senior Conservative MPs on the rebel side also stressed to the Guardian that this was a \u201cvery nuclear option\u201d that would only be tried as a last resort, given the risk this approach could backfire and lead to an election after a no-deal Brexit. If a no-confidence vote passed, MPs would first have 14 days to form an alternative government, but if unsuccessful, an election would be triggered. In this event, Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, has threatened to press ahead with Brexit on 31 October with or without a deal and schedule the election for the days after that date, with parliament shut down.

The large number of independent MPs whose support is not clear and the possibility of some pro-Brexit Labour MPs abstaining add to the uncertainty. Instead, leading Conservatives in the \u201cno to no deal\u201d campaign are prioritising legislative routes. Downing Street expects 9 September to be the first opportunity for a legislative battle, as the government is bound by law to provide a report on Northern Ireland on 4 September and to then debate it in parliament for five days. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson remained \u201cvery clear in his determination to want to get a deal\u201d. He said: \u201cHe believes a deal is in the UK\u2019s and the EU\u2019s best interests and he has said he will be energetic in pursuit of a deal. \u201cWe very much want a deal but we\u2019re also clear about what needs to be achieved in order to secure that.\u201d The spokesman added: \u201cHe has held a number of conversations with EU leaders, so has the prime minister\u2019s sherpa David Frost. We are also making very detailed preparations at home to ensure the UK is ready to leave the EU in all circumstances on 31 October. \u201cThere are daily meetings taking place to ensure that we are ready and there are bi-weekly strategy meetings taking place in relation to the negotiations if the EU is willing to sit down and negotiate.\u201d Earlier, Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, acknowledged he had previously argued that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be chaos. He said: \u201cThe choice that faces us now is either disorder in terms of Brexit or an orderly, sensible approach and that\u2019s why I\u2019m really pleased the structure of cabinet committees, the way in which government is bearing down upon the issues, shows a sense of urgency and purpose that is absolutely essential if we\u2019re to avoid the sort of disorder I\u2019ve talked about \u2013 and I\u2019m increasingly confident we can achieve that. \u201c[The prime minister] wants to achieve a deal but if we cannot achieve a deal then it needs to be as orderly a Brexit as possible \u2013 that is why the work of government at the moment is focused hugely on that effort.\u201d Buckland added that \u201cthere is a difference between crashing out and not achieving a deal\u201d, and said ongoing work would \u201cavoid the chaos of a crash-out\u201d.",

While eyebrows have been raised at the England coach scheduling his announcement quite so far ahead of the 8 September deadline, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been champing at the bit for this tournament for quite some time. </p> \n  <p>Back in November 2017 Jones said his backroom team were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/04/eddie-jones-england-players-world-cup-fitness\">already up to a 10th draft of their World Cup plan</a>, while he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/02/eddie-jones-england-world-cup-japan\">on top of travel logistics</a>, helped immeasurably by his experience working in Japan. Last May he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/12/eddie-jones-heat-england-world-cup-game-changers\">turned up the heat and humidity</a> at their Bagshot base, and since then every training camp and squad selection has been made while eyeing up the big kick-off against Tonga in Sapporo on 22 September.<br></p> \n  <p>So who will make his final 31? As Jones said before the Wales match: \u201cEvery day is selection day. We talk to players every day, seeing how they act, how they respond, how much they want to play for England, how they want to be part of a team, how they can develop from being a good club player to an international one. The match against Wales is just one of a number of selection days; no one is going to be selected or not on one match.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Last Friday Robert Kitson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/09/eddie-jones-england-world-cup-big-picture\">picked a possible 31</a>, a sinfully difficult task while Jones openly admitted he was still weighing up his midfield, full-back and scrum-half options. </p> \n  <p>Full-back Mike Brown and centre Ben Te\u2019o were dropped from the experimental squad that warmed up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/11/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-warmup-match-report\">so effectively against Wales</a>, which would lessen the shock of their exclusion. Other questions remain, of course. Joe Marler gave the coach sufficient notice of his U-turn on availability \u2026 right? </p> \n  <p>Gloucester scrum-half Willi Heinz, meanwhile, has suddenly risen to help take the tally of players capped by Jones since 2016 to an eye-watering 70. Lewis Ludlam impressed too, while Joe Marchant and Jack Singleton now also have caps that would add substance to their selection. </p> \n  <p>Injuries, as always, may play a part \u2013 Ruaridh McConnochie was widely backed to be on standby for Jack Nowell \u2026 until the Bath flyer suffered injury of his own. Henry Slade and Sam Underhill could be nervous too \u2013 their setbacks may be minor, but the weekend before a squad unveiling is not the best time to be on the sidelines.</p> \n  <p>Stand by your beds, folks. Announcement and reaction incoming (due 1pm BST). Let the wild speculation begin.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EnglandRugby/status/1160861818392326144\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who'll be going to Japan? \u2708<br><br>Find out at 13:00 BST today when we\u2019ll be announcing Eddie Jones\u2019 31-man England squad \ud83c\udf39 <a href=\"https://t.co/w6dKLlZ7Ye\">pic.twitter.com/w6dKLlZ7Ye</a></p>\u2014 England Rugby (@EnglandRugby) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EnglandRugby/status/1160861818392326144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-12T11:00:16.106Z\">at 12.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

Below the line, kent bray offers \u2026 That is a strong squad. Injury free, they will be very very hard to beat.

Youngs had better stay fit. Te\u2019o very unlucky imo. I understand Francis is a more attacking option than Te\u2019o, therefore balances the squad a bit better, I just don\u2019t think Francis is international class. A very good squad though. As I said, if they remain injury free, England fans should look forward to the tournament with excitement and confidence. Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson, speaking to BBC Five Live, talked up Lewis Ludlam\u2019s credentials \u2026 The glimpse that I have had \u2026 you just feel that he looks like an international player. He looks like he sits nicely. Early on, he was tapping the rest of the team on the heads \u2013 senior pros \u2013 saying: \u2018Let\u2019s do this\u2019. He slots in nicely. The balance of that back row, either with Tom Curry or if he steps into 7 with Courtney Lawes or Billy Vunipola \u2013 no-one wants to come up against those guys. Jones is due to explain his selections later, but meanwhile he now knows his core of 31 for the final three warm-up matches against Wales, Ireland and Italy. He said of the final three tune-up outings: \u201cEvery game is an opportunity to improve our game fitness, our team cohesion, and our tactical adaptability. Each game for us will have a specific purpose.\u201d In case you missed it, Gerard Meagher spoke to Ruaridh McConnochie for this lovely piece earlier in the month. He has a stranger route to Japan than most, having been part of England\u2019s sevens set-up until extremely recently \u2026 Owen Farrell and Dylan Hartley are still, theoretically, co-captains of England. However, in the absence of Hartley, who hasn\u2019t played since last December due to a niggling knee injury, it\u2019s turned sharply towards being a one-man job. The second paragraph of England\u2019s announcement reads simply: \u201cOwen Farrell will captain England in his second Rugby World Cup.\u201d Jones\u2019s squad features a mix of experience and fresh faces. While the 31 have over 1,000 caps between them, Ludlam, Singleton, Heinz and McConnochie have just the three among the four of them. The first three debuted against Wales, while McConnochie was in line to feature before being sidelined late with a hip injury. Dan Cole and Ben Youngs have 86 caps apiece, and along with Courtney Lawes will be featuring in their third World Cup. So \u2026 it\u2019s a bad day for Brad Shields, Harry Williams, Ben Spencer, Danny Cipriani and Charlie Ewels. Jones favours Jack Singleton as the third hooker alongside Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie. Ben Youngs and Willi Heinz are the only scrum-halves in the squad, and Kyle Sinckler and Dan Cole are the only two tighthead props. Gerard\u2019s full news piece on the announcement is here \u2026 Accompanying the announcement, Jones was quoted as saying: \u201cToday is another step in the progress towards the Rugby World Cup. We have taken the decision to go early because of what we learned from previous campaigns. We want the squad to know early and now we can get on and be the best prepared England side there has ever been, ready to win the World Cup.\u201d \u201cA lot of good players have missed out, we feel for them, I feel for them personally. But as we know the World Cup is an incredible tournament where opportunities can present themselves and all those players who have missed out have been told they have to be ready.\u201d Hot off the press \u2026 Forwards Dan Cole (Leicester, 86 caps) Luke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter, 12 caps) Tom Curry (Sale, 11 caps) Ellis Genge (Leicester, 10 caps) Jamie George (Saracens, 37 caps) Maro Itoje (Saracens, 27 caps) George Kruis (Saracens, 32 caps) Joe Launchbury (Wasps, 59 caps) Courtney Lawes (Northampton, 72 caps) Lewis Ludlam (Northampton, 1 cap) Joe Marler (Harlequins, 58 caps) Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins, 22 caps) Jack Singleton (Saracens, 1 cap) Sam Underhill (Bath, 9 caps) Billy Vunipola (Saracens, 42 caps) Mako Vunipola (Saracens, 53 caps) Mark Wilson (Newcastle/Sale, 13 caps) Backs Joe Cokanasiga (Bath, 5 caps) Elliot Daly (Saracens, 31 caps) Owen Farrell (Saracens, 70 caps) George Ford (Leicester, 56 caps) Piers Francis (Northampton, 5 caps) Willi Heinz (Gloucester, 1 cap) Jonathan Joseph (Bath, 41 caps) Jonny May (Leicester, 45 caps) Ruaridh McConnochie (Bath, uncapped) Jack Nowell (Exeter, 33 caps) Henry Slade (Exeter, 22 caps) Manu Tuilagi (Leicester, 33 caps) Anthony Watson (Bath, 34 caps) Ben Youngs (Leicester, 86 caps) Ben Te\u2019o has been left out of England\u2019s World Cup squad following his off-field altercation with Mike Brown during the recent warm-weather camp in Treviso. The 32-year-old is the biggest casualty from Jones\u2019s 31-man squad with Piers Francis preferred in his place. Lewis Ludlam and Willi Heinz have both been included after their impressive debuts against Wales on Sunday while Ruaridh McConnochie is also picked, making him the first uncapped member of an England World Cup squad since Joe Simpson in 2011. The writing was on the wall for Te\u2019o when, along with Brown, he was left out of the squad preparing to face Wales last week. Details of the pair\u2019s altercation then emerged but Jones\u2019s decision to leave him out is still a surprise considering how highly he has valued Te\u2019o\u2019s direct running in the past. Brown also misses out meaning, along with the omissions of Dylan Hartley, Chris Robshaw, Nathan Hughes and Danny Care, Jones has decided against selecting six players, until recently trusted lieutenants, who boast 361 caps between them. Squad announcement in two mins. Stand by folks \u2026 Below the line, occamsrazor42 has Cipriani in his 31 \u2026 \u201cWas at the game yesterday, and was slightly surprised (not for the first time) at how differently people view the same game. I thought Heinz was a terrible failed experiment. I\u2019ve never been a massive Youngs fan, but Heinz seemed to too often put pressure on the first receiver when there was no gain to it. That\u2019s a cardinal sin for a SH, in my book. I thought Francis/JJ/ Daly had poor games (though Daly has a fair amount of credit in the bank). Ludlam has bulk but not sure it\u2019s his time yet. Thought Genge was excellent, as was Curry before his injury. In terms of people who might not make the plane based on that: Ludlam, Heinz, Francis, Ewels JJ should be sweating. Given we have Slade, Farrell, Manu, Daly, Te\u2019o, Lozowski who can all play centre.\u201d Majorbumsore adds: \u201cSome of Heinz\u2019s passing yesterday, especially off the left hand, was woefully inaccurate.\u201d Fifteen minutes out from the announcement, a quick reminder of what happens next: England have three more World Cup warm-up matches: 17 Aug: Wales v England, Principality Stadium 24 Aug: England v Ireland, Twickenham 6 Sept: England v Italy, St James\u2019 Park Two days after the Italy match comes the hard deadline for all squads to be named. Hosts Japan face Russia in the tournament opener on 20 September, and soon afterwards Jones\u2019s side start their campaign\u2026 Rugby World Cup, Group C 22 Sept: England v Tonga, Sapporo Dome 26 Sept: England v USA, Kobe Misaki Stadium 5 Oct: England v Argentina, Tokyo Stadium 12 Oct: England v France, International Stadium Yokohama Stuart Barnes tells Sky Sports News: \u201cEddie Jones is like a juggler.\u201d Not a slight, I promise \u2013 he was complimenting the coach\u2019s capacity to see the big picture. The former England fly-half also sees a potential way in for Piers Francis, and notes the impact injuries could play before the tournament proper: \u201cNot all of the 31 will be going to Japan.\u201d Jones also, apparently unprompted, lunged head-first at all officials everywhere. This from Gerard Meagher\u2019s news piece \u2026 Referring to the red card shown to New Zealand\u2019s Scott Barrett in the All Blacks\u2019 record defeat by Australia on Saturday, he described the decision as \u201cridiculous\u201d and urged World Rugby to find some consistency. He also claimed that following the same letter of the law, there were two incidents in England\u2019s impressive win against Wales that could have warranted red cards, believed to be tackles by Aled Davies and Ross Moriarty on George Ford and Piers Francis respectively. The referee during the Bledisloe Cup match, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s, showed Barrett a red card in accordance with a revised \u201csanction framework\u201d, introduced by World Rugby following a summit in Paris in March. Jones has previously been part of the governing body\u2019s law review group, which has looked at ways of enhancing player safety in the tackle, but he believes Barrett\u2019s red card \u2013 awarded for a shoulder charge on Michael Hooper \u2013 was the wrong decision. \u201cI thought it was ridiculous,\u201d Jones said. \u201cA bloke gets tackled, he goes to be second man in and his shoulder hits his head and he gets a red card. We can\u2019t have that in the game. What I\u2019m saying is that we need to have some consistency and common sense.\u201d After the Wales match, Jones did some talking \u2026 On the warm-ups: These sorts of matches are about developing your own game and I thought the players worked really hard, put in a good display and if you were one of the 80,000 supporters here today you\u2019d be wanting to come back and watch the side play again and that can only be a good thing.\u201d On Lewis Ludlam: He\u2019s a good uncomplicated player. He carries hard, tackles hard, his clear out is hard. He looks people in the eye and is a good kid. I was pleased for the young guys playing today. It\u2019s a special moment for them.\u201d On how none of us should read anything into anything: The World Cup is six weeks away and we are conscious of that and if you want to go all the way it\u2019s another seven weeks, so that\u2019s 13 weeks. Momentum is hard to carry for that amount of time. So all we want to do is get a little bit better as we go along. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting and we are looking forward to finalising the squad of 31 tomorrow. This game was never going to be a be all and end all selection. You get to know which players are going to be able to do it.\u201d Speaking of long-term plans etc, and with apologies to anyone clicking in, seeing a list of names and assuming this is the actual squad omigod it\u2019s announced it\u2019s announced, here\u2019s the training squad Jones named in July. Could be interesting for comparison later \u2026 Archive: 4 July \u2013 England\u2019s 38-man training squad Forwards Dan Cole (Leicester); Luke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter); Tom Curry (Sale); Charlie Ewels (Bath); Ellis Genge (Leicester); Jamie George (Saracens); Maro Itoje (Saracens); Joe Launchbury (Wasps); Courtney Lawes (Northampton); Lewis Ludlam (Northampton); Joe Marler (Harlequins); Ben Moon (Exeter); Brad Shields (Wasps); Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins); Jack Singleton (Saracens); Sam Underhill (Bath); Billy Vunipola (Saracens); Harry Williams (Exeter); Mark Wilson (Sale). Backs Danny Cipriani (Gloucester); Joe Cokanasiga (Bath); Elliot Daly (Saracens); Owen Farrell (Saracens); George Ford (Leicester); Piers Francis (Northampton); Willi Heinz (Gloucester); Jonathan Joseph (Bath); Jonny May (Leicester); Ruaridh McConnochie (Bath); Henry Slade (Exeter); Ben Spencer (Saracens); Ben Te\u2019o (unattached); Manu Tuilagi (Leicester); Anthony Watson (Bath); Ben Youngs (Leicester). In camp for rehabilitation George Kruis (Saracens); Jack Nowell (Exeter); Mako Vunipola (Saracens). Afternoon, all. The Japan 2019 countdown ramps up today with a good-and-early squad announcement from Eddie Jones. While eyebrows have been raised at the England coach scheduling his announcement quite so far ahead of the 8 September deadline, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been champing at the bit for this tournament for quite some time. Back in November 2017 Jones said his backroom team were already up to a 10th draft of their World Cup plan, while he was on top of travel logistics, helped immeasurably by his experience working in Japan. Last May he turned up the heat and humidity at their Bagshot base, and since then every training camp and squad selection has been made while eyeing up the big kick-off against Tonga in Sapporo on 22 September. So who will make his final 31? As Jones said before the Wales match: \u201cEvery day is selection day. We talk to players every day, seeing how they act, how they respond, how much they want to play for England, how they want to be part of a team, how they can develop from being a good club player to an international one. The match against Wales is just one of a number of selection days; no one is going to be selected or not on one match.\u201d Last Friday Robert Kitson picked a possible 31, a sinfully difficult task while Jones openly admitted he was still weighing up his midfield, full-back and scrum-half options. Full-back Mike Brown and centre Ben Te\u2019o were dropped from the experimental squad that warmed up so effectively against Wales, which would lessen the shock of their exclusion. Other questions remain, of course. Joe Marler gave the coach sufficient notice of his U-turn on availability \u2026 right? Gloucester scrum-half Willi Heinz, meanwhile, has suddenly risen to help take the tally of players capped by Jones since 2016 to an eye-watering 70. Lewis Ludlam impressed too, while Joe Marchant and Jack Singleton now also have caps that would add substance to their selection. Injuries, as always, may play a part \u2013 Ruaridh McConnochie was widely backed to be on standby for Jack Nowell \u2026 until the Bath flyer suffered injury of his own. Henry Slade and Sam Underhill could be nervous too \u2013 their setbacks may be minor, but the weekend before a squad unveiling is not the best time to be on the sidelines. Stand by your beds, folks. Announcement and reaction incoming (due 1pm BST). Let the wild speculation begin.",

      "bodyText": "Significant environmental concerns have been raised about plans to build a large salmon farm just off the coast of Canna, a tiny Hebridean island near Skye. Mowi, the world\u2019s largest salmon producer, has tabled outline plans to install eight fish farm cages to grow thousands of tonnes of organic salmon in one of the most environmentally protected areas of sea in the UK. The cages would be 160 metres in circumference, the largest installed in the UK, after Scottish ministers relaxed rules in an effort to push salmon farms further offshore to reduce the pollution and welfare problems that dog the industry. The eight pens would cover nearly 16,300 sq metres, more than twice the size of a football pitch, with moorings stretching over 222,000 sq metres of seabed. Scottish Natural Heritage, the government\u2019s conservation watchdog, has said Mowi\u2019s proposals could lead to \u201csignificant environmental effects\u201d on the area\u2019s seabirds, porpoises and seals, and threaten other rare marine life on the seabed. There are also fears about the impact on Canna\u2019s small community of 18 people, which has recently had problems with incomers unable to integrate and settle there, in part because of its isolation and harsh winter weather. Mowi has said it will employ 10 people at the site and has offered jobs to islanders, suggesting that outsiders will also need to be based on Canna year-round. That creates challenges for the National Trust for Scotland, which owns Canna and has struggled to repopulate the island.

Now we agree that the way to avert climate catastrophe is to wind back the clocks, how much of the environment have we permanently damaged? It begins in a garden of Eden, where a man pulls an apple from a solitary tree and gives it to his companion to eat. There are moments when the show tries the patience, but by the end we are dazzled by the company\u2019s clever conceit and also challenged by the scale of the eco problem ahead. <strong>MF<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/07/are-we-not-drawn-onward-to-new-era-review-zoo-southside-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>The End</strong><br><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/end\">Summerhall, 11.30am, until 25 August</a><br>This impossibly beautiful duet sees ramshackle dance duo Bertrand Lesca and Nasi Voutsas, known as <a href=\"https://bertandnasi.com/home\">Bert and Nasi</a>, imagine a future without each other. The end of the world is told in two parts at the same time. The first is shown on a screen, where a hastily put together slideshow squares up to the future and details how everything will crumble \u2013 their relationship, their lives, their world, their words. The second is through dance as Bert and Nasi try out movements like a tasting menu, making the most of the time they have left. <strong>KW<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/19/the-end-review-summerhall-edinburgh-bert-and-nasi\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Your Sexts Are Shit: Older Better Letters<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/your-sexts-are-shit-older-better-letters\">Summerhall, 11.30am, until 25 August</a><strong><br></strong>Rachel Mars\u2019s triumphant show is an education in how to talk dirty.

Mars is the ideal narrator, showing childish glee at the queef jokes but not a hint of judgment for these proudly grimy cultural icons. Contrasting these dusty pages with messages from dating apps and WhatsApp, Mars celebrates how all these intimate messages \u2013 from a woman describing how she wants to be licked to a reminder to pick up milk \u2013 make up our relationships. <strong>KW<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/16/sex-education-oh-yes-oh-no-your-sexts-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Bystanders<br></strong><a href=\"https://festival19.summerhall.co.uk/event/cardboard-citizens-bystanders/\">Summerhall, 11.40am, until 25 August</a><br>Adrian Jackson\u2019s gutsy, ferociously acted production jumps back and forth between a sequence of not-quite-verbatim scenes that remind us of the way homelessness has become a bit-part player in the news cycle, as if it is now an acceptable part of everyday life.

Two eager little insects creep through the reeds of grass, both on the hunt for the same leaf dangling from above. With playful staging and simple language, The Herd, a theatre company from Hull, have created a microscopic world of epic adventure. To a gorgeously placed score, Slug and Caterpillar slither in and out of joy and tantrums. There is one heartbreaking moment when Slug realises she can\u2019t turn into a butterfly \u2013 but the show always finds its way back to the light.

The tone veers between wholesomely innocent and darkly shocking, as the camp and our hosts unravel.

The result is a lovely showcase for Booth-Steel\u2019s warmth and stoical wit.

What marks them out from most sketch groups is a kind of formality, not just in the suits they wear but in the ritualistic nods that they exchange after each sketch. Their big YouTube hit \u2013 about ordering a coffee when you have an Irish name \u2013 is one of the better skits, as is the unromantic retelling of Titanic. The show is pacy and slick and the performances strong, but the gentle ribbing of everyday observations can be too gentle. <strong>PF<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/19/edinburgh-sketch-shows-roundup\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Sea Sick</strong><br><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sea-sick\">Canada Hub @ Kings Hall, 12.30pm, until 25 August</a><br>You thought you had enough on your plate with global heating? Think again. Canadian journalist Alanna Mitchell\u2019s lecture-theatre show is a clarion call about a related, but underexplored phenomenon: the rocketing acidity of the world\u2019s oceans. It\u2019s bad news for sealife \u2013 but bad news for us, too, whose every second breath comes from plankton in the sea. Mitchell casts herself as an accidental discoverer of this biggest story of her career, turned dogged pursuer of the truth, as she observes coral spawning, deep dives to the sea bed and investigates all-new undersea dead zones where marine life once teemed. The balance between biography and science is adroitly done, turning terrifying data into a story of a woman wrestling against the weight of the tale she has to tell. She tells it superbly. <strong>BL</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74bec41ab58697a10fe813f4331c3abc5265098d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74bec41ab58697a10fe813f4331c3abc5265098d/0_0_3024_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sadie Clark in Algorithms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From bad sex to a bad haircut \u2026 Sadie Clark in Algorithms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Algorithms<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/algorithms\">Pleasance Courtyard, 12.45pm, until 26 August</a><br>Every now and then and then on the fringe you stumble into a newcomer\u2019s show that is so telly- or radio-ready it\u2019s startling. Surely Sadie Clark\u2019s neatly conceived comedy \u2013 promoted as a \u201cbisexual Bridget Jones for the online generation\u201d \u2013 will be snapped up for TV or radio. Clark plays Brooke, who is rebounding from her last relationship and hurtling towards a 30th birthday she desperately wants to celebrate with a new partner. So the hyper-organised Brooke signs up for the dating site where she works but soon finds there\u2019s no logic to love and questions why her 96.8% match dates are so dull. If anything, Clark\u2019s show is almost too meticulous \u2013 a little more messiness wouldn\u2019t go amiss \u2013 but it is full of truths about falling in and out of love, and there\u2019s a cracking routine about Brooke\u2019s tendency to grin and bare it through everything from bad sex to a bad haircut. <strong>CW</strong></p> <p><strong>Wild Swimming<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/wild-swimming\">Pleasance Courtyard, 12.45, until 26 August</a><br>This exhilaratingly smart two-hander holds up time to suit itself. We start roughly at the end of the 16th century on the Dorset coast with Nell (Alice Lamb) and Oscar (Annabel Baldwin), two more-than-friends who trade in quickfire insults as they dash in and out of the sea. Then we skip forward a century but they only age a few years; Oscar\u2019s been at uni and the gap feels like 100 years to them. As we hurtle towards present day, dreams change, and with them bathing costumes, women\u2019s rights and ideas about love and adventure.

We see their cramped quarters and the rooftop overhead. We watch as they defend their independence from one another, fall in love, party, piss each other off and steal each other\u2019s biscuits. For most of its 75 minutes, it\u2019s a montage of domestic incidents. The pleasure in Pierre Guillois\u2019s production is its special effects and comic choreography, as wigs are whipped away by the wind, burst pipes extinguish pan fires, and a hi-tech toilet is activated by handclap (intentionally or otherwise).

It is 1981 and Ashley is lost in a dreamworld, turning vacuum cleaner extensions into lightsabers and bouncing around her flat like a Harlem Globetrotter. Mum works long hours at the hospital, and if Ashley doesn\u2019t shape up then there\u2019ll be a trip to the dreaded Mrs Cole.

In a lively blend of spoken-word poetry and night-on-the-tiles narrative, she describes a town of which she is less proud than protective, meeting hippies in the Art Bar and hallucinating about the statue of Robert Burns, while recalibrating her relationships with friends, family and the landscape of her youth. <strong>MF<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/19/landscape-plays-edinbugh-2019\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>The Happiness Project</strong><br><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/happiness-project\">Army @ the Fringe, 2.20pm, until 25 August</a><br>Those who believe millennials are self-absorbed, narcissistic snowflakes will find plenty to get steamed up by in this show made by a young, five-strong creative troupe dressed in pink and acid yellow. Combining monologues and physical theatre, it\u2019s a journey through modern worries and preoccupations, from porn addiction to sleep hygiene, via social media and the thought of having children.

Dressed in white, Bellus is nervy and wide-eyed.

He\u2019s held back at school, frequently in trouble over misunderstandings, but comes into his own when playing drums. By the end, it becomes his way of connecting to the world. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a musical instrument, it\u2019s a beating heart,\u201d says Bellus and, in St\u00e9phane Batlle\u2019s production, he has the charm and musical dexterity to make us feel it. <strong>MF<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/14/beat-snare-keith-moon-the-real-me-review-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Read the review</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cn3OBfLSzU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Cn3OBfLSzU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Spray</strong><br><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/spray\">Assembly Roxy, 2.35pm, until 26 August</a><br>Fancy a trippy physical comedy show inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and set against the stresses of modern-day Seoul? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cn3OBfLSzU\">Cho-</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cn3OBfLSzU\">In theatre company\u2019s wacky hour</a> follows a clammy-handed shoe salesman permanently worried about putting a foot wrong.

Though set in the 1980s, it\u2019s an Edwardian-style tale of a troupe of variety performers including the mysterious Madame Canard and the duck of the title. Thanks to Campe\u2019s dramatic delivery and enviable turn of phrase, it\u2019s also very funny. Created by Naomi Paxton, Campe employs her considerable charm to recruit audience members to aid her in her flights of fancy (one plays an escaped moose) and to join her in a concluding dance. It\u2019s a world as convincing as it is amusing, both eccentric and deeply researched.<strong> AN</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e1df4365c5f812a495d9307d2b235095866e5222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1df4365c5f812a495d9307d2b235095866e5222/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smart debate \u2026 Anguis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smart debate \u2026 Anguis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Anguis<br></strong><a href=\"https://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/event/1370158-anguis/\">Gilded Balloon Teviot, 3pm, until 26 August</a><br>Sheila Atim might have stumbled on a new radio format.

All of Me used to be one kind of show about depression. But during the making of this show, Horton became ill again. So now All of Me is unashamedly bleak, resisting the redemptive narrative arc that is so often expected from plays about mental health. It\u2019s messy. It could hardly be otherwise.

Now the \u201cbedsit anarchist\u201d is back. The world has changed, but has he? His old jokes about the Birmingham Six, the DHSS and the Thatcher years rub shoulders with material on feminism and climate change. He\u2019s so into Extinction Rebellion that he has a graph of CO2 emissions drawn on his bomber jacket. However, his attempts to be a good feminist only betray him as being a very bad one. In this era of political crises and 140-character takedowns, Parker might lack punch, but there is something appealing about a character in his 50s who still wants to change the world \u2013 even if he\u2019s the least-equipped person to do it. <strong>PF<br></strong><a href=\"http://https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/22/simon-munnery-review-edinburgh-2019\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Jonny Pelham: Off Limits<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/jonny-pelham-off-limits\">The Caves, 3.20pm, until 25 August</a><br>An iron law of Edinburgh shows is that your trauma is your big reveal. So it\u2019s a jolt in more ways than one when Jonny Pelham tells us, right up top, that he was sexually assaulted at the age of eight. That\u2019s not an obvious topic for comedy \u2013 but, with its flights of fantasy, awkward sexual encounters and opportunities for jet-black humour, it turns out to be a very good one. Sad stuff, but there\u2019s nothing sentimental about the show, which Pelham delivers with much self-mockery and no self-pity. A striking show, and far more fun than the subject gives us any right to expect. <strong>BL<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/18/jonny-pelham-review-edinburgh-2019\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>George Fouracres: Gentlemon<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/george-fouracres-gentlemon\">Pleasance Courtyard, 3.30pm, until 25 August</a><br>This is an autobiographical set about Fouracres\u2019 upbringing in the post-industrial Black Country, a hymn to a world he thinks is disappearing, a rumination on class identity and social mobility \u2013 and a distinctive maiden solo show. Fouracres emerges as much pen-portraitist as either actor or standup. Proceedings only occasionally shade into working-class cliche \u2013 and, when your grandad is both a brickie and pigeon fancier, how can you avoid it? It\u2019s a tender-hearted paean to The Way We Lived Then, with jokes that are by turns joyous, barbed and unresolved. <strong>BL<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/09/george-fouracres-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Not Today\u2019s Yesterday</strong><br><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/not-today-s-yesterday\">Zoo Southside, 3.40pm, until 24 August</a><br>Australian choreographer Lina Limosani and British <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam\">Bharatanatyam</a> artist Seeta Patel take to task rightwing revisionism and the whitewashing of colonial history in this deft and pertinent piece of dance theatre. Spry and fluently expressive, Patel mesmerises with the expansive curlicue of her arms and the firefly flutter of her fingers, while a voiceover places us firmly in the realm of exotic myth. But saccharine fairytale soon merges with realpolitik as the voiceover gives way to a jarring collage of cut-glass reportage and familiar oratory, including a hint of Thatcher.

How can she be brave when she feels such intense guilt and helplessness? Instead of facing up to it, she snaps, hitting the streets of her Newport home town. As a woman delving into her soul on a stolen BMX, Dalgleish gives an impassioned performance, catching the agony of a woman who needs to come to terms with her own vulnerabilities before finding the strength to tend to someone else. <strong>MF<br></strong><a href=\"http://https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/23/how-to-be-brave-review-edinburgh-2019\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Since U Been Gone<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/since-u-been-gone\">Assembly Roxy, 3.45pm, until 24 August</a><br>The ache of lost time is contained in Teddy Lamb\u2019s delicate monologue grappling with grief and gender.

The story he\u2019s telling, however, couldn\u2019t be heavier \u2013 aged 17, he was infected with HIV by an older boyfriend the first time he had sex. Hall tells the story of how he struggled out from under the stigma still imposed on people with HIV, and gives a gentle \u2013 and funny \u2013 sex education lesson on the way.

In one particularly effective sequence, a single dancer prepares, with jittery intensity, for a series of balances and turns, each time crashing to the floor.

And as Rosenthal admits, the polemic can overshadow the comedy, , but it\u2019s a striking show, raising questions and laughter in equal measure.<strong> BL</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/14/tom-rosenthal-manhood-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Pops<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/pops\">Assembly Roxy, 6.35pm, until 25 August</a><br>In Charlotte Josephine\u2019s play, the real drama lives and breathes in what\u2019s not said.

Over an hour, we investigate the story through a podcast-style voiceover, contextual and atmospheric film, media reports from the time \u2013 and most of all, through the dance and physical theatre of four young female performers, playing the girls who couldn\u2019t be cured, and who then disappeared.

The result is an evening that veers from lullaby to prayer to howl, with O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s voice as breathtaking as ever, like a star exploding in the sky. <strong>CW</strong></p> <p><strong>Jordan Brookes: I\u2019ve Got Nothing<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/jordan-brookes-i-ve-got-nothing\">Pleasance Courtyard, 9.10pm, until 25 August</a><br>The conceit of I\u2019ve Got Nothing is that Jordan Brookes is winging this encounter with an audience. He cuts to the big issues (his self-loathing, our hunger for connection, the imminent end of the world) and addresses them seemingly without guile. In between, he drops non-sequitur gags which may be a key to something more significant. None of this plays by comedy\u2019s usual rules. It\u2019s always gripping, and he pulls the rug out from under our expectations of how standup shows end, and tearing that rug to shreds. One of the comic coups of this year\u2019s fringe. <strong>BL<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/17/jordan-brookes-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">Read the review</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2d0d5acc723b47ff1ce22521188e6d8a3b6314d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2d0d5acc723b47ff1ce22521188e6d8a3b6314d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Brookes: I\u2019ve Got Nothing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Brookes: I\u2019ve Got Nothing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Demi Lardner: Ditch Witch 800</strong><br><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/demi-lardner-ditch-witch-800\">Gilded Balloon Teviot, 9.15pm, until 26 August</a><br>You never know what\u2019s coming next in Ditch Witch 800, a fizzing 50 minutes of sketches, doodles, one-liners, daft dances and out-of-nowhere jingles.

The thread running through the show is that the venue is out to get them, snagging them on hooks and throttling them with the mic lead. The sketches themselves are frequently a delight, often riffing on TV tropes: they have a brainbox detective who stuffs up bad, a Monopoly debt enforcer and a rail operator who thinks he\u2019s stuck in the world of Thomas the Tank Engine. There are unpredictable reveals and a few smartypants manoeuvres.

He drifts towards his ancestral Hinduism, saying myths are more consoling than facts and \u201cbelief helps\u201d in his battle against depression. If that doesn\u2019t sound like a truckload of laughs, he finds both humour and poetry in his existential angst. There are no pat conclusions but there\u2019s a real ring of truth and hard-won humour in this portrait of an overthinker marooned between youth and adulthood, materialism and faith, between distant dying suns and holes in the floor of heaven. <strong>BL<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/06/ahir-shah-dots-review-monkey-barrel-comedy-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Read the review</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fec252281b5073a538d40e41ad8b2e1d3af1cfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fec252281b5073a538d40e41ad8b2e1d3af1cfb/0_1359_4380_2628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humour and poetry \u2026 Ahir Shah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humour and poetry \u2026 Ahir Shah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Arthur<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/arthur\">Your home, Edinburgh, until 25 August</a><br>When the show stars a five-month-old boy, as it does in Daniel Bye\u2019s riveting two-hander, there is no predicting how all the sleeping, feeding and playing will pan out. Arthur has the added variant of being staged in your living room; performances are by request via the number in the fringe programme. Bye\u2019s theme is nature versus nurture and the way the exact same set of genes can produce very different looking plants, animals and human beings, according to the tiniest environmental variant.

Yes, its two female characters are each struggling with how best to be a daughter to their deteriorating father, but really Daughterhood is about what it means to be a sister. Miles sharply observes the complex, envy-laced relationship between siblings to forge a slender, tightly focused play whose nonlinear structure cleverly serves the material. Details are revealed at precisely the right moment, uncovering the reasons for long-buried resentment or flipping earlier assumptions on their heads. <strong>CL<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/09/daughterhood-review-roundabout-summerhall-edinburgh\">Read the review</a></p> <p><strong>Until the Flood<br></strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/until-the-flood\">Traverse, until 25 August</a><br>Dael Orlandersmith uses the 2014 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer as the catalyst for Until the Flood, which digs into the aftermath of the shooting and unearths ugly truths about race in the United States.

By rights, you shouldn\u2019t be able to see them at all: the single mother was reportedly taken aback when they wound up in cinemas and even on television. For playwright Gina Moxley, the casual exploitation of a woman\u2019s private life is symptomatic of a society in which women exist to be framed, examined and exploited.

In a small room, they begin with a slow, almost motionless dance, showing different faces of themselves as they line up in horizontal and vertical arrangements. Eventually, the eight sit down in front of us and take turns giving true and false details about themselves. Then you put on headphones. The performer before you stares into your eyes while you listen to a recording of them talking. Behind the casual conversational remarks they made in public, you hear personal stories usually reserved for intimate acquaintances.

But if the format is familiar, the telling is supremely assured. Sexy Lamp is full of sharp insights into the ways actors are exploited \u2013 groomed, even \u2013 by the machinations of an entire industry.

Cutting away from her hair-raising tale of festival excess, Burch relates a brief history of IQ tests: how they were designed to support but later segregated the \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d, a category that in the US came with a heavy racial bias.

Its short scenes relate true-life stories not just of child abuse, rape and sex trafficking but also of the more insidious ways women are kept in their place. This consciousness-raising is likely to be more necessary in a patriarchal Nigeria than in the UK, where fourth-wave feminism has its own set of concerns. That cultural difference makes the show less a source of political empowerment than a heartening vision of resistance and emancipation.

On land and water, the girls are living through times of stress: Arran guilt-stricken for a failure in animal husbandry, Eilidh exasperated by her island\u2019s economic decline.

Adults can sit back or join in with the mini-moshers encouraged to bust their best moves and squeeze in as much hand-clapping and head-banging as possible. All three guitarists and the drummer take a turn at the mic. The genial group comprises members of Girls in Hawaii, Hallo Kosmo and Italian Boyfriend; they play their own tracks as well as the Beatles, the Clash and Fran\u00e7oise Hardy.

Now we agree that the way to avert climate catastrophe is to wind back the clocks, how much of the environment have we permanently damaged? It begins in a garden of Eden, where a man pulls an apple from a solitary tree and gives it to his companion to eat.

The end of the world is told in two parts at the same time. The first is shown on a screen, where a hastily put together slideshow squares up to the future and details how everything will crumble \u2013 their relationship, their lives, their world, their words. The second is through dance as Bert and Nasi try out movements like a tasting menu, making the most of the time they have left. KW Read the review Your Sexts Are Shit: Older Better Letters Summerhall, 11.30am, until 25 August Rachel Mars\u2019s triumphant show is an education in how to talk dirty. Or rather, write dirty. She reads erotic letters from James Joyce, Georgia O\u2019Keefe and Proust, and the words drip with uninhibited desire. Mars is the ideal narrator, showing childish glee at the queef jokes but not a hint of judgment for these proudly grimy cultural icons.

Two eager little insects creep through the reeds of grass, both on the hunt for the same leaf dangling from above. With playful staging and simple language, The Herd, a theatre company from Hull, have created a microscopic world of epic adventure. To a gorgeously placed score, Slug and Caterpillar slither in and out of joy and tantrums. There is one heartbreaking moment when Slug realises she can\u2019t turn into a butterfly \u2013 but the show always finds its way back to the light.

We are immersed in a holiday camp (Ginster\u2019s Paradise) with Cantrill and Gledhill playing the \u201csalmon coats\u201d.

So began a journey through the depths of physical and mental ill-health, which Booth-Steel took to chronicling in musical form when her mum bought her a ukulele. The result is a lovely showcase for Booth-Steel\u2019s warmth and stoical wit.

BL Read the review Just These Please: Suitable Gilded Balloon, 12.15pm, until 26 August Sketch quartet Just These Please have the YouTube numbers (22m views) if not quite the show to match. What marks them out from most sketch groups is a kind of formality, not just in the suits they wear but in the ritualistic nods that they exchange after each sketch. Their big YouTube hit \u2013 about ordering a coffee when you have an Irish name \u2013 is one of the better skits, as is the unromantic retelling of Titanic.

PF Read the review Sea Sick Canada Hub @ Kings Hall, 12.30pm, until 25 August You thought you had enough on your plate with global heating? Think again. Canadian journalist Alanna Mitchell\u2019s lecture-theatre show is a clarion call about a related, but underexplored phenomenon: the rocketing acidity of the world\u2019s oceans. It\u2019s bad news for sealife \u2013 but bad news for us, too, whose every second breath comes from plankton in the sea. Mitchell casts herself as an accidental discoverer of this biggest story of her career, turned dogged pursuer of the truth, as she observes coral spawning, deep dives to the sea bed and investigates all-new undersea dead zones where marine life once teemed. The balance between biography and science is adroitly done, turning terrifying data into a story of a woman wrestling against the weight of the tale she has to tell. She tells it superbly. BL Algorithms Pleasance Courtyard, 12.45pm, until 26 August Every now and then and then on the fringe you stumble into a newcomer\u2019s show that is so telly- or radio-ready it\u2019s startling. Surely Sadie Clark\u2019s neatly conceived comedy \u2013 promoted as a \u201cbisexual Bridget Jones for the online generation\u201d \u2013 will be snapped up for TV or radio. Clark plays Brooke, who is rebounding from her last relationship and hurtling towards a 30th birthday she desperately wants to celebrate with a new partner. So the hyper-organised Brooke signs up for the dating site where she works but soon finds there\u2019s no logic to love and questions why her 96.8% match dates are so dull. If anything, Clark\u2019s show is almost too meticulous \u2013 a little more messiness wouldn\u2019t go amiss \u2013 but it is full of truths about falling in and out of love, and there\u2019s a cracking routine about Brooke\u2019s tendency to grin and bare it through everything from bad sex to a bad haircut. CW Wild Swimming Pleasance Courtyard, 12.45, until 26 August This exhilaratingly smart two-hander holds up time to suit itself. We start roughly at the end of the 16th century on the Dorset coast with Nell (Alice Lamb) and Oscar (Annabel Baldwin), two more-than-friends who trade in quickfire insults as they dash in and out of the sea. Then we skip forward a century but they only age a few years; Oscar\u2019s been at uni and the gap feels like 100 years to them. As we hurtle towards present day, dreams change, and with them bathing costumes, women\u2019s rights and ideas about love and adventure. But through it all, they come back to each other, hilarious and hungry for each other\u2019s attention. Deliciously immodest, formally inventive and searingly clever. KW F Off Underbelly Cowgate, 12.50pm, until 25 August A week is a decade online, as the National Youth Theatre demonstrate in this scatty meditation on social media, politics and data usage. The audience are asked to be the jury in the trial of the people v Mark Zuckerberg; a mum standing to be MP starts working with a conniving tech company while her daughter starts DMing a stranger on Twitter. Tatty Hennessy\u2019s script attacks both ends of the political spectrum and delves smartly into racial politics, hypocrisy and questions of accountability. KW Read the review Fishbowl Pleasance Courtyard, 1pm, until 26 August This wordless comedy is about three neighbours at the top of a Parisian apartment block. We see their cramped quarters and the rooftop overhead. We watch as they defend their independence from one another, fall in love, party, piss each other off and steal each other\u2019s biscuits. For most of its 75 minutes, it\u2019s a montage of domestic incidents. The pleasure in Pierre Guillois\u2019s production is its special effects and comic choreography, as wigs are whipped away by the wind, burst pipes extinguish pan fires, and a hi-tech toilet is activated by handclap (intentionally or otherwise). It\u2019s only latterly that anything resembling a plot takes shape, as one among the trio bursts the bubble, breaking free to a life elsewhere. BL Read the review The Accident Did Not Take Place Pleasance Courtyard, 1pm, until 26 August Actor Jim has been invited on stage for a pivotal role in a show that uses drama-school exercises to investigate the nature of truth. He hasn\u2019t seen the script before; on another day, it\u2019ll be a different guest. \u201cTell me what you will look like when you\u2019re old,\u201d he is asked in a blitzkrieg of demands. \u201cTell me what you look like when you\u2019re relaxed.\u201d In the end, this is not exactly about fake news, but something to do with the uncertainty of truth in a mediated world and the unknowability of people when all you have to go on are appearances. It\u2019s lively, exploratory and done in good humour, but could be more explicit about the connection to our post-truth world. MF Read the review Life Is No Laughing Matter Summerhall, 1pm, until 18 August Demi Nandhra focuses on her experience of depression and the inadequate care she was offered. One doctor prescribed exercise and bananas; another suggested Nandhra might feel better if she got married. For all its deceptive lightness, Life Is No Laughing Matter is making a serious and necessary intervention. As Nandhra stresses in a rage-fuelled closing monologue, depression won\u2019t be solved through stories of recovery, expensive \u201cwellness\u201d products or inspirational hashtags. CL Read the review Vigil Summerhall, 1pm, until 25 August Projected on to the wall at the back of the stage are names like jumping anchovy, indefatigable Galapagos mouse, psychedelic rock gecko. They\u2019re three of the 26,000 species that have either recently become extinct or are in danger of becoming so, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Performer Tom Bailey tries to bring these species back to life by imagining what they behaved like with his body. As he fails, Vigil forces us to confront the mass extinction event we\u2019re living through. Beautiful, contemplative, sometimes funny and not at all preachy, this is a remarkable and urgent show. AN Read about more Edinburgh climate crisis shows Beach Body Ready Pleasance Courtyard, 1.10pm, until 26 August This won\u2019t all be cheesy inspirational mottos and #bodypositivity, warn performers Rachael Abbey, Jess Morley and Sarah Penney. Beach Body Ready is a show about finding joy in your body, but it\u2019s also honest about all the forces eroding that joy, from women\u2019s magazines to Instagram filters. It\u2019s less about labels such as \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cskinny\u201d and more about the myriad ways in which society polices women\u2019s bodies and saps their energy. By unapologetically taking up space with their bodies and their experiences, the performers refuse to be shamed into silence. CL Read the review Collapsible Assembly Roxy, 1.20pm, until 25 August Breffni Holahan gives a searing performance as Essie in Margaret Perry\u2019s corrosive play about a woman\u2019s disintegration. Essie is trapped atop a stone plinth dusted in dirt. Gigantic spikes of rock splinter the air around her. Her feet dangle. Having lost her job and broken up with her girlfriend, she is in every way ungrounded. This is where Perry\u2019s play is rooted: in the queasy gap between her feet and the floor. Perry\u2019s writing is as sharp as the rocky spikes, exact in its disdain for the ways the modern world overwhelms. KW Read the review For All I Care Summerhall, 1.30pm, until 25 August The spirit of Nye Bevan floats over Alan Harris\u2019s monologue for National Theatre Wales. The architect of the NHS is there in the historic leaflet Hannah Daniel\u2019s Nyri finds among her late mother\u2019s belongings, promising medical care free at the point of use for the first time. And he\u2019s there in the uncritical attention the doctors give to the same actor\u2019s Clara, a vulnerable young woman who has set herself on fire during a shoplifting expedition. The script is limited in its political range. But, in Jac Ifan Moore\u2019s clean, spare production, Daniel is bright, lucid and engaging, bringing life to Harris\u2019s vivid script. MF Read the review Mythos, a Trilogy Festival theatre, 1.30pm, until 25 August Sitting centre stage in a leather armchair, Stephen Fry remains jovial, avuncular and head-spinningly capable of retaining the details of whole families of gods, heroes and men throughout this three-part seven-and-a-half-hour show retelling the ancient Greek myths. Fry steers us through stories of bravery, cunning and struggle with boyish enthusiasm, his voice rounded and reassuring. MF I\u2019ll Take You to Mrs Cole! Pleasance Courtyard, 1.45pm, until 26 August From its zigzagging Coventry skyline to the black-and-white checked kitchen, Jemima Robinson\u2019s set is like a 2 Tone album cover for this family show, which mixes fantasy with harsh reality, maintaining the upbeat energy and rumbling tensions of its ska soundtrack. It is 1981 and Ashley is lost in a dreamworld, turning vacuum cleaner extensions into lightsabers and bouncing around her flat like a Harlem Globetrotter. Mum works long hours at the hospital, and if Ashley doesn\u2019t shape up then there\u2019ll be a trip to the dreaded Mrs Cole. But the real villain is a milk-snatcher in this kids\u2019 show rooted in 1980s politics and imaginatively staged by Complicit\u00e9 Associates and London\u2019s Polka theatre. CW Art Heist Underbelly, 1.55pm, until 25 August Art Heist looks like a slight but entertaining crime caper. Borrowing playfully from films such as Mission: Impossible, its opening minutes present us with three would-be art thieves, each on a quest to steal the same famous painting. One is a slick professional robber; another is an art heist aficionado who\u2019s been waiting his whole life for this moment; the third has fallen desperately in love with the artwork in question. Immediately, the comic possibilities are ample. But beneath its often hilarious gags and comic chaos the show worries away at questions of value, meaning and expression. CL Read the review It\u2019ll Be Alt-Right on the Night Pleasance Courtyard, 2pm, until 26 August Matthew Greenhough\u2019s (almost) new solo show asks whether we are \u201ctrapped in separate echo chambers\u201d and can we bridge the divides? The tale of two working-class Sheffield school friends growing up and apart is full of blunt, bathetic northern comedy, and Greenhough performs it as if he\u2019s plugged into the mains. Steven Wright on trumpet punctuates with punk tracks given a jazz makeover. BL Read the review Blood and Gold Scottish Storytelling Centre, 2pm, until 26 August In an exquisite piece of storytelling heavily abstracted from her own experience, Mara Menzies draws on her twin backgrounds in Scotland and Kenya and reminds us of the former country\u2019s uneasy history of colonialism before taking us to Africa for an Arabian Nights-like string of stories, all stalked by a metaphorical dark shadow. Performed with choreographic grace and a mesmerising delivery, she tells of journeys into new lands where the delight of discovery becomes soured by prejudice. MF Read the review Like Animals Summerhall, 2.15pm, until 25 August At a moment when we urgently need to reassess our relationship with the natural world, an exploration of human-animal connections feels timely. Kim Donohoe and Pete Lannon\u2019s sweet two-hander blurs the usually sharp division between human and not-human, while posing the question of how much we can ever really know another being. What makes us think we are entitled to rule over animals yet also communicate with them like friends? CL Ane City Assembly Roxy, 2.20pm, until 26 August Taylor Dyson\u2019s play for the young Elfie Picket company is a gutsily performed homage to Dundee, where an English literature student returns having been away in Glasgow. In a lively blend of spoken-word poetry and night-on-the-tiles narrative, she describes a town of which she is less proud than protective, meeting hippies in the Art Bar and hallucinating about the statue of Robert Burns, while recalibrating her relationships with friends, family and the landscape of her youth. MF Read the review The Happiness Project Army @ the Fringe, 2.20pm, until 25 August Those who believe millennials are self-absorbed, narcissistic snowflakes will find plenty to get steamed up by in this show made by a young, five-strong creative troupe dressed in pink and acid yellow. Combining monologues and physical theatre, it\u2019s a journey through modern worries and preoccupations, from porn addiction to sleep hygiene, via social media and the thought of having children. Occasionally it is a little obvious, but it\u2019s strongest when it makes a moving case for genuine human connection in a constantly distracted world. You might even get a hug at the end. AN Beat Pleasance Dome, 2.30pm, until 26 August \u201cIt was the drums that chose me,\u201d says Daniel Bellus\u2019s Alfie as he gets behind his kit in this Moli\u00e8re award-nominated monologue by C\u00e9dric Chapuis. Dressed in white, Bellus is nervy and wide-eyed. It\u2019s never stated, but you assume his character is on the autistic spectrum, a teenage boy who is perplexed by human interactions but blissfully content when counting out a rhythm. He\u2019s held back at school, frequently in trouble over misunderstandings, but comes into his own when playing drums. By the end, it becomes his way of connecting to the world. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a musical instrument, it\u2019s a beating heart,\u201d says Bellus and, in St\u00e9phane Batlle\u2019s production, he has the charm and musical dexterity to make us feel it. MF Read the review Spray Assembly Roxy, 2.35pm, until 26 August Fancy a trippy physical comedy show inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and set against the stresses of modern-day Seoul? Cho-In theatre company\u2019s wacky hour follows a clammy-handed shoe salesman permanently worried about putting a foot wrong. After accidentally opening a parcel for his neighbour he finds himself seduced by the thrill of stealing mail. Projections and sliding screens neatly capture the city\u2019s hustle and bustle in a show about intimate glimpses into other people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether listening to neighbours\u2019 voices, riffling through their post or handling customers\u2019 feet. It\u2019s billed for over-eights and really should come with a trigger warning for cat lovers. CW Ada Campe and the Psychic Duck The Stand\u2019s New Town theatre, 2.50pm, until 25 August With her outlandish eye makeup, headdress and conspiratorial air, Ada Campe effortlessly draws her audience into her story. Though set in the 1980s, it\u2019s an Edwardian-style tale of a troupe of variety performers including the mysterious Madame Canard and the duck of the title. Thanks to Campe\u2019s dramatic delivery and enviable turn of phrase, it\u2019s also very funny. Created by Naomi Paxton, Campe employs her considerable charm to recruit audience members to aid her in her flights of fancy (one plays an escaped moose) and to join her in a concluding dance. It\u2019s a world as convincing as it is amusing, both eccentric and deeply researched. AN Anguis Gilded Balloon Teviot, 3pm, until 26 August Sheila Atim might have stumbled on a new radio format. It\u2019s like Desert Island Discs but instead of playing records the guests pick up an acoustic guitar and sing their favourite songs. That\u2019s the idea behind this fictional broadcast in which a virologist interviews fellow women in science, showcasing their achievements so it isn\u2019t always men who get the attention. Her first guest, in a time-bending conceit, is Cleopatra, who turns out to be no mean singer-songwriter. They engage in a smart-talking debate about misrepresentation and making themselves heard \u2013 and why, if they\u2019re so confident in their abilities, they keep going on about the men. MF Read the review All of Me Summerhall, 3.10pm, until 25 August Nothing about depression \u2013 the subject of Caroline Horton\u2019s show \u2013 is comfortable or crowd-pleasing. All of Me used to be one kind of show about depression. But during the making of this show, Horton became ill again. So now All of Me is unashamedly bleak, resisting the redemptive narrative arc that is so often expected from plays about mental health. It\u2019s messy. It could hardly be otherwise. And, perhaps more surprisingly, it\u2019s beautiful. So much about depression is ugly or simply blank, but Horton is able to find a strange sort of magnificence in the darkness. CL Read the review Simon Munnery: Alan Parker Urban Warrior Farewell Tour The Stand, 3.20pm, until 26 August The last time Simon Munnery was doing his Alan Parker character, the issues of the day were the poll tax, the rainforests and Margaret Thatcher. Now the \u201cbedsit anarchist\u201d is back. The world has changed, but has he? His old jokes about the Birmingham Six, the DHSS and the Thatcher years rub shoulders with material on feminism and climate change. He\u2019s so into Extinction Rebellion that he has a graph of CO2 emissions drawn on his bomber jacket. However, his attempts to be a good feminist only betray him as being a very bad one. In this era of political crises and 140-character takedowns, Parker might lack punch, but there is something appealing about a character in his 50s who still wants to change the world \u2013 even if he\u2019s the least-equipped person to do it. PF Read the review Jonny Pelham: Off Limits The Caves, 3.20pm, until 25 August An iron law of Edinburgh shows is that your trauma is your big reveal. So it\u2019s a jolt in more ways than one when Jonny Pelham tells us, right up top, that he was sexually assaulted at the age of eight. That\u2019s not an obvious topic for comedy \u2013 but, with its flights of fantasy, awkward sexual encounters and opportunities for jet-black humour, it turns out to be a very good one. Sad stuff, but there\u2019s nothing sentimental about the show, which Pelham delivers with much self-mockery and no self-pity. A striking show, and far more fun than the subject gives us any right to expect. BL Read the review George Fouracres: Gentlemon Pleasance Courtyard, 3.30pm, until 25 August This is an autobiographical set about Fouracres\u2019 upbringing in the post-industrial Black Country, a hymn to a world he thinks is disappearing, a rumination on class identity and social mobility \u2013 and a distinctive maiden solo show. Fouracres emerges as much pen-portraitist as either actor or standup. Proceedings only occasionally shade into working-class cliche \u2013 and, when your grandad is both a brickie and pigeon fancier, how can you avoid it? It\u2019s a tender-hearted paean to The Way We Lived Then, with jokes that are by turns joyous, barbed and unresolved. BL Read the review Not Today\u2019s Yesterday Zoo Southside, 3.40pm, until 24 August Australian choreographer Lina Limosani and British Bharatanatyam artist Seeta Patel take to task rightwing revisionism and the whitewashing of colonial history in this deft and pertinent piece of dance theatre. Spry and fluently expressive, Patel mesmerises with the expansive curlicue of her arms and the firefly flutter of her fingers, while a voiceover places us firmly in the realm of exotic myth. But saccharine fairytale soon merges with realpolitik as the voiceover gives way to a jarring collage of cut-glass reportage and familiar oratory, including a hint of Thatcher. A punchy and expertly performed response to today\u2019s political grotesquerie. Read the review How to Be Brave Roundabout at Summerhall, 3.45pm, until 25 August Laura Dalgleish\u2019s Katie is a single mum relying on the hospitality of her mother while her daughter faces a perilous operation. It\u2019s not only the girl who needs to be brave. Indeed, the greater pressure is on Katie, whose adult status means she carries the responsibility. How can she be brave when she feels such intense guilt and helplessness? Instead of facing up to it, she snaps, hitting the streets of her Newport home town. As a woman delving into her soul on a stolen BMX, Dalgleish gives an impassioned performance, catching the agony of a woman who needs to come to terms with her own vulnerabilities before finding the strength to tend to someone else. MF Read the review Since U Been Gone Assembly Roxy, 3.45pm, until 24 August The ache of lost time is contained in Teddy Lamb\u2019s delicate monologue grappling with grief and gender. They address the audience as if we are their best friend \u2013 one they lost several years ago. They catch us up on news: mental health, America\u2019s Next Top Model, pronouns. They turn over the script of grief, battle through regret and emerge after an hour, a bit broken but somehow fuller, prouder, shining. Nicol Parkinson shimmers on guitar throughout, producing tender synth-pop chords and humorous twangs to match the tone of the performance. KW Read the review If You\u2019re Feeling Sinister Gilded Balloon, 3.45pm, until 26 August Eve Nichol\u2019s eccentric play with songs is somewhere between Willy Russell\u2019s Educating Rita and David Greig\u2019s Midsummer: her central characters, Kid and Boss, have a pupil-teacher relationship that\u2019s uncommonly intense, even as it falls short of romantic. The whole play is troubled by the fuzzy limits of their affair. Alan McHugh and Sarah Swire play punchily across the generation divide, singing the songs sweetly and proving themselves accomplished stars. MF Read the review Crybabies: Danger Brigade Heroes @ Boteco, 4pm, until 25 August The debut show by Crybabies is an absurd but affectionate take on old war romps such as Biggles. This buccaneering tale of defeating the Nazis and a Rat King (don\u2019t ask) is also a highly impressive showcase of their talents \u2013 Michael Clarke is the anchoring powerhouse, Ed Jones is remarkably versatile and James Gault has a beautifully natural comic instinct. Fans of Max and Ivan will be at home with their style of breakneck storytelling that packs in the gags alongside moments of poignancy. Read the review To Move in Time Summerhall, 4.05pm, until 24 August What would we do if we could travel back in time? It is a game many of us have played but few have pursued it with such dogged logic. It\u2019s performed by a measured and unflappable Tyrone Huggins with a mixture of innocent inquiry and concern about the implications of his own thought processes. He starts, as many a pub conversation would, with the small changes he would make to prevent mistakes, accidents and disasters. But the deeper he goes into this material, the more it becomes an existential meditation. Asking \u201cwhat if?\u201d is fun, but \u201cwhat now?\u201d is the truly productive question. MF Read the review Scottee: Class Assembly Roxy, 4.05pm, until 25 August In a lecture-style monologue, working-class artist Scottee adopts an abrasive tone as he schools his predominantly middle-class audience, demanding we scrutinise our attitudes towards the postcode lottery of class. While some of the dramatic techniques he uses are trite \u2013 leaving moody, puppy-eyed pauses for the sad bits to sink in and wheeling a mirror on to ask us to check our privilege \u2013 his berating monologue on the cultural capital of misery is a topic that needs more space on stage. Class knots inside you and makes you feel like crap for an hour. KW Read the review James McNicholas: The Boxer Pleasance Courtyard, 4.15pm, until 25 August Terry Downes was world middleweight boxing champion in the early 1960s. His grandson James McNicholas is a writer, actor and comedian whose biggest success was an advert for TUC biscuits. \u201cHe left big shoes to fill,\u201d McNicholas tells us \u2013 \u201ceven for a clown.\u201d But McNicholas goes some way to filling them with this gem of a show about his grandfather\u2019s life \u2013 and one his struggle to live up to it. BL Read the review Lola and Jo: Escape Assembly George Square, 4.15pm, until 25 August \u201c93% of people would rather go to an escape room than see any kind of sketch comedy,\u201d say Jackie and Leslie, facilitators of this hour-long escape room experience. Comedians Lola Stephenson and Jo Griffin have gone awol. Might the sketch scripts they left in their wake indicate their whereabouts? Solve the mystery, we\u2019re told, and we can leave the room. It\u2019s a playful conceit, even if the sketches in question (posh sisters win a literary prize; wannabe tenants interview \u2013 OK, beg \u2013 for a flatshare) don\u2019t meaningfully contribute to it. It might be stronger still if Lola and Jo\u2019s bickering \u2013 forever breaching their Leslie and Jackie disguises \u2013 had the slightest emotional significance. But it\u2019s good fun, and delivered with a likable twinkle by the not-so-disappeared duo. BL First Time Summerhall, 4.15pm, until 25 August Nathaniel Hall is a Mancunian writer and performer in his early 30s with an easy wit and charm. The story he\u2019s telling, however, couldn\u2019t be heavier \u2013 aged 17, he was infected with HIV by an older boyfriend the first time he had sex. Hall tells the story of how he struggled out from under the stigma still imposed on people with HIV, and gives a gentle \u2013 and funny \u2013 sex education lesson on the way. It\u2019s a real tribute to Hall that this story is told without self-pity, but this is a show that packs an emotional punch that resonates even after you\u2019ve left the theatre. AN The Incident Room Pleasance Courtyard, 4.30pm, until 26 August Olivia Hirst and David Byrne\u2019s play retells the Yorkshire Ripper story, turning away from the killer and examining his would-be captors by focusing on the much-criticised investigation by West Yorkshire police. Set in the titular room, the nerve centre of the hunt for an elusive murderer, it follows the long and frustrating search for clues that are far from forthcoming. CL Read the review Typical Pleasance Courtyard, 4.30pm, until 25 August Audiences may get more than they bargained for with Typical. First, it\u2019s intense and ultimately heartbreaking; second, it\u2019s performed by an uncredited Richard Blackwood - yes, that one. His hair now flecked with grey, Blackwood has lost none of his charisma, and his depiction of a black British former soldier struggling to find his place in ordinary life has subtlety and power. Typical is based on the real-life case of black ex-serviceman Christopher Alder. Blackwood and writer Ryan Calais Cameron carefully trace a day that, like a Greek tragedy, moves inexorably from hope to disaster, with hard questions to ask about institutional British racism. AN Everything I Do Summerhall, 4.30pm, until 25 August Zoe N\u00ed Riord\u00e1in would like to sing you some love songs she wrote in her shed. She goes weak at the knees, she confides in her opening number. Is it OK to love someone more than you lose yourself, she asks the front row. She slides to the floor next to a trampoline that virtually fills the stage but by the end of this thrilling bit of gig-theatre she is bouncing up and down on it, belting out empowering anthems. It\u2019s an Edinburgh show that is perfectly suited to the space: Summerhall\u2019s Demonstration room has haunting acoustics and there is enough room for that trampoline to be hoisted into the air, where it hangs like a moon. CW The Last of the Pelican Daughters Pleasance Courtyard, 4.40pm, until 25 August There\u2019s lots to love about this show from the Wardrobe Ensemble, creators of Education, Education, Education. It\u2019s in the way the four sisters (surname Pelican) represent their late mother in identical red dresses and take turns to maintain her haunting presence. It\u2019s in the bursts of unexpected choreography to the beat of Grace Jones and in the fluid company spirit. It veers from one polished and fizzy scene to the next, delighting with a dance, a comedic exchange or an inventive twist, but never quite declares its purpose. MF Read the review Joz Norris Is Dead. Long Live Mr Fruit Salad. Heroes @ The Hive, 4.40pm, until 25 August Is it absurdist comedy or a cry for help? The blurb describes Joz Norris\u2019s Mr Fruit Salad as \u201ca fictional chimera created as a form of self-care\u201d, but for most of the show, you\u2019d guess it was just a nonsense caper with Vic Reeves overtones. In sunhat, sunshades and a preposterous beard, Mr Fruit Salad barks out his Joan Rivers impersonation and sings a punning version of Chic\u2019s Le Freak. Gradually, a bass note of melancholy sounds louder in the mix, as Norris starts riffing on bereavement and existential angst. There\u2019s a fantastic old-school sight gag too, in a show that increasingly brings to mind the crap-disguise-and-melancholy combo that John Kearns has made his own. BL The Chosen Dance Base, 5pm, until 25 August The weighty issue of mortality informs Kally Lloyd-Jones\u2019s latest work. An hour-long piece with six dancers in everyday clothes and trainers, it earnestly attempts to confront the incomprehensible certainty of non-existence. Dance is so often about youth, but Lloyd-Jones offers some thought-provokingly mature alternatives. In one particularly effective sequence, a single dancer prepares, with jittery intensity, for a series of balances and turns, each time crashing to the floor. It evokes not only the brevity of a dancer\u2019s onstage life, but also something broader about futility, achievement and carrying on regardless. AW Read the review Daniel Kitson Stand Comedy Club, 5pm, until 25 August He makes his entrance singing \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about this show at all\u201d, and delivers an hour of non sequiturs, half-formed thoughts and quarter-baked routines. It\u2019s funny \u2013 when is he not? \u2013 even as it made me pine for a good old-fashioned Kitson standup show, for a difference split between his two modes of over-involved and under-rehearsed. Who knows when \u2013 or whether \u2013 we\u2019ll get it? But it\u2019s a pleasure to be entertained by a brand of humour that \u2013 in the subjects it addresses; in the quality of Kitson\u2019s thought \u2013 is unlike anyone else\u2019s. BL Read the review Scream Phone Gilded Balloon Patter Hoose, 5pm, until 26 August All-female trio Swipe Right infuse new blood into the fringe parody musical with this show, in which a sleepover of three teenage girls (the Beaver Babes) quickly turns sinister. There\u2019s a lot of fun with the archetypes of teen cinema \u2013 the geek, the sex-mad airhead and the bitchy ringleader; the songs are repurposed versions of 80s hits, belted out in genuinely impressive three-part harmonies; and the object of their crush is a man plucked from the audience (to toe-curling effect if, like me, you\u2019re the audience member in question). Then the phone rings, and things turn get (a bit) darker. It might not be very scary, but Scream Phone is spiky, spunky and smart. AN Four Woke Baes Underbelly Cowgate, 5.05pm, until 25 August With three friends, Des is toasting his imminent marriage. Enter Emma: a gorgeous, intellectual writer on sex and free love, camping alone in the woods and now obliged to share riverside space with Des and his bros. She\u2019s a spur to debate \u2013 about the compromises we make in monogamous partnerships; about the relationship between love and sex. Her radical honesty picks apart the little lies that bind their band together. Moment to moment, Teddy Bergman\u2019s production is a pleasure to watch, powering up a palpable sexual and ideological charge. BL Read the review Parakeet Roundabout @ Summerhall, 5.05pm, until 25 August Planting saplings has been proposed as part of a DIY solution to the climate crisis, for those of us who can\u2019t approve legislation. So what direct action can be taken when councils lop down precious trees? That\u2019s one of the questions posed by this eco-musical of small scale but with moments of mighty power. It\u2019s colourful in its approach to complex material, asking how theatre can play a role in sustainability. And, in a show fizzing with youth, one other question stands out: if 16-year-olds can legally become company directors and have sex, why on earth can\u2019t they vote? CW Read the review Superstar Underbelly Cowgate, 5.30pm, until 25 August The Edinburgh fringe is good at bringing forth harrowing personal stories, moving testimonies of overcoming obstacles, surviving illness, abuse and addiction. Safe to say, the list of harrowing subject matter doesn\u2019t usually include growing up as the youngest of five siblings in a comfortable middle-class home. That one of those siblings is Chris Martin of Coldplay might add to the intrigue but little alters the stakes. The show\u2019s saving grace is its considerable charm. Wren is an easy actor to like and she makes you feel her minor-league demon is worth wrestling with. Taking the advice to write what you know, she tells her not-really-showbiz story of childhood pantos and movie bit parts as a way of coming to terms with herself. MF Read the review Stand Up with Janine Harouni (Please Remain Seated) Pleasance Courtyard, 5.45pm, until 25 August The Lebanese-American comic\u2019s dilemma is that her dad voted for Donald Trump. Her show sets out to resolve it. By the end of a set conspicuously constructed for emotional catharsis, she\u2019s done so \u2013 even if it requires a sleight of hand you barely notice till you\u2019re halfway home. Harouni pulls off with supreme smoothness and control an autobiographical hour on her Staten Island upbringing and on the road accident that almost paralysed her for life. BL Read the review Sarah Keyworth: Pacific Pleasance Courtyard, 5.45pm, until 25 August Sarah Keyworth\u2019s 2018 fringe show \u2013 which secured her a best newcomer nomination \u2013 fretted at the signification of the words \u201cboy\u201d and \u201cgirl\u201d. A big subject, and one she clearly hasn\u2019t exhausted, given that its follow-up, Pacific, harps on the same string. But from a new angle: this one draws on her relationship with fellow standup Catherine Bohart, in which Keyworth finds herself defaulting to the traditional male role. Or failing to do so, which frustrates her \u2013 and she\u2019s not sure why. BL Read the review Daddy Drag Summerhall, 5.45pm, until 25 August Dressed in drag as a bearded, beer-bellied father, Leyla Josephine dad-raps and teases audience members. This everydad is silly, laddish and affectionate, a manchild who\u2019s used to being the \u201cfun\u201d parent, free of responsibilities \u2013 the manifestation of society\u2019s expectations of fatherhood. As the show goes on, it becomes clear that this both is and isn\u2019t Josephine\u2019s own, larger-than-life father. Because stereotypes can\u2019t contain a person. Gradually, uncomfortable facts spill out and erode the crumbling facade of the character Josephine has created. The costume is dismantled as the truth starts to emerge. CL Read the review Crystal Rasmussen Underbelly Cowgate, 5.50pm, until 25 August Crystal Rasmussen of the drag queen supergroup Denim turns their memoir into a fringe show. It charts the life stories of Crystal \u2013 a Romanov who fled the Bolsheviks to be raised by wolves \u2013 and their alter ego Tom, a gender nonconforming boy in Lancashire. They meet; they help one another; they become one \u2013 with costume changes and powerpop cover versions en route. The twin-track narrative is a nice conceit, and it\u2019s thrilling when they come together. The glamorous aspirations sometimes chafe against the lo-fi staging, and Rasmussen writhing semi-nude in a paddling pool brings little to the party. But they\u2019ve got charisma by the bucketful, and a falsetto that slices to the heart. BL Read the review Dispatches on the Red Dress Scottish Storytelling Centre, 6pm, until 26 August Rowan Rheingans\u2019s sublime play is set in Bretzenheim, the German municipality where the musician\u2019s grandparents still live. Performing with transfixing economy, Rheingans appears to be weaving a romantic tale of sweet-natured relatives and idyllic childhood memories, but stitched into her narrative is a darker strand. It takes only a short walk from her grandparents\u2019 home to see the \u201cfield of misery\u201d, the location of an Allied camp for \u201cdisarmed enemy forces\u201d at the end of the second world war. Co-written by Liam Hurley, this is a show that celebrates family and nature and packs a fierce political punch. MF Read the review Will Adamsdale: FaceTime Underbelly Bristo Square, 6pm, until 25 August FaceTime is perhaps Adamsdale\u2019s most straightforward standup show to date. He tells us about life as a husband and parent, how he\u2019s unsociable, bad at DIY, and lacks focus and drive since his 2004 fringe breakthrough. So far, so normal. But Adamsdale will never do a normal show, and FaceTime demonstrates what a skilled operator he is. Frame by frame, the show homes in on his relationship with his three-year-old son, Stan, then his wife\u2019s affair with Netflix. What starts as domestic standup ends up being more like a Roald Dahl short story. PF Read the review Snare Pleasance Courtyard, 6pm, until 26 August It\u2019s been a while since Charlie Chuck saw the potential of drums in standup comedy, so perhaps there\u2019s a gap in the market for comedian Alexander Fox (\u201cslave to the rhythm, intern to the boogie\u201d). But there\u2019s little of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll animal in the smartly dressed 26-year-old, whose field of reference is more classical history than classic rock. Oddly, in Snare he gets almost no comic mileage from the drums themselves. The comedy comes when he leaves the drum stool to tell an almost certainly fictional tale of his seduction by a drum teacher, a story he embellishes with prerecorded voiceovers and a keen ear for a gag. It sounds odd on paper, but he makes a pleasingly offbeat hour of it. MF Read the review Tom Parry: Parryoke! Pleasance Courtyard, 6pm, until 26 August That title, \u201cParryoke!\u201d: the pun, the exclamation mark, the nod to karaoke. I went into Parry\u2019s show fearing enforced audience participation but I should have trusted him more. Parryoke! is a tribute to \u2013 and a dissection of \u2013 weddings, especially the speeches. He charts his journey from being someone who went to more music festivals than weddings, to the complete opposite, from guzzling drugs to guzzling canapes. Earlier this year he got hitched himself. There is a Peter Kay-ish feel to it all, but the comfiness mustn\u2019t deflect from his comic instincts. There are no duff routines \u2013 everything is there for a reason. Parryoke! is all smiles. And you don\u2019t have to sing a note. PF Read the review Evening shows Who Cares Summerhall, 6.20pm, until 25 August Brutal but beautifully done, this emotionally raw and theatrically slick verbatim play lays blame on austerity for the agony and overwhelming loneliness young carers are exposed to. It is heartbreaking at every turn. Detailing how easy it is for young carers to slip through the net, Who Cares paints a picture of our government going round with scissors and cutting bigger gaps for them to fall through. Young carers deserve attention, money and recognition. Supporting this humane tear-jerker of a play is a start. KW Read the review Civilisation Underbelly Cowgate, 6.25pm, until 25 August Complex, raw and insensibly smart, Civilisation is a charged study of the absurdity of grief and intrusion. Quietly audacious in form and timing, this strange and beautiful piece produced by Antler refuses to abide by the normal rules of storytelling. A young woman returns from her partner\u2019s funeral and performs ordinary actions in the nonsensical way you do when no one\u2019s watching. She character is oblivious to the three dancers who invade her space. They move wildly to music we hear only some of the time; the moments of silence are like held breath. We don\u2019t fully understand the link between the two worlds, but the strange symbiosis of dramatic realism and contemporary dance creates an intimate, alien portrait of loss and isolation. I could watch for ever. KW Read the review Tom Rosenthal: Manhood Pleasance Courtyard, 6.30pm, until 25 August Dick jokes are as old as comedy, but there are few dedicate shows on the subject. Step forward Tom Rosenthal with an hour-long diatribe about his own diminished equipment. Rosenthal was circumcised as an infant, a gratuitous and abusive act as far as he\u2019s concerned \u2013 and he\u2019s got the research to back that victim complex up. The show packs a rhetorical punch and has laughs, too. Rosenthal takes a risk getting so het up on the subject, , but het up he gets, leaving the conceit of the redundant foreskin in shreds. Not everyone shares his views and he takes care to attack circumcision itself, not the cultures that practise it. And as Rosenthal admits, the polemic can overshadow the comedy, , but it\u2019s a striking show, raising questions and laughter in equal measure. BL Read the review Pops Assembly Roxy, 6.35pm, until 25 August In Charlotte Josephine\u2019s play, the real drama lives and breathes in what\u2019s not said. Josephine and director Ali Pidsley are unafraid of silence, painting as much with pauses as with words and shaking off the baggage of familiar, sensational depictions of what addiction does to families. Josephine refuses to even voice the word \u201caddiction\u201d \u2013 the slowly accreting power of this suffocating silence and repetition feels more truthful than the sobbing and hair-tearing more common to portraits of substance abuse. Tiny twitches, glances and strained smiles say more about their relationship than any volume of words could. CL Read the review Toyko Rose Underbelly, 6.55pm, until 25 August While it would be overselling this show to call it Hamilton meets Angels in America, it has the hip-hop firepower of the former and, like the latter, it explores the state\u2019s injustice to its outsiders \u2013 especially when they\u2019re accused of treason. Performed by an all-female cast, Tokyo Rose tells the story of Iva d\u2019Aquino, a Japanese American woman charged with broadcasting propaganda during world war two in order to demoralise Allied troops. With smart retro visuals and songs that snap like a GI\u2019s chewing gum, this tells a complex story with admirable economy and shines a light on a particularly murky corner of American history. AN Ivo Graham: The Game of Life Pleasance Courtyard, 7pm, until 25 August The only thing holding Ivo Graham back in previous shows was his own, well, restraint. The old Etonian (he never fails to mention it)has always been a fine joke writer and constructor of routines, with an identifiable, if familiar, persona \u2013 that of the Hugh Grant-alike awkward toff, dressing up his enfeeblement in decorous gentility. Graham just needed to let rip a bit \u2013 and he does so here (if only a bit), with a bigger-hitting set on new parenthood. BL Read the review Kai Samra: Underclass Pleasance Courtyard, 7pm, until 25 August How do you prosper in a world rigged against you from the start? That\u2019s one theme in this autobiographical hour, which conjures with race and class as it recounts Samra\u2019s West Midlands upbringing with his brother and single mum. In the telling, there\u2019s nothing grim about this: Samra wears his social commentary lightly in an arresting debut show that takes him to thoughtful conclusions about how he fits in, about comedy, revolution and self-acceptance. BL Read the review Yuriko Kotani: Somosomo Pleasance Courtyard, 7pm, until 26 August \u201cFor me, this is paradise,\u201d says Yuriko Kotani. She loves doing standup, in the teeth of everyone\u2019s expectations that it was beyond her. The man who said her English wasn\u2019t good enough; the charmer who told her \u201cGo back to where you came from\u201d; and the culture in her native Japan that rewards conformism and censures attention-seeking. Kotani is still demure of demeanour \u2013 it\u2019s part of the joke \u2013 as she traces her journey to this likable fringe debut. The show is oddly structured: there\u2019s a heart-on-sleeve climax forty minutes in. But there\u2019s also pert intercultural comedy as Kotani becomes \u201cBritishnised\u201d, and some slyly spiky feminism, while her glee at deploying the puns and sarcasm native to her adopted country is infectious. BL Sophie Duker: Venus Pleasance Courtyard, 7pm, until 24 August Duker is a fast-rising standup who runs the Wacky Racists club night, and her full fringe debut is adroitly pitched somewhere between autobiographical calling-card and show with a big-hitting theme. We meet the pansexual comic with daddy issues and a lack of brown-skinned role models. And we learn how black people are used as props in white narratives \u2013 not least, the 19th-century freakshow celebrity and so-called \u201cHottentot Venus\u201d, Sara Baartman, who gives the show its title. It\u2019s a confident and likable hour. BL Read the review Sex Education Summerhall, Techcube, 7.10pm, until 25 August Most of us have lacklustre sex education in school and are left to figure it out through trial, error and, potentially, trauma. Harry Clayton-Wright\u2019s barnstormingly sex-positive Sex Education attempts to rid the stage of shame \u2013 unless that\u2019s what you\u2019re into \u2013 as he intersperses delicate, difficult conversations he has recorded with his mum, with clips of gay porn his dad gave him when he was 14. He is a mischievous storyteller in a diamond-studded wedding dress, and this is an achingly funny, filthy and tender confessional. But his funny and surprisingly open mum is the real star. KW Read the review Oh Yes Oh No Summerhall, Cairns Lecture theatre, 7.20pm, until 25 August Tracing a line between sexy and sickening, Louise Orwin\u2019s show serves as a reminder of how sex puts us at our most vulnerable. It is in one moment empowering and exhilarating, and in the next, full of rage and despair. At the show\u2019s dark heart, it asks the thorny question of why and how some rape survivors have rape fantasies? However smartly manipulative Orwin is in the construction of her show, she is delicate with women\u2019s recorded words: probing and questioning, but never judging. This is not an easy show to watch, but one that dives deep into grey areas many others are afraid to explore. KW Read the review Jack Rooke: Love Letters Assembly George Square Gardens, 7.30pm, until 24 August Set to a live harp, Love Letters places platonic love up high alongside the romantic kind. Rooke is an epically intimate storyteller; even if we don\u2019t have long, it is a pleasure to spend time with him. Though tinged with sadness and shame, Love Letters is a buoyant comedy about pleasure. With dangling fairy lights and falling roses, the comedian and self-confessed \u201crecovering spoken-word artist\u201d gives friendships and sibling relationships the romantic treatment that is usually reserved for sexual ones. KW Read the review The Afflicted Summerhall, 7.30pm, until 25 August In 2012, an industrial New York town was hit by an epidemic of inexplicable twitching among a group of schoolgirls. Was it pollution, mass hysteria, demonic possession or female teenage angst? Over an hour, we investigate the story through a podcast-style voiceover, contextual and atmospheric film, media reports from the time \u2013 and most of all, through the dance and physical theatre of four young female performers, playing the girls who couldn\u2019t be cured, and who then disappeared. Leaning equally on This American Life and Arthur Miller\u2019s The Crucible, but with a subversive impact all its own, this is a darkly elusive hour of theatre with an aftertaste. AN The Wild Unfeeling World Pleasance Courtyard, 7.30pm, until 25 August A bite-sized, one-woman version of Moby-Dick, told in part with animal figurines? All it would need to be a bigger fringe cliche is a few musical numbers. But this buoyant solo show, reimagining Melville\u2019s epic as a young woman\u2019s nocturnal journey from Hounslow to the South Bank, isn\u2019t as twee as it sounds \u2013 even if Ahab has become a three-legged ginger cat. The story\u2019s real quest is not for the great white whale but for joy and calm in a chaotic world. It comes with a full-hearted performance from our host \u2013 call her not Ishmael but Casey Jane Andrews. She bewitches an audience of 20, huddled around lantern-like lights, in a performance that will sweep you away. CW John Robins: Hot Shame Pleasance Courtyard, 7.30pm, until 25 August Robins\u2019 fall-guy shtick mustn\u2019t obscure that he is a top dog at standup. Hot Shame is the title of a book he displays stage right, mordant readings from which punctuate the hour. Each story details a mortifying incident in our host\u2019s life \u2013 such as the time he cancelled a gig because he was addicted to online golf, or when, aged 15, he mistook flirting for saying the word \u201cknickers\u201d over and over. It is a masterclass in tempo, tone and character, as apoplexy ebbs to stunned disbelief, before terminating in Robins\u2019 wordless horror at how badly he\u2019s failed at home improvement. Another winning show from a man who can\u2019t stop losing for our entertainment. BL Read the review Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr: Bossy Bottom Monkey Barrel Comedy, 7.30pm, until 25 August No gimmicks, promises the absurdo-feminist comic at the start of Bossy Bottom, her first standup show as \u201cherself\u201d for seven years. Suffice to say, the embargo lasts about a minute and a half, in a show that delights in upending expectations and scrambling modes of comedic presentation. It\u2019s an enjoyably dizzying experience, with strong material on her queer feminism \u2013 her confusion at the connection straight people make between sex and babies, her inability to tell white men apart. It\u2019s pleasingly outrageous stuff, delivered with the kind of stare that says: I\u2019m just kidding \u2013 or am I? BL Read the review Phil Wang: Philly Philly Wang Wang Pleasance Courtyard, 8pm, until 25 August Wang is back with a new no-messing, harder-nosed attitude, along with excellent jokes including some choice one-liners. The new show \u2013 his first since 2017\u2019s terrific Kinabalu \u2013 is high-end standup with excellent jokes, new perspectives and a distinctive persona. It\u2019s very easy to admire, albeit a little harder to love than his previous offerings. I liked it a lot, and may even have loved it were it not for a slight cynicism (ironic or otherwise) that has crept into Wang\u2019s demeanour. He\u2019s not quite the lovable fellow of previous shows, but Philly Philly Wang Wang remains a strong offering, and very few of those early-bird bookers will leave disappointed. BL Read the review Lucy McCormick: Post Popular Pleasance Courtyard, 8pm, until 25 August Utterly indelicate and completely unpredictable, Post Popular is a wild ride. Lucy McCormick\u2019s ludicrous performance-lecture-cum-cabaret-cum-rage-room is built with so many layers of irony and mockery that its core would be rotten by the time you dug down to it. If only more history lessons were like this. This singalong search for a hero is a sabre-toothed comedy about women\u2019s place in the limelight. Armed with acerbic wit, an extraordinary poker face and a bag of interval snacks, she takes us through a highly participatory alternative history of the greatest hits of womankind. KW Read the review Traumboy Summerhall, 8.10pm, until 25 August \u201cI\u2019m not the person most people think I am,\u201d says Daniel Hellmann in Traumboy, part of the Swiss Selection Edinburgh. That\u2019s partly because, when he\u2019s not working as a performance artist, he earns a living as a prostitute. Coming out as gay in his late teens was one thing; admitting to being a sex worker is another \u2013 although, now that he\u2019s made a show about it, the secret is out. Traumboy is as much about identity and appearances as about a misunderstood occupation. It\u2019s one of four autofictional shows brought together on the fringe as Swiss Selection Edinburgh. MF Read the review. Huge Davies: The Carpark Pleasance Courtyard, 8.15pm, until 25 August The brand of musical comedy \u2013 where the music rather than the lyrics supplies the funny \u2013 recalls Bill Bailey. The delivery is more Jack Dee. The comedian is Huge Davies, strapped to a floating keyboard, delivering deadpan jokes about Daft Punk and the way the movies soundtrack gladiators\u2019 deaths. It\u2019s very funny. Davies bosses us about schoolmaster-style, takes apart the lyrics to Busted songs and fails to perform his autobiographical musical about child abduction in a carpark. One or two gags are over-explained, and it gets a bit scrappy towards the end. But it\u2019s an arresting debut from this offbeat authoritarian. BL London Hughes: To Catch a Dick Pleasance Courtyard, 8.15pm, until 25 August London Hughes is a force of nature, a rampaging ego with the personality to fill the Pleasance Attic several times over. So why is she still single? That\u2019s the question posed by this raucous 30-year-old\u2019s sexual and romantic history. One man in the audience is grilled about his sex life and obliged to mime oral sex on stage. Hughes\u2019 show rejoices in flouting whatever proprieties are left around female sexuality. This is a woman who loves sex, loves glamour, loves herself and wants the world to know it. If this roof-raising performance is anything to go by, they soon will. BL Read the review Josie Long: Tender Stand Comedy Club, 8.20pm, until 25 August Long\u2019s new show makes you realise how seldom pregnancy and childbirth are given this attention on the comedy stage. She takes us through the ride from choosing a name to applying for \u201cBaby on board\u201d badges to her improbable analogy for the pain of contractions: childbirth is \u201clike a cross between MDMA \u2026 and death\u201d. In the closing stages she weighs up how to be hopeful for your kids at a time of climate crisis. For a show made under the shadow of the apocalypse, it is full of love and defiant joy. BL Read the review Sara Barron: Enemies Closer Pleasance Courtyard Upstairs, 8.30pm, until 25 August US standup Sara Barron\u2019s new show couldn\u2019t be brassier, sassier or louder-mouthed if it tried. Parading her sex life, friendships and militant subjectivity across the stage, Enemies Closer is a leap forward from her best newcomer-nominated debut, and also sends up the black-and-white nature of modern judgment. It is a step into the big league for this gleefully profane comic, that revels in (and obliquely satirises) the kneejerk judgmentalism once practised behind people\u2019s backs, and now practised everywhere. BL Read the review Hearty Summerhall, 9.10pm, until 24 August With an injured tail and wings made of knives, Emma Frankland is our guide in the apocalypse. The trans artist hunts for safety in a burning world where trans bodies are policed, activism is commercialised and violence is fuelled by fear. She sharpens the knives protruding from her shoulder blades and builds herself a den to protect herself from the violence outside. Hearty, both furious and vulnerable, pays tribute to the trans artists who have paved the way for work as bold as this, and lays the ground for those that will follow. KW Read the review Micky Overman Presents: Presenting Miss Micky Overman Pleasance Courtyard, 9.15pm, until 25 August If you\u2019re non-British, do you have to make comedy about your non-Britishness? Micky Overman starts her show with a tease, withholding where she comes from while delivering non-identity-specific standup on childhood and body image. Then she relents; the rest of her show ribs the very idea of national comedy. There\u2019s a routine on British sexual innuendo (\u201cWhat a fun riddle!\u201d), and an invitation to listen to standup in her native language. Her origins, though, have nothing to do with a show that gently interrogates friendship and romance, and Overman\u2019s feeling of being co-opted into other people\u2019s stories. Charismatic, frank and just a little dotty (though far less than she seems to think), she stakes a confident claim to the starring role in her own. BL Camille O\u2019Sullivan Sings Cave Pleasance Courtyard, 9.15pm, until 25 August \u201cI don\u2019t like him either,\u201d Camille O\u2019Sullivan whispers to the front row in mock horror. She has just wrapped up a raucous run through Stagger Lee, alternately tickled and thrilled by our hero\u2019s bloodthirsty odyssey. O\u2019Sullivan may not like Lee but she loves Nick Cave and the prospect of a whole covers show will delight anyone who has ever been sent back into the night singing her set-closing version of The Ship Song. Here, she delivers an eerily weary Mercy Seat, loosens up the macabre Red Right Hand and makes even the most fleeting characters in his tales come alive. The result is an evening that veers from lullaby to prayer to howl, with O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s voice as breathtaking as ever, like a star exploding in the sky. CW Jordan Brookes: I\u2019ve Got Nothing Pleasance Courtyard, 9.10pm, until 25 August The conceit of I\u2019ve Got Nothing is that Jordan Brookes is winging this encounter with an audience. He cuts to the big issues (his self-loathing, our hunger for connection, the imminent end of the world) and addresses them seemingly without guile. In between, he drops non-sequitur gags which may be a key to something more significant. None of this plays by comedy\u2019s usual rules. It\u2019s always gripping, and he pulls the rug out from under our expectations of how standup shows end, and tearing that rug to shreds. One of the comic coups of this year\u2019s fringe. BL Read the review Demi Lardner: Ditch Witch 800 Gilded Balloon Teviot, 9.15pm, until 26 August You never know what\u2019s coming next in Ditch Witch 800, a fizzing 50 minutes of sketches, doodles, one-liners, daft dances and out-of-nowhere jingles. One oddity tumbles on top of another, each animated with hyperactive thrust by Demi Lardner \u2013 and underpinned by fine writing. The show doesn\u2019t surmount the biggest challenge for this type of work: it\u2019s only ever a series of unrelated moments that doesn\u2019t build momentum and ends arbitrarily. But among those moments are some of the funniest on the fringe. Lardner has a confidence and explosive vitality all of her own. BL Read the review Jack Tucker: Comedy Stand-Up Hour Underbelly, Cowgate, 9.20pm, until 25 August The hack comic is such a mainstay of drama and caricature, the concept is practically hack itself. You need something to distinguish yourself from the herd, and Zach Zucker (of clown duo Zach and Viggo) certainly has with this new show in character as a washed-up American standup, Jack Tucker. The something in question is director and sound-effects operator Jonny Woolley, effectively the other half of an on stage/off stage double act. Way beyond the boom-tish you might expect, there is a range of sounds and samples tailored to Tucker\u2019s every comment, punchline and flirtatious wink. BL Read the review Moon: We Cannot Get Out Pleasance Courtyard, 9.30pm, until 25 August Jack Chisnall and Joshua Dolphin\u2019s \u201cbleak, provincial\u201d sketches add up to a terrific show. Their style is oddly combative, as if they\u2019re performing in a boxing ring. The thread running through the show is that the venue is out to get them, snagging them on hooks and throttling them with the mic lead. The sketches themselves are frequently a delight, often riffing on TV tropes: they have a brainbox detective who stuffs up bad, a Monopoly debt enforcer and a rail operator who thinks he\u2019s stuck in the world of Thomas the Tank Engine. There are unpredictable reveals and a few smartypants manoeuvres. As a sketch duo, they\u2019re the full package. PF Read the review Simon Brodkin: 100% Simon Brodkin Pleasance Courtyard, 9.30pm, until 24 August This is a big gig for Simon Brodkin, his first as \u201chimself\u201d rather than as cockney cheeky chappy Lee Nelson. We get a behind-the-scenes look at the occasion of his bombarding Donald Trump with Nazi golf balls. But the most striking section addresses Brodkin\u2019s Judaism, and the history \u2013 and revival \u2013 of antisemitism. It\u2019s done with a light touch but he doesn\u2019t soft-soap his hurt at the Labour party\u2019s current travails, nor the difficulty of explaining anti-Jewish hatred to his children. BL Read the review Jayde Adams: The Ballad of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Old Face Pleasance Courtyard, 9.30pm, until 25 August Jayde Adams doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s being taken seriously enough as a comedian, so has been boning up on feminism. The Ballad of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Old Face \u2013 good title \u2013 is certainly a departure from her previous work, if not the great leap forward some have perceived. Adams pours cold water on the progressive claims made for pop culture icons, arguing they conceal the more radical work being done elsewhere. Perhaps \u2013 just perhaps \u2013 Jay-Z grabbing his wife\u2019s backside onstage isn\u2019t really advancing the gender equality cause. BL Read the review Schalk Bezuidenhout: South African White Boy Pleasance Courtyard, 9.30pm, until 26 August Ten years ago, Trevor Noah made his Edinburgh festival debut \u2013 and he\u2019s not done badly since. Fellow South African Schalk Bezuidenhout was once his support act, and is now pitching for an international profile of his own. On the basis of this endearing first fringe outing, you wouldn\u2019t bet against him. It\u2019s gentle rather than uproarious, but Bezuidenhout has a scampish spirit and a winning way with a crowd, and his autobiographical tales of teenage life in \u201cthe friend zone\u201d, or of singing black African songs in a predominantly Afrikaans school choir, or the time a fan asked him to assist with a marriage proposal, add up to an hour of buoyant fun. BL Musik Assembly Rooms, 9.40pm, until 24 August Frances Barber stars as a fictional pop icon Billie Trix in this one-woman spinoff from the 2001 musical Closer to Heaven. As she says herself, she\u2019s a \u201czeitgeist for sore eyes\u201d and, just as she captured the disco market with the Sister Sledge-like pulse of Ich Bin Music, so she caught the eye of the YBA scene when she hung out with Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin in the 90s. She has been courted by everyone from Dal\u00ed to Trump, and no less a figure than Jean-Paul Sartre called her pretentious. Time and again, she has proved the naysayers wrong and has had the power not only to reinvent herself, but to bring peace where there is conflict. We laugh \u2013 a lot \u2013 in support of her resilience. MF Read the review Courtney Pauroso: Gutterplum Underbelly Cowgate, 9.40pm, until 25 August This is a show you won\u2019t easily forget, particularly if you\u2019re selected as her stooge. Gutterplum introduces us to Dale Ravioli, a gawky tomboy showing us what she can do with an exercise ball. A punter is summoned to join in \u2013 and thus begins an hour-long/lifelong relationship leading us from smouldering sex, via loneliness and the rekindling of love, all the way to old age and death. Whether she\u2019s doing sexy pushups, miming a drive to the abortion clinic, or playing air guitar on a pubic wig \u2013 it never stops being ridiculous. BL Read the review Goodbear: Dougal Pleasance Dome, 9.40pm, until 25 August The audience are assembled, but sketch duo Goodbear haven\u2019t shown up. So what\u2019s a duty manager to do? Kill time, of course \u2013 which front-of-house boss Joe and underling Henry proceed to do. One thing leads to another and Joe and Henry (AKA Joe Barnes and Henry Perryment) start competing for the spotlight. Who needs Goodbear? It\u2019s a winning conceit for a sketch show, as comic scenarios alternate with the here-and-now of the venue staff turned accidental comics, covering for the absent pros. Some fine scenes emerge from and scramble the show\u2019s multiple realities, and they all spin out of one another with impressive fluidity. It\u2019s a smart show: these front-of-house boys should be given their own show forthwith. BL Read the review Before the Revolution Summerhall, 9.50pm, until 25 August What causes a people to rise up? Is it a simple trigger or a complex web of reasons? News reports prefer an easy cause-and-effect narrative; the reality is less straightforward. That\u2019s the thinking behind Ahmed El Attar\u2019s bruising two-hander, a theatrical collage that gives an impressionistic account of the driving forces behind Egypt\u2019s revolution of 2011. He uses a striking visual metaphor: dressed in white, two actors stand stock still for the play\u2019s 40 minutes, staring straight ahead with a look somewhere between caution and terror. They are well advised to be alarmed; around their feet is a bed of nails. Charlie Astr\u00f6m\u2019s lighting glows bright then brighter still, while exacerbating their discomfort is Hassan Khan\u2019s punishing score, a percussive barrage of beats and blips. MF Read the review Tarot Pleasance Courtyard, 10.45pm, until 25 August We wanted to make a show, the Tarot trio tell us, in the true spirit of the fringe. If that means a left-field idea pursued in the name of fun and in defiance of good sense \u2026 well, they\u2019ve succeeded flamboyantly with this occult-meets-cult hour. The jokes come out of nowhere, are bark-out-loud funny, and the whole hour is startlingly live. There\u2019s a sense throughout that the trio are committed to keeping proceedings as surprising as possible. It\u2019s fun for them \u2013 I could see director Kiri Pritchard-McLean laughing uproariously in the wings \u2013 and a hoot for us, too. BL Read the review Jamie Loftus: Boss, Whom is Girl Pleasance Courtyard, 10.45pm, until 26 August Is it feminist to demand more women in corporate leadership roles? Not necessarily, as many a reader of Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s Lean In concluded \u2013 US comic Jamie Loftus among them. Loftus\u2019s late-night show Boss, Whom Is Girl sends up feminism a la Sandberg, which invites women to beat macho male fat cats at their own game. She presents herself as Shell Gasoline-Sandwich, founder of surveillance tech firm Pee-Pee Smarthomes. This seminar for wannabe \u201cgirl bosses\u201d \u2013 subject to the gradual subversion of Shell\u2019s digi-slave Patricia \u2013 is in need of direction but winningly oddball, and enjoyably alert to the limits of empowerment Silicon Valley-style. BL Catherine Cohen: The Twist...? She\u2019s Gorgeous Pleasance Courtyard, 10.45pm, until 24 August Cohen\u2019s personality hits you like a hurricane as she burlesques the tension between the carefully curated wonderfulness demanded of her tribe, and the rampant anxiety it strives to conceal. The songs are the anchor, and they crackle with attitude. Scansion and rhyme are secondary: Cohen\u2019s lyrical scheme is never too strict for a self-adoring aside or stream-of-consciousness tirade. It helps that her voice is a terrific musical \u2013 and comic \u2013 instrument, her words dilating at will into nonsense vocal stylings. A sense of silly is high in the mix. BL Read the review Diane Chorley: Down the Flick Assembly, 11pm, until 25 August The drinks might not be free, but the show Down the Flick is as 80s as Club Tropicana. Pass the pink neon sign and you descend into a palm tree-adorned wonderland, presided over by the lurex-clad Duchess of Canvey, Diane Chorley, who\u2019s got songs, languid patter \u2026 and some seriously transgressive acts. The Guardian\u2019s night in the Flick culminated in the sight of two people pulling chocolates out of their nether regions, before Chorley got the night more or less back on track with a performance of George Michael\u2019s Freedom! 90. It\u2019s a hoot \u2013 but think twice about sitting in the front row. AN Tricky Second Album Pleasance Dome, 11pm, until 18 August At once a love letter and a massive screw-you to theatre, this punk-rock manifesto is not a play for the faint of heart. KLF\u2019s infamous stunt of burning a million pounds is used as a springboard for a ferocious takedown of our capitalist consumer culture where the elite, with money to burn, set the rules of engagement. Though the theatre-makers\u2019 anger ricochets deeper into our society, their specific target is the Edinburgh fringe, of which their show is a part, and its exorbitant cost for performers. There is a terrifying, electric sense that anything could happen next. KW Read the review Spank! Underbelly Cowgate, 11.55pm, until 25 August Spank! is an Edinburgh institution; a rowdy late-night comedy club which starts at midnight and can go until 3am. Presided over by comperes James Loveridge and Evan Desmarais, who expertly rip the piss out of most of the audience without seeming remotely obnoxious, it\u2019s also a lucky dip of fringe comedians, around six of whom perform each night. On the night I went, there was a filthy set about art and masturbation from Grace Campbell, daughter of Alastair; some great jokes about deafness, cricket and Islam from emerging comic Eshaan Akbar; and a charming \u2013 and yes, funny \u2013 song about recycling by Jon Long. There\u2019s also a notorious regular slot where an audience member is invited to promote something \u2013 as long as they get completely naked first. The fact that this seems more celebratory than lecherous is a tribute to the warm and fuzzy feelings, admittedly aided by alcohol, that the Spank! team take care to create. AN Times vary Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran Traverse, until 25 August The sensation of racing a high-performance car along a swanky boulevard in Tehran is surely akin to watching this hi-tech, high-octane production by Javaad Alipoor and Kirsty Housley. With our phones open on Instagram as well as seeing images projected on stage, we\u2019re subjected to a fact-laden, multimedia collage \u2013 all hashtags, live feeds and rapid scrolling \u2013 almost overwhelming in its detail. MF Read the review Enough Traverse, until 25 August Stef Smith\u2019s latest play depicts a world trembling on the brink of change, but suggests women are ready to cast off their competitive singularity to become a collective force. It is one of those plays where patterned, poetic writing takes precedence over actual drama. Smith\u2019s two characters are female flight attendants. Often seen as stock farcical properties in plays like Boeing-Boeing, here they are long-term friends who offer soothing reassurance in the air but whose lives on the ground are unravelling. MB Read the review Crocodile Fever Traverse, until 25 August You\u2019ve seen plays set during the Troubles before, and this one, set over one night in a Catholic home in rural South Armagh, might easily have turned out to be just another domestic drama about life on the sectarian divide. Everything is in place: the devout sister, the returning gun runner, the paras on standby to raid any house on the slightest pretext. But where those pressures would normally produce a fraught drama with tragic leanings, here they lead to an explosive comedy. The actor turned playwright co-opts Tarantinoesque violence and magical-realist fantasy for ferociously feminist ends. MF Read the review How Not to Drown Traverse, until 25 August Dritan Kastrati has an extraordinary story to tell. As an 11-year-old Kosovan-Albanian refugee, he was entrusted by his father to people smugglers to make his way by boat, train and lorry across Europe. We know he survived because he and Nicola McCartney have fashioned a play out of his story in which he appears. But, while the piece is partly an adolescent adventure story, it also explores the dilemma of what it is like to be caught between two cultures, countries and languages. MB Read the review Burgerz Traverse, until 25 August Behind Travis Alabanza is a container full of cardboard boxes, each lined with pink tape. In front of them, a box to put a burger in. \u201cDo you feel boxed in?\u201d they ask. By the end of this humane and heart-rending show, they will have forced their way through the roof of the container \u2013 literally thinking outside the box. The impetus for the show was an incident in 2016 when an unknown assailant threw a burger at them in a transphobic attack. Much of it is very funny, but the angry and intelligent script is also underscored with the real pain of exclusion, of being trapped in a world where sexual and racial violence is prevalent and tolerated. MF Read the review Baby Reindeer Summerhall, until 25 August Richard Gadd\u2019s solo theatre debut recounts his horrifying experiences with a stalker. We never see Martha but we hear her voicemail messages and her emails scroll across the venue\u2019s ceiling and we\u2019re played testimonies from the saga\u2019s collaterally damaged: Gadd\u2019s parents, partner, landlady. What elevates the story is Gadd\u2019s initial complicity in the abuse. H presents himself as a disturbed soul, finding strange solace in Martha\u2019s attraction to him. A haunted, haunting hour. BL Read the review Ahir Shah: Dots Monkey Barrel Comedy, until 25 August The ardent polemicist of Shah\u2019s early work gives way to a more conflicted thinker, but the emphatic tones remain. He drifts towards his ancestral Hinduism, saying myths are more consoling than facts and \u201cbelief helps\u201d in his battle against depression. If that doesn\u2019t sound like a truckload of laughs, he finds both humour and poetry in his existential angst. There are no pat conclusions but there\u2019s a real ring of truth and hard-won humour in this portrait of an overthinker marooned between youth and adulthood, materialism and faith, between distant dying suns and holes in the floor of heaven. BL Read the review Arthur Your home, Edinburgh, until 25 August When the show stars a five-month-old boy, as it does in Daniel Bye\u2019s riveting two-hander, there is no predicting how all the sleeping, feeding and playing will pan out. Arthur has the added variant of being staged in your living room; performances are by request via the number in the fringe programme. Bye\u2019s theme is nature versus nurture and the way the exact same set of genes can produce very different looking plants, animals and human beings, according to the tiniest environmental variant. They build a funny and thoughtful show about the qualities we inherit and bequeath, the psychological effect we have on our children and the advantage such factors as class, health and wealth bestow. MF Read the review Daughterhood Summerhall, until 25 August The title of Charley Miles\u2019s play is somewhat misleading. Yes, its two female characters are each struggling with how best to be a daughter to their deteriorating father, but really Daughterhood is about what it means to be a sister. Miles sharply observes the complex, envy-laced relationship between siblings to forge a slender, tightly focused play whose nonlinear structure cleverly serves the material. Details are revealed at precisely the right moment, uncovering the reasons for long-buried resentment or flipping earlier assumptions on their heads. CL Read the review Until the Flood Traverse, until 25 August Dael Orlandersmith uses the 2014 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer as the catalyst for Until the Flood, which digs into the aftermath of the shooting and unearths ugly truths about race in the United States. The play is based on interviews with people in St Louis, but Orlandersmith has turned these real people into fictionalised composites. She transforms into her characters one by one and we get a glimpse of these people\u2019s lives, their struggles and dreams. CL Read the review Roots Church Hill theatre, until 25 August Drawn from the Aarne index, an archive of traditional tales in the British library, Roots bills itself as a \u201ccollection of folk jokes\u201d. There\u2019s the one about the cat that won\u2019t stop eating, the morality tale of the man who shares a house with Poverty, and the fable about an ogre who challenges a town to a laughing contest. Although unfamiliar, they have the recognisable tone of the fairy stories we grew up with. Lillian Henley\u2019s live score is performed on an oddball assortment of fiddles, saws and bass guitars, while Paul Barritt\u2019s animations allude to everything from children\u2019s picture books to 50s French fashion and 60s psychedelia. MF Read the review The Patient Gloria Traverse, until 25 August If you search online for Three Approaches to Psychotherapy, you\u2019ll find a set of 1965 recordings in which a patient, Gloria Szymanski, goes through sessions with three psychotherapists. By rights, you shouldn\u2019t be able to see them at all: the single mother was reportedly taken aback when they wound up in cinemas and even on television. For playwright Gina Moxley, the casual exploitation of a woman\u2019s private life is symptomatic of a society in which women exist to be framed, examined and exploited. She cross-dresses as the three psychotherapists, presenting them as smug egotists taking voyeuristic pleasure in their subject\u2019s revelations. MF Read the review 8:8 Summerhall, until 25 August This is a delicate, ephemeral and touching piece in which eight performers drawn from the Edinburgh community reveal something of themselves to an audience of eight. In a small room, they begin with a slow, almost motionless dance, showing different faces of themselves as they line up in horizontal and vertical arrangements. Eventually, the eight sit down in front of us and take turns giving true and false details about themselves. Then you put on headphones. The performer before you stares into your eyes while you listen to a recording of them talking. Behind the casual conversational remarks they made in public, you hear personal stories usually reserved for intimate acquaintances. It feels tender and intense. MF Read the review Sexy Lamp Pleasance Courtyard, until 26 August On the face of it, Katie Arnstein\u2019s smart solo show is an archetypal fringe piece: it has an autobiographical journey, with an overarching theme, and is told with pop-culture references, effervescent gags and plucky ukulele songs from a cheery host who we cheer on. But if the format is familiar, the telling is supremely assured. Sexy Lamp is full of sharp insights into the ways actors are exploited \u2013 groomed, even \u2013 by the machinations of an entire industry. Her trauma is raw and by the end, it\u2019s uncomfortably clear how much the #MeToo momentum must be maintained. CW Read the review Desiree Burch: Desiree\u2019s Coming Early! The Hive, until 25 August Desiree Burch is out of the traps at a gallop in her new show: the first 10 minutes all but pin you to the back of the auditorium. This is her story of a day at the Burning Man festival, a hallucinogenic odyssey in pursuit of sex, truth and \u2026 well, what exactly? Cutting away from her hair-raising tale of festival excess, Burch relates a brief history of IQ tests: how they were designed to support but later segregated the \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d, a category that in the US came with a heavy racial bias. Is there more matter crammed into this hour than many comics communicate in a decade? There is. BL Read the review Jessica Fostekew: Hench Monkey Barrel Comedy, until 25 August Who decides what\u2019s womanly? Culture, you might say, or the patriarchy. Or it maybe Jessica Fostekew, whose show Hench is delivered with the kind of welly that beefcakes reserve for the biggest punchbag in the gym. As she addresses her experience of being a muscular woman, rails at gender stereotyping and the dieting industry, and hurls her experience of giving birth at the crowd, it perhaps becomes more polemic than comedy. But it\u2019s a potent show about the policing of women\u2019s looks and strengths. BL Read the review Hear Word! Naija Woman Talk True Royal Lyceum, until 25 August Director Ifeoma Fafunwa\u2019s show is a collage of monologues and songs performed by a cast of 10 on the theme of women\u2019s rights. \u201cHear word\u201d is pidgin English for \u201clisten and comply\u201d, an ironic title for a performance dealing in resistance and defiance. Its short scenes relate true-life stories not just of child abuse, rape and sex trafficking but also of the more insidious ways women are kept in their place. This consciousness-raising is likely to be more necessary in a patriarchal Nigeria than in the UK, where fourth-wave feminism has its own set of concerns. That cultural difference makes the show less a source of political empowerment than a heartening vision of resistance and emancipation. It is at once tough and inspirational. MF Read the review Hard to Be Soft: A Belfast Prayer Lyceum, until 24 August Oona Doherty\u2019s dance show is about the sass, rage and resilience in a place where the conflict seems intractable and horizons are limited by constrictions of class and religion. It begins and ends with solos for Doherty, whose physical language is compellingly stark and subtle. It\u2019s movement that neither sanctifies nor sneers at machismo. Her form of physical prayer makes visible the violence and hidden vulnerability inherent in her community, while articulating emotional truths that exist across cultures. Sensitive yet unflinching, raw and richly choreographed, Doherty\u2019s dance is a major achievement. AW Read the review Darren Harriott: Good Heart Yute Pleasance Courtyard, until 25 August Darren Harriott is an introvert who struggles to express emotion and, aged 30, has never been in love. In his Comedy award-shortlisted show, this black British standup from the Black Country (who opens strong with jokes about that identity) traces the prehistory of his stunted emotional life. Harriott elicits coos of sympathy by describing playground games of kiss chase in which he did neither, and visits to the teen nightclub where he mistook an entanglement with a door handle for a longed-for romantic approach. Harriott is a likable host, and this is a solid standup set with an emotional undertone that the chronic introvert probably deserves an award for revealing. BL Read the review Spencer Jones: The Things We Leave Behind Pleasance Courtyard, until 25 August Jones\u2019s new show is set in his house. He stumbles in late, flicks on the light \u2013 and finds an audience sitting among the half-made props and Things We Leave Behind. That\u2019s his title \u2013 because Jones has been on a mission to salvage other people\u2019s detritus and turn it into comedy. This is an hour of the props tomfoolery we expect from Jones, with the twist that, this year, there\u2019s no pretence it\u2019s a polished production, just a doofus noodling in his basement. This is less standup than chat, amusing and otherwise \u2013 which is fine, because Jones\u2019 shows can\u2019t be measured against anyone else\u2019s standards. They\u2019re about celebrating the fact that a grown man can get away with this, and they show \u2013 this one as luminously as its predecessors \u2013 how imagination and play can render the humdrum delightful.

Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/aug/06/not-the-booker-prize-2019-the-first-three-books-on-our-shortlist-are-\">on from the public vote</a>, our judges from last year have selected Spring by Ali Smith, while our nominated book champions from Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh have chosen <a href=\"https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/flames\">Flames by Robbie Arnott</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/08/supper-club-lara-williams-review-cooking-storm\">Supper Club by Lara Williams</a> respectively.</p> <p>I\u2019m eager to read these new additions \u2013 not least because I\u2019ve read what our expert team of selectors have to say about them.</p> <p>Caroline Dunseath, librarian at Storyhouse, says of Flames:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It interweaves the story of the McAllister family with a cast of characters including a grumpy coffin-maker, a fisherman who hunts with a seal, a river god, an alcoholic private detective and an increasingly unhinged wombat farmer. Each of these characters has a very different voice and style, and Arnott is unafraid to experiment with different narrative forms \u2026 the way these seemingly disparate characters interact with each other is deftly done and the ending had me in tears. This book has been nominated for Australian literary prizes but definitely deserves a wider readership in other countries.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019m taking that last sentence as a hint. Meanwhile, Julie Danskin, the manager at Golden Hare Books has this to say about its nominee:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our selection caused a lot of discussion but, in the end, we went with the brilliant debut Supper Club. A powerfully visceral read, it tells the story of a secret society of women hungry for more than the awful men in their lives can ever give them. Determined to be more than their lot, they quaff, sing and dance until their bodies grow huge from their defiance. Truly brilliant dark fiction with a cover to die for. We also had the pleasure of hosting Lara for the launch for Supper Club, and can vouch she is as excellent a human as she is a writer. We\u2019re really excited about this new talent and we hope she wins!</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, our three judges from last year\u2019s prize united behind Spring by Ali Smith. Graham Fulcher says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spring is the third of Ali Smith\u2019s seasonal quartet, a highlight of each literary year with their rhythmic examination of contemporaneous events through wordplay, historical resonance, female artists who capture past decades (here Katherine Mansfield and the 1920s), Dickens, Charlie Chaplin and Shakespeare\u2019s late romances (here Pericles). [<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2757300832\">Read his full review on Goodreads here</a>.]</p> </blockquote> <p>Cath Barton adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spring is, to me, a profoundly affecting book: about ways of seeing, ways of knowing, ways of understanding, ways of loving. The book\u2019s coincidences, in the words of one of the characters in the book, are of the kind \u201cthat sends electricity through the truths of our lives.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And Eleanor Hayworth writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spring is a timely and powerful novel which touches on the crises of our contemporary world while maintaining a strong core of humanity and a dash of humour.</p> </blockquote> <p>In delivering these eloquent opinions, those judges have completed their final duty. That means we are once again on the lookout for three expert reviewers for this year. One of them could be you. This is your big chance to influence the way things shape up over the next few weeks \u2013 and next year, too.</p> <p>To be a judge, all you need to do is follow the guidance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/22/mug-up-here-on-the-not-the-booker-prize-2019-terms-and-conditions\">our good and righteous terms and conditions:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>12. Three readers will be selected by the Guardian to form a panel of judges from those readers who have made substantial contributions to the discussion of the shortlisted books. The process by which these readers are chosen is also left studiously vague and at the Guardian\u2019s discretion. These judges undertake to read at least three of the six-book shortlist before the final judging meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>That final meeting is crucial to the outcome, but our judges do far more than simply help decide on the winner. Because they join in the discussions throughout the process, they help us do the really important work of discovering what matters about our shortlisted books. They also often provide a useful counter to my own opinions \u2013 and help ensure that other voices are heard throughout the process.</p> <p>If you want to get a sense of what it is like, you can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/oct/15/not-the-booker-prize-2018-winner-watch-judging-meeting\">watch last year\u2019s judging meeting</a> online \u2013 and I hope that you\u2019ll want to join that impressive roster this year.</p> <p>Talking of impressive rosters, here is our final shortlist:</p> <p><a href=\"https://atlantic-books.co.uk/book/flames/\">Flames by Robbie Arnott</a> (Atlantic)</p> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/skin-9781789550405.html\">Skin by Liam Brown</a> (Legend)</p> <p><a href=\"https://deadinkbooks.com/product/ezramaas/\">The Unauthorised Biography Of Ezra Maas by Daniel James</a> (Dead Ink)</p> <p><a href=\"https://deadinkbooks.com/product/leaflet/\">Please Read This Leaflet Carefully by Karen Havelin</a> (Dead Ink)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/30/spring-by-ali-smith-review\">Spring by Ali Smith</a> (Hamish Hamilton)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/08/supper-club-lara-williams-review-cooking-storm\">Supper Club by Lara Williams</a> (Hamish Hamilton)</p> <p>We now have six new books to explore.

      "bodyText": "We now have a full size Not the Booker prize shortlist. Following on from the public vote, our judges from last year have selected Spring by Ali Smith, while our nominated book champions from Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh have chosen Flames by Robbie Arnott and Supper Club by Lara Williams respectively. I\u2019m eager to read these new additions \u2013 not least because I\u2019ve read what our expert team of selectors have to say about them. Caroline Dunseath, librarian at Storyhouse, says of Flames: It interweaves the story of the McAllister family with a cast of characters including a grumpy coffin-maker, a fisherman who hunts with a seal, a river god, an alcoholic private detective and an increasingly unhinged wombat farmer. Each of these characters has a very different voice and style, and Arnott is unafraid to experiment with different narrative forms \u2026 the way these seemingly disparate characters interact with each other is deftly done and the ending had me in tears. This book has been nominated for Australian literary prizes but definitely deserves a wider readership in other countries. I\u2019m taking that last sentence as a hint. Meanwhile, Julie Danskin, the manager at Golden Hare Books has this to say about its nominee: Our selection caused a lot of discussion but, in the end, we went with the brilliant debut Supper Club. A powerfully visceral read, it tells the story of a secret society of women hungry for more than the awful men in their lives can ever give them. Determined to be more than their lot, they quaff, sing and dance until their bodies grow huge from their defiance. Truly brilliant dark fiction with a cover to die for. We also had the pleasure of hosting Lara for the launch for Supper Club, and can vouch she is as excellent a human as she is a writer. We\u2019re really excited about this new talent and we hope she wins! Finally, our three judges from last year\u2019s prize united behind Spring by Ali Smith. Graham Fulcher says: Spring is the third of Ali Smith\u2019s seasonal quartet, a highlight of each literary year with their rhythmic examination of contemporaneous events through wordplay, historical resonance, female artists who capture past decades (here Katherine Mansfield and the 1920s), Dickens, Charlie Chaplin and Shakespeare\u2019s late romances (here Pericles). [Read his full review on Goodreads here.] Cath Barton adds: Spring is, to me, a profoundly affecting book: about ways of seeing, ways of knowing, ways of understanding, ways of loving. The book\u2019s coincidences, in the words of one of the characters in the book, are of the kind \u201cthat sends electricity through the truths of our lives.\u201d And Eleanor Hayworth writes: Spring is a timely and powerful novel which touches on the crises of our contemporary world while maintaining a strong core of humanity and a dash of humour. In delivering these eloquent opinions, those judges have completed their final duty. That means we are once again on the lookout for three expert reviewers for this year. One of them could be you. This is your big chance to influence the way things shape up over the next few weeks \u2013 and next year, too. To be a judge, all you need to do is follow the guidance of our good and righteous terms and conditions: 12. Three readers will be selected by the Guardian to form a panel of judges from those readers who have made substantial contributions to the discussion of the shortlisted books. The process by which these readers are chosen is also left studiously vague and at the Guardian\u2019s discretion. These judges undertake to read at least three of the six-book shortlist before the final judging meeting. That final meeting is crucial to the outcome, but our judges do far more than simply help decide on the winner. Because they join in the discussions throughout the process, they help us do the really important work of discovering what matters about our shortlisted books. They also often provide a useful counter to my own opinions \u2013 and help ensure that other voices are heard throughout the process. If you want to get a sense of what it is like, you can watch last year\u2019s judging meeting online \u2013 and I hope that you\u2019ll want to join that impressive roster this year. Talking of impressive rosters, here is our final shortlist: Flames by Robbie Arnott (Atlantic) Skin by Liam Brown (Legend) The Unauthorised Biography Of Ezra Maas by Daniel James (Dead Ink) Please Read This Leaflet Carefully by Karen Havelin (Dead Ink) Spring by Ali Smith (Hamish Hamilton) Supper Club by Lara Williams (Hamish Hamilton) We now have six new books to explore. I\u2019ll be reading and reviewing them in alphabetical order by author surname at the rate of roughly one a week, starting with Flames by Robbie Arnott next Monday. If I were a stronger person, I\u2019d have been able to avoid all comments about the competition hotting up. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m burning to get reading.",

      "bodyText": "Russian scientists have indicated that they were working on miniaturised sources of nuclear energy when a rocket engine exploded last week, increasing scrutiny of the possibility that the accident occurred while testing an experimental cruise missile powered by a small reactor. The explosion last Thursday at a military testing ground in Russia\u2019s Arkhangelsk region killed at least five people and caused radiation readings in neighbouring cities to spike to 20 times their normal level for half an hour. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said the explosion had taken place during testing of a rocket engine, but the country\u2019s nuclear agency, Rosatom, later confirmed that several of its employees had been killed during testing of an \u201cisotope power source in a liquid propulsion system\u201d. David Cullen, the director of the Nuclear Information Service in the UK, said on Monday that the view among independent experts was that the explosion appeared to have been caused by the failure of an experimental nuclear-powered cruise missile known in Russia as the 9M730 Burevestnik and by Nato as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall. Announced by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in 2018, the missile is theoretically able to use an onboard source of nuclear fuel to heat fast-moving air and fly for indefinite periods. Moscow has touted the missile\u2019s unlimited range and potential ability to penetrate US missile defences, but doubts remain among researchers as to whether its core technology is viable. Experts in Russia\u2019s nuclear programme have also spotted the nuclear fuel carrier ship Serebryanka near the site of last week\u2019s explosion, where it is believed to have been taking part in a recovery effort. The vessel had previously been spotted in the waters near Novaya Zemlya, where Russia reportedly tested the Burevestnik missile in 2017. \u201cOur suspicion is that something went wrong during or after a Russian test of its nuclear-powered cruise missile,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Lewis, a US arms control specialist with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Russia was believed to have moved Burevestnik testing to the current Nenoksa site earlier this year. In a video statement released on Sunday evening, an official from the Russian Federal Nuclear Centre, where five employees were killed in the explosion, said the agency was working on a number of experimental technologies, including \u201cminiaturised sources of energy using [fissile] materials\u201d. Vyacheslav Solovyov, the centre\u2019s scientific director, said similar work on \u201csmall-scale nuclear reactors\u201d is also taking place in the US. He did not say how much fissile material had been involved in the accident, or what role it may have played in the explosion. \u201cWe are now trying to understand, we are working closely with a government commission, analysing the entire chain of events to assess the scale of the accident and to understand its causes,\u201d Solovyov said. The slow release of information has heightened concerns that a major incident took place offshore from the Nenoksa missile testing site. Residents of Severodvinsk and other northern cities had reportedly stocked up on iodine, which reduces the effects of exposure to radiation. Russia has also closed a bay in the White Sea near where the accident took place for a month, indicating possible contamination or a continuing search operation. The development of an experimental weapon such as the Burevestnik would also help to explain the secrecy around the incident, despite public concerns over radiation levels. The US tried and failed to develop ground-hugging nuclear-powered cruise missile technology during the cold war, and questions remain as to whether the Burevestnik has a meaningful purpose, given the existence of high flying intercontinental ballistic missiles as an alternative. Such experimental long-range cruise missiles would not have been covered by the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty between the US and Russia that lapsed last month, because it only banned land-based cruise missiles with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (300 and 3,400 miles). Cullen said, however, that the test failure was \u201csymptomatic of a wider escalation in nuclear tensions stemming from a gradual breakdown in US-Russia relations\u201d partly because \u201cRussia is trying to rectify what it believes is a strategic disadvantage it has against the US by developing non-conventional capabilities\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>At Valvona &amp; Crolla, a venerable Edinburgh deli dating from 1934, I am eating arancini for breakfast and trying to make sense of the abundance of food-related shows at this year\u2019s fringe. For three days, I\u2019ve plodded rain-drenched backstreets, consuming hours of drama, comedy and performance art about eating. I\u2019ve watched comfort food cabarets and comedy about the Toby Carvery, listened to rants about clean eating and calorific excess and met (albeit figuratively) the young women who tested Hitler\u2019s dinner each evening for poison.</p> <p>There has been a drama about a British-Chinese family, Citizens of Nowhere?, staged in the restaurant of a Novotel hotel, and a Fawlty Towers dining experience where a man with a stick-on moustache and a faux-Spanish accent proffers waldorf salad to fans of the 70s sitcom. In Hold On Let Go, a drama with music by Paul Smith from Maximo Park, bread is baked live on stage. Despite all the walking, I\u2019ve gained extra pounds, having eaten chocolate mousse made by an Australian woman singing Teenage Dream by Katy Perry as she whisked, plus a weirdly delicious chicken caesar salad made in a cement mixer by the anarchist cook George Egg.</p> <p>The highlight, however, took place in a humid, rather fetid drama space in Summerhall, as 20 of us watched the performance artist Sacha Plaige silently dissect the concept of dining during her one-woman show Feast, by Clout Productions. Plaige\u2019s deft movement contains traces of Rik Mayall, Leigh Bowery and Bj\u00f6rk while remaining beguilingly unique. It is a wordless, head-spinning, messy muse on appetite, scarcity, debauchery and greed. Plaige eerily mimics a chicken being roasted, flavouring herself first with parsley, shrinking as her skin becomes crisp and irresistible. Although she squashes tomatoes behind her knees, devours raw onion and rolls in cornflakes, it is the section where Plaige mimics the masks we adopt around fine wine \u2013 from the sommelier\u2019s proud brandishing of a label to the customer feigning knowledge of a vintage \u2013 that stays with me long after the performance.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m half French,\u201d Plaige tells me afterwards. \u201cSo I wanted to show that wine tasting, this delicate process, is actually grotesque. The gargling, the sniffing and swirling, the spitting through teeth. It\u2019s an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the process.\u201d Plaige describes <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/feast\">Feast</a> as \u201cvisceral\u201d. She doesn\u2019t warn the audience they might get hit by fruit pips or watch a courgette make love to a melon. Yet, on the night I went, this worked out very well. \u201cFeast is about our relationship with food. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be political, but then food does mark how and where we belong in society \u2026 hunger, excess. I\u2019m interested in how we often disrespect the things we are given. We gorge, we eat too much, we do things to our own bodies that are violent and scary.\u201d By the end of Feast, as a viewer I felt exhausted. As a restaurant critic, I felt understood. Plaige is delighted. There\u2019s a sense, she says, \u201cthat I have taken my skin off every night\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9723e03df663ee0ea530ba04b0c7f3e5be877f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9723e03df663ee0ea530ba04b0c7f3e5be877f/0_285_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lavinia Savignoni in The Perfect Body\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lavinia Savignoni in The Perfect Body.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another piece that tackles the human obsession with food is the one-woman show <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/perfect-body\">The Perfect Body</a>, by the Italian actor Lavinia Savignoni. She delivers a whirlwind, nigh-hysterical 50-minute monologue on \u201cwellness\u201d, diets, purging and the ghosts of our past that haunt every mouthful we eat. Savignoni plays the part of a clean-eating guru and Instagram star, dispatching juicing advice to clients longing to be as happy, toned and centred as she is. On stage, Savignoni loads a juicer with melon and guava. Vitamins are paramount! Meat is evil! Wheat will cause inflammation!</p> <p>Savignoni\u2019s facade soon slips as she rambles into a secret world of hunger, craving and painful-sounding coffee enemas. Both The Perfect Body and Feast contain moments where young actors squat on stage straining to evacuate their bowels and flush the \u201cbadness\u201d out. Both shows view food as friend and enemy. After watching The Perfect Body, I ate a warm cinnamon twirl from Baba Budan, weighing up, exactly as Savignoni would have, the calorie value against the seven miles I walked the previous day.</p> <p>What was needed, after all this truth, was comedy; so off I went to see Pierre Novellie\u2019s You\u2019re Expected To Care. Novellie is one of my favourite funny-thinkers, as well as a food lover who cannot help writing material about Christmas dinner, Chinese takeaways and his fight to stay slim and TV-ready as all new-wave comedians must. In his show, Novellie, who is South African, puzzles over the intrinsic sogginess of British cuisine. Our need to add vinegar to battered fish. Our need to roast meat for so long that the juice depletes, then scoop these same juices to add back. \u201cWe moved from South Africa to the Isle of Man,\u201d he tells me, \u201cand I can still vividly remember queueing up for my very first school lunch. Nuggets, yes, chips, yes, but then beans poured all over everything. It was outrageous. Why do the British need to put a varnish on their food?\u201d Novellie\u2019s breakdown of the British gravy obsession is deliciously funny to a northern woman like me. He never mentions the word Brexit, but it hangs in the air like Bisto.</p> <p>Pity and anxiety for those eating alone is laid bare in Gareth Mutch\u2019s new show, The Old Man in the Carvery, in which Mutch, who is in his mid-20s, discusses a moment that has haunted him. As a teen, Mutch met an elderly solo diner in a Toby Inn in Livingston, West Lothian. \u201cJust sitting there \u2026 on his own \u2026 and he thought we were laughing at him \u2026 but we weren\u2019t. It just looked like that.\u201d Mutch says that he has let this diner who was clearly alone in the whole world, maybe widowed, maybe worse, define his adult happiness. But did the whole thing even happen? Mutch\u2019s chaotic hour is really about how, in the absence of true angst, sometimes the brain likes to invent things. Nor does he talk about carvery at all, which was clearly quite a shock to many audience members who had bought tickets to hear 45 blistering minutes on the Toby Inn\u2019s limitless veg and stuffing ball policy.</p> <p>Another show that left me puzzled was Hitler\u2019s Tasters, although it was playing to sellout crowds. Based on true events, this hour explores the world of loyal young Third Reich women sitting in a room gossiping while waiting for a meal that may or may not kill them. The subject matter is fascinating and there are moments of pathos, but the thrust of this venture relies on the girls snapping selfies of themselves continually and at one point having a rather long twerking session wearing swastika vests that is pure Springtime for Hitler. This is apt, as the play is written by Mel Brooks\u2019s daughter-in-law, Michelle Kholos Brooks. It is a strange way to pass an hour; especially at the end, when the actors begin flogging Hitler\u2019s Tasters merchandise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdb4cd22fcf9bb233be0a4c430d1b4c6fa5cbf6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdb4cd22fcf9bb233be0a4c430d1b4c6fa5cbf6a/0_206_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Egg\u2019s Movable Feast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Egg\u2019s Movable Feast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I lament the shows I\u2019ve missed. I failed to see Chocolate by the Java Dance Theatre, which promised a rich, dark story, the air heavy with cocoa and a performer smeared with melted goo. I missed the rather wonderfully titled The Only Thing a Great Actress Needs Is a Great Play &amp; the Desire to Succeed, where two Mexican domestic servants cook breakfast. The Edinburgh festival is like a tremendous running buffet of things you\u2019ve never tasted. All you can do is stack your plate up and hope you enjoy some. Others will stick in your throat and you will overlook some things completely.</p> <p>One selection I\u2019m happy I made was <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/george-egg-movable-feast\">George Egg\u2019s Mov</a><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/george-egg-movable-feast\">able Feast</a>, in which an anarchist amateur chef cooks a three-course meal with power tools, laptops and a cement mixer, then shares it outside with the audience. There is a mischievousness about Egg\u2019s humour that is deeply lovable. Egg was never a chef, but he did once run the crepe stall for the circus troupe Archaos. In Movable Feast, he plays the part of one man against the system, eschewing boring service station food, going off-menu at Pret with his own salmon sous-vide, cooking aubergine on a Virgin Pendolino, caesar salad on a building site and haddock on his car engine as he motors down the highway.</p> <p>\u201cThis show is about anarchy, resourcefulness and the ability to cope with life\u2019s situations,\u201d Egg says when I chat to him afterwards. At the end of each show, audiences line up to chat about his recipes. \u201cA man came in who couldn\u2019t see the other day,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he loved it. He could smell the toasting aubergine with tahini way before everyone else.\u201d In a world of food restrictions, it is rather quaint to see queues of strangers digging in together, sharing forks, not giving a stuff for allergy advice labels and the threat of cross-contamination.</p> <p>\u201cI come here every two years,\u201d Egg says. \u201cI love anything to do with food. It was either this, or run a cafe.\u201d I left Edinburgh 4lb (1.8kg) heavier. On balance, it was totally worth it.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 August 2019 because the Citizens of Nowhere? show is a drama about a British-Chinese family set in a hotel restaurant, not an immigration drama set in a hotel kitchen as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.</p>",

It is a strange way to pass an hour; especially at the end, when the actors begin flogging Hitler\u2019s Tasters merchandise. I lament the shows I\u2019ve missed. I failed to see Chocolate by the Java Dance Theatre, which promised a rich, dark story, the air heavy with cocoa and a performer smeared with melted goo. I missed the rather wonderfully titled The Only Thing a Great Actress Needs Is a Great Play &amp; the Desire to Succeed, where two Mexican domestic servants cook breakfast. The Edinburgh festival is like a tremendous running buffet of things you\u2019ve never tasted. All you can do is stack your plate up and hope you enjoy some. Others will stick in your throat and you will overlook some things completely. One selection I\u2019m happy I made was George Egg\u2019s Movable Feast, in which an anarchist amateur chef cooks a three-course meal with power tools, laptops and a cement mixer, then shares it outside with the audience. There is a mischievousness about Egg\u2019s humour that is deeply lovable. Egg was never a chef, but he did once run the crepe stall for the circus troupe Archaos. In Movable Feast, he plays the part of one man against the system, eschewing boring service station food, going off-menu at Pret with his own salmon sous-vide, cooking aubergine on a Virgin Pendolino, caesar salad on a building site and haddock on his car engine as he motors down the highway. \u201cThis show is about anarchy, resourcefulness and the ability to cope with life\u2019s situations,\u201d Egg says when I chat to him afterwards. At the end of each show, audiences line up to chat about his recipes. \u201cA man came in who couldn\u2019t see the other day,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he loved it. He could smell the toasting aubergine with tahini way before everyone else.\u201d In a world of food restrictions, it is rather quaint to see queues of strangers digging in together, sharing forks, not giving a stuff for allergy advice labels and the threat of cross-contamination. \u201cI come here every two years,\u201d Egg says. \u201cI love anything to do with food. It was either this, or run a cafe.\u201d I left Edinburgh 4lb (1.8kg) heavier. On balance, it was totally worth it. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 August 2019 because the Citizens of Nowhere? show is a drama about a British-Chinese family set in a hotel restaurant, not an immigration drama set in a hotel kitchen as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

These include House of Fraser, which Sports Direct described as \u201cterminal\u201d when it released delayed and disappointing financial results last month, and \u201cpreppy\u201d clothing brand Jack Wills.

It is very difficult for me when I lose a match and I go back home to find my daughters and wife very sad, as they are supporters as well, so sometimes it is hard to manage this club being a supporter as well.\u201d The former Eibar head coach taught himself English purely through reading and he is also very studious when it comes to other coaches. \u201cI really like J\u00fcrgen Klopp for his way of being, his leadership, the style of play I really like; direct football, they play very fast, attacking football, keeping their defence very high, pressing very high and it is a football I really like and is very similar to our style of play.\u201d Links to England go back to Athletic\u2019s founding 121 years ago and there is still plenty of them left at the San Mames. Two of their most successful managers, Fred Pentland and Howard Kendall, were English, men Garitano is looking to emulate. \u201cNo doubt about it,\u201d Garitano responds after being asked if Athletic are still influenced by England. \u201cWhen we play in Spain we are known for being the English club because our style of play, the atmosphere in the stadium, the way of being of the Basque people and sometimes we look like an English team. We are very proud of this, it is our style and we are not going to change because throughout history things have gone well for us and we need to continue in this way.\u201d There are few sights more joyful in football than Athletic supporters swarming into Bilbao city centre to celebrate a major trophy, they even packed the streets after lifting the curtain-raising Spanish Super Cup in 2015, inflicting a 5-1 aggregate defeat on the double winners Barcelona. When the club win one of the major trophies the players and staff travel down the River Nervion on la gabarra, a barge, which has not been seen since 1984. But there is growing optimism again under Garitano. \u201cThe president told me last week that they are fixing and cleaning la gabarra because in the last decade it has been hiding and trying to be repaired in the hope that one day we will use it again. But it is a very difficult task.\u201d Can Athletic win their first trophy in 35 years this season? \u201cWhy not? We have to try. It is my dream.\u201d",

The Hong Kong police will likely have large stockpiles of UK-made arms ready to be used \u2013 and indeed, images of rubber smoke grenades with the markings of UK companies continue to emerge. Hunt\u2019s words were undermined further when it was revealed that the Hong Kong military is among the delegations invited to the Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair in London next month. DSEI is one of the biggest arms fairs in the world. It brings international arms companies to the London Docklands to meet with representatives from the world\u2019s most authoritarian despots and dictatorships. By inviting the Hong Kong authorities, the UK is sending the message that its history of violence and repression can be overlooked and that the rights of people in Hong Kong are less important than securing arms sales. The full guest list reads like a roll call of human rights-abusing regimes, with military delegations from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, the Philippines and Egypt joining their Hong Kong counterparts. The delegations will be given the red-carpet treatment and greeted by civil servants. Arms companies will try to entice them with the latest hi-tech weaponry and killing machines. Unfortunately there is nothing new in this approach. For decades, the British government \u2013 be it Conservative, Labour or coalition \u2013 has prioritised the interests of arms companies over human rights. And the signs are that it will only get worse under Boris Johnson. With the uncertainty of Brexit on the horizon, it is likely that the government will do all it can to boost UK manufacturing by promoting arms sales and selling repression around the world. Figures from the Department for International Trade show that 2018 was a bumper year for the UK arms industry, with \u00a314bn worth of arms exports, a marked increase on 2017. Over the past year, the UK has been the world\u2019s second biggest arms exporter, behind the US. There is no doubt that Johnson will use the same rhetoric about human rights and democracy as his predecessors. But it will ring hollow to people who are campaigning against the regimes being armed and supported by Downing Street. Whether it is in Hong Kong, Turkey or Bahrain, the UK government must show meaningful solidarity and support for the rights of campaigners, rather than continuing to contribute to their repression. \u2022 Andrew Smith is a spokesperson for Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), @CAATuk \u2022 This piece was amended on 12 August 2019. An earlier version said that the value of UK arms exports in 2018 was \u00a35.2bn",

Each day is a struggle to scrape together enough money and food to reach the next.</p>\n    <p>Electricity, clean water, toilets, healthcare and schools are either non-existent or not available to all residents. At any one time, 50% of Kibera's 15- to 25-year-old women are pregnant. Abortion is illegal and contraception scarce. Rape and child sex abuse is endemic. Abuse of drink and drugs is rife.

Unless you find them or they are held by a parent until we arrive, it is difficult, as they run, especially teenagers,\u201d says Nyangweso.</p> \n<p>\u201cYesterday we attended a call to a young girl who had had sex with man with HIV. We don\u2019t know whether it was with consent or rape as she ran away. Here after 24 hours or a bath you cannot prove it was rape. We spent the day searching for her then gave up.\u201d</p> \n<p>If rape is suspected the paramedics have to stop at Kibera\u2019s police station to report it before going to hospital. \u201cAt the police station they check outer clothing for signs of assault or semen. Only if they agree it\u2019s rape \u2013 [then] we take the victim to hospital. If the family give consent the hospital will go through the examination process but up until recently it was not free, they had to pay. Likewise for DNA tests, but this changed recently. Sometimes having to pay is a problem, so maybe they leave it, treat the victim and go back home. Then later you hear that the father or husband of the raped woman has fought the suspect and a grudge builds between the two families.\u201d</p> \n<p>A significant number of the guilty go unpunished. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, imagine as a parent, having a girl of 15 and a man who knows he has a disease goes with her. A girl whom you as a parent are trying to bring up to be somebody in society. Then he does something like that and goes unpunished. It hurts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prostitution is rife in Kibera, including among the very young, says Nyangweso. \u201cThey do it to help their mothers \u2026 mothers send them to do it, saying: \u2018Bring money so I can feed your younger brothers and sisters,\u2019\u201d she says. Women are also trapped into having sex with other men to feed their children, says Nyangweso.</p> \n<p>She says the government must be stronger on rape, prostitution and violence against women \u201cbecause that is the beginning of the family. Without rights there is no future.\u201d</p> \n<p>She adds that the government should create jobs for Kibera\u2019s men. \u201cMany are idle, drinking cheap brews, causing indiscipline and shortening their lives \u2013 but I think they simply don\u2019t care. [They think:] \u2018I will never be a victim because I can [punch] somebody. I cannot allow it to happen, I\u2019m capable.\u2019 These things happen to women in Kibera because they are not independent, but I can live my own life with my children and if my husband starts, I can tell him to leave.

      "body": "<p>When Clara\u2019s family were planning a holiday to celebrate a series of milestones and anniversaries, they each put their dream destination into a hat and her mother pulled out Tobago. And so, in April 2014, Clara spent two weeks on the Caribbean island with her parents and sister. Clara and her mother decided to stay on for a bit longer, moving out of the resort and into a guesthouse in a village. One day they visited the rainforest and met Nkosi, who had just started a new job as a tour guide there. He offered to take them into the forest but Clara\u2019s mother didn\u2019t want to do a tour. When they came out, Nkosi was still there, and Clara\u2019s mother offered him a lift.</p> <p>What should have been a 20-minute drive turned into an all-day trip, with Nkosi showing them around the island. What did they talk about? \u201cI would have just shown off about Tobago,\u201d says Nkosi, with a laugh. Clara says: \u201cI was feeling really shy. I think my mum was doing most of the talking.\u201d</p> <p>They had all got on so well that Nkosi invited Clara and her mother for breakfast the next morning at the house he had built. \u201cThat, for me, was like, \u2018Wow, this person\u2019s really cool,\u2019\u201d says Clara. \u201cI felt drawn to you then. My mum must have picked up on it because she was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019d better take her home now before I leave her here for ever.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What did Clara like about him? \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to someone being so genuine,\u201d she says. Boyfriends in the past \u201calways had an image of themselves they wanted to portray and Nkosi seemed so open and honest, and it was quite disarming to meet such a pure heart. He wasn\u2019t flirty at all, just warm to me and my mum.\u201d Was he keen on Clara? He says he didn\u2019t want to seem too forward, but \u201cI thought, \u2018I like this girl.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b914d61d74f3a1750bfd5df607b9beb375add26e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b914d61d74f3a1750bfd5df607b9beb375add26e/251_1834_3909_4886/800.jpg\" alt=\"Clara and Nkosi at their wedding\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clara and Nkosi married in Tobago and hope to live together in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Quan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day, Nkosi took them out on a boat trip with his friend. \u201cI could feel that Nkosi, just the way he helped me on to the boat, was just a bit more tactile,\u201d Clara remembers.

      "bodyText": "Sarah Silverman has said she was recently fired from a film after producers unearthed a still of her in 2007 wearing blackface for a comedy sketch. Guesting on The Bill Simmons Podcast, Silverman said that she was let go the day before shooting on her scenes was due to start because of the photo, taken on the set of The Sarah Silverman Show. \u201cI recently was going to do a movie, a sweet part,\u201d she said, \u201cthen, at 11pm the night before, they fired me because they saw a picture of me in blackface from that episode. \u201cI didn\u2019t fight it. They hired someone else who is wonderful but who has never stuck their neck out. It was so disheartening. It just made me real, real sad, because I really kind of devoted my life to making it right.\u201d Silverman did not name the film but discussed \u201ccancel culture\u201d with Simmons, saying that the current climate had left her feeling fearful. \u201cI think it\u2019s really scary and it\u2019s a very odd thing that it\u2019s invaded the left primarily and the right will mimic it,\u201d adding that she dubs it \u201crighteousness porn\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like, if you\u2019re not on board, if you say the wrong thing, if you had a tweet once, everyone is, like, throwing the first stone,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s so odd. It\u2019s a perversion. It\u2019s really, \u2018Look how righteous I am and now I\u2019m going to press refresh all day long to see how many likes I get in my righteousness.\u2019\u201d Silverman has previously expressed mixed feelings concerning the sketch, telling GQ last month that at the time she was praised for the sketch, which enormously increased her profile. \u201cIt was like, I\u2019m playing a character, and I know this is wrong, so I can say it. I\u2019m clearly liberal. That was such liberal-bubble stuff, where I actually thought it was dealing with racism by using racism. \u201cI don\u2019t get joy in that any more. It makes me feel yucky.

A small number of private providers can also award degrees.</p> <h2>How many students go to university in the UK?</h2> <p>In the 2017-18 academic year, there were <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/17-01-2019/sb252-higher-education-student-statistics/numbers\" title=\"\">2.3 million students</a> in higher education, which is just over 3% of the UK population.

The student loans system requires students to pay for all or some of their degree after they graduate. Repayments are deducted as a percentage of their salary after they start earning \u00a325,000, and the outstanding balance is written off after 30 years. As such, the government will effectively pay for some of a graduate\u2019s degree, though how much depends on their lifetime earnings.</p> <p>Most universities in the UK have charity status and <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2016/university-funding-explained.pdf\" title=\"\">on average</a> they receive just over a quarter of their funding from the government in the form of research grants and funding to cover the teaching of high cost subjects.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/finances/table-7\" title=\"\">According to figures released by Hesa</a>, universities generated \u00a338.2bn in total last year, of which half (49%) came from tuition fees and education contracts. Various sources made up the rest of their income, including funding body grants (13%) and research funding organisations (16%). Some institutions, such as Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London, receive significant endowments and donations, while others receive next to none. Oxbridge was reported last year to hold nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/28/oxford-and-cambridge-university-colleges-hold-21bn-in-riches\" title=\"\">\u00a321bn</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/28/oxford-and-cambridge-university-colleges-hold-21bn-in-riches\" title=\"\">in assets</a>.</p> <p>There is also a small but growing number of private universities in the UK that can award degrees, such as the University of Buckingham and Regent\u2019s University London. Their tuition is not subsidised by the government and so they usually charge higher fees.</p> <p>Part of their appeal is their flexible admissions systems: students apply directly, rather than via Ucas, which can be attractive to international students and applicants with non-academic qualifications. Other selling points might include a subject specialism \u2013 as typified by the <a href=\"https://www.law.ac.uk/postgraduate//?utm_source=Adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_campaign=TCSPGBrand&amp;utm_ID=12136&amp;mh_matchtype=e&amp;mh_keyword=university%20of%20law&amp;mh_adgroupid=55370901241&amp;mh_network=g&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo7Px3Lra4wIVVeDtCh3XQQTuEAAYASAAEgLFRfD_BwE\" title=\"\">University of Law</a> \u2013 or a high staff-student ratio.</p> <h2>Are all universities profitable?</h2> <p>Some universities say they are struggling because of competition for students, political uncertainty and weakened finances. Last year, some English universities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/30/fears-university-closures-office-for-students\" title=\"\">were reported to be at risk of closure</a> following a drop in enrolments. Several universities have faced falls in numbers in recent years, including Kingston University, London Metropolitan University and the University of Cumbria.</p> <p>Experts warn that some institutions are risking financial vulnerability.</p> <p>\u201cI think we are closer to seeing a university suffer financial collapse than at any point in living memory,\u201d says Nick Hillman, director of Hepi and a former government adviser.</p> <p>Hillman says universities lost a safety net when the government closed the Higher Education Funding Council for England in April last year and replaced it with the Office for Students (OfS). The OfS, which takes on its full legal powers this summer, has already indicated that it will not support institutions in financial trouble in the same way the old funding council did.</p> <p>But institutional failure is not inevitable, Hillman adds. \u201cWhatever people may say now, if any big institution does go under, I suspect public authorities will have to step in to facilitate a merger, takeover or bailout.\u201d</p> <h2>Is it still worth going to university?</h2> <p>It\u2019s a fair question. The financial burden of a degree isn\u2019t to be taken lightly. Since tuition fees were tripled in 2012, university applicants have faced a large debt that keeps rising due to high interest rates. The average graduate debt \u2013 tuition compounded by maintenance costs and high rates of interest \u2013 stands at more than \u00a350,000 for a three-year degree.</p> <p>After the maintenance grant was scrapped in 2016, many students have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/15/students-struggle-to-support-themselves-as-university-rent-costs-rise\" title=\"\">struggled to manage financially</a> during term time. The grant was replaced by the maintenance loan, which averages at \u00a3509 per month, but its value has since declined in real terms as rent and other living costs have risen.</p> <p>The pressures extend to parents, who stump up an average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/18/parents-use-savings-and-second-jobs-to-support-children-at-university\" title=\"\">\u00a3360 a month</a> to support their children\u2019s studies, according to a recent survey. Students don\u2019t get the full maintenance loan if their parents\u2019 household income is higher than \u00a330,000, so parents are expected to make up the rest.</p> <p>That said, a degree still pays off in the long run. According to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/graduate-labour-market-statistics-2018\" title=\"\">the latest official </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/graduate-labour-market-statistics-2018\" title=\"\">statistics</a>, graduates last year earned a median salary of \u00a334,000, while non-graduates earned only \u00a324,000.</p> <p>But some students will benefit from a bigger wage premium than others. For instance, white graduates earned a median salary of \u00a335,550, compared with \u00a325,500 for black graduates. The graduate gender pay gap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/25/women-with-masters-degrees-paid-less-than-men-without-them-in-england\" title=\"\">has widened slightly since 2016</a>, with the median salary for graduate men rising by \u00a31,500 more than for women.</p> <p>Of course, these financial metrics are only so helpful. The value of a university education to an individual student can\u2019t merely be measured by graduate earnings, if it can be measured at at all. People study for no single reason and the benefits to them and society are wide-ranging.</p> <h2>Which universities or courses offer the best employment prospects?</h2> <p>Graduates from the Russell Group of universities and comparable institutions tend to earn the most, according to last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/714517/The_relative_labour_market-returns_to_different_degrees.pdf\" title=\"\">data</a> from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Across the board, the average graduate earns between \u00a326,000 and \u00a330,000 after five years.</p> <p>The highest earners of any gender are graduates from the London School of Economics, with women earning \u00a345,000 on average and men earning more than \u00a360,000.</p> <p>The most employed graduates are in medicine and related professions. Medicine, maths and economics graduates earn at least 30% more than the average graduate, while creative arts graduates have the lowest employment figures and earn about 15% less than the average. (These figures don\u2019t include income through self-employment.)</p> <p>Some courses show a wide variation in salary uplift depending on the institution. Top-ranking business degrees, for example, yield earnings more than 50% higher than the average graduate wage, while business studies students from the lowest-ranking universities earn below the average.</p> <h2>Is it cheaper to study in Europe?</h2> <p>Several universities in Europe offer the opportunity to study for free or for a lower tuition fee than in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-germany\" title=\"\">German universities</a> offer students places with free tuition, as do some institutions in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland.</p> <p>These countries offer lots of courses in English, although students may need to meet language requirements for others. Accommodation and other costs will obviously vary.</p> <p>In Scotland, tuition is free for Scottish students and students from the EU, but not to other UK students.</p> <p>Another study abroad option is the Erasmus+ student exchange programme. This September, about 17,000 students plan to move overseas for a year through the EU-funded scheme. However, its future is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/19/erasmus-scheme-chaos-uk-students-limbo-funding-accommodation\" title=\"\">uncertain</a> as the government has so far failed to guarantee funding for the scheme amid the Brexit tumult.</p> <h2>What are the best alternatives?</h2> <p>The academic route isn\u2019t for everyone. There are plenty of alternatives, including distance learning and online courses, which can be done remotely and part-time.

      "bodyText": "How many UK universities are there? There are about 140 universities in the UK. It depends on your definition of a university: if it stretches to any public institution with degree-awarding powers, then the number rises to 164, according to Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) data. A small number of private providers can also award degrees. How many students go to university in the UK? In the 2017-18 academic year, there were 2.3 million students in higher education, which is just over 3% of the UK population. Some 57% of these students were women. The proportion of UK students from minority ethnic backgrounds increased by four percentage points over five years, from 20% in 2013-14 to 24% in 2017-18. University enrolments have risen steadily since 2015, when the government lifted the cap on student recruitment to increase competition. The system is now driven by demand as institutions scramble to attract students each year. How many freshers will there be this autumn? As of July, a record 275,520 young people applied to university through Ucas for undergraduate courses starting in 2019. That\u2019s an increase of 1% on this time last year, despite a 1.9% dip in the country\u2019s population of 18-year-olds. The upward trend is expected to continue as the 18-year-old population rises. The Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) thinktank recently predicted that universities will need to provide at least 300,000 more places by 2030 to meet demand. As for mature students, entry rates have declined by half since 2012, particularly in part-time and non-undergraduate courses. More than 1.3 million students in the UK are over 21 years old. More than 40,000 overseas students could face difficulties applying for visas this September after the process was outsourced to the French IT services company Sopra Steria, which has received complaints about delays and high appointment costs. Are all the universities public? No university in the UK is completely publicly funded. The student loans system requires students to pay for all or some of their degree after they graduate. Repayments are deducted as a percentage of their salary after they start earning \u00a325,000, and the outstanding balance is written off after 30 years. As such, the government will effectively pay for some of a graduate\u2019s degree, though how much depends on their lifetime earnings. Most universities in the UK have charity status and on average they receive just over a quarter of their funding from the government in the form of research grants and funding to cover the teaching of high cost subjects. According to figures released by Hesa, universities generated \u00a338.2bn in total last year, of which half (49%) came from tuition fees and education contracts. Various sources made up the rest of their income, including funding body grants (13%) and research funding organisations (16%). Some institutions, such as Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London, receive significant endowments and donations, while others receive next to none. Oxbridge was reported last year to hold nearly \u00a321bn in assets. There is also a small but growing number of private universities in the UK that can award degrees, such as the University of Buckingham and Regent\u2019s University London. Their tuition is not subsidised by the government and so they usually charge higher fees. Part of their appeal is their flexible admissions systems: students apply directly, rather than via Ucas, which can be attractive to international students and applicants with non-academic qualifications. Other selling points might include a subject specialism \u2013 as typified by the University of Law \u2013 or a high staff-student ratio. Are all universities profitable? Some universities say they are struggling because of competition for students, political uncertainty and weakened finances. Last year, some English universities were reported to be at risk of closure following a drop in enrolments. Several universities have faced falls in numbers in recent years, including Kingston University, London Metropolitan University and the University of Cumbria. Experts warn that some institutions are risking financial vulnerability. \u201cI think we are closer to seeing a university suffer financial collapse than at any point in living memory,\u201d says Nick Hillman, director of Hepi and a former government adviser. Hillman says universities lost a safety net when the government closed the Higher Education Funding Council for England in April last year and replaced it with the Office for Students (OfS). The OfS, which takes on its full legal powers this summer, has already indicated that it will not support institutions in financial trouble in the same way the old funding council did. But institutional failure is not inevitable, Hillman adds. \u201cWhatever people may say now, if any big institution does go under, I suspect public authorities will have to step in to facilitate a merger, takeover or bailout.\u201d Is it still worth going to university? It\u2019s a fair question. The financial burden of a degree isn\u2019t to be taken lightly. Since tuition fees were tripled in 2012, university applicants have faced a large debt that keeps rising due to high interest rates. The average graduate debt \u2013 tuition compounded by maintenance costs and high rates of interest \u2013 stands at more than \u00a350,000 for a three-year degree. After the maintenance grant was scrapped in 2016, many students have struggled to manage financially during term time. The grant was replaced by the maintenance loan, which averages at \u00a3509 per month, but its value has since declined in real terms as rent and other living costs have risen. The pressures extend to parents, who stump up an average \u00a3360 a month to support their children\u2019s studies, according to a recent survey. Students don\u2019t get the full maintenance loan if their parents\u2019 household income is higher than \u00a330,000, so parents are expected to make up the rest. That said, a degree still pays off in the long run. According to the latest official statistics, graduates last year earned a median salary of \u00a334,000, while non-graduates earned only \u00a324,000. But some students will benefit from a bigger wage premium than others. For instance, white graduates earned a median salary of \u00a335,550, compared with \u00a325,500 for black graduates. The graduate gender pay gap has widened slightly since 2016, with the median salary for graduate men rising by \u00a31,500 more than for women. Of course, these financial metrics are only so helpful. The value of a university education to an individual student can\u2019t merely be measured by graduate earnings, if it can be measured at at all. People study for no single reason and the benefits to them and society are wide-ranging. Which universities or courses offer the best employment prospects? Graduates from the Russell Group of universities and comparable institutions tend to earn the most, according to last year\u2019s data from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Across the board, the average graduate earns between \u00a326,000 and \u00a330,000 after five years. The highest earners of any gender are graduates from the London School of Economics, with women earning \u00a345,000 on average and men earning more than \u00a360,000. The most employed graduates are in medicine and related professions. Medicine, maths and economics graduates earn at least 30% more than the average graduate, while creative arts graduates have the lowest employment figures and earn about 15% less than the average. (These figures don\u2019t include income through self-employment.) Some courses show a wide variation in salary uplift depending on the institution. Top-ranking business degrees, for example, yield earnings more than 50% higher than the average graduate wage, while business studies students from the lowest-ranking universities earn below the average. Is it cheaper to study in Europe? Several universities in Europe offer the opportunity to study for free or for a lower tuition fee than in the UK. German universities offer students places with free tuition, as do some institutions in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland. These countries offer lots of courses in English, although students may need to meet language requirements for others. Accommodation and other costs will obviously vary. In Scotland, tuition is free for Scottish students and students from the EU, but not to other UK students. Another study abroad option is the Erasmus+ student exchange programme. This September, about 17,000 students plan to move overseas for a year through the EU-funded scheme. However, its future is uncertain as the government has so far failed to guarantee funding for the scheme amid the Brexit tumult. What are the best alternatives? The academic route isn\u2019t for everyone. There are plenty of alternatives, including distance learning and online courses, which can be done remotely and part-time. Further education colleges offer higher apprenticeships and foundation degrees, which combine academic and vocational study. The newest option is a degree apprenticeship, which was launched in 2015. For three or four years, apprentices study for their degree while gaining paid industry experience. Course costs are covered by the employer and the government, meaning degree apprentices often don\u2019t have to pay for their tuition.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Victims outraged at losing chance to confront Epstein in court Authorities in three separate jurisdictions, including the FBI and DoJ, have opened investigations into the apparent suicide of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in a New York jail cell, after the 66-year-old was taken off suicide watch following a previous attempt to take his own life. The well-connected billionaire sex offender, who faced trial over sex trafficking allegations going back to the early 2000s, was found dead on Saturday morning, leaving his victims outraged over the lost opportunity to confront him in court \u2013 and leading Donald Trump and others to foment conspiracy theories. Cause of death. New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner said on Sunday night that an autopsy had been conducted, but more information was needed to determine Epstein\u2019s cause of death. Case closed? Does Epstein\u2019s death mean the end of a scandal that also threatened to engulf his rich and powerful friends? His victims certainly hope not, as Henry McDonald explains. Guatemala elects leader opposed to Trump immigration deal Guatemala has elected a new president who called the current government\u2019s immigration deal with the Trump administration \u201cbad news\u201d. Alejandro Giammattei, leader of the conservative Vamos (Let\u2019s Go) party, looked to have secured almost 59% of the vote in Sunday\u2019s runoff against his centre-left rival. Yet by the time he takes office next January, the country will already be implementing the immigration accord agreed with the US by the outgoing president, Jimmy Morales. Asylum seekers. Threatened with sanctions by Trump, Morales agreed to make Guatemala a so-called \u201csafe third country\u201d for asylum seekers, despite its own problems with poverty and violence. The plan is opposed by the vast majority of Guatemalans. Hong Kong airport closed amid massive protests Hong Kong\u2019s airport authority has cancelled departure flights after thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators flooded into one of the world\u2019s busiest air travel hubs holding signs reading \u201cHong Kong is not safe\u201d and \u201cShame on police\u201d. The abrupt shutdown came as street protests across the Chinese territory entered their 10th week with no sign of either side backing down, and the Chinese government signalled its rising anger at the protesters, denouncing some of the violent demonstrations as \u201cterrorism\u201d. Water cannon. In an apparent warning to protesters of the authorities\u2019 toughening approach, Hong Kong police invited legislators and journalists on Monday to witness a display of water cannon. Police have never used the devices since two were bought after pro-democracy protests in 2014, but during Monday\u2019s demonstration one was blasted at dummy targets in a training facility. Russia honours \u2018heroes\u2019 killed in mysterious nuclear accident Russia has honoured five nuclear scientists it described as \u201cnational heroes\u201d with posthumous awards, after they were killed in a mysterious explosion at sea last week. The blast in the White Sea caused a reported spike in radiation in the northern Russian city of Severodvinsk, leading US-based nuclear experts to speculate that it came during tests of a nuclear-powered cruise missile which was hailed by Vladimir Putin last year. Nuclear elite. Valentin Kostyukov, an official from Russia\u2019s state nuclear agency, Rosatom, said the five men \u201cwere the elite of the Russian federal nuclear centre\u201d and died while \u201cperforming the task of national importance\u201d. Crib sheet Five children, aged between eight months and seven years, have been killed in a fire at a daycare centre in Erie, Pennsylvania, where they were staying while their parents worked overnight. Nigel Farage has described Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as \u201cterrifying\u201d and their social justice and environmental campaigns \u201cirrelevant\u201d, in a speech to a rightwing political conference in Australia. New Zealand\u2019s government has bought more than 10,000 firearms since mid-July, as part of a gun buyback scheme introduced in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in March. The wildly successful Korean K-pop boy band BTS are taking an extended hiatus from music, to allow the seven members to \u201cenjoy their normal lives as normal twentysomething young men\u201d, the group\u2019s management agency has announced. Must-reads Joseph Fiennes: \u2018We got lucky with the zeitgeist\u2019 Joseph Fiennes is reluctant to discuss the parallels between the Trump administration and the fictional leadership of Gilead from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, in which he stars as Commander Fred Waterford. \u201cBut somehow you can\u2019t not equate some things,\u201d he tells Zoe Williams. Could the Democrats take Texas? The Lone Star state has been a Republican powerhouse for decades. But with a host of congressional retirements and a demographic shift towards Hispanic voters, Texas is becoming an electoral battleground once more, as Tom Dart reports from Houston. The coalminers rooting for a Green New Deal Many coalminers in Appalachia believed Trump\u2019s 2016 promise to bring back their jobs, but as their industry continues to decline, some are now pinning their hopes on alternative solutions, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, as they explain to Michael Sainato. The magic of the year\u2019s most mind-bending documentary The Amazing Johnathan is dying \u2013 or is he? Compelling and confounding, The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is more a documentary about figuring out what a documentary should be than a profile of the past-his-prime magician from which it takes its name, writes Adrian Horton. Opinion It is strange to recall that Putin started out as an avowedly pro-western leader. Over his 20-year reign, he has responded to foreign criticism of his internal policies by restoring his country as a rival to the west, says Angus Roxburgh. He regards what he does as a mirror image of what the west does to Russia and around the world. Sport Simone Biles has become the first woman in almost 70 years to win six US gymnastics titles, sticking a so-called \u201ctriple-double\u201d in the floor exercise during the weekend\u2019s competition. The 22-year-old is gearing up to defend her Olympic title at the 2020 Games. As he waits out a transfer ban, Chelsea\u2019s coach, Frank Lampard, must rely on the club\u2019s youth team prospects to rise to the challenge of the Premier League.

      "bodyText": "The actor Rose McGowan is to make her directorial debut with a politically charged cartoon feature about dogs. McGowan, who is about to perform in a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival, revealed more details about Pomerania to the Hollywood Reporter. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s about a little dog who hides in the closet, and once she comes out of the closet she becomes the queen of a land called Pomerania,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s at war with Muttlandia, where all the mutts are. So, it\u2019s all about race, breed, classism \u2013 and it\u2019s very funny.\u2019\u2019 In reality, Pomerania is a region straddling Poland and Germany on the shore of the Baltic sea. It is not thought that McGowan\u2019s project has geographical links to the area, but it is likely the canines featured are the spitz breed of toy dog that originated from the region. McGowan was the first person to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, claiming that he raped her at the Sundance film festival in 1997. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. She has since quit acting and says she is unhappy about the lack of support she was offered by the industry. \u2018\u2018People in Hollywood have not been brave enough to step up for me as I stepped up for them,\u201d she told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cBecause I helped to clean out the system and they haven\u2019t been brave in return. So, I do miss performing but I feel like acting is in the past, mostly because of the lack of support that I\u2019ve gotten.\u2019\u2019",

Hesiod lived and farmed at the foot of Mount Helicon, and one day encountered its nine residents, the Muses.

Hesiod had no doubt that truth-telling was superior to lying. But, as Murray asks, are lies (<em>pseudea</em>) falsehoods or just stories, ie fiction?</p> <p>That personal encounter with the Muses and the narrative it inspires is no doubt truth for Hesiod. It\u2019s his allegorical interpretation of the wonderful moments when ideas flow, images brighten and a voice not the writer\u2019s own seems to be speaking. Inspiration: an unfashionable concept, but still a psychological reality.</p> <p>Hesiod receives important gifts from his inspirers: the laurel sceptre and the poetic voice. He acquires both bardic and kingly status. These are not really separate honours, as Thomas Cooke\u2019s translation (lines 12-14) makes clear: the poetic voice itself has been granted highest authority. Hesiod does not of course rival Super-King Zeus (\u201cOlympian Jove\u201d), but he has the right to settle disputes, deliver judgments and write those handbooks on agriculture, social behaviour and economics which are really \u201cmetaphor for didacticism about man\u201d. He is the supreme <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_and_Days\">narrator of the truth</a>.</p> <p>Hesiod is sometimes described as the first poet to have a conscious sense of himself as an individual writer. But it also seems plausible that \u201cHesiod\u201d is a persona. The name Hesiodos means: \u201c<a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5289#rfn5\">He who sends forth the voice</a>.\u201d That naughty brother, Perses, the target of some of Hesiod\u2019s sage advice in Works and Days<em>, </em>could also be a useful fiction.</p> <p>Whether or not \u201cHesiod\u201d is a mask, there\u2019s no doubt about the existence of his 18th-century translator, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cooke_(author)\">Cooke (1703-1756)</a> \u2013 sometimes nicknamed \u201cHesiod\u201d Cooke.

Neither poet seems to have taken Hesiod\u2019s advice, that revenge should be avoided as it hurts the vengeful. And who indeed would want a politically corrected Pope, a ponderous parson of a pontiff without the white-hot sneers? There\u2019s more than one way, after all, to be didactic.</p> <p>I quoted the prose translation above that sent me to Hesiod.

There are certainly some strong descriptive passages in Cooke\u2019s Theogony, not least when he writes about the great Zeus\u2019s thunderstorms. As poetry, Cooke\u2019s couplets are often masterly in their compression, and sometimes energetic, but I think they illustrate why the 18th-century translator\u2019s prosodic choice, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/heroic-couplet-definition-4140168\">the heroic couplet</a>, seems to readers now \u2013 and even to some critics then \u2013 too tight and trite.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.john-uebersax.com/pdf/Hesiod%20-%20Cooke%201743.pdf\">Cooke\u2019s translation</a> was the standard one for years, and it has been significant for later poets.

It added that it had been a victim of sophisticated selling techniques, called \u201cspoofing\u201d and \u201clayering\u201d, to artificially drive down its share price.</p> <p>Muddy Waters issued a brief statement in response, claiming that \u201cthe only manipulation is that of Burford\u2019s return metrics, accounts, and disclosures\u201d.</p> <p>Shares in Burford fell again on Monday, down 5% to 803p, although this is well above the lows of just over 400p seen last week. Since Muddy Waters first revealed its short position in Burford last Wednesday \u2013 and alleged that Burford was a \u201cpoor business masquerading as a great one\u201d \u2013 the company\u2019s stock market value has collapsed by more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>In the first evidence of regulatory involvement, the Financial Conduct Authority said it had a duty to undertake inquiries into manipulative behaviour and other market abuses.</p> <p>\u201cThe FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging inquiries. We will continue to make inquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <p>The collapse in Burford\u2019s share price is further bad news for long-suffering investors in the former star manager Neil Woodford\u2019s funds.

      "bodyText": "The City regulator has begun \u201cwide-ranging inquiries\u201d following the US hedge fund Muddy Waters\u2019 attack on the UK-listed Burford Capital last week that sent its shares plummeting by 65% in 24 hours. In what is fast becoming one of the most extraordinary financial battles in recent years, Muddy Waters \u2013 a so-called short seller, which makes money when share prices fall \u2013 made a string of accounting and poor management allegations against Burford, a business that specialises in providing funding for lawsuits. Burford hit back on Monday with a detailed analysis of what it said was \u201cevidence consistent with illegal market manipulation\u201d and said it had informed both regulators and \u201ccriminal prosecutors\u201d. It added that it had been a victim of sophisticated selling techniques, called \u201cspoofing\u201d and \u201clayering\u201d, to artificially drive down its share price. Muddy Waters issued a brief statement in response, claiming that \u201cthe only manipulation is that of Burford\u2019s return metrics, accounts, and disclosures\u201d. Shares in Burford fell again on Monday, down 5% to 803p, although this is well above the lows of just over 400p seen last week. Since Muddy Waters first revealed its short position in Burford last Wednesday \u2013 and alleged that Burford was a \u201cpoor business masquerading as a great one\u201d \u2013 the company\u2019s stock market value has collapsed by more than \u00a31bn. In the first evidence of regulatory involvement, the Financial Conduct Authority said it had a duty to undertake inquiries into manipulative behaviour and other market abuses. \u201cThe FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging inquiries. We will continue to make inquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal,\u201d it said in a statement. The collapse in Burford\u2019s share price is further bad news for long-suffering investors in the former star manager Neil Woodford\u2019s funds. Woodford holds a 7% stake in Burford, although the rise in its share price prior to Muddy Waters\u2019 allegations was so meteoric \u2013 it jumped from \u00a32 to \u00a320 a share between 2016 and 2018 \u2013 that it\u2019s likely that Woodford investors are still ahead. In its analysis of trading in its stock, Burford said it had discovered \u201ctrading activity consistent with material illegal activity\u201d, although it did not specifically accuse Muddy Waters. It said it had spotted large amounts of spoofing activity in its stock. Spoofing is a controversial practice in which a dealer makes a huge number of trading orders at a price equal to or better than other market participants. These orders are subsequently cancelled, having the effect of artificially depressing the price of a share without any trades being concluded. Burford said: \u201cOn 6 August, in the several hours following the 13:30 release of the Muddy Waters tweet about a forthcoming short attack, almost \u00a390m of sell orders were placed and cancelled without being filled \u2013 for a stock whose average trading volume for an entire day was less than one-fifth that amount. That trading conduct is consistent with illegal market manipulation. \u201cMoreover, during five one-minute periods on 6 August, Burford\u2019s shares fell 6%, or over \u00a3170m in value, some of its sharpest declines of the day. During these periods, executed sell orders totalled a mere \u00a3186,000. That mismatch between price movement and executed orders is consistent with market manipulation.\u201d But Muddy Waters disputes the allegation. It suggests that spoofing is a tactic used by high-frequency, computer-driven trading firms and is not a practice used by the hedge fund, which it said takes concentrated positions. It has also emerged that another US hedge fund, Gotham City Capital, raised concerns about Burford Capital before last week\u2019s allegations from Muddy Waters. Gotham founder Daniel Yu also launched a passionate defence of short selling in an open letter to Burford. \u201cActivist short sellers are profiteers, but so are litigation financiers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJust because a profit motive drives both short selling and litigation finance, it does not mean there are no public benefits resulting from both activities. \u201cI believe that activist short sellers throughout history have furthered justice by providing the public with new and often contrarian opinions and facts \u2013 usually at significant personal, reputational, legal and financial risk \u2013 information that the public would otherwise not be privy to.\u201d",

In Britain, such figures serve to boost police budgets, stir fear and anti-immigrant hate and lead to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/14/england-and-wales-has-highest-imprisonment-rate-in-western-europe\" title=\"\">highest incarceration rate</a> in western Europe. They have nothing to do with crime. As proper statisticians know, police-recorded crime is about police activity and a propensity to report. Hence currently \u201csoaring\u201d historic sex crime.</p> <p>The only reliable figures are from the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Survey_for_England_and_Wales\" title=\"\">Crime Survey for England and Wales</a> (there are separate ones for Scotland and Northern Ireland), which receive no publicity as they have been falling for a quarter of a century, probably as the nation prospers.</p> <p>Where there appears to have been a genuine <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44397532\" title=\"\">increase is in violent crime</a> related to the illicit drugs industry, to \u201ccounty lines\u201d dealing networks and the growth of gangs. Yet the government of which Johnson is now leader has spent a decade cutting back on rehabilitation and probation, and starving anti-gang youth support. Prison conditions are reportedly deteriorating almost by the week. Theresa May stymied efforts to cut incarceration rates. Through all this, the key dysfunction underlying a significant amount of serious crime, the illegality of recreational drugs, is effectively \u201csponsored\u201d by Home Office primitivism. The hottest spots for drug use are the government\u2019s own jails, which the prime minister wants to expand.</p> <p>Criminology libraries groan with evidence rejecting the idea that longer sentences, more imprisonment, more police and tougher stop-and-search bring down crime. They are a return to the dark ages. The causes of crime in Britain lie embedded in the social economy. They lie in stupid and unenforceable laws and, nowadays, in the inadequate regulation of the internet. The answers lie in tedious and unspectacular remedies, such as school and community institutions, in the design of cities and the care of vulnerable families.</p> <p>Britain is not a crime-ridden country and it is cynical hypocrisy to maintain otherwise. Johnson is about to become surely the first prime minister in modern history to needlessly inflict a crushing economic sanction on his own country \u2013 purely to help him win his party leadership. He should at least concentrate on mitigating that blow, not on populist electioneering.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The most pressing issue facing Britain this month is not its falling crime rate. Yes, that reads falling crime rate \u2013 it has, indeed, been falling since 1995. The trouble is that it is not falling faster than Boris Johnson\u2019s electoral prospects. Hence a month-long blitz of headline-seeking announcements on \u201cfighting crime\u201d. We have had 20,000 more police, 10,000 more prison places, enhanced powers of stop-and-search and convicts to get \u201cthe sentences they deserve\u201d \u2013 a concept of Trumpian fatuity. The much-trumpeted idea that Johnson is some sort of Tory liberal in disguise is ridiculous. Any cynical politician can trawl through what are called \u201cpolice-recorded crime statistics\u201d and find a few to suit the macho moment. In Britain, such figures serve to boost police budgets, stir fear and anti-immigrant hate and lead to the highest incarceration rate in western Europe. They have nothing to do with crime. As proper statisticians know, police-recorded crime is about police activity and a propensity to report. Hence currently \u201csoaring\u201d historic sex crime. The only reliable figures are from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (there are separate ones for Scotland and Northern Ireland), which receive no publicity as they have been falling for a quarter of a century, probably as the nation prospers. Where there appears to have been a genuine increase is in violent crime related to the illicit drugs industry, to \u201ccounty lines\u201d dealing networks and the growth of gangs. Yet the government of which Johnson is now leader has spent a decade cutting back on rehabilitation and probation, and starving anti-gang youth support. Prison conditions are reportedly deteriorating almost by the week. Theresa May stymied efforts to cut incarceration rates. Through all this, the key dysfunction underlying a significant amount of serious crime, the illegality of recreational drugs, is effectively \u201csponsored\u201d by Home Office primitivism. The hottest spots for drug use are the government\u2019s own jails, which the prime minister wants to expand. Criminology libraries groan with evidence rejecting the idea that longer sentences, more imprisonment, more police and tougher stop-and-search bring down crime. They are a return to the dark ages. The causes of crime in Britain lie embedded in the social economy. They lie in stupid and unenforceable laws and, nowadays, in the inadequate regulation of the internet. The answers lie in tedious and unspectacular remedies, such as school and community institutions, in the design of cities and the care of vulnerable families. Britain is not a crime-ridden country and it is cynical hypocrisy to maintain otherwise. Johnson is about to become surely the first prime minister in modern history to needlessly inflict a crushing economic sanction on his own country \u2013 purely to help him win his party leadership. He should at least concentrate on mitigating that blow, not on populist electioneering. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

His lead foreign policy adviser is Antony Blinken, a former Obama official<strong> </strong>who pushed for Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/tony-blinkens-star-turn-096847\">Libya intervention</a> and served as deputy secretary of state at the beginning of the US support for the Saudi/UAE war in Yemen. Biden\u2019s speech hit on a few <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/7/11/20690243/joe-biden-foreign-policy-speech-new-york-trump\">fairly conventional themes</a> about the need to \u201creassert American leadership\u201d, the need to return to American values, and the importance of allies in the face of a rising China. He hinted at more left-leaning goals, like ending the war in Afghanistan, but suggested a smaller deployment would remain to fight terrorism. Mostly, the speech was an attempt at resetting America\u2019s foreign policy to a pre-Trump time.</p> <p>Harris hasn\u2019t given a speech; at campaign stops she has consistently said that foreign policy should not be driven by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/21/politics/kamala-harris-foreign-policy-tweet-trump/index.html\">tweet</a> \u2013 a critique of process. She has also criticized Trump for being soft on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1145368179864231936\">North Korea</a>. Her personal hires reflect <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/meet-maya-harris-hillary-clintons-progressive-link\">her connections</a> to Hillary Clinton; her team includes the former undersecretary of defense <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-defense/2016/11/hillary-clintons-defense-secretary-in-waiting-217183\">Michele Flourny</a> \u2013 who was touted as the possible first female secretary of defense should Clinton have won in 2016 \u2013 and Phillip Gordon, a highly active former state department and later White House official who was involved in the Iran<strong> </strong>negotiations.

His foreign policy speech emphasized a technology-driven imagining of what America needs to be in <a href=\"https://peteforamerica.com/national-security-for-a-new-era/\">2054</a>, while maintaining a slimmed-down American exceptionalism. His speech offered few actual policy proposals<strong> </strong>beyond withdrawing<strong> </strong>major military forces from Afghanistan while maintaining counter-terror and intelligence forces there. He also suggested reviving Obama-era accords that Trump has unilaterally discarded.</p> <p>As a senator, Warren has mostly focused on finance, which was reflected in a speech she gave at American University last year.

As a House member he voted against the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-revisits-vote-against-iraq-war-16th-anniversary-invasion-2019-3\">war in Iraq</a> and as a mayor in Burlington <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/us/bernie-sanders.html\">spoke out</a> against cold war policies.

      "bodyText": "In the example clues below, I explain the two parts of each: the definition of the answer, given in bold type, and the wordplay \u2013 the recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, of course, you also have the crossing letters, which will greatly alleviate your solving load if you have them. The explanations contain links to previous entries in this series on such matters as spelling one word backwards to reveal another. And setters\u2019 names tend to link to interviews, in case you feel like getting to know these people better. Cryptic clues are riddled with abbreviations: \u201chour\u201d indicating an H in the answer, \u201csecond\u201d an S, and so on. Many of them are nice and easy to spot. If you see \u201cnorth\u201d in the clue, get ready to write an N somewhere in the answer; the same goes for \u201cnorth-west\u201d and NW \u2026 \u2026 but there are some, well, more advanced tricks worth knowing. E There exist other, more poetic, ways of referring to, say, the east. Here\u2019s Rufus: 26d Travel free over the Orient (4) [ wordplay: synonym for \u2018free\u2019 (as a verb) + abbrev. for \u2018Orient\u2019 ] [ RID + E ] [ definition: travel ] It\u2019s a down clue, so that word for \u201cfree\u201d (as in \u201cTrump vows to rid US of \u2018bad hombres\u2019\u201d) goes \u201cover\u201d the E for Orient, delivering us a RIDE. (Both words, incidentally, allude to what happens in that direction: dawn (\u201ceast\u201d) and rising (\u201corient\u201d).) SE SE is not always handed to us on a plate with the phrase \u201csouth-east\u201d. Sometimes, the setter will allude to somewhere in the south-east of the UK. Rufus again: 11ac House in the home counties by the motorway (4) [ wordplay: abbrev. for home counties + abbrev. (more or less) for a motorway ] [ SE + M1 ] [ definition: house ] Since we don\u2019t enter letters, M1 becomes MI and we get our SEMI. A setter might also use the name of one of the relevant counties. Outside of crosswording, some joyless types try to restrict the inherently vague \u201chome counties\u201d to Middlesex, Essex, Kent and Surrey, because they\u2019re the ones which buffet London; we need only keep an eye out for anything that might be turned into \u201csouth-east\u201d (even \u201cBerkshire\u201d) and then to SE. NE This one shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Here\u2019s Paul (in his Mudd incarnation): 24ac Excitable thing taking new money to Newcastle? (7) [ wordplay: abbrev. for \u2018new\u2019 + a currency (\u2018money\u2019) + abbrev. indicating \u2018Newcastle\u2019 ] [ N + EURO + NE ] [ definition: excitable thing ] In the end, the \u201cexcitable thing\u201d is not a person but a NEURONE. Lest you\u2019re tempted to complain that the north-east of the country contains Wick, Thurso and John O\u2019Groats rather than Newcastle, the Newcastle postcode area uses NE, so solvers are free of English chauvinism. Even when they use \u201cTyneside\u201d or \u201cGeordies\u201d. SW1 Talking of postcodes, is it London-centric to assume that solvers will know the capital\u2019s postcodes? Not if they\u2019re the ones you\u2019d use to write to the Queen or the prime minister. Here\u2019s Crucible: 3d Flyer in posh part of London paper (5) [ wordplay: postcode for a posh part of London + abbrev. for a newspaper title ] [ SW1 + abbrev. for Financial Times ] [ definition: flyer ] Again, we turn the 1 into an I; again, the definition is misleading and the flyer is not paper but a bird: the SWIFT. \u201cWestminster\u201d, \u201cBelgravia\u201d, even \u201cVictoria\u201d may indicate an SWI in your answer. EC Finally, we\u2019ve mentioned this abbreviation before, but it bears repeating because of its colossal potential for misdirection. Orlando does just that: 16d A northern city shows excessive affection for tales (9) [ wordplay: A (\u2018A\u2019) + abbrev. for \u2018northern\u2019 + abbrev. for \u2018city\u2019 + synonym for \u2018shows excessive affection\u2019 ] [ A + N + EC + DOTES ] [ definition: tales ] In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter which part of the country we\u2019ve been thinking about: \u2018city\u2019, as it so often does, denotes EC via the City of London and the answer is ANECDOTES.

Those shareholders that have remained with Thomas Cook are expected to have the value of their shares \u201csignificantly diluted\u201d by the bailout. They include Marathon Asset Management, Jupiter Asset Management and Neset Kockar, a Turkish tourism entrepreneur. Kockar has built up an 8% stake in the business, boosting the shares before Monday\u2019s announcement. He demanded last week that he be involved in the turnaround talks. Under the terms of the proposed deal, about \u00a31.7bn in debt will be converted to equity alongside the \u00a3900m cash injection in order to help pay down the company\u2019s \u00a31.2bn in net debt reported at the end of March. Fosun has yet to decide on any reorganisation of the tour operator\u2019s business, prompting concern about the future of the 21,000-member workforce. The company has 563 high street branches in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "British diplomats will pull out from the EU\u2019s institutional structures of power in Brussels within days, under plans being drawn up by Downing Street. In an attempt to reinforce the message that the UK is leaving the EU by 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d, the UK will stop attending the day-to-day meetings that inform the bloc\u2019s decision-making. The move under discussion is said by UK officials to be in line with Boris Johnson\u2019s first statement in the House of Commons, in which he said he would \u201cunshackle\u201d British diplomacy from EU affairs. Critics have countered that the symbolic walkout would merely leave the UK blindsided on decisions and ultimately damage the national interest. EU working group meetings at which British diplomats were expected to take their seats alongside the other 27 member states will deal with issues on security, the pan-European response to any future crises involving civilians, foreign affairs and the protection of consumers interests. It is unclear how far the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU structures would go before 31 October, and whether ministers or the UK\u2019s permanent representative in the EU would ultimately fail to show up for meetings in September and October. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he would attend a meeting of his EU counterparts at the end of August in Helsinki. Luisa Porritt MEP, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European parliament, said: \u201cBoris Johnson is unnecessarily sabotaging British influence in Europe. \u201cHaughty grandstanding like this undermines our place in the world and will be treated as a snub by our European neighbours and allies, who we should be working with to address shared challenges. \u201cMargaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill would be appalled by this short-sightedness. We should be leading in Europe, not undermining our own interests. \u201cTo be outside the room while our shared security interests are being discussed shows weakness and pettiness, not strength. Brexit is not inevitable; this national humiliation must end alongside this rotten Conservative government.\u201d There are about 150 diplomats in the UK\u2019s permanent representation in Brussels lobbying for British interests during the drafting of EU positions and regulations. Far from being keen to abandon the field in Brussels, Theresa May\u2019s government had been looking at how to maintain ways into the EU\u2019s institutions in order to influence events from outside. But in his statement to the Commons on becoming prime minister, Johnson had said that both sides needed to recognise the \u201creality\u201d that the UK\u2019s \u201cnational participation in the European union\u201d was coming to an end. The prime minister claimed there were \u201cvery many brilliant officials trapped in meeting after meeting in Brussels and Luxembourg when they could be better deploying their talents in preparing to pioneer new trade deals and promoting a truly global Britain\u201d. While the UK has not played its usual full role in meetings in areas on the future of the EU, including in discussions on the bloc\u2019s budget, it has been an active player in other fields such as foreign affairs since the Brexit referendum in 2016. EU diplomats said they would regret any decision by the British government to prematurely leave the Brussels institutions where the UK diplomats have built up a strong reputation. \u201cThey were once the most respected diplomatic corps here,\u201d one said. \u201cThat was diminished during David Cameron\u2019s government but the UK representative\u2019s position was always important. Even in areas where the UK did not have a strong national stance, they would have ideas to solve a problem.\u201d Paul Adamson, a visiting professor at the Policy Institute, King\u2019s College London, said the UK government would need to build up its embassy in Brussels after Brexit. He said: \u201cOne of the many ironies of Brexit is that the UK government will have to significantly increase its diplomatic presence in Brussels - as well as in key EU capitals - both to find out what is going on in meetings from which it will be excluded but also to try to influence the direction of EU policy making. Brussels decisions will continue to impact the UK. \u201c[The government] and its agencies will have to invest heavily in public diplomacy to repair alliances and to forge new ones.

Long lost friends hug it out on verdant trail paths. On the Story Time stage, struggling jugglers drop balls and acrobats miss their cues.

      "body": "<p>T\u00e9a Obreht\u2019s wildly successful first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/20/obreht-winman-debut-fiction-reviews\" title=\"\"><em>The Tiger\u2019s Wife</em></a>, was a tale of exuberant surrealist allegory. Its framing device was the dialogue between Natalia, a young doctor, and her storytelling grandfather, as they chewed over the history of an unnamed Balkan state. Obreht left Serbia as a child when the Yugoslav wars broke out and moved to the US as a young woman, but her debut still came firmly out of the tradition of European magic-realism, incorporating folk tales and ghost stories into a narrative that was both fantastical and moving, an intergenerational excavation of the ground where the personal and political meet.</p> <p>Six years later, her second novel appears at first a wholly different proposition. Lurie Mattie is an orphan forced to fend for himself in dangerous times \u2013 the wild west. He falls in with a rough crowd and becomes a thief, then a murderer. He\u2019s sought by a dogged lawman and flees across the (not yet) United States of the mid-19th century. His story is intercut with that of Nora Lark, an Arizona farm wife in the early 1890s whose husband has disappeared in search of water. The historical detail is immaculate, the landscape exquisitely drawn; the prose is hard, muscular, more convincingly Cormac McCarthy than McCarthy himself. If the western is the tale that America tells about itself, then this is an attempt to write a new chapter in that story.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just a western, though. Lurie, Obreht\u2019s hero, was born the son of an immigrant: Hadziosman Djuric of Mostar. Lurie is orphaned young and apprenticed to a graverobber. The spark of the best historical fiction comes when the imagined world collides with the real; here, Obreht trawls up the fascinating history of the US camel corps, a short-lived attempt by the military to employ camels in the arid reaches of the south-west. Hi Jolly (AKA Hadji Ali), a Turk of Syrian descent who was one of the first camel drivers employed by the army, is among an array of figures who lived in the factual past but are reanimated by their interaction with the fictional Lurie.</p> <p>That a good chunk of the novel is dictated by Lurie to his camel, Burke, isn\u2019t the most outlandish thing about it. As people die around Lurie, he begins to experience \u201cthis strange feeling at the edges of myself \u2013 this want\u201d. We understand that he is somehow possessed by the ghosts of those he kills, who \u201cbind me up in the sorrows of all the things [they] hadn\u2019t lived to do\u201d. Nora, increasingly convinced that her husband will not return, retreats from her living sons and speaks instead to her long-dead daughter, Evelyn, \u201csundrowned\u201d as a baby.

      "bodyText": "T\u00e9a Obreht\u2019s wildly successful first novel, The Tiger\u2019s Wife, was a tale of exuberant surrealist allegory. Its framing device was the dialogue between Natalia, a young doctor, and her storytelling grandfather, as they chewed over the history of an unnamed Balkan state. Obreht left Serbia as a child when the Yugoslav wars broke out and moved to the US as a young woman, but her debut still came firmly out of the tradition of European magic-realism, incorporating folk tales and ghost stories into a narrative that was both fantastical and moving, an intergenerational excavation of the ground where the personal and political meet. Six years later, her second novel appears at first a wholly different proposition. Lurie Mattie is an orphan forced to fend for himself in dangerous times \u2013 the wild west. He falls in with a rough crowd and becomes a thief, then a murderer. He\u2019s sought by a dogged lawman and flees across the (not yet) United States of the mid-19th century. His story is intercut with that of Nora Lark, an Arizona farm wife in the early 1890s whose husband has disappeared in search of water. The historical detail is immaculate, the landscape exquisitely drawn; the prose is hard, muscular, more convincingly Cormac McCarthy than McCarthy himself. If the western is the tale that America tells about itself, then this is an attempt to write a new chapter in that story. This isn\u2019t just a western, though. Lurie, Obreht\u2019s hero, was born the son of an immigrant: Hadziosman Djuric of Mostar. Lurie is orphaned young and apprenticed to a graverobber. The spark of the best historical fiction comes when the imagined world collides with the real; here, Obreht trawls up the fascinating history of the US camel corps, a short-lived attempt by the military to employ camels in the arid reaches of the south-west. Hi Jolly (AKA Hadji Ali), a Turk of Syrian descent who was one of the first camel drivers employed by the army, is among an array of figures who lived in the factual past but are reanimated by their interaction with the fictional Lurie. That a good chunk of the novel is dictated by Lurie to his camel, Burke, isn\u2019t the most outlandish thing about it. As people die around Lurie, he begins to experience \u201cthis strange feeling at the edges of myself \u2013 this want\u201d. We understand that he is somehow possessed by the ghosts of those he kills, who \u201cbind me up in the sorrows of all the things [they] hadn\u2019t lived to do\u201d. Nora, increasingly convinced that her husband will not return, retreats from her living sons and speaks instead to her long-dead daughter, Evelyn, \u201csundrowned\u201d as a baby. At the same time, her husband\u2019s cousin, Josie, who lives with them, is the local medium, hosting seances to communicate with the dead, whom she calls \u201cthe other livin\u2019\u201d. This paranormal element reminds us strongly of George Saunders\u2019s Lincoln in the Bardo. Not only the porousness of the veil separating the living from the dead, but also the carnivalesque way in which the dead perform their vices through the living, the humour and pathos that come together in this presentation of the afterlife. Inland also feels of a piece with another recent novel, Sarah Perry\u2019s Melmoth, a brilliantly eerie gothic tale in which the horrors of history are condensed into a single ghostly figure. Obreht\u2019s novel similarly explores the brutality and darkness that lurk beneath the veneer of the American dream. There\u2019s a different kind of haunting going on here, too. Jacques Derrida coined the term hauntology to mark the ghostly presence of historical texts in contemporary literature.

When a health visitor told her that her three-year-old girl was \u201con the chubby side\u201d, Begum was surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she was at all; I had felt like my children weren\u2019t eating enough.\u201d</p> <p>She did, however, accept an invitation to join a six-week healthy parenting programme called <a href=\"https://www.henry.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Henry</a>. Four weeks in, she has rebooted her family\u2019s lifestyle, from making dinner times earlier to allow for more activity before bed to the food she prepares. Coming from an Asian background, says Begum, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fatty food \u2013 we use a lot of oil and salt in curries.\u201d Her children also loved drinking juice and snacking on crisps and chocolate after school. \u201cI would just allow them,\u201d she says, incredulously. \u201cI thought it was normal.\u201d</p> <p>In following her health visitor\u2019s advice, however, Begum is in a minority. Just one-third of parents who are informed that their child is overweight or obese accept any help offered to them. Peyman\u00e9 Adab, a professor of chronic disease epidemiology and public health at the University of Birmingham, has been developing obesity prevention and management programmes for nearly 20 years, including studying parental responses. \u201cThere is definitely underrecognition of obesity,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of it is that we base our judgment on what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s around us, and as more children become obese and overweight you compare and say: \u2018My child isn\u2019t <em>that</em> overweight.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, less than <a href=\"https://adc.bmj.com/content/90/10/999\" title=\"\">2% of those aged five to </a><a href=\"https://adc.bmj.com/content/90/10/999\" title=\"\">10 were obese</a>. These days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/26/fewer-obese-children-starting-school-but-third-leave-overweight\" title=\"\">one-third of children</a> are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, yet many adults don\u2019t see the problem. A 2014 study in the British Journal of General Practice found that <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/65/633/e234\" title=\"\">parents don\u2019t tend to class their children as overweight until they are in the 99.7th centile</a>, which is morbidly obese.</p> <p>\u201cSome parents don\u2019t think children can be overweight,\u201d says Adab. \u201cThey talk about puppy fat, and they think the children will grow out of it. They don\u2019t see it as something that becomes established \u2013 and yet the evidence is that it does track through [into adulthood].\u201d </p> <p>While every child develops differently, healthy puppy fat generally ends with toddlerhood. The critical periods are around ages five and six and again around puberty when, says Adab, there is a tendency for weight gain and \u201cperhaps we should be intervening more\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b8df69a9d1ddd7add21b78e31f2f2c40e20cf06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b8df69a9d1ddd7add21b78e31f2f2c40e20cf06/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cooking together can help make healthy habits fun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooking together can help make healthy habits fun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Halfpoint/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From age three and up, the main way parents are informed that their children are overweight is through the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), which registers children\u2019s body mass index (BMI), once at four or five and again at 10 or 11. But BMI, a calculation based on weight and height, has limitations \u2013 for instance, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-018-0279-7\" title=\"\">it underestimates</a> body fat in south Asian children (the demographic with the highest levels of childhood obesity) and overestimates it in black children.</p> <p>Another problem with the NCMP is there is no hard and fast procedure on informing parents of the result \u2013 it was set up to monitor trends, not as a screening strategy. \u201cSome local authorities contact families of the children who were overweight and try to get them to engage in services; some don\u2019t do anything other than send a letter,\u201d says Adab. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the best approach is.\u201d Many simply don\u2019t trust the figures. \u201cEven colleagues here, working in academia, have said they\u2019ve binned that letter because they think it\u2019s rubbish.\u201d</p> <p>Attempts have been made to word the notification differently, to little effect. \u201cIt\u2019s an impenetrable problem,\u201d says Adab \u2013 and it is exacerbated by our sugar-coated and deep-fried food culture. Her daughter was given chocolate by teachers as a reward. \u201cI was part of our parent-teacher group and remember trying to speak up, saying maybe we shouldn\u2019t have so many sweets,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAll the parents thought I was from another planet.\u201d </p> <p>At least in primary school, there is some control over what children eat; the newfound autonomy of starting secondary school \u2013 and the sweet shops and fried chicken joints that come with it \u2013 poses the greatest challenge. Taste preferences are formed in early life: even exposure to flavours in the womb influences later habits, while sugar \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/nicole_avena_how_sugar_affects_the_brain\" title=\"\">separate to weight gain</a> \u2013 conditions our brains to crave ever-bigger sweet fixes. \u201cFrom a young age we can start getting children used to less sugar and less fat,\u201d says Dr Angela Donin of the Population Health Research Institute at St George\u2019s, University of London. \u201cIf they\u2019re more used to snacking on savoury crackers that are high in oats or bran, and fruit and nuts, that will hopefully shape their preferences.\u201d</p> <p>Donin\u2019s research has found that having a large breakfast every day, particularly a high-fibre cereal, is associated with lower adiposity. But swapping that in for sugary cereals can be difficult, not least because even plain old bran flakes are usually at least 10% sugar \u2013 you still have to read the labels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a575694d7fe2514a6c449b8f0191aad50ee0a956\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a575694d7fe2514a6c449b8f0191aad50ee0a956/0_220_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Presentation works wonders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Presentation works wonders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ThitareeSarmkasat/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is very difficult, once taste preferences have been formed, to try to change those as a parent, but take small steps to start with and try to ensure your child has a high-fibre breakfast every day with reduced sugar,\u201d says Donin. \u201cMake sure they\u2019re having enough sleep, cut back on those sugary drinks and free sugars [added sugars and those in honey, syrup and fruit juice], and think about healthy snacks that will increase their fibre and micronutrient intake.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017 Zoe Willman, who lives in Sheffield, sought help to persuade her two young sons, who have autism, to eat anything other than chicken nuggets and potato faces. \u201cMy eldest would eat cucumber, but apart from that vegetables were a no-go, and I was really worried they weren\u2019t getting what they needed.\u201d After a year working with a Henry volunteer, \u201cNow we\u2019re on fish,\u201d she says proudly. Simple changes such as making shapes out of food and reward charts for trying something new have worked wonders. A healthier diet seems to have changed Willman\u2019s children\u2019s behaviour for the better \u2013 \u201cThere are more calm moments now\u201d \u2013 and she herself has shed several stones.</p> <p>Begum was also pleasantly surprised by the Henry programme\u2019s help in introducing healthy snacks to her family. She says it taught her simple presentation tactics, such as making carrot sticks, which are pleasing to children\u2019s palates. \u201cI peel and slice apples and then they\u2019ll eat them. They love carrot and cucumber sticks with hummus now. Giving them a packet of crisps is easier than having to peel and cut fruit, but my kids really love it \u2013 and vegetables. It is expensive to buy, rather than the fatty stuff, so I\u2019m careful not to waste it, freezing vegetable portions for dinners.\u201d</p> <p>For parents who are anxious about their children becoming obese, the temptation can be to restrict certain foods and stress the terrible consequences of eating them \u2013 but this approach comes with its own concerns about instilling complexes. \u201cIt is a difficult balance, but I don\u2019t think we should be saying there are taboo foods that we shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d says Adab. \u201cThat extreme has definitely been shown to lead to problems. It\u2019s fine to have sweets on occasion but it should be no more than once a week. Every day we drink water rather than fizzy drinks.\u201d But this isn\u2019t easy, she says, and there needs to be a bigger buy-in from schools and parents. \u201cIf it became the norm it would be different.\u201d</p> <p>Given the temptation-laden world we inhabit, will trying to limit access to unhealthy snacks encourage children to binge on them when they get the opportunity? Adab says there isn\u2019t a scientific consensus as to whether restriction leads to weight gain. \u201cSome studies do find an association, but we recently completed a study and found there isn\u2019t an association when you adjust for children\u2019s weight at the start. It could be that parents are restricting because their child is overweight, rather than the restricting causing the weight.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f953501ef0a72702e7d5543fcc90d66d017315\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f953501ef0a72702e7d5543fcc90d66d017315/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eating together around a table is important.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eating together around a table is important.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monkey Business Images/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zeroing in on weight and size, however, is psychologically unhelpful. Many professionals now emphasise positive, healthy living. \u201cThere is very little evidence that weight management programmes lead to unhealthy behaviours,\u201d says Adab, \u201cbut there is always a concern that children will slip into eating disorders. It is still an area that is underresearched, but on the whole most weight management programmes don\u2019t result in unhealthy behaviour if they are done properly.\u201d</p> <p> The trend now is for weight management programmes to call themselves healthy lifestyle programmes, incorporating increased activity, prioritised sleep and limited time on devices into daily routines. \u201cProviding hands-on activities rather than didactic stuff improves uptake and retention,\u201d says Adab. Donin says that the Child Heart and Health Study in England (Chase) of about 5,000 children aged nine to 10 found lower screen time was linked with a lower fat mass index. </p> <p>Stephanie Byrne, a Henry practitioner who works in Lambeth, south London, says she tends not to mention weight at all: \u201cIt\u2019s more about looking at the whole lifestyle of the family and getting people to identify where they want to make changes.\u201d Rather than going on a diet, families might decide to buy a dining table. \u201cWe talk about eating slowly with other people, regular meals, portion size, not snacking all the time, turning the TV off, talking to children and giving them lots of praise and rewards. The evidence shows that is the best way to tackle childhood obesity and being overweight.\u201d</p> <p>Begum has picked up ideas for how to make being healthy fun, from involving the children in cooking to creating a lucky-dip jar of activity options. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the difference in the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to struggle to get them to bed but now they get tired. Before, I just didn\u2019t think about healthiness.\u201d</p>",

Peyman\u00e9 Adab, a professor of chronic disease epidemiology and public health at the University of Birmingham, has been developing obesity prevention and management programmes for nearly 20 years, including studying parental responses. \u201cThere is definitely underrecognition of obesity,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of it is that we base our judgment on what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s around us, and as more children become obese and overweight you compare and say: \u2018My child isn\u2019t that overweight.\u2019\u201d In the 1980s, less than 2% of those aged five to 10 were obese. These days, one-third of children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, yet many adults don\u2019t see the problem. A 2014 study in the British Journal of General Practice found that parents don\u2019t tend to class their children as overweight until they are in the 99.7th centile, which is morbidly obese. \u201cSome parents don\u2019t think children can be overweight,\u201d says Adab. \u201cThey talk about puppy fat, and they think the children will grow out of it. They don\u2019t see it as something that becomes established \u2013 and yet the evidence is that it does track through [into adulthood].\u201d While every child develops differently, healthy puppy fat generally ends with toddlerhood. The critical periods are around ages five and six and again around puberty when, says Adab, there is a tendency for weight gain and \u201cperhaps we should be intervening more\u201d. From age three and up, the main way parents are informed that their children are overweight is through the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), which registers children\u2019s body mass index (BMI), once at four or five and again at 10 or 11. But BMI, a calculation based on weight and height, has limitations \u2013 for instance, it underestimates body fat in south Asian children (the demographic with the highest levels of childhood obesity) and overestimates it in black children. Another problem with the NCMP is there is no hard and fast procedure on informing parents of the result \u2013 it was set up to monitor trends, not as a screening strategy. \u201cSome local authorities contact families of the children who were overweight and try to get them to engage in services; some don\u2019t do anything other than send a letter,\u201d says Adab. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the best approach is.\u201d Many simply don\u2019t trust the figures. \u201cEven colleagues here, working in academia, have said they\u2019ve binned that letter because they think it\u2019s rubbish.\u201d Attempts have been made to word the notification differently, to little effect. \u201cIt\u2019s an impenetrable problem,\u201d says Adab \u2013 and it is exacerbated by our sugar-coated and deep-fried food culture. Her daughter was given chocolate by teachers as a reward. \u201cI was part of our parent-teacher group and remember trying to speak up, saying maybe we shouldn\u2019t have so many sweets,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAll the parents thought I was from another planet.\u201d At least in primary school, there is some control over what children eat; the newfound autonomy of starting secondary school \u2013 and the sweet shops and fried chicken joints that come with it \u2013 poses the greatest challenge. Taste preferences are formed in early life: even exposure to flavours in the womb influences later habits, while sugar \u2013 separate to weight gain \u2013 conditions our brains to crave ever-bigger sweet fixes. \u201cFrom a young age we can start getting children used to less sugar and less fat,\u201d says Dr Angela Donin of the Population Health Research Institute at St George\u2019s, University of London. \u201cIf they\u2019re more used to snacking on savoury crackers that are high in oats or bran, and fruit and nuts, that will hopefully shape their preferences.\u201d Donin\u2019s research has found that having a large breakfast every day, particularly a high-fibre cereal, is associated with lower adiposity. But swapping that in for sugary cereals can be difficult, not least because even plain old bran flakes are usually at least 10% sugar \u2013 you still have to read the labels. \u201cIt is very difficult, once taste preferences have been formed, to try to change those as a parent, but take small steps to start with and try to ensure your child has a high-fibre breakfast every day with reduced sugar,\u201d says Donin. \u201cMake sure they\u2019re having enough sleep, cut back on those sugary drinks and free sugars [added sugars and those in honey, syrup and fruit juice], and think about healthy snacks that will increase their fibre and micronutrient intake.\u201d In 2017 Zoe Willman, who lives in Sheffield, sought help to persuade her two young sons, who have autism, to eat anything other than chicken nuggets and potato faces. \u201cMy eldest would eat cucumber, but apart from that vegetables were a no-go, and I was really worried they weren\u2019t getting what they needed.\u201d After a year working with a Henry volunteer, \u201cNow we\u2019re on fish,\u201d she says proudly. Simple changes such as making shapes out of food and reward charts for trying something new have worked wonders. A healthier diet seems to have changed Willman\u2019s children\u2019s behaviour for the better \u2013 \u201cThere are more calm moments now\u201d \u2013 and she herself has shed several stones. Begum was also pleasantly surprised by the Henry programme\u2019s help in introducing healthy snacks to her family. She says it taught her simple presentation tactics, such as making carrot sticks, which are pleasing to children\u2019s palates. \u201cI peel and slice apples and then they\u2019ll eat them. They love carrot and cucumber sticks with hummus now. Giving them a packet of crisps is easier than having to peel and cut fruit, but my kids really love it \u2013 and vegetables. It is expensive to buy, rather than the fatty stuff, so I\u2019m careful not to waste it, freezing vegetable portions for dinners.\u201d For parents who are anxious about their children becoming obese, the temptation can be to restrict certain foods and stress the terrible consequences of eating them \u2013 but this approach comes with its own concerns about instilling complexes. \u201cIt is a difficult balance, but I don\u2019t think we should be saying there are taboo foods that we shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d says Adab. \u201cThat extreme has definitely been shown to lead to problems. It\u2019s fine to have sweets on occasion but it should be no more than once a week. Every day we drink water rather than fizzy drinks.\u201d But this isn\u2019t easy, she says, and there needs to be a bigger buy-in from schools and parents. \u201cIf it became the norm it would be different.\u201d Given the temptation-laden world we inhabit, will trying to limit access to unhealthy snacks encourage children to binge on them when they get the opportunity? Adab says there isn\u2019t a scientific consensus as to whether restriction leads to weight gain. \u201cSome studies do find an association, but we recently completed a study and found there isn\u2019t an association when you adjust for children\u2019s weight at the start. It could be that parents are restricting because their child is overweight, rather than the restricting causing the weight.\u201d Zeroing in on weight and size, however, is psychologically unhelpful. Many professionals now emphasise positive, healthy living. \u201cThere is very little evidence that weight management programmes lead to unhealthy behaviours,\u201d says Adab, \u201cbut there is always a concern that children will slip into eating disorders. It is still an area that is underresearched, but on the whole most weight management programmes don\u2019t result in unhealthy behaviour if they are done properly.\u201d The trend now is for weight management programmes to call themselves healthy lifestyle programmes, incorporating increased activity, prioritised sleep and limited time on devices into daily routines. \u201cProviding hands-on activities rather than didactic stuff improves uptake and retention,\u201d says Adab. Donin says that the Child Heart and Health Study in England (Chase) of about 5,000 children aged nine to 10 found lower screen time was linked with a lower fat mass index. Stephanie Byrne, a Henry practitioner who works in Lambeth, south London, says she tends not to mention weight at all: \u201cIt\u2019s more about looking at the whole lifestyle of the family and getting people to identify where they want to make changes.\u201d Rather than going on a diet, families might decide to buy a dining table. \u201cWe talk about eating slowly with other people, regular meals, portion size, not snacking all the time, turning the TV off, talking to children and giving them lots of praise and rewards. The evidence shows that is the best way to tackle childhood obesity and being overweight.\u201d Begum has picked up ideas for how to make being healthy fun, from involving the children in cooking to creating a lucky-dip jar of activity options. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the difference in the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to struggle to get them to bed but now they get tired. Before, I just didn\u2019t think about healthiness.\u201d",

We talked about controlling the defence well and he has a good understanding with Victor [Lindel\u00f6f]. It was a very good match to start with from the whole team.\u201d Of the goal he created for Rashford, Pogba said: \u201cRashy and I understand each other well. We try to do a maximum number of passes like that. I am starting to understand his calls for the ball too and that enables me to find him like I did.\u201d",

Bridging visas and temporary visas have been widely criticised for the damaging effects they have on holders, and the department has previously been accused of \u201cstrategically\u201d using the process to deny protection. Rally attendees held signs that said \u201cI miss my mum\u201d, while others held photos of their children when they last saw them next to photos of them now, much older. Ali Nayyef, an Iraqi refugee and one of the rally organisers, said most of those who attended the protest were temporary or bridging visa holders, and others were wanting to reunite with their family. Nayyef said he had been on a rolling three-year safe haven enterprise visa since 2015. He had seen his children once, in 2017, after obtaining special permission to travel and meet them in Iran. \u201cWhen I was [last in Iraq] my kid was four months, she is now eight years old.

For us, our hearts are broken.\u201d Around 30,000 people are in Australia on temporary protection visas (TPVs) and safe haven enterprise visas (Shevs), which only grant three or five years residency. They have access to limited social security benefits, Medicare, counselling, and work rights \u2013 although Shev holders must study or work in regional Australia. Once it expires they must have their refugee claim reassessed. Since last year the government has been stripping support services from the holders of the six-month bridging visas, prompting warnings it would send some into destitution and homelessness. Temporary visas holders often struggle find to find employment because of the short-term guarantee of their residency. They have no capacity to reunite with their families and must ask permission to travel to other countries, and some people have not seen their children in years. The Australian government maintains that temporary protection visas are one of the \u201cthree pillars\u201d of its border protection policy, along with boat turnbacks and offshore processing. \u201cOne of the most important things to remember with the temporary visas is that these are people who have been recognised as refugees and gone through a difficult process in having the Australian government accept them,\u201d said Dr Anthea Vogl, refugee and migration law academic at the University of Technology, Sydney. \u201cThere are a range of difficulties, but most urgently people have no capacity to establish a life in Australia in they\u2019re only given three to five years of uncertainty to live in the community.\u201d Vogl said people were stopped from establishing a life, and were rendered \u201cpermanently impermanent\u201d. \u201cThere is no pathway to a permanent visa once you have a temporary protection visa,\u201d she said. Nayyef said he fully respected the decisions and rules of the Australian government because he was now \u201ca part of this country and this is our duty\u201d. But he said the rally was a peaceful call for change, for an end to temporary visas and for a process of family reunions and pathways to citizenship. \u201cWe need a permanent visa, we are a part of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia is a small world \u2013 it has many cultures here.

      "body": "<p>Best known for her vagina bodysuits and sexually charged lyrics, Peaches seems an unlikely art-world darling. But in 2007, the French artist Sophie Calle asked the electropunk queen to respond, in the form of a song, to a breakup email Calle had received. The work was one of 100 that appeared in Calle\u2019s show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/16/artnews.art\">Take Care of Yourself</a>, which premiered at the Venice Biennale. Then in 2013, Yoko Ono invited Peaches to re-enact her seminal 1964 performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/02/peaches-cut-piece-yoko-meltdown\">Cut Piece</a>, letting audience members snip away at the singer\u2019s clothes until they had entirely gone. Now, 20 years after unleashing her sex-positive signature song Fuck the Pain Away, Peaches finally has an exhibition of her own.</p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018I want to make new art,\u2019\u201d the Berlin-based, Canadian musician says of the show, which is titled Whose Jizz Is This? A nod to her 2015 track Dick in the Air, it\u2019s a \u201cdeconstructed musical in 14 scenes\u201d, revolving around a series of new works featuring sculpture, prints, video and an eclectic cast of sex toys. This comes to life via a carefully choreographed light show and soundtrack. The exhibition coincides with an over-the-top live show, There\u2019s Only One Peach with the Hole in the Middle, involving 40 performers and musicians. Having just opened at the Hamburg\u2019s Kampnagel theatre, it will play for one night only at the <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/136804-there%E2%80%99s-only-one-peach-hole-middle-2019\">Royal Festival Hall</a> in London later this month.</p> <p>A speculative, post-human tale with an absurdist twist, the exhibition chronicles the emancipation of the \u201cfleshies\u201d \u2013 a community of double-ended silicone masturbators that have broken free from human domination and are now seeking their own sexual liberation. \u201cThey look like disembodied objects where all you\u2019re thinking about is holes,\u201d says Peaches of the male self-pleasuring devices, which she accidentally encountered in a crudely made YouTube review video. This also appears in the show. \u201cI thought, \u2018What if the fleshies decided to rewrite their own narrative and realise they have all the equipment to satisfy themselves in a sexual way?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e611ef3e21a94c4262247679640fdba7a06b8ead\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e611ef3e21a94c4262247679640fdba7a06b8ead/0_373_4250_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I wanted to make new art\u2019 \u2026 Peaches.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wanted to make new art\u2019 \u2026 Peaches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Peaches, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a storyline that touches on a lot of topical issues. \u201cThese objects have been jizzed into, that\u2019s what they\u2019re used for,\u201d says Peaches, linking this to the theme of consent. It\u2019s something she inverts in one of the show\u2019s key pieces: a 7x9m fountain made of four large fleshies squirting liquids into one another. \u201cIt\u2019s consensual,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s between them.\u201d She calls it \u201cquite disturbing, quite deep, if you think of all the elements involved \u2013 but a lot of fun too\u201d.</p> <p>From artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/05/frieze-art-fair-2016-review-everyones-a-performer-in-the-boozy-fruity-house-of-fun\">Portia Munson\u2019s child</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/05/frieze-art-fair-2016-review-everyones-a-performer-in-the-boozy-fruity-house-of-fun\">like pink dildo</a> installations to Laurie Simmons\u2019 introspective photographs of life-size love dolls, the sex toy (formerly known as \u201ca marital aid\u201d) isn\u2019t new to galleries. But Peaches\u2019 references are far more crass than that, as evidenced by her raunchy stage aesthetic and often grotesque props. However, her multi-boob neck pieces aren\u2019t too dissimilar from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/06/sarah-lucas-venice-biennale-interview\">Sarah Lucas</a>\u2019s sculptures with tights, and her crowd-surfing inflatable condom is worthy of the filthiest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/11/paul-mccarthy-artist\">Paul McCarthy</a> installation. These are two contemporary artists she admits to having conversations with \u201cin my mind\u201d.</p> <p>Art wasn\u2019t always present in the singer\u2019s life. \u201cI grew up in a Jewish community where you listened to Fiddler on the Roof and West Side Story,\u201d says the woman born Merrill Beth Nisker. These musicals could explain her early penchant for the theatrical, not to mention her one-woman remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/peaches-jesus-christ-superstar\">Jesus Christ Superstar</a> and body-positive opera rock film <a href=\"https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/peaches-does-herself-review-1200713627/\">Peaches Does Herself</a>. Peaches, now 52, was a late bloomer as a musician. After teaching drama to young children at a YMCA and private schools for nearly a decade, she came of age among Toronto\u2019s fine indie scene, performing with Jason Beck (aka Chilly Gonzales) and Leslie Feist, with whom she shared an apartment above a co-operative sex store in the late 1990s.</p> <p>Does she think the mainstreaming of queer culture has revived interest in her work? \u201cMaybe I\u2019m naive,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I feel like the interest never went away.\u201d Instead, the feminist icon \u2013 who counts Iggy Pop, Christina Aguilera and Pink as collaborators \u2013 prefers to think about how the changing landscape has made her reconsider her oeuvre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65ece5ff91a1ae9fd23ec24d79128d0ec92eaef2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65ece5ff91a1ae9fd23ec24d79128d0ec92eaef2/0_0_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 performing Peaches Christ Superstar in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Complex messiah \u2026 performing Peaches Christ Superstar in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On stage, she has been experimenting with new lyrics, introducing more inclusive terminology to previously gendered songs. \u201cI don\u2019t have to make the choice, I like girls and I like boys\u201d has become \u201cGender fluid make some noise\u201d.

Now, 20 years after unleashing her sex-positive signature song Fuck the Pain Away, Peaches finally has an exhibition of her own. \u201cI was like, \u2018I want to make new art,\u2019\u201d the Berlin-based, Canadian musician says of the show, which is titled Whose Jizz Is This? A nod to her 2015 track Dick in the Air, it\u2019s a \u201cdeconstructed musical in 14 scenes\u201d, revolving around a series of new works featuring sculpture, prints, video and an eclectic cast of sex toys. This comes to life via a carefully choreographed light show and soundtrack. The exhibition coincides with an over-the-top live show, There\u2019s Only One Peach with the Hole in the Middle, involving 40 performers and musicians. Having just opened at the Hamburg\u2019s Kampnagel theatre, it will play for one night only at the Royal Festival Hall in London later this month. A speculative, post-human tale with an absurdist twist, the exhibition chronicles the emancipation of the \u201cfleshies\u201d \u2013 a community of double-ended silicone masturbators that have broken free from human domination and are now seeking their own sexual liberation. \u201cThey look like disembodied objects where all you\u2019re thinking about is holes,\u201d says Peaches of the male self-pleasuring devices, which she accidentally encountered in a crudely made YouTube review video. This also appears in the show. \u201cI thought, \u2018What if the fleshies decided to rewrite their own narrative and realise they have all the equipment to satisfy themselves in a sexual way?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a storyline that touches on a lot of topical issues. \u201cThese objects have been jizzed into, that\u2019s what they\u2019re used for,\u201d says Peaches, linking this to the theme of consent. It\u2019s something she inverts in one of the show\u2019s key pieces: a 7x9m fountain made of four large fleshies squirting liquids into one another. \u201cIt\u2019s consensual,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s between them.\u201d She calls it \u201cquite disturbing, quite deep, if you think of all the elements involved \u2013 but a lot of fun too\u201d. From artist Portia Munson\u2019s childlike pink dildo installations to Laurie Simmons\u2019 introspective photographs of life-size love dolls, the sex toy (formerly known as \u201ca marital aid\u201d) isn\u2019t new to galleries. But Peaches\u2019 references are far more crass than that, as evidenced by her raunchy stage aesthetic and often grotesque props. However, her multi-boob neck pieces aren\u2019t too dissimilar from Sarah Lucas\u2019s sculptures with tights, and her crowd-surfing inflatable condom is worthy of the filthiest Paul McCarthy installation. These are two contemporary artists she admits to having conversations with \u201cin my mind\u201d. Art wasn\u2019t always present in the singer\u2019s life. \u201cI grew up in a Jewish community where you listened to Fiddler on the Roof and West Side Story,\u201d says the woman born Merrill Beth Nisker. These musicals could explain her early penchant for the theatrical, not to mention her one-woman remake of Jesus Christ Superstar and body-positive opera rock film Peaches Does Herself. Peaches, now 52, was a late bloomer as a musician. After teaching drama to young children at a YMCA and private schools for nearly a decade, she came of age among Toronto\u2019s fine indie scene, performing with Jason Beck (aka Chilly Gonzales) and Leslie Feist, with whom she shared an apartment above a co-operative sex store in the late 1990s. Does she think the mainstreaming of queer culture has revived interest in her work? \u201cMaybe I\u2019m naive,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I feel like the interest never went away.\u201d Instead, the feminist icon \u2013 who counts Iggy Pop, Christina Aguilera and Pink as collaborators \u2013 prefers to think about how the changing landscape has made her reconsider her oeuvre. On stage, she has been experimenting with new lyrics, introducing more inclusive terminology to previously gendered songs. \u201cI don\u2019t have to make the choice, I like girls and I like boys\u201d has become \u201cGender fluid make some noise\u201d. And she has recently been collaborating with such younger performers as the New York \u201cdrag terrorist\u201d Christeene and the Australian aerial burlesque artist Empress Stah. \u201cIn a way, I learn,\u201d she says. \u201cThings move, things grow, things change.\u201d These\u2019s nothing new about a musician trying to cross over into the gallery. Godmother of punk Patti Smith has wandered in and out of art circles throughout her career, showing her quiet black-and-white photographs everywhere from Paris to San Francisco. Meanwhile, Bj\u00f6rk may still be recovering from her badly received retrospective at MoMA PS1 in New York four years ago. While it is too early to assess the impact of Peaches\u2019 flamboyant fleshies, they certainly reflect a key aspect of their creator: radical queer joy. Whose Jizz Is This? is at Kunstverein, Hamburg, until 20 October. There\u2019s Only One Peach with the Hole in the Middle is at Kampnagel, Hamburg, until 17 August and Royal Festival Hall, London, on 28 August.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cJamia Masjid old town Baramulla witnessed approx 10,000 people offering prayers,\u201d the spokesperson said on Twitter. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the claim.</p> \n<p>India\u2019s foreign ministry shared photos of people visiting mosques, but a spokesman was not able to specify where the photos were taken within Jammu and Kashmir, which New Delhi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\">downgraded from a state to two federal territories</a> a week ago.</p> \n<p>The Kashmir police chief, Dilbagh Singh, said people \u201chave been asked to offer prayers locally\u201d.

This is the festival of joy and happiness.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is very little independent information about what is happening in Kashmir because of the communication blackout.

An Indian home affairs ministry official denied there were protests of any more than 20 people. The BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/49306816/article-370-tear-gas-at-kashmir-rally-india-denies-happened\">later released a video</a> showing huge crowds marching through the streets of Srinagar, as well as police opening fire and using teargas.</p> \n<p>Curfew rules were introduced in Kashmir on Monday last week, just hours before the government announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\">revoke the territory\u2019s autonomy</a> and rules that prevent outsiders from buying land.

Typically, residents visit hundreds of neighbours, relatives and friends door-to-door to offer the meat of a sacrificed sheep or goat.</p> \n<p>The security lockdown appears to be aimed at avoiding a backlash in Kashmir, where most people oppose Indian rule, and is expected to last until Thursday, India\u2019s independence day.</p> \n<p>Restrictions on movement were briefly lifted again over the weekend, allowing people to visit shops, but reimposed on Sunday afternoon. On TV news, jeeps were shown driving around the region, telling people to return to their homes and shopkeepers to shut markets.</p> \n<p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Large congregations have been banned for the major Islamic festival of Eid in Indian-administered Kashmir, where an unprecedented communications block on landlines, mobile and the internet remained in place for an eighth day. Residents have been allowed to visit their local mosque, according to Indian officials, but the communications block means they have been unable to call relatives. Large congregations were banned in an apparent attempt to avoid anti-India protests. A spokesperson for the Indian home affairs ministry said prayers had gone ahead peacefully in all local mosques in Anantnag, Baramulla, Budgam and Bandipore \u201cwithout any untoward incident\u201d. \u201cJamia Masjid old town Baramulla witnessed approx 10,000 people offering prayers,\u201d the spokesperson said on Twitter. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the claim. India\u2019s foreign ministry shared photos of people visiting mosques, but a spokesman was not able to specify where the photos were taken within Jammu and Kashmir, which New Delhi downgraded from a state to two federal territories a week ago. The Kashmir police chief, Dilbagh Singh, said people \u201chave been asked to offer prayers locally\u201d. Shanawaz Shah, a local resident, told AFP: \u201cI can\u2019t believe we are forced to be in our homes on this festival. This is the festival of joy and happiness.\u201d There is very little independent information about what is happening in Kashmir because of the communication blackout. Tens of thousands of troop reinforcements have flooded the main city of Srinagar and other Kashmir towns and villages. Last week police reportedly opened fire and used teargas to break up 10,000 protestors in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, which took place after curfew rules were temporarily eased to allow people to attend Friday prayers. An Indian home affairs ministry official denied there were protests of any more than 20 people. The BBC later released a video showing huge crowds marching through the streets of Srinagar, as well as police opening fire and using teargas. Curfew rules were introduced in Kashmir on Monday last week, just hours before the government announced it would revoke the territory\u2019s autonomy and rules that prevent outsiders from buying land. Many Kashmiris fear the move would alter the demography of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state and its traditions. It is unlikely people will be able to carry out many of the usual celebrations for Eid-al-Adha, one of the biggest events of the year in Kashmir. Typically, residents visit hundreds of neighbours, relatives and friends door-to-door to offer the meat of a sacrificed sheep or goat. The security lockdown appears to be aimed at avoiding a backlash in Kashmir, where most people oppose Indian rule, and is expected to last until Thursday, India\u2019s independence day. Restrictions on movement were briefly lifted again over the weekend, allowing people to visit shops, but reimposed on Sunday afternoon. On TV news, jeeps were shown driving around the region, telling people to return to their homes and shopkeepers to shut markets. Associated Press contributed to this report",

Or, to quote the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/madeline-miller\" title=\"\">Madeline Miller</a>, a woman with \u201cmore power than men have felt comfortable with\u201d. History teaches us that witches are dangerous and must be brought down, punished and silenced. Their wisdom and their force must be neutralised through interrogation, torture and execution. Yet these attitudes aren\u2019t merely historical; women continue to be persecuted for witchcraft in the world today. There has been a perennial literary fascination with witches; they are, as Marion Gibson, professor of Renaissance and magical literatures at Exeter University says, \u201ca shorthand symbol for persecution and resistance \u2013 misogyny and feminism in particular\u201d. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> world, where Donald Trump \u2013 a fan of the term \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d \u2013 is US president, it is really no surprise that female writers are examining the role of the witch in new ways.</p> <p>Since Trump\u2019s election, which inspired mass spell-casting by thousands of \u201cresistance witches\u201d (the selection of judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh\" title=\"\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> for the supreme court also led to a mass \u201chex-in\u201d), there has been a slew of novels, poetry collections and anthologies with witchcraft as their theme. Things haven\u2019t felt so witchy since the 1990s, when there was a glut of TV programmes such as <em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</em> and<em> Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, and<em> </em>books and films on the subject.

Shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize and soon to become an HBO series, the novel sees Circe, a victim of rape, turn men into pigs in a spell that Miller reframed as self-defence.</p> <p>In the opening of the fearless, transgressive poetry collection <em>WITCH</em>, readers are greeted with a \u201cpenis hex\u201d. Later there are \u201cspells\u201d for exile, for online porn, for UN resolutions, all written in a voice that is radical in its freedom, evoking sensual imagery of earth, blood, sex and body as a way of unravelling femininity and its history. Tam\u00e1s explores how an affinity with nature and a talent for herbal remedies were cast as something dark and evil, and how women resisted. In the poem \u201cWITCH TRIALS\u201d, we catch a glimpse of what underpins the desire, or need, for magic: \u201cthe witch tries to think about how it started /maybe it was when a girl came home late at / night with half her clothes missing / maybe it was when the witch made beds in the cellar / for everyone coming to abort their unwanted babies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At\u00a0their best, witches are symbols of resistance against patriarchy and the harnessing of feminine power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI wanted to write a book of a poetry that would somehow interrogate or sound out silenced and repressed female history \u2013 the thousands of years of lived experience that we have almost no record of,\u201d says Tam\u00e1s. \u201cFor me, the witch represents all of that repressed agency \u2026 which constantly bubbles up to the surface [in] an unsettling vision of female power, female sexuality, female independence.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the literary witch is nothing new. She has existed since storytelling began, from Circe, the first witch in western literature, to Hecate, Morgan le Fay, Baba Yaga, the Weird Sisters, the Wicked Witch of the West and Hermione Granger. At their worst, literary witches are stereotypical and derivative; at their best they are symbols of resistance against patriarchy and the harnessing of feminine power.</p> <p>Rereading <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/09/100-best-novels-jane-eyre\" title=\"\">Jane Eyre</a></em> recently, I was struck by how witchy it is. Not only is Jane referred to as such by Rochester (\u201cHow well you read me, you witch!\u201d he says to her, also calling her an \u201cimp\u201d, a \u201csorceress\u201d, a \u201csprite\u201d and someone who \u201chas the look of another world\u201d), but she also has visions and premonitory dreams, consults what she thinks is a fortune teller, and paints strange symbolic paintings. These are fitting allusions when considering Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s depiction of the subtle power dynamics between Jane and Rochester. Jane is defiant and resisting of male control even in childhood, and as the novel develops, the balance of power shifts in her favour.</p> <p>Another famous literary portrayal of witchcraft, this time by a male novelist, is John Updike\u2019s 1984 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/14/witches-of-eastwick-digested-watch\" title=\"\">The Witches of Eastwick</a></em>, written in part as a response to accusations regarding Updike\u2019s male chauvinist depiction of women. Readers still don\u2019t seem to agree as to whether it is feminist or, as it has been called, a \u201cgreat misogynist novel\u201d. Rather satirically, Updike\u2019s witches, who can fly through the air and perform hexes, only gain their power when they get divorced, though that doesn\u2019t mean that they have lost interest in men: they are witches as seductresses, their power is carnal. They are also dangerous. \u201cIf you\u2019re wired heterosexually,\u201d the author once told Margaret Atwood, \u201cwomen can be strange, elusive, and frightening to a degree.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview not long before his death, Updike reflected on his inspiration for writing the novel: \u201cThe era in which I wrote it was full of feminism and talk about how women should be in charge of the world. There would be no war. There would be nothing unpleasant, in fact, if women were in charge of the world. So I tried to write this book about women who, in achieving freedom of a sort, acquired power, the power that witches would have if there were witches. And they use it to kill another witch. So they behave no better with their power than men do. That was my chauvinistic thought.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76a9097fb0f7152957480cf36ffbbdb6cacf2390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76a9097fb0f7152957480cf36ffbbdb6cacf2390/0_74_2735_1641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feminist or misogynist? \u2026 the 1987 film adaptation of John Updike\u2019s The Witches of Eastwick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feminist or misogynist? \u2026 the 1987 film adaptation of John Updike\u2019s The Witches of Eastwick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/WARNER BROS/Allstar/Cinetext/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems rather feminist to me, at least more so than the witches I grew up with on television. \u201cUpdike wrote his witches as quite ambiguous figures, partly inspiring and partly villainous,\u201d says professor Gibson. \u201cBut the 1987 film of the book presented them as much more glamorous, empowering women, part of a trend of young, sexy witches which continued throughout the 90s.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, portrayals of witches are now nuanced again.

      "bodyText": "A witch is a woman who has too much power. Or, to quote the novelist Madeline Miller, a woman with \u201cmore power than men have felt comfortable with\u201d. History teaches us that witches are dangerous and must be brought down, punished and silenced. Their wisdom and their force must be neutralised through interrogation, torture and execution. Yet these attitudes aren\u2019t merely historical; women continue to be persecuted for witchcraft in the world today. There has been a perennial literary fascination with witches; they are, as Marion Gibson, professor of Renaissance and magical literatures at Exeter University says, \u201ca shorthand symbol for persecution and resistance \u2013 misogyny and feminism in particular\u201d. In a #MeToo world, where Donald Trump \u2013 a fan of the term \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d \u2013 is US president, it is really no surprise that female writers are examining the role of the witch in new ways. Since Trump\u2019s election, which inspired mass spell-casting by thousands of \u201cresistance witches\u201d (the selection of judge Brett Kavanaugh for the supreme court also led to a mass \u201chex-in\u201d), there has been a slew of novels, poetry collections and anthologies with witchcraft as their theme. Things haven\u2019t felt so witchy since the 1990s, when there was a glut of TV programmes such as Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and books and films on the subject. It makes sense: the women of my generation were girls then, and now we have come of age, and are shaping our own narratives, joining other female writers in grappling with perennial questions of power and agency. This year alone we have seen Lucie McKnight Hardy\u2019s Shirley Jackson-esque novel Water Shall Refuse Them; Elle Nash\u2019s Animals Eat Each Other, a dark, obsessive coming-of\u2011age novella; WITCH by Rebecca Tam\u00e1s; The Glass Woman by Caroline Lea (a rare look at male witch trials, set in Iceland). Then last year there was Circe, Miller\u2019s reimagining of the story of the witch from the Odyssey. Shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize and soon to become an HBO series, the novel sees Circe, a victim of rape, turn men into pigs in a spell that Miller reframed as self-defence. In the opening of the fearless, transgressive poetry collection WITCH, readers are greeted with a \u201cpenis hex\u201d. Later there are \u201cspells\u201d for exile, for online porn, for UN resolutions, all written in a voice that is radical in its freedom, evoking sensual imagery of earth, blood, sex and body as a way of unravelling femininity and its history. Tam\u00e1s explores how an affinity with nature and a talent for herbal remedies were cast as something dark and evil, and how women resisted. In the poem \u201cWITCH TRIALS\u201d, we catch a glimpse of what underpins the desire, or need, for magic: \u201cthe witch tries to think about how it started /maybe it was when a girl came home late at / night with half her clothes missing / maybe it was when the witch made beds in the cellar / for everyone coming to abort their unwanted babies.\u201d \u201cI wanted to write a book of a poetry that would somehow interrogate or sound out silenced and repressed female history \u2013 the thousands of years of lived experience that we have almost no record of,\u201d says Tam\u00e1s. \u201cFor me, the witch represents all of that repressed agency \u2026 which constantly bubbles up to the surface [in] an unsettling vision of female power, female sexuality, female independence.\u201d Of course, the literary witch is nothing new.

The freezing breaths of a dormant leviathan \u2013 slumbering somewhere out in the depths. </p> \n<p>It\u2019s 1am and judging by the flickering glow of televisions in the windows of the bleak two-storey rows facing us, it\u2019s clear that few of the local residents are asleep. Shielded only by flimsy blinds it\u2019s impossible to escape the midnight sun in the northern Greenlandic town of Ilulissat. The light here, some 180 miles north of the Arctic Circle, seeks out every man-made chink and weakness; the cracks and folds of window frames, even the keyholes of doors. </p> \n<p>Only an hour ago a gang of local children, called in by impatient mothers, finally stopped bouncing on a communal trampoline. At each jump, in the heart of the world\u2019s most remarkably situated public housing complex, they would have glimpsed one of the most incredible views imaginable. Only a large industrial chimney distorts an otherwise unhindered view of Greenland\u2019s Ilulissat ice fjord, the frozen womb that calves 35bn tonnes of icebergs every year and sends them floating silently past, the size of city blocks, towards the northern Atlantic and a meltwater demise. </p> \n<p>Constructed for coal miners in the late 1970s, the social housing units known locally as \u201cthe white blocks\u201d are, in fact, a broad pallette of colours from blue to green and red. Seal blood and outboard engine oil stains the concrete stairwells. Graffiti \u2013 some of it scrawled in anger \u2013 is political: protesting against Greenland\u2019sstatus as both an autonomous country and a part of the Kingdom of Denmark.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e83fa4d5cff17d4d14c14093225303291cdf0e36\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e83fa4d5cff17d4d14c14093225303291cdf0e36/1_0_1918_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social housing blocks in Ilulissat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Despite the international attention on Greenland, voices from islanders are rarely heard.</strong></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dewald Brand</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Away from global headlines about ice cap melt 80km inland from here, this is the frontline of climate change. In Greenland\u2019s working-class housing blocks single mums, fishermen, hotel cleaners, pensioners and hunters have their own fears for the future. Changing climate and the encroachment of the modern age has dramatically impacted the Inuit who live here in Ilulissat, and in other towns across the Arctic. </p> \n<p>The next generation of Greenlanders face the biggest challenge in the island\u2019s arduous history. Released on Monday, a survey by the University of Copenhagen, the Kraks Fond Institute for Urban Economic Research and the University of Greenland reveals that climate crisis is having an untold psychological effect. </p> \n<p>In what is broadly accepted as the first nationwide study on local reaction, <a href=\"https://kraksfondbyforskning.dk/en/blog/gp-climatechange/\">the Greenlandic Perspectives Survey (GPS)</a> reveals that 92% of residents think that climate change is happening, just 1% of residents do not. A further 76% of local people also claim to have personally experienced the effects \u2013 a damning figure. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:15:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic: The vast majority of Greenlanders think climate change is happening\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:15:25/embed.html\">Graphic: The vast majority of Greenlanders think climate change is happening</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The survey, covering an area almost three times the size of France and carried out by researchers from the universities of Greenland and Copenhagen, also destroyed a popular myth: that Greenlanders overwhelmingly believe they will benefit from a thaw. Instead, the majority believe it will harm its people, plants and animals. The survey teams travelled by plane, boat and helicopter to reach some of the most hostile and remote locations in the Arctic over the past few months, to map the increasing social anxiety and trauma in Greenland connected to the climate crisis.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><strong>We understand the ice</strong> more than we understand the people</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Understanding Greenland is impossible unless you look closely at a map. Perched beneath the world\u2019s second-largest ice cap after Antarctica, slivers of land cling to jagged outcrops and natural harbours. Greenland has a compressed and angular coastline, designed to break the ankles and the resolve of potential settlers. Other than black moss and lichen, nothing much grows.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/greenland-zip/giv-3902iasVAzLfIG1B/\" data-alt=\"map of Greenland\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/greenland-zip/giv-3902iasVAzLfIG1B/\">map of Greenland</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Even the delicate summer flowers barely colour the terrain. There is no question, as you travel across it, that this feels like a poor country. </p> \n<p> The island\u2019s well-documented high rates of unemployment and alcoholism, depression and suicide, remain a huge challenge. Schoolchildren rank abysmally on tests relative to their contemporaries in Denmark.</p> \n<p>The island\u2019s ice sheet covers 80% of the land. Its centre, which is almost 2 miles thick, generates its own weather system. It is a mass so great that it affects the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/avoid-at-all-costs-gulf-streams-record-weakening-prompts-warnings-global-warming\">distribution of the gulf stream</a> in the Atlantic Ocean. </p> \n<p>The world\u2019s largest island is currently the most topical place on earth. In July temperatures at the highest reaches of the normally frigid interior rose above freezing, <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/greenland-ice-sheet-just-poured-197-billion-tons-of-water-to-the-ocean-in-july\">melting snow at the Summit Station</a>, 3,200 metres above sea level. </p> \n<p>Nasa has a semi-permanent presence here and satellites capture the ice melt in real-time and in high resolution. Ice stations across the interior boast scientists from every G20 nation. Greenland\u2019s melting has been adopted as the world\u2019s problem \u2013 not that of the local population of 57,000 people.</p> \n<p>Voices from the <a href=\"https://www.iwgia.org/en/greenland\">90% Inuit population</a> have been rarely heard. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt feels strange to be saying this but when it comes to Greenland we actually understand the ice more than we understand the people,\u201d says Kelton Minor, lead author of the survey. \u201cHistorically, many survey samples of the Greenlandic population were taken from the radius of local airports, which doesn\u2019t give us a picture of a vast and complex country. This is perhaps understandable given the logistical challenges the country presents, but we felt it was both an oversight and an opportunity. There has never been a nationwide survey on climate change perceptions in Greenland\u2019s history. For a nation in the grip of record ice melt, this felt like something that needed to be done.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b72f3d5f8367bba639ff6022c50bbc13d829b4a4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72f3d5f8367bba639ff6022c50bbc13d829b4a4/1_0_1918_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A housing block in Ilulissat, Greenland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Social housing blocks in Ilulissat are the hidden frontline of the climate crisis.</strong></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dewald Brand</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Minor believes this randomised sample of 2% of the adult population provides indisputable data. \u201cFor the first time, we can begin to understand how the inhabitants of the island most people feel is at the heart of the climate crisis, actually feel about the changing world around them and how it impacts their own culture, food security and state of mind.\u201d </p> \n<p>More than half of all Greenland residents interviewed report dramatic glacier retreat near their settlements. Perhaps one of the most tragic aspects of the study is the anxiety over the future of a way of life that has endured for a millennium; 67% of residents think that the crisis will harm sled dogs. Despite the advent of supermarkets in larger towns, most Greenlanders still eat wild foods they hunt, fish or gather, and 57% think hunting practices will be harmed. About half, 49%, think fishing will be negatively affected. Eight in 10 Greenland residents believe that in recent years the local sea ice, a key economic and social lifeline in winter, has become too dangerous to travel on.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><strong>First we teach the children to float.</strong> Their limbs jutting out in a star shape</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For Greenland\u2019s people, the sea ice is everything. When the sea freezes, the polar north expands, offering opportunity as daylight disappears. Greenlanders live their lives stuck between the Arctic Sea and an unforgiving icy interior. With no roads across the glaciers and fjords that separate scattered coastal towns, the freeze offers escape. For as long as the Inuit have been in Greenland, winter has been the time for visits, journeys, and hunts. Dogsleds, snowmobiles, even Japanese-built taxis with snow chains and fuel trucks can skid across frozen water. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe impact of melting sea ice on the Greenlandic way of life cannot be underestimated,\u201d says Minor. \u201cSea ice is an open highway, traversed by dog sled and snowmobile, connecting citizens to neighbouring communities. An umbilical cord to friends and family in remote rural settlements. When it fails to freeze in winter it\u2019s an obstacle to the community, to society in many ways. The local population goes from being connected to others around them to living on islands, effectively an archipelago given the lack of roads in Greenland. This, in the long term, could bring an enormous challenge to the quality of life. Many of the ice fishermen we met were teaching their children to float if they fall through the water, their limbs jutting out in a star shape. The frozen sea is now a threat.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:16:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic: 79% of residents think sea ice has become more dangerous to travel on\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:16:16/embed.html\">Graphic: 79% of residents think sea ice has become more dangerous to travel on</a> \n</figure> \n<p> </p> \n<p>We are tragically familiar with lean polar bears, unable to stalk seals on flimsy sea ice, <a href=\"https://www.arctictoday.com/greenland-polar-bear-management-plan-seeks-balance-conservation-exploitation/\">invading Arctic settlements for food</a>. </p> \n<p>Greenland\u2019s people face similar challenges. For a village society whose hunters have long supplied seal meat and halibut in winter, the cold season is becoming a time of fear to step on to the ice. Even the sound of Greenland is changing. Villages once echoed to the howl of sled dogs, but hunters are now turning to desperate measures to keep their family\u2019s heads above water.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><strong>Shooting your dogs</strong> is like killing your own child</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In Ilulissat, Claus Rassmussen is stirring a foul brew of oily blood and fish. \u201cSeal stew,\u201d the sled-dog hunter says. Strung out in a row, his family carry buckets of the murky soup to feed to the dogs \u2013 a nightly ritual for Rassmussen and his five daughters. </p> \n<p>Over the past two decades, Greenland\u2019s sled dog population <a href=\"http://sciencenordic.com/greenlands-sled-dog-population-decreasing-rapidly\">has halved</a> to around 15,000 with the numbers still falling. Greenland\u2019s unique sled dog culture and the specialised training technology and knowledge is in danger of disappearing. </p> \n<p>An interview with Rassmussen proves more emotional than anticipated. In his modest home, an old wooden cottage among social housing blocks, his face is contorted. Instead of the Greenlandic way \u2013 long silences and monosyllabic answers \u2013 there comes an outpouring. </p> \n<p>There are six of us crouched in the room, including three of his daughters, as he talks about the decision to kill his beloved dogs because he could no longer afford to feed them. As he talks about shooting one, a dog given the name \u201cmy son\u201d in the local language, the teenagers burst into tears \u2013 a shocking explosion of grief in a culture where emotion is rarely shown. In Inuit culture, strength, silence, and self-sufficiency are admired traits. </p> \n<p>\u201cI had a blood clot last year and couldn\u2019t hunt,\u201d says Rassmussen. \u201cHere in Ilulissat we have the ice fjord and, for now, it\u2019s strong enough to hold us, but I was unable to walk for nine months. The trouble was nobody wanted my dogs so I had to kill eight of 13.</p> \n<p>\u201cI killed my favourites. To spare them possible cruelty. That was my decision. The others were given away to people I knew. They weren\u2019t dog people, but were interested in having animals \u2013 but perhaps they weren\u2019t looked after in the way they should\u2019ve been. I managed to take some back and since then I have been building up a new dog team.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93d55fc64a9c74fdbe9195b49a15dfef87bf38d5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93d55fc64a9c74fdbe9195b49a15dfef87bf38d5/1_0_1918_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claus Rassmussen with his family in Ilulissat, Greenland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Claus Rassmussen is a dog-sled hunter who lives in Ilulissat with his family.</strong></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dewald Brand</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For his family, the sea ice is the only lifeline that can get them through the most financially challenging months. Since the age of 12, he has been pulling halibut from the fjord, selling his catch to the town\u2019s fishing factory where it is filleted within two hours and flown to London. </p> \n<p>With thick fur and strong shoulders, Rassmussen\u2019s dogs are a cold-hardy breed of husky, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/24/greenland-is-melting\">which the Inuit brought with them when they migrated to Greenland</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s all about money. Unlike dogs, snowmobiles do not need to be raised or fed. We have vet bills. Our dogs are exposed to infectious diseases. The industrial fish waste we once used as dog food is now exported for human consumption. We can\u2019t afford to go on and I worry that I am raising these new dogs only to have them shot again.\u201d </p> \n<p>The relationship between Rassmussen and his dogs is best revealed in an anecdote from his youth. \u201cI was 12 and out fishing with my stepfather. A storm came in over the ice fjord and the iceberg calved and the sheet began to give way. We knew because the dogs spread themselves wide when the ice starts to go \u2013 to improve the odds of not going under. We could see the animals were worried we were going down into the sea \u2013 they were quiet and they looked to us to save them. There were others stranded out there that night and the helicopter came out from the town to airlift the sled teams. But they told us we couldn\u2019t take the dogs on the winches. I said no to my stepfather. We can\u2019t leave them behind to drown. At 12 I would rather have died than leave them. He agreed with me, but we were sinking. So we fought our way back \u2013 the helicopter above us streaming a path with its lights. We became heroes that night. Putting our dogs first. The Greenlandic way.\u201d</p> \n<p>As we walk to feed his new crop of huskies, a neighbour runs up to Rassmussen and hands over a bloodied plastic bag of discarded halibut. It is accepted not with thanks, but an understanding that everyone in the community must play a part in the preservation of a way of life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fde68967d247f943da1fa0c915fb31929343047\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fde68967d247f943da1fa0c915fb31929343047/1_0_1918_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A aerial view of sea ice in Greenland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Previously navigable routes across ice in Greenland are falling victim to global heating.</strong></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dewald Brand</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sled dogs are as much a part of the landscape as the lichen and the sea. Their howls comfort people as the fog rolls in. Anna Martha Larsen, a former social worker, who has lived in the same housing block since it was built, recalls her late husband, a sled-dog fisherman, plying a thriving trade route between Disko Island and Ilulissat, a journey of 50 miles on 2-metre-thick ice. </p> \n<p>\u201cDespite long summer seasons, fish is getting harder to come by here. It\u2019s abundant, but exported. It\u2019s too expensive. I even see fishermen and their families having poverty problems and nutrition problems. They\u2019re eating more pork and fast food, and there are more and more people with diabetes. We are surrounded by a rich source of protein, yet we can\u2019t afford to eat it fresh. My husband wouldn\u2019t recognise the world we live in here.\u201d </p> \n<p>Each winter more and more ice journeys fall victim to warming oceans. Disko Bay hunters can no longer lay seal nets under the ice in the 24-hour winter darkness. The Fram Strait, located between Greenland and Svalbard, a crossing for polar bears, has become increasingly treacherous. From Uummannaq ice fjord, transportation to seven local settlements is also no longer possible in winter, neither are crossings of the Inglefield Gulf in the north-west of the island. </p> \n<p>Greenland\u2019s world is shrinking. </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><strong>Don\u2019t be alone</strong> with your dark thoughts</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For mental health professionals, the survey findings present another red flag for the Arctic\u2019s Inuit communities, already known for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/inuit-inughuit-eskimo-polar-arctic\">high suicide rate</a>, and historical struggle with depression that is echoed across the region, from Greenland to the S\u00e1mi of northern Finland and Sweden.</p> \n<p>The main concern in Greenland is the consensus that people who already have mental health problems are more likely to become anxious or depressed, or even traumatised, by events out of their control, like the climate crisis. Dr Courtney Howard, the board president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, works at the intersection between the climate emergency and health in the Arctic. </p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no question Arctic people are now showing symptoms of anxiety, \u2018ecological grief\u2019 and even post-traumatic stress related to the effects of climate change. The impact of climate change on mental health is a looming public health crisis. So if a Greenland-wide survey points to anxieties around food security and way of life it\u2019s another red line between climate change and mental health,\u201d says Howard. \u201cWe are searching for terms to capture this deep feeling of pain in Arctic nations \u2013 words like eco-anxiety or ecological grief \u2013 but for me, something called \u2018solastalgia\u2019 perfectly sums up how people living on the frontline of climate change feel. It was <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5820433_Solastalgia_The_Distress_Caused_by_Environmental_Change\">coined</a> by the Australian environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht. It is also related to an Inuit word that refers to a friend behaving in an unfamiliar way. It means feeling homesick when you are home. Many of these islanders are in mourning for a disappearing way of life.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:14:20/embed.html\" data-alt=\"75% have personally experienced climate change\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:14:20/embed.html\">75% have personally experienced climate change</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Howard\u2019s biggest concern is the lack of acknowledgement. \u201cWe are challenging the medical profession to acknowledge the world we are inheriting. Schools and universities aren\u2019t considering how climate change will affect people from a medical or a psychological perspective, so we are not training a new generation of medical professionals to help people in a fast-changing planet, and this is intolerable. We are moving too slowly on this.\u201d </p> \n<p>In Greenland, health workers believe in a need to work together. In her neat wooden chalet-turned-clinic in Ilulissat, a crayon-etched poster on Astrid Olsen\u2019s wall reads: \u201cNo one is alone. Don\u2019t be alone with your dark thoughts.\u201d Working in mental health among the region\u2019s teenagers for the past three decades, Olsen is part of an emergency response team that helicopters into Greenland\u2019s settlements after suicides to prevent a domino effect of self-harm. She was here in Ilulissat a decade ago when, in relatively short order, eight adolescents in a community of 4,000 people killed themselves. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57f2add5ac298e93d90005bfef89047431792009\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f2add5ac298e93d90005bfef89047431792009/1_0_1918_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Astrid Olson, a health worker in Ilulissat, Greenland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Astrid Olson, a health worker, encourages the community to talk about mental health issues.</strong></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dewald Brand</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPeople who are socio-economically disadvantaged, like many people here in Greenland, are also more likely to endure mental health challenges. It\u2019s fair to say many people know a relative or friend who has taken their own life,\u201d says Polsen. \u201cThings have improved in Ilulissat because we have learned from our mistakes but this isn\u2019t the case in rural parts of the country. Many of my colleagues feel climate change is another issue we don\u2019t need here in Greenland. My answer to them is not to be defeated, but to reach out to Canada, Norway and Iceland and find answers together. We are all on this ship.\u201d </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><strong>We call it the flip.</strong> This is what we do in summer</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In the south-east of Greenland the rural population has been shrinking for decades. Young Greenlanders leave small villages for urban centres, in search of educational and occupational opportunities. Far more women leave than men. In Denmark, many Inuit, having left small-town life in Greenland, struggle with prejudice and unemployment.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Our local translator describes life in the midnight sun as \u201cthe flip\u201d. \u201cWe live life in reverse,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe play video games and watch Netflix and smoke into the night. Then we sleep all day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tasiilaq feels a world away from even Ilulissat. In the coastal town of 1,500 people a minke whale, caught the night before, was sprawled out in the harbour, its blood and guts spilling back into the sea. Here, teenage pregnancy rates are abnormally high and, considering the location, so is drug abuse, particularly growing dependence on cannabis among teenagers. <br></p> \n<p>The weekend before our arrival two residents took their own lives. One was Ingrid Korneliussen, 24, who was unemployed and had three children. In recent months the children had been taken from her by the local authorities and placed into foster care. Not entirely unusual. In late July she had visited her brother, Age Korneliussen, at their mother\u2019s home, but he had gone fishing. She killed herself shortly after.. Her other brother, Lars, struggles to articulate his loss. He laughs nervously as he recalls his sister\u2019s love for his nephews and niece. \u201cShe was often sad when we were growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cLife was too hard for Ingrid.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the outskirts of Tasiilaq the spongy moss gives way to granite at the town\u2019s graveyard. The Danes here, as in other parts of Greenland, tried to grow vegetables and failed. So they adopted a more realistic goal: converting the locals to Lutheranism. The front row of the cemetery is reserved for the recently departed and a shocking number have young faces staring out from the cracked and weathered picture frames on the low white crosses. Here and there the remains of wreaths, one in the shape of a mobile phone, can be seen. Everywhere plastic flowers flutter in the rising wind.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><strong>We no longer understand it here.</strong> We don\u2019t trust it</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Back in Ilulissat, the distant horizon offers a blood orange streak. It\u2019s finally sunset, but the light never really goes down. I think of Claus Rassmussen\u2019s take on the land, as he had fed his dogs, unsure if he can save them from a bullet in the coming season.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe no longer understand the land here,\u201d Rassmussen had said. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust this rock. We need ice. Now you can have rain in the middle of the winter, and it can even start snowing in August. The frozen sea is what we need. We take our dog sleds on to the sea ice and we cut holes and peer into the ocean and take the same halibut our grandfathers have lived on. This is the balance of the seasons. This is the past.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:17:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Half of greenlanders think the glacier nearest them has retreated\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-09T15:17:18/embed.html\">Half of greenlanders think the glacier nearest them has retreated</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The local testimony from Greenland is not the only harbinger of the crisis across the polar region. Fish migration is changing. Walrus colonies are dwindling. Reindeer herding has become a dangerous business. The 300 reindeers killed by a series of lightning strikes in Norway last year was not an isolated incident. The S\u00e1mi in Finland now talk of pregnant reindeer miscarrying to conserve energy and survive in the confounding new seasons. This means fewer calves join the herd in spring to replace reindeer sold for meat. The death of old ways of surviving.</p> \n<p>Before you reach the frigid grey-blue sea in front of Ilulissat\u2019s social housing blocks you will encounter the K\u00e6ling Gorge, where older members of a nearby settlement once threw themselves to relieve society of their burden. Not far from here is the fjord that calved the iceberg that is believed to have sunk the Titanic. Greenland remains an unforgiving place where community and self-sacrifice remain strong, but nobody knows what dangers lie on the path ahead. </p> \n<p>Across a landscape gripped by an unprecedented heatwave the locals spoke about the beauty of winter with a sad longing. I came here expecting the Inuit to have 500 words for different kinds of snow. But in the case of West Greenland, there are only two that are commonly used. \u201cQanik\u201d, to describe snow in the air, and \u201caput\u201d, to describe snow on the ground. </p> \n<p>There are no local words for climate crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0722ef0c9cde67b7e8cc382771dedd1bd7e5834e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0722ef0c9cde67b7e8cc382771dedd1bd7e5834e/1_0_1918_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Ilulissat, Greenland at dusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>The sun never fully sets in Greenland in the summer months.</strong></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dewald Brand</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/07/arcticle\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Design by: Duarte Carrilho da Gra\u00e7a<br>Photography by: Dewald Brand<br>Production by: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessie-mcdonald\">Jessie McDonald</a><br>Additional production by: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/claudine-spera\">Claudine Spera</a></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 </em><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "A thin blanket of fog curls over the block before it disappears back out to sea. Exhale. Inhale. The freezing breaths of a dormant leviathan \u2013 slumbering somewhere out in the depths. It\u2019s 1am and judging by the flickering glow of televisions in the windows of the bleak two-storey rows facing us, it\u2019s clear that few of the local residents are asleep. Shielded only by flimsy blinds it\u2019s impossible to escape the midnight sun in the northern Greenlandic town of Ilulissat. The light here, some 180 miles north of the Arctic Circle, seeks out every man-made chink and weakness; the cracks and folds of window frames, even the keyholes of doors. Only an hour ago a gang of local children, called in by impatient mothers, finally stopped bouncing on a communal trampoline. At each jump, in the heart of the world\u2019s most remarkably situated public housing complex, they would have glimpsed one of the most incredible views imaginable. Only a large industrial chimney distorts an otherwise unhindered view of Greenland\u2019s Ilulissat ice fjord, the frozen womb that calves 35bn tonnes of icebergs every year and sends them floating silently past, the size of city blocks, towards the northern Atlantic and a meltwater demise. Constructed for coal miners in the late 1970s, the social housing units known locally as \u201cthe white blocks\u201d are, in fact, a broad pallette of colours from blue to green and red. Seal blood and outboard engine oil stains the concrete stairwells. Graffiti \u2013 some of it scrawled in anger \u2013 is political: protesting against Greenland\u2019sstatus as both an autonomous country and a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Away from global headlines about ice cap melt 80km inland from here, this is the frontline of climate change. In Greenland\u2019s working-class housing blocks single mums, fishermen, hotel cleaners, pensioners and hunters have their own fears for the future. Changing climate and the encroachment of the modern age has dramatically impacted the Inuit who live here in Ilulissat, and in other towns across the Arctic. The next generation of Greenlanders face the biggest challenge in the island\u2019s arduous history. Released on Monday, a survey by the University of Copenhagen, the Kraks Fond Institute for Urban Economic Research and the University of Greenland reveals that climate crisis is having an untold psychological effect. In what is broadly accepted as the first nationwide study on local reaction, the Greenlandic Perspectives Survey (GPS) reveals that 92% of residents think that climate change is happening, just 1% of residents do not. A further 76% of local people also claim to have personally experienced the effects \u2013 a damning figure. The survey, covering an area almost three times the size of France and carried out by researchers from the universities of Greenland and Copenhagen, also destroyed a popular myth: that Greenlanders overwhelmingly believe they will benefit from a thaw. Instead, the majority believe it will harm its people, plants and animals. The survey teams travelled by plane, boat and helicopter to reach some of the most hostile and remote locations in the Arctic over the past few months, to map the increasing social anxiety and trauma in Greenland connected to the climate crisis. We understand the ice more than we understand the people Understanding Greenland is impossible unless you look closely at a map. Perched beneath the world\u2019s second-largest ice cap after Antarctica, slivers of land cling to jagged outcrops and natural harbours. Greenland has a compressed and angular coastline, designed to break the ankles and the resolve of potential settlers. Other than black moss and lichen, nothing much grows. Even the delicate summer flowers barely colour the terrain. There is no question, as you travel across it, that this feels like a poor country. The island\u2019s well-documented high rates of unemployment and alcoholism, depression and suicide, remain a huge challenge. Schoolchildren rank abysmally on tests relative to their contemporaries in Denmark. The island\u2019s ice sheet covers 80% of the land. Its centre, which is almost 2 miles thick, generates its own weather system. It is a mass so great that it affects the distribution of the gulf stream in the Atlantic Ocean. The world\u2019s largest island is currently the most topical place on earth. In July temperatures at the highest reaches of the normally frigid interior rose above freezing, melting snow at the Summit Station, 3,200 metres above sea level. Nasa has a semi-permanent presence here and satellites capture the ice melt in real-time and in high resolution. Ice stations across the interior boast scientists from every G20 nation. Greenland\u2019s melting has been adopted as the world\u2019s problem \u2013 not that of the local population of 57,000 people. Voices from the 90% Inuit population have been rarely heard. \u201cIt feels strange to be saying this but when it comes to Greenland we actually understand the ice more than we understand the people,\u201d says Kelton Minor, lead author of the survey. \u201cHistorically, many survey samples of the Greenlandic population were taken from the radius of local airports, which doesn\u2019t give us a picture of a vast and complex country. This is perhaps understandable given the logistical challenges the country presents, but we felt it was both an oversight and an opportunity. There has never been a nationwide survey on climate change perceptions in Greenland\u2019s history. For a nation in the grip of record ice melt, this felt like something that needed to be done.\u201d Minor believes this randomised sample of 2% of the adult population provides indisputable data. \u201cFor the first time, we can begin to understand how the inhabitants of the island most people feel is at the heart of the climate crisis, actually feel about the changing world around them and how it impacts their own culture, food security and state of mind.\u201d More than half of all Greenland residents interviewed report dramatic glacier retreat near their settlements. Perhaps one of the most tragic aspects of the study is the anxiety over the future of a way of life that has endured for a millennium; 67% of residents think that the crisis will harm sled dogs. Despite the advent of supermarkets in larger towns, most Greenlanders still eat wild foods they hunt, fish or gather, and 57% think hunting practices will be harmed. About half, 49%, think fishing will be negatively affected. Eight in 10 Greenland residents believe that in recent years the local sea ice, a key economic and social lifeline in winter, has become too dangerous to travel on. First we teach the children to float. Their limbs jutting out in a star shape For Greenland\u2019s people, the sea ice is everything. When the sea freezes, the polar north expands, offering opportunity as daylight disappears. Greenlanders live their lives stuck between the Arctic Sea and an unforgiving icy interior. With no roads across the glaciers and fjords that separate scattered coastal towns, the freeze offers escape. For as long as the Inuit have been in Greenland, winter has been the time for visits, journeys, and hunts. Dogsleds, snowmobiles, even Japanese-built taxis with snow chains and fuel trucks can skid across frozen water. \u201cThe impact of melting sea ice on the Greenlandic way of life cannot be underestimated,\u201d says Minor. \u201cSea ice is an open highway, traversed by dog sled and snowmobile, connecting citizens to neighbouring communities. An umbilical cord to friends and family in remote rural settlements. When it fails to freeze in winter it\u2019s an obstacle to the community, to society in many ways. The local population goes from being connected to others around them to living on islands, effectively an archipelago given the lack of roads in Greenland. This, in the long term, could bring an enormous challenge to the quality of life. Many of the ice fishermen we met were teaching their children to float if they fall through the water, their limbs jutting out in a star shape. The frozen sea is now a threat.\u201d We are tragically familiar with lean polar bears, unable to stalk seals on flimsy sea ice, invading Arctic settlements for food. Greenland\u2019s people face similar challenges. For a village society whose hunters have long supplied seal meat and halibut in winter, the cold season is becoming a time of fear to step on to the ice. Even the sound of Greenland is changing. Villages once echoed to the howl of sled dogs, but hunters are now turning to desperate measures to keep their family\u2019s heads above water. Shooting your dogs is like killing your own child In Ilulissat, Claus Rassmussen is stirring a foul brew of oily blood and fish. \u201cSeal stew,\u201d the sled-dog hunter says. Strung out in a row, his family carry buckets of the murky soup to feed to the dogs \u2013 a nightly ritual for Rassmussen and his five daughters. Over the past two decades, Greenland\u2019s sled dog population has halved to around 15,000 with the numbers still falling. Greenland\u2019s unique sled dog culture and the specialised training technology and knowledge is in danger of disappearing. An interview with Rassmussen proves more emotional than anticipated. In his modest home, an old wooden cottage among social housing blocks, his face is contorted. Instead of the Greenlandic way \u2013 long silences and monosyllabic answers \u2013 there comes an outpouring. There are six of us crouched in the room, including three of his daughters, as he talks about the decision to kill his beloved dogs because he could no longer afford to feed them. As he talks about shooting one, a dog given the name \u201cmy son\u201d in the local language, the teenagers burst into tears \u2013 a shocking explosion of grief in a culture where emotion is rarely shown. In Inuit culture, strength, silence, and self-sufficiency are admired traits. \u201cI had a blood clot last year and couldn\u2019t hunt,\u201d says Rassmussen. \u201cHere in Ilulissat we have the ice fjord and, for now, it\u2019s strong enough to hold us, but I was unable to walk for nine months. The trouble was nobody wanted my dogs so I had to kill eight of 13. \u201cI killed my favourites. To spare them possible cruelty. That was my decision. The others were given away to people I knew. They weren\u2019t dog people, but were interested in having animals \u2013 but perhaps they weren\u2019t looked after in the way they should\u2019ve been. I managed to take some back and since then I have been building up a new dog team.\u201d For his family, the sea ice is the only lifeline that can get them through the most financially challenging months. Since the age of 12, he has been pulling halibut from the fjord, selling his catch to the town\u2019s fishing factory where it is filleted within two hours and flown to London. With thick fur and strong shoulders, Rassmussen\u2019s dogs are a cold-hardy breed of husky, which the Inuit brought with them when they migrated to Greenland. \u201cIt\u2019s all about money. Unlike dogs, snowmobiles do not need to be raised or fed. We have vet bills. Our dogs are exposed to infectious diseases. The industrial fish waste we once used as dog food is now exported for human consumption. We can\u2019t afford to go on and I worry that I am raising these new dogs only to have them shot again.\u201d The relationship between Rassmussen and his dogs is best revealed in an anecdote from his youth. \u201cI was 12 and out fishing with my stepfather. A storm came in over the ice fjord and the iceberg calved and the sheet began to give way. We knew because the dogs spread themselves wide when the ice starts to go \u2013 to improve the odds of not going under. We could see the animals were worried we were going down into the sea \u2013 they were quiet and they looked to us to save them. There were others stranded out there that night and the helicopter came out from the town to airlift the sled teams. But they told us we couldn\u2019t take the dogs on the winches. I said no to my stepfather. We can\u2019t leave them behind to drown. At 12 I would rather have died than leave them. He agreed with me, but we were sinking. So we fought our way back \u2013 the helicopter above us streaming a path with its lights. We became heroes that night. Putting our dogs first. The Greenlandic way.\u201d As we walk to feed his new crop of huskies, a neighbour runs up to Rassmussen and hands over a bloodied plastic bag of discarded halibut. It is accepted not with thanks, but an understanding that everyone in the community must play a part in the preservation of a way of life. Sled dogs are as much a part of the landscape as the lichen and the sea. Their howls comfort people as the fog rolls in. Anna Martha Larsen, a former social worker, who has lived in the same housing block since it was built, recalls her late husband, a sled-dog fisherman, plying a thriving trade route between Disko Island and Ilulissat, a journey of 50 miles on 2-metre-thick ice. \u201cDespite long summer seasons, fish is getting harder to come by here. It\u2019s abundant, but exported. It\u2019s too expensive. I even see fishermen and their families having poverty problems and nutrition problems. They\u2019re eating more pork and fast food, and there are more and more people with diabetes. We are surrounded by a rich source of protein, yet we can\u2019t afford to eat it fresh. My husband wouldn\u2019t recognise the world we live in here.\u201d Each winter more and more ice journeys fall victim to warming oceans. Disko Bay hunters can no longer lay seal nets under the ice in the 24-hour winter darkness. The Fram Strait, located between Greenland and Svalbard, a crossing for polar bears, has become increasingly treacherous. From Uummannaq ice fjord, transportation to seven local settlements is also no longer possible in winter, neither are crossings of the Inglefield Gulf in the north-west of the island. Greenland\u2019s world is shrinking. Don\u2019t be alone with your dark thoughts For mental health professionals, the survey findings present another red flag for the Arctic\u2019s Inuit communities, already known for its high suicide rate, and historical struggle with depression that is echoed across the region, from Greenland to the S\u00e1mi of northern Finland and Sweden. The main concern in Greenland is the consensus that people who already have mental health problems are more likely to become anxious or depressed, or even traumatised, by events out of their control, like the climate crisis. Dr Courtney Howard, the board president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, works at the intersection between the climate emergency and health in the Arctic. \u201cThere is no question Arctic people are now showing symptoms of anxiety, \u2018ecological grief\u2019 and even post-traumatic stress related to the effects of climate change. The impact of climate change on mental health is a looming public health crisis. So if a Greenland-wide survey points to anxieties around food security and way of life it\u2019s another red line between climate change and mental health,\u201d says Howard. \u201cWe are searching for terms to capture this deep feeling of pain in Arctic nations \u2013 words like eco-anxiety or ecological grief \u2013 but for me, something called \u2018solastalgia\u2019 perfectly sums up how people living on the frontline of climate change feel. It was coined by the Australian environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht. It is also related to an Inuit word that refers to a friend behaving in an unfamiliar way. It means feeling homesick when you are home. Many of these islanders are in mourning for a disappearing way of life.\u201d Howard\u2019s biggest concern is the lack of acknowledgement. \u201cWe are challenging the medical profession to acknowledge the world we are inheriting. Schools and universities aren\u2019t considering how climate change will affect people from a medical or a psychological perspective, so we are not training a new generation of medical professionals to help people in a fast-changing planet, and this is intolerable. We are moving too slowly on this.\u201d In Greenland, health workers believe in a need to work together. In her neat wooden chalet-turned-clinic in Ilulissat, a crayon-etched poster on Astrid Olsen\u2019s wall reads: \u201cNo one is alone. Don\u2019t be alone with your dark thoughts.\u201d Working in mental health among the region\u2019s teenagers for the past three decades, Olsen is part of an emergency response team that helicopters into Greenland\u2019s settlements after suicides to prevent a domino effect of self-harm. She was here in Ilulissat a decade ago when, in relatively short order, eight adolescents in a community of 4,000 people killed themselves. \u201cPeople who are socio-economically disadvantaged, like many people here in Greenland, are also more likely to endure mental health challenges. It\u2019s fair to say many people know a relative or friend who has taken their own life,\u201d says Polsen. \u201cThings have improved in Ilulissat because we have learned from our mistakes but this isn\u2019t the case in rural parts of the country. Many of my colleagues feel climate change is another issue we don\u2019t need here in Greenland. My answer to them is not to be defeated, but to reach out to Canada, Norway and Iceland and find answers together. We are all on this ship.\u201d We call it the flip. This is what we do in summer In the south-east of Greenland the rural population has been shrinking for decades. Young Greenlanders leave small villages for urban centres, in search of educational and occupational opportunities. Far more women leave than men. In Denmark, many Inuit, having left small-town life in Greenland, struggle with prejudice and unemployment. Our local translator describes life in the midnight sun as \u201cthe flip\u201d. \u201cWe live life in reverse,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe play video games and watch Netflix and smoke into the night. Then we sleep all day.\u201d Tasiilaq feels a world away from even Ilulissat. In the coastal town of 1,500 people a minke whale, caught the night before, was sprawled out in the harbour, its blood and guts spilling back into the sea. Here, teenage pregnancy rates are abnormally high and, considering the location, so is drug abuse, particularly growing dependence on cannabis among teenagers. The weekend before our arrival two residents took their own lives. One was Ingrid Korneliussen, 24, who was unemployed and had three children. In recent months the children had been taken from her by the local authorities and placed into foster care. Not entirely unusual. In late July she had visited her brother, Age Korneliussen, at their mother\u2019s home, but he had gone fishing. She killed herself shortly after.. Her other brother, Lars, struggles to articulate his loss. He laughs nervously as he recalls his sister\u2019s love for his nephews and niece. \u201cShe was often sad when we were growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cLife was too hard for Ingrid.\u201d On the outskirts of Tasiilaq the spongy moss gives way to granite at the town\u2019s graveyard. The Danes here, as in other parts of Greenland, tried to grow vegetables and failed. So they adopted a more realistic goal: converting the locals to Lutheranism. The front row of the cemetery is reserved for the recently departed and a shocking number have young faces staring out from the cracked and weathered picture frames on the low white crosses. Here and there the remains of wreaths, one in the shape of a mobile phone, can be seen. Everywhere plastic flowers flutter in the rising wind. We no longer understand it here. We don\u2019t trust it Back in Ilulissat, the distant horizon offers a blood orange streak. It\u2019s finally sunset, but the light never really goes down. I think of Claus Rassmussen\u2019s take on the land, as he had fed his dogs, unsure if he can save them from a bullet in the coming season. \u201cWe no longer understand the land here,\u201d Rassmussen had said. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust this rock. We need ice. Now you can have rain in the middle of the winter, and it can even start snowing in August. The frozen sea is what we need. We take our dog sleds on to the sea ice and we cut holes and peer into the ocean and take the same halibut our grandfathers have lived on. This is the balance of the seasons. This is the past.\u201d The local testimony from Greenland is not the only harbinger of the crisis across the polar region. Fish migration is changing. Walrus colonies are dwindling. Reindeer herding has become a dangerous business. The 300 reindeers killed by a series of lightning strikes in Norway last year was not an isolated incident. The S\u00e1mi in Finland now talk of pregnant reindeer miscarrying to conserve energy and survive in the confounding new seasons. This means fewer calves join the herd in spring to replace reindeer sold for meat. The death of old ways of surviving. Before you reach the frigid grey-blue sea in front of Ilulissat\u2019s social housing blocks you will encounter the K\u00e6ling Gorge, where older members of a nearby settlement once threw themselves to relieve society of their burden. Not far from here is the fjord that calved the iceberg that is believed to have sunk the Titanic. Greenland remains an unforgiving place where community and self-sacrifice remain strong, but nobody knows what dangers lie on the path ahead. Across a landscape gripped by an unprecedented heatwave the locals spoke about the beauty of winter with a sad longing. I came here expecting the Inuit to have 500 words for different kinds of snow. But in the case of West Greenland, there are only two that are commonly used. \u201cQanik\u201d, to describe snow in the air, and \u201caput\u201d, to describe snow on the ground. There are no local words for climate crisis.

NSW police said they had located the pair at 5pm on Monday evening, after they had been separated from their group at 3pm, sparking a huge rescue effort. A spokeswoman said officers were on the ground with the family, who went missing in difficult terrain and deep snow. NSW police said they were \u201csafe and well\u201d. The pair were separated from their group while snowboarding and the father called triple zero at 3.08pm, telling operators they were in deep snow and his phone battery was low. Superintendent Jordan Emery from NSW ambulance told the Sydney radio station 2GB earlier in the afternoon there had been heavy snowfall. He said \u201ca massive effort\u201d between police, Fire and Rescue NSW and Ambulance NSW had been mobilised to rescue the pair. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge dump of snow this afternoon, which is making it challenging,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cOur hearts are in our mouths.\u201d On Monday afternoon a NSW police spokeswoman said they had encountered other snowboarders, who called police.",

There were concerns, too, about the wellbeing of spectators at the same venue, with one reportedly treated for suspected heatstroke. Cost-cutting measures imposed by the Tokyo metropolitan government mean that the grandstand\u2019s roof covers only about half of the 2,000 seats, forcing many at the weekend\u2019s test event to seek shade beneath parasols.

Heatstroke was suspected in the death last week of a worker at an Olympic construction site, as Japan\u2019s sweltering heat killed almost 60 people in the space of a week from the end of July. The 50-year-old construction worker, who had been laying cable outside the Games\u2019 media centre, died in hospital last Thursday after being found unconscious. Temperatures in Tokyo have stayed above 31C since 24 July, exactly a year before the Games are set to open, with the heat intensifying in August to average daily highs of 34.8C. Olympic organisers have said they will introduce measures to deal with the heat, including shaded rest areas, tents at security checkpoints, mist sprays and ice packs.

In the end it was the 21-year-old Aaron Ramsdale, who has been capped at youth level by England and shone in League One with AFC Wimbledon during the second half of last season, who got the nod ahead of Artur Boruc, Mark Travers and Asmir Begovic to make his Bournemouth debut against his former club, having left Sheffield United for around \u00a3800,000 on deadline day in January 2017. At the time Chris Wilder was six months into his dream job \u2013 and about to tie the knot with wife-to-be Francesca. \u201cI sold him an hour before I got married in London,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe tried to balls that up.

However, most weeks they will be playing sides far less good than Liverpool \u2013 for whom they still caused problems with their pacy and purposeful play. Teemu Pukki showed enough, both in front of goal and in general play, to suggest that he belongs in the top division, while Emi Buend\u00eda looks to have the touch and agility necessary to supply him.

They made their presence felt and registered their protest against Mike Ashley\u2019s continued ownership of the club. But still the club were able to announce an attendance of 47,635, just under 5,000 off capacity. That includes season-ticket holders who may not have turned up but, still, despite the filthy weather there did not appear to be more than 6,000\u20117,000 empty seats at St James\u2019. This is a major problem for those who wish to organise protests: it will take far more than that not to turn up before any boycott begins to have an impact and, at the moment, there seems very little appetite for that \u2013 or, at least, there are enough casual fans willing to pick up tickets to counter the recusant hardcore. <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/11/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"><em>Newcastle 0-1 Arsenal</em></a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/11/nicolas-pepe-arsenal-newcastle-united\">Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 cameo gives Arsenal cause for optimism in workaday win| Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8) Heaton looks a bargain among Villa\u2019s many new faces</h2> <p>So how much does \u00a3130m buy you nowadays? Aston Villa fans began to find out after Dean Smith handed out four full debuts and two from the bench of his 12 new faces during this 3-1 defeat. There was Trezeguet, the Egyptian winger, who looked best attuned of all Villa\u2019s forwards to the direct counterattacking Smith wanted from his team. At centre-half Bjorn Engels may not have controlled the means of production but was effective at disruption. Wesley Moraes was Villa\u2019s least effective player and that will surely be a source of concern as \u2013 oddly given the sheer number of recruits at Villa Park \u2013 he was the only striker brought into the club. The Brazilian looked cumbersome, but also lightweight. Finally, there was Tom Heaton, amounting to just \u00a38m of Villa\u2019s summer spending. Not only did the keeper make two stunning saves \u2013 one on either side of his goal \u2013 but his handling, distribution and decision making were 100% Premier League proof. A bargain. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/tottenham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"><em>Tottenham 3-1 Aston Villa</em></a></p> <h2>9) Watford suffering a bit more than an FA Cup final hangover</h2> <p>When Watford lost seven of their final 11 league games last season it seemed reasonable enough to cite their FA Cup run, and insulation from the relegation zone, as the major factors behind their slump. None of that applies to their confused, sluggish performance against Brighton though and Javi Gracia was right to offer no excuses afterwards. \u201cWe need to improve,\u201d he said. His centre\u2011back, Craig Cathcart, dismissed suggestions of a hangover from last season but the biggest concern might be that their dip actually began around March. Gracia has done a fine job, and opening days have a habit of throwing up strange results, but when these sides met a year ago Watford won with ease and they will be wary of discovering that, in the Premier League, the price of sliding backwards is usually exorbitant. Saturday\u2019s meeting with Everton, the kind of club they were more than comfortable measuring themselves against last season, could be telling. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/watford-brighton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"><em>Watford 0-3 Brighton</em></a></p> <h2>10) Mahrez can provide magic in place of unfortunate San\u00e9</h2> <p>Riyad Mahrez had an odd first season at Manchester City.

Mahrez scored some crucial goals for the eventual champions and winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria last month appears to have boosted his confidence. With Guardiola not risking Bernardo Silva because of minor fitness concerns, Mahrez excelled during the 5-0 win over West Ham, laying on a lovely scooped assist for the second of Raheem Sterling\u2019s three goals and winning a penalty for Sergio Ag\u00fcero. It was the kind of performance that made the Algerian a hero at Leicester and it came as a welcome boost for City after losing Leroy San\u00e9 to a serious knee injury. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"><em>West Ham 0-5 Manchester City</em></a><em> </em></p>",

He had been recommended it while on tour and loved it so much, he began posting stills from the show on Instagram with clumsy attempts at London slang (\u201creal bod man\u201d). When he found out it had been cancelled, he decided to bring it back by teaming up with Bennett and pitching it to Netflix.</p> <p>The pair arranged a dinner in London to thrash out a plan \u2013 much to the disbelief of Bennett\u2019s kids, who had to inform him he was about to meet one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. \u201cMy children were like, \u2018Whaaaaat?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t know who he was.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Drake understands the culture.

What was more shocking was that when he posted about Top Boy, the reaction was mad. You\u2019d wake up and have hundreds of messages.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe understands the culture and saw that [the show] needed to come back,\u201d adds Ashley Walters, who plays Dushane, the titular Top Boy who rises from low-level street dealer to potential East End kingpin. \u201cWe were all on the same page \u2013 it just happens that he\u2019s Drake.\u201d</p> <p>Drake fronted a pitch to Netflix in LA and an hour later they had a deal. But Top Boy wasn\u2019t the easiest sell. Originally pitched to the BBC as a one-off TV film, the Beeb balked at the language and its stark gang-related subject matter, so Bennett shopped it to Channel 4, which commissioned it and greenlit a second season.

There is no hope that they will have any understanding of what it would take to solve this problem. They are unbelievably out of touch.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A decade ago, aged 22 and off my face on class A drugs and alcohol almost every day, I would never have seen myself where I am today \u2013 and definitely wouldn\u2019t have dreamed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/birdwatching\">birdwatching</a> would help me to get there.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t even the relentless drinking and drug-taking that shattered my wellbeing. I am sure that instability had been brewing since I was a child, although this is now only being explored properly in my 30s. I have always struggled with obsessive and oppressive thoughts, acute paranoia, desperate mood swings and overblown responses to just about anything and everything. For many years, I was certain that I would take my own life. It was a control thing, something I could always have power over. When intoxicated, I came close many times. On one occasion, I was only stopped by someone who talked me down and begged me to seek help. That moment was the start of my arduous and ongoing recovery journey.</p> <p>How did birdwatching become a part of that journey? In all honesty, it was an accidental discovery \u2013 or, in some ways, a rediscovery. I spent a lot of time as a child in and around Brundall in Norfolk with my maternal grandfather, who instilled in me a love of nature and being outdoors. One of the things Grandad had shared with me was his understanding of avian life and observing it. I distinctly remember him showing me great crested grebes, coots and moorhens; birds that stir and linger in my memory to this day.</p> <p>In 2013, I suffered a breakdown. A breakdown of my resolve and my emotions, it stripped me down to just a husk of a human. The facade I had concocted was crumbling away and the brash, attention-seeking, permanently wasted me had hit crisis point. Rather than go down the usual self-destructive route, I accepted that I needed help and so began my path to something resembling wellness. I was signed off work and during this placid time, I had to get out of the house, so walking became my outlet.</p> <p>One morning, my partner and I were wandering across a stubble field in north-east Norfolk when I became captivated by the buoyant display flight of two common buzzards. Undulating over the tree line, I was struck by their majesty and their freedom. I knew what they were \u2013 Grandad had told me many years ago \u2013 and those echoing memories stirred again. The uplift in my mood was obvious and I wanted to feel it again. Binoculars were bought, along with a few bird books, and the fire was rekindled.</p> <p>It ran alongside other more conventional treatments \u2013 medication, counselling and mindfulness all helped \u2013 but the introduction of birdwatching as a form of self-care was the one consistent change that helped me to find stability. The consistency and stability of nature and its myriad patterns gave me some focus. The natural environments I became interested in offered me the time and space to reflect, not to mention the benefits of being outside. I reached out to people with similar interests, made friends and learned from them. The opportunities to gain and embed knowledge seemed endless: weather patterns, feather markings, suitable habitats and bird migration became topics of interest. Topics to escape into.</p> <p>It is the escapism that any immersive hobby can give us that I found so beneficial to my wellbeing. No matter how difficult things are, I can always stop at my local patch and allow it to overtake my senses and cleanse my mind. The heath in spring is pure multisensory enchantment; the tropical scent of coconut gorse wafts in the warming air, yellow and lurid, the flowers seem to glow in the vernal sunshine. Skylarks serenade from above, each scattering their springtime melody, skittering and bubbling, over the arid landscape. Removing all the complications and expectations of our hectic lives to reveal this innate connection with the land has been a revelation.</p> <p>I wrote in my book<a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/bird-therapy/\" title=\"\"> Bird Therapy</a> that \u201cbirds are consistent in a way that people rarely are\u201d and I stand by this.

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s National Allotments Week, organised by the National Allotment Society, has a theme of shared harvest \u2013 so we\u2019d love to see the bounty you have harvested from your plot, whether it\u2019s fruit, flowers or veg. It doesn\u2019t have to be literal harvest. The bounty from your precious green plot might be a shared cup of tea, or a delicate spider\u2019s web: any opportunity to pause and be grateful for this shared community space, run by local councils. As the society points out, many allotment holders share their produce with local worthy cases. Let us know if you donate your crops to a food bank or work with local groups, and tell us how your allotment has enhanced the health and wellbeing of your family, friends and community. National Allotments Week, which runs from 12-18 August 2019, began in 2002 as a way of raising awareness of allotments and the role they play in helping people to live healthier lifestyles, grow their own food, develop friendships and bolster communities. Every year, we ask Guardian readers to share their pictures of their allotments, and every year, we receive a cornucopia of beautiful photos celebrating readers\u2019 hard work and community spirit on their allotments. Here\u2019s last year\u2019s gallery. Share your photos and stories To celebrate National Allotments Week, we are asking Guardian readers once again to share your pictures of allotments and the wonderful produce you\u2019ve grown. You can share your photographs and tell us a bit about them by using the form below. It would be useful to know where and when the picture was taken. We\u2019ll publish a gallery of some of our favourites and share your stories at the end of August. If you\u2019re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.",

It doesn\u2019t have to be the library \u2013 it could be your room, a coffee shop, or a study area. 5 Time to relax Don\u2019t be afraid to enjoy some free time: not just to take part in clubs, societies and sports, but also to just relax and chill. You\u2019ll struggle to concentrate without it.",

Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.</p>\n    <p>Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d.</p>\n    <p>The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How have the authorities responded?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.</p>\n    <p>Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lily-kuo\">Lily Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\">Verna Yu</a> in Hong Kong</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tam questioned the need for such force in both cases as protesters appeared to be showing \u201cno aggression\u201d towards officers. \u201cThese are all very ugly things,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Pro-democracy street protests in Hong Kong stretched into their 10th week on Monday with no sign of either side backing down.

      "bodyText": "Rights groups and democracy activists have accused police in Hong Kong of using excessive force after teargas was fired into an enclosed subway station and officers posed as protesters before making arrests during an intense weekend of clashes. \u201cClashes between protesters and police over the weekend escalated to another level especially on the police side,\u201d said Man-Kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong. Tam cited video footage of police firing teargas into a subway station on Sunday night in Kwai Fong. It was not clear how many protesters were inside the station at the time, but it has been rare for officers to fire tear gas indoors. He also shared footage of police firing non-lethal projectiles at close range as protesters attempted to flee down a separate subway station escalator. Tam questioned the need for such force in both cases as protesters appeared to be showing \u201cno aggression\u201d towards officers. \u201cThese are all very ugly things,\u201d he said. Pro-democracy street protests in Hong Kong stretched into their 10th week on Monday with no sign of either side backing down. The police have also reported injuries among their ranks, including eye irritation from laser pointers and burns from a petrol bomb. Civil Rights Observer, a local rights group that sends observers to protests, said it had \u201cvery serious concerns\u201d about police violence and had seen \u201cvery clear evidence to show the police are violating their guidelines\u201d, according to its spokesman Icarus Wong. He said the group was particularly concerned by the use of undercover officers for the first time, who later turned on protesters on Sunday night. He said it was unclear if they may have acted as agitators before making mass arrests. During the weekend protests, the website Hong Kong Free Press showed footage of one arrest that appeared to include officers dressing as protesters who injured a demonstrator pressed to the ground. The young man, who said his name was Chow Ka-lok and asked for a lawyer, was left with bleeding head wounds and a broken tooth. Outrage against police violence quickly spread online, where a sit-in at Hong Kong International airport was quickly organised over social media for Monday afternoon. Many residents also shared videos and photos of police violence on Twitter, in some cases under hashtags such as #AbolishHKPF and #HKPoliceState, as well as in Telegram protest groups. One commonly shared photo included an image of a female protester hit by a police projectile and bleeding profusely from her eye. \u201cLet us [admit] HK is a police state. Riot police push down peaceful protestor on the escalator of railway station,\u201d the democracy activist Joshua Wong tweeted. \u201cHong Kong police repeatedly shooting rubber bullets from 1m distance at protesters who are leaving and entering Taikoo MTR station. How is this acceptable behavior?????\u201d Denise Ho, a cantonese pop star turned activist tweeted. Over the weekend journalists were also attacked by mobs of residents believed to be pro-China supporters in one district on Hong Kong island. \u201cViolence against journalists, whether it comes from the police or pro-Beijing mobs, has become systematic and clearly aims to discourage the media from covering the protests in Hong Kong,\u201d said C\u00e9dric Alviani, the head of the Reporters Without Borders East Asia bureau, who called for an independent investigation into protest brutality. On Monday legislators and journalists were also invited to witness a display of police water cannons, which Amnesty warned last week could lead to serious injuries if misused within Hong Kong\u2019s confined spaces. Protests in Hong Kong began in early June against a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China on criminal charges. While Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it was promised semi-autonomy for 50 years including a separate legal system. Many protesters feared the bill, now suspended, would have led to the decline of civil and political rights in the Asian financial hub.",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a new, cheaper way to buy a Sonos wifi speaker and it\u2019s from Ikea.</p> <p>The Symfonisk bookshelf speaker is the second of two new products born of a partnership between the Swedish furniture manufacturer Ikea and the American premium multiroom audio specialists Sonos.</p> <p>Together with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/07/ikea-symfonisk-review-table-lamp-is-also-a-great-sounding-sonos-wifi-speaker\">five-star Symfonisk table lamp,</a> the new bookshelf speaker \u2013 the size of two hardback books \u2013 takes Ikea\u2019s design knowledge and slaps Sonos\u2019s best-in-class wifi speaker platform into it. The result is a new, lower-priced entry point into the Sonos ecosystem costing just \u00a399 and undercutting the Sonos Play:1 by \u00a350.</p> <p>Where the table lamp is more obviously a piece of furniture, the bookshelf speaker is a more traditional audio product, at least on the surface. The plastic casing is available in white with a grey fabric speaker grille or black. A small Ikea-Sonos fabric label pokes out the front at the top, while an LED sits between three buttons taking care of pause/play and volume at the bottom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0bc5b99a5a27783b8349e7f45f14c3c62d06466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0bc5b99a5a27783b8349e7f45f14c3c62d06466/290_407_4170_2502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speaker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The speaker is just at home lying on a surface, mounted to a wall as a shelf or nestled between books.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It can be used as a regular wifi speaker, placed just about anywhere with access to a power socket and set up and operated using Sonos\u2019s excellent system and apps.</p> <p>That means it offers simple multiroom operation with other Sonos-compatible speakers, the ability to stream from any number of 121 different music services or Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2, voice control via Google Home or Amazon Echo and a long history of software and feature updates.</p> <p>You can even pair two of them for stereo separation, and they can be used with a Sonos TV speaker systems as part of a 5.1 surround sound setup.</p> <p>But the speakers can also be either mounted on a rack or turned into a small shelf that can hold up to 3kg of your things using Ikea\u2019s bracket. The back of the speaker has two holes for the mounting bracket, while the power and optional ethernet socket are recessed with cable guides for flush fitting.</p> <p>There\u2019s no rear bass port or vents, meaning as long as the front fabric panel of the speaker isn\u2019t blocked you\u2019ll get the full sound experience.</p> <h2>How it sounds</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0bd4742b82c3b8fb9374778504bb08755d83259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0bd4742b82c3b8fb9374778504bb08755d83259/14_201_4784_2870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speaker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remove the grille to reveal the mid, tweeter and bass port.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In reaching a cost of just \u00a399 something had to be cut, and that something was sound quality. The Symfonisk speaker doesn\u2019t sound quite as good as the \u00a3149 Sonos Play:1 or \u00a3199 Sonos One, or in fact the \u00a3150 Symfonisk table lamp.</p> <p>But it still produces room-filling sound with all the clarity and punch you expect from Sonos, missing a bit of bass and richness you might get with more expensive speakers.</p> <p>The sound is also fairly directional, meaning it suits being placed at one end of the room like a traditional speaker, rather than in the middle of it like many smart speakers.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5135e0b7db3d37456e20650ee35177032ecfb91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5135e0b7db3d37456e20650ee35177032ecfb91/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speaker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Little rubber feet on the bottom and side cater for portrait or landscape orientations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>There are rubber feet on the bottom and side, so you can place it in landscape or portrait orientation.</p></li> <li><p>The fabric speaker grille can be entirely removed to expose the speaker cones and bass port.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Ikea Symfonisk wifi bookshelf speaker costs \u00a399 in either <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/symfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-black-80357557/\">black</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/symfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-white-60435207/\">white</a>.</p> <p>For comparison, the Symfonisk table lamp speaker costs <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/symfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-white-70435160/\">\u00a3150</a>, the Sonos Play:1 speaker costs <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/play1.html\">\u00a3149</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/sonos-one-review-best-smart-speaker-audiophiles-amazon-alexa\">Sonos One</a> costs \u00a3199, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/sonos-play5-review-wireless-wifi-speaker-multiroom-music\">Sonos Play:</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/sonos-play5-review-wireless-wifi-speaker-multiroom-music\">5</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/play5.html\">\u00a3499</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/27/sonos-beam-review-a-great-compact-jack-of-all-trades-upgrade-for-your-tv\">Sonos Beam</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/beam.html\">\u00a3399</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Thanks to Ikea, it\u2019s never been cheaper to buy into the Sonos wifi speaker ecosystem.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a new, cheaper way to buy a Sonos wifi speaker and it\u2019s from Ikea. The Symfonisk bookshelf speaker is the second of two new products born of a partnership between the Swedish furniture manufacturer Ikea and the American premium multiroom audio specialists Sonos. Together with the five-star Symfonisk table lamp, the new bookshelf speaker \u2013 the size of two hardback books \u2013 takes Ikea\u2019s design knowledge and slaps Sonos\u2019s best-in-class wifi speaker platform into it. The result is a new, lower-priced entry point into the Sonos ecosystem costing just \u00a399 and undercutting the Sonos Play:1 by \u00a350. Where the table lamp is more obviously a piece of furniture, the bookshelf speaker is a more traditional audio product, at least on the surface. The plastic casing is available in white with a grey fabric speaker grille or black. A small Ikea-Sonos fabric label pokes out the front at the top, while an LED sits between three buttons taking care of pause/play and volume at the bottom. It can be used as a regular wifi speaker, placed just about anywhere with access to a power socket and set up and operated using Sonos\u2019s excellent system and apps. That means it offers simple multiroom operation with other Sonos-compatible speakers, the ability to stream from any number of 121 different music services or Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2, voice control via Google Home or Amazon Echo and a long history of software and feature updates. You can even pair two of them for stereo separation, and they can be used with a Sonos TV speaker systems as part of a 5.1 surround sound setup. But the speakers can also be either mounted on a rack or turned into a small shelf that can hold up to 3kg of your things using Ikea\u2019s bracket. The back of the speaker has two holes for the mounting bracket, while the power and optional ethernet socket are recessed with cable guides for flush fitting. There\u2019s no rear bass port or vents, meaning as long as the front fabric panel of the speaker isn\u2019t blocked you\u2019ll get the full sound experience. How it sounds In reaching a cost of just \u00a399 something had to be cut, and that something was sound quality. The Symfonisk speaker doesn\u2019t sound quite as good as the \u00a3149 Sonos Play:1 or \u00a3199 Sonos One, or in fact the \u00a3150 Symfonisk table lamp. But it still produces room-filling sound with all the clarity and punch you expect from Sonos, missing a bit of bass and richness you might get with more expensive speakers. The sound is also fairly directional, meaning it suits being placed at one end of the room like a traditional speaker, rather than in the middle of it like many smart speakers. Observations There are rubber feet on the bottom and side, so you can place it in landscape or portrait orientation. The fabric speaker grille can be entirely removed to expose the speaker cones and bass port. Price The Ikea Symfonisk wifi bookshelf speaker costs \u00a399 in either black or white. For comparison, the Symfonisk table lamp speaker costs \u00a3150, the Sonos Play:1 speaker costs \u00a3149, the Sonos One costs \u00a3199, the Sonos Play:5 costs \u00a3499 and Sonos Beam costs \u00a3399. Verdict Thanks to Ikea, it\u2019s never been cheaper to buy into the Sonos wifi speaker ecosystem. While the Symfonisk wifi bookshelf speaker doesn\u2019t quite reach the same audio highs of the Sonos Play:1, it\u2019s also a third cheaper, blends in better with home furnishings and can be mounted in various different and interesting ways. Turning a wall-mounted speaker into a floating shelf is a surprisingly good way of hiding a piece of technology in plain sight, removing clutter in the process. These will make excellent, cost-effective and easy-to-mount rear speakers for a Sonos 5.1 home cinema system with the Beam. While there are definitely better-sounding \u00a3100 speakers available, you\u2019ll struggle to find one that works as well thanks to the Sonos system. The Symfonisk wifi bookshelf speaker is therefore an excellent first step into the highly extensible Sonos ecosystem or an ideal second speaker for another room. Pros: easy setup, flexible mounting, sounds good, Sonos control, wide support for music services, can be paired up, lower cost, optional ethernet. Cons: doesn\u2019t sound as good as a Play:1, no Bluetooth or line in, no built-in smart speaker functionality.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a moment, about six minutes into The Amazing Johnathan Documentary, where its star, a magician, appears to be choking. I say \u201cappears\u201d, because the reality of the scene remains unresolved. The Amazing Johnathan, suffering from a heart condition and with, we\u2019re told, a year or so to live, attempts to swallow the \u201cbane\u201d of his retirement: a large white pill. He heaves, gurgles \u2013 loudly, comically, like a bad actor. Or maybe that\u2019s just what someone dying by pill size sounds like? \u201cAre you joking?\u201d the film\u2019s director, Ben Berman, asks off-camera. No, I\u2019m not, Johnathan sputters, but he\u2019s also smiling.</p> <p>Is he joking? Do you trust what you can see? Such is the confusion of Hulu\u2019s mind-bending The Amazing Johnathan Documentary, a film that is ultimately more a documentary about figuring out what a documentary should be than a profile of the past-his-prime magician from which it takes its name.</p> <p>The Trojan-horsing of subject \u2013 the film is as much about Berman and his motives as documentarian as Johnathan\u2019s final tour \u2013 is a deflection similar to the half-illusion, half darkly comedic stunts The Amazing Johnathan once pulled as a resident performer on the Vegas strip through the \u201990s and early 2000s. In other words, \u201cthere\u2019s bigger things at play in this movie than either a) originally it seems like there will be or b) than the movie tells you that there are\u201d, Berman explained in a recent interview.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ1tzajt2t4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tZ1tzajt2t4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The film opens as a standard profile of a performer in decline \u2013 Johnathan surrounded by memorabilia and stewing in his past glory, listening to Amazon Alexa\u2019s rendition of his Wikipedia summary: \u201cJohnathan Szeles, better known by the stage name the Amazing Johnathan, is an American stand-up comedian/magician \u2026 the self-described \u2018Freddy Kreuger of comedy\u2019, whose hijinks and gleeful gore influenced a generation of Vegas performers.\u201d (Criss Angel, Carrot Top and Penn Jillette all testify to his legacy in the film.) This straight-forward act \u2013 a portrait of an artist in sunset, whose prolific meth use (some on camera, save for a small black box over the pipe) far outpace his remaining years \u2013 lasts for about a third of the film\u2019s 90 minutes.</p> <p>And then, like the magic tricks he sets to capture, Berman turns focus, and the documentary that pitches itself as \u201cMagic. Meth. Mayhem\u201d tilts into ethical confusion. Specifically, Johnathan drops a bomb on his relationship with Berman: five months into filming and two days before the crew is set to fly to Boston for a Johnathan comeback show, the magician informs the documentarian, via phone call replayed in the film, that there will be a second, competing documentary crew in tow.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Johnathan first told me about the second crew, there\u2019s no question that I felt both really sad and confused,\u201d Berman said to the Guardian. \u201cBecause at that point, I thought of Johnathan as my friend, and why would a friend put me at a disadvantage like that?\u201d</p> <p>The new crew came touted by Johnathan as award-winning, launching Berman, a first-time feature filmmaker, into a creative tailspin that steers the remainder of the movie. \u201cStructurally, at that point in the production, I had a decision to make: should I give up and not compete with these film-makers? Or, do I open up the story to include this part of the narrative?\u201d Berman explained of his choice to bring the competition (and its attendant anxieties) in front of the camera. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re boiling down what documentary is, I think it\u2019s an exploration of the truth \u2014 what\u2019s really going on here? So if a documentary is seeking truth and something is going on in my subject\u2019s life, it would be almost unethical to not include that in the movie.\u201d</p> <p>The twist proved creatively fruitful, but also opened up a Pandora\u2019s box of doubt and introspection. Was Johnathan\u2019s diagnosis real? (\u201cEveryone thought that the whole dying bit was a prank,\u201d one friend of Johnathan\u2019s says). Is it unethical to confront him? (\u201cAre you disappointed that I\u2019m not dying in your timeframe?\u201d Johnathan asks Berman). Why does Berman want to film a dying magician? (\u201cI feel bad that I\u2019m using him for his death,\u201d Berman, who brings his chorus of work and personal advisors onscreen, tells his father). Who is using who?

I read it eagerly, hoping that Walden Bello \u2013 one of the leading figures of the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-globalization_movement\" title=\"\"> anti-globalisation movement</a> \u2013 would unmask how China\u2019s financial system is running amok, and how its connections to world finance could potentially trigger the next crash. I was sorely disappointed. Bello may passionately share the general concern about the threat of deregulated global finance, but he knows next to nothing about China. In fact this is a serious case of literary mis-selling. In a book of more than 300 pages, I counted only one section of 14 devoted to China \u2013 and even that is confused and under-researched.

Neoliberalism and Chinese communism, even among its modernisers, are alien bedfellows. The emergent financial crisis in China is not because it gave way to a variant of neoliberalism. The issue is much more fundamental. From the revolution in 1949 right through to today, the communist leadership has used China\u2019s state-owned banks to direct credit to domestic<strong> </strong>enterprises and regions<strong> </strong>to achieve political ends. Because the regime dare not increase tax for the general population for fear of social unrest (given its lack of legitimacy), spending objectives are achieved through bank loans \u2013 so that total bank debt is approaching three times GDP. Very few loans are repaid: interest is only paid on half of them. In western terms, they are non-performing. If the bad debts were ever crystallised, the resulting losses would overwhelm the banks \u2013 and the scale of the necessary recapitalisation of the banks to put them back on their feet would overwhelm the state. Chinese communism would collapse under its own contradictions, and the consequent continental economic calamity would have global consequences.</p> <p>Bello gets near little of this. Of course some in the leadership want to clean up the banks\u2019 balance sheets before the crisis hits, and by quoting them on the Hong Kong stock exchange start the long and painful business of recapitalising via whatever source. Others are more conservative. But this is not a debate within the parameters of neoliberalism, as Bello tries to characterise it. This is about hard-headed realpolitik and regime survival \u2013 about how to escape from 70 years of using the banks as surrogates for public spending.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d5aa209ae4e8c023b30dedab0448b7e5e452eea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d5aa209ae4e8c023b30dedab0448b7e5e452eea/0_168_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional Chinese pavilion on riverfront with skyscrapers behind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China has allowed a shadow banking system to emerge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: aphotostory/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bello at least points to the emergence of a fast-growing shadow banking system, and China\u2019s real estate bubble \u2013 but even here he tries to box the credit creation process into his neoliberal labels.

It seemed too late to apply for the halls at Northumbria and there didn\u2019t appear to be a lot of choice left, so I ended up going for the option of private accommodation.</p> <p>I live in housing run by Unite, in a mixed flat in Newcastle, with eight of us from various universities. It\u2019s not the same as being on campus, which is a 20-minute walk away, because everyone in my building does different things. Being with people from other universities means they have a range of timetables and schedules, which was a bit isolating at first. But it\u2019s interesting to meet everyone. I now have a wider friendship group, and I\u2019m not stuck in the campus bubble.</p> <p>Living in a flat is great, because you get your own community within your building; there are always people you know you can talk to.

Don\u2019t panic \u2013 there are plenty of resources to help you find the right place to live If your university doesn\u2019t have its own halls available, there are still great opportunities for living in private houses in town or in dedicated halls. Websites such as Student.com, Bubble Student and MyStudentHalls.com list private halls and purpose-built student accommodation across the UK. You can also look for your own flat on property sites such as Zoopla or Rightmove. Try Spareroom.com if you\u2019re looking to find a place with housemates. These sites are open to the whole of the property market, not just to students. It\u2019s helpful to search for places online because you can see if the properties have reviews and trusted accreditation, like Anuk, which vets properties and landlords. You can also consult Google reviews, although it\u2019s best not to rely exclusively on these. NL Experience: Kathryn Williams, 20, studies film and TV production at Northumbria University I changed my mind about what course I wanted to do before results day. It seemed too late to apply for the halls at Northumbria and there didn\u2019t appear to be a lot of choice left, so I ended up going for the option of private accommodation. I live in housing run by Unite, in a mixed flat in Newcastle, with eight of us from various universities. It\u2019s not the same as being on campus, which is a 20-minute walk away, because everyone in my building does different things. Being with people from other universities means they have a range of timetables and schedules, which was a bit isolating at first. But it\u2019s interesting to meet everyone. I now have a wider friendship group, and I\u2019m not stuck in the campus bubble. Living in a flat is great, because you get your own community within your building; there are always people you know you can talk to. You build a routine of cooking together and going out together. NL Student essentials Handy hints on what to pack for your new life as a student, from kitchen basics to a mattress topper Accommodation is often quite basic, so it\u2019s important to take items from home to decorate your room, making it feel less temporary. It\u2019s the only space that\u2019s yours, so make it a nice place to come back to. Consider books, fairy lights, photos and posters. Bring a drying rack and coat hangers. Tumble-drying clothes in university accommodation is expensive and time-consuming. The classic doorstop not only means you seem approachable \u2013 it also makes moving things in and out easier. Pack some cutlery and crockery. Not everyone does their washing up and people borrow your things. You don\u2019t want to find yourself without a plate to eat off. If you\u2019re moving into a flat, think about setting up a WhatsApp group with your future housemates, so you can discuss who brings what. You\u2019ll need a four way plug extension lead. There are never enough plugs. A basic medical kit is essential, because you are going to get freshers\u2019 flu: a box of tissues, pain relief, plasters and cough sweets. A pack of cards or board games will come in useful for socialising. They\u2019re also a good icebreaker and fun for nights in or out. As well as your usual electrical items (your phone, a charger, a laptop if you have one, a USB and perhaps even a printer), don\u2019t forget a good old-fashioned notepad and pen. In addition to your favourite bed linen, consider bringing a mattress topper \u2013 mattresses in student halls can be horrible. Some extra cushions can make things comfy too. And lastly, pack a Hawaiian shirt or some daft accessories for fancy dress. You\u2019ll find a use for them, particularly if you join a sports society. TR",

However, a new generation of filmmakers are challenging whose stories deserve to be told and how, such as the director and screenwriter Zoya Akhtar, also a guest at this year\u2019s festival, whose latest feature film, Gully Boy, fictionalises the lives of young Mumbai street rappers who chase dreams of fame while writing and performing music with autobiographical lyrics. It\u2019s been called Bollywood\u2019s first hip-hop film, and would have been unheard of in the industry 20 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe understanding of India is that India is not one thing,\u201d Akhtar says, when asked how international audiences have grown to interpret the subcontinent. \u201cIt\u2019s not a monolith. It\u2019s massive. It\u2019s varied in terms of culture, language, food habits \u2026 So it\u2019s not simple. You can\u2019t just express it in one word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHistorically, our cinema is a unique format: two and a half hours, an interval, not just one single storyline,\u201d Khan says. He believes that will soon change: that with younger Indian filmmakers watching more international cinema, Hindi films will go beyond standard song-and-dance structures. \u201cI think all of that should get made into an international storytelling style. There\u2019s so many more stories for the world to take up. \u2026 We have a great culture of stories in our country. We just need to express them in newer ways so that we get more of an international audience attaching themselves to it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/02/sex-drugs-politics-streaming-netflix-amazon-blowing-up-bollywood\">Sex, drugs, politics: how the streaming giants are blowing up Bollywood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mitu Bhowmick Lange, the director of the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, says that mythology, Bharatanatyam dance techniques, and the tradition of travelling musical theatre is at the root of India\u2019s ancient folklore and cultural identity \u2013 traditions that are far older than the Indian film industry, which dates from the early 1900s. \u201cThat style of storytelling is very ingrained in our culture and in our history. I don\u2019t think that can be removed that quickly or that easily, if at all.\u201d</p> <p>Bhowmick Lange says that it\u2019s those elements of escapism and romance that set Bollywood apart from other kinds of cinema, especially in appealing to its primary audience: everyday Indian citizens. \u201cAt the end of the day, these films are also catering to somebody who is working around 18 hours and earning the equivalent of $2 a day. So that person, too, needs \u2026 three hours away from all their worries,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For Khan though, the dream project is to go right back to the earliest forms of Indian mythology.

Meanwhile, the presence and accessibility of Hindi language films here has only grown: at least 15 Bollywood films have been shot in Australia since the 90s, including 2005\u2019s Salaam Namaste and 2001\u2019s Dil Chahta Hai. Major national cinema chains like Event and Hoyts also curate a rotating selection of the latest Indian movie releases every season. The catalogue of Hindi language films available on major streaming platforms is also growing, dubbing and subtitling breaking down language and cultural barriers for what was once known as foreign cinema. Many early Bollywood films follow a trusted formula: boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, and conflict bubbles as they struggle for family approval. However, a new generation of filmmakers are challenging whose stories deserve to be told and how, such as the director and screenwriter Zoya Akhtar, also a guest at this year\u2019s festival, whose latest feature film, Gully Boy, fictionalises the lives of young Mumbai street rappers who chase dreams of fame while writing and performing music with autobiographical lyrics. It\u2019s been called Bollywood\u2019s first hip-hop film, and would have been unheard of in the industry 20 years ago. \u201cThe understanding of India is that India is not one thing,\u201d Akhtar says, when asked how international audiences have grown to interpret the subcontinent. \u201cIt\u2019s not a monolith. It\u2019s massive. It\u2019s varied in terms of culture, language, food habits \u2026 So it\u2019s not simple. You can\u2019t just express it in one word.\u201d \u201cHistorically, our cinema is a unique format: two and a half hours, an interval, not just one single storyline,\u201d Khan says. He believes that will soon change: that with younger Indian filmmakers watching more international cinema, Hindi films will go beyond standard song-and-dance structures. \u201cI think all of that should get made into an international storytelling style. There\u2019s so many more stories for the world to take up. \u2026 We have a great culture of stories in our country. We just need to express them in newer ways so that we get more of an international audience attaching themselves to it.\u201d Mitu Bhowmick Lange, the director of the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, says that mythology, Bharatanatyam dance techniques, and the tradition of travelling musical theatre is at the root of India\u2019s ancient folklore and cultural identity \u2013 traditions that are far older than the Indian film industry, which dates from the early 1900s. \u201cThat style of storytelling is very ingrained in our culture and in our history. I don\u2019t think that can be removed that quickly or that easily, if at all.\u201d Bhowmick Lange says that it\u2019s those elements of escapism and romance that set Bollywood apart from other kinds of cinema, especially in appealing to its primary audience: everyday Indian citizens. \u201cAt the end of the day, these films are also catering to somebody who is working around 18 hours and earning the equivalent of $2 a day. So that person, too, needs \u2026 three hours away from all their worries,\u201d she says. For Khan though, the dream project is to go right back to the earliest forms of Indian mythology. He says he has long wanted to adapt the Mahabharata, one of the two epic Sanskrit poems based on a sacred Hindu text, for the screen. \u201cLiterature in Hindi, in Sanskrit, I think is amazing. All we need to do is to put it in a uniform which is more internationally accepted. I think it\u2019d be fantastic.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 August 2019 to correct the reference to Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s net worth to being over $600m, from US$6m as an earlier version said.",

Some 20% of doctors who took part said the waiting time for a routine appointment exceeded three weeks, while 5% said it was more than four weeks. The survey published today by the health publication Pulse showed an increase from 2016, when the average wait time was just over 12 days. \u201cPatient demand continues to soar with higher expectations despite dreadful government funding. MPs have a lot to answer for,\u201d said one GP who took part in the survey. NHS England said the results did not tally with official statistics, but Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cPeople are waiting too long for routine appointments, and the concern is that non-serious conditions might deteriorate, or patients give up trying to see the GP and we miss signs of serious illness early when it could be dealt with simply and more cost effectively in primary care.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Royal rant </strong>\u2013 Nigel Farage has derided Prince Harry and his wife for their \u201cirrelevant\u201d social justice and environmental campaigns, has belittled Prince Charles, and called the Queen Mother an \u201coverweight, chain-smoking gin drinker\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/12/nigel-farage-prince-harry-meghan-markle-overweight-queen-mother-cpac-brexit\">in an incendiary speech</a> to an Australian rightwing political conference. The media was barred from the event but, in a recording heard by the Guardian, the Brexit campaigner lauded the Queen as an \u201camazing, awe-inspiring woman\u201d but said of Charles: \u201cWhen it comes to Charlie Boy and climate change, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear,\u201d adding that he hoped the Queen lived for a \u201cvery, very long time\u201d.

Late last night, New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner said an autopsy had been carried out but more information was needed to determine the cause of death. The procedure was carried out by a city medical examiner, with a private pathologist observing at the request of Epstein\u2019s representatives.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Time is running out\u2019</strong> \u2013 MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit face a closing window of opportunity to stop a hard exit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/11/mps-opposing-no-deal-brexit-will-need-new-tactics-report-says\">according to the influential thinktank the Institute for Government</a>. Even bringing down the government would be unlikely to see an election take place in time to change the current course, it says. \u201cMPs looking to force the government into a change of approach face a huge challenge when parliament returns,\u201d says Joe Owen, the institute\u2019s Brexit programme director. \u201cEven if they can assemble a majority for something, they may find few opportunities to make their move \u2013 and time is running out.\u201d MPs who oppose a no-deal would \u201cneed new tactics\u201d to actually block it, given the lack of Brexit-related legislation on which to tack amendments or new motions. Simply passing motions opposing no deal would not be enough, the report argues.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Britons have spent a staggering \u00a34bn stockpiling goods in case of a no-deal Brexit, according to a survey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/12/britons-have-spent-4bn-stockpiling-goods-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit\">by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/12/britons-have-spent-4bn-stockpiling-goods-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit\"> finance provider Premium Credit</a>.

Labour\u2019s David Lammy said the findings from the new data, recorded between April 2018 and March 2019, revealed an abuse of power. \u201cThis paints a hugely chilling picture that appears to go far beyond reasonable and proportionate force.\u201d Home Office policy states that there is a presumption against the use of restraint, but in 335 cases, more than one form of restraint was used. In nearly a quarter of cases, three different pieces of restraint equipment were used.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Gambling problem </strong>\u2013 Complaints about British betting companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/12/complaints-against-betting-firms-up-almost-5000-in-five-years\">have increased by almost 5,000% over five years</a>, with problem gamblers alleging that bookies continue to entice them to bet even after they have pleaded to be left off mailing lists.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Patients should be able to see a GP when they need to\u2019 Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke. A survey of more than 900 GPs has found the average waiting time to see a doctor has exceeded two weeks for the first time. Some 20% of doctors who took part said the waiting time for a routine appointment exceeded three weeks, while 5% said it was more than four weeks. The survey published today by the health publication Pulse showed an increase from 2016, when the average wait time was just over 12 days. \u201cPatient demand continues to soar with higher expectations despite dreadful government funding. MPs have a lot to answer for,\u201d said one GP who took part in the survey. NHS England said the results did not tally with official statistics, but Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cPeople are waiting too long for routine appointments, and the concern is that non-serious conditions might deteriorate, or patients give up trying to see the GP and we miss signs of serious illness early when it could be dealt with simply and more cost effectively in primary care.\u201d * * * Royal rant \u2013 Nigel Farage has derided Prince Harry and his wife for their \u201cirrelevant\u201d social justice and environmental campaigns, has belittled Prince Charles, and called the Queen Mother an \u201coverweight, chain-smoking gin drinker\u201d in an incendiary speech to an Australian rightwing political conference. The media was barred from the event but, in a recording heard by the Guardian, the Brexit campaigner lauded the Queen as an \u201camazing, awe-inspiring woman\u201d but said of Charles: \u201cWhen it comes to Charlie Boy and climate change, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear,\u201d adding that he hoped the Queen lived for a \u201cvery, very long time\u201d. Other media outlets reported that Farage also described Harry as \u201cthe prince of wokeness\u201d. * * * Epstein autopsy \u2013 The fallout from the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who is accused of sex trafficking, has intensified, with three separate jurisdictions now conducting investigations. Late last night, New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner said an autopsy had been carried out but more information was needed to determine the cause of death. The procedure was carried out by a city medical examiner, with a private pathologist observing at the request of Epstein\u2019s representatives. * * * \u2018Time is running out\u2019 \u2013 MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit face a closing window of opportunity to stop a hard exit, according to the influential thinktank the Institute for Government. Even bringing down the government would be unlikely to see an election take place in time to change the current course, it says. \u201cMPs looking to force the government into a change of approach face a huge challenge when parliament returns,\u201d says Joe Owen, the institute\u2019s Brexit programme director. \u201cEven if they can assemble a majority for something, they may find few opportunities to make their move \u2013 and time is running out.\u201d MPs who oppose a no-deal would \u201cneed new tactics\u201d to actually block it, given the lack of Brexit-related legislation on which to tack amendments or new motions. Simply passing motions opposing no deal would not be enough, the report argues. Meanwhile Britons have spent a staggering \u00a34bn stockpiling goods in case of a no-deal Brexit, according to a survey by finance provider Premium Credit. It found one in five people are already hoarding food, drinks and medicine, spending an extra \u00a3380 each, and about 800,000 people have spent more than \u00a31,000 building up stockpiles before the 31 October deadline. As the possibility of a general election remains in play, Boris Johnson has set out a resoundingly tough stance on law and order, with a trio of announcements on extending jail terms, building new prisons and increasing police stop-and-search powers, saying punishments must \u201ctruly fit the crime\u201d. * * * \u2018Chilling\u2019 deportations \u2013 Nearly 450 people deported from the UK were restrained by a variety of methods including shackles, the Guardian has learned. Labour\u2019s David Lammy said the findings from the new data, recorded between April 2018 and March 2019, revealed an abuse of power. \u201cThis paints a hugely chilling picture that appears to go far beyond reasonable and proportionate force.\u201d Home Office policy states that there is a presumption against the use of restraint, but in 335 cases, more than one form of restraint was used. In nearly a quarter of cases, three different pieces of restraint equipment were used. * * * Gambling problem \u2013 Complaints about British betting companies have increased by almost 5,000% over five years, with problem gamblers alleging that bookies continue to entice them to bet even after they have pleaded to be left off mailing lists. The figures, obtained by BBC Panorama from the Gambling Commission regulator, showed there were a record 8,266 complaints in 2018, compared with just 169 in 2013. Today in Focus podcast: Meghan Markle: why all the hate? Victoria Murphy discusses why the Duchess of Sussex has been subjected to a sustained campaign of criticism from sections of the media and the public. Plus: Malachi O\u2019Doherty on 50 years since the start of the Troubles. Lunchtime read: Joseph Fiennes on the Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Trump When The Handmaid\u2019s Tale first appeared on our screens in 2017, it was a bit like having an anxiety dream about the new politics, as Donald Trump settled in to the White House. The programme\u2019s makers understood immediately that they had done something prescient. \u201cWe got lucky with the zeitgeist,\u201d says Joseph Fiennes, who describes his character, Fred, as \u201cpathetic\u201d and a role that gave him licence to illustrate the \u201cpatheticness of misogyny\u201d. \u201cHis [Fred\u2019s] voicelessness: that, for me, describes the man. There are brutal acts he didn\u2019t command to happen, but he didn\u2019t stand up. The last thing I want to do is talk Handmaid\u2019s and then Trump\u2019s administration, but somehow you can\u2019t not equate some things. So you look at those Republican leaders who are not standing up, and they are all Fred.\u201d Sport Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r praised Manchester United\u2019s \u201crisk and reward\u201d play as Chelsea were torn apart during two breathtaking minutes at Old Trafford. Eddie Jones has warned that the forthcoming World Cup in Japan could be \u201cdestroyed\u201d by inconsistent refereeing, in an unprovoked rant at World Rugby following England\u2019s comprehensive victory in their opening warmup Test at Twickenham. Nerveless throughout the season, Jamie Chadwick did just enough at Brands Hatch to claim the championship title of the inaugural season of the W Series after a race that left her fraught and frayed at the edges. Andy Murray, on the eve of his return to singles competition for the first time since his hip resurfacing surgery six months ago, was relaxed as he discussed his comeback in the Cincinnati Masters 1000 with an encouraging mixture of hope and perspective. Bianca Andreescu delivered Canada a home champion at the Rogers Cup in Toronto but her victory did not come in the way she may have hoped after a tearful Serena Williams had to retire with a back injury in the first set. And Simone Biles executed a triple double en route to becoming the first woman in nearly 70 years to win a sixth US gymnastics title.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest companies, investors and pension funds must come clean to investors on the financial risks they face due to the climate crisis, MPs have said. The environmental audit committee (EAC) has called for the City of London to face mandatory climate reporting within the next three years to avoid jeopardising hundreds of billions of pounds worth of pension savings. The cross-party committee of MPs criticised ministers for failing to take specific steps to drive forward climate disclosure plans, despite publicly supporting international recommendations. The MPs urged the government \u201cto clarify in law\u201d that pension funds have a duty to take into account long-term environmental risks to protect their savers. The report comes just weeks after the Treasury outlined plans to force firms and funds to show how the climate emergency could jeopardise their finances. The committee said it did not believe a voluntary approach would be effective and instead called for climate risk reporting to be mandatory on a \u201ccomply or explain\u201d basis by the same deadline. The new plans would take effect by 2022 and include financial services firm, too. Mary Creagh, who chairs the committee, said: \u201cClimate change poses financial risks to a range of investments \u2013 from food and farming, to infrastructure, construction and insurance liability.\u201d The committee\u2019s report on \u201cgreening finance\u201d found that the UK\u2019s financial investment chain was \u201cstructurally incentivised\u201d to prioritise short-term profits rather than long-term issues including the climate crisis. \u201cWe need to fix the incentives in our financial system that encourage short-term thinking. Long-term sustainability must be factored into financial decision making,\u201d Creagh said. \u201cWe want to see mandatory climate risk reporting and a clarification in law that pension trustees have a duty to consider long term sustainability, not just short-term returns.\u201d The growing calls for mandatory climate reporting come after the government legislated an economy-wide target to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. Creagh said the low-carbon transition \u201calso presents exciting opportunities in clean energy, transport and tech that could benefit UK businesses\u201d. \u201cProper recognition and disclosure of these risks and opportunities would help financial markets work more efficiently and will enable UK institutions and investors to position themselves to benefit from the low-carbon transition,\u201d the report added. The committee also called for pension savers to have a say about how their money is invested by forcing pension funds to actively seek the views of their beneficiaries when they set their investment principles. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has warned that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must \u201craise the bar\u201d to avoid catastrophe. Writing an open letter in the Guardian in April, Carney and Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, urged financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, and called for a \u201cmassive reallocation of capital\u201d to prevent global warming above the 2\u00b0C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement. \u201cIf some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,\u201d they said.

How much do I have in my bank account?\u201d NatWest is to begin voice-only banking that will give customers direct access to their accounts by talking to the Google Home smart speakers now in millions of British homes.</p> <p>The trial \u2013 the first by a UK high street bank \u2013 will let customers ask Google \u201cWhat\u2019s my balance?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s my latest transactions?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s my pending transactions\u201d.

How much do I have in my bank account?\u201d NatWest is to begin voice-only banking that will give customers direct access to their accounts by talking to the Google Home smart speakers now in millions of British homes. The trial \u2013 the first by a UK high street bank \u2013 will let customers ask Google \u201cWhat\u2019s my balance?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s my latest transactions?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s my pending transactions\u201d. Google devices will answer verbally, and also flash the answers up on the customer\u2019s smartphone. While only basic account information will be available under the trial, NatWest said the technology may in future allow customers to instantly transfer money and pay bills simply by talking to Google devices. To access their account, NatWest customers will have to say out loud two digits from a new four-digit password, in a move that will inevitably raise fresh fears about security and privacy. Last month, it emerged that Google contractors are able to listen to recordings of what people say to the company\u2019s artificial-intelligence system, Google Assistant. NatWest said that customers would only be able to start quizzing Google after separately setting up voice banking through their existing online banking password and then obtaining a new four-digit voice pin which would be different from their debit card pin. It added that Google would not store the customer\u2019s ultimate banking password. The trial will only run over Google devices, not Alexa or Siri. The bank admitted some customers may be put off by the prospect of their account information being broadcast across a room. \u201cOther people in the area will be able to hear your balance, which is something you will want to take into consideration,\u201d said a spokesman.

      "body": "<p>One of the first things you see as you enter Bogside is a 20ft mural of a 12-year-old boy, wearing a gas mask and clutching a petrol bomb.</p> <p>Painted on the side of a social housing property, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the violence that tore Derry apart during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/14/how-a-protest-about-internment-in-northern-ireland-led-to-bloody-sunday\">the Troubles</a>. One of a series of 12 murals telling the story of Bloody Sunday, the day in 1972 when the British army opened fire at a protest, shooting and mortally wounding 14 innocent civilians, it depicts the battle of the Bogside, a 1969 riot between mostly Catholic residents and police drawn almost exclusively from Protestant and unionist backgrounds.</p> <p>This week marks 50 years since the battle, and Tom Kelly, one of the Bogside artists who painted the mural in the early 1990s, says his image shows \u201ca community standing up for basic civil and human rights\u201d. It is not intended to be partisan, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as violent or sinister.\u201d</p> <p>When it first went up, however, Kelly says it was heavily criticised in both the Times and the Irish Times for glorifying pre-teen violence. The Bogside murals have remained divisive ever since, not just among Protestants but among local Catholics and republicans who want to shake off the legacy of the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fd96f1f0c2898740aae57b6947fca4cd79a59b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fd96f1f0c2898740aae57b6947fca4cd79a59b5/0_155_4302_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists on a walking tour pass a mural depicting Bloody Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists on a walking tour pass a mural depicting Bloody Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They have now also become something else: a tourist attraction. A recent <a href=\"https://tourismni.com/globalassets/facts-and-figures/research-reports/tourism-performance-statistics/visitor-attitude-surveys/visitor-attitude-survey-2018.pdf\">NI Tourism report</a> puts political murals as the eighth most visited attraction in the entire country. The neighbouring Museum of Free Derry, which tells the story of Bloody Sunday, attracted 35,000 visitors in 2018. According to the tourist board, all coach tours to the city now stop at the murals.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the local council doubled down. It took a controversial step: it would encourage this so-called \u201cTroubles tourism\u201d by providing funding to illuminate the murals at night.</p> <p>The head of culture for the Derry and Strabane Council, Aeidin McCarter, says the illuminations are the first step in a wider project to identify murals and monuments that could contribute to Derry\u2019s tourist potential and encourage a better understanding of the city\u2019s more recent history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e6f3855ffc05040a7800ea1e9c189685fbcf717f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f3855ffc05040a7800ea1e9c189685fbcf717f/0_0_2996_4016/746.jpg\" alt=\"A recent mural, painted on the headquarters of dissident republican group Saoradh.\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A recent mural, painted on the headquarters of dissident republican group Saoradh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an issue the tourism industry across Northern Ireland is grappling with: how do we develop this product sensitively and ethically?\u201d McCarter says.</p> <p>\u201cMany people would love to think the content of the murals is consigned to history, and it\u2019s becoming more and more ancient history, but the reality is some of those issues are still prevalent in society,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have the answers to whether [the murals] support or help that move from a conflict society or whether they don\u2019t, but that\u2019s part of the discussion we have around them.\u201d</p> <p>Some critics say illuminating the murals simply keeps old wounds open. Jeanette Wark, project manager of the Cathedral youth club in the nearby Protestant enclave of Fountain, finds the Bogside murals \u201coffensive\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t amused at [the council] putting lights on them,\u201d she says, and argues that the murals only show one side of the story, omitting how Protestant families had to abandon their homes, and ignoring recent history.</p> <p>Indeed, the Troubles are far from consigned to the past. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/19/derry-woman-killed-in-terrorist-act-say-northern-ireland-police\">killing in April</a> of the journalist Lyra McKee in the nearby Creggan neighbourhood, where she was observing police raids on republican dissidents, was a reminder that Derry hasn\u2019t completely eradicated violence.</p> <p>New murals, meanwhile, are popping up all the time, including one on the headquarters of dissident republican group Saoradh, featuring balaclava-clad gunmen and the slogan \u201cunfinished revolution\u201d. After McKee\u2019s murder, friends <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/watch-friends-of-lyra-mckee-place-red-handprints-at-saoradh-hq-in-derry-38038597.html\">painted red handprints</a> on the mural in protest against the group\u2019s links to her death.

That\u2019s precisely why the city wants to get involved, says Odhran Dunne, head of the Visit Derry tourist board. He argues that the local community should take the lead on any Troubles tourism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53255212690bb3875500781e960ff6ca48c44074\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53255212690bb3875500781e960ff6ca48c44074/0_165_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New political messages and republican recruitment posters alongside the Bogside murals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New political messages and republican recruitment posters alongside the Bogside murals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEveryone has a different take on [the Troubles story], but that\u2019s what visitors are looking for, that authentic experience, to feel it, touch it, see it from people who\u2019ve lived it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat better way to do that than take a guide who\u2019s locally based taking you into a community who has a story to tell?\u201d</p> <p>Paul Doherty is one such community tour operator. He prefaces his visit to the Bogside murals with a personal story: his father was among those who died on Bloody Sunday. As such, he says his tour isn\u2019t the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d version of events, but inflected with his own impassioned views, as well as a counterpoint to Northern Ireland\u2019s frequent media portrayal as a country of \u201cmad people bombing and shooting each other\u201d.</p> <p>Doherty\u2019s tour ends outside the Bloody Sunday Museum, where a relative of someone killed then is always made available to tell visitors their personal story. The museum received an award for its authenticity in the 2018 <a href=\"https://nitourismawards.com/ni-tourism-awards-2018-winners/\">NI tourism awards</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb8dd42adac113f0ff4879ae651232bd0260532b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb8dd42adac113f0ff4879ae651232bd0260532b/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the Bogside murals sharing a space with a modern republican poster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Bogside murals sharing a space with a modern republican poster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Kelly is one of them: he watched his brother\u2019s body be carried away after he was shot by British soldiers. He argues that the museum adds to the understanding of Bogside. \u201cWe find that people from Great Britain haven\u2019t got a clue, they have no idea what happened here,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the time we see emotions, tears. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Troubles tourism isn\u2019t new in Northern Ireland. It first took off in the early 2000s, says Dominic Bryan, a lecturer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. \u201cPeople realised that with peace, tourism was on the agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cThe history is literally painted on the wall, in the memorials. The story of republicanism and loyalism as a narrative is being told all around you. It\u2019s very visual: it\u2019s fantastic to do a tour.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike murals painted by the IRA or paramilitary groups, the Bogside murals are not affiliated to any political group. Nevertheless, they have been politicised by becoming a \u201cfocal point for protest\u201d, says Sara McDowell, a lecturer at Ulster University.</p> <p>\u201cThese murals are not passive, they don\u2019t just exist there, they\u2019re active spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cDo they serve to educate people about the past, or do they transfer this sense of trauma and this specific narrative on to new generations?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"885810a35faf6efea2570430f7a640a63ff0ddcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/885810a35faf6efea2570430f7a640a63ff0ddcc/0_494_3009_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bogside murals are not affiliated to any political group, unlike this loyalist mural, set next to a curb painted in the red white and blue of the British flag.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"782\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bogside murals are not affiliated to any political group, unlike this loyalist mural, set next to a curb painted in the red white and blue of the British flag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McDowell said that research by one her PhD students indicates that \u201cconflict architecture\u201d, such as so-called peace walls or murals, correlates with high levels of depression in surrounding communities. \u201cBut there\u2019s very little qualitative research done on what it\u2019s like to live in these communities with these constant reminders of a very traumatic past,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Community-led political tourism can be problematic because \u201coften you have an individual or a small group of people who talk about the experience of all the community, when communities aren\u2019t monolithic or homogenous\u201d, McDowell says. In divided societies, community tourism can also be used by certain groups to \u201clegitimise [their] narrative and claim victimhood\u201d.</p> <p>Wark, of the Cathedral youth club, says that instead of Troubles tourism led by individuals, she would like to see shared narratives of the recent history developed, and greater cross-community work.</p> <p>One organisation doing just that is UV Arts, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2018/sep/16/more-new-radicals-2018-observer-nesta-social-enterprise-innovation-awards\">award-winning </a>social enterprise that uses street art to engage at-risk young people.

      "bodyText": "One of the first things you see as you enter Bogside is a 20ft mural of a 12-year-old boy, wearing a gas mask and clutching a petrol bomb. Painted on the side of a social housing property, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the violence that tore Derry apart during the Troubles. One of a series of 12 murals telling the story of Bloody Sunday, the day in 1972 when the British army opened fire at a protest, shooting and mortally wounding 14 innocent civilians, it depicts the battle of the Bogside, a 1969 riot between mostly Catholic residents and police drawn almost exclusively from Protestant and unionist backgrounds. This week marks 50 years since the battle, and Tom Kelly, one of the Bogside artists who painted the mural in the early 1990s, says his image shows \u201ca community standing up for basic civil and human rights\u201d. It is not intended to be partisan, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as violent or sinister.\u201d When it first went up, however, Kelly says it was heavily criticised in both the Times and the Irish Times for glorifying pre-teen violence. The Bogside murals have remained divisive ever since, not just among Protestants but among local Catholics and republicans who want to shake off the legacy of the past. They have now also become something else: a tourist attraction. A recent NI Tourism report puts political murals as the eighth most visited attraction in the entire country. The neighbouring Museum of Free Derry, which tells the story of Bloody Sunday, attracted 35,000 visitors in 2018. According to the tourist board, all coach tours to the city now stop at the murals. Earlier this year, the local council doubled down. It took a controversial step: it would encourage this so-called \u201cTroubles tourism\u201d by providing funding to illuminate the murals at night. The head of culture for the Derry and Strabane Council, Aeidin McCarter, says the illuminations are the first step in a wider project to identify murals and monuments that could contribute to Derry\u2019s tourist potential and encourage a better understanding of the city\u2019s more recent history. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue the tourism industry across Northern Ireland is grappling with: how do we develop this product sensitively and ethically?\u201d McCarter says. \u201cMany people would love to think the content of the murals is consigned to history, and it\u2019s becoming more and more ancient history, but the reality is some of those issues are still prevalent in society,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have the answers to whether [the murals] support or help that move from a conflict society or whether they don\u2019t, but that\u2019s part of the discussion we have around them.\u201d Some critics say illuminating the murals simply keeps old wounds open. Jeanette Wark, project manager of the Cathedral youth club in the nearby Protestant enclave of Fountain, finds the Bogside murals \u201coffensive\u201d. \u201cWe weren\u2019t amused at [the council] putting lights on them,\u201d she says, and argues that the murals only show one side of the story, omitting how Protestant families had to abandon their homes, and ignoring recent history. Indeed, the Troubles are far from consigned to the past. The killing in April of the journalist Lyra McKee in the nearby Creggan neighbourhood, where she was observing police raids on republican dissidents, was a reminder that Derry hasn\u2019t completely eradicated violence. New murals, meanwhile, are popping up all the time, including one on the headquarters of dissident republican group Saoradh, featuring balaclava-clad gunmen and the slogan \u201cunfinished revolution\u201d. After McKee\u2019s murder, friends painted red handprints on the mural in protest against the group\u2019s links to her death. They were swiftly painted over. There are also new political messages near the Bogside murals proper: recruitment posters for the Irish Republican Socialist Party, which believes a united Ireland can only be achieved through armed action; another poster glorying the Irish Republican Army terrorist group as \u201cthe people\u2019s army\u201d; and fresh graffiti expressing disillusion with Sinn Fein, the nationalist political party, for \u201cturning rebellion into money\u201d. Tourists from around the world visit this area every day and see those murals. That\u2019s precisely why the city wants to get involved, says Odhran Dunne, head of the Visit Derry tourist board. He argues that the local community should take the lead on any Troubles tourism. \u201cEveryone has a different take on [the Troubles story], but that\u2019s what visitors are looking for, that authentic experience, to feel it, touch it, see it from people who\u2019ve lived it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat better way to do that than take a guide who\u2019s locally based taking you into a community who has a story to tell?\u201d Paul Doherty is one such community tour operator. He prefaces his visit to the Bogside murals with a personal story: his father was among those who died on Bloody Sunday. As such, he says his tour isn\u2019t the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d version of events, but inflected with his own impassioned views, as well as a counterpoint to Northern Ireland\u2019s frequent media portrayal as a country of \u201cmad people bombing and shooting each other\u201d. Doherty\u2019s tour ends outside the Bloody Sunday Museum, where a relative of someone killed then is always made available to tell visitors their personal story. The museum received an award for its authenticity in the 2018 NI tourism awards. John Kelly is one of them: he watched his brother\u2019s body be carried away after he was shot by British soldiers. He argues that the museum adds to the understanding of Bogside. \u201cWe find that people from Great Britain haven\u2019t got a clue, they have no idea what happened here,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the time we see emotions, tears. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d Troubles tourism isn\u2019t new in Northern Ireland. It first took off in the early 2000s, says Dominic Bryan, a lecturer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. \u201cPeople realised that with peace, tourism was on the agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cThe history is literally painted on the wall, in the memorials. The story of republicanism and loyalism as a narrative is being told all around you. It\u2019s very visual: it\u2019s fantastic to do a tour.\u201d Unlike murals painted by the IRA or paramilitary groups, the Bogside murals are not affiliated to any political group. Nevertheless, they have been politicised by becoming a \u201cfocal point for protest\u201d, says Sara McDowell, a lecturer at Ulster University. \u201cThese murals are not passive, they don\u2019t just exist there, they\u2019re active spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cDo they serve to educate people about the past, or do they transfer this sense of trauma and this specific narrative on to new generations?\u201d McDowell said that research by one her PhD students indicates that \u201cconflict architecture\u201d, such as so-called peace walls or murals, correlates with high levels of depression in surrounding communities. \u201cBut there\u2019s very little qualitative research done on what it\u2019s like to live in these communities with these constant reminders of a very traumatic past,\u201d she says. Community-led political tourism can be problematic because \u201coften you have an individual or a small group of people who talk about the experience of all the community, when communities aren\u2019t monolithic or homogenous\u201d, McDowell says. In divided societies, community tourism can also be used by certain groups to \u201clegitimise [their] narrative and claim victimhood\u201d. Wark, of the Cathedral youth club, says that instead of Troubles tourism led by individuals, she would like to see shared narratives of the recent history developed, and greater cross-community work. One organisation doing just that is UV Arts, an award-winning social enterprise that uses street art to engage at-risk young people. The collective paints murals throughout the city in an attempt to find new ways of expressing Northern Irish identity that avoid both sectarian connotations and imagery linked to the Irish and British flags. One mural in the Fountain is a multi-coloured images of bagpipers, celebrating the community\u2019s links with Scottish culture; in Bogside, a Housing Executive commission carries an environmental message; another tells the story of the Irish famine through abstract imagery that recognises suffering without being explicit. An upcoming mural will commemorate the women who worked in their husband\u2019s jobs during the Troubles. \u201cWe\u2019re quite unique here in this part of the world that people accept large-scale murals,\u201d says Donal O\u2019Doherty, one of the artists. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this tradition, saying that we love it, but we\u2019re dragging it into the future.\u201d Karl Porter, another artist, agrees. \u201cIn Northern Ireland there\u2019s a massive trend for figurative stuff, illustrating what happened \u2013 it\u2019s very literal,\u201d he says. \u201cWhereas we\u2019re trying to push more of a contemporary twist.\u201d Porter notes that the whole reason the political murals existed in the first place is that communities felt they didn\u2019t have a platform to express themselves. At the same time, he worries that celebrating the Bogside murals could entrench difference in an already deeply divided society. \u201cBeing surrounded by very harsh political murals the whole time, and particularly a petrol bomber \u2013 what\u2019s that going to do the development of a young person? It\u2019s subliminal messaging. Is that OK?

      "body": "<p>\u2018It\u2019s alluded to in the novel \u2026 someday, something will happen to Fred. Quite soon.\u201d In a neutral-looking cafe in central London, Joseph Fiennes is talking about the future of his role in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. \u201cWhy, though?\u201d I plead with him. \u201cWhy does he have to die?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s in the novel,\u201d Fiennes explains very patiently. \u201cHe\u2019s got to. Come on, there are some very angry women in red out there.\u201d</p> <p>When The Handmaid\u2019s Tale first appeared on our screens in 2017, it was a bit like having an anxiety dream about the new politics, your subconscious supplying the sharp contrasts and glorious Technicolor, the brutally formal sexual violence and the intricate dystopian detail. There was a watchful intelligence in all the performances \u2013 particularly Elisabeth Moss as June/Offred, Fiennes as Fred and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena, his wife \u2013 which was arresting, and left you vaguely unsettled for a long time after each episode.</p> <p>The programme\u2019s makers understood immediately that they had done something prescient, but played down the political parallels in favour of the idea that this was just great drama that happened to arrive at the same time as Donald \u201cpussy grabbing\u201d Trump took office in the White House. (Nick Lee, who acquired the show for Channel 4 in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/haunting-chillingly-plausible-peerless-how-the-handmaids-tale-changed-tv\" title=\"\">said at the time</a>: \u201cWhether the original commissioners at Hulu had read those tealeaves or not, the drama is so compelling and the story so powerful that even without the parallels, it would still be a standout drama.\u201d)</p> <p>Seasons two and three have been even more chilling, and, in a sense, much more literal; partly because the writing has diverged from Margaret Atwood\u2019s original and partly because the political context is so much darker. You can feel as if you are watching not a drama, but a public information warning. It repeatedly raises the question: at what point in the totalitarian journey do you run, and when is it too late?</p> <p>Fiennes\u2019s performance has become commensurately darker; his reading of the state of the real world is also pretty dark. \u201cWe knew at the start that the previous handmaid took her own life,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I always used that as a basis for how dark that household was. He was pretty dark to begin with.\u201d But Fiennes is playing something subtler than just any villain. \u201cReally, Fred is pathetic. His voicelessness: that, for me, describes the man. There are brutal acts he didn\u2019t command to happen, but he didn\u2019t stand up. The last thing I want to do is talk Handmaid\u2019s and then Trump\u2019s administration, but somehow you can\u2019t not equate some things. So you look at those Republican leaders who are not standing up, and they are all Fred.\u201d It is a fascinating role to be in, acting the human weakness that enables the great disasters of history, as history unfolds before our eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55761eefe44dd041493d5ee2e9737c336ba28948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55761eefe44dd041493d5ee2e9737c336ba28948/99_0_2912_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Yvonne Strahovski in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Yvonne Strahovski in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a scene we shot on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. You think about the Gettysburg speech and all that engenders, and the flag of Martin Luther. And you look from 1863 to 1963, and then to our dystopian future \u2013 Margaret Atwood\u2019s future \u2013 and then at what\u2019s going on in the administration today. Everything that went before, to build a government for the people, is now being torn down. And Gilead takes it down in flames. So, yes,\u201d he finishes with grim irony. \u201cWe got lucky with the zeitgeist.\u201d</p> <p>And Fiennes, 49, takes it extremely seriously. In season two, there was a scene filmed in which Fred raped his wife during their visit to Washington, and he argued so strenuously against the plotline that it was dropped. \u201cI felt that Yvonne had made such a beautiful, delicate trajectory of her character, it didn\u2019t need a brutal rape to recoil back and find her hatred.\u201d But more than that, \u201cit just felt like an idea to push the misogyny. And I felt it was all already there. It didn\u2019t need to be so brutally illustrated.\u201d</p> <p>The whole age, he says, has that \u201c30s or 40s air of: whose side are you on?\u201d OK, there probably wouldn\u2019t be many actors (Charlton Heston, perhaps?) on the other side, but he clearly feels very keenly the responsibility, not just to take a side, but to fight it intellectually with everything he has. \u201cIn America, I\u2019m careful not to talk too much about their politics,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Whether Americans can read what he says about them here and elsewhere isn\u2019t a concern for his future prospects. But surely he must know when his stint on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale will end just to plan his next job? \u201cI don\u2019t plan. I\u2019m lucky to be working \u2026 I don\u2019t have a choice, I\u2019m not picking between the cherries six months or a year in advance.\u201d<strong> </strong>Many actors, apart from the ones who have won Oscars, make this point \u2013 that three-quarters of them are out of work at any one time and some of them never work at all. Yet they are propelled by their vocation to never stop trying. How you deal with this, he says, \u201cdepends on if you feel you\u2019re doing it to pay the bills or because you have to do it. There are the wannabes and the has-to-bes, and there are those that just have to.\u201d This sounds to me like the most preposterous distinction ever. Before you have to act, you have to eat, unless, for personal wealth reasons, you think of bill-paying as something quite secondary.</p> <p>But I\u2019m making a mistake about Fiennes that people have been making about all seven of the siblings since the first (Ralph) became famous: that they grew up with these perfect, gilded prospects and went on to live perfect, gilded lives. (His father was a freelance photographer, and his mother a writer and painter.) It is an error made in good faith, since they are all incredibly successful (two actors, two directors, a composer, a conservationist and an archaeologist) and then there is that family tree, packed with industrialists, brigadiers, explorers \u2013 not putting too fine a point on it, the kind of jobs extremely posh people have. \u201cIt\u2019s a name, isn\u2019t it? I remember my mum being furious with publishers who wanted to use her married name because that would help the sale, and her just being so furious, all the time. The name can throw people off a bit, belie the truth.\u201d He looks dismayed at having to explain this again, which is fair. \u201cI understand it, if you don\u2019t really look at the person and just look at the name. It\u2019s easier to navigate the world and the people in it. It\u2019s all easier with stereotypes, and everything is so immediate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f498c3fe53abcde5ab21770409b6a64016ab373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f498c3fe53abcde5ab21770409b6a64016ab373/273_11_1781_1068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I was growing up, there were seven children and no real income. We grew up with debt. I grew up seeing that stress, and it has definitely informed me.\u201d They moved constantly from one place they could almost afford to a cheaper place, 14 times during his childhood (or 12 times and 14 schools, he can\u2019t quite recall which), but that, he says, almost as a throwaway remark, wasn\u2019t the worst of it. We are discussing childhood idylls, places to which he feels rooted by landscape (the West Country, Norfolk), when he says: \u201cI\u2019ve got a problem with authority, but that\u2019s to do with nuns in West Cork in the 70s. But don\u2019t go into that.\u201d Wait, why not? He takes a swerve which sounds like the end of it. \u201cI got into television, really, through Ryan Murphy, the creator of Glee and American Horror Story \u2026 a brilliant television creative. Anyway, we did a film called Running With Scissors, it was sort of about Augusten Burroughs. And we improvised a scene in that \u2013 it was very cathartic \u2013 in which I got to write a poem about being beaten by nuns with bamboo. But anyway, I digress.\u201d</p> <p>Before Fiennes got into television, he had carved a striking early career as a romantic lead, beginning with the 1998 film Shakespeare in Love, which he played with such ease, mischief, energy, familiarity and assertive anti-respect that from then on, he seemed to be the go-to actor for English cultural history. \u201cI\u2019m just very lucky. Just lucky, lucky, lucky. I\u2019d been working in the theatre for a bit, but I\u2019d only been out of drama school maybe five years \u2026 and, yes, I\u2019d been doing bits for the RSC, but spear-carrying bits.\u201d He didn\u2019t capitalise on the film as a Hollywood calling card, perhaps inevitably, since he, as he puts it, \u201cwent to drama school because I wanted to do theatre, not film. I had no compulsion to do film and television. It was radio and stage \u2013 don\u2019t laugh at radio.\u201d I\u2019m not laughing. \u201cI love radio. It\u2019s the most difficult medium out there.\u201d And while most actors\u2019 heads are turned by adulation, he remains apparently immune to fame, and is rather sceptical about film. (Although he spent his 20s \u201cjumping from one independent film to another, and I loved the freedom\u201d.)</p> <p>Asked whether he has defected, since The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019s success, from the stage to the screen, he is unexpectedly old-school. \u201cI think theatre will survive and cinema will die. Theatre has a social necessity; we need to get out, to integrate, socially, emotionally, on a human level. I\u2019d love to think cinema won\u2019t die, but I think it already has. With streaming platforms, phones and iPads. When\u2019s the last time you went to the cinema?\u201d I actually saw Toy Story 4 the night before. \u201cMy kids [who are seven and nine] haven\u2019t seen any Toy Story films. Well, they tried one, it just didn\u2019t lock in. It was cowboys and astronauts \u2026 they didn\u2019t feel the connection.\u201d This stuns me. What kind of freaks has he raised? \u201cOriginal freaks.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, Maria Dolores Dieguez, is also an actor, and the family lives in Canada seven months of the year, with Fiennes creating fresh horrors in Gilead (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is filmed there), and the kids learning the Canadian national anthem and how to play hockey. \u201cPeter Ustinov said Toronto was like New York run by the Swiss. And that\u2019s true. Canadians are a lovely bunch. The crew is the best I\u2019ve worked with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a15d97168dacfcaa6a1495a4c587dee3b5db5bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a15d97168dacfcaa6a1495a4c587dee3b5db5bd/0_5_5792_3475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Weirdly enough, the best experience I had at the RSC was doing a Dennis Potter play.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Weirdly enough, the best experience I had at the RSC was doing a Dennis Potter play.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He loves all his co-stars, directors and costume designers, but is distrustful of the way things are going,<strong> </strong>especially in relation to box sets. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a better time for creative staff, whether you\u2019re a writer, producer, director or actor. It feels as if with streaming platforms, there\u2019s a lot more need for content. Is the development process rigorous enough to meet this need? This appetite for content, content, content. How can anyone binge The Handmaid\u2019s Tale? I don\u2019t know how you do it without watching comedies in between, but this sense of bingeing all the time \u2026 it\u2019s great.\u201d His face is saying it isn\u2019t great. Really loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s the insatiableness. I love to go and see a Robert Lepage trilogy and then spend a week talking about it, breaking it down. We\u2019re always on to the next meal. We\u2019re missing that discussion between the meals.\u201d I call this an ascetic stance, and he\u2019s not sure about that, says he has never thought about himself in that way. But what I mean, rather, is that it\u2019s redolent of that disgust at comfort, and hatred of indulgence and of gorging \u2013 he uses the word gorge quite a lot \u2013 that belongs to a different time. He seems, himself, to belong to a different time.</p> <p>He disputes, too, the idea that in quality terms, this is TV\u2019s golden age. \u201cWeirdly enough, the best experience I had at the RSC was doing a Dennis Potter play. Everyone talks about The Sopranos being the moment that television defined itself, but sorry, you know, The Singing Detective, Pennies from Heaven, the whole thing about breaking the fourth wall. Look at the real House of Cards. The first one [broadcast in 1990]. All these things we talk about had been done already.

      "bodyText": "\u2018It\u2019s alluded to in the novel \u2026 someday, something will happen to Fred. Quite soon.\u201d In a neutral-looking cafe in central London, Joseph Fiennes is talking about the future of his role in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. \u201cWhy, though?\u201d I plead with him. \u201cWhy does he have to die?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s in the novel,\u201d Fiennes explains very patiently. \u201cHe\u2019s got to. Come on, there are some very angry women in red out there.\u201d When The Handmaid\u2019s Tale first appeared on our screens in 2017, it was a bit like having an anxiety dream about the new politics, your subconscious supplying the sharp contrasts and glorious Technicolor, the brutally formal sexual violence and the intricate dystopian detail. There was a watchful intelligence in all the performances \u2013 particularly Elisabeth Moss as June/Offred, Fiennes as Fred and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena, his wife \u2013 which was arresting, and left you vaguely unsettled for a long time after each episode. The programme\u2019s makers understood immediately that they had done something prescient, but played down the political parallels in favour of the idea that this was just great drama that happened to arrive at the same time as Donald \u201cpussy grabbing\u201d Trump took office in the White House. (Nick Lee, who acquired the show for Channel 4 in the UK, said at the time: \u201cWhether the original commissioners at Hulu had read those tealeaves or not, the drama is so compelling and the story so powerful that even without the parallels, it would still be a standout drama.\u201d) Seasons two and three have been even more chilling, and, in a sense, much more literal; partly because the writing has diverged from Margaret Atwood\u2019s original and partly because the political context is so much darker. You can feel as if you are watching not a drama, but a public information warning. It repeatedly raises the question: at what point in the totalitarian journey do you run, and when is it too late? Fiennes\u2019s performance has become commensurately darker; his reading of the state of the real world is also pretty dark. \u201cWe knew at the start that the previous handmaid took her own life,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I always used that as a basis for how dark that household was. He was pretty dark to begin with.\u201d But Fiennes is playing something subtler than just any villain. \u201cReally, Fred is pathetic. His voicelessness: that, for me, describes the man. There are brutal acts he didn\u2019t command to happen, but he didn\u2019t stand up. The last thing I want to do is talk Handmaid\u2019s and then Trump\u2019s administration, but somehow you can\u2019t not equate some things. So you look at those Republican leaders who are not standing up, and they are all Fred.\u201d It is a fascinating role to be in, acting the human weakness that enables the great disasters of history, as history unfolds before our eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene we shot on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. You think about the Gettysburg speech and all that engenders, and the flag of Martin Luther. And you look from 1863 to 1963, and then to our dystopian future \u2013 Margaret Atwood\u2019s future \u2013 and then at what\u2019s going on in the administration today. Everything that went before, to build a government for the people, is now being torn down. And Gilead takes it down in flames. So, yes,\u201d he finishes with grim irony. \u201cWe got lucky with the zeitgeist.\u201d And Fiennes, 49, takes it extremely seriously. In season two, there was a scene filmed in which Fred raped his wife during their visit to Washington, and he argued so strenuously against the plotline that it was dropped. \u201cI felt that Yvonne had made such a beautiful, delicate trajectory of her character, it didn\u2019t need a brutal rape to recoil back and find her hatred.\u201d But more than that, \u201cit just felt like an idea to push the misogyny. And I felt it was all already there. It didn\u2019t need to be so brutally illustrated.\u201d The whole age, he says, has that \u201c30s or 40s air of: whose side are you on?\u201d OK, there probably wouldn\u2019t be many actors (Charlton Heston, perhaps?) on the other side, but he clearly feels very keenly the responsibility, not just to take a side, but to fight it intellectually with everything he has. \u201cIn America, I\u2019m careful not to talk too much about their politics,\u201d he says. Whether Americans can read what he says about them here and elsewhere isn\u2019t a concern for his future prospects. But surely he must know when his stint on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale will end just to plan his next job? \u201cI don\u2019t plan. I\u2019m lucky to be working \u2026 I don\u2019t have a choice, I\u2019m not picking between the cherries six months or a year in advance.\u201d Many actors, apart from the ones who have won Oscars, make this point \u2013 that three-quarters of them are out of work at any one time and some of them never work at all. Yet they are propelled by their vocation to never stop trying. How you deal with this, he says, \u201cdepends on if you feel you\u2019re doing it to pay the bills or because you have to do it. There are the wannabes and the has-to-bes, and there are those that just have to.\u201d This sounds to me like the most preposterous distinction ever. Before you have to act, you have to eat, unless, for personal wealth reasons, you think of bill-paying as something quite secondary. But I\u2019m making a mistake about Fiennes that people have been making about all seven of the siblings since the first (Ralph) became famous: that they grew up with these perfect, gilded prospects and went on to live perfect, gilded lives. (His father was a freelance photographer, and his mother a writer and painter.) It is an error made in good faith, since they are all incredibly successful (two actors, two directors, a composer, a conservationist and an archaeologist) and then there is that family tree, packed with industrialists, brigadiers, explorers \u2013 not putting too fine a point on it, the kind of jobs extremely posh people have. \u201cIt\u2019s a name, isn\u2019t it? I remember my mum being furious with publishers who wanted to use her married name because that would help the sale, and her just being so furious, all the time. The name can throw people off a bit, belie the truth.\u201d He looks dismayed at having to explain this again, which is fair. \u201cI understand it, if you don\u2019t really look at the person and just look at the name. It\u2019s easier to navigate the world and the people in it. It\u2019s all easier with stereotypes, and everything is so immediate. \u201cWhen I was growing up, there were seven children and no real income. We grew up with debt. I grew up seeing that stress, and it has definitely informed me.\u201d They moved constantly from one place they could almost afford to a cheaper place, 14 times during his childhood (or 12 times and 14 schools, he can\u2019t quite recall which), but that, he says, almost as a throwaway remark, wasn\u2019t the worst of it. We are discussing childhood idylls, places to which he feels rooted by landscape (the West Country, Norfolk), when he says: \u201cI\u2019ve got a problem with authority, but that\u2019s to do with nuns in West Cork in the 70s. But don\u2019t go into that.\u201d Wait, why not? He takes a swerve which sounds like the end of it. \u201cI got into television, really, through Ryan Murphy, the creator of Glee and American Horror Story \u2026 a brilliant television creative. Anyway, we did a film called Running With Scissors, it was sort of about Augusten Burroughs. And we improvised a scene in that \u2013 it was very cathartic \u2013 in which I got to write a poem about being beaten by nuns with bamboo. But anyway, I digress.\u201d Before Fiennes got into television, he had carved a striking early career as a romantic lead, beginning with the 1998 film Shakespeare in Love, which he played with such ease, mischief, energy, familiarity and assertive anti-respect that from then on, he seemed to be the go-to actor for English cultural history. \u201cI\u2019m just very lucky. Just lucky, lucky, lucky. I\u2019d been working in the theatre for a bit, but I\u2019d only been out of drama school maybe five years \u2026 and, yes, I\u2019d been doing bits for the RSC, but spear-carrying bits.\u201d He didn\u2019t capitalise on the film as a Hollywood calling card, perhaps inevitably, since he, as he puts it, \u201cwent to drama school because I wanted to do theatre, not film. I had no compulsion to do film and television. It was radio and stage \u2013 don\u2019t laugh at radio.\u201d I\u2019m not laughing. \u201cI love radio. It\u2019s the most difficult medium out there.\u201d And while most actors\u2019 heads are turned by adulation, he remains apparently immune to fame, and is rather sceptical about film. (Although he spent his 20s \u201cjumping from one independent film to another, and I loved the freedom\u201d.) Asked whether he has defected, since The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019s success, from the stage to the screen, he is unexpectedly old-school. \u201cI think theatre will survive and cinema will die. Theatre has a social necessity; we need to get out, to integrate, socially, emotionally, on a human level. I\u2019d love to think cinema won\u2019t die, but I think it already has. With streaming platforms, phones and iPads. When\u2019s the last time you went to the cinema?\u201d I actually saw Toy Story 4 the night before. \u201cMy kids [who are seven and nine] haven\u2019t seen any Toy Story films. Well, they tried one, it just didn\u2019t lock in. It was cowboys and astronauts \u2026 they didn\u2019t feel the connection.\u201d This stuns me. What kind of freaks has he raised? \u201cOriginal freaks.\u201d His wife, Maria Dolores Dieguez, is also an actor, and the family lives in Canada seven months of the year, with Fiennes creating fresh horrors in Gilead (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is filmed there), and the kids learning the Canadian national anthem and how to play hockey. \u201cPeter Ustinov said Toronto was like New York run by the Swiss. And that\u2019s true. Canadians are a lovely bunch. The crew is the best I\u2019ve worked with.\u201d He loves all his co-stars, directors and costume designers, but is distrustful of the way things are going, especially in relation to box sets. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a better time for creative staff, whether you\u2019re a writer, producer, director or actor. It feels as if with streaming platforms, there\u2019s a lot more need for content. Is the development process rigorous enough to meet this need? This appetite for content, content, content. How can anyone binge The Handmaid\u2019s Tale? I don\u2019t know how you do it without watching comedies in between, but this sense of bingeing all the time \u2026 it\u2019s great.\u201d His face is saying it isn\u2019t great. Really loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s the insatiableness. I love to go and see a Robert Lepage trilogy and then spend a week talking about it, breaking it down. We\u2019re always on to the next meal. We\u2019re missing that discussion between the meals.\u201d I call this an ascetic stance, and he\u2019s not sure about that, says he has never thought about himself in that way. But what I mean, rather, is that it\u2019s redolent of that disgust at comfort, and hatred of indulgence and of gorging \u2013 he uses the word gorge quite a lot \u2013 that belongs to a different time. He seems, himself, to belong to a different time. He disputes, too, the idea that in quality terms, this is TV\u2019s golden age. \u201cWeirdly enough, the best experience I had at the RSC was doing a Dennis Potter play. Everyone talks about The Sopranos being the moment that television defined itself, but sorry, you know, The Singing Detective, Pennies from Heaven, the whole thing about breaking the fourth wall. Look at the real House of Cards. The first one [broadcast in 1990]. All these things we talk about had been done already. I think TV back in the 80s was really exciting.\u201d For all of that, you can\u2019t miss the pleasure and pride he takes in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, even while he takes his future demise with equanimity, even while he can see it may have an impact on what he does next. \u201cI\u2019ll only get misogynist roles for ages. I\u2019m waiting for someone to slap or punch me in the street. I\u2019m waiting for someone to be really disturbed by Fred because I\u2019m really disturbed by him.\u201d Wherever it has gone, the conversation returns, irresistibly, to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, mainly because I can\u2019t stop ruminating about its impact. \u201cThere are fans of the book, and there are people who discovered the book through the show, but what I think about is those young folks dressing up as handmaids in Alabama, silently protesting [against their new, very restrictive abortion legislation]; you feel as if you\u2019re in something very important and very pertinent to people. So it\u2019s great. At least I\u2019ve done my bit for society, I\u2019ve illustrated the patheticness of misogyny. Fred is very thinly illustrated in the book, so I didn\u2019t know how it would open up. It\u2019s luck, I think.

There is no question about it compared to what they put in,\u201d Hollissaid.</p> <p>Vertex argues it has invested $11.8bn in the research and development of cystic fibrosis drugs, but, said Hollis, that was a strategy for making more money.</p> <p>\u201cYou put all this money into R&amp;D because it has been enormously profitable for you and you think you are going to be able to charge a lot of money in the future. If you choose to take your money and reinvest it in something, it doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t make profits,\u201d said Hollis.</p> <p>Pharma watchers believe the strategy will pay off. Vertex is developing a triple combination drug, which includes two of the medicines already on the market with a third it is developing. The drugs only work in a limited proportion of cystic fibrosis cases, but the triple is expected to benefit 90% of patients. <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/thought-leadership/pharma/evaluatepharma-world-preview-2019-outlook-2024\">Evaluate Pharma\u2019s World Preview 2019</a>, released last month, predicted that Vertex\u2019s triple combination would make more money than any other drug for any condition in the pipeline: $20bn over its lifetime.</p> <p>Vertex\u2019s latest financial results, for the second quarter of 2019, show product revenues are up 25% from last year, with an increase in the expected revenue for the whole year from $3.6bn to $3.7bn.</p> <p>Orkambi and the other cystic fibrosis drugs made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/27/600-years-supply-of-cystic-fibrosis-drug-destroyed-in-price-row\">Vertex</a> are the first that target the underlying causes of the genetic disease that clogs children\u2019s and young adults\u2019 lungs and shortens lives.

In fact, the pharmaceutical trade body said the current offer represents exactly the sort of flexibility industry wants and warned companies they cannot just pick any price they like for a new medicine.\u201d</p> <p>Vertex said it disagreed with Hollis\u2019s paper. \u201cWe have been relentless in our pursuit of a cure for cystic fibrosis and invested significantly in this area when other companies would not because the risk was too high,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cVertex scientists have worked for over 20 years to do what was once thought impossible\u2014develop medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis.</p> <p>\u201cSince 2000, Vertex\u2019s investment in drug discovery research and development has totalled $11.8bn.

Deducting Vertex\u2019s costs, he calculates the figure to be $21.1bn. \u201cThey are earning profits on those drugs. There is no question about it compared to what they put in,\u201d Hollissaid. Vertex argues it has invested $11.8bn in the research and development of cystic fibrosis drugs, but, said Hollis, that was a strategy for making more money. \u201cYou put all this money into R&amp;D because it has been enormously profitable for you and you think you are going to be able to charge a lot of money in the future. If you choose to take your money and reinvest it in something, it doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t make profits,\u201d said Hollis. Pharma watchers believe the strategy will pay off. Vertex is developing a triple combination drug, which includes two of the medicines already on the market with a third it is developing. The drugs only work in a limited proportion of cystic fibrosis cases, but the triple is expected to benefit 90% of patients. Evaluate Pharma\u2019s World Preview 2019, released last month, predicted that Vertex\u2019s triple combination would make more money than any other drug for any condition in the pipeline: $20bn over its lifetime. Vertex\u2019s latest financial results, for the second quarter of 2019, show product revenues are up 25% from last year, with an increase in the expected revenue for the whole year from $3.6bn to $3.7bn. Orkambi and the other cystic fibrosis drugs made by Vertex are the first that target the underlying causes of the genetic disease that clogs children\u2019s and young adults\u2019 lungs and shortens lives. The parents of children who could benefit from the treatment are distressed by the delay, aware that children do better the sooner they can get the drug. Rob Long, who has been buying Orkambi privately for his nine-year-old son Aidan, says he is appalled by the high prices of the drugs from a company making such profits. \u201cIt\u2019s the obscene face of capitalism, where a drug company makes up its prices based on what it thinks it can get away with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe present system is broken and not working. There needs to be an independent system of fair evaluation and binding arbitration to ensure lives are put before profit. The present situation is nothing short of torture and there is a UN convention against that. \u201cVertex is consistently considered an outlier, even by the pharmaceutical industry, so the current situation is intolerable. With no end in sight, how can the government allow this impasse to continue. So far, over 250 have died who could have been helped.\u201d NHS England said it was still in negotiations with the company. \u201cNHS has made two of the most generous offers of its kind to this company and intensive work continues on a daily basis but the quickest way for patients to get access to Orkambi is still for Vertex to accept our offer and engage with Nice,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cVertex is an extreme outlier in both pricing and behaviour. In fact, the pharmaceutical trade body said the current offer represents exactly the sort of flexibility industry wants and warned companies they cannot just pick any price they like for a new medicine.\u201d Vertex said it disagreed with Hollis\u2019s paper. \u201cWe have been relentless in our pursuit of a cure for cystic fibrosis and invested significantly in this area when other companies would not because the risk was too high,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cVertex scientists have worked for over 20 years to do what was once thought impossible\u2014develop medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. \u201cSince 2000, Vertex\u2019s investment in drug discovery research and development has totalled $11.8bn. In fact, between 2012 and 2017 our research and development costs represented over 70% of our total operating expenses. \u201cThe price of our medicines is based on the value they bring and the difference they make to patients\u2019 lives, their families and societies, as well as the significant R&amp;D investment we have made to develop them and our commitment to finding future treatments. As our medicines treat the underlying cause of disease they not only treat the symptoms but also impact long-term progression.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019 to correct a quote.",

      "bodyText": "Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing struggles to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria could be routinely replicated in other places if the climate crisis spurs nationalistic governments to scale back aid to certain disaster victims. That\u2019s a warning from bestselling author David Wallace-Wells, whose book The Uninhabitable Earth was described in a Guardian review as a \u201cbrutal portrait of climate change\u201d. The indifference of US politicians to the Hurricane Maria disaster is chilling, he warns. Maria smashed into Puerto Rico in September 2017, killing about 3,000 people, crippling the power grid and devastating the island\u2019s agriculture and tourism industries. The US government\u2019s sluggish response to the disaster was found to be deficient in an official report, with many Puerto Ricans claiming the federal government has been indifferent to their plight. The island has since been racked with dysfunction and political turmoil, leading to the recent departure of the governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3. As global heating fuels more powerful hurricanes, as well as rising sea levels, drought and wildfires, more people around the world will be in need of assistance at a time when populist, nationalist leaders have gained prominence in several countries including the US, where Donald Trump gained infamy in Puerto Rico for visiting the island and throwing paper towels at hurricane survivors. \u201cWhat really stands out to me about Maria is the indifference of much American power to suffering even to those within its borders, seeing those people as somehow less American and less deserving,\u201d said Wallace-Wells. \u201cIn the US we often find ways to turn away from people suffering in places like Mozambique or Bangladesh. The harrowing thing about Puerto Rico is that even American citizens were defined as undeserving. It\u2019s horrifying and ugly on its own terms on a moral level but also as a glimmer of the way we will respond to these disasters down the road. \u201cWe are already seeing more intense competition for resources and focusing our investments and political sympathies closer and closer to home. It\u2019s concerning because all suffering in the world now has some sort of climate fingerprint.\u201d Wallace-Wells is one of the leading figures to have attended the second annual International Congress of Youth Voices, held this year in Puerto Rico\u2019s capital San Juan. The summit, founded by the author Dave Eggers and the not-for-profit leader Amanda Uhle, has attracted around 150 international students, mostly aged between 16 and 20 years old, to meet with various writers, politicians and activists. Last year\u2019s congress, held in San Francisco, drew young people from places including the US, Sweden, Iraq, Australia, Zambia and Nepal. The climate crisis is one of the leading issues discussed at the congress, amid a broader movement of young activists around the world who have taken to striking from school or shutting down areas of cities to demand that elected leaders do more to curb global heating. A figurehead for this insurrection is Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who sparked the school strike movement. Thunberg has been feted by several national leaders and will attend the upcoming UN climate summit in New York City. Given her aversion to flying due to the associated carbon pollution, Thunberg will reach New York via solar powered boat. Wallace-Wells said the youth climate movement was \u201cinspiring and exhilarating and also a little surprising\u201d. \u201cA year ago I\u2019d say I would be sceptical that there would be a mass protest movement on climate,\u201d he said. \u201cNow in the immediate aftermath of the IPCC report in October we are seeing much more commitment, concentrated among young people, and I think that\u2019s fantastic. That young people have such clear, unarguable moral standing really does change the landscape of climate politics.\u201d In the US, young climate activists have faced a political class that is still unclear over its response to the escalating crisis. In February, veteran Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein was videoed rebuffing pleas from young people to implement the Green New Deal, a platform to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions supported by progressive Democrats. \u201cI think that encounter would be very different it it happened today, quite a lot has changed even in that time,\u201d Wallace-Wells said. \u201cMore people are focused on these issues, even those on the right are making rhetorical gestures. \u201cI think we\u2019ve already passed a tipping point.

      "body": "<p>When Boris Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin prime minister on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/09/russia.marktran\" title=\"\">9 August 1999</a>, few Russians knew much about him. In early television appearances he came across as mousy, shy and awkward, a man unaccustomed to the limelight from which his previous career in the KGB had shielded him.</p> \n<p>But within weeks he revealed a character trait that would become the defining feature of his rule \u2013 ruthlessness. His first memorable phrase was his threat to wipe out terrorists \u201ceven if they\u2019re in the shithouse\u201d, and within weeks he had launched a terrifying war against separatists in Chechnya that would leave tens of thousands of civilians dead.</p> \n<p>Twenty years on, as Russia and the west teeter towards confrontation, it is hard to remember that Putin started out as an avowedly pro-western leader. George W Bush and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/11/russia.ethicalforeignpolicy\" title=\"\">Tony Blair rushed to glad-hand him</a>, and Putin himself stood in the Bundestag proclaiming at length and in fluent German that Russia\u2019s destiny was in Europe. But western leaders were appalled by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/05/russia.chechnya\" title=\"\">brutality in Chechnya</a>, and by the first signs of his antidemocratic tendencies, which included his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/23/media.russia\" title=\"\">muzzling of critical television stations</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If the west can invade Iraq with impunity \u2013 so Putin reasons \u2013 then Russia can help out its mate in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Putin\u2019s fatal flaw, it seemed to me, was his utter inability to see that there was a contradiction between being a ruthless autocrat at home, and the values of the western civilisation to which he (at least at that time) paid lip service.</p> \n<p>Some argue that he was never seriously pro-western, that the overtures masked ulterior motives and KGB-inspired schemes to dominate the world. But I think that is mistaken. When I worked as a consultant to the Kremlin in the earlier part of Putin\u2019s rule, I had many meetings with senior officials and have no doubt that they regarded themselves as \u201cwestern\u201d and even as democrats.</p> \n<p>The problem lay elsewhere \u2013 in Putin\u2019s inability to understand the west\u2019s wariness and increasing hostility as his internal policies revealed him to be no democrat. I discussed this with his advisers: how can you hope to persuade the west you are a good partner if you refuse to properly denounce the Soviet era, if you crack down on protests and stifle the media? They could not connect the two. And so the west naturally grew more and more suspicious, and Putin in response grew first disappointed, then angry and ultimately downright hostile. Since that first pro-western phase, I think it is possible to distinguish three further stages of \u201cPutinism\u201d.</p> \n<p>The second began in about 2003 and peaked in February 2007, when Putin travelled to Munich to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/11/usa.russia\" title=\"\">blistering attack</a> on the United States\u2019 pretensions to rule the world as \u201csole master\u201d. He was annoyed that instead of reciprocating his gestures (including his help in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan), the Americans had not only ignored his robust opposition to the war in Iraq, but were pressing ahead with plans for a missile shield that, in Putin\u2019s view, together with Nato\u2019s expansion, directly threatened Russia\u2019s security.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9a3ec7ab-4e7b-4c97-bb82-f63294f8ced4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9LgbNYi8Dn4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Phase three developed during the Barack Obama presidency, for four years of which Putin was nominally prime minister while remaining the key player in the Kremlin. He became furious with what he saw as the US\u2019s \u201csuperiority\u201d complex (one might also read that as a Russian inferiority complex), epitomised by Obama\u2019s remarks that Russia was a mere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/barack-obama-russia-regional-power-ukraine-weakness\" title=\"\">\u201cregional power\u201d</a>, and that Putin had \u201cthat kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom\u201d. Russian leaders (not just Putin) do not go in for personal insults like that. And they have a strong aversion to being lectured about how to behave.</p> \n<p>Putin\u2019s fury reached its peak at the time of the parliamentary elections in 2011, which were patently falsified and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/10/russia-protests-election-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">brought thousands into the streets</a> in protest. He blamed the Americans for supporting the demonstrators \u2013 not just morally but materially too \u2013 and as soon as he was re-elected president in 2012 he began to declare the supremacy of Russian society and morality over the \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cgenderless\u201d west. This led to a foreign policy based on the notion that if the west will not accept us as equal partners, then we will simply assume that role for ourselves. One can see this philosophy in action again and again.</p> \n<p>If the west can invade Iraq with impunity \u2013 so Putin reasons \u2013 then Russia can help out its mate in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad. If the west thinks it can just drag Ukraine, with its centuries-long ties to Russia and strategic importance, out of Moscow\u2019s orbit, then it can think again. If the west thinks it has the right to influence Russian affairs with its NGOs and funding, its constant propaganda and blatant support for the opposition, then how can it complain when we deploy a few internet bots to muck up your election processes? We are only doing what you have been doing to us for decades.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a9deaf8cffb30a8f4a7fa59da760f6a476fdc0e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a9deaf8cffb30a8f4a7fa59da760f6a476fdc0e/0_65_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin carrying a hunting rifle in the Russian republic of Tuva.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018\u2018The irony is that, in burnishing his image as a strongman, he betrays his vulnerability.\u2019 Vladimir Putin carrying a hunting rifle in the Russian republic of Tuva.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitry Astakhov/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This, I believe, is Putin\u2019s current modus operandi. He regards what he does as a mirror image of what the west does to Russia and around the world. The irony is that, in burnishing his image as a strongman, he betrays his vulnerability. His paranoia about permitting free elections and his thuggish recent crackdown on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/03/russian-police-detain-opposition-leader-lyubov-sobol\" title=\"\">pro-democracy protest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/03/russian-police-detain-opposition-leader-lyubov-sobol\" title=\"\">ers</a> are evidence of his weakness. The more he entrenches, the clearer it becomes that he is terrified of losing control \u2013 and of the retribution that may follow. He has now created a police state that brooks no dissent, buttressed by a media that glorifies his every word in true Soviet style.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/aug/09/vladimir-putin-20-years-in-power-in-pictures\">Vladimir Putin: 20 years in power - in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is little prospect of an improvement in relations so long as Putin remains in power. But in the longer term there is hope. The Russian two-headed eagle has always looked both west and into its own soul. The current situation is essentially one of those perennial lurches towards Russian exceptionalism or Slavophilism, and the pendulum will surely swing back. Most Russians \u2013 certainly in the intelligentsia and middle classes \u2013 remain western-oriented.</p> \n<p>Putin is still popular at home precisely because he has instinctively surfed the nation\u2019s changing moods \u2013 reflecting both their desire to be part of the world from which they were shut off for decades, and their craving for respect and security. When he eventually leaves the scene, the west might bear that in mind. For even if he lacks Putin\u2019s ruthlessness, his successor\u2019s priorities will be pretty much the same.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Angus Roxburgh is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/moscow-calling-608853.html\" title=\"\">Moscow Calling: Memoirs of a Foreign Correspondent</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Boris Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin prime minister on 9 August 1999, few Russians knew much about him. In early television appearances he came across as mousy, shy and awkward, a man unaccustomed to the limelight from which his previous career in the KGB had shielded him. But within weeks he revealed a character trait that would become the defining feature of his rule \u2013 ruthlessness. His first memorable phrase was his threat to wipe out terrorists \u201ceven if they\u2019re in the shithouse\u201d, and within weeks he had launched a terrifying war against separatists in Chechnya that would leave tens of thousands of civilians dead. Twenty years on, as Russia and the west teeter towards confrontation, it is hard to remember that Putin started out as an avowedly pro-western leader. George W Bush and Tony Blair rushed to glad-hand him, and Putin himself stood in the Bundestag proclaiming at length and in fluent German that Russia\u2019s destiny was in Europe. But western leaders were appalled by his brutality in Chechnya, and by the first signs of his antidemocratic tendencies, which included his muzzling of critical television stations. Putin\u2019s fatal flaw, it seemed to me, was his utter inability to see that there was a contradiction between being a ruthless autocrat at home, and the values of the western civilisation to which he (at least at that time) paid lip service. Some argue that he was never seriously pro-western, that the overtures masked ulterior motives and KGB-inspired schemes to dominate the world. But I think that is mistaken. When I worked as a consultant to the Kremlin in the earlier part of Putin\u2019s rule, I had many meetings with senior officials and have no doubt that they regarded themselves as \u201cwestern\u201d and even as democrats. The problem lay elsewhere \u2013 in Putin\u2019s inability to understand the west\u2019s wariness and increasing hostility as his internal policies revealed him to be no democrat. I discussed this with his advisers: how can you hope to persuade the west you are a good partner if you refuse to properly denounce the Soviet era, if you crack down on protests and stifle the media? They could not connect the two. And so the west naturally grew more and more suspicious, and Putin in response grew first disappointed, then angry and ultimately downright hostile. Since that first pro-western phase, I think it is possible to distinguish three further stages of \u201cPutinism\u201d. The second began in about 2003 and peaked in February 2007, when Putin travelled to Munich to deliver a blistering attack on the United States\u2019 pretensions to rule the world as \u201csole master\u201d. He was annoyed that instead of reciprocating his gestures (including his help in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan), the Americans had not only ignored his robust opposition to the war in Iraq, but were pressing ahead with plans for a missile shield that, in Putin\u2019s view, together with Nato\u2019s expansion, directly threatened Russia\u2019s security. Phase three developed during the Barack Obama presidency, for four years of which Putin was nominally prime minister while remaining the key player in the Kremlin. He became furious with what he saw as the US\u2019s \u201csuperiority\u201d complex (one might also read that as a Russian inferiority complex), epitomised by Obama\u2019s remarks that Russia was a mere \u201cregional power\u201d, and that Putin had \u201cthat kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom\u201d. Russian leaders (not just Putin) do not go in for personal insults like that. And they have a strong aversion to being lectured about how to behave. Putin\u2019s fury reached its peak at the time of the parliamentary elections in 2011, which were patently falsified and brought thousands into the streets in protest. He blamed the Americans for supporting the demonstrators \u2013 not just morally but materially too \u2013 and as soon as he was re-elected president in 2012 he began to declare the supremacy of Russian society and morality over the \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cgenderless\u201d west. This led to a foreign policy based on the notion that if the west will not accept us as equal partners, then we will simply assume that role for ourselves. One can see this philosophy in action again and again. If the west can invade Iraq with impunity \u2013 so Putin reasons \u2013 then Russia can help out its mate in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad. If the west thinks it can just drag Ukraine, with its centuries-long ties to Russia and strategic importance, out of Moscow\u2019s orbit, then it can think again. If the west thinks it has the right to influence Russian affairs with its NGOs and funding, its constant propaganda and blatant support for the opposition, then how can it complain when we deploy a few internet bots to muck up your election processes? We are only doing what you have been doing to us for decades. This, I believe, is Putin\u2019s current modus operandi. He regards what he does as a mirror image of what the west does to Russia and around the world. The irony is that, in burnishing his image as a strongman, he betrays his vulnerability. His paranoia about permitting free elections and his thuggish recent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters are evidence of his weakness. The more he entrenches, the clearer it becomes that he is terrified of losing control \u2013 and of the retribution that may follow. He has now created a police state that brooks no dissent, buttressed by a media that glorifies his every word in true Soviet style. There is little prospect of an improvement in relations so long as Putin remains in power. But in the longer term there is hope. The Russian two-headed eagle has always looked both west and into its own soul. The current situation is essentially one of those perennial lurches towards Russian exceptionalism or Slavophilism, and the pendulum will surely swing back. Most Russians \u2013 certainly in the intelligentsia and middle classes \u2013 remain western-oriented. Putin is still popular at home precisely because he has instinctively surfed the nation\u2019s changing moods \u2013 reflecting both their desire to be part of the world from which they were shut off for decades, and their craving for respect and security. When he eventually leaves the scene, the west might bear that in mind. For even if he lacks Putin\u2019s ruthlessness, his successor\u2019s priorities will be pretty much the same. \u2022 Angus Roxburgh is the author of Moscow Calling: Memoirs of a Foreign Correspondent",

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage has derided the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for their \u201cirrelevant\u201d social justice and environmental campaigns while abusing Prince Charles and describing the late Queen Mother as an \u201coverweight, chain-smoking gin drinker\u201d, in an incendiary speech to an Australian rightwing political conference. Farage\u2019s speech to Sydney\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference \u2013 from which media were barred \u2013 ranged across his views on Brexit, media bias and the United Nations, but he reserved his fiercest condemnation for members of the royal family, including princes Charles and Harry, and the Queen Mother. The Brexit party leader was laudatory about the Queen \u2013 \u201can amazing, awe-inspiring woman, we\u2019re bloody lucky to have her\u201d \u2013 but abused her son, grandson and mother. \u201cWhen it comes to her son, when it comes to Charlie Boy and climate change, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Her mother, Her Royal Highness the Queen\u2019s mother was a slightly overweight, chain-smoking gin drinker who lived to 101 years old. All I can say is Charlie Boy is now in his 70s \u2026 may the Queen live a very, very long time.\u201d Later, in response to a question about women choosing not to have children because of the climate crisis, he commented on Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to have only two children. \u201cWell, if I want the Queen to live a long time to stop Charlie Boy becoming king, I want Charlie Boy to live even longer and William to live forever to stop Harry becoming king,\u201d he said. \u201cTerrifying! Here was Harry, here he was this young, brave, boisterous, all male, getting into trouble, turning up at stag parties inappropriately dressed, drinking too much and causing all sorts of mayhem. And then, a brave British officer who did his bit in Afghanistan. He was the most popular royal of a younger generation that we\u2019ve seen for 100 years. \u201cAnd then he met Meghan Markle, and it\u2019s fallen off a cliff. We\u2019ve been told in the last week that Meghan and Harry will only have two children \u2026 and we\u2019re all completely ignoring, the real problem the Earth faces, and that is the fact the population of the globe is exploding but no one dares talk about it, no one dares deal with it, and whether Prince Harry has two kids is irrelevant given there are now 2.6 billion Chinese and Indians on this Earth.\u201d Farage\u2019s reference to \u201cdressing up inappropriately\u201d is an allusion to photographs of Harry at a 2005 party dressed in a Nazi uniform. Harry is now sixth in line of succession to the British throne, behind all of Prince William\u2019s children, and will not automatically follow his brother to the throne. The Guardian has heard a recording of part of Farage\u2019s speech in which the Brexit party leader is laudatory about the Queen while abusing her relatives. While not on the recording, other media outlets have reported that Farage described Harry as \u201cthe prince of wokeness\u201d. Guardian Australia has spoken to sources who said they had heard the comment, but others who said they weren\u2019t sure or that they had not heard it. Farage has previously canvassed his disdain for some members of the royal family. In 2008 he was the sole MEP who refused to applaud a speech on the climate crisis by Prince Charles, later saying the prince\u2019s advisers were \u201cnaive and foolish at best\u201d. After Charles argued for greater legislative powers for the EU he wrote: \u201cI seldom agree with Prince Charles \u2026 I do not think it is appropriate for the heir to a constitutional monarchy to want to take power away from his mother\u2019s government.\u201d Farage was introduced to a partisan Sydney crowd of about 500 on Saturday as \u201cquite possibly\u201d the next British prime minister \u2013 despite not being a member of the UK parliament, and having failed seven times to be elected as an MP. He told his Australian audience \u201cgreenies have taken over this country\u201d, and condemned the deposed prime minister Malcolm Turnbull as a \u201csnake\u201d. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull \u2026 pretended to be a conservative but actually turned out to be a snake,\u201d he said, comparing him to David Cameron. \u201cDavid Cameron was someone who was not conservative at all, but a part of the trendy, metro, liberal elite masquerading as a conservative.\u201d Farage said of Turnbull\u2019s successor, Scott Morrison, who unexpectedly won a general election in May: \u201cYou\u2019ve now got someone conservative, mainstream media [and] those in the middle of Melbourne and Sydney may not like him \u2026 but out where real people live, they voted for him.\u201d",

Declaring she would not be \u201cdefeatist\u201d about the job prospects of Australia\u2019s hardcore unemployed, Anne Ruston said she was confident help could be provided to get people into work. \u201cI think we need to deal with this on a case-by-case basis because I genuinely believe that everybody who is on Newstart with the right amount of assistance, we can help them into a job,\u201d she told ABC radio. \u201cI believe \u2026 we need to work with everybody in Australia who doesn\u2019t have a job who wants to get a job. We need to work through their unique circumstances and to work out how we can break down the barriers that are preventing them from getting a job.\u201d She pointed to an individual placement support program that had helped 500 young people who had been suffering from significant mental health conditions to get work as an example of how barriers to employment could be overcome. The comments come after Guardian Australia revealed the number of people claiming Newstart had increased in about 10% of areas across the country despite a national improvement, with remote Indigenous communities among the hardest hit. Figures released by the Coalition on Sunday showed 42,000 fewer people were receiving Newstart and Youth Allowance in 2018-19 compared with the year before, equivalent to a drop of 5%, with the government using the figures to push back against calls to lift the benefit. But the data, obtained by Guardian Australia, shows that the results are patchy across the country. In about 10% of geographic areas the number of people claiming the benefit has increased, with remote unemployment hotspots among those getting worse in the past year. In the Northern Territory, Palmerston recorded a more than 20% increase in the number of people claiming Newstart or Youth Allowance, jumping from 1,119 to 1,366 individuals \u2013 an increase of 247. In the outback NT communities of Katherine and Barkly there was a more than 16% spike in the number of people on benefits, while the Darwin suburbs, Litchfield and East Arnhem Land all recorded an increase of more than 3%. In outback South Australia, which includes the remote Indigenous communities of the A\u1e49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, more than 2,000 people are claiming Newstart or Youth Allowance, with the number up about 5% year on year. Other communities showing a spike included Jimboomba and Beaudesert, south of Brisbane, up 5.2% and 4.5% respectively. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The strongest performing areas where the number of welfare recipients was significantly down included East Canberra (-48%), and Brunswick, Manningham, Stonnington and Darebin \u2013 all in suburban Melbourne \u2013 which all recorded a drop of more than 16%. In Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, where the government is trialling the cashless debit card that quarantines welfare payments, the figure had dropped by about 10%. Ruston said that some of the increases, including those in the outback could be as a result of isolated and locally focused factors, \u201cwhether it be cyclical, seasonal or structural regions for unemployment in these areas.\u201d The social services minister, Anne Ruston, said the figures, provided to the News Corp Sunday papers, showed the government\u2019s job-creating policies were working. \u201cIf you are unemployed and you\u2019re on Newstart, we will do everything that we possibly can to get you off Newstart and into a job,\u201d Ruston said. \u201cWith the introduction of the cashless debit card for young people who are on welfare, we have seen a 10% decrease in unemployment of youth up there,\u201d she said. Labor\u2019s shadow minister for families and social services, Linda Burney, pointed to government data which shows there are 19 applicants on average for every job. \u201cThe Liberals and Nationals are out of touch with how hard it is to get a decent job \u2013 and the economy simply isn\u2019t delivering for working Australians,\u201d she said. The release of the figures comes as the government pushes back against growing calls for the Newstart payment of about $275 a week to be lifted, and after a Guardian Essential poll found overwhelming support among voters for a boost. Welfare and business groups, with backing from the Greens and Labor, have been calling for the rate of Newstart to be lifted, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has ruled it out, saying his focus is on finding jobs for the unemployed.",

Though the coal industry has significantly declined, its historically exploitative practices still persist as coal corporations file bankruptcies that leave workers unpaid, while coal communities are left behind. Several mine sites have even been abandoned with no implemented clean-up. Congress has yet to pass several proposed bills to fund these benefits and clean up projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a racket. Miners are being robbed every day,\u201d said Bethel Brock, who was a coalminer for 32 years in Wise, Virginia. Between 1968 to 2014, an estimated 76,000 coalminers died of black lung disease. He fought coal companies for 14 years to secure his own black lung benefits after he was diagnosed. \u201cThe coal operators don\u2019t care, they just want to take you like a piece of worn out mining equipment and set you out in a field somewhere, that\u2019s their philosophy.\u201d Brock continues fighting for other miners to receive their benefits in the face of attorneys and coal company doctors who drag out appeals against paying out benefits and intimidate current miners from filing claims. \u201cWe live in a country that tolerates stuff like that,\u201d he said.",

But it was surprisingly close. In 2014, Olson\u2019s margin of victory was 35 percentage points. In 2016 his lead was cut to 19 points. Last year it was sliced to only five points.</p> <p>The district is now widely viewed as one of the most competitive in the country and Olson will not be on the ballot in 2020. He is one of four Texas Republican representatives in the space of less than two weeks who recently announced their retirements, including Will Hurd, the only black Republican in the House.</p> <p>That three of them are in competitive districts adds fuel to Democratic hopes that Texas and its 38 electoral college votes, second only to California, will become a battleground state in local, state and presidential elections after decades as a Republican fortress.</p> <p>Optimistic Democrats who backed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s bid to unseat senator Ted Cruz last year might argue that it already is up for grabs.

Without his presence in the White House we wouldn\u2019t be having much in the way of discussions these days about turning Texas purple,\u201d said Mark Jones, a political scientist at Rice University. Like former Texas congressman and current presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke, Kulkarni\u2019s political messaging centers on inclusivity, respect for differences and engaging young people. It contrasts starkly with the racial divisiveness promoted by Donald Trump and senior Texas Republicans long before the recent massacre at an El Paso Walmart, allegedly by a gunman who chose his targets because he believes the state is under \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d. \u201cTo me it\u2019s hate speech. That\u2019s what it is when you talk about entire races, entire religions that way, you\u2019ve got to call it out for what it is,\u201d Kulkarni said. \u201cWhen it incites people to violence you have to expect those kinds of results. In terms of what we can do on our side to counteract that, you talk about what America really is.\u201d A former diplomat, Kulkarni, 40, is the son of an Indian novelist and academic who immigrated to America in 1969 and a white mother whose family came to the US in the 1600s. Through her he is descended from Sam Houston, who in 1836 became the first president of the Republic of Texas. Kulkarni is trying again in 2020 after he lost the 22nd district election last November to the Republican incumbent, Pete Olson, who derided him as an \u201cIndo-American who is a carpetbagger\u201d at a campaign event. But it was surprisingly close. In 2014, Olson\u2019s margin of victory was 35 percentage points. In 2016 his lead was cut to 19 points. Last year it was sliced to only five points. The district is now widely viewed as one of the most competitive in the country and Olson will not be on the ballot in 2020. He is one of four Texas Republican representatives in the space of less than two weeks who recently announced their retirements, including Will Hurd, the only black Republican in the House. That three of them are in competitive districts adds fuel to Democratic hopes that Texas and its 38 electoral college votes, second only to California, will become a battleground state in local, state and presidential elections after decades as a Republican fortress. Optimistic Democrats who backed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s bid to unseat senator Ted Cruz last year might argue that it already is up for grabs. Cruz clung on to his Senate job by just 2.6 percentage points in a contest that brought O\u2019Rourke so much national attention that he decided to run for president. In a district where a hundred languages are spoken, Kulkarni plans to redouble his campaign\u2019s community outreach in 2020 after finding success reaching Asian American voters last year with a granular approach. \u201cPeople used to say that that would be a waste of time, a low ROI, because most people speak English or the people who don\u2019t aren\u2019t going to vote anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve gotten them to come out in huge numbers. We can do the same thing with the Latino community which is one-fourth of this district but was the lowest turnout group among the four major ethnic groups. We don\u2019t treat Latinos as a monolith, we go out into individual communities, whether you\u2019re talking about a Honduran or Colombian or Venezuelan or Dominican immigrant community.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just about one candidate, it\u2019s about all of these people saying \u2018this does not represent me\u2019,\u201d Kulkarni said. \u201cThat\u2019s why all these Republicans are retiring, because they don\u2019t represent their communities.\u201d",

Tanya Day, 55, died in hospital on 22 December 2017. She had been in a coma for 17 days, after falling and hitting her head at Castlemaine police station. The Yorta Yorta woman had been arrested for public drunkenness after falling asleep on a V/Line train from Echuca, and had been taken into custody to \u201csober up\u201d. Coroner Caitlin English listed the case for mention on Monday, two weeks before a three-week inquest is scheduled to begin, because she had seen emails from the coronial investigator in the case \u2013 Detective Senior Constable Scott Riley \u2013 which she said gave an appearance of a lack of independence. \u201cThe concern that this raised to me was with respect to conflict of interest and the appearance that he remain independent,\u201d English said. In July, Riley emailed the Victoria police civil litigation branch about a request made by the court for the release of a section of the Victoria police manual concerning the investigation of deaths in custody, and asked the lawyers for their \u201cthoughts\u201d. That email was then forwarded to the external law firm that acts for police, with the same request.

Lawyers for Victoria police said there had been \u201cno interference\u201d in the case, and \u201cthere would not be, there has not been, there will not be\u201d. English said she would not remove Riley as the coronial investigator, but would allow him to be cross-examined on this issue at the inquest, and would consider making recommendations around the lack of legislative protection for the independence of coronial investigators. She said it was a concern that police policy was to run the release of police documents past their internal lawyers. English has already said that she intends to recommend the repeal of the laws. Day\u2019s family said they were frustrated and disappointed that Riley was not removed as the investigator. \u201cWe are just voicing the concerns of many other families that have been through this, that police shouldn\u2019t be investigating police, and hopefully in the future some recommendations can be made that address this,\u201d Day\u2019s eldest daughter, Belinda Stevens, said outside court.

She said concerns about the ability of police to effectively investigate police in death-in-custody cases had been raised on state, national and international levels. \u201cTanya Day died in police custody: police conduct is at the heart of this case,\u201d she said. Day\u2019s family has argued that the public drunkenness laws, which exist only in Victoria and Queensland, should be abolished. The inquest, due to begin on 26 August, is the first in Australia to consider whether systemic racism was a factor in a person\u2019s death in custody.",

      "bodyText": "More than 10,000 firearms have been bought by New Zealand\u2019s government in less than a month as part of its gun buyback scheme following the Christchurch mosque shootings in March. Following the killing of 51 people in two inner-city Christchurch mosques by an Australian white supremacist, prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government rushed through legislation to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons and set aside NZ$150m to buy firearms that were now illegal. A bill outlawing most automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and components that modify existing weapons, was passed by a vote of 119 to 1 in April. \u201cI could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could be obtained legally in this country,\u201d Ardern said at the time. \u201cI struggle to recall any single gunshot wounds.

They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that\u2019s before you consider the psychological impact. We are here for them.\u201d The shooter bought the weapons for the killings legally in New Zealand, despite experts initially suspecting they had been acquired on the blackmarket. The governments gun-buyback scheme was launched in mid July. Since then, 10,242 firearms have been handed into police, with an additional 1,269 firearms handed in under amnesty. The amnesty mean no questions will be asked by police about when or how owners acquired the now-banned weapons, even if they don\u2019t have a current firearms licence or paperwork for the weapons. Ninety gun collection events have been held around the country, New Zealand police said, attended by more than 7,000 firearms owners. In a statement New Zealand police praised gun owners\u2019 engagement with the process, and said they were \u201creally happy\u201d with the public response. In the days and weeks following the worst massacre in New Zealand\u2019s modern history some firearms owners voluntarily handed in their weapons, citing disgust at the carnage they had caused on 15 March. However, others began stockpiling weapons and ammunition that would soon be banned, and numerous gun clubs and hunting associations have criticised the buyback scheme, saying the compensation offered was paltry and the majority of law-abiding gun owners should not be penalised for the actions of one individual. Unlike the US where the right to self-protection if often quoted, the majority of New Zealand gun owners say they own weapons for sport, recreation and hunting. The total number of firearms in New Zealand is estimated to be between 1.2m and 1.5m, and gun owners of now-prohibited weapons have until 20 December to hand in their weapons. Possession of a banned weapon or part can carry a prison term of two to five years.",

      "bodyText": "The Kurdish Iranian writer Behrouz Boochani has continued his sweep of the Australian literary prize landscape, winning the $25,000 National Biography award on Monday \u2013 yet another award the refugee was unable to accept in person, as he enters his sixth year of detention on Manus Island. Boochani\u2019s autobiography No Friend but the Mountains tells of his journey from Indonesia to Australia by boat, and his subsequent imprisonment on Manus Island by the Australian government, which continues to refuse him entry. The journalist and activist who fled Iran in 2013 under fear of persecution composed the book one text message at the time from Manus. It was translated from Persian by his friend Omid Tofighian. No Friend but the Mountains has already won $125,000 at the Victorian premier\u2019s literary awards, the country\u2019s richest literary prize; $10,000 at the New South Wales premier\u2019s literary awards; and non-fiction book of the year at the Australian Book Industry awards. At the National Biography award, which was presented on Monday morning at the State Library of NSW, the judges\u2019 praised Boochani\u2019s book as \u201cprofoundly important, an astonishing act of witness and testament to the lifesaving power of writing as resistance\u201d. Boochani appeared at the awards ceremony via WhatsApp. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about literature, I would [just] like to say that I think the literature community as a part of civil society of Australia are part of our resistance in front of this system, and I think it is very valuable, and I do appreciate everyone for recognising my work,\u201d he said. He thanked the prize organisers, Tofighian and his first translator, Moones Mansoubi, as well as his other supporters. \u201cI think history will judge this generation and will judge all of us in this hard and dark period of Australian history,\u201d he said. In February, after winning the Victorian premier\u2019s literary prize, Boochani said he had created an image of himself as \u201ca novelist in a remote prison\u201d as a coping mechanism in the face of the brutality of Manus. \u201cThis image always helped me uphold my dignity and keep my identity as a human being,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I created this image in opposition to the image created by the system.\u201d The judges, Margy Burn, Dr Georgina Arnott and Prof Iain McCalman, said Boochani\u2019s writing was \u201cpoetic and epic, steeped in the tradition of Persian culture and belief systems\u201d and \u201ccompelling storytelling\u201d. \u201cCollaboration [with Tofighian] has made this book, which demonstrates how innovative, experimental and creative the work of translation can be,\u201d they said. Sofija Stefanovic was also awarded the $5,000 Michael Crouch award for a debut work for her memoir Miss Ex-Yugoslavia, which the judges described as \u201cfinely observed and ambitious\u201d. Four authors who were also shortlisted for the award will each receive $2,000. They were Do Oysters Get Bored? A Curious Life by Rozanna Lilley, One Hundred Years of Dirt by Rick Morton, The Trauma Cleaner by Sarah Krasnostein and The Wasp and the Orchid: The Remarkable Life of Australian Naturalist Edith Coleman by Danielle Clode.",
