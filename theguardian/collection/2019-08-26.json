Organisations knew they were performing if they could demonstrate they had met a quota.

A <a href=\"https://www.dca.org.au/research/project/benchmarking-diversity-and-inclusion-practices-australia\" rel=\"nofollow\">2018 study by Diversity Council Australia</a> showed that only 22% of businesses actively measured the impact of diversity and inclusion initiatives, but according to the council\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dca.org.au/research/project/inclusion-index\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inclusion@Work Index</a>, inclusive teams were 10 times more productive than their non-inclusive counterparts. Workers in such teams were less likely to be harassed at work, more likely to have higher job satisfaction, and nine times more likely to innovate. In short: a diverse workplace is more sustainable and more likely to succeed.</p> <p>This is an idea supported by the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), which the UN describes as a \u201cblueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all\u201d. The SDGs suggest that workplace diversity can help businesses meet the goals of reduced inequalities, gender equality and decent work and economic growth, all of which drive better conditions and fairness for all back into the community.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise, then, that companies aspiring to the UN\u2019s goals are increasingly people-led. At Australia Post, the aim is to foster a supportive environment for everyone who works inside - and outside - the office walls. Sharon Carroll, Australia Post\u2019s diversity and inclusion partner, says the first big shift in workplace diversity was a change in language: from diversifying to <em>including</em>.</p> <p>\u201cDiversity I think of as measuring,\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas there\u2019s been so much research done in recent years that says you\u2019re not really tapping into the value of that diversity unless those people feel included.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9698de7632bcffd90bb056728939bd955e70e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9698de7632bcffd90bb056728939bd955e70e92/0_143_2120_1272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casual businesswoman standing by table in meeting room, colleagues listening, woman using laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casual businesswoman standing by table in meeting room, colleagues listening, woman using laptop</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Greig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Organisations now talk about inclusion rather than diversity, prioritising the people in the business and amplifying their voices. Companies that do this well are working with multiple groups to better understand how to support and nurture a truly inclusive environment.</p> <p>Taking this approach is good for business. The <a href=\"https://www.dca.org.au/research/project/inclusion-index\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inclusion@Work Index</a> shows that organisations with gender diversity are 21% more likely to outperform their industry peers. Those with cultural and ethnic diversity are 33% more likely to outperform their peers.</p> <p>Australia Post has made a tangible, purposeful shift towards inclusivity. \u201cWhere we\u2019ve changed our approach is that rather than acting in isolation, we understand what the business strategy is and how inclusivity can help us meet it,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a diverse group of people, but it\u2019s important to make sure they feel their different perspectives count - that they matter.\u201d</p> <p>Carroll uses accessibility as an example. She has helped create an internal employee reference group: Accessibility Matters. It invites people with disability, and their carers and allies, to contribute to a more positive experience for those affected by accessibility issues. This includes, Carroll says, leaders and managers who want to create positive spaces for staff.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People want to come to work and feel that they\u2019re being treated fairly, that they have an opportunity to contribute, that we all have a purpose.</p> <footer> <cite>Sharon Carroll</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Australia Post has made this commitment formal and public, in the form of an action plan that has been submitted to and published by the Australian Human Rights Commission.

Carroll says it\u2019s not only about direct relationships, but also the impact on communities around those businesses. One such focus area is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enterprise.</p> <p>\u201cWe partnered with Indigenous businesses in our supply chain and won four major awards at the 2019 <a href=\"https://supplynationconnect.com.au/2019-supplier-diversity-awards/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supply Nation Awards</a>,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 2018 we released <a href=\"https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/social-procurement-white-paper-lr-remediation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a whitepaper around unlocking the value of social procurement and supplier diversity</a> [with] the idea of sharing that knowledge and building that knowledge externally, so it\u2019s not just about us tapping into something great, but sharing our approach with others.\u201d</p> <p>Working with Indigenous businesses, including <a href=\"https://www.redridge.org.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Ridge</a> in Queensland and the <a href=\"https://tjanpi.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tjanpi Desert Weavers</a> in Central Australia, links directly to the Sustainable Development Goals as well: decent work, economic growth and reduced inequality.</p> <p>Workplace diversity and inclusion is an ever-evolving area. While businesses previously might have partnered with a charity for goodwill and brand presence, now they look for ways to make lasting change that puts people first.</p> <p>The message is clear, Carroll says. \u201cIf you want to be competitive, if you want to stay in business, you really have to be very clear about what you\u2019re doing. Customers and consumers these days are smart, and they want to partner with businesses that stand for something and are about more than just making money.\u201d</p> <p>The upside for those Australian businesses taking an inclusive approach is they are already enjoying the increased success that comes with it.<br><br><em><strong>Australia Post has set their sights on 2030 with a new corporate responsibility plan that charts commitments and aspirations to help achieve the <a href=\"https://auspost.com.au/about-us/corporate-responsibility\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sustainable Development Goals</a></strong></em></p>",

One such focus area is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enterprise. \u201cWe partnered with Indigenous businesses in our supply chain and won four major awards at the 2019 Supply Nation Awards,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 2018 we released a whitepaper around unlocking the value of social procurement and supplier diversity [with] the idea of sharing that knowledge and building that knowledge externally, so it\u2019s not just about us tapping into something great, but sharing our approach with others.\u201d Working with Indigenous businesses, including Red Ridge in Queensland and the Tjanpi Desert Weavers in Central Australia, links directly to the Sustainable Development Goals as well: decent work, economic growth and reduced inequality. Workplace diversity and inclusion is an ever-evolving area. While businesses previously might have partnered with a charity for goodwill and brand presence, now they look for ways to make lasting change that puts people first. The message is clear, Carroll says. \u201cIf you want to be competitive, if you want to stay in business, you really have to be very clear about what you\u2019re doing. Customers and consumers these days are smart, and they want to partner with businesses that stand for something and are about more than just making money.\u201d The upside for those Australian businesses taking an inclusive approach is they are already enjoying the increased success that comes with it. Australia Post has set their sights on 2030 with a new corporate responsibility plan that charts commitments and aspirations to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals",

After successfully winning a similar pension case on behalf of judges, the London law firm Leigh Day is preparing employment tribunal cases for public sector workers.

The latest wave of legal action follows the supreme court\u2019s refusal earlier this summer to hear an appeal by the government against a landmark ruling that found alterations to the terms of judges\u2019 and firefighters\u2019 pensions were discriminatory.

Ben Stokes has also been seen in their company trackside. After Headingley\u2019s Ashes Test spectacular, there would be a huge buzz at any race meeting attended by Stokes &amp; co.

Johnno Spence, a Turf PR specialist and a friend of the cricketing syndicate, said on Monday the filly recently had a summer break. \u201cShe\u2019s been back in training at Richard\u2019s for about 10 days and the plan would be for her to be back on a racecourse whenever she\u2019s ready. They bought her just over two years ago and have had tremendous fun. They go racing as often as they can.\u201d</p> \n<p>The trio invariably try to attend Royal Ascot. And at the Cheltenham Festival in March they were in the company of Love Island\u2019s Chris Hughes, an ambassador for Coral.</p> \n<p>Win and place prize money of \u00a3118,000 has so far been earned by the four-year-old, who has run 23 times. She has won three races \u2013 at Windsor, Newmarket and Brighton. The Newmarket victory, in a valuable auction stakes, earned her syndicate more than \u00a381,000.</p> \n<p>Stokes fever has gripped the country. Paul Nicholls has quickly reserved the horse name Onethreefivenotout in honour of Stokes\u2019s big innings. \u201cI was watching the match at home, like most people across the country, and I just thought it would be great to get in quickly and reserve the name,\u201d Nicholls told PA. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually committed the name to a particular horse yet. We\u2019ll sit on the fence for the time being.\u201d</p> \n<p>Officials at Carlisle racecourse do not want to be left out either.

      "bodyText": "Ashes fever is spreading to racing and one focus of excitement is where a filly named Elysium Dream will run next \u2013 because she could well bring along to the track three of her owners plus teammates. Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson and Eoin Morgan are the stalwarts of The Racing Cricketers &amp; Partner, the syndicate whose colours she runs in. The trio are regular racegoers and are often accompanied by Jonny Bairstow. Ben Stokes has also been seen in their company trackside. After Headingley\u2019s Ashes Test spectacular, there would be a huge buzz at any race meeting attended by Stokes &amp; co. That could be soon. Elysium Dream recently arrived back in training at Richard Hannon\u2019s Marlborough stables. Johnno Spence, a Turf PR specialist and a friend of the cricketing syndicate, said on Monday the filly recently had a summer break. \u201cShe\u2019s been back in training at Richard\u2019s for about 10 days and the plan would be for her to be back on a racecourse whenever she\u2019s ready. They bought her just over two years ago and have had tremendous fun. They go racing as often as they can.\u201d The trio invariably try to attend Royal Ascot. And at the Cheltenham Festival in March they were in the company of Love Island\u2019s Chris Hughes, an ambassador for Coral. Win and place prize money of \u00a3118,000 has so far been earned by the four-year-old, who has run 23 times. She has won three races \u2013 at Windsor, Newmarket and Brighton. The Newmarket victory, in a valuable auction stakes, earned her syndicate more than \u00a381,000. Stokes fever has gripped the country. Paul Nicholls has quickly reserved the horse name Onethreefivenotout in honour of Stokes\u2019s big innings. \u201cI was watching the match at home, like most people across the country, and I just thought it would be great to get in quickly and reserve the name,\u201d Nicholls told PA. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually committed the name to a particular horse yet. We\u2019ll sit on the fence for the time being.\u201d Officials at Carlisle racecourse do not want to be left out either. Molly Dingwall, Carlisle\u2019s general manager, said: \u201cI\u2019m not a big cricket fan, to be honest, but I got massively into it over the weekend.

The environmental disaster has taken on international dimensions and overshadowed the G7 meeting in Biarritz. Federal prosecutors in the Amazon state of Par\u00e1 have now launched an investigation after revealing that they warned Brazil\u2019s environment agency Ibama that a \u201cfire day\u201d demonstration was being planned around the town of Novo Progresso. The prosecutors noted that the local Folha do Progresso news site had reported on plans for the fire day 5 August. \u201cWe need to show the president that we want to work\u201d one local farmer told the website, adding that the only way to clear land for pasture was by felling trees and burning them.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is preparing to send half a dozen staunch Conservative loyalists to the House of Lords, in an attempt to bolster the party\u2019s position in the upper chamber. The new crop of peers are unlikely to be confirmed until after the 31 October Brexit deadline \u2013 but the appointments will be read as a signal Johnson is determined to stamp his mark on parliament. Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list is expected to be announced in the coming days, with rewards for several of the key lieutenants who supported her through her premiership, including her chief of staff, the former MP Gavin Barwell. Johnson is believed to have already drawn up a list of up to six names to be submitted to the House of Lords appointments commission, which has to approve new members. The Conservatives have 238 peers in the House of Lords \u2013 but the government can easily be defeated if the 178 Labour and 95 Liberal Democrats work together. The previous government faced a string of heavy losses over Brexit, which paved the way for MPs to exact concessions, including on a meaningful vote. In several cases, Tory peers including the former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten (Lord Patten of Barnes), sided with the opposition parties. Recently, peers passed a motion tabled by Labour\u2019s leader in the House of Lords, Angela Smith, calling on the government to establish a cross-party select committee to examine the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The former prime minister, Gordon Brown, has suggested that MPs should take up the idea when they return to Westminster next week, and set aside a day of parliamentary time to debate the consequences of leaving without a deal. Johnson has been accused of plotting to override parliament since he arrived at No 10, with his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, telling colleagues they must be ready to use any means necessary to ensure Brexit happens by the end of October. Both the cabinet and Johnson\u2019s Downing Street team have been packed with veterans of the successful Vote Leave campaign, stoking speculation that he expects to be fighting a general election in the coming months. Johnson\u2019s ministers had to agree they were willing to countenance a no-deal Brexit if necessary, after May faced a string of rebellions, including from within her own cabinet. In a foreword to a new edition of the ministerial code published last week, Johnson insisted there must be \u201cno misuse of process or procedure by any individual minister that would seek to stall the collective decisions necessary to deliver Brexit and secure the wider changes needed across our United Kingdom\u201d. During Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign, there was speculation that he could send George Osborne to the Lords, after the former remainer gave the support of the newspaper he edits, the Evening Standard, to the prime minister\u2019s leadership campaign. Johnson has backed Osborne\u2019s campaign to be the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund \u2013 though it is highly unlikely to succeed, as the EU has already chosen its own candidate.",

      "body": "<p>Phew. I thought the opening episode set a cracking pace, but everything was ratcheted up a notch further tonight as a dangerous new player entered the mix, trailing bloody retribution and clouds of brimstone in his wake (alas poor Bonnie Gold, that was no way for a brave \u201cfighter boy\u201d to die).</p> \n<p>Nor was the brutal Jimmy McCavern\u2019s arrival the only problem facing the Shelby family, with hints of betrayal everywhere and pressures mounting both in parliament and Birmingham. No wonder an increasingly paranoid Tommy is beginning to resemble a 1920s version of Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III. A winter of discontent is almost certainly coming. If the king falls, who and how many will he take with him?</p> \n<h2><strong>Our </strong><strong>heroes</strong></h2> \n<p>As the old quote has it: \u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not after you.\u201d Certainly Tommy, swigging morphine in his big house in the country, is not exactly at his most stable but it\u2019s also true that he has good reason to feel besieged.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78fcadd8edf2df7ab7be84fa0dd326aeb16a6601\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78fcadd8edf2df7ab7be84fa0dd326aeb16a6601/0_181_4283_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If the king falls, who and how many will he take with him?

At home, the Billy Boys, led by the fearsome McCavern (Brian Gleeson), have designs on the racetrack business. Worst of all, there\u2019s clearly more than one traitor in the family, given that Aberama Gold\u2019s campsite location, which Michael couldn\u2019t have known, was betrayed. (It is one of the few absolute truths on this show that Johnny Dogs is no traitor).</p> \n<p>So what of Michael? Long-time readers of this blog will know that I\u2019ve never been convinced by the Shelby princeling. He\u2019s always carried the whiff of unbridled ambition around his shoulders and that\u2019s only got stronger since the move to New York. Is he being set up by the IRA or has he had contact with the Billy Boys?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fae5e38b0b17d31e9e3dc2c49633d061afa7b740\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fae5e38b0b17d31e9e3dc2c49633d061afa7b740/0_95_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gray (Finn Cole) and Gina Gray (Anya Taylor-Joy).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A lot sharper than she\u2019s letting on.\u2019 Michael Gray (Finn Cole) and Gina Gray (Anya Taylor-Joy).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s a measure of the ambivalence of Finn Cole\u2019s performance that I\u2019m genuinely unsure. He could have his eyes on the main prize but equally he could be exactly as he seems \u2013 a hot-headed fool of a boy who\u2019s out of his depth.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m more interested in new wife Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) who is clearly a lot sharper than she\u2019s letting on. I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if she turns out to be very dangerous indeed. (I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she ends up training her sights on Tommy.)</p> \n<p>Finally, what about Lizzie? It was interesting to learn that the house and the legitimate business is in the second Mrs Shelby\u2019s name and nice to be reminded that, in the right mood, she takes few prisoners. I\u2019ve always felt that the Shelby clan, and the men in particular, have a tendency to underestimate Lizzie, and tonight\u2019s episode underlined that. In fact, I rather think that Tommy\u2019s great tragedy might be that she\u2019s actually a good match for him, but he\u2019s only going to realise it when it\u2019s far, far too late.</p> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>bad </strong><strong>guys</strong></h2> \n<p>This is clearly going to be a series in which the Shelbys are under siege and the introduction of McCavern added a whole new dimension to the battle in hand.</p> \n<p>Fans of Irish crime thriller Love/Hate will know that Gleeson is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnkZ9CsEpV4\">quite brilliant at being unhinged</a> and the brief moments we saw of chief Billy Boy Jimmy suggested that he\u2019s going to have a fine old time bringing vengeance to Small Heath. That said I have my doubts about his understanding of game theory given that the brutal death of Bonnie Gold is only going to send Aberama on the sort of revenge mission that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/30/bloody-sam-peckinpah-wasted-insane-wild-bunch\">a Sam Peckinpah movie</a>.</p> \n<p>If Jimmy kills first and deals with the consequences later, Mosley is an altogether more slippery beast. I enjoyed the conversation between him, Tommy and Ada, not least because Sam Claflin is clearly having so much fun with the role. We also learned that Mosley has made some sort of contact with whom I would presume are the UVF, given the later suggestion that the Billy Boys provide security at his rallies. Although, it was kept just ambiguous enough to suggest that the MP might be trying to play both sides. That said, I suspect that the \u201cIrish question\u201d is just so much obfuscation on Mosley\u2019s part \u2013 his real interest lies in both Tommy\u2019s populism and his brutality, which he hopes to harness to his own ends.</p> \n<h2><strong>Notes from the </strong><strong>boardroom</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd8a9e86ddb1c18ba63c2d9624b45215ce924ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd8a9e86ddb1c18ba63c2d9624b45215ce924ea/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alas poor Arthur Shelby (Paul Anderson).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alas poor Arthur Shelby (Paul Anderson).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019/Ben Blackall</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>From the bleak, western-style opening to the final scene paying homage to the great gangster films of the past, this episode was beautifully directed.

      "bodyText": "Phew. I thought the opening episode set a cracking pace, but everything was ratcheted up a notch further tonight as a dangerous new player entered the mix, trailing bloody retribution and clouds of brimstone in his wake (alas poor Bonnie Gold, that was no way for a brave \u201cfighter boy\u201d to die). Nor was the brutal Jimmy McCavern\u2019s arrival the only problem facing the Shelby family, with hints of betrayal everywhere and pressures mounting both in parliament and Birmingham. No wonder an increasingly paranoid Tommy is beginning to resemble a 1920s version of Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III. A winter of discontent is almost certainly coming. If the king falls, who and how many will he take with him? Our heroes As the old quote has it: \u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not after you.\u201d Certainly Tommy, swigging morphine in his big house in the country, is not exactly at his most stable but it\u2019s also true that he has good reason to feel besieged. At work, the saturnine Oswald Mosley clearly hopes to use him for his own gain. At home, the Billy Boys, led by the fearsome McCavern (Brian Gleeson), have designs on the racetrack business. Worst of all, there\u2019s clearly more than one traitor in the family, given that Aberama Gold\u2019s campsite location, which Michael couldn\u2019t have known, was betrayed. (It is one of the few absolute truths on this show that Johnny Dogs is no traitor). So what of Michael? Long-time readers of this blog will know that I\u2019ve never been convinced by the Shelby princeling. He\u2019s always carried the whiff of unbridled ambition around his shoulders and that\u2019s only got stronger since the move to New York. Is he being set up by the IRA or has he had contact with the Billy Boys? It\u2019s a measure of the ambivalence of Finn Cole\u2019s performance that I\u2019m genuinely unsure. He could have his eyes on the main prize but equally he could be exactly as he seems \u2013 a hot-headed fool of a boy who\u2019s out of his depth. I\u2019m more interested in new wife Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) who is clearly a lot sharper than she\u2019s letting on. I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if she turns out to be very dangerous indeed. (I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she ends up training her sights on Tommy.) Finally, what about Lizzie? It was interesting to learn that the house and the legitimate business is in the second Mrs Shelby\u2019s name and nice to be reminded that, in the right mood, she takes few prisoners. I\u2019ve always felt that the Shelby clan, and the men in particular, have a tendency to underestimate Lizzie, and tonight\u2019s episode underlined that. In fact, I rather think that Tommy\u2019s great tragedy might be that she\u2019s actually a good match for him, but he\u2019s only going to realise it when it\u2019s far, far too late. The bad guys This is clearly going to be a series in which the Shelbys are under siege and the introduction of McCavern added a whole new dimension to the battle in hand. Fans of Irish crime thriller Love/Hate will know that Gleeson is quite brilliant at being unhinged and the brief moments we saw of chief Billy Boy Jimmy suggested that he\u2019s going to have a fine old time bringing vengeance to Small Heath. That said I have my doubts about his understanding of game theory given that the brutal death of Bonnie Gold is only going to send Aberama on the sort of revenge mission that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a Sam Peckinpah movie. If Jimmy kills first and deals with the consequences later, Mosley is an altogether more slippery beast. I enjoyed the conversation between him, Tommy and Ada, not least because Sam Claflin is clearly having so much fun with the role. We also learned that Mosley has made some sort of contact with whom I would presume are the UVF, given the later suggestion that the Billy Boys provide security at his rallies. Although, it was kept just ambiguous enough to suggest that the MP might be trying to play both sides. That said, I suspect that the \u201cIrish question\u201d is just so much obfuscation on Mosley\u2019s part \u2013 his real interest lies in both Tommy\u2019s populism and his brutality, which he hopes to harness to his own ends. Notes from the boardroom From the bleak, western-style opening to the final scene paying homage to the great gangster films of the past, this episode was beautifully directed. All credit to Anthony Byrne. In an episode filled with brutal moments, the most devastating was one of the quietest as Tommy callously told Lizzie: \u201cYou know in my head I still pay you for it.\u201d The Billy Boys were a real-life gang \u2013 their song is still sung at Glasgow Rangers games to this day \u2013 and Gleeson\u2019s fictional character is clearly based on their leader, Billy Fullerton, who did indeed provide security for Mosley\u2019s fascist rallies. Those interested in learning more should check out Andrew Davies\u2019s fascinating book, City of Gangs. Did Polly believe Michael? I wasn\u2019t sure if she genuinely thought he was telling the truth or simply protected her only surviving child. Alas poor Arthur. He\u2019s going to be taking solace in a lot of Al Jolson records now that the newly sober Linda has clearly left. Finn\u2019s attempts to prove himself a Shelby \u201cGeneral\u201d continue to amuse me. I also like the fact that that clan are moving into fixing football as well as the horses. Hello to Emmett J Scanlan, of Hollyoaks and The Fall fame, who popped up as the under-pressure Billy Grade. Hurrah. Confirmation that Karl is both alive and also good at chess (I secretly think that one day Karl will inherit the world \u2013 as Ada\u2019s child he\u2019s bound to be the smartest of the new generation). Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week Full marks for the use of Nadine Shah\u2019s haunting Evil, a song about the corrosive nature of hate, ahead of Tommy\u2019s meeting with Mosley. Quote of the week \u201cMay Carleton spoke about you the way I imagine one might about a party they barely remembered, where you crash the car into the dovecote and live on champagne and cocaine for three whole days \u2013 you know that kind of party?\u201d He\u2019s a terrible human being but Mosley appreciates a good bash. So what did you think? Can Tommy possibly escape all his enemies? Who is the traitor in the Shelby camp? Or is there more than one? And where do you stand on the great Irish v Scottish whisk(e)y debate? As always all speculation and no spoilers welcome below \u2026",

      "bodyText": "The blog is going to finish here. There were wins for Johanna Konta, Novak Djokovic and Venus Williams, but Angelique Kerber crashed out. Thanks for reading. Bye. A big win for Reilly Opelka. The American youngster\u2019s beaten Fabio Fognini, seeded 11th, 6-3, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3. Well Venus Williams was in a hurry. The former champion beat Saisai Zheng 6-1, 6-0 in 65 minutes. By the way Andy Murray earlier got his first singles win since hip surgery at the start of the year. The world No1 is all smiles. His Spanish opponent was no match for him. Cripes, Reilly Opelka served for the match against Fabio Foginini, let the Italian off the hook, lost a tie-break and has been taken into a fourth set. The unpredictable Fognini might be dangerous now. Venus Williams is unlikely to go all the way, but she is a good bet to make the second round. Not the biggest of calls, mind you - she leads Saisai Zheng 6-1, 3-0. An odd, baffling match, in the grand Evans tradition, but the Brit is through to the second round after finding his feet in the fourth set. It was ugly, it was strange, it was angry from Evans at times, but he has the win and that\u2019s all that matters. Adrian Mannarino smashes up a racket and stands slumped at the back of the court, a picture of frustration and despair. He\u2019s been broken at the end of a draining game and Dan Evans, somehow, will serve for the match. Novak Djokovic isn\u2019t in the mood for any nonsense. He leads by two sets against the outgunned Roberto Carballes Baena. A hold for Dan Evans as the tension rises in the fourth set. He leads Adrian Mannarino 6-4, 6-3, 2-6, 4-3 and is two games from the second round. Can he clamber over the line? By the way Daniil Medvedev dealt with a troublesome hamstring and beat Pranjash Gunneswaran 6-4, 6-1, 6-2. A good win for the fifth seed. In other news American beanpole Reilly Opelka is dominating the No11 seed Fabio Fognini. The big-serving Opelka leads by two sets and a break. And now Djokovic is a set and a break up. He currently resides on Easy Street. Meanwhile 19-year-old Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska has beaten experienced Romanian Monica Niculescu 6-4, 1-6, 6-2. Novak Djokovic has taken the first set 6-4 against Roberto Carballes Baena. All very serene for the world No1. Angelique Kerber is out! The 2016 champion stormed back in the second set but Kristina Mladenovic recovered her poise to win 7-5, 0-6, 6-4. That\u2019s a great victory for the Frenchwoman. Novak Djokovic is 5-4 up in the first set against Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena and not having things all his own way. Dan Evans has lost the third set 6-2 against Mannarino having won the first two. Dan Evans was rocking half an hour ago. He was in a ratty mood and looked to be on the verge of an implosion. Instead he regained his poise and allowed his tennis to do the talking, a ploy which has seen him take a two-set lead over Adrian Mannarino. That\u2019s the cue for me to take a break and get some food. Jo Konta\u2019s second-round opponent will be another Russian \u2013 Margarita Gasparyan was comfortable against Priscilla Hon earlier. Fading force Tomas Berdych was sent on his way earlier, by the by. Jenson Brooksby, an 18-year-old American, beat Berdych in four sets. Daniil Medvedev has a two-set lead against Pranjesh Gunneswaran. Medvedev beat Djokovic recently. The young Russian\u2019s one to watch, though he insists he isn\u2019t a contender for the title. Modest, much? Speaking of Djokovic, he\u2019s about to get going against Spain\u2019s Roberto Carballes Baena. Good old Dan Evans. He was in danger of beating himself 10 minutes ago; now he\u2019s carved out a couple of breaks to lead Adrian Mannarino 6-4, 4-3. Daniil Medvedev, the fifth seed, is a set and a break up against Prajnesh Gunneswaran. Meanwhile Dan Evans has allowed his focus to waver against Adrian Mannarino, who\u2019s broken in the second set. Panic over for the world No2. Former champion Angelique Kerber finds herself a set down to Kristina Mladenovic, but the German leads by a break in set two. That one could go the distance. Dan Evans had a fine run here three years ago and he\u2019s looking good against Adrian Mannarino, snatching the opening set 6-4. Elsewhere Ash Barty appears to have steadied the ship against Zarina Diyas. The Australian leads by a break in the third set. Alex de Minaur is a set up against Pierre-Hugues Herbert. The Australian youngster took it 6-3. Elsewhere Dan Evans is about to serve for the first set against Adrian Mannarino. Ash Barty\u2019s feeling better now. The world No2\u2019s taken the second set 6-3 and levelled her match against Zarina Diyas. Meanwhile... It was angry at times, unconvincing at others, but in the end it\u2019s a deserved victory for the British No1, who seals it when her young Russian finishes with back-to-back double faults. The dangerous Petra Martic has passed an awkward examination against Tamara \u201cZizou\u201d Zidansek. The 22nd seed won 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. So Jo Konta does break again - and this time she consolidates the break and leads Daria Kasatkina 6-1, 4-6, 4-1. On Arthur Ashe, meanwhile, Ash Barty is faring better in set two against Zarina Diyas. The French Open champion was all over the place in the opening set, but she leads 3-2 in the second. Karolina Pliskova wasn\u2019t at her best, but she\u2019s through. She had a double break in the second set and still got taken to a second tie-break, but she\u2019s through. The third seed has beaten Tereza Martincova 7-6, 7-6. As for Jo Konta, she\u2019s going to have to break again against Daria Kasatkina. They\u2019e back on serve in the third set on Court 17. Johanna Konta clenches her fist at the end of a poor service game from Daria Kasatkina. The Russian misses a lot, too much, and is broken by the fired-up Brit, who leads 6-1, 4-6, 2-0. It\u2019s Konta\u2019s to lose again. Anastasija Sevastova got the job done against Eugenie Bouchard. A straightforward win for the 12th seed: 6-3, 6-3. Zarina Diyas has closed out that first set in impressive fashion, winning it 6-1 against Ashleigh Barty. The world No2 needs to sharpen up as a matter of urgency. An angry Johanna Konta has been dragged into a third set by Daria Kasatkina, who\u2019s nabbed the second 6-4. Elsewhere there\u2019s a shock brewing on Arthur Ashe, where Ash Barty is 5-0 down to Zarina Diyas. Caroline Garcia, the 27th seed and a top-10 player in the past, is out. She\u2019s lost 7-6, 6-2 to the unseeded Tunisian, Ons Jabeur. Ashleigh Barty\u2019s in a spot of bother early on. The world No2 trails 3-0 against Zarina Diyas. Johanna Konta is arguing with the umpire again. Another call\u2019s gone against her. Oh dear. Daria Kasatkina holds to lead 5-3 in the second set. The crowd are getting on Konta\u2019s back. Harriet Dart\u2019s tournament hasn\u2019t lasted long. The Londoner\u2019s been thrashed 6-3, 6-1 by Romania\u2019s Ana Bogdan. That\u2019s one Brit down. Johanna Konta is fuming on Court 17 after a disputed call goes against her. She engages in a long debate with the umpire, who isn\u2019t about to change his mind. Konta is doubly annoyed because she had a break point. She has another one, but she\u2019s too annoyed to play it properly and nets an easy backhand. Tomas Berdych, a semi-finalist here in 2012, was given the runaround by Jenson Brooksby in the first set, but he\u2019s woken up the second and taken it 6-2. And he\u2019s just broken at the start of the third set. On Arthur Ashe world No2 Ash Barty is underway against Zarina Diyas. On Louis Armstrong, meanwhile, Karolina Pliskova is a set and two breaks up against poor old Tereza Martincova now. A wobble from Johanna Konta and that allows Daria Kasatkina, who was blown away in 23 minutes in the first set, to break for a 3-2 lead in the second. The Russian has been threatening. Meanwhile Karolina Pliskova has won a first-set tie-break against Tereza Martincova, who served for it at 5-4. Kei Nishikori is through to the second round. The seventh seed\u2019s opponent, Marco Trungelliti, has retired while trailing 6-1, 4-1. Eugenie Bouchard - remember her? She\u2019s a set down to Anastasija Sevastova. It went 6-3 to the Latvian. Karolina Pliskova picks a good moment to raise her game. The third seed breaks back just when Tereza Martincova serves for the opening set. Then she holds to lead 6-5. Jo Konta is cruising, but another Brit\u2019s a set down. Harriet Dart trails Ana Bogdan, who took the opening set 6-3 on Court 14. Daria Kasatkina drags a forehand horribly wide and the first set is in the bag for Jo Konta, who takes it 6-1. All very polished from the British No1. Kei Nishikori\u2019s cruising against Marco Trungelliti. He\u2019s taken the first set 6-1 against the unseeded Argentinian. Meanwhile Tomas Berdych is in trouble against the USA\u2019s Jenson Brooksby, who\u2019s taken the first set 6-1 against the experienced Czech. Johanna Konta continues to dominate against Daria Kasatkina, who\u2019s making a lot of errors. Konta is looking too strong at the moment and breaks again to lead 4-1. Remember Eugenie Bouchard? The 2014 Wimbledon finalist doesn\u2019t last too long at the slams these days and she\u2019s made a slow start against Anastasija Sevastova on Court 5. The 12th seed leads 3-0. Elsewhere Kei Nishikori has an early break agaist Marco Trungelliti. A fine start for Johanna Konta, who breaks straight away on Court 17. Daria Kasatkina\u2019s in trouble early on. Elsewhere third seed Karolina Pliskova is struggling against Tereza Martincova in an all-Czech battle on Louis Armstrong. Martincova has the early break. And ... play. The 2019 US Open is underway! The players are out, the stands aren\u2019t particularly packed and we\u2019ll have tennis soon on a sunny day at Flushing Meadows. A fortnight of non-stop tennis starts here. Play will be underway soon and our early focus is on Johanna Konta. The British No1 got to the last eight at Wimbledon, where she blew up against Barbora Strycova, and hasn\u2019t been too hot since then. But she\u2019s feeling good and will feel she has the power to deal with Daria Kasatkina, a lovely, subtle player. Elsewhere Harriet Dart, who got to round three at Wimbledon, faces Romania\u2019s Ana Bogdan. Form guides Preparatory reading Recovered from Wimbledon yet? No? Too bad.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 27 August.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>A Labor donor says he was shocked to learn his $500 donation was inflated to $5,000 on official records.</strong> \u201cStanley\u201d Yip attended a fundraising dinner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/27/labor-donors-donation-inflated-from-500-to-5000-icac-documents-reveal\">at the centre of an explosive anti-corruption probe</a>. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is currently investigating a potentially unlawful donations scheme that may have helped to hide a $100,000 donation to Labor from Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire barred from donating in New South Wales due to his links to property development. Icac is examining whether \u201cstraw donors\u201d, or fake donors, were used to hide the true origin of Huang\u2019s $100,000 cash donation. Its inquiries have so far focused on a fundraising dinner organised by the Chinese Friends of Labor in March 2015, just weeks before the state election, where 12 separate donors gave Labor amounts that fell just below the legally allowed cap. Documents released by the Icac\u2019s Operation Aero show at least one guest at the fundraising dinner was sent a receipt for a donation of $5,000, despite having paid $500 for his ticket.</p> <p><strong>Drug overdoses kill one Australian every five hours,</strong> according to a new report. Fatal drug overdoses are more common in regional Victoria and NSW than anywhere else in Australia, and those deaths are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/27/drug-overdoses-kill-one-australian-every-54-hours\">increasingly linked to heroin</a>, the report has found. The overdose report by the Penington Institute, released on Tuesday, found that the number of deaths owing to unintentional drug overdose in Australia had increased 38% between 2001 and 2017 and was growing by 3.4% a year. The fastest-growing rates of death were in regional areas and among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who died of unintentional overdose at three times the rate of non-Indigenous people.</p> <p><strong>Sydney Catholic and Anglican churches say they will not back student climate strikes, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/27/sydney-anglican-and-catholic-schools-system-wont-back-student-climate-strike\">unlike the Uniting church, which has granted support to the school climate strike movement and given students support to attend the marches. </a>Students across the country are planning to walk out of school on Friday 20 September, to protest government inaction on the climate crisis. A spokesmen for the Sydney Anglican diocese and Sydney Catholic Schools told Guardian Australia they would not go as far as the Uniting church. Sydney Catholic Schools, which oversees 152 systemic schools, said it had to abide by the NSW education department\u2019s guidance on the strikes. \u201cWhile we are thrilled to see our students passionate about the environment, the best way for young people to really make a difference is to receive a quality education,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a19c7492238cb1ea573b9e9958a5bf56044fb66f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a19c7492238cb1ea573b9e9958a5bf56044fb66f/0_0_2468_1635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fire burning in the Amazon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Satellite data has recorded more than 41,000 fires in the Amazon region so far this year \u2013 more than half of those this month alone.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 27 August. Top stories A Labor donor says he was shocked to learn his $500 donation was inflated to $5,000 on official records. \u201cStanley\u201d Yip attended a fundraising dinner at the centre of an explosive anti-corruption probe. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is currently investigating a potentially unlawful donations scheme that may have helped to hide a $100,000 donation to Labor from Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire barred from donating in New South Wales due to his links to property development. Icac is examining whether \u201cstraw donors\u201d, or fake donors, were used to hide the true origin of Huang\u2019s $100,000 cash donation. Its inquiries have so far focused on a fundraising dinner organised by the Chinese Friends of Labor in March 2015, just weeks before the state election, where 12 separate donors gave Labor amounts that fell just below the legally allowed cap. Documents released by the Icac\u2019s Operation Aero show at least one guest at the fundraising dinner was sent a receipt for a donation of $5,000, despite having paid $500 for his ticket. Drug overdoses kill one Australian every five hours, according to a new report. Fatal drug overdoses are more common in regional Victoria and NSW than anywhere else in Australia, and those deaths are increasingly linked to heroin, the report has found. The overdose report by the Penington Institute, released on Tuesday, found that the number of deaths owing to unintentional drug overdose in Australia had increased 38% between 2001 and 2017 and was growing by 3.4% a year. The fastest-growing rates of death were in regional areas and among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who died of unintentional overdose at three times the rate of non-Indigenous people. Sydney Catholic and Anglican churches say they will not back student climate strikes, unlike the Uniting church, which has granted support to the school climate strike movement and given students support to attend the marches. Students across the country are planning to walk out of school on Friday 20 September, to protest government inaction on the climate crisis. A spokesmen for the Sydney Anglican diocese and Sydney Catholic Schools told Guardian Australia they would not go as far as the Uniting church. Sydney Catholic Schools, which oversees 152 systemic schools, said it had to abide by the NSW education department\u2019s guidance on the strikes. \u201cWhile we are thrilled to see our students passionate about the environment, the best way for young people to really make a difference is to receive a quality education,\u201d a spokesman said. World Leaders at the G7 have agreed to a US$20m (AU$29.5m) plan to help Amazon countries fight wildfires. It was announced by the French and Chilean presidents on Monday and will involve a program of reforestation, to be unveiled at the UN general assembly meeting next month. Donald Trump, who skipped G7 talks on the climate crisis and the Amazon fires, has meanwhile defended his bid to host the next G7 at his Miami resort. French president Emmanuel Macron has condemned what he called \u201cextraordinarily rude\u201d comments made about his wife by far-right Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, escalating their diplomatic clash. Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to rule out proroguing parliament to try to force a no-deal Brexit. The European Union, meanwhile, would refuse to negotiate a trade deal with the UK if the government reneged on the Brexit bill, EU sources have said. A UN spokesman has called for maximum restraint after a reported drone attack in a Hezbollah stronghold south of Beirut that was blamed on Israel. \u201cIt is imperative for all to avoid an escalation,\u201d he said. KFC is was working with meat substitute company Beyond Meat on a one-day trial of plant-based chicken nuggets and wings. The product is called Beyond Fried Chicken and comes with the tagline \u201ca Kentucky fried miracle\u201d. Harvey Weinstein has pleaded not guilty on Monday to a new indictment that included revised charges of predatory sexual assault. The revisions have forced the delay of Weinstein\u2019s trial from 9 September to 6 January 2020. Opinion and analysis Recent figures show just how much the working life for women has changed over the past 40 years, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cPolicy over the past 20 to 30 years to make work more flexible for women with children and to increase the availability and affordability of childcare does look to have had the impact of keeping women working. But the data also highlights that women still face the same struggles that come with being the one who goes part-time \u2013 the drop in superannuation, and the likely losing out on the promotional path and the higher pay that goes with it.\u201d A first-of-its-kind study of racism in Australian schools has found one in three students report being the victim of racial discrimination by their peers. Researchers from two universities surveyed 4,600 primary and secondary students at government schools in NSW and Victoria on their experiences of racial discrimination in schools.

Close to 20% of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background reported experiences of racial discrimination from their teachers. Sport This AFL season has provided many memorable moments, but what of the vanquished? What of the teams who missed the eight, variously promising much, threatening to achieve but in the end leaving fans unfulfilled, unhappy and with no plans for September. Scott Heinrich analyses what went right for the also-rans, what ultimately went wrong, and what can be done to reverse their fortunes next year. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen loves a punt, writes Matt McILraith. \u201cIn moving Beauden Barrett from first five-eighth to fullback just two months \u2013 and four Test matches \u2013 out from the tournament in Japan, the noted racehorse owner has already taken arguably the biggest wager of his All Blacks coaching career.\u201d Thinking time: The Problem with Natural Born Killers Natural Born Killers came to theatres 25 years ago, only a few short months after OJ Simpson\u2019s infamous flight from justice in a white Ford Bronco in June.

      "body": "<p>George Warleggan appears, pistol in each hand, before taking out a French general and wounding the man who is about to kill Ross, and it may go down as the moment the show really lost it. I laughed out loud \u2013 for all Poldark\u2019s intentional light relief, it is the earnest parts that make me want to giggle, although until now it has somehow managed to stay on the right side of ridiculous.</p> <p>It was the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b07pn8mz/poldark\" title=\"\">last ever episode</a> \u2013 supposedly \u2013 of the gloriously entertaining show that has run on BBC One for five series. It has pushed me to my limits with its jumpy approach to time and ludicrous storylines, and the finale nearly sent me over the edge. And yet, like that moment when Dwight Enys grabbed George as he was about to go over the Cornish clifftop in episode three, they pulled it back. Just.</p> <p>Five months have passed since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/25/poldark-series-five-episode-seven-recap-well-that-was-exhausting\" title=\"\">the penultimate episode</a>. Morwenna is heavily pregnant, Caroline is still \u2013 implausibly \u2013 on at Dwight about being in love with Kitty Despard and Ross is acting strangely (as he warned Dwight he would). Demelza knows he is up to something, but suspects that something is troublemaker Tess Tregidden \u2013 devastatingly confirmed to her when she follows him. Heartbroken, she packs for Killewarren, Caroline\u2019s house. \u201cWhen did I lose you, Ross? I look in your face and see a stranger.\u201d He can\u2019t tell her the truth, which is that he has infiltrated a French gang \u2013 ahead of a French invasion \u2013 and stringing Tess along is supposedly all part of it.</p> <p>But the invasion is on \u2013 and before the peace agreement is to be signed! French general Jules Toussaint turns up at Nampara, news of which finds its way back to George and the slave traders at Trenwith. They are delighted that Ross appears to be betraying his country.</p> <p>But Ross \u2013 of course \u2013 has a plan. Dwight has to hide under a floorboard, and Zacky and the Carne boys have to do something with gunpowder. With Poldarkian speed, it all gets going \u2013 Ross and the general discuss plans, while Dwight, hidden under the floor, takes notes. But the document \u2013 bound for Wickham in London \u2013 is intercepted. Huzzah! Proof that Ross is a traitor. But what\u2019s this? He is actually acting as an undercover agent? \u201cDamn him. So he\u2019ll be crowned as a hero,\u201d sulks George. Unless they inform the general that he\u2019s been had, they decide, treacherously.</p> <p>There follows a sequence as hammy and cheesy as a croque monsieur. \u201cForgive me if your carpet is stained, madam,\u201d says Toussaint to Demelza, now he knows of Ross\u2019s double-crossing, \u201cbut I must perform a small execution before we resume our conversation.\u201d Demelza, always the quickest-witted Poldark, pretends to side with the Frenchman. \u201cCan you truly think to rid me of this fiend?\u201d she says, standing between her husband and Toussaint, stalling for time. For some reason \u2013 something to do with artistry \u2013 Toussaint decides not to shoot Ross and have a duel instead.</p> <p>Their moonlit swordfight seems to go on for so long that by the time Hanson decides to take matters into his own hands and shoot Ross himself, you\u2019re almost cheering him on. And then George appears in his Tarantino moment, guns blazing. \u201cI\u2019d rather you kill the other one but we mustn\u2019t be greedy,\u201d says Ross, before they discuss whether to finish Hanson off and dispose of the bodies. If you have stuck with Poldark this far, you have a fairly high tolerance for such nonsense. There is a kind of rapprochement between George and Ross, arch-enemies all this time. \u201cI\u2019m indebted to you, nonetheless,\u201d says Ross, \u201cwhich is not a position I relish.\u201d George smirks: \u201cWhereas I revel in it.\u201d</p> <p>There is just time to wrap it all up, and fairly satisfying it is too. Morwenna and Drake have a baby girl. Dwight and Caroline have a most touching scene, confronting the grief of losing their daughter but with hope for their future. Sam and the sweet-faced Rosina get married. Geoffrey Charles has his place back at military school. Even Valentine (Ross\u2019s secret son) gets his own mine \u2013 but not the knowledge of his true father. George, his supposed dad, asks the Poldarks not to see him any more. \u201cHe is, after all, no relation,\u201d he says, all pride and gritted teeth. Most importantly, Horace, Caroline\u2019s pug, seems to have recovered from the poisoning incident. </p> <p>Which just leaves Ross and Demelza. With everything they\u2019ve been through \u2013 and put the other through \u2013 they end the show as equals. Ross says she saved his life. \u201cAs you saved mine, long ago. When you took me from a dog fight, made me your scullery maid, and then your wife,\u201d she replies. Quite why, even now, she puts up with him \u2013 he\u2019s going off to be a spy in France while she\u2019s pregnant \u2013 is one of the enduring mysteries of her character. Still, it allows the tantalising prospect that this isn\u2019t the end, not really. She expects him back for the harvest (a chance for him to get that scythe out again). One last bit of Poldark smouldering: \u201cI swear to you, my love, I will return.\u201d It\u2019s silly, eye-roll-inducing and the perfect farewell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Warleggan appears, pistol in each hand, before taking out a French general and wounding the man who is about to kill Ross, and it may go down as the moment the show really lost it. I laughed out loud \u2013 for all Poldark\u2019s intentional light relief, it is the earnest parts that make me want to giggle, although until now it has somehow managed to stay on the right side of ridiculous. It was the last ever episode \u2013 supposedly \u2013 of the gloriously entertaining show that has run on BBC One for five series. It has pushed me to my limits with its jumpy approach to time and ludicrous storylines, and the finale nearly sent me over the edge. And yet, like that moment when Dwight Enys grabbed George as he was about to go over the Cornish clifftop in episode three, they pulled it back. Just. Five months have passed since the penultimate episode. Morwenna is heavily pregnant, Caroline is still \u2013 implausibly \u2013 on at Dwight about being in love with Kitty Despard and Ross is acting strangely (as he warned Dwight he would). Demelza knows he is up to something, but suspects that something is troublemaker Tess Tregidden \u2013 devastatingly confirmed to her when she follows him. Heartbroken, she packs for Killewarren, Caroline\u2019s house. \u201cWhen did I lose you, Ross? I look in your face and see a stranger.\u201d He can\u2019t tell her the truth, which is that he has infiltrated a French gang \u2013 ahead of a French invasion \u2013 and stringing Tess along is supposedly all part of it. But the invasion is on \u2013 and before the peace agreement is to be signed! French general Jules Toussaint turns up at Nampara, news of which finds its way back to George and the slave traders at Trenwith. They are delighted that Ross appears to be betraying his country. But Ross \u2013 of course \u2013 has a plan. Dwight has to hide under a floorboard, and Zacky and the Carne boys have to do something with gunpowder. With Poldarkian speed, it all gets going \u2013 Ross and the general discuss plans, while Dwight, hidden under the floor, takes notes. But the document \u2013 bound for Wickham in London \u2013 is intercepted. Huzzah! Proof that Ross is a traitor. But what\u2019s this? He is actually acting as an undercover agent? \u201cDamn him. So he\u2019ll be crowned as a hero,\u201d sulks George. Unless they inform the general that he\u2019s been had, they decide, treacherously. There follows a sequence as hammy and cheesy as a croque monsieur. \u201cForgive me if your carpet is stained, madam,\u201d says Toussaint to Demelza, now he knows of Ross\u2019s double-crossing, \u201cbut I must perform a small execution before we resume our conversation.\u201d Demelza, always the quickest-witted Poldark, pretends to side with the Frenchman. \u201cCan you truly think to rid me of this fiend?\u201d she says, standing between her husband and Toussaint, stalling for time. For some reason \u2013 something to do with artistry \u2013 Toussaint decides not to shoot Ross and have a duel instead. Their moonlit swordfight seems to go on for so long that by the time Hanson decides to take matters into his own hands and shoot Ross himself, you\u2019re almost cheering him on. And then George appears in his Tarantino moment, guns blazing. \u201cI\u2019d rather you kill the other one but we mustn\u2019t be greedy,\u201d says Ross, before they discuss whether to finish Hanson off and dispose of the bodies. If you have stuck with Poldark this far, you have a fairly high tolerance for such nonsense. There is a kind of rapprochement between George and Ross, arch-enemies all this time. \u201cI\u2019m indebted to you, nonetheless,\u201d says Ross, \u201cwhich is not a position I relish.\u201d George smirks: \u201cWhereas I revel in it.\u201d There is just time to wrap it all up, and fairly satisfying it is too. Morwenna and Drake have a baby girl. Dwight and Caroline have a most touching scene, confronting the grief of losing their daughter but with hope for their future. Sam and the sweet-faced Rosina get married. Geoffrey Charles has his place back at military school. Even Valentine (Ross\u2019s secret son) gets his own mine \u2013 but not the knowledge of his true father. George, his supposed dad, asks the Poldarks not to see him any more. \u201cHe is, after all, no relation,\u201d he says, all pride and gritted teeth. Most importantly, Horace, Caroline\u2019s pug, seems to have recovered from the poisoning incident. Which just leaves Ross and Demelza. With everything they\u2019ve been through \u2013 and put the other through \u2013 they end the show as equals. Ross says she saved his life. \u201cAs you saved mine, long ago. When you took me from a dog fight, made me your scullery maid, and then your wife,\u201d she replies. Quite why, even now, she puts up with him \u2013 he\u2019s going off to be a spy in France while she\u2019s pregnant \u2013 is one of the enduring mysteries of her character. Still, it allows the tantalising prospect that this isn\u2019t the end, not really. She expects him back for the harvest (a chance for him to get that scythe out again). One last bit of Poldark smouldering: \u201cI swear to you, my love, I will return.\u201d It\u2019s silly, eye-roll-inducing and the perfect farewell.",

Not so much with a bang or a whimper but with a series of bangs that left us with a bit of a headache. (I wish.

Was it too much powder? Or simply what was needed for a proper job? It\u2019s hard to say. But I think a fair assessment is that there was enough going on here to last us another few years of Poldark, so it was kind of annoying that it had to end this way, wrapped up so abruptly, almost with the action on fast-forward to get through it all in time.</p> \n<p>In the end it was pretty great television. There was just too much of everything. \u201cThe agony of never just a moment\u2019s peace! It\u2019s my faith that\u2019s broken. It can\u2019t be remade.\u201d Well, we know how you feel Demelza. The first 27 minutes of this were agony, us not entirely knowing whether Ross had gone bad or whether he was just doing his James Bond act. It became extremely confusing knowing who was on what side and extremely stressful worrying about whether Sir Evil George and the slave traders would foil everything.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3a65bc6d90bae1643e5a80d0c3c63de171d7658\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3a65bc6d90bae1643e5a80d0c3c63de171d7658/0_143_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They also wanted us to think, \u201cHas Ross really gone over to the dark side?\u201d\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They also wanted us to think, \u201cHas Ross really gone over to the dark side?\u201d\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If the \u201cRoss as double agent\u201d storyline had one flaw, it was that they couldn\u2019t decide whether to let the viewers in on the secret or not. They wanted it both ways. They wanted us to know that he wasn\u2019t really cheating on Demelza and that it was all for the mission. But they also wanted us to think, \u201cHas he really gone over to the dark side?\u201d This is an incredibly ambitious effect to try to pull off and it didn\u2019t quite work.</p> \n<p>There were times when as a viewer you just didn\u2019t know whether you were coming or going. We were told at the beginning that this was all \u201cfive months later\u201d, which was supposed to explain Ross\u2019s personality transplant. \u201cYour wife asks no questions?\u201d \u201cMy wife knows her place.\u201d Er, hello, have you met Demelza? And what on earth is this liaison with Tess? And the business about being a humble country squire? But of course it was all a ruse. \u201cYou \u2019ad all them Frenchies fooled and me besides.\u201d</p> \n<p>Aside from this slightly messy masquerade, there were many exciting moments, some supremely joyous, some unbearably sad. We got to see some great scenes between Ross and Demelza, even if they were weighted with falsehood (because he was keeping his spying secret). \u201cHow needful would you say is honesty betwixt husband and wife?\u201d Oh dear. We\u2019ve been here before. We had poor, broken Demelza: \u201cWhen did I lose you, Ross? When I look at your face, I see a stranger.\u201d And then we had triumphant, wily Demelza: \u201cI should like to see him humiliated before his dispatch.\u201d How did her mind leap to such a plan! Because she is most excellent, that is why!</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4222a81dbae8f556984e8781964f2af0fd357a6b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4222a81dbae8f556984e8781964f2af0fd357a6b/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018So many people got caught in the crossfire.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So many people got caught in the crossfire.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was irritating, of course, that so many people got caught in the crossfire of Ross\u2019s patriotically well-intentioned lies. If it wasn\u2019t bad enough that Demelza and Ross were at each other\u2019s throats then here were Dr Enys and Sindy Doll doing the same thing. And Dr Enys was supposed to have been holding a candle for Kitty? Added to that the sadness of Sindy Doll holding the girl baby! Unbearable! (Morwenna\u2019s baby!) But how very joyous to see their reconciliation and the opening of Caroline\u2019s heart. \u201cWithout such opening, are we yet but half a life?\u201d</p> \n<p>And finally we came to the weird reconciliation of Ross and Sir Evil George. It\u2019s never a good thing when Sir Evil George gets his hands on one, let alone two, pistols. But for once it worked out. \u201cDispose of both bodies. Who would know?\u201d He might make a revolutionary yet. I thought they could have gone farther emotionally in these scenes. \u201cMight I suggest a brandy?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThink I might poison you?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\u201d But we stayed close to reality and just as we thought Sir Evil George might asked Ross and Demelza to take in Valentine, he pulled back.</p> \n<p>Many thanks to all the \u2019Darkers who have followed this blog these many long years. And who have conjured up a below-the-line community that be joyfully affectionate and affectionately critical at same time. And congratulations to the writer, Debbie Horsfield, who created this great unwieldy anachronistic beast of a story for television and almost \u2013 almost \u2013 managed to tame it. I thought a flashback to Elizabeth was missing in this episode. And there definitely wasn\u2019t enough Prudie. But still. \u201cWhere\u2019s our faith? Where\u2019s our gratitude?\u201d It\u2019s still here. \u201cTwo hearts. One beat. Can\u2019t ask any more than that. There isn\u2019t any more to ask.\u201d Well, except for the utter destruction of Sir Evil George.

      "bodyText": "Ah, \u2019Darkers. Here \u2019twas. The end of an era. And so \u2019tis only right that there be many fireworks. \u201cI may have used a little too much powder,\u201d grinned Zacky. \u201cProper job!\u201d And so ended our life in Nampara. Not so much with a bang or a whimper but with a series of bangs that left us with a bit of a headache. (I wish. Let\u2019s not dwell on that metaphor.) What a great deal of powder indeed was used for this episode! Was it too much powder? Or simply what was needed for a proper job? It\u2019s hard to say. But I think a fair assessment is that there was enough going on here to last us another few years of Poldark, so it was kind of annoying that it had to end this way, wrapped up so abruptly, almost with the action on fast-forward to get through it all in time. In the end it was pretty great television. There was just too much of everything. \u201cThe agony of never just a moment\u2019s peace! It\u2019s my faith that\u2019s broken. It can\u2019t be remade.\u201d Well, we know how you feel Demelza. The first 27 minutes of this were agony, us not entirely knowing whether Ross had gone bad or whether he was just doing his James Bond act. It became extremely confusing knowing who was on what side and extremely stressful worrying about whether Sir Evil George and the slave traders would foil everything. If the \u201cRoss as double agent\u201d storyline had one flaw, it was that they couldn\u2019t decide whether to let the viewers in on the secret or not. They wanted it both ways. They wanted us to know that he wasn\u2019t really cheating on Demelza and that it was all for the mission. But they also wanted us to think, \u201cHas he really gone over to the dark side?\u201d This is an incredibly ambitious effect to try to pull off and it didn\u2019t quite work. There were times when as a viewer you just didn\u2019t know whether you were coming or going. We were told at the beginning that this was all \u201cfive months later\u201d, which was supposed to explain Ross\u2019s personality transplant. \u201cYour wife asks no questions?\u201d \u201cMy wife knows her place.\u201d Er, hello, have you met Demelza? And what on earth is this liaison with Tess? And the business about being a humble country squire? But of course it was all a ruse. \u201cYou \u2019ad all them Frenchies fooled and me besides.\u201d Aside from this slightly messy masquerade, there were many exciting moments, some supremely joyous, some unbearably sad. We got to see some great scenes between Ross and Demelza, even if they were weighted with falsehood (because he was keeping his spying secret). \u201cHow needful would you say is honesty betwixt husband and wife?\u201d Oh dear. We\u2019ve been here before. We had poor, broken Demelza: \u201cWhen did I lose you, Ross? When I look at your face, I see a stranger.\u201d And then we had triumphant, wily Demelza: \u201cI should like to see him humiliated before his dispatch.\u201d How did her mind leap to such a plan! Because she is most excellent, that is why! It was irritating, of course, that so many people got caught in the crossfire of Ross\u2019s patriotically well-intentioned lies. If it wasn\u2019t bad enough that Demelza and Ross were at each other\u2019s throats then here were Dr Enys and Sindy Doll doing the same thing. And Dr Enys was supposed to have been holding a candle for Kitty? Added to that the sadness of Sindy Doll holding the girl baby! Unbearable! (Morwenna\u2019s baby!) But how very joyous to see their reconciliation and the opening of Caroline\u2019s heart. \u201cWithout such opening, are we yet but half a life?\u201d And finally we came to the weird reconciliation of Ross and Sir Evil George. It\u2019s never a good thing when Sir Evil George gets his hands on one, let alone two, pistols. But for once it worked out. \u201cDispose of both bodies. Who would know?\u201d He might make a revolutionary yet. I thought they could have gone farther emotionally in these scenes. \u201cMight I suggest a brandy?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThink I might poison you?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\u201d But we stayed close to reality and just as we thought Sir Evil George might asked Ross and Demelza to take in Valentine, he pulled back. Many thanks to all the \u2019Darkers who have followed this blog these many long years. And who have conjured up a below-the-line community that be joyfully affectionate and affectionately critical at same time. And congratulations to the writer, Debbie Horsfield, who created this great unwieldy anachronistic beast of a story for television and almost \u2013 almost \u2013 managed to tame it. I thought a flashback to Elizabeth was missing in this episode. And there definitely wasn\u2019t enough Prudie. But still. \u201cWhere\u2019s our faith? Where\u2019s our gratitude?\u201d It\u2019s still here. \u201cTwo hearts. One beat. Can\u2019t ask any more than that. There isn\u2019t any more to ask.\u201d Well, except for the utter destruction of Sir Evil George. But that, my friends, will have to wait for another day. Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor This has to go to Demelza, of course. She had to go through approximately 197 emotional states in this episode from \u201cwoman scorned\u201d and Mata Hari to Call the Midwife and Mr and Mrs. If it wasn\u2019t enough that Demelza had survived (a) thinking that Ross was having it off with Tess (b) saving him by encouraging the nasty Frenchman to do the sword-fighting (c ) being a midwife two seconds later to Loveday Carne. (Silly name!) Obviously we can\u2019t praise Aidan Turner enough for his portrayal of Ross (who is himself sometimes very silly indeed and not an easy role to imbue with verisimilitude). But without Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza, I don\u2019t think this show would have resonated in the way it has. The two of them excel as a couple. But they are also both able to carry individual scenes with incredible poignancy and weight. Demelza had to do this doubly in this episode: having to act out an eventuality that the viewer knew to be untrue but still make it look true to us. That is virtually impossible. Except for Demelza, of course, for whom nothing is impossible. Not even making the same green coat look fresh every time she wears it, despite owning it for 11 years. Classic Poldark lines \u201cSome days I almost forget her face for two hours at a time.\u201d Oh Geoffrey Charles, you are as soppy as your father. \u201cI got bigger fish to fry than \u2019e now, preacher.\u201d Sure you have, girl. Tess was given a bit more nuance in her character in this episode and she did well with it, even making us feel a bit sorry for her. Beware hubris, \u2019Darkers! It don\u2019t lead to marriage to a hot preacher. \u201cDo \u2019e not think \u2019e deserve as much joy? For who in this world have never gone astray?\u201d Who indeed, Rosena? Ah, it would be a hard-hearted viewer who wouldn\u2019t weep at this. \u201cMy only thought was to protect you.\u201d \u201cRoss, I\u2019ve always been indebted to you.\u201d \u201cMy debt to you can never be repaid. But for the rest of my life, I will try.\u201d I\u2019m not crying. You\u2019re crying. Regulation reverse-sexism bare chest moment Well, he\u2019s coming back to bring in the corn so there\u2019s always hope. Only we won\u2019t be seeing it. Except for in our dreams, \u2019Darkers.

As Britain baked in sunshine, the England men\u2019s football team even managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/11/england-croatia-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\">reach a World Cup semi-final</a>.</p> \n<p>But while temperatures in Britain remained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/03/summer-2018-uk-joint-hottest-on-record-met-office-says\">just the right side</a> of uncomfortably hot, much of Europe experienced serious extremes, in the continent\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/04/temperatures-in-southern-europe-top-45-heatwave-spain-portugal\">warmest August on record</a>. And far from being confined to the area around the Mediterranean, even Scandinavia had worryingly hot weather.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a38f0f29-4edd-426f-9e7f-3706fd5cca1e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.</p>\n    <p>Global heating does not influence all extreme weather \u2013 natural variability still exists. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world\">Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies</a> and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The heatwave was part of a wider rise in temperatures across much of the northern hemisphere. Specifically, it was the result of the north Atlantic jet stream being weaker than usual, which meant the regular arrival of low-pressure systems from the west was blocked, so high-pressure systems with warm, sunny weather stayed in place for weeks on end.</p> \n<p>At first, Europeans mostly enjoyed the heat \u2013 especially in the north, where summers can be comparatively dismal. But as time went on, with no relief from the searing sunshine, the mood changed. For the first time in decades \u2013 perhaps since the drought of 1976 \u2013 people were praying for rain. The heatwave eventually broke in early September, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/18/storm-ali-uk-weather-80mph-winds\">unsettled weather arriving</a> from the west.</p> \n<p>For some, it was too late. In July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/23/greeks-urged-to-leave-homes-as-wildfires-spread-near-athens\">wildfires broke out</a> along the coast south of Athens, killing more than 100 people.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last year brought the summer of the heatwave. As Britain baked in sunshine, the England men\u2019s football team even managed to reach a World Cup semi-final. But while temperatures in Britain remained just the right side of uncomfortably hot, much of Europe experienced serious extremes, in the continent\u2019s warmest August on record. And far from being confined to the area around the Mediterranean, even Scandinavia had worryingly hot weather. The heatwave was part of a wider rise in temperatures across much of the northern hemisphere. Specifically, it was the result of the north Atlantic jet stream being weaker than usual, which meant the regular arrival of low-pressure systems from the west was blocked, so high-pressure systems with warm, sunny weather stayed in place for weeks on end. At first, Europeans mostly enjoyed the heat \u2013 especially in the north, where summers can be comparatively dismal. But as time went on, with no relief from the searing sunshine, the mood changed. For the first time in decades \u2013 perhaps since the drought of 1976 \u2013 people were praying for rain. The heatwave eventually broke in early September, with unsettled weather arriving from the west. For some, it was too late. In July, wildfires broke out along the coast south of Athens, killing more than 100 people.",

      "bodyText": "Victoria police has \u201cunacceptably high\u201d levels of sexual harassment and discrimination, with 25.8% of female employees and 9.8% of male employees reporting having experienced sexual harassment at work, a report by the state\u2019s human rights body has found. The finding was included in the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission\u2019s third and final report into sexual harassment and discrimination in Victoria police, released on Tuesday. The first report, published in 2015, found sexual harassment was rife. A separate report found high rates of homophobic \u201cbanter\u201d and discrimination against LGBT officers. However, VEOHRC found the police organisation\u2019s top-down commitment to becoming a more gender-equitable workforce had made a noticeable cultural change. The report included a recommendation to the Andrews government that the human rights body be granted greater powers to undertake its investigations. Stronger powers under the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 would allow VEOHRC to conduct similar work on less open organisations. An attempt to conduct a similar investigation into Victoria\u2019s fire services in 2016 was boycotted. Commissioner Kristen Hilton said the leadership shown by the top ranks of Victoria police was \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to achieving systemic change, and commended the organisation for being prepared to be criticised in public for its failings. \u201cThey have been prepared to listen to the quite harrowing stories of members in their workforce, and that\u2019s shown quite a lot of humility,\u201d Hilton told Guardian Australia. \u201cBeing able to say: \u2018Yep, we did not protect our people very well\u2019.\u201d In some areas, the latest report found, police officers were still not being protected. A victim-centric complaints process, recommended in the first report in 2015, has not been established. Respondents to a survey of Victoria police staff in late 2018 said that senior officers were still able to get away with harassment and 30% said they feared retribution if they reported harassment or discrimination. One respondent said that personal information about their private life \u201cwas shared amongst other employees and discussed openly in attempts to discredit my reputation\u201d. But Hilton said in other areas of structural change there had been significant improvement and genuine commitment to gender equality. Victoria police has said it is committed to becoming a gender-equitable organisation both for the sake of its staff and to better deal with family violence, which makes up between 40-60% of police call-outs. Hilton said assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius told her last week that in the past, a woman who attended a police station to make a complaint of family violence might have been told \u201ccome back when you\u2019ve got bruises\u201d. \u201cIt was just apparent to them that views inside the organisation around not respecting women, or sidelining women, or denigrating women, and working in an environment which was not gender equitable, was influencing the way in which they responded to or understood family violence,\u201d Hilton said. In a foreword to the report, commissioner Graham Ashton said Victoria police would \u201cmaintain an explicit focus on gender equality as this will give us the best chance of addressing the drivers of sexual harassment, sex discrimination and predatory behaviour\u201d. \u201cI am confident that this is work we are capable of leading, both for the benefit of our employees and the community,\u201d he said. The gender pay gap in the organisation has narrowed by almost 2% since a salary audit was conducted in 2016, falling from 9.5% \u2013 with women earning an average salary of $78,508 compared with an average salary of $86,734 for men \u2013 to 7.6% in 2018. Women received 40% of promotions to command appointments between 2015 and 2018, and one in 10 women who applied for a promotion in that period were successful, compared with one in 20 men. Victoria police has committed to a 50:50 target for both recruitment and promotion and has committed to achieving gender equality in its organisation by 2030.",

In a six-page document prepared for Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, laid out how any such move by the prime minister would be open to immediate legal challenge in the courts. She said it could be subject to judicial review and the courts \u201cmight well even grant interim injunctive relief in order to allow both houses of parliament to continue to sit and discharge their primary and sovereign constitutional role in this current moment of national crisis\u201d. The advice from Chakrabarti, a barrister, was commissioned by Labour after leaked emails showed No 10 had sought the counsel of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, on whether a five-week prorogation from 9 September might be possible to avoid a confidence vote and help enable a no-deal Brexit. The initial legal guidance for No 10 was that shutting parliament may be possible, unless action being taken in the courts by anti-Brexit campaigners succeeds in the meantime. Johnson was pressed repeatedly on Monday on what he would do if MPs tried to thwart his Brexit policy \u2013 at a press conference at the close of the G7 summit in Biarritz.

Asked explicitly whether he would consider proroguing parliament, he said: \u201cI rely on parliamentarians to do the right thing and honour the pledge that they made to the people of this country.\u201d Parliament could be shut from 9 September until 14 October \u2013 two weeks before Johnson has promised to implement Brexit with or without a deal \u2013 under the plan being considered by No 10. The official reason would be a break before a Queen\u2019s speech setting out Johnson\u2019s legislative programme, but it would have the effect of stopping MPs legislating against a no-deal Brexit or ousting the prime minister. Chakrabarti\u2019s legal advice, seen by the Guardian, argues any such move would be subject to legal challenge and the courts could intervene to make sure parliament sits while any dispute about prorogation is resolved. She also cited the Gina Miller case brought against the government to ensure MPs had to give permission for triggering article 50 as an example of where the courts have found parliament to be sovereign in relation to the EU referendum result. \u201cThe justices were clear that the referendum was in itself a creature of parliament and absent any specific legislative provision to the contrary, its result remains a political rather than a legally binding outcome and therefore subject to normal constitutional principles in the pursuit of its implementation,\u201d she said.

Corbyn is preparing to meet Westminster opposition leaders at his office in parliament on Tuesday, including Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats and Ian Blackford of the SNP, to discuss how they could work together to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. However, there are tactical divisions among the rebels. The Labour leader hopes to win a vote of no confidence and has offered to then lead a short-term caretaker government for the sole purpose of extending article 50 and calling a general election, in which Labour would argue for a referendum on a Brexit deal or remaining in the EU. But Swinson has warned Corbyn would be unlikely to command a majority in the House of Commons, and pointed to alternative candidates, including the veteran Tory MP and remainer Ken Clarke. No 10 remains confident Johnson can achieve Brexit on 31 October. Speaking in Biarritz, where the prime minister met the European council president, Donald Tusk, a senior UK government official said Johnson had delivered the message to EU leaders that Brexit cannot be stopped. \u201cThe prime minister has been very clear to European leaders that he\u2019s seen in the last week that the idea that Brexit can be stopped is incorrect and we are leaving on 31 October,\u201d they said. \u201cHe thinks that EU leaders should not be listening to the very wrong messages emerging from some parliamentarians who think that they will stop Brexit. \u201cThe prime minister has been repeatedly clear that parliamentarians and politicians don\u2019t get to choose which public votes they respect.\u201d Asked about prorogation, the official said: \u201cNo 10 commissions legal advice on a whole range of issues, but the PM is clear that he is not going to stop MPs debating Brexit.\u201d There has been little sign of progress on Brexit at the G7 summit, despite Johnson\u2019s insistence he would meet the \u201cblistering\u201d challenge set by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of coming up with a new deal within 30 days.

      "body": "<p>Some quirky things are happening in English football\u2019s top flight. For the first time since 1955, 15 or more clubs have won one of their opening three matches. Another Opta stat doing the rounds on social media on the weekend, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oilysailor?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">courtesy of Duncan Alexander,</a> revealed that the last time 19 or more teams had three points after three games was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oilysailor/status/1165707330698260481\" title=\"\">in 1981-82</a>, the first season after Jimmy Hill and others had successfully campaigned for the introduction of three points for a win.</p> <p>So, if English football is travelling back in time, what does it mean? The short and simple answer is probably not a lot, other than you can throw a blanket over the majority of the clubs in the Premier League right now, so much so that Newcastle, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/tottenham-lacking-unity-desire-mauricio-pochettino\" title=\"\">enjoyed a terrific win at Tottenham</a> on Sunday, are second from bottom of the table and also one point off fifth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oilysailor/status/1165707330698260481\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">First time since 1981-82 that 19 or more teams have had 3pts after 3 games. Then 20/22 teams had done it, all of them utterly confused about Jimmy Hill&#39;s new &#39;three points for a win&#39; rule. <a href=\"https://t.co/PZenZiVCmZ\">https://t.co/PZenZiVCmZ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FfjblV77Jj\">pic.twitter.com/FfjblV77Jj</a></p>&mdash; Duncan Alexander (@oilysailor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oilysailor/status/1165707330698260481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 25, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Watford, who are the only team without at least three points and already in danger of being cut adrift after losing their first three fixtures (said tongue-in-cheek, to be clear), travel to St James\u2019 Park on Saturday for a meeting between the bottom two. An early relegation six-pointer. Or, depending on whether your glass of Newcastle Brown Ale is half full or half empty, a chance for Steve Bruce\u2019s side to push for a place in the top six before the international break.</p> <p>That so many clubs are already up and running (there was only one previous occasion when 18 of the 20 Premier League clubs had registered a win at this stage), means the table has an unusually congested feel, even allowing for the fact we are talking about statistics after such a ridiculously small sample of games and at a time of the season when the kids haven\u2019t even gone back to school.</p> <p>On the face of it the current state of play is no bad thing. Leaving aside the football accumulators that are being ruined, there appears to be much to welcome about the idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/manchester-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace can win at Manchester United</a> only six days after they lost at newly promoted Sheffield United, and that Newcastle, supposedly in crisis after being turned over by Norwich, can pick themselves up and vanquish Spurs, the Champions League runners up. After all, who wants predictability?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/26/wilfried-bony-newport-west-ham-carabao-cup\">Wilfried Bony helps Newport sharpen their cup claws for West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem \u2013 if it is a problem \u2013 is higher up. Right at the top, in fact, where everything points to another two-horse race involving the same thoroughbreds who galloped clear last season. Yes, these are still very early days, but it already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/anfield-arsenal-liverpool\" title=\"\">feels as though Liverpoo</a>l and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City are once again</a> going to be playing in their own little league, largely because of their own brilliance but also as a result of the inadequacies of others.</p> <p>Indeed, neither club will have got too excited about Spurs struggling to break down Newcastle or Palace strolling through United\u2019s expensively assembled new defence 24 hours earlier.</p> <p>The form of the top two is formidable. Liverpool\u2019s win over Arsenal was their 12th in succession in the Premier League. City have taken 49 points out of the last 51, with the only blot on the copybook being the dramatic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">VAR-dominated 2-2 draw</a> at home against Spurs the weekend before last when the shot count was 30-3 in favour of Pep Guardiola\u2019s team.</p> <p>Uncharacteristically, and much to the annoyance of Fantasy Football fans everywhere, Liverpool and City have been unusually generous in defence this season. Liverpool have conceded in each match and Harry Wilson\u2019s brilliant free-kick for Bournemouth on Sunday means Ederson has already picked the ball out of the net three times for City.</p> <p>That is the good news for the chasing pack, if such a thing exists. The bad news is that Liverpool are averaging three goals per game at the other end of the pitch and City are just above that ratio. Perhaps most sobering is that neither City nor Liverpool have really got into their stride yet.</p> <p>In truth, the key question at the start of this campaign was less about how City and Liverpool would fare and more to do with whether the other members of that established \u201cbig six\u201d could close the cavernous gap that opened up last season when Chelsea, in third place, finished 25 points behind J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s runners up.</p> <p>Reading a lot into a little is a dangerous game and, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Es-RIBnba8\" title=\"\">as Alan Hansen once discovered</a>, August is no time to be writing off anyone\u2019s chances. Equally, it really is hard to see much changing at the top in the near future, especially when Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs have already lost as many games as Liverpool did in the whole of last season.</p>",

Another Opta stat doing the rounds on social media on the weekend, courtesy of Duncan Alexander, revealed that the last time 19 or more teams had three points after three games was in 1981-82, the first season after Jimmy Hill and others had successfully campaigned for the introduction of three points for a win. So, if English football is travelling back in time, what does it mean? The short and simple answer is probably not a lot, other than you can throw a blanket over the majority of the clubs in the Premier League right now, so much so that Newcastle, who enjoyed a terrific win at Tottenham on Sunday, are second from bottom of the table and also one point off fifth. Watford, who are the only team without at least three points and already in danger of being cut adrift after losing their first three fixtures (said tongue-in-cheek, to be clear), travel to St James\u2019 Park on Saturday for a meeting between the bottom two. An early relegation six-pointer. Or, depending on whether your glass of Newcastle Brown Ale is half full or half empty, a chance for Steve Bruce\u2019s side to push for a place in the top six before the international break. That so many clubs are already up and running (there was only one previous occasion when 18 of the 20 Premier League clubs had registered a win at this stage), means the table has an unusually congested feel, even allowing for the fact we are talking about statistics after such a ridiculously small sample of games and at a time of the season when the kids haven\u2019t even gone back to school. On the face of it the current state of play is no bad thing. Leaving aside the football accumulators that are being ruined, there appears to be much to welcome about the idea that Crystal Palace can win at Manchester United only six days after they lost at newly promoted Sheffield United, and that Newcastle, supposedly in crisis after being turned over by Norwich, can pick themselves up and vanquish Spurs, the Champions League runners up. After all, who wants predictability? The problem \u2013 if it is a problem \u2013 is higher up. Right at the top, in fact, where everything points to another two-horse race involving the same thoroughbreds who galloped clear last season. Yes, these are still very early days, but it already feels as though Liverpool and Manchester City are once again going to be playing in their own little league, largely because of their own brilliance but also as a result of the inadequacies of others. Indeed, neither club will have got too excited about Spurs struggling to break down Newcastle or Palace strolling through United\u2019s expensively assembled new defence 24 hours earlier. The form of the top two is formidable. Liverpool\u2019s win over Arsenal was their 12th in succession in the Premier League. City have taken 49 points out of the last 51, with the only blot on the copybook being the dramatic, VAR-dominated 2-2 draw at home against Spurs the weekend before last when the shot count was 30-3 in favour of Pep Guardiola\u2019s team. Uncharacteristically, and much to the annoyance of Fantasy Football fans everywhere, Liverpool and City have been unusually generous in defence this season. Liverpool have conceded in each match and Harry Wilson\u2019s brilliant free-kick for Bournemouth on Sunday means Ederson has already picked the ball out of the net three times for City. That is the good news for the chasing pack, if such a thing exists. The bad news is that Liverpool are averaging three goals per game at the other end of the pitch and City are just above that ratio. Perhaps most sobering is that neither City nor Liverpool have really got into their stride yet. In truth, the key question at the start of this campaign was less about how City and Liverpool would fare and more to do with whether the other members of that established \u201cbig six\u201d could close the cavernous gap that opened up last season when Chelsea, in third place, finished 25 points behind J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s runners up. Reading a lot into a little is a dangerous game and, as Alan Hansen once discovered, August is no time to be writing off anyone\u2019s chances. Equally, it really is hard to see much changing at the top in the near future, especially when Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs have already lost as many games as Liverpool did in the whole of last season.",

With the support of Macron, they directly blamed Bolsonaro for accelerating the clearance of the rainforest by \u201csystematically dismantling\u201d environmental protection agencies, halting the demarcation of indigenous land, and verbally attacking anyone who opposed forest clearance.</p> <p>The declaration urged the G7 to strengthen import restrictions on beef, soy, minerals and other products that originate from areas affected by deforestation, enhance due diligence for investments in the Amazon to ensure they do not violate human rights and environmental controls, and to support Brazil to achieve the Paris climate targets.</p>",

We have to find a compromise between those two.\u201d Pi\u00f1era was speaking before news came that Bolsonaro had endorsed an insulting comment on Facebook about Macron\u2019s wife, Brigitte. Under the umbrella of the G7 summit, a coalition of more than 50 indigenous groups and environmental organisations issued their own statement, adding to the political pressure. With the support of Macron, they directly blamed Bolsonaro for accelerating the clearance of the rainforest by \u201csystematically dismantling\u201d environmental protection agencies, halting the demarcation of indigenous land, and verbally attacking anyone who opposed forest clearance. The declaration urged the G7 to strengthen import restrictions on beef, soy, minerals and other products that originate from areas affected by deforestation, enhance due diligence for investments in the Amazon to ensure they do not violate human rights and environmental controls, and to support Brazil to achieve the Paris climate targets.",

The fastest growing rates of death were in regional areas and among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who died of unintentional overdose at three times the rate of non-Indigenous people. The Penington Institute\u2019s chief executive, John Ryan, said the growth of overdoses in regional areas, particularly heroin-related overdoses in areas where heroin was not previously prevalent, showed that the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d approach was not working. \u201cUnder the law enforcement-focused approach we have seen drug use spread throughout the community and much more potent and dangerous form,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe are seeing more potent drugs and therefore more dangerous drugs becoming increasingly prevalent.

Public support for pill testing has grown after the deaths of a number of young people at music festivals. Those high-profile casualties are a minority of unintentional drug overdoses, which primarily involve men aged 30 to 59. Only one in 10 deaths were among people younger than 30. But Ryan said the pill testing trial at a music festival in the Australian Capital Territory this year, and Victoria\u2019s long-awaited safe injecting room in Richmond, showed that governments were occasionally prepared to take a health-based approach. The Victorian and NSW governments remain opposed to pill testing. More than half of all unintentional drug overdoses in 2017 involved some form of opioid. The number of deaths involving heroin increased by 83.6% since 2013, but opioid-related deaths in regional areas were still more likely to involve another form of opioid, such as oxycodone or codeine. The second most common group of drugs linked to unintentional overdoses was benzodiazepines, followed by stimulants such as methamphetamine or ice. Ryan said governments had fallen behind public expectations in their management of drug issues and deaths should be tackled like the road toll: with a combination of law enforcement and community education campaigns. That would include specific education for people whose family members are at risk of overdose, so they can recognise the signs and not leave a loved one to \u201csleep it off\u201d. \u201cThe simple fact is we\u2019re not dealing with it as a health crisis in the manner that we\u2019ve dealt with the road toll or any other sort of matters,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIf there were this many people dying from other issues we would be throwing energy and resources at it but we\u2019re basically sweeping it under the carpet.\u201d",

In July, a record percentage of all adults were in the labour force (either employed or unemployed) \u2013 more than during the mining boom. The big growth has occurred since the end of 2016, a growth so strong that it took the Reserve Bank by surprise and is a driver of the current low wages growth. The figures also show just how greatly the working life for women has changed over the past 40 years. Since December 2016 the participation rate has risen by 1.5 percentage points to the current record level of 66.1%. That growth is among the fastest two-and-a-half-year rise we have ever experienced \u2013 and certainly comparable with that which occurred during the mining boom. And it means the unemployment rate is higher than it probably would have been, had the participation rate stayed lower. Last month the head of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, suggested that such was the impact of the increased participation that if the participation rate had risen by just 0.75% rather than 1.5%, \u201cthis would have meant the unemployment rate today would have been well below 5%\u201d. Just how low it would be is up for conjecture but if we assume that the increase in people entering the labour force were all unemployed then without those people we would be looking at an unemployment rate of around 4.2% instead of the current 5.2%: Now that is all hypothetical \u2013 people enter the labour force for a number of reasons, not the least of all because there are more jobs. But it does highlight that the employment growth we have had over the past two-and-a-half years would normally have seen unemployment fall by much more than it has. And that has been a big reason for the employment growth not translating to stronger wages growth. But the real interesting thing is what has caused the jump in participation \u2013 it is mostly women in their 30s and people above 60: Women aged 25-39 in December 2016 made up 16% of the entire labour force, and yet they accounted for a quarter of the increase since then. Similarly people aged over 60 made up just 10% of the labour force but they accounted for around another quarter of the increase in the labour force. In effect half of the participation increase has come from a quarter of the labour force. What the figures also show is just how changed the working life has become for women. Women born in the early 1960s largely left the labour from their mid-20s until their early-40s \u2013 the so-called \u201cnappy valley\u201d of participation: By contrast a woman born in 1982 was almost as likely to be in the labour force in her late 20s and 30s as she was in her early 20s. We are now also somewhat astoundingly entering a period where there is no participation valley at all. Millennial women born in the early 1990s are the first generation where the likelihood of them being in the labour market actually increases as they shift from their early to their late-20s: We are also seeing a closing of the participation gap between men and women. It remains wide, but certainly much less than it was for the late baby boomers. By the time they entered their 30s, men born in 1962 had a 30% higher participation rate than women born in that year. By contrast men currently in the early 30s have a participation rate just 16% higher: The closing of the gap is almost all due to the increase in women in the workforce rather than a decline in the number of men working: But while this might suggest that women and men are becoming much more likely to share the responsibilities of raising their children in the pre-school years, when we look at the level of full-time work being performed by women, the nappy valley returns: While the drop in the percentage of women working full-time was not as severe for those born in the 1980s compared to their mothers born 20 years earlier, the reality is when women have children they will not surprisingly be more likely to shift from full-time to part-time. The good news of these figures is that it would appear policy over the past 20 to 30 years to make work more flexible for women with children and to increase the availability and affordability of childcare does look to have had the impact of keeping women working. But the data also highlights that women still face the same struggles that come with being the one who goes part-time \u2013 the drop in superannuation, and the likely losing out on the promotional path and the higher pay that goes with it. The data also highlights that, given there was a big surge in labour for women in their late 30s and for those over 60, the growth areas in the labour force have been in jobs that mostly attract such workers \u2013 the healthcare and the social assistance industry. That industry has been notoriously low-paying, which also means that the employment growth we have experienced was not likely to lead to strong wage growth \u2013 even had the unemployment rate fallen by more than it has. The rise in participation certainly is to be celebrated but somewhat conversely the rise highlights the ongoing issues we have with the labour market \u2013 low wages growth overall and job growth in the lower paying occupations. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "body": "<p>This AFL season has provided many memorable moments \u2013 from Brisbane\u2019s meteoric rise, to Nat Fyfe and Dustin Martin\u2019s return to eminence, via Geelong\u2019s stubborn refusal to lie down and let someone else have a crack.</p> <p>But what of the vanquished? What of the teams who missed the eight, variously promising much, threatening to achieve but in the end leaving fans unfulfilled, unhappy and with no plans for September.</p> <p>What went right for the also-rans, what ultimately went wrong, and what can be done to reverse their fortunes next year?</p> <h2><strong>Hawthorn (ninth)</strong></h2> <p>If we were talking about most clubs, a second failure to reach September in three years \u2013 sandwiched by a straight-sets finals exit in 2018 \u2013 would be cause for concern. But not in Hawthorn\u2019s case. The Hawks were horribly inconsistent this season but arguably no team finished the campaign in better form, with masterful wins over GWS and West Coast a reminder not only of Hawthorn\u2019s class but also the tactical brilliance of their coach, Alastair Clarkson. Now, onto 2020. The return from injury of 2018 Brownlow medallist, Tom Mitchell, speaks for itself, while in-demand Giant Stephen Coniglio will need the mental resolve of a monk to resist Clarkson\u2019s overtures. It\u2019s not often he doesn\u2019t get his man. No doubt Clarkson and his list management team will have a few bunnies in their hats come trade week, a period in which Hawthorn always do outstanding work. The Hawks still have an abundance of experience in their ranks but are also bringing through the greenhorns, James Worpel the shining light amongst them. So bank on them to recruit smartly and return to the finals next season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/26/hawks-afl-tigers-finals-hawthorn-richmond\">With the Hawks in a new phase, the Tigers sense a chance to create an era of their own | Craig Little</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Port Adelaide (10<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>Fans of all clubs listed here endured a season of dwindling fingernails and hair follicles, but none on the scale of Port supporters. At their peak, the Power were able to beat Geelong and West Coast in Perth, but no two weeks were alike. The club drew stinging rebukes for their inability to defeat inferior opponents, the week after beating the cream of the AFL \u2013 which in turn had followed a loss to a team Port were expected to best. And so the cycle continued for a team that knows how to respond, but can\u2019t bring the heat when they only have four points, and not pride, to play for. Port had their injuries, and curious turns at the selection table, but ultimately they have nobody to blame for a wasted campaign but themselves. While doubts persist over their talls and an ageing engine room, young guns such as Connor Rozee and Xavier Duursma ensure a positive outlook. The spotlight, however, must be shone on Ken Hinkley and his coaching staff. Hinkley has the support of the right people, but unless he can turn the Power into a consistent outfit, or at least one capable of playing finals, 2020 looms as the last year of his tenure.</p> <h2><strong>Adelaide (11<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>This season is ample proof that Adelaide\u2019s excuse-riddled descent in 2018 was not down to injuries or mind-bending pre-season camps. The Crows were expected to return to their 2017 best this year, even contend for the flag, but the truth has been laid bare in 2019 and that truth is they are not good enough. That they failed to qualify for September after sitting in fifth spot after round 14 is an indictment on both the players and coaching staff. It seems Don Pyke is safe for now, but given his rigid coaching style and the talent of the list under him, should he be? The last time the Crows missed the finals two years running, it cost Brenton Sanderson his job. An ageing group, the time has come at the Crows for an uncompromising clear out. The club will also have a strong hand at the draft, so if they recruit wisely, eschew boldly and show greater faith in their younger brigade, there is reason to think Adelaide can return to the eight in 2020.</p> <h2><strong>North Melbourne (12<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>See Carlton. Well, not exactly, but there was symmetry in the fortunes of these clubs in 2019. North\u2019s worst this season was wretched, but their best was good enough to rub shoulders with the competition\u2019s best. And it\u2019s no coincidence that the Kangaroos performed at their optimum once Brad Scott vacated the coaching seat and Rhyce Shaw took his place. As was the case with Carlton, the change in leadership seemed to invigorate the playing group. While North\u2019s playing style hasn\u2019t altered markedly under their new coach, Shaw\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not Brad Scott\u201d comment hinted at a shift in mentality. Certainly, Kangaroos players looked a happier bunch as they went about winning seven of their 12 matches under the coach who started on interim terms but became full-time (Shaw was the only person interviewed for the top job). There is much to like about North \u2013 their commitment, spirit and hunger for the contest \u2026 and Ben Brown \u2013 but what they lack is quality across all lines. Fixing that is easier said than done.</p> <h2><strong>Fremantle (13<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>Did the Dockers do the right thing in sacking Ross Lyon? We\u2019ll have to wait until 2020 to find out, but in this case perception looks to be the equal of reality. Put simply, with the tide of opinion out west so violently against him, Lyon could not continue in his role one second longer. Why else would you sack a head coach with one game still to play? The Dockers\u2019 season was essentially one of unfulfilled promise \u2013 they were as high as sixth after round 13 before the rot set in \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom, with triumphs over Greater Western Sydney, Western Bulldogs, Brisbane, Collingwood and Geelong showing that their best is good enough. Nat Fyfe returned to his imperious best in 2019, but, with a stack of experience now out the door, the skipper will need greater assistance from below if Fremantle are to make significant headway under their new coach next season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e441282130a6183124e708d643dcbe00c286ae14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e441282130a6183124e708d643dcbe00c286ae14/0_0_5333_3634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nat Fyfe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nat Fyfe walks off the Adelaide Oval at the weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Brake/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>St Kilda (14<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>The Saints have become dab hands at promising much but delivering very little. It\u2019s now eight seasons since the Saints have marched into September, and worryingly for all concerned the drought doesn\u2019t look like ending any time soon. It wasn\u2019t all bad \u2013 after round five, with a 4-1 record in the bank, St Kilda were second on the ladder \u2013 but as injuries mounted (at one stage, the Saints had 14 players unavailable) and the competition heated up, the Saints were found wanting, prompting Alan Richardson to quit after almost six years in charge. St Kilda battled away manfully under interim coach Brett Ratten, but 14<sup>th</sup> is a true indicator of where they sit. Supporters will hope an exhaustive recruitment process finds the right coach to take the club forward. Just as pressing, however, is a list that is developing young talent \u2013 Hunter Clark, Rowan Marshall and Ben Long can springboard off impressive seasons \u2013 but is still very light on A-listers. Things can change quickly in the AFL, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll change quickly enough for St Kilda in 2020.</p> <h2><strong>Sydney (15<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>It might be more prudent to laud the fact that Sydney played finals for nine straight years, rather than lament their bottom-four finish in 2019. In political parlance, we might look back on this season as the slump Sydney had to have. The Swans gave a nod to the future when bidding farewell to experienced duo Dan Hannebery and Gary Rohan at the end of 2018. And the departures have continued, with Kieren Jack, Jarrad McVeigh, Heath Grundy and Nick Smith \u2013 or in currency terms, 1,000-plus games \u2013 calling time on their careers. The \u2018R\u2019 word won\u2019t be heard at Moore Park but the Swans are now in a rebuild phase, or at least their version of one. But there isn\u2019t a semblance of panic at the Swans. John Longmire\u2019s long-term future has been locked away, and the overwhelming feeling is that both club and coach have a clear view of where they are heading. With the likes of Tom Papley, Isaac Heeney, Oliver Florent, Callum Mills and Nick Blakey fronting the revolution, it\u2019s unlikely the Swans will be staying long in the lower reaches of the ladder.</p> <h2><strong>Carlton (16<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>Scarcely has a club finished 16<sup>th </sup>with such a big grin. Carlton\u2019s season can be divided thus: BT (Before Teague) and PT (Post Teague). The first bit was risible, defined by ex-coach Brendon Bolton\u2019s no-risk, almost apologetic style of football. And the proof was in the pudding. Bolton had won 16 of 77 matches as senior coach, and just one of 11 in 2019 when the board put him and Blues supporters out of their misery in early June. Enter David Teague, who immediately broke the shackles, demanded fluid, high-octane footy \u2013 and achieved results. Now full-time, Teague will enter 2020 with a winning record as senior coach (6-5) but also with rare levels of expectation. Teague has clearly inspired confidence in his players, but they, like their leader, will start the new season officially out of the honeymoon period. It will be a fascinating watch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/the-importance-of-queer-players-in-the-survival-of-womens-australian-football\">The importance of queer players in the survival of women\u2019s Australian football | Emma Race</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Melbourne (17<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>Forget Adelaide or Sydney, Melbourne are the flops of 2019. Preliminary finalists last year, the Dees looked to be the team with most upside and one capable of threatening for ultimate honours. But the reality was nothing like it. Oftentimes Melbourne looked chronically short of confidence and not quite sure what their game plan was, or what they stood for. They had no problems winning the ball \u2013 the Dees ranked top-five for both contested possessions and inside-50s \u2013 but their forward structure was dysfunctional at best. Indeed, it\u2019s an indictment on what appears a capable list that Melbourne were bottom of the pile for efficiency inside-50 and top-four in turnovers. For much of the season it just didn\u2019t look like the Demons could kick a score. Contested-ball king Clayton Oliver had a good season and can hold his head high, but that\u2019s just about it. On the plus side, Melbourne will have an early draft pick but their report card is stamped \u201cMust do better\u201d, and if they don\u2019t do so in 2020, one wonders how long the board\u2019s good will for Simon Goodwin will last.</p> <h2><strong>Gold Coast (18<sup>th</sup>)</strong></h2> <p>After years of sustained mediocrity it\u2019s hard to know what constitutes a pass mark for the Suns in 2019.

      "bodyText": "This AFL season has provided many memorable moments \u2013 from Brisbane\u2019s meteoric rise, to Nat Fyfe and Dustin Martin\u2019s return to eminence, via Geelong\u2019s stubborn refusal to lie down and let someone else have a crack. But what of the vanquished? What of the teams who missed the eight, variously promising much, threatening to achieve but in the end leaving fans unfulfilled, unhappy and with no plans for September. What went right for the also-rans, what ultimately went wrong, and what can be done to reverse their fortunes next year? Hawthorn (ninth) If we were talking about most clubs, a second failure to reach September in three years \u2013 sandwiched by a straight-sets finals exit in 2018 \u2013 would be cause for concern. But not in Hawthorn\u2019s case. The Hawks were horribly inconsistent this season but arguably no team finished the campaign in better form, with masterful wins over GWS and West Coast a reminder not only of Hawthorn\u2019s class but also the tactical brilliance of their coach, Alastair Clarkson. Now, onto 2020. The return from injury of 2018 Brownlow medallist, Tom Mitchell, speaks for itself, while in-demand Giant Stephen Coniglio will need the mental resolve of a monk to resist Clarkson\u2019s overtures. It\u2019s not often he doesn\u2019t get his man. No doubt Clarkson and his list management team will have a few bunnies in their hats come trade week, a period in which Hawthorn always do outstanding work. The Hawks still have an abundance of experience in their ranks but are also bringing through the greenhorns, James Worpel the shining light amongst them. So bank on them to recruit smartly and return to the finals next season. Port Adelaide (10th) Fans of all clubs listed here endured a season of dwindling fingernails and hair follicles, but none on the scale of Port supporters. At their peak, the Power were able to beat Geelong and West Coast in Perth, but no two weeks were alike. The club drew stinging rebukes for their inability to defeat inferior opponents, the week after beating the cream of the AFL \u2013 which in turn had followed a loss to a team Port were expected to best. And so the cycle continued for a team that knows how to respond, but can\u2019t bring the heat when they only have four points, and not pride, to play for. Port had their injuries, and curious turns at the selection table, but ultimately they have nobody to blame for a wasted campaign but themselves. While doubts persist over their talls and an ageing engine room, young guns such as Connor Rozee and Xavier Duursma ensure a positive outlook. The spotlight, however, must be shone on Ken Hinkley and his coaching staff. Hinkley has the support of the right people, but unless he can turn the Power into a consistent outfit, or at least one capable of playing finals, 2020 looms as the last year of his tenure. Adelaide (11th) This season is ample proof that Adelaide\u2019s excuse-riddled descent in 2018 was not down to injuries or mind-bending pre-season camps. The Crows were expected to return to their 2017 best this year, even contend for the flag, but the truth has been laid bare in 2019 and that truth is they are not good enough. That they failed to qualify for September after sitting in fifth spot after round 14 is an indictment on both the players and coaching staff. It seems Don Pyke is safe for now, but given his rigid coaching style and the talent of the list under him, should he be? The last time the Crows missed the finals two years running, it cost Brenton Sanderson his job. An ageing group, the time has come at the Crows for an uncompromising clear out. The club will also have a strong hand at the draft, so if they recruit wisely, eschew boldly and show greater faith in their younger brigade, there is reason to think Adelaide can return to the eight in 2020. North Melbourne (12th) See Carlton. Well, not exactly, but there was symmetry in the fortunes of these clubs in 2019. North\u2019s worst this season was wretched, but their best was good enough to rub shoulders with the competition\u2019s best. And it\u2019s no coincidence that the Kangaroos performed at their optimum once Brad Scott vacated the coaching seat and Rhyce Shaw took his place. As was the case with Carlton, the change in leadership seemed to invigorate the playing group. While North\u2019s playing style hasn\u2019t altered markedly under their new coach, Shaw\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not Brad Scott\u201d comment hinted at a shift in mentality. Certainly, Kangaroos players looked a happier bunch as they went about winning seven of their 12 matches under the coach who started on interim terms but became full-time (Shaw was the only person interviewed for the top job). There is much to like about North \u2013 their commitment, spirit and hunger for the contest \u2026 and Ben Brown \u2013 but what they lack is quality across all lines. Fixing that is easier said than done. Fremantle (13th) Did the Dockers do the right thing in sacking Ross Lyon? We\u2019ll have to wait until 2020 to find out, but in this case perception looks to be the equal of reality. Put simply, with the tide of opinion out west so violently against him, Lyon could not continue in his role one second longer. Why else would you sack a head coach with one game still to play? The Dockers\u2019 season was essentially one of unfulfilled promise \u2013 they were as high as sixth after round 13 before the rot set in \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom, with triumphs over Greater Western Sydney, Western Bulldogs, Brisbane, Collingwood and Geelong showing that their best is good enough. Nat Fyfe returned to his imperious best in 2019, but, with a stack of experience now out the door, the skipper will need greater assistance from below if Fremantle are to make significant headway under their new coach next season. St Kilda (14th) The Saints have become dab hands at promising much but delivering very little. It\u2019s now eight seasons since the Saints have marched into September, and worryingly for all concerned the drought doesn\u2019t look like ending any time soon. It wasn\u2019t all bad \u2013 after round five, with a 4-1 record in the bank, St Kilda were second on the ladder \u2013 but as injuries mounted (at one stage, the Saints had 14 players unavailable) and the competition heated up, the Saints were found wanting, prompting Alan Richardson to quit after almost six years in charge. St Kilda battled away manfully under interim coach Brett Ratten, but 14th is a true indicator of where they sit. Supporters will hope an exhaustive recruitment process finds the right coach to take the club forward. Just as pressing, however, is a list that is developing young talent \u2013 Hunter Clark, Rowan Marshall and Ben Long can springboard off impressive seasons \u2013 but is still very light on A-listers. Things can change quickly in the AFL, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll change quickly enough for St Kilda in 2020. Sydney (15th) It might be more prudent to laud the fact that Sydney played finals for nine straight years, rather than lament their bottom-four finish in 2019. In political parlance, we might look back on this season as the slump Sydney had to have. The Swans gave a nod to the future when bidding farewell to experienced duo Dan Hannebery and Gary Rohan at the end of 2018. And the departures have continued, with Kieren Jack, Jarrad McVeigh, Heath Grundy and Nick Smith \u2013 or in currency terms, 1,000-plus games \u2013 calling time on their careers. The \u2018R\u2019 word won\u2019t be heard at Moore Park but the Swans are now in a rebuild phase, or at least their version of one. But there isn\u2019t a semblance of panic at the Swans. John Longmire\u2019s long-term future has been locked away, and the overwhelming feeling is that both club and coach have a clear view of where they are heading. With the likes of Tom Papley, Isaac Heeney, Oliver Florent, Callum Mills and Nick Blakey fronting the revolution, it\u2019s unlikely the Swans will be staying long in the lower reaches of the ladder. Carlton (16th) Scarcely has a club finished 16th with such a big grin. Carlton\u2019s season can be divided thus: BT (Before Teague) and PT (Post Teague). The first bit was risible, defined by ex-coach Brendon Bolton\u2019s no-risk, almost apologetic style of football. And the proof was in the pudding. Bolton had won 16 of 77 matches as senior coach, and just one of 11 in 2019 when the board put him and Blues supporters out of their misery in early June. Enter David Teague, who immediately broke the shackles, demanded fluid, high-octane footy \u2013 and achieved results. Now full-time, Teague will enter 2020 with a winning record as senior coach (6-5) but also with rare levels of expectation. Teague has clearly inspired confidence in his players, but they, like their leader, will start the new season officially out of the honeymoon period. It will be a fascinating watch. Melbourne (17th) Forget Adelaide or Sydney, Melbourne are the flops of 2019. Preliminary finalists last year, the Dees looked to be the team with most upside and one capable of threatening for ultimate honours. But the reality was nothing like it. Oftentimes Melbourne looked chronically short of confidence and not quite sure what their game plan was, or what they stood for. They had no problems winning the ball \u2013 the Dees ranked top-five for both contested possessions and inside-50s \u2013 but their forward structure was dysfunctional at best. Indeed, it\u2019s an indictment on what appears a capable list that Melbourne were bottom of the pile for efficiency inside-50 and top-four in turnovers. For much of the season it just didn\u2019t look like the Demons could kick a score. Contested-ball king Clayton Oliver had a good season and can hold his head high, but that\u2019s just about it. On the plus side, Melbourne will have an early draft pick but their report card is stamped \u201cMust do better\u201d, and if they don\u2019t do so in 2020, one wonders how long the board\u2019s good will for Simon Goodwin will last. Gold Coast (18th) After years of sustained mediocrity it\u2019s hard to know what constitutes a pass mark for the Suns in 2019. However, a second wooden spoon and 19 consecutive defeats to close out the season isn\u2019t it. Gold Coast\u2019s 3-1 start to the year was the falsest of false dawns, a mirage that disguised a unit stripped of quality \u2013 think Lynch and May \u2013 and fielding the youngest, least-experienced list in the AFL. The Suns will again be key players at the national draft, where they will have the No 1 pick for the first time since 2010 \u2013 and, possibly, a priority pick if the AFL yields to the club\u2019s request. Gold Coast will need to choose wisely, and hope for instant results, for while Stuart Dew has the backing of his paymasters and is talking a positive game, nothing is guaranteed in this results-driven business.",

The Independent Commission Against Corruption is currently investigating a potentially unlawful donations scheme that may have helped to hide a $100,000 donation to Labor from Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire barred from donating in New South Wales due to his links to property development. The inquiry heard Huang arrived at Labor\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters with $100,000 in an Aldi shopping bag, which he gave to NSW Labor boss, Jamie Clements, in early April 2015. Icac is examining whether \u201cstraw donors\u201d, or fake donors, were used to hide the true origin of Huang\u2019s $100,000 cash donation.

      "bodyText": "A first-of-its-kind study of racism in Australian schools has found one in three students report being the victim of racial discrimination by their peers. Researchers from the Australian National University and Western Sydney University surveyed 4,600 primary and secondary students at government schools in New South Wales and Victoria on their experiences of racial discrimination in schools. The study found that 40% of students in years five to nine from non-Anglo or European backgrounds reported experiencing racial discrimination by their peers. Close to 20% of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background reported experiences of racial discrimination from their teachers. One in three students from non-Anglo or European backgrounds reported experiences of racial discrimination in wider society. The report\u2019s lead author, ANU associate professor Naomi Priest, said the survey offered a first-of-its-kind data point for the prevalence of racism in Australian schools. \u201cI think Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and ethnic minority communities have been telling us for a long time that racism is part of their everyday lived experience,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat this survey gives us is some data on how common that is, and the burden it places on children and young people. We know racism and race discrimination are major issues and of course they effect children.\u201d The survey found that 78% of students said they were able to make friends with peers from a different ethnic background, and most students surveyed said they would feel comfortable intervening if they saw a peer suffering racial abuse. While Priest said racial discrimination was \u201ca reflection of wider society\u201d she said its presence in schools could have impacts on student achievement and development. Earlier this month, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a policy paper on the role of racism in child and adolescent health which called it a \u201ccore social determinant of health\u201d and \u201ca driver of health inequities\u201d. Other findings have established that \u201cthe emotional pain created by experiences of racism look very similar to the patterns of brain activity caused by physical pain\u201d. \u201cSchools are microcosms of the wider society and of course there are structural issues,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThis is only one way of capturing and measuring racism \u2013 there are incarceration rates, treatment in the healthcare system, policing, but these interpersonal things also impacts on things such a child\u2019s mental health.\u201d The survey was made up 55% of students who identified as of Anglo-Celtic or European background (55%); 22% from south, east or southeast Asian; 5% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island, 5% Middle Eastern; 4% Pacific Islander and 3% African. Those from non-Anglo backgrounds were twice as likely to report experiencing racial discrimination than those from Anglo backgrounds. Researchers asked students whether they had been insulted or called names, been left out of activities, been threatened, spit at, hit or violently attacked as a result of their race or ethnicity. East Asian students reported the highest rate of insults or name calling on the basis of their background at 44%, while 30% of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island students surveyed reported having students spit, push or hit them on the basis of their race. Among Anglo-Celtic students 15% said they had been insulted on the basis of their background, while 6% reported being subject to violence. The report was compiled as part of the Speak Out Against Racism program, which is developing a program to encourage students and staff to address racism in schools. \u201cWe need high-quality, whole-of-school programs \u2013 built on evidence and which are tested \u2013 that act to directly prevent and appropriately respond to racial discrimination and racism when it happens,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThis is the aim of the second phase our work in SOAR \u2013 to develop and trial a bystander program that encourages students and staff to prevent and address racism and racial bullying.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This isn\u2019t a great week to be Tim Paine. Australia\u2019s Test captain has always been vulnerable to criticism: given he first took over the team in caretaker mode, it\u2019s an easy move to question his legitimacy. Double down with the fact he was initially picked as almost a specialist wicketkeeper, with his batting closer to useful than dominant. These shots are cheap, but it was only ever going to take a bad loss or a couple of low scores before people took them.</p> <p>Anyone\u2019s captaincy will fairly come under scrutiny when a team concedes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/tim-paine-australia-england-ashes\" title=\"\">fourth-innings chase of well over 300</a> or after a hefty last-wicket partnership. The same goes for bowling out an opponent for 67 and still losing. You can question Paine\u2019s tactics of putting the field back for Ben Stokes so early and you can question his use of reviews after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/26/australias-use-of-drs-must-improve-after-costly-headingley-defeat-admits-langer\" title=\"\">a late, incorrect referral</a> when Pat Cummins hit Jack Leach on the pad. But knowing what didn\u2019t work is, of course, the province of hindsight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/26/ben-stokes-england-ashes-australia-drs-asterisk\">Ben Stokes\u2019s rampage should not be sullied with a judgmental asterisk | Rob Smyth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One obvious incongruity after Stokes\u2019s miracle was seeing Steve Smith in training kit lining up with the support staff to shake a long line of English hands. Smith\u2019s batting had not been hugely missed, with Marnus Labuschagne making 74 and 80 in his place; Smith the former captain might have been an asset on the field in those frenetic final overs as Stokes cleared the boundary again and again.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not a foregone conclusion. It\u2019s not like Smith the captain was an ice-cold decision-maker: he stressed and fretted, and had defensive impulses, and lacked the personal charisma to rally a group by voice rather than by batting deed. Eight men on the fence may well have been his plan and it may not have been in his power to rein in bowlers losing their heads.</p> <p>Paine\u2019s leadership was evident in other ways. Even as Stokes was mid-shot hitting the winning boundary Nathan Lyon collapsed to the ground at backward point.

      "bodyText": "This isn\u2019t a great week to be Tim Paine. Australia\u2019s Test captain has always been vulnerable to criticism: given he first took over the team in caretaker mode, it\u2019s an easy move to question his legitimacy. Double down with the fact he was initially picked as almost a specialist wicketkeeper, with his batting closer to useful than dominant. These shots are cheap, but it was only ever going to take a bad loss or a couple of low scores before people took them. Anyone\u2019s captaincy will fairly come under scrutiny when a team concedes a fourth-innings chase of well over 300 or after a hefty last-wicket partnership. The same goes for bowling out an opponent for 67 and still losing. You can question Paine\u2019s tactics of putting the field back for Ben Stokes so early and you can question his use of reviews after a late, incorrect referral when Pat Cummins hit Jack Leach on the pad. But knowing what didn\u2019t work is, of course, the province of hindsight. One obvious incongruity after Stokes\u2019s miracle was seeing Steve Smith in training kit lining up with the support staff to shake a long line of English hands. Smith\u2019s batting had not been hugely missed, with Marnus Labuschagne making 74 and 80 in his place; Smith the former captain might have been an asset on the field in those frenetic final overs as Stokes cleared the boundary again and again. But that\u2019s not a foregone conclusion. It\u2019s not like Smith the captain was an ice-cold decision-maker: he stressed and fretted, and had defensive impulses, and lacked the personal charisma to rally a group by voice rather than by batting deed. Eight men on the fence may well have been his plan and it may not have been in his power to rein in bowlers losing their heads. Paine\u2019s leadership was evident in other ways. Even as Stokes was mid-shot hitting the winning boundary Nathan Lyon collapsed to the ground at backward point. He had fumbled a chance to run out Leach in the previous over, then had a leg-before appeal against Stokes turned down that the HawkEye computer would have upheld, but Australia\u2019s last review had been spent. As soon as Paine noticed his spinner on the deck he walked over to help him up. \u201cHe\u2019s a really important player in our side. I said to him that if our players see him dealing with it really quickly and moving on then our younger players are going to do the same thing, and we turn up to Manchester or our next training session in a much better frame of mind.\u201d It was one instance of an impressive level-headedness. Rather than scratch at the review or the run-out or the catch that Marcus Harris dropped, he looked more broadly, especially to the third innings. \u201cWe could have batted them right out of the game. When you keep giving a team with high-quality players a sniff, whether it\u2019s a Jofra [Archer] with the ball or Stokes with the bat or Root with the bat, they\u2019re going to make you pay \u2013 we probably missed a slight opportunity to bat them right out of the game and get 450 in front.\u201d Of course, the drama of those closing moments will always pull focus to the last few turning points. So it\u2019s worth mentioning the logical fallacy that Paine\u2019s wrong DRS review meant that Lyon\u2019s dismissal was lost. If the Cummins review had not been sent upstairs, then the next ball would have been bowled a couple of minutes earlier. The entire next over would have been slightly different, both for bowler and batsman. In short, Lyon\u2019s ball to Stokes can only exist in a world where Paine has already taken the review. If Paine doesn\u2019t review, a different ball is bowled, with an unknown result. Something else happens, and one of the teams wins. You can\u2019t unscramble the omelette of a cause-and-effect timeline. So that just leaves the not-out decision by umpire Joel Wilson. He is being roasted in the Australian media, but after a poor game at Edgbaston he actually bounced back in the third Test with a series of excellent decisions and a 7-1 record against the review system. The contention that he made a blatant mistake is not fair. Replays suggest HawkEye was questionable, tracking a change of direction after the ball flicked the front pad.

McHugh joined the little flotilla that sped to the scene. \u201cWe did what we could \u2013 took the casualties from the water, brought them ashore. We were in total shock, we just reacted. You go on autopilot and keep on going.\u201d Irish security forces, British police, royal family representatives and the world\u2019s press descended, turning the Pier Head hotel into an operations centre. They left but grief and an \u201cair of gloom\u201d stayed for many years, said McHugh. One symptom was the fall in the number of Protestant holidaymakers from Northern Ireland, he said. \u201cThings never went back to normal.\u201d Charles, the Prince of Wales, helped draw a line under the atrocity during a poignant visit with the Duchess of Cornwall and Timothy Knatchbull in 2015. The prince spoke of reconciliation and called Mountbatten the grandfather he never had. \u201cThat was a huge moment in the healing history of these islands,\u201d said Fr McHugh. \u201cThat fact that he came showed things had moved on.\u201d Four years later Mullaghmore knows there is no fully escaping history. In the run-up to the anniversary a BBC TV documentary included gut-wrenching testimony from relatives of the victims, plus a claim from a former IRA member that Martin McGuinness, the late Sinn F\u00e9in leader, was the IRA commander who gave the green light. The Mail on Sunday reported a separate claim that an SAS hit squad tracked down and killed Francis McGirl, one of the alleged bombers, in 1995 and made it resemble an accident. Netflix is likely to shine a fresh spotlight on Mullaghmore in the third series of The Crown which launches in November and brings the story of the royal family into the 1970s. Charles Dance reportedly plays Mountbatten. Tourists enjoying sun and ice-cream by the harbour last week said they were aware of what unfolded there in 1979. \u201cIt\u2019s still shocking. It makes you feel very sad,\u201d said Peter Torney, 52, from Omagh, a Co Tyrone town that suffered its own devastating bombing. \u201cWhat happened here was stupidity,\u201d said his wife, Michelle, 53. \u201cIt was like everything that happened over the years \u2013 shouldn\u2019t have happened, end of.\u201d There are three physical memorials: a small cross on a hillside, a bench in a peace garden and a plaque in the grounds of Classiebawn Castle. The property passed to different owners but the gates still have the Mountbatten initials. It is right to remember Mountbatten and his companions, said McGowan, the historian. He has written about them on his blog. But there is inequality in death, he said. Margaret Perry, a young woman murdered and buried in Mullaghmore in 1992, is a forgotten victim of the Troubles, he said. \u201cWho comes for her anniversary? Do you need a title to be remembered?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Capital controls imposed on depositors at the height of Greece\u2019s debt crisis are being lifted after four years. The policy change will finally remove restrictions on companies and individuals sending money abroad, which were introduced to prevent bank runs during the 2015 Grexit crisis. Signalling a new era for the country at the centre of the turmoil that engulfed the eurozone for almost a decade, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, on Monday declared the financial restrictions \u201ca thing of the past\u201d. Addressing the Greek parliament barely seven weeks after his centre-right government assumed power, he described the dismantling of the banking measures as the end of \u201ca four-year cycle of insecurity\u201d. \u201cAfter 50 whole months they are being abolished,\u201d he told MPs. With controls fully lifted, companies and savers will be able to make transfers abroad from 1 September. Mitsotakis\u2019s new pro-business administration, which sees domestic and foreign investment as key to economic recovery, said restoration of the free movement of capital will help restore confidence in Greece. Fears of a disorderly exit in mid-2015 prompted panicked depositors to make mass cash withdrawals while the leftist government led by Alexis Tsipras hammered out the terms of emergency funding from the EU and IMF. Mitsotakis, a former banker himself, had long described lifting of the controls as a priority for the country\u2019s return to normality. Although gradually eased in recent years, the remaining restrictions had been interpreted as an impediment to the revival of an economy that had been bailed out three times since 2010.",

Justin Trudeau\u2019s popularity has plummeted as he\u2019s been caught up in a corruption scandal \u2013 something even his jaunty socks have yet to mitigate \u2013 while Emmanuel Macron has had to face gilets jaunes protests for the best part of a year. But what helps one through difficult times? Strong relationships. True love. I\u2019ve never seen a photograph that looks more like a screengrab of two actors coming out on YouTube: finishing each other\u2019s sentences as they open up about how they first set eyes on each other, disappointing legions of teen girls. The comments underneath the video are split evenly between well-wishers, devastated-cry-face emojis and angry religious types making typos on the word disgusting. SO many happy couples! High temperatures and blazing sun! Is this the G7 summit or an episode of Love Island??!! Well, not exactly Love Island: that\u2019s a show taking place in a world where everyone is straight and politics don\u2019t exist and contestants complain about their privacy being invaded despite literally going on a TV show, the whole point of which is to lay bare their love lives \u2013 and their bodies. The socks. Here we have the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, presumably thinking the same thing we are: that the G7 logo is crap and looks like a medal ribbon \u2013 but for a medal that is handed out just for taking part. At a school sports day, say. No idea about the font, except to say it almost certainly came pre-packaged with Windows 95. This looks like the start of a television quiz show in which the contestants are forced to crane their necks upwards for a dramatic opening shot that the producer still considers to be actual genius. Speaking of genius \u2013 there are quite a few shots in the G7 photo-sets which are closeups of shoes. Just shoes. GUY BOURDIN LIVES! I\u2019m not sure I have ever seen a more terrifying picture: Donald Trump looks like Freddy Krueger crawling into your nightmares, while also crawling out of the television on which you are watching Freddy Krueger. Trump is a nightmare on every street. This appears to be Trump kissing Merkel on the nose and I just don\u2019t want to dwell on that any further. It\u2019s nice of them here to arrange themselves in height order, as if they were at the front of a queue for a rollercoaster and the attendants is deciding on who is allowed on the front row before fastening the strap in a way that makes you fear for your life. The guy on the far right is cheating, however, because of his huge hat, which is not subtle. He\u2019s also the guy who would turn up to an Oxford open day in a suit. I\u2019m telling you, as with Justin \u2019n\u2019 Emmanuel, this is happening. You heard it here first. And then on the cover of W magazine. And I\u2019ll leave you with this, which is Macron cosplaying as a Bond villain. But even with Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s immense talent on board, I doubt even she will be able to come up with the kind of egotistical, maniacal malefactors to compete with the lot who currently rule the world. \u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "It may placate those offended by the largesse of a golfer scooping $15m for tournament success to hear that the value of that prize doesn\u2019t matter to the individual in question. When seeking to close out the Tour Championship, with the associated FedEx Cup bounty the standard reference point, Rory McIlroy\u2019s focus was solely on professional entities. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it once,\u201d McIlroy insisted of the biggest pay day in golf\u2019s history. \u201cI was thinking about winning this tournament, winning the stroke average, getting back to second in the world. All those things are way more important to me. I realise I\u2019m in a very privileged position that I can say that but at this stage in my career they are way more important to me.\u201d Success at East Lake did, however, mean McIlroy could alter the life of someone close to him. The golfer\u2019s best friend and caddie, Harry Diamond, will collect $1.5m in line with typical percentages bestowed on a bag man. This alliance, however, stretches beyond clubs and yardages. \u201cHarry would be happy with anything,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cIt\u2019s just so cool to be able to do this with him, aside from money or anything else. We are sharing these experiences; we watched Tiger win at East Lake a year ago and now we walk up to the last green and have that moment. That stuff is so cool and will stay with us forever. It\u2019s worth way more than cheques.\u201d The scoring average to which McIlroy referred has closed at under 70 and is the best in this PGA Tour season, earning him the Vardon Trophy. Having also won the Players Championship and Canadian Open, McIlroy has a case to challenge Brooks Koepka as the player of the year. From 19 PGA Tour starts in 2019, McIlroy notched 14 top 10s. Consistency of performance is linked to a stable state of mind. \u201cSometimes emotion has worked against me, and that\u2019s the real reason that I maybe don\u2019t show as much out there as I used to,\u201d said the four-times major winner. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get too high and I don\u2019t want to get too low. \u201cIf I needed to get emotional and get really riled up, this isn\u2019t the sport to do that. I\u2019m not a football player. It\u2019s golf, and you sort of need to try to be pretty even-keeled the whole way through.\u201d McIlroy, who now has only Koepka ahead of him in the world rankings, has scaled back matters of technicality. \u201cI made a plan at the start of the year not to really focus or worry about my swing the weeks that I\u2019m playing,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to do all of my work with my coach Michael Bannon on off weeks. I think you should do your work before the tournament starts, and then once you\u2019re there, just go with what you have.\u201d Lessons learned 11 months ago, when McIlroy was beaten to the Tour Championship by Tiger Woods, have also proved pivotal. \u201cI had played in another final group and didn\u2019t get the job done,\u201d McIlroy recalled. \u201cI said to myself that I had to make a few changes. I started to approach things differently.\u201d A key example: stop treating Sundays like any other tournament round. \u201cYou have to be a realist and realise it\u2019s not,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cYou have to prepare for it. Brooks went out there on Sunday in Memphis [at the World Golf Championship in July], shot 65 and just basically dominated the tournament, dominated me. I realised if I want to become the dominant player in the world again, I need to be more like that.\u201d It was on day one at this year\u2019s Open that we saw McIlroy stumble. His 79 in front of a stunned audience in his native Northern Ireland proved fatal to his chances of surviving for the weekend. When assessing McIlroy\u2019s year, this looks the clear outlier. \u201cIt is and it isn\u2019t; the first round is but I shot six under on the second day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the golf was in there but I had a horrific start. It was a bit of an anomaly, I feel. \u201cPeople put their own importance on certain things, it\u2019s all perception. The majors are very important to me, they are the biggest tournaments in the world and you want to win them but at the same time there are four chances a year. It\u2019s not as if you don\u2019t win them then there is nothing left to play for. It [success] is not guaranteed, there\u2019s a law of averages.\u201d",

Hosting the event at Doral, an 800-acre golf resort close to the Miami airport, would divert a torrent of taxpayer cash into Trump\u2019s own coffers.</p> \n<p>But Trump said he had been losing money as president.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent, and I think I will, in a combination of loss and opportunity, probably it will cost me anywhere from $3bn to $5bn to be president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd the only thing I care about is this country.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I used to make a lot of money to give speeches.

Zippo.\u201d</p> \n<p>As a number apparently without basis in any vet-able balance sheet, the \u201c$3bn to $5bn\u201d figure was beyond factchecking. But it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fahrenthold/status/1166012062637727744\">appeared to be based</a> on a separate false estimation by Trump that exaggerated the size of his eponymous company by about 15 times.</p> \n<p>Trump proceeded to dump on the assembled press a real estate brochure\u2019s worth of stats and facts about his Doral property.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoral happens to be ... only five minutes from the airport, the airport\u2019s right next door,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, my people looked at 12 sites, all good, but some were two hours from the airport, some four hours.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 rooms, they have magnificent views. And what we have also is Miami.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president went on to extol the abundance of parking at his resort, where net operating income has fallen by 69% in the last two years, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-sings-the-praises-of-his-resort-in-florida-as-g-7-host-for-2020/2019/08/26/17409c1e-c7ea-11e9-8067-196d9f17af68_story.html\">reported</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida, and the best,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEach country can have their own villa, or their own bungalow, and the bungalows like I say have a lot of units in them.\u201d</p> \n<p>He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to make money. I don\u2019t care about making money \u2026 It\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about getting the right location.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later, when asked about the new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, Trump said \u201cI love the UK\u201d and listed his golf properties there, naming Turnberry and Aberdeen. But he also mentioned Doonbeg, which is in the Republic of Ireland.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s business ties, which he has not fully disclosed to voters, have raised concerns that he could have violated a constitutional ban on government officials taking emoluments \u2013 profits derived from the holding of public office \u2013 from foreign governments or actors.</p> \n<p>His continued ownership of the Trump Organization means, for example, that an untold share of the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-25/trump-s-company-reports-profit-rose-from-foreign-governments\">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> spent by foreign governments and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/18/trump-international-hotel-dc-guests-lobbyists-republicans-executives\">tens of millions of dollars</a> spent by domestic interest groups at the Trump International hotel in Washington could have found their way to Trump himself.</p> \n<p>The Trump Organization claims to reimburse the US treasury where appropriate.</p> \n<p>Trump-branded properties have had mixed success since Trump moved into the White House. A flood of foreign leaders, security spending and staff could stop that skid.</p> \n<p>The US last hosted the G7 summit (then the G8 with the inclusion of Russia, which was expelled in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/25/g7-trumps-demands-for-russias-readmission-causes-row-in-biarritz\">which Trump now wants to readmit</a>) in 2012 at Camp David, Maryland, a government site.

      "bodyText": "Defending himself against accusations of seeking to profit off the presidency by planning to host a G7 summit next year at one of his resorts, Donald Trump on Monday estimated that being president had cost him $3bn to $5bn and said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to make money. I don\u2019t care about making money.\u201d Trump took questions from reporters in a joint appearance with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the conclusion of the G7 summit in Biarritz. The US is slated to host the summit next year. The US president confirmed for the first time that his struggling Trump National Doral Miami resort in Florida is high in the running to host the event. Hosting the G7 will cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Hosting the event at Doral, an 800-acre golf resort close to the Miami airport, would divert a torrent of taxpayer cash into Trump\u2019s own coffers. But Trump said he had been losing money as president. \u201cI\u2019ve spent, and I think I will, in a combination of loss and opportunity, probably it will cost me anywhere from $3bn to $5bn to be president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd the only thing I care about is this country. \u201cPeople have asked me, \u2018What do you think it costs\u2019\u201d to be president, he said. \u201cI used to make a lot of money to give speeches. Now I give speeches all the time, and what do I get? Zippo.\u201d As a number apparently without basis in any vet-able balance sheet, the \u201c$3bn to $5bn\u201d figure was beyond factchecking. But it appeared to be based on a separate false estimation by Trump that exaggerated the size of his eponymous company by about 15 times. Trump proceeded to dump on the assembled press a real estate brochure\u2019s worth of stats and facts about his Doral property. \u201cDoral happens to be ... only five minutes from the airport, the airport\u2019s right next door,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, my people looked at 12 sites, all good, but some were two hours from the airport, some four hours. \u201cWe have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 rooms, they have magnificent views. And what we have also is Miami.\u201d The president went on to extol the abundance of parking at his resort, where net operating income has fallen by 69% in the last two years, the Washington Post reported. \u201cThe ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida, and the best,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEach country can have their own villa, or their own bungalow, and the bungalows like I say have a lot of units in them.\u201d He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to make money. I don\u2019t care about making money \u2026 It\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about getting the right location.\u201d Later, when asked about the new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, Trump said \u201cI love the UK\u201d and listed his golf properties there, naming Turnberry and Aberdeen. But he also mentioned Doonbeg, which is in the Republic of Ireland. Trump\u2019s business ties, which he has not fully disclosed to voters, have raised concerns that he could have violated a constitutional ban on government officials taking emoluments \u2013 profits derived from the holding of public office \u2013 from foreign governments or actors. His continued ownership of the Trump Organization means, for example, that an untold share of the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent by foreign governments and tens of millions of dollars spent by domestic interest groups at the Trump International hotel in Washington could have found their way to Trump himself. The Trump Organization claims to reimburse the US treasury where appropriate. Trump-branded properties have had mixed success since Trump moved into the White House. A flood of foreign leaders, security spending and staff could stop that skid. The US last hosted the G7 summit (then the G8 with the inclusion of Russia, which was expelled in 2014 and which Trump now wants to readmit) in 2012 at Camp David, Maryland, a government site. In 2004, the US hosted at Sea Island, Georgia.",

      "bodyText": "An 18-year-old woman has died from a suspected drug overdose in Leeds, the second such death in the city over the bank holiday weekend. West Yorkshire police said the teenager was taken to hospital after collapsing at the Warehouse club in the city centre in the early hours of Monday. Officers were notified by Leeds General Infirmary at 3.18am and she died a short time later, the force said. A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and remained in police custody on Monday. DI Amanda Wimbles of Leeds CID said: \u201cTaking illegal substances is incredibly dangerous and I would urge anyone considering doing so to think twice before doing so. We are supporting the family of the deceased.\u201d The death comes just 48 hours after a 17-year-old girl died from a suspected drug overdose at Leeds festival, where potentially lethal ecstasy pills were being sold. Police said the teenager, from Oldham, had taken \u201ca combination of drugs\u201d and died at the Bramham Park site shortly after 3.40am on Saturday. Following her death, a 17-year-old boy from the Oldham area was arrested on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs and later released under investigation. The deaths will increase concerns about the rising strength, purity and widespread availability of so-called party drugs. Police had issued a warning about \u201cvery dangerous, high strength\u201d pills called Donkey Kong, Trump and Skype that were in circulation at Leeds festival, which officers said contained \u201cup to three times the normal average adult dose\u201d. The organisers of the Creamfields dance music festival issued a similar warning on Sunday, saying extremely potent MDMA tablets were being taken on-site, where Calvin Harris and the Chemical Brothers were headlining. Experts have called for increased testing at festivals after research found that many drugs contained other harmful ingredients, such as an MDMA pill that was actually n-ethylpentylone, a long-lasting cathinone that can cause anxiety, paranoia, insomnia and psychosis.",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/\">Whitworth Art Gallery </a>exists for \u201cthe perpetual gratification of the people of Manchester\u201d, in the words of its Victorian founder, and in that spirit it has one of the most democratic approaches in the country to its collection of prints and drawings. Anyone can make an appointment to explore its boxes of works by the likes of Turner and Blake. Its new exhibition C\u00e9zanne at the Whitworth celebrates that collection, and a remarkable gift to it that proves the spirit of Victorian philanthropy is alive.</p> <p>The story starts with a radical masterpiece the Whitworth bought in 1927 when many Britons would have regarded it as a worthless scrap of paper. Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Study of Trees still challenges today. Black strands like fluttering seaweed mark the tracks of thin, twisting branches in empty space while watery touches of olive and orange hint at foliage. The art of summer is usually imagined as a sensual picnic beside a sun-kissed sea \u2013 Luxe, Calme et Volupt\u00e9, \u201cluxury, peace and voluptuousness\u201d, as Matisse, quoting Baudelaire, called an ecstatic nude beach scene. There\u2019s a romp of a drawing by Picasso in the Whitworth\u2019s show that delivers that Riviera vibe, and then some. Two women are bathing naked in an abundance of curvy lines that communicates the artist\u2019s greedy delight in their bodies. But this gleefully erotic Mediterranean scene just underlines that where Picasso leaps in, C\u00e9zanne holds back, staring, thinking, and alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6f4f86dc92cdd4e0b8054b47841f4c087a84084\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f4f86dc92cdd4e0b8054b47841f4c087a84084/0_69_2337_1402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"detail from Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Study of Trees: La Lisiere (c1895)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Challenging ... detail from Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Study of Trees: La Lisiere (c1895).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Whitworth Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there\u2019s a melancholy undertow to this exhibition, that is appropriate, for it commemorates the generosity of art dealer Karsten Schubert who died in July. Before his death at the age of 57 from cancer, Schubert gifted the Whitworth his collection of works on paper by C\u00e9zanne.</p> <p>These are true treasures. Subtle masterpieces of drawing and printmaking, they pack more thought and feeling into the merest sketch than most artists have ever been able to communicate in a massive installation. C\u00e9zanne once claimed his contemporary Monet was \u201conly an eye\u201d. No one could say that of the drawings here. C\u00e9zanne is never just eye but a complex brain, and an even more complex soul. Everything he ever drew is a silent, still explosion of insight and passion. Two drawings given by Schubert portray C\u00e9zanne\u2019s young son, Paul junior: in a little sketch on blue paper he watches Paul sleep and all the tenderness, anxiety and hopes of parenthood seem to fill each pencil mark.</p> <p>That intensity and clarity transfigures a drawing of a skull that C\u00e9zanne made in the 1890s into a shattering modern <em>memento mori</em>. Skulls and skeletons were an artistic cliche by the late 19th century. Even Van Gogh lapses into morbid tomfoolery in his 1886 painting of a skeleton smoking a cigarette. But C\u00e9zanne sees it as planes of shade and shadow. Flat blocks of pencil work create the solidity of its cranium and the pools of its vacant eye sockets. It is a dazzling still life study \u2013 an intensely fresh act of observation. By seeing it like this he frees the skull of hokey symbolism. Paradoxically, that lets the reality of death hit us afresh. </p> <p>About 20 years before he drew that proto-Cubist skull, C\u00e9zanne etched his 1873 print <a href=\"https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/122595/\">Armand Guillaumin with the Hanged Man</a>. This image of a fellow artist haunted by an executed corpse in the background is typical of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s romantic obsession with death and crime \u2013 the dark side of himself that he conquers in his study of a skull only to make its mortal menace more real. C\u00e9zanne turned symbols into things, and things into art. In the process he invented modernism. His art is electrifyingly tense because the transformations his pencil creates are never easy.

      "bodyText": "The Whitworth Art Gallery exists for \u201cthe perpetual gratification of the people of Manchester\u201d, in the words of its Victorian founder, and in that spirit it has one of the most democratic approaches in the country to its collection of prints and drawings. Anyone can make an appointment to explore its boxes of works by the likes of Turner and Blake. Its new exhibition C\u00e9zanne at the Whitworth celebrates that collection, and a remarkable gift to it that proves the spirit of Victorian philanthropy is alive. The story starts with a radical masterpiece the Whitworth bought in 1927 when many Britons would have regarded it as a worthless scrap of paper. Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Study of Trees still challenges today. Black strands like fluttering seaweed mark the tracks of thin, twisting branches in empty space while watery touches of olive and orange hint at foliage. The art of summer is usually imagined as a sensual picnic beside a sun-kissed sea \u2013 Luxe, Calme et Volupt\u00e9, \u201cluxury, peace and voluptuousness\u201d, as Matisse, quoting Baudelaire, called an ecstatic nude beach scene. There\u2019s a romp of a drawing by Picasso in the Whitworth\u2019s show that delivers that Riviera vibe, and then some. Two women are bathing naked in an abundance of curvy lines that communicates the artist\u2019s greedy delight in their bodies. But this gleefully erotic Mediterranean scene just underlines that where Picasso leaps in, C\u00e9zanne holds back, staring, thinking, and alone. If there\u2019s a melancholy undertow to this exhibition, that is appropriate, for it commemorates the generosity of art dealer Karsten Schubert who died in July. Before his death at the age of 57 from cancer, Schubert gifted the Whitworth his collection of works on paper by C\u00e9zanne. These are true treasures. Subtle masterpieces of drawing and printmaking, they pack more thought and feeling into the merest sketch than most artists have ever been able to communicate in a massive installation. C\u00e9zanne once claimed his contemporary Monet was \u201conly an eye\u201d. No one could say that of the drawings here. C\u00e9zanne is never just eye but a complex brain, and an even more complex soul. Everything he ever drew is a silent, still explosion of insight and passion. Two drawings given by Schubert portray C\u00e9zanne\u2019s young son, Paul junior: in a little sketch on blue paper he watches Paul sleep and all the tenderness, anxiety and hopes of parenthood seem to fill each pencil mark. That intensity and clarity transfigures a drawing of a skull that C\u00e9zanne made in the 1890s into a shattering modern memento mori. Skulls and skeletons were an artistic cliche by the late 19th century. Even Van Gogh lapses into morbid tomfoolery in his 1886 painting of a skeleton smoking a cigarette. But C\u00e9zanne sees it as planes of shade and shadow. Flat blocks of pencil work create the solidity of its cranium and the pools of its vacant eye sockets. It is a dazzling still life study \u2013 an intensely fresh act of observation. By seeing it like this he frees the skull of hokey symbolism. Paradoxically, that lets the reality of death hit us afresh. About 20 years before he drew that proto-Cubist skull, C\u00e9zanne etched his 1873 print Armand Guillaumin with the Hanged Man. This image of a fellow artist haunted by an executed corpse in the background is typical of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s romantic obsession with death and crime \u2013 the dark side of himself that he conquers in his study of a skull only to make its mortal menace more real. C\u00e9zanne turned symbols into things, and things into art. In the process he invented modernism. His art is electrifyingly tense because the transformations his pencil creates are never easy. Death is still death when you see it objectively. And the human body is still the human body, however hard you try to see it as a formal nude. At the heart of this exhibition are works in which C\u00e9zanne tries to master his turbulent and enigmatic sexuality. His study After the Antiquity: Crouching Venus, which dates from about 1894-7, is a close-up drawing of a broken statue. He looks at it formally, mapping its shape with apparent objectivity. Yet the marble seems alive. Venus has a creased, rucked-up stomach. Is she stone or flesh? Can the artist bring his nude to life, like the sculptor Pygmalion in ancient myth? In two copies given by Schubert of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s great lithograph The Bathers (Large Plate), his attempt to transcend the pain of desire and enter an abstract realm of pastoral peace produces a modernist masterpiece. Four young men who\u2019ve been bathing pose and cavort in a fiery Provence landscape. Behind them is an extinct volcano whose flat top is oddly truncated, maybe suggesting impotence.

Ruth Lane has been served with an eviction notice after falling into rent arrears since her husband, Don, 53, collapsed and died from a heart attack related to diabetes. At the time he worked for the parcel delivery giant DPD in January 2018. Lane was charged \u00a3150 by DPD when he missed work to attend a hospital appointment and subsequently missed three other appointments for fear of further charges. Before his death he had collapsed twice while working, including once at the wheel. His widow alleges he was ill and vomiting blood before he died, but didn\u2019t take time off for fear of being charged again by DPD. His death sparked anger among Conservative and Labour MPs in parliament when it was revealed by the Guardian. The filmmaker Ken Loach said he had Lane\u2019s story in mind when he made his latest critically acclaimed feature film, Sorry We Missed You, examining the impact of the UK gig economy on one family, which will be released in November. Lane was treated as self-employed so his family were not able to claim death-in-service payments from which many employed workers benefit and he had no life insurance.

Ruth Lane\u2019s landlords reduced her rent when she said she could no longer afford the small Dorset house she shared with Don, but despite working full-time for Marks &amp; Spencer she cannot even cover the lower cost and has been ordered to leave.

The gig economy is growing fast with companies such as the minicab-hailing firm Uber and delivery firm Hermes also relying on self-employed workers to serve their customers. About 4.7m people in the UK work through a gig economy platform at least once a week, according to a study for the TUC which found the sector has more than doubled in size in the last three years. But gig work does not guarantee minimum wage or offer sick pay, holiday pay or pension rights, and legal rulings in favour of workers\u2019 rights have yet to take effect pending appeals, including at the supreme court. After a public outcry at Don Lane\u2019s death during the peak Christmas delivery season, DPD scrapped the \u00a3150 charges if drivers fail to find a replacement for their round when they want a day off. DPD said: \u201cDon Lane worked with DPD for 19 years and was a much-loved and valued member of our team. We were devastated by his death and, as a result, the company carried out a root and branch review of every aspect of our working relationship with our drivers and introduced a series of groundbreaking reforms.\u201d Ruth Lane is taking DPD to an employment tribunal, arguing in a case with 76 other couriers that her husband should have been treated as a worker, which would have afforded him holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage. She is also claiming that DPD\u2019s decision to charge him for missing work to attend hospital amounts to disability discrimination. DPD is contesting the case.",

      "bodyText": "She is now rich enough to buy a Maserati and holiday in Monaco, but the latest lottery winner insists a Skoda and caravanning in Skegness are still good enough for her. Vicky Mitchell, 42, was celebrating with her partner of 18 years, Adam Fry, 38, after she won \u00a310,000 every month for the next 30 years \u2013 the top prize in the national lottery\u2019s Set For Life game. Despite their newfound wealth, the couple, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said they would not be changing their holiday plans for caravanning in the Lincolnshire seaside town of Skegness next year. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat a caravan holiday with the kids. They love it. We\u2019ve already booked for next year,\u201d Mitchell told journalists, although she said she also hoped to travel to European cities such as Budapest. Fry said the current family car was a 14-year-old Vauxhall, which was \u201cfalling to bits\u201d. \u201cI Googled \u2018best family car\u2019 and Skoda came up as best family car,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cSo I\u2019ve seen a little one that\u2019ll be enough for me.\u201d Mitchell, a part-time administration assistant, said the prize was her third lottery win in a week. Having won \u00a310 on the Thunderball draw, she reinvested the cash and won \u00a35 five days later on the Set for Life game. She then spent the last \u00a31.50 left in her online account on the 12 August draw. \u201cI was half asleep when I saw the email and thought: \u2018Great, it\u2019s another fiver.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t work it out and see what I had actually won,\u201d said Mitchell. She said the money would provide financial security for her two sons. \u201cIt\u2019s still sinking in, but whereas before I would see a jumper for one of my sons and think that I couldn\u2019t afford it, I can now just buy it.\u201d The couple \u2013 who currently have a joint income of under \u00a330,000 \u2013 said they planned to continue working, but were considering moving from their two-bed terrace to a bigger property once they had saved a deposit. Fry said the money would allow him to pay off family debts. He said he would continue to account for every penny of their finances on his three-month rolling spreadsheet.",

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Monday to a new indictment that included revised charges of predatory sexual assault. The revisions forced the delay of Weinstein\u2019s trial from 9 September to 6 January 2020. The changes, which reflect new evidence presented to a grand jury this month, may enable the prosecution to add testimony from the actor Annabella Sciorra, who has claimed she was assaulted by Weinstein in 1993. Defence attorney Donna Rotunno said the changes revealed \u201cthe weakness\u201d of the prosecution\u2019s case. As he left the court, Weinstein, who was admonished by Judge James Burke for pulling out a cellphone during the proceeding, described the latest development as a \u201chome run\u201d. Weinstein has already been charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of first-degree rape and one count of third-degree rape. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all charges, maintaining that encounters with his accusers were consensual. If found guilty, the 67-year-old could spend the rest of his life in jail. Last week, lawyers for Weinstein described the arraignment as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. \u201cThere has been no case in recent memory where a district attorney has gone back to the grand jury on two separate occasions to re-present a case before that body in the hopes of obtaining an indictment that can withstand the scrutiny of a trial jury,\u201d Rotunno and fellow attorney Arthur Aidala said in a statement. The lawyers claimed the \u201caction by the prosecutor bespeaks the desperation that has engulfed their case\u201d and indicated \u201cmore of a focus on obtaining a conviction at all costs than on seeking justice\u201d. More than 80 women have alleged sexual misconduct on the part of the producer, over four decades. Prosecutors first charged Weinstein with sexually assaulting three women. Charges relating to the actor Lucia Evans were dropped over inconsistencies in her testimony raised by the defense. Evans alleged that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting in 2004. But according to public records, a witness told police Evans had said her sexual encounter with Weinstein was consensual. Among the alleged encounters that remain attached to the case, Mimi Haleyi claims Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The other accuser, who has not been identified, has accused Weinstein of twice raping her in 2013. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers claim the woman maintained communications with Weinstein after the alleged encounter, describing \u201ca consensual intimate relationship documented in more than 400 emails\u201d. Earlier this year, prosecutors amended their evidence to add Sciorra. Burke first said Sciorra could not be added to the case because she had not been before a grand jury. Prosecutors convened another such panel this month, resulting in the indictment. Weinstein\u2019s defense team has also sought to have the trial moved from Manhattan. In a court filing last week, attorneys said: \u201cIt is safe to say that New York City is the least likely place on earth where Mr Weinstein could receive a fair trial, where jurors could hear evidence, deliberate and render a verdict in an atmosphere free of intimidation from pressure to deliver a result that the politicians, the activists, the celebrities and the media demand.\u201d Burke has yet to rule on that request.",

France and Ireland have threatened to block a EU trade deal with Brazil and three other Latin American countries if Bolsonaro does not change course.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s criticism sparked an angry response from Bolsonaro, who accused him of colonialism. Under international pressure, however, Bolsonaro finally deployed two C-130 Hercules aircraft on Sunday to douse the fires.</p> <p>The reforestation plan, to be discussed at the UN next year, would require the consent of Bolsonaro and local communities.</p> <p>The Chilean president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, a Bolsonaro ally on the political right, said he was in constant touch with the Brazilian president and the two leaders spoke as recently as Sunday. He said he was confident he would be able to convince him about the need for reforestation of the Amazon.</p> <p>\u201cI will discuss that with him. But I think that it is absolutely necessary. And I tend to think that he will agree,\u201d Pi\u00f1era told the Guardian in an interview at the summit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/amazon-fires-zip/giv-39021W3LE9bSa0Wj/\" data-alt=\"Amazon rainforest fires\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/amazon-fires-zip/giv-39021W3LE9bSa0Wj/\">Amazon rainforest fires</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the last 20 years, almost 10% of the use of the surface of the Amazon has been destroyed. We can recover that. It will take time. It will take money. It will take effort but we can do it,\u201d the Chilean president said.</p> <p>Pi\u00f1era suggested that Macron and other world leaders had set about trying to make Bolsonaro change course in the wrong way, criticising him rather than cooperating with him. He argued that one of the achievements of the Biarritz summit was to establish a more collaborative process that respected the sovereignty of Amazonian countries.</p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning, there was a kind of collision between the president of France or the president of Brazil.

      "bodyText": "The G7 countries have agreed to an immediate $20m (\u00a316m) aid package to help Amazon countries fight wildfires and launch a longer-term global initiative to protect the rainforest. The assistance plan, announced by the French and Chilean presidents on Monday, would involve a programme of reforestation, to be unveiled at the UN general assembly meeting next month. \u201cWe must respond to the call of the forest which is burning today in the Amazon,\u201d said Emmanuel Macron of France, after a meeting of the G7 major industrialised democracies on the climate emergency near the end of a three-day summit in Biarritz. However, it was unclear on Monday evening whether the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, would cooperate with the plan. He sent out a string of tweets within minutes of the G7 announcement, criticising Macron for treating Brazil as if was \u201ca colony or a no-man\u2019s land\u201d. Macron conceded that Donald Trump had not attended the G7 session on climate change, biodiversity and the oceans, but he said that \u201chis team was there\u201d, and that the US supported the initiative. Environmental experts say the policies of the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, reducing environmental protections, have fuelled accelerating deforestation and contributed to the intensity of the wildfires. France and Ireland have threatened to block a EU trade deal with Brazil and three other Latin American countries if Bolsonaro does not change course. Macron\u2019s criticism sparked an angry response from Bolsonaro, who accused him of colonialism. Under international pressure, however, Bolsonaro finally deployed two C-130 Hercules aircraft on Sunday to douse the fires. The reforestation plan, to be discussed at the UN next year, would require the consent of Bolsonaro and local communities. The Chilean president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, a Bolsonaro ally on the political right, said he was in constant touch with the Brazilian president and the two leaders spoke as recently as Sunday. He said he was confident he would be able to convince him about the need for reforestation of the Amazon. \u201cI will discuss that with him. But I think that it is absolutely necessary. And I tend to think that he will agree,\u201d Pi\u00f1era told the Guardian in an interview at the summit. \u201cIn the last 20 years, almost 10% of the use of the surface of the Amazon has been destroyed. We can recover that. It will take time. It will take money. It will take effort but we can do it,\u201d the Chilean president said. Pi\u00f1era suggested that Macron and other world leaders had set about trying to make Bolsonaro change course in the wrong way, criticising him rather than cooperating with him. He argued that one of the achievements of the Biarritz summit was to establish a more collaborative process that respected the sovereignty of Amazonian countries. \u201cAt the beginning, there was a kind of collision between the president of France or the president of Brazil. Now they are working together,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said. x \u201cThe Amazon is in South America, and the countries there have sovereignty over that territory they want to protect,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said. \u201cAt the same time the Amazon is part of the health of the whole planet. And therefore it is reasonable that everybody is concerned about that. We have to find a compromise between those two. And that was the problem between Macron and Bolsonaro at the beginning, but it has already been solved because now both the G7 and the Amazon countries, with the collaboration of Chile are pushing in the same direction.\u201d The Chilean president was speaking before Bolsonaro unleashed his tweetstorm against Macron. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept that a president \u2013 Macron \u2013 fires off improper and gratuitous attacks on Amazonia,\u201d Bolsonaro wrote. \u201cNor that he hides his intentions behind the idea of an \u2018alliance\u2019 of G7 countries to \u2018save\u2019 Amazonia, as if we were a colony or no man\u2019s land.\u201d Under the umbrella of the G7 summit, a coalition of more than 50 indigenous groups and environmental organisations issued their own statement, adding to the political pressure on the Brazilian government. With the support of Macron, they directly blamed Bolsonaro for accelerating the clearance of the rainforest by \u201csystematically dismantling\u201d environmental protection agencies, halting the demarcation of indigenous land, and verbally attacking anyone who opposes forest clearance. \u201cProblems of deforestation and burning in the Amazon have a long history; however, the worsening of this situation in 2019 is a direct result of the behaviour of the government of President Jair Bolsonaro,\u201d said the statement, which was read out by leaders of the Raoni indigenous community. \u201cPresident Bolsonaro has encouraged the criminalisation of social movements and NGOs, reaching the absurdity of blaming them for increased burning in the Amazon.\u201d The declaration urged the G7 to strengthen import restrictions on beef, soy, minerals and other products that originate from areas affected by deforestation, enhance due diligence for investments in the Amazon to ensure they do not violate human rights and environmental controls, and to support Brazil to achieve the Paris climate targets.",

      "bodyText": "Many gardeners already know the uplifting feeling you get from being muddied of hand, nurturing plants from seed to bloom and watching the seasons change. It is something the NHS is increasingly taking notice of, too, as a way to improve and manage mental health, along with other conditions. A GP surgery \u2013 Cornbrook medical practice in Hulme, Manchester \u2013 has started prescribing gardening to people with anxiety and depression. Patients are given plants to care for, which are later planted in the surgery\u2019s communal garden \u2013 a place where they can join in an activity with others and strengthen social connections. There are other similar schemes, such as Sydenham Garden in south London, which takes GP referrals for its therapeutic sessions. \u201cResearch shows that outdoor exercise or \u2018ecotherapy\u2019, such as gardening or walking, has huge benefits for wellbeing and can even be as effective as antidepressants in treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety,\u201d says Aimee Gee from the mental health charity Mind. \u201cThis is thought to be due to a combination of doing more physical activity, which is known to have many physical and mental health benefits; getting more regular social contact with people, which can reduce loneliness and boost self-esteem; and being surrounded by nature, which can boost your overall mood and sense of wellbeing.\u201d The colours, sounds and smells of a garden, she says, \u201cboost our wellbeing, while nurturing a garden or allotment provides the satisfaction of completing tasks and a stronger connection with the natural environment, both of which are associated with improved self-esteem and decreased levels of anger\u201d. Monty Don, the gardener and TV presenter, has credited gardening with helping with the depression he has experienced. In a column for Gardeners\u2019 World earlier this year, he summed up the optimism gardening instils: \u201cWhen you plant something, you invest in a beautiful future amid a stressful, chaotic and, at times, downright appalling world.\u201d Even if that doesn\u2019t convince you of the magic of gardening, there is a strong possibility that other forms of non-clinical \u201csocial prescribing\u201d might be on their way to your surgery soon; other alternative treatments include arts and crafts, walking and singing lessons.",

      "bodyText": "The sweltering temperatures on the tube\u2019s Northern line will soon begin keeping homes in Islington, north London, cosy through the colder months, under a scheme to harness the heat from the underground. By the end of the year the project will pipe heat from the underground into hundreds of homes and businesses that are part of a heating scheme in the borough. The project is one of a growing number of schemes across the UK designed to warm homes using \u201cwaste heat\u201d from factories, power plants, rivers and disused mine shafts. The hunt for alternative sources of renewable heat has gained pace after the government\u2019s pledge to ban gas-fired boilers from new-build homes from 2025. The Islington heat network already keeps about 700 homes warm by channelling heat created in the Bunhill Energy Centre, which generates electricity, into local council housing, schools and a leisure centre. The next phase of the project, which is due to be completed in the coming months, will extend the network to a further 450 homes. The tube project could pave the way for district heating schemes across the capital to warm homes with cheap, low carbon heat from underground lines. The Greater London Authority (GLA) estimates there is enough heat wasted in London to meet 38% of the city\u2019s heating demands. Tim Rotheray, director of the Association for Decentralised Energy, said district heating schemes were mushrooming across the UK as a low-cost tool in tackling the climate crisis. \u201cAlmost half the energy used in the UK is for heat, and a third of UK emissions are from heating. With the government declaring that we must be carbon-neutral within 30 years we need to find a way to take the carbon out of our heating system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opportunity that has become clear to the decentralised energy community is the idea of capturing waste heat and putting it to use locally.\u201d In urban and industrial settings, waste heat is produced wherever there are cooling systems, thermal power plants or heavy industry. The key to harnessing heat is to use it locally. British Sugar\u2019s factory in Wissington, Norfolk, pipes excess heat produced from cooking syrup into a neighbouring 18-hectare (45-acre) greenhouse used to grow medical cannabis. It also pumps some of its carbon emissions into the greenhouse for the plants to convert to oxygen. An even greater source of heat lies below many of Britain\u2019s towns and cities: in the geothermal energy trapped in water at the bottom of old mines. Stoke-on-Trent is working on a \u00a352m project to tap energy from hot water deposits deep underground. This will heat conventional water before it is pumped through the network to customers. Stoke city council estimates the scheme, which will be operational by the winter of 2020, could cut its carbon emissions by an estimated 12,000 tonnes a year. In Edinburgh, engineers at Ramboll have developed a plan to create a heat network that uses the water pooled in a vast disused mine as a giant underground thermal battery. Paul Steen, who has proposed the project, believes the mine water offers \u201cmassive potential\u201d to help the city meet its sustainability goals by connecting it to a renewable heating and cooling distribution system. The flooded mine system lies up to 500 metres (1,640ft) below ground, and measures 8km (5 miles) in length by 6km wide. During the summer heat produced by cooling systems and heavy industry could be pumped down into the aquifer where it will slowly raise the temperature of the water. During the winter, the mine water would be pumped to the surface and \u201clow grade\u201d heat will be extracted in a heat exchanger. The water could then be pumped through a heat pump for heating homes and businesses. Engineers in Glasgow have even found heat potential in the River Clyde. The city\u2019s \u00a3250m Queen\u2019s Quay regeneration project will host a project that uses heat pumps to extract heat from the river water before piping it into a 2.5km-long network that includes 1,400 homes, businesses and public buildings.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Luck is human, with tendons and cartilage that can tear and bones that can break. Though his skill might seem superhuman, his ability to heal is not. Faced with the Sisyphean task of rehabbing yet another injury, Luck chose to retire from the NFL on Saturday at 29 years old. We often look at athletes with awe and envy, blessed with genetic gifts most can only wonder at possessing. But those gifts often come with a price, the unreal expectation that an athlete won\u2019t falter on the field or give in to injury. \u201cInjury and surgery is common in the NFL but that doesn\u2019t mean it is easy for an athlete to recover from,\u201d stressed Josh Dines, an associate team doctor for the New York Mets and Rangers, \u201cThese athletes make their living with their body, so when something gets injured, in addition to the physical repercussions, there are psychological repercussions as well. Fear and anxiety about returning to their previous level of play is not uncommon.\u201d Players that play through injury are championed for their toughness and determination while those that quit or retire are often derided for being soft. In a tough guy sport, the reaction to Luck\u2019s retirement has been two-sided. Some that think Luck is weak for giving in to pain and injury, while many current and former players have leapt to his defense.

Because, for football players, injury isn\u2019t an if but a when, creating a situation where an athlete is always playing through injury. The injury, surgery and rehab cycle can be arduous, so too can playing through pain. For Luck, it became too much. So, what has made Luck\u2019s injury saga so challenging? Luck\u2019s career has been spent battling injury, most of it due to a shoulder injury sustained in 2015. After missing several games that season, the Colts revealed that Luck had sustained a shoulder subluxation, a near dislocation, in an early season game against the Tennessee Titans.

It has a lot to say about what happens when the many have the fewest resources and when revolution fails to bring the promised cornucopiae, the people will swing blindly and viciously. If you have no hope of every climbing out of the coal heap and warming your hands and filling your stomach, losing your life seems paltry and preordained. It also has a lot to say about how easy it is for the well-meaning idiot to cobble together a philosophy to harness that rage (and let\u2019s not get onto the fucking nefarious idiots that we\u2019re staring down today). </p> </blockquote> <p>The Makioka Sisters by Jun\u2019ichir\u014d Tanizaki has kept <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2439109\">LeoToadstool </a>busy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Considered one of the greatest Japanese novels of the 20th century, it\u2019s a family epic centred on the lives of four sisters of an upper-middle class family in late-1930s Osaka. It has a bit of a Russian feel to it, reminiscent not of Anna Karenina (slyly referenced in the text) but of Chekhov, in its chronicling of the experiences and little dramas of family life: illnesses, excursions to shrines, visits to Tokyo, marriage proposals, migrations, etc. Not the most action-packed book ever written, but still worth persisting with. Edward Seidensticker\u2019s translation, dating from 1957, reads decently, if a little flat, and is often hilarious in its datedness (he devotes a footnote to explaining what \u201csushi\u201d is, for instance).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16137843\">FatFreddyCat</a> has also been reading about Japan, in Another Kyoto by Alex Kerr:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Kerr has spent several decades in this remarkable city and the book originated in aimless wanderings around Kyoto with a friend during which they would discursively and at length talk around various things that caught their eye as they went. It suffers slightly from the pretentious over-solemnity that Americans in particular can bring to living in Japan, but that small criticism aside, it\u2019s a fascinating book.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton has provided a wealth of useful material for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100434983\">Elias_Artifex</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ostensibly a study into the causes and treatment of melancholy (corresponding very roughly to what we would call depression) it is a actually a pretty free-ranging review of theoretical understand (cosmological, physiological and psychological) as it stood when the book was written (1621). Dr Johnson said that it was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise. I keep a copy of The Anatomy by my bed and often read a few pages to calm the mind - something about the writing has this effect. One bit that never fails to lift my spirits is the section on laxatives (very comprehensive), the application of which arises from the Galenic/Hippocratic notion that melancholy (an excess of black bile) can be relieved by purging. The idea that depression can be lifted simply by a good clear-out is very appealing somehow.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not even somehow.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>T\u00e9a Obreht\u2019s second novel is out after eight years. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/books/review/tea-obreht-inside-list.html?te=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=edit_bk_20190823?campaign_id=69&amp;instance_id=11878&amp;segment_id=16444&amp;user_id=de58d5d545b07b9e09939e21818c932a&amp;regi_id=41740674\">What took so long</a>?</p></li> <li><p>Why Beatrix Potter initially <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/596447/why-beatrix-potter-self-published-the-tale-of-peter-rabbit\">self-published Peter Rabbit</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Book riot recommend <a href=\"https://bookriot.com/2019/08/16/summer-2019-books-in-translation/\">10 books in translation by female authors</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Insects apparently have <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2401127/buzz-sting-bite-the-mosquito-book-reviews\">literary buzz</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Amazon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/amazon-orwell-1984.html?te=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=edit_bk_20190820?campaign_id=69&amp;instance_id=11773&amp;segment_id=16318&amp;user_id=de58d5d545b07b9e09939e21818c932a&amp;regi_id=41740674\">has been selling counterfeit books</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/guardianbooks/\">#GuardianBooks</a>, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.

Edward Seidensticker\u2019s translation, dating from 1957, reads decently, if a little flat, and is often hilarious in its datedness (he devotes a footnote to explaining what \u201csushi\u201d is, for instance). FatFreddyCat has also been reading about Japan, in Another Kyoto by Alex Kerr: Kerr has spent several decades in this remarkable city and the book originated in aimless wanderings around Kyoto with a friend during which they would discursively and at length talk around various things that caught their eye as they went. It suffers slightly from the pretentious over-solemnity that Americans in particular can bring to living in Japan, but that small criticism aside, it\u2019s a fascinating book. Finally, The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton has provided a wealth of useful material for Elias_Artifex: Ostensibly a study into the causes and treatment of melancholy (corresponding very roughly to what we would call depression) it is a actually a pretty free-ranging review of theoretical understand (cosmological, physiological and psychological) as it stood when the book was written (1621). Dr Johnson said that it was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise. I keep a copy of The Anatomy by my bed and often read a few pages to calm the mind - something about the writing has this effect. One bit that never fails to lift my spirits is the section on laxatives (very comprehensive), the application of which arises from the Galenic/Hippocratic notion that melancholy (an excess of black bile) can be relieved by purging. The idea that depression can be lifted simply by a good clear-out is very appealing somehow. Not even somehow. Interesting links about books and reading T\u00e9a Obreht\u2019s second novel is out after eight years. What took so long? Why Beatrix Potter initially self-published Peter Rabbit. Book riot recommend 10 books in translation by female authors. Insects apparently have literary buzz. Amazon has been selling counterfeit books.

Reporters noticed at the start of the session that the US president\u2019s chair was empty. Trump was later asked by reporters covering a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whether he had attended the climate session. He replied: \u201cWe\u2019re having it in a little while.\u201d He did not appear to hear when a reporter told him it had just taken place. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed Trump had not personally attended the climate session but that Trump\u2019s team had been present. He said he had held long and in-depth talks with Trump on the Amazon fires and that the US president \u201cshares our objectives\u201d and was \u201cfully engaged\u201d in the joint G7 effort to help Brazil put out the fires and reforest. Macron had placed the climate emergency and protection of biodiversity at the heart of the summit, even before the Amazon rainforest fires. But just before the session began on Saturday, it appeared that Trump\u2019s entourage felt discussing climate was of little importance, compared with the economy. Reports in the US said senior Trump aides felt Macron was seeking to embarrass his US counterpart by making the summit focus on \u201cniche issues\u201d such as climate change or gender equality. In 2017, Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord. Macron announced that the G7 had agreed to an immediate fund of at least $20m (\u00a316m) to help Amazon countries fight wildfires and launch a long-term global initiative to protect the rainforest. He said the Amazon was the \u201clungs\u201d of the planet and leaders were studying the possibility of similar support in Africa, also suffering from fires in its rainforests. All G7 countries \u2013 the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada \u2013 would give technical and financial help to fight the Amazon fires.

      "bodyText": "The inclusion of controversial directors and a continued gender imbalance have dominated the buildup to the 76th edition of the Venice film festival, while a mix of Hollywood A-listers and arthouse auteurs looks likely to provide another attention-grabbing event. Hirokazu Kore-eda \u2013 who won the Palme d\u2019Or in 2018 for his film Shoplifters \u2013 opens the festival on Wednesday with The Truth, which stars Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche. The French-language drama will be the first film the director has made that won\u2019t be in his native Japanese, while the French director Olivier Assayas also moves into new linguistic territory with his English-language spy thriller Wasp Network. The coveted opening slot is usually reserved for an awards season hopeful and Venice has garnered a reputation as an Oscar omen over recent years, after hosting world premieres for three of the past five best picture Oscar winners. Netflix continues its romance with the festival, and will again use it as a launchpad for its own trio of Oscar hopefuls. Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Panama Papers drama The Laundromat, Noah Baumbach\u2019s study of divorce, Marriage Story, and David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s Shakespeare adaptation, The King (starring Robert Pattinson and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), will all feature at the Venice Lido. Martin Scorsese\u2019s mob saga, The Irishman, which was bought by Netflix, will not be showing at the festival despite earlier rumours it would. Amazon is represented by political thriller Seberg, which stars Kristen Stewart as actor Jean Seberg, who was targeted by the FBI because of her support for the Black Panthers. The James Gray-directed science fiction epic Ad Astra follows in the footsteps of last year\u2019s moon-landing drama First Men, with Brad Pitt starring as an astronaut in search of his father. The Lido will also play host to the latest evolution in superhero films with Todd Phillips\u2019s Batman spin-off, The Joker, which stars Joaquin Phoenix and is being spoken about as a dark horse for awards season. Divisive directors are another feature of this year\u2019s festival. Roman Polanski debuts his latest project An Officer and a Spy, his film about the Dreyfus affair starring Jean Dujardin and Louis Garrel. The director \u2013 who was expelled from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences for his continued avoidance of an arrest warrant over his 1978 conviction for child sex charges \u2013 has been given a competition slot. Another controversial inclusion is Nate Parker, the actor and director who won the grand jury prize at Sundance in 2016 for his slavery drama The Birth of a Nation, before a historical rape allegation resurfaced and the film went on to lose millions for Fox after it was bought for $17.5m. Parker and his college roommate, Jean Celestin, were accused of raping a woman while at university in the late 90s. Parker was acquitted while Celestin was convicted, although this was overturned. The woman later killed herself. American Skin is his first film since The Birth of a Nation and is being \u201cpresented\u201d by Spike Lee, with Parker starring as an Iraq war veteran whose teenage son is killed by a white police officer. The dearth of female film-makers \u2013 only Shannon Murphy (Babyteeth) and Haifaa Al-Mansour (The Perfect Candidate) are represented in the 21-film main competition \u2013 has again been a talking point. Last year there was only one film directed by a woman, Jennifer Kent\u2019s The Nightingale, with the Venice chief, Alberto Barbera, saying it would be \u201creally offensive for the director\u201d to be included because of their gender and that selections were made \u201con the basis of the quality of the film\u201d.

This is a signal that perhaps the polemics of recent years have made an impact in our sensibility and our culture.\u201d Toronto film festival, which runs at the same time as Venice, says 35% of its films are directed by women, while Cannes had four female-directed film competing for the Palme d\u2019Or, while in February there were seven women eligible for Berlin\u2019s top prize, the Golden Bear. Prestige TV is also represented by the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, who premieres his Young Pope follow-up, The New Pope, which stars Jude Law and is a Sky/HBO TV series.

It\u2019s all about the blame game Over and again when he was questioned by reporters, Johnson insisted that a no-deal Brexit would come about only because of the \u201cobduracy\u201d of \u201cour European friends\u201d. Downing Street apparently still hopes to avoid that eventuality \u2013 and indeed some Brussels-watchers claim there are signs of flexibility emerging \u2013 but he is carefully laying the groundwork for blaming the EU27 if things go wrong. He\u2019s an animal fan Theresa May had a late conversion to the environmental cause, swiftly legislating for a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 in her final weeks in office. Johnson wants to be even greener \u2013 and in particular to focus on species extinction, which he made one of his three themes at the summit, telling leaders that tackling the climate emergency and protecting endangered species are \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d \u2013 and raising whaling with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Cynics might suggest he has the electorate in mind \u2013 David Cameron famously \u201chugged a husky\u201d as he sought to detoxify the Tories in 2006 - and the issue of foxhunting played very badly for May in 2017; but Johnson has long shown an interest in conservation. Britain is still ready to side with the EU \u2013 sometimes One of the messages Johnson was keen to land from this weekend was one he has repeatedly made since the referendum result in 2016 \u2013 that while Britain is leaving the EU, it will still have common interests with key European countries on many issues. Perhaps most symbolic of that was the fact that Johnson lined up against Trump at the testy summit dinner on Saturday evening, and insisted Russia must not be readmitted to the G7. That has been a consistent UK position, in particular since the Skripal attack, perhaps most vividly seen in Theresa May\u2019s grim-faced meeting with Vladimir Putin in Osaka. But Johnson will have been pleased to be on the same side of the argument as Merkel and Macron, both of whom he will need to work closely with in the coming days.

Here is the best from the mailbag.</p> \n<h2>Thanks a lot</h2> \n<p>I suspect most of us, distracted by whatever, have gone into a mall and paused in confusion upon leaving, trying in vain to remember where we parked in the relentless sea of cars the same colour as ours (in Arizona, white is popular for obvious reasons). That happened to my wife Mary yesterday.</p> \n<p>She is 83 and moves a little slowly. Part way down the first aisle, she realised that \u201clost car syndrome\u201d had struck her. It was 105 degrees out.</p> \n<p>A young woman in a huge SUV stopped, lowered her window, and asked if she was having trouble locating the car. When Mary nodded, the woman said: \u201cHappens to all of us. Get in. We\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mary has a handicapped tag, but doesn\u2019t always use it. She didn\u2019t think she had this time, but it turned out she was wrong. After a few circuits around the parking lot, she spotted it \u2014 in a handicapped space.</p> \n<p>The young lady let Mary out and with a wave and a smile, she drove off to her own parking challenge.</p> \n<p>Oh, how I would like to give that gracious young lady a warm hug. She made my day, and I wasn\u2019t even there! <br><br><em>Al Bell, Peoria, Arizona</em></p> \n<h2>You\u2019ll never guess who I had in the front of my taxi</h2> \n<p>A few months ago, I travelled from London to Liverpool for an interview at National Museums Liverpool. After the interview I thought I would visit some of the museums. My train was just before 5pm. And I hadn\u2019t clocked quite how late I had cut it.</p> \n<p>Unfamiliar with the city, I thought getting a bus would take forever, so I jumped in a cab \u2013 with 12 minutes to spare before my very expensive ticketed train was leaving Liverpool Lime Street. Little did I know that some cabs in Liverpool don\u2019t take cards. I had no cash on me. When the taxi driver dropped me off, I told him to wait and I would get cash out to give to him. He knew I was running late for the train, and waived the fee. Instead he said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget me if and when you get that job in Liverpool. Us Liverpudlians aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was such a kind man. Four months later, I got the job and moved to Liverpool. And I have never forgotten that first taste of Liverpool and its people.</p> \n<p>I made my train. And got the job. And just wanted to thank the taxi driver.<br><br><em>Sahar Beyad, Liverpool</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

We went into the lounge where the residents were sitting in a semicircle facing the tv which was on but which nobody was watching.</p> \n<p>As usual my mother beamed as she saw us draw up two chairs to sit in front of her. Conversation was difficult because my mother had no short-term memory but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. About half way through our visit, the frail looking lady sitting next to my mother began to weep silently. Tears poured down her face and I\u2019m ashamed to say I froze, not knowing what to say or do.</p> \n<p>My mother, who has dementia, knew exactly what to do. She took hold of her neighbour\u2019s hand and stroked it gently with her thumb all the time looking with great concern into her face until slowly the crying ended.</p> \n<p>I was deeply moved, upset and worried about the reasons for the distress and put to shame by my mother whose immediate reaction was deeply humane. No words were exchanged between them, there was no need. I left feeling I\u2019d been taught a valuable lesson.<em><br><br>Jan Forster, Cardiff</em></p> \n<h2>Birthday drinks</h2> \n<p>On my 29th birthday (I was in medical school then) I went to a restaurant/bar with some friends for drinks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e63f949c720d0b75114db0fce2d3c7800c952b2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e63f949c720d0b75114db0fce2d3c7800c952b2/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends partying in a bar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friends partying in a bar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AzmanL/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We had a bottle of wine and some other drinks and when we wanted to pay, the waiter said the wine had already been taken care of. The couple at the table next to ours had overheard us talking about our studies. They said they had once been students themselves without a lot of money and therefore wanted to do a nice thing for us. Oh and happy birthday. It completely made my night.<br><br><em>Nina Loretz, Zurich</em></p> \n<h2>Walk this way</h2> \n<p>I\u2019d buggered my knee and was in a huge brace and on crutches, feeling wretched, miserable, afraid to go out in case I fell over and broke my arm, and in fairly constant pain.</p> \n<p>One day I was crossing the road at one of those big intersections that has a diagonal crossing.

There was a stag party, loud and pretty annoying, and getting cross looks from some passengers.</p> \n<p>Then along comes an older lady, who couldn\u2019t find her case. She was going from compartment to compartment, desperately searching. One of the lads stands up, puts a hand on her shoulder and says: \u201cDon\u2019t worry love, I\u2019ll help you find it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The pair of them set about searching. Her station comes, and goes, and still the case isn\u2019t found. She starts to cry. He takes her in his arms, gives her a soft hug and tells her that he\u2019s not leaving her. He\u2019ll stay with her till the case is found and until she\u2019s gets to where she is going, even if it takes all day. She asks him about his plans and says that she can\u2019t ruin his day. He says that it doesn\u2019t matter. He won\u2019t leave her. He tells his mates that he\u2019ll see them tomorrow and then the pair of them go off to find the conductor. <br><br>Over the next hour or so we watched as the case was found, and the two worked out a plan for how to get her back to her station.

I opened the door to a girl from the downstairs bar holding a small bottle of prosecco in one hand and a glass in other. She hugged me, handed me the prosecco and said she was sorry my friends couldn\u2019t make it, but no bride should be getting ready by herself without a little bridal party.</p> \n<p>I barely knew her, but she made me a little less homesick for my friends and I felt a little less alone.

      "bodyText": "In the age of hysteria, polarisation and antagonism, it\u2019s a relief to know that simple acts of kindness are not a thing of the past. The Guardian\u2019s Upside series asked its readers to write in this summer with stories of the kindness of strangers. Here is the best from the mailbag. Thanks a lot I suspect most of us, distracted by whatever, have gone into a mall and paused in confusion upon leaving, trying in vain to remember where we parked in the relentless sea of cars the same colour as ours (in Arizona, white is popular for obvious reasons). That happened to my wife Mary yesterday. She is 83 and moves a little slowly. Part way down the first aisle, she realised that \u201clost car syndrome\u201d had struck her. It was 105 degrees out. A young woman in a huge SUV stopped, lowered her window, and asked if she was having trouble locating the car. When Mary nodded, the woman said: \u201cHappens to all of us. Get in. We\u2019ll find it.\u201d Mary has a handicapped tag, but doesn\u2019t always use it. She didn\u2019t think she had this time, but it turned out she was wrong. After a few circuits around the parking lot, she spotted it \u2014 in a handicapped space. The young lady let Mary out and with a wave and a smile, she drove off to her own parking challenge. Oh, how I would like to give that gracious young lady a warm hug. She made my day, and I wasn\u2019t even there! Al Bell, Peoria, Arizona You\u2019ll never guess who I had in the front of my taxi A few months ago, I travelled from London to Liverpool for an interview at National Museums Liverpool. After the interview I thought I would visit some of the museums. My train was just before 5pm. And I hadn\u2019t clocked quite how late I had cut it. Unfamiliar with the city, I thought getting a bus would take forever, so I jumped in a cab \u2013 with 12 minutes to spare before my very expensive ticketed train was leaving Liverpool Lime Street. Little did I know that some cabs in Liverpool don\u2019t take cards. I had no cash on me. When the taxi driver dropped me off, I told him to wait and I would get cash out to give to him. He knew I was running late for the train, and waived the fee. Instead he said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget me if and when you get that job in Liverpool. Us Liverpudlians aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d He was such a kind man. Four months later, I got the job and moved to Liverpool. And I have never forgotten that first taste of Liverpool and its people. I made my train. And got the job. And just wanted to thank the taxi driver. Sahar Beyad, Liverpool The gentle touch My daughter and I were visiting my elderly mother at her nursing home. We went into the lounge where the residents were sitting in a semicircle facing the tv which was on but which nobody was watching. As usual my mother beamed as she saw us draw up two chairs to sit in front of her. Conversation was difficult because my mother had no short-term memory but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. About half way through our visit, the frail looking lady sitting next to my mother began to weep silently. Tears poured down her face and I\u2019m ashamed to say I froze, not knowing what to say or do. My mother, who has dementia, knew exactly what to do. She took hold of her neighbour\u2019s hand and stroked it gently with her thumb all the time looking with great concern into her face until slowly the crying ended. I was deeply moved, upset and worried about the reasons for the distress and put to shame by my mother whose immediate reaction was deeply humane. No words were exchanged between them, there was no need. I left feeling I\u2019d been taught a valuable lesson. Jan Forster, Cardiff Birthday drinks On my 29th birthday (I was in medical school then) I went to a restaurant/bar with some friends for drinks. We had a bottle of wine and some other drinks and when we wanted to pay, the waiter said the wine had already been taken care of. The couple at the table next to ours had overheard us talking about our studies. They said they had once been students themselves without a lot of money and therefore wanted to do a nice thing for us. Oh and happy birthday. It completely made my night. Nina Loretz, Zurich Walk this way I\u2019d buggered my knee and was in a huge brace and on crutches, feeling wretched, miserable, afraid to go out in case I fell over and broke my arm, and in fairly constant pain. One day I was crossing the road at one of those big intersections that has a diagonal crossing. The countdown started and I could tell that I wasn\u2019t going to make it across before the lights changed. A guy crossing at the same time saw me shooting panicked looks at the flashing sign and slowed down to walk at the same speed as me so I wasn\u2019t alone in the middle of a busy intersection when the traffic resumed. Obviously the cars wouldn\u2019t have run me over but it still made me feel much safer to not be the only one in the oncoming traffic. Kate Alley, London Dental health When I was sixteen (in 1965) I ran away from home. I lived on the streets for months and got into a pretty dire state. A girl I knew looked at my decaying teeth and told me: \u201cYou must come to see my father.\u201d I was taken to a smart flat in Hampstead and was introduced to Dad, who was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis. Dr Frankel was a dentist with a private practice in Harley Street. He invited me to his surgery and, over several sessions, he gave me sixteen fillings \u2013 for free.

      "body": "<p>To see Prince William last week, traipsing across the tarmac to catch a budget flight to Aberdeen, was to watch what some said was an excellent PR move. The papers say William is feuding with his brother, and his brother just got <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49408915\" title=\"\">pilloried for taking four private jets in 11 days</a>, and then William and the kids head to Balmoral on Flybe. Genius.</p> <p>Are the royal siblings really going full Game of Thrones, or is this just a tabloid fantasy? Who can say? But still, I can relate, because if things aren\u2019t going well, a sibling relationship can be just about the worst thing going. Because siblings are dicks, and you are tied to those dicks for your entire life. If you don\u2019t like your spouse, you can get divorced. If you don\u2019t like your parents, at least they will eventually age out and die. But your sibling was born within a few years of you. They are probably not going anywhere. My brother is three years younger than me. If I live to 80, I will have known him for 77 years. When things are going well, that\u2019s a comfort. But when things aren\u2019t \u2013 and they quite often aren\u2019t \u2013 then it\u2019s rough.</p> <p>This might explain the public fighting between Julia Sawalha (aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOTpaM25QtY\" title=\"\">Saffy in Absolutely Fabulous</a>) and her sister, EastEnders actor Nadia Sawalha. During an episode of ITV\u2019s Loose Women last week, Nadia said: \u201cMy younger sister and I have always had a really stormy relationship. She\u2019s totally amazing [but we] have always had periods of time in our lives where we don\u2019t speak\u201d, causing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaSawalha1/status/1164113638938042369\" title=\"\">Julia to tweet</a>: \u201cSo tired of #nadiasawalha talking about our \u2018stormy\u2019 relationship which she created \u2026 You have destroyed our family so don\u2019t sit on TV with your fake tears to gain sympathy &amp; attention.\u201d</p> <p>Take it from an expert, this isn\u2019t how to go about confronting a sibling. By dragging their issues out into public, the Sawalha sisters have ensured that this is all they will be asked about for decades. Just like that, their relationship has become their one defining feature. It\u2019s the worst possible outcome for everyone.</p> <p>I\u2019m not one to talk \u2013 I literally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/29/me-and-my-brother-stuart-heritage\" title=\"\">wrote a book about my brother</a> \u2013 but I think I\u2019ve finally cracked the right way to deal with a sibling dip. You just have to wait it out. When we hit a rocky patch, it\u2019s always for the exact same reason: I get grumpy and he gets belligerent. It reaches a head, we swing apart for a while and then we eventually reunite. It happens every couple of years, like clockwork. But we have come to understand that this is just how it works, so now we let it happen. I love my brother and we are in this for the long haul.

      "bodyText": "To see Prince William last week, traipsing across the tarmac to catch a budget flight to Aberdeen, was to watch what some said was an excellent PR move. The papers say William is feuding with his brother, and his brother just got pilloried for taking four private jets in 11 days, and then William and the kids head to Balmoral on Flybe. Genius. Are the royal siblings really going full Game of Thrones, or is this just a tabloid fantasy? Who can say? But still, I can relate, because if things aren\u2019t going well, a sibling relationship can be just about the worst thing going. Because siblings are dicks, and you are tied to those dicks for your entire life. If you don\u2019t like your spouse, you can get divorced. If you don\u2019t like your parents, at least they will eventually age out and die. But your sibling was born within a few years of you. They are probably not going anywhere. My brother is three years younger than me. If I live to 80, I will have known him for 77 years. When things are going well, that\u2019s a comfort. But when things aren\u2019t \u2013 and they quite often aren\u2019t \u2013 then it\u2019s rough. This might explain the public fighting between Julia Sawalha (aka Saffy in Absolutely Fabulous) and her sister, EastEnders actor Nadia Sawalha. During an episode of ITV\u2019s Loose Women last week, Nadia said: \u201cMy younger sister and I have always had a really stormy relationship. She\u2019s totally amazing [but we] have always had periods of time in our lives where we don\u2019t speak\u201d, causing Julia to tweet: \u201cSo tired of #nadiasawalha talking about our \u2018stormy\u2019 relationship which she created \u2026 You have destroyed our family so don\u2019t sit on TV with your fake tears to gain sympathy &amp; attention.\u201d Take it from an expert, this isn\u2019t how to go about confronting a sibling. By dragging their issues out into public, the Sawalha sisters have ensured that this is all they will be asked about for decades. Just like that, their relationship has become their one defining feature. It\u2019s the worst possible outcome for everyone. I\u2019m not one to talk \u2013 I literally wrote a book about my brother \u2013 but I think I\u2019ve finally cracked the right way to deal with a sibling dip. You just have to wait it out. When we hit a rocky patch, it\u2019s always for the exact same reason: I get grumpy and he gets belligerent. It reaches a head, we swing apart for a while and then we eventually reunite. It happens every couple of years, like clockwork. But we have come to understand that this is just how it works, so now we let it happen. I love my brother and we are in this for the long haul. Sometimes the healthiest thing to do with this sort of relationship is to learn to weather the bad bits with grace. But William and Harry? If we take the tabloids\u2019 word for it, the budget flight last week was a manoeuvre that plays right to their deepest desires. Harry wants to look like a celebrity, William wants to look like a man of the people. This is the dance they are destined to perform forever. Next, Harry will be spotted accepting a Fortnum &amp; Mason delivery, so William will subsequently be papped in a Tesco Express. Then Harry will retaliate by shopping at Waitrose, forcing William to be photographed staggering out of an Aldi with a discount power tool under his arm or struggling to unlock a trolley with a pound coin.

Three years later and the demonstrators are back to demand an end to violence against women \u2013 but this time the mood has soured. \u201cWhat I saw on the streets was rage and desperation,\u201d Aguilar-Gomez, 28, a postgraduate student and feminist activist, said of the recent rallies in Mexico City. \u201cBecause things haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d Aguilar-Gomez is one of thousands of women who have joined the so-called \u201crevoluci\u00f3n diamantina\u201d (glitter revolution) in Mexico\u2019s sprawling capital. The movement earned its name after protesters showered Mexico City\u2019s security chief with pink glitter during their inaugural demonstration on 12 August. That protest was a reaction to the alleged rape of a teenage girl by four police officers in Azcapotzalco, to the north of Mexico City, in the early hours of 3 August. The demonstrators, who marched with placards saying, \u201cAll Women Against All Violence\u201d and, \u201cIf you violate women we will violate your laws\u201d, are also demanding broader changes in a country where an average of 10 women are murdered every day and virtually all such crimes go unpunished. \u201cIt is an unsustainable, femicidal situation,\u201d said Yndira Sandoval, a campaigner whose group, Las Constituyentes, is among those that has joined the movement. \u201cEvery day girls are going missing, women are going missing, women are being violated and raped \u2026 and we want a political response that reflects the scale of this national emergency,\u201d added Sandoval, who said she had been the victim of a sexual assault in 2017. When Mexico\u2019s leftist president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, took office last December promising a new era of social justice, many activists, Sandoval included, hoped positive change was finally on the horizon. In Mexico City, which chose L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s ally Claudia Sheinbaum as its first elected female mayor, expectations were particularly high. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to change this mess in less than a year \u2026 [But] we were very hopeful that having a woman from that political group would bring policy change to address the violence crisis against women,\u201d said Aguilar-Gomez, who said many glitter revolution protesters had backed the leftist pair in last year\u2019s vote. Nine months on, much of that hope has evaporated. Women\u2019s rights activists are mistrustful of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s alliance with hardline evangelical politicians and have condemned swingeing budget cuts, included funding for women\u2019s shelters being cut. Sheinbaum, meanwhile, infuriated feminist protesters by branding their first mobilisation \u2013 which resulted in the glass entrance to the attorney general\u2019s office being smashed \u2013 \u201ca provocation\u201d. By doing so, Aguilar-Gomez said Mexico City\u2019s government had legitimised a wave of online abuse and threats against feminists. Sheinbaum\u2019s attack sparked outrage and a second protest, on 16 August, also turned violent and resulted in one of Mexico\u2019s best known landmarks \u2013 the iconic Angel of Independence monument \u2013 being scrawled with graffiti denouncing violence against women. Aguilar-Gomez said she was frustrated that, since then, much of the media focus had been on the defaced monument and not the discrimination and attacks against Mexican women. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable \u2026 They can\u2019t see the pain in the faces of the mothers and sisters of murdered women, and the raped women, and the harassed women who were there at the protest,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are very, very, very empathetic with this lady made of stone.\u201d On Sunday, Sheinbaum met with representatives of the movement and promised a month of discussions designed to help eradicate gender violence.

Lloyd\u2019s visit to Houston Texans in 2015<strong> </strong>garnered headlines for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOdpHVEFP7A\">humorous kicking competition against defensive tackle Vince Wilfork</a>. Last week, her seamless execution of long-range field goals during a joint practice between the Eagles and Baltimore Ravens triggered the conversation that her Hard Knocks cameo didn\u2019t. The spark came from NFL Hall of Fame executive Gil Brandt.</p> <p>To Brandt and Tucker, Lloyd has the physical capabilities to kick in the NFL. Women have earned college scholarships to kick, scored points in college and professional games and even broken into professional coaching ranks.</p> <p>So what would it take for her or any other woman to be the first to make a NFL roster? It\u2019s not a question of physical limitations. Instead, it\u2019s mastering the skills necessary for anybody to kick in the NFL: Precision, focus, and a willingness to embrace a job known for psychological torment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Gil_Brandt/status/1163938536019484673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Honestly, I don&#39;t think it will be long before we see a woman break through this NFL barrier.

Kicker Becca Longo was the first woman to receive a college scholarship in 2018 to attend Adams State University (she left the school after an injury and is currently training in Arizona); free safety Antoinette Harris became the first non-specialist to receive a scholarship after playing for two years at East Los Angeles College and will attend Central Methodist University in the fall; in 2017, kicker K-Lani Nava was the first woman to ever score points in a Texas state championship game.</p> <p>One of those kickers was Julie Harshbarger. After starting her career as a high school freshman at Hononegah High Schol in Rockton, Illinois, she kicked at Rockford College for two years and seven seasons for various Chicago teams in the Continental Indoor Football League. In 2014, she was the first woman to win an award in professional football when she was named Special Teams Player of the Year in 2014, which she\u2019d win again in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cI always felt comfortable partly because I played beginning in high school,\u201d Harshbarger says. \u201cMy name was recognized by teammates in college. Social media was helpful as well. I guess my timing was good as I had a lot of people played with me and against me. When I started kicking around the indoor leagues, I wasn\u2019t the new girl showing up anymore.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/andrew-luck-retires-indianapolis-colts-quarterback\">Indianapolis Colts star Andrew Luck retires aged 29 in all-time NFL shocker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harshbarger\u2019s path mirrors a few of her contemporaries. In 1997, Willamette\u2019s Liz Heaston became the first woman to score in a collegiate game; in 2003, New Mexico\u2019s Katie Hnida was the first woman to score points in a bowl game. Kent State\u2019s April Goss remains the last woman to kick in a FBS game after scoring an extra point against Delaware State in 2016. A woman hasn\u2019t emerged as a regular on a Division I team yet, but higher participation from women makes it increasingly likely that a woman can kick at the highest collegiate level within the next few years.</p> <p>\u201cI think [kicker or punter] would be the first positions because of their independent practice model,\u201d says Dr Jen Welter, who became the first woman to coach in the NFL when she joined the Arizona Cardinals staff in 2015. \u201cIf you have a superior athlete like Lloyd and access to the right coaching then there is no reason why it couldn\u2019t happen or develop.\u201d</p> <p>When Welter mentions an \u201cindependent practice model\u201d, she\u2019s describing the solitary life of kickers and punters. While most players hone their technique among teammates, kicking specialists are often practicing alone on a separate field. To perfect a field goal requires working in concert with the long snapper and holder: the kicker must know when the holder is ready to call for the snap, the snapper must deliver a ball easy for the holder to catch and balance on the turf, and the kicker must strike it high enough, hard enough and accurately enough in between the goal posts. Run too quickly toward the ball and the kicker can\u2019t generate enough height or power; run too slowly and the defense will converge to block the attempt.</p> <p>Kickers aren\u2019t always at fault for missed field goals, but they often bear the entire blame. If the coaching staff trusts its kicker, then the job can be secure for years, even decades. But since points are always on the line, second chances aren\u2019t guaranteed.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you get a reputation as a head case, it\u2019s hard to come back even when it wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Welter says. \u201cThere could be timing issues from the long snapper, poor communication from the holder or the kicking coach messing with the player\u2019s mechanics.\u201d</p> <p>NFL teams are notorious for treating kickers like perishable goods. In Anthony Lynn\u2019s first 22 games as head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, the team employed six different kickers. The cruel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y87uP3exFjc\">\u201cdouble-doink\u201d</a> that ended the Chicago Bears\u2019 2018 season led to the dismissal of kicker Cody Parkey and triggered a sort of mania in head coach Matt Nagy. Not only has the team tried out nine kickers since Parkey\u2019s dismissal,<a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/08/21/chicago-bears-kicker-competition-obsession-cody-parkey-miss-matt-nagy-eddy-pineiro\"> a detailed report from Sports Illustrated</a> chronicled Nagy\u2019s insistence to randomly stop practice and force kickers to attempt field goals from the same place Parkey missed his kick while the team and front office watched in silence. The team currently has just one kicker on their roster \u2013 Eddy Pi\u00f1ero \u2013 and he\u2019s never attempted a kick in an NFL game.</p> <p>\u201cI think kickers have to be the mentally toughest athletes in sports,\u201d Welter says. \u201cEvery time you\u2019re on the field, it\u2019s a scoring opportunity. Imagine if a golfer\u2019s job was to sink putts with thousands of people hollering while an entire team was running at him to stop it from going in\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/22/the-formula-one-secret-behind-tom-bradys-time-cheating-dominance\">The 'Formula One' secret behind Tom Brady's time-cheating dominance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even those considered sure bets often fail. In 2016, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted Florida State\u2019s Roberto Aguayo in the second round, making him just the third kicker to be drafted in the first 60 picks since 1994. Expected to solve the team\u2019s kicking woes, Aguayo finished last in field goal percentage as a rookie. When the Buccaneers cut him midway through the 2017 preseason, he was just 23 years old. He hasn\u2019t appeared in a regular season game since his rookie year and is currently working out of football.</p> <p>A coaching staff will justify a player\u2019s poor progress at virtually every other position. But when you\u2019re a kicker, blame is seldom directed anywhere but toward the player himself. When a team doctor once notified Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells that the team\u2019s kicker was barely healthy enough to play, Parcells <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1452817908154689\">memorably responded</a>: \u201cHe don\u2019t have to play, Doc. All he has to do is kick.\u201d</p> <p>If the first woman to play in the NFL is a kicker, she\u2019ll assume one of the game\u2019s least forgiving and most psychologically taxing jobs. And if the first woman to kick in the NFL struggles, it could be a convenient excuse for NFL teams never to take a chance on a woman again.</p> <p>\u201cTo be the first of anything means setting the trajectory for anybody who comes afterward,\u201d Welter says. \u201cThey could be the reason why the door could be closed tighter after you. You\u2019re in a microscope to a degree that other people aren\u2019t. Nobody is going to ask that question if she\u2019s injured, it\u2019s just that the girl didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p> <p>Welter thinks that if the public is going to see a woman in the NFL soon, she may be from Australia. Colleges are actively recruiting rugby and Australian League Football players to punt and kick because of the skills necessary to kick during the run of play and from different angles all over the field. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/09/patience-remains-key-to-growing-womens-rugby-in-australia\">The growth of women\u2019s rugby</a> in the country has increased girls\u2019 participation, meaning young women are receiving the necessary reps and perfection of a kicking skill set.</p> <p>Harshbarger senses a more traditional trajectory for any woman to make it to the NFL: prove yourself to be one of the best at each level, then teams will have no choice but to take you.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t typically see 25-year-old guys just pick up kicking in the NFL because they have been doing it for an extended period of time,\u201d Harshbarger says. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be the first female to do this, she will probably need to be even better than the men, especially since teams don\u2019t carry more than one kicker.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd told SI\u2019s Planet Futbol TV that she received calls from some NFL teams gauging her interest.

      "bodyText": "Carli Lloyd\u2019s well-publicized visit with the Philadelphia Eagles wasn\u2019t her first appearance at an NFL training camp, but this one ended with a Hall of Fame executive advising teams to give her a tryout. The footage of Lloyd, a two-time Fifa player of the year, booting 55-yard field goals reignited the discussion of whether a woman will appear in an NFL game. Lloyd\u2019s visit to Houston Texans in 2015 garnered headlines for a humorous kicking competition against defensive tackle Vince Wilfork. Last week, her seamless execution of long-range field goals during a joint practice between the Eagles and Baltimore Ravens triggered the conversation that her Hard Knocks cameo didn\u2019t. The spark came from NFL Hall of Fame executive Gil Brandt. To Brandt and Tucker, Lloyd has the physical capabilities to kick in the NFL. Women have earned college scholarships to kick, scored points in college and professional games and even broken into professional coaching ranks. So what would it take for her or any other woman to be the first to make a NFL roster? It\u2019s not a question of physical limitations. Instead, it\u2019s mastering the skills necessary for anybody to kick in the NFL: Precision, focus, and a willingness to embrace a job known for psychological torment. While college and professional football combat a participation decline caused by fears of head trauma, women are playing more than ever before. Kicker Becca Longo was the first woman to receive a college scholarship in 2018 to attend Adams State University (she left the school after an injury and is currently training in Arizona); free safety Antoinette Harris became the first non-specialist to receive a scholarship after playing for two years at East Los Angeles College and will attend Central Methodist University in the fall; in 2017, kicker K-Lani Nava was the first woman to ever score points in a Texas state championship game. One of those kickers was Julie Harshbarger. After starting her career as a high school freshman at Hononegah High Schol in Rockton, Illinois, she kicked at Rockford College for two years and seven seasons for various Chicago teams in the Continental Indoor Football League. In 2014, she was the first woman to win an award in professional football when she was named Special Teams Player of the Year in 2014, which she\u2019d win again in 2015. \u201cI always felt comfortable partly because I played beginning in high school,\u201d Harshbarger says. \u201cMy name was recognized by teammates in college. Social media was helpful as well. I guess my timing was good as I had a lot of people played with me and against me. When I started kicking around the indoor leagues, I wasn\u2019t the new girl showing up anymore.\u201d Harshbarger\u2019s path mirrors a few of her contemporaries. In 1997, Willamette\u2019s Liz Heaston became the first woman to score in a collegiate game; in 2003, New Mexico\u2019s Katie Hnida was the first woman to score points in a bowl game. Kent State\u2019s April Goss remains the last woman to kick in a FBS game after scoring an extra point against Delaware State in 2016. A woman hasn\u2019t emerged as a regular on a Division I team yet, but higher participation from women makes it increasingly likely that a woman can kick at the highest collegiate level within the next few years. \u201cI think [kicker or punter] would be the first positions because of their independent practice model,\u201d says Dr Jen Welter, who became the first woman to coach in the NFL when she joined the Arizona Cardinals staff in 2015. \u201cIf you have a superior athlete like Lloyd and access to the right coaching then there is no reason why it couldn\u2019t happen or develop.\u201d When Welter mentions an \u201cindependent practice model\u201d, she\u2019s describing the solitary life of kickers and punters. While most players hone their technique among teammates, kicking specialists are often practicing alone on a separate field. To perfect a field goal requires working in concert with the long snapper and holder: the kicker must know when the holder is ready to call for the snap, the snapper must deliver a ball easy for the holder to catch and balance on the turf, and the kicker must strike it high enough, hard enough and accurately enough in between the goal posts. Run too quickly toward the ball and the kicker can\u2019t generate enough height or power; run too slowly and the defense will converge to block the attempt. Kickers aren\u2019t always at fault for missed field goals, but they often bear the entire blame. If the coaching staff trusts its kicker, then the job can be secure for years, even decades. But since points are always on the line, second chances aren\u2019t guaranteed. \u201cOnce you get a reputation as a head case, it\u2019s hard to come back even when it wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Welter says. \u201cThere could be timing issues from the long snapper, poor communication from the holder or the kicking coach messing with the player\u2019s mechanics.\u201d NFL teams are notorious for treating kickers like perishable goods. In Anthony Lynn\u2019s first 22 games as head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, the team employed six different kickers. The cruel \u201cdouble-doink\u201d that ended the Chicago Bears\u2019 2018 season led to the dismissal of kicker Cody Parkey and triggered a sort of mania in head coach Matt Nagy. Not only has the team tried out nine kickers since Parkey\u2019s dismissal, a detailed report from Sports Illustrated chronicled Nagy\u2019s insistence to randomly stop practice and force kickers to attempt field goals from the same place Parkey missed his kick while the team and front office watched in silence. The team currently has just one kicker on their roster \u2013 Eddy Pi\u00f1ero \u2013 and he\u2019s never attempted a kick in an NFL game. \u201cI think kickers have to be the mentally toughest athletes in sports,\u201d Welter says. \u201cEvery time you\u2019re on the field, it\u2019s a scoring opportunity. Imagine if a golfer\u2019s job was to sink putts with thousands of people hollering while an entire team was running at him to stop it from going in\u201d. Even those considered sure bets often fail. In 2016, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted Florida State\u2019s Roberto Aguayo in the second round, making him just the third kicker to be drafted in the first 60 picks since 1994. Expected to solve the team\u2019s kicking woes, Aguayo finished last in field goal percentage as a rookie. When the Buccaneers cut him midway through the 2017 preseason, he was just 23 years old. He hasn\u2019t appeared in a regular season game since his rookie year and is currently working out of football. A coaching staff will justify a player\u2019s poor progress at virtually every other position. But when you\u2019re a kicker, blame is seldom directed anywhere but toward the player himself. When a team doctor once notified Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells that the team\u2019s kicker was barely healthy enough to play, Parcells memorably responded: \u201cHe don\u2019t have to play, Doc. All he has to do is kick.\u201d If the first woman to play in the NFL is a kicker, she\u2019ll assume one of the game\u2019s least forgiving and most psychologically taxing jobs. And if the first woman to kick in the NFL struggles, it could be a convenient excuse for NFL teams never to take a chance on a woman again. \u201cTo be the first of anything means setting the trajectory for anybody who comes afterward,\u201d Welter says. \u201cThey could be the reason why the door could be closed tighter after you. You\u2019re in a microscope to a degree that other people aren\u2019t. Nobody is going to ask that question if she\u2019s injured, it\u2019s just that the girl didn\u2019t make it.\u201d Welter thinks that if the public is going to see a woman in the NFL soon, she may be from Australia. Colleges are actively recruiting rugby and Australian League Football players to punt and kick because of the skills necessary to kick during the run of play and from different angles all over the field. The growth of women\u2019s rugby in the country has increased girls\u2019 participation, meaning young women are receiving the necessary reps and perfection of a kicking skill set. Harshbarger senses a more traditional trajectory for any woman to make it to the NFL: prove yourself to be one of the best at each level, then teams will have no choice but to take you. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically see 25-year-old guys just pick up kicking in the NFL because they have been doing it for an extended period of time,\u201d Harshbarger says. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be the first female to do this, she will probably need to be even better than the men, especially since teams don\u2019t carry more than one kicker.\u201d Lloyd told SI\u2019s Planet Futbol TV that she received calls from some NFL teams gauging her interest. Would it be too much too quickly to give her a tryout now? Harshbarger believes that a woman will need to prove herself in college before an NFL team actually allows her to take a snap, but isn\u2019t opposed to wondering how it would look tomorrow. \u201cBeing a kicker in the NFL is one of the most exclusive positions in sports. There are only 32 of them since no team carries two,\u201d she says. \u201cBut If you put [Lloyd] in a game situation and she can still do it, then why not right? That\u2019d be pretty sweet.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The opening day of the Serie A season felt more like a recap sequence: that 30-second montage deployed at the start of a returning TV series to reacquaint viewers with key protagonists and story arcs.</p> \n<p>First came the champions, Juventus, totally in control and totally underwhelming as they plodded to a one-goal victory over opponents who lacked the tools to hurt them. The <em>Bianconeri</em> barely even bothered to introduce us to new cast members: only Adrien Rabiot making a 27-minute cameo. Instead there was an unexpected revival for the Gonzalo Higua\u00edn character, thought to have been written out after he was packed off to London.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/26/antoine-griezmann-copies-from-the-best-with-first-barcelona-impact-la-liga-sid-lowe\">Antoine Griezmann copies from the best with first Barcelona impact | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Next up were Napoli \u2013 flawed but thrilling in a 4-3 triumph over Fiorentina to remind us of their status as doughty underdogs. And at the same time, the villains of the piece: referees and their nefarious VAR. There were not yet 10 minutes on the clock at the Stadio Artemio Franchi when Fiorentina were awarded a penalty following an on-field review. Gaetano Castrovilli had nudged a bouncing ball on to the arm of Piotr Zielinski.</p> \n<p>To most who have played the game, it looked like an unreasonable decision. But under the new interpretations of the handball law introduced this summer, it was a correct one. Zielinski had made his silhouette \u2018unnaturally bigger\u2019 by raising his arm to gain position on his opponent.</p> \n<p>Erick Pulgar converted, before Napoli equalised through Dries Mertens. The Belgian then won a penalty with a scandalous dive. Pursuing a bouncing ball in the Fiorentina box, Mertens simply kicked his feet backwards in the vicinity of Castrovilli and went down. The referee, Davide Massa, could be forgiven for not seeing it clearly but the failure of the lead VAR official, Paolo Valeri, to alert him to his mistake was difficult to comprehend.</p> \n<p>Nikola Milenkovic pulled Fiorentina level after the break, only for Jos\u00e9 Callejon to put Napoli back in front. Kevin-Prince Boateng entered as a substitute for Fiorentina and slammed a 20-yard drive in off the post. Mertens, Callejon and Insigne all combined in one glorious movement to put Napoli back on top yet again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90e117b0c5bc83352793721b38adc3f53e20e721\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e117b0c5bc83352793721b38adc3f53e20e721/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A spectacular celebration from Kevin-Prince Boateng.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A spectacular celebration from Kevin-Prince Boateng.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fiorentina ought to have had a chance at a last-gasp equaliser. Franck Rib\u00e9ry had been sent on in the 78th minute, and in the 92nd was dragged down by Elseid Hysaj. The contact started outside the penalty area but continued into it. Massa, despite being well positioned, did not whistle. Once again, Valeri failed to alert him to his mistake.</p> \n<p>It was a disappointing note on which to end a magnificent occasion. Fiorentina\u2019s takeover by the American businessman, Rocco Commisso, has invigorated the club\u2019s fanbase. Season ticket sales were reported to be up by 20%, even before the announcement of Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s arrival. Commisso\u2019s name was sung as he performed a lap of the stadium before kick-off. Time will tell whether such enthusiasm is justified, but this is certainly shaping up as a fascinating season. Seven of the team\u2019s 11 starters on Saturday were 22 or younger. Only one \u2013 Milan Badelj \u2013 is in his 30s.</p> \n<p>As for Napoli, this was not quite the performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/22/juventuss-star-signings-mask-unease-while-inter-and-napoli-can-challenge\">some of us envisaged</a> of a team that has put together the best centre-back pairing in the division. To take all three points, however, was crucial. Next up is a visit to Juventus.</p> \n<p>Fiorentina and Napoli set a tone for the weekend. On Sunday we would be treated to a similarly helter-skelter 3-3 draw between Roma and Genoa, with the <em>Giallorossi</em> three times unable to defend a lead under new manager Paulo Fonseca. Atalanta came back from 2-0 down to win away to Spal. Their last two goals were both scored by new signing Luis Muriel, off the bench.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1165720919274397697\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83e\udd2f Genoa equalize for the third time!<br><br>Christian Kouam\u00e9 with a beautiful diving header \ud83d\udc4c<br><br>3-3! <a href=\"https://t.co/2CkVyuAmeP\">pic.twitter.com/2CkVyuAmeP</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1165720919274397697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 25, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The greatest story, however, came in Verona \u2013 where Bologna manager Sinisa Mihajlovic appeared in the away dugout less than two months after being diagnosed with leukemia. This was the first time he had left hospital in 40 days, surprising his own players when he arrived in their team hotel shortly before they were due to travel to the stadium.</p> \n<p>Ever since revealing his diagnosis to the world at a tearful press conference last month, Mihajlovic has been adamant that he would return. \u201cIt will take a bit of time,\u201d he said then, \u201cbut I will get better. This is the important thing. I explained it to my players as well. I cried a bit with them, too. I explained to them how we need to attack it. We play to win, not to avoid defeat. If we show fear, we don\u2019t have courage, we defend, then the first goal we concede, we\u2019re ruined. So I have to use the same tactics, that I like playing football. I will win this battle, definitely.\u201d</p> \n<p>The language of battles will not be universally appreciated. It is wrong to imply that an individual who dies from cancer has not fought hard enough. But Mihajlovic also has the right to define his experience on his terms. Even from his hospital bed, he has continued to coach his team, watching, advising and at times handing out stern dressings down via video chat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e7e87b1749a24ae154bebb6b1c77f6d4462f38\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e7e87b1749a24ae154bebb6b1c77f6d4462f38/0_0_3072_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sinisa Mihajlovic salutes fans before Bologna\u2019s match against Verona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sinisa Mihajlovic salutes fans before Bologna\u2019s match against Verona.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filippo Venezia/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He left the Bentegodi frustrated on Sunday night.

It is not known whether he will return to the bench for Friday\u2019s game against Spal, or take a little more time to complete his treatment \u2013 a process which has taken a visible toll on his body. In any case, it was encouraging to see him on Sunday, doing the work he loves most.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1165293640048099328?s=19\">Juventus\u2019s bench on Saturday</a>.

He was facing away from the action.

      "bodyText": "The opening day of the Serie A season felt more like a recap sequence: that 30-second montage deployed at the start of a returning TV series to reacquaint viewers with key protagonists and story arcs. First came the champions, Juventus, totally in control and totally underwhelming as they plodded to a one-goal victory over opponents who lacked the tools to hurt them. The Bianconeri barely even bothered to introduce us to new cast members: only Adrien Rabiot making a 27-minute cameo. Instead there was an unexpected revival for the Gonzalo Higua\u00edn character, thought to have been written out after he was packed off to London. Next up were Napoli \u2013 flawed but thrilling in a 4-3 triumph over Fiorentina to remind us of their status as doughty underdogs. And at the same time, the villains of the piece: referees and their nefarious VAR. There were not yet 10 minutes on the clock at the Stadio Artemio Franchi when Fiorentina were awarded a penalty following an on-field review. Gaetano Castrovilli had nudged a bouncing ball on to the arm of Piotr Zielinski. To most who have played the game, it looked like an unreasonable decision. But under the new interpretations of the handball law introduced this summer, it was a correct one. Zielinski had made his silhouette \u2018unnaturally bigger\u2019 by raising his arm to gain position on his opponent. Erick Pulgar converted, before Napoli equalised through Dries Mertens. The Belgian then won a penalty with a scandalous dive. Pursuing a bouncing ball in the Fiorentina box, Mertens simply kicked his feet backwards in the vicinity of Castrovilli and went down. The referee, Davide Massa, could be forgiven for not seeing it clearly but the failure of the lead VAR official, Paolo Valeri, to alert him to his mistake was difficult to comprehend. Nikola Milenkovic pulled Fiorentina level after the break, only for Jos\u00e9 Callejon to put Napoli back in front. Kevin-Prince Boateng entered as a substitute for Fiorentina and slammed a 20-yard drive in off the post. Mertens, Callejon and Insigne all combined in one glorious movement to put Napoli back on top yet again. Fiorentina ought to have had a chance at a last-gasp equaliser. Franck Rib\u00e9ry had been sent on in the 78th minute, and in the 92nd was dragged down by Elseid Hysaj. The contact started outside the penalty area but continued into it. Massa, despite being well positioned, did not whistle. Once again, Valeri failed to alert him to his mistake. It was a disappointing note on which to end a magnificent occasion. Fiorentina\u2019s takeover by the American businessman, Rocco Commisso, has invigorated the club\u2019s fanbase. Season ticket sales were reported to be up by 20%, even before the announcement of Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s arrival. Commisso\u2019s name was sung as he performed a lap of the stadium before kick-off. Time will tell whether such enthusiasm is justified, but this is certainly shaping up as a fascinating season. Seven of the team\u2019s 11 starters on Saturday were 22 or younger. Only one \u2013 Milan Badelj \u2013 is in his 30s. As for Napoli, this was not quite the performance some of us envisaged of a team that has put together the best centre-back pairing in the division. To take all three points, however, was crucial. Next up is a visit to Juventus. Fiorentina and Napoli set a tone for the weekend. On Sunday we would be treated to a similarly helter-skelter 3-3 draw between Roma and Genoa, with the Giallorossi three times unable to defend a lead under new manager Paulo Fonseca. Atalanta came back from 2-0 down to win away to Spal. Their last two goals were both scored by new signing Luis Muriel, off the bench. The greatest story, however, came in Verona \u2013 where Bologna manager Sinisa Mihajlovic appeared in the away dugout less than two months after being diagnosed with leukemia. This was the first time he had left hospital in 40 days, surprising his own players when he arrived in their team hotel shortly before they were due to travel to the stadium. Ever since revealing his diagnosis to the world at a tearful press conference last month, Mihajlovic has been adamant that he would return. \u201cIt will take a bit of time,\u201d he said then, \u201cbut I will get better. This is the important thing. I explained it to my players as well. I cried a bit with them, too. I explained to them how we need to attack it. We play to win, not to avoid defeat. If we show fear, we don\u2019t have courage, we defend, then the first goal we concede, we\u2019re ruined. So I have to use the same tactics, that I like playing football. I will win this battle, definitely.\u201d The language of battles will not be universally appreciated. It is wrong to imply that an individual who dies from cancer has not fought hard enough. But Mihajlovic also has the right to define his experience on his terms. Even from his hospital bed, he has continued to coach his team, watching, advising and at times handing out stern dressings down via video chat. He left the Bentegodi frustrated on Sunday night. They had been a goal and a man up in the 15th minute, after Pawel Dawidowicz was sent off giving away a penalty which Nicola Sansone converted. Verona equalised through a Miguel Veloso free-kick. Mihajlovic returned to hospital afterwards. It is not known whether he will return to the bench for Friday\u2019s game against Spal, or take a little more time to complete his treatment \u2013 a process which has taken a visible toll on his body. In any case, it was encouraging to see him on Sunday, doing the work he loves most. Talking points \u2022 Juventus\u2019s bench on Saturday. It wouldn\u2019t make for a very balanced starting XI but would you bet against it winning the league if it had to? \u2022 At least officiating mistakes are being taken seriously. Massa and Valeri have both been \u2018dropped\u2019 and will not return to Serie A duty until after the international break. That said, the new handball rule really is awful. Cagliari\u2019s Alberto Cerri was penalised for the ball striking his arm while it was on its way back to his side after he jumped to try to win a header at a corner. He was facing away from the action. The ensuing penalty provided the only goal as the Sardinians lost to newly-promoted Brescia. \u2022 A deeply discouraging start for Milan, who lost to Udinese and failed to register a single shot on goal in their first game under Marco Giampaolo. Afterwards he hinted that he might already be getting ready to ditch his preferred 4-3-1-2 , suggesting that Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek \u2013 dismal here and through much of pre-season \u2013 operates best as a lone striker. \u2022 Fresh season, fresh return for Wanda Icardi on Mediaset\u2019s Tiki Taka. She insisted that she still expects her husband to stay at Inter, despite their repeated insistence that he\u2019s not wanted. \u201cHe wants to play here,\u201d she said. \u201cI can bring a thousand offers to him, but he\u2019s the one who decides.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was, as Leipziger Volkszeitung put it, \u201can almost perfect Sunday\u201d. Before the home game with Eintracht Frankfurt, RB Leipzig had big \u2013 and surprising \u2013 news, with the announcement that star forward Timo Werner had put pen to paper on a contract extension until 2023. It was followed by something that wasn\u2019t a surprise at all, Werner celebrating in the most fitting way possible, giving his team the lead inside 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>The goal was the perfect reminder of why he is so highly prized, inside and outside the club. Marcel Sabitzer\u2019s corner was helped on at the near post by Yussuf Poulsen \u2013 behind Werner, who twisted with one graceful, dextrous, instinctive movement to sweep inside Kevin Trapp\u2019s far post. A difficult finish made simple, again. It also underlined the perfect synergy between Werner and Poulsen. \u201cWe know each other really well,\u201d the latter reflected. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that he extended.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1165623329241391110\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1.46pm: New four-year deal announced. \u270d\ufe0f<br>2.42pm: Open scoring for RB Leipzig. \u26bd\ufe0f<br><br>A true poacher's finish from Timo Werner! <a href=\"https://t.co/IKfApv5hWQ\">pic.twitter.com/IKfApv5hWQ</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1165623329241391110?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 25, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Most of us can make significant presumptions about players based on their on-pitch gait and demeanour. Werner is not looked upon as an alpha and is still judged by some Bundesliga fans for his move east when, as Leipzig\u2019s first major domestic signing after promotion in 2016, he swapped sinking Stuttgart \u2013 his hometown club \u2013 for the rising newbies. Few knew what quite to expect, and even fewer approved. Having become Stuttgart\u2019s youngest ever first-teamer when making his debut in an August 2013 Europa League qualifier \u2013 he was 17 years old and still at school \u2013 Werner had been visible, and feted, for a while. For feted, after that move to Leipzig, read slated.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/26/antoine-griezmann-copies-from-the-best-with-first-barcelona-impact-la-liga-sid-lowe\">Antoine Griezmann copies from the best with first Barcelona impact | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some of the criticism from the terraces was harsh and personal, but Werner just brushed it off and his rise has been almost inseparable from Leipzig\u2019s. In his three-season tenure, his goal tallies have been 21, 21 and 19. Strength is not one of the first adjectives most would use to describe a player largely defined by pace and guile \u2013 features which suit his current team down to the ground \u2013 but he has shown considerable fortitude not to let brickbats, his involvement in Germany\u2019s miserable 2018 World Cup or his contractual situation knock him off course.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith or without a contract extension, it doesn\u2019t change the way I am on the pitch,\u201d he insisted after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal. I scored 16 [Bundesliga] goals last season despite the contract negotiations.\u201d Those negotiations have dragged, dragged and dragged some more.

      "bodyText": "It was, as Leipziger Volkszeitung put it, \u201can almost perfect Sunday\u201d. Before the home game with Eintracht Frankfurt, RB Leipzig had big \u2013 and surprising \u2013 news, with the announcement that star forward Timo Werner had put pen to paper on a contract extension until 2023. It was followed by something that wasn\u2019t a surprise at all, Werner celebrating in the most fitting way possible, giving his team the lead inside 10 minutes. The goal was the perfect reminder of why he is so highly prized, inside and outside the club. Marcel Sabitzer\u2019s corner was helped on at the near post by Yussuf Poulsen \u2013 behind Werner, who twisted with one graceful, dextrous, instinctive movement to sweep inside Kevin Trapp\u2019s far post. A difficult finish made simple, again. It also underlined the perfect synergy between Werner and Poulsen. \u201cWe know each other really well,\u201d the latter reflected. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that he extended.\u201d Most of us can make significant presumptions about players based on their on-pitch gait and demeanour. Werner is not looked upon as an alpha and is still judged by some Bundesliga fans for his move east when, as Leipzig\u2019s first major domestic signing after promotion in 2016, he swapped sinking Stuttgart \u2013 his hometown club \u2013 for the rising newbies. Few knew what quite to expect, and even fewer approved. Having become Stuttgart\u2019s youngest ever first-teamer when making his debut in an August 2013 Europa League qualifier \u2013 he was 17 years old and still at school \u2013 Werner had been visible, and feted, for a while. For feted, after that move to Leipzig, read slated. Some of the criticism from the terraces was harsh and personal, but Werner just brushed it off and his rise has been almost inseparable from Leipzig\u2019s. In his three-season tenure, his goal tallies have been 21, 21 and 19. Strength is not one of the first adjectives most would use to describe a player largely defined by pace and guile \u2013 features which suit his current team down to the ground \u2013 but he has shown considerable fortitude not to let brickbats, his involvement in Germany\u2019s miserable 2018 World Cup or his contractual situation knock him off course. \u201cWith or without a contract extension, it doesn\u2019t change the way I am on the pitch,\u201d he insisted after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal. I scored 16 [Bundesliga] goals last season despite the contract negotiations.\u201d Those negotiations have dragged, dragged and dragged some more. It was widely expected that Werner would move to Bayern Munich this summer, with his original deal due to expire next summer \u2013 especially after he turned down the chance to join Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, seemingly making clear his intentions. Leipzig\u2019s willingness to play hardball was already clear. A recent report in Bild suggested their latest move in their game of poker with Bayern was actually to up the asking price for Werner as the deadline approached, with the momentum having fallen from the champions\u2019 transfer plans before the signings of Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho. Getting Werner to put pen to paper is an unexpected twist, though. It\u2019s not necessarily the epilogue to the story between the forward and Bayern, with a high likelihood that an achievable release clause (around the \u20ac30m mark) or a gentlemen\u2019s agreement with a view to a future transfer has been worked into the deal. That he is prepared to commit even his short-to-medium-term future to Leipzig is a huge vote of confidence for the club and new coach Julian Nagelsmann, a leader who exudes ambition. \u201cOf course, this process has been going on for a very long time,\u201d Werner said, \u201dbut I really wanted to be completely sure that I could take the next steps in the development of this club. And for the right decisions you just need a little longer.\u201d Exactly what those ambitions are, and how immediately Leipzig intend to realise them, is becoming acutely clear. Bayern have grabbed the spotlight by signing Coutinho, while Dortmund\u2019s strong start rightly commands attention, but there is little reason why this Bundesliga can\u2019t be a three-team race. Werner\u2019s decision to commit to Leipzig, leaving Bayern as an option for later, suggests he feels that he has as much chance of the title right where he is now, with learning from Nagelsmann rather than working with Kovac \u2013 who is far from secure \u2013 the better bet. Leipzig were not vintage after Werner\u2019s opener, with Frankfurt surprisingly spritely given their exacting Europa League derby with Strasbourg. Ante Rebic\u2019s omission (after sporting director Fredi Bobic publicly tore him out for his current attitude) meant none of Adi H\u00fctter\u2019s big three up front were here, following the exits of Luka Jovi\u0107 to Real Madrid and S\u00e9bastien Haller to West Ham. The heatwave sweeping Germany \u2013 that elicited water breaks in the weekend\u2019s games \u2013 had other effects too. Leipzig were unable to keep up their trademark intensity, sensibly opting to drop and conserve energy with the game seemingly under control \u2013 Nagelsmann later told reporters he felt his team had gained a \u201clucky victory\u201d, which seemed harsh. The noise levels in the stands were subduedtoo, with fans at the Red Bull Arena reporting that no water was available during the first half and that, by the time it was, huge queues meant supporters missing several minutes of the game. On the pitch, Leipzig had a late wobble when Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia pulled a goal back after Poulsen\u2019s excellent volley made it 2-0. That Nagelsmann\u2019s irritation was matched by his players\u2019 thoughts, though, said a lot about how the new man and his charges are already on the same page, and the sort of standards he has instilled. Poulsen complained that, despite the win, \u201cthere were many things that we could have done a lot better, and that we did too slowly\u201d. Werner\u2019s expectations have always been high. His signature is acknowledgement of just where all of Leipzig thinks their team is going \u2013 right away. Talking points \u2022 Bayern kicked back into gear in the Saturday night game at Schalke.

For while Bell was the sort of man who appealed to her as a courtier, smooth, blunt and with the looks of a 1950s British cinema leading man, he really had little congruence with ordinary people, despite having been born in suburban north London and educated at a state grammar school. Hard drinking, heavy on the expenses, an 80-a-day smoker, living in Belgravia, his was a life of backstage whispers and casual amorality in business. \u201cThe only talent I have is charm,\u201d he admitted to Campaign magazine in 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec38d6053633dc164ad9dcefda7416450690c6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec38d6053633dc164ad9dcefda7416450690c6c3/12_131_2453_1471/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Bell with Margaret Thatcher in 2002.

She subsequently married Peter Pettit, a solicitor, who became the Conservative mayor of Marylebone in 1961. Bell was educated at Queen Elizabeth grammar school, Barnet, but left at 17 to become a messenger in the postroom at ABC Television.</p> <p>He had apparently thought of becoming a teacher, but subsequently claimed in the Daily Telegraph in 2015 that he had decided against the profession because of its \u201clazy, whingeing, Guardian-obsessed staff rooms\u201d. Instead, he worked his way through a series of jobs in advertising agencies before joining the brothers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charles-saatchi\" title=\"\">Charles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/campaign-maurice-saatchi-speaks-there-plan-start-world-domination/1494817\" title=\"\">Maurice Saatchi</a>, who in 1970 were starting their own advertising agency.</p> <p>It was a hard-driving upstart in the industry, hustling for business with a contempt for the larger, longer-established companies. Bell fitted right in. Known to some, though not to Maurice or Charles, as the third brother, he became unofficial managing director, building contacts with national newspaper editors and smoothing over internal rows. In 1979, when the Saatchis won the Tory account for the forthcoming election, it was Bell who was deputed to liaise with Thatcher.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">James Callaghan</a>\u2019s Labour government was faltering anyway, the agency\u2019s aggressive campaign probably helped to tip the balance, especially with the poster campaign showing a long line of unemployed claimants \u2013 really Conservative party volunteers recruited for the occasion.</p> <p>Bell claimed credit for the campaign, though others at Saatchi and Saatchi devised the poster. Thatcher apparently had to be convinced that the slogan Labour Isn\u2019t Working would be effective since it named the Tories\u2019 opponents in larger type than theirs. One of Bell\u2019s tasks, then and subsequently, was to steer her away from some of her more naive suggestions.</p> <p>He remained as an unofficial adviser throughout Thatcher\u2019s term in office, calling in for late-night drinks. In 1984 he was seconded to the National Coal Board to advise on presentation during the miners\u2019 strike, though he had only limited success with its brusque and awkward Scottish-American chairman <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-ian-mcgregor-436282.html\" title=\"\">Sir Ian MacGregor</a>.</p> <p>A motto that appealed to Bell was: \u201cWhy tell the truth when a lie will do?\u201d He said in his memoirs: \u201cI am a moral man (but) there were many times when I would adopt the same philosophy.\u201d He added that he \u201cretrofitted\u201d facts: \u201cWe could in those days find statistics that proved anything \u2026 you could argue we were always trying to stretch the truth, but then everybody was at the time.\u201d When a subsequent Tory chairman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/lord-patten\" title=\"\">Chris Patten</a>, queried the veracity of a claim, Bell\u2019s retort was: \u201cWe\u2019re not saying it\u2019s true, we are saying it could be true.\u201d</p> <p>Bell left the Saatchis in 1985 to co-found his own public relations agency, Lowe Howard-Spink and Bell, which became Bell Pottinger three years later and was subsumed in 1994 into Chime Communications, of which he became chairman. Bell Pottinger became well-known for its willingness to represent rightwing figures and regimes, using the excuse that everyone deserved representation. </p> <p>Among its clients were the Pinochet regime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko\" title=\"\">Alexander Lukashenko</a>, the president of Belarus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/asma-al-assad\" title=\"\">Asma al-Assad</a>, wife of the Syrian dictator, the Sultan of Brunei and the Sri Lankan government during its war with the Tamils.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01ae3aba1d389ae81ccf94b248a8f35c88902420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01ae3aba1d389ae81ccf94b248a8f35c88902420/0_218_2047_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Bell with the journalist and broadcaster Michael Cockerell in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Bell with the journalist and broadcaster Michael Cockerell in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Kendal/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Domestically it represented the Tory minister David Mellor during his extramarital affair, the businessman Ernest Saunders, convicted of manipulating Guinness shares during a takeover battle, Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, Rebekah Wade, the Murdoch executive during the phone hacking scandal, and Neil Hamilton in his battle with the Guardian over the cash for questions scandal.

      "body": "<p>You can pretty much divide people\u2019s memories of doing their A-levels into two camps: a) those who found the experience full of detentions, sexual frustrations and \u201cyour mum\u201d jokes, akin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/01/puerile-provincial-and-prophetic-how-the-inbetweeners-became-a-classic\">The Inbetweeners</a>; or b) those who found the experience full of sex and drugs at some groovy rock\u2019n\u2019roll sixth-form college, much like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/25/skins-tv-teenage-life-truth-10-years-on\">Skins</a>. Written by father and son team Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain as \u201ca show about teenagers, but one that actually means something\u201d, Skins was commissioned as E4\u2019s flagship show.</p> <p>They held open auditions to find \u201creal\u201d teenagers, snagging Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya and Kaya Scodelario, and bagging the now grown-up annoying kid from About a Boy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/21/nicholas-hoult-interview\">Nicholas Hoult</a>) to play Tony. Skins wasn\u2019t afraid to tackle the dark issues. The very first episode included a car crash, a sleeping pill overdose, an unwanted debt to a drug dealer, and a plan to help geeky Sid lose his virginity. For comparison, the The Inbetweeners\u2019 First Day revolved around Will having to wear an embarrassing name badge, being photographed having a poo and then getting busted for underage drinking. Just saying.</p> <p>The first two series of Skins was British drama at its very best, featuring real teenage characters with real teenage character flaws. Tony is antisocial and manipulative, especially towards his girlfriend Michelle, but suffers brain damage for the whole of series two after getting hit by a bus. Tony\u2019s best friend Sid is secretly in love with Michelle. Cassie suffers from anorexia nervosa. Chris spends the \u00a31,000 his mum left him on a massive house party. And Dev Patel will never forget getting his bum out on a freezing beach in Wales.</p> <p>Panicking for an answer to how Skins could live beyond the second series when the characters had all graduated from Roundview College, Elsley came up with the ingenious plan of getting in a brand new set of characters to repopulate the lower sixth, and sending the previous actors off to the job centre/Danny Boyle\u2019s house. The third and fourth series introduced us to hard-nosed womaniser Cook, man-eating homophobic twin Katie and her lesbian sister Emily, and Freddie, who\u2019s in the middle of a love triangle between Cook and Tony\u2019s younger sister Effy. While Skins managed to stay considerably ace, the plot lines also got darker and, eventually, dafter. For example, Cook gets a handjob in a strip club, receives a death threat from local gangster Johnny White (Mackenzie Crook), and ends up with an electronic tag after getting charged with GBH for beating up a random partygoer, all when he should really have been at home revising for his A-level History paper.</p> <p>But it\u2019s when skater Freddie is clobbered to death with a baseball bat by a maniac psychiatrist in the final episode of series four that Skins finally takes the \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of this happening to me at school\u201d biscuit. Series five and six introduced us to even more new characters, but by the time Skins had turned into Goodfellas, it was time to just switch off your television and go and do something less boring instead. </p>",

      "bodyText": "You can pretty much divide people\u2019s memories of doing their A-levels into two camps: a) those who found the experience full of detentions, sexual frustrations and \u201cyour mum\u201d jokes, akin to The Inbetweeners; or b) those who found the experience full of sex and drugs at some groovy rock\u2019n\u2019roll sixth-form college, much like Skins. Written by father and son team Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain as \u201ca show about teenagers, but one that actually means something\u201d, Skins was commissioned as E4\u2019s flagship show. They held open auditions to find \u201creal\u201d teenagers, snagging Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya and Kaya Scodelario, and bagging the now grown-up annoying kid from About a Boy (Nicholas Hoult) to play Tony. Skins wasn\u2019t afraid to tackle the dark issues. The very first episode included a car crash, a sleeping pill overdose, an unwanted debt to a drug dealer, and a plan to help geeky Sid lose his virginity. For comparison, the The Inbetweeners\u2019 First Day revolved around Will having to wear an embarrassing name badge, being photographed having a poo and then getting busted for underage drinking. Just saying. The first two series of Skins was British drama at its very best, featuring real teenage characters with real teenage character flaws. Tony is antisocial and manipulative, especially towards his girlfriend Michelle, but suffers brain damage for the whole of series two after getting hit by a bus. Tony\u2019s best friend Sid is secretly in love with Michelle. Cassie suffers from anorexia nervosa. Chris spends the \u00a31,000 his mum left him on a massive house party. And Dev Patel will never forget getting his bum out on a freezing beach in Wales. Panicking for an answer to how Skins could live beyond the second series when the characters had all graduated from Roundview College, Elsley came up with the ingenious plan of getting in a brand new set of characters to repopulate the lower sixth, and sending the previous actors off to the job centre/Danny Boyle\u2019s house. The third and fourth series introduced us to hard-nosed womaniser Cook, man-eating homophobic twin Katie and her lesbian sister Emily, and Freddie, who\u2019s in the middle of a love triangle between Cook and Tony\u2019s younger sister Effy. While Skins managed to stay considerably ace, the plot lines also got darker and, eventually, dafter. For example, Cook gets a handjob in a strip club, receives a death threat from local gangster Johnny White (Mackenzie Crook), and ends up with an electronic tag after getting charged with GBH for beating up a random partygoer, all when he should really have been at home revising for his A-level History paper. But it\u2019s when skater Freddie is clobbered to death with a baseball bat by a maniac psychiatrist in the final episode of series four that Skins finally takes the \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of this happening to me at school\u201d biscuit. Series five and six introduced us to even more new characters, but by the time Skins had turned into Goodfellas, it was time to just switch off your television and go and do something less boring instead.",

      "body": "<p>What makes a town thrive? When people are choosing where to live in Britain in 2019, they are doing so at a time when many places are undergoing dramatic changes. With retail shifting online and traditional industries declining, many towns that once had thriving high streets and commercial centres are experiencing a loss of confidence and a changing sense of identity.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication/value-arts-and-culture-place-shaping\" title=\"\">latest report</a> commissioned by Arts Council England, based on independent research, shows that arts and culture are up there with good schools when people make their decisions about where to live. There is not only tangible value in investment in the arts, but also huge public demand for it.</p> <p>Of those surveyed, 44% said the local arts scene is an important factor, compared with 43% saying the same about schools. These are striking figures. The presence of a theatre, a gallery or a library \u2013 places where people gather to enjoy themselves and share an experience \u2013 can help to sustain towns through the transformations of our age. They can generate local pride and help to forge a new identity based on creativity, while still celebrating their past. As one Stoke-on-Trent resident interviewed for the report stated, having a strong cultural offer \u201cgives the impression that an area respects itself and its historical and cultural heritage\u201d. This kind of community self-esteem is crucial.</p> <p>Performances, exhibitions and festivals can arrest decline and help to make town centres attractive places to visit and socialise. The figures in the report support this, with 68% of people saying that arts and cultural events are very important for fostering community feeling.</p> <p>The most obvious example of the positive impact of art and culture in recent years is the experience of Hull, when it was City of Culture in 2017. The programme boosted the city\u2019s economy, with <a href=\"https://www.insidermedia.com/insider/yorkshire/tourism-worth-more-than-300m-to-hull-economy\" title=\"\">\u00a3300m</a> generated by the local tourism industry across the year. However, the benefits went far beyond that, helping to instil in local people a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/nov/19/what-next-hull-year-uk-city-culture-2017\" title=\"\">renewed pride in Hull\u2019s history</a> and confidence about its role in the world. By the end of the year, <a href=\"https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/pride-hull-time-high-city-1410549\" title=\"\">three-quarters of residents </a>said they were proud to live in the city.</p> <p>Hull\u2019s experience has been mirrored by that of smaller towns across the country, including a wide range of market, coastal and post-industrial towns. Since 2012, the Arts Council has invested \u00a353m in <a href=\"http://creativepeopleplaces.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Creative People and Places</a> \u2013 a programme designed to bring cultural events to areas with low levels of arts engagement \u2013 with a <a href=\"https://advisor.museumsandheritage.com/news/twelve-areas-lacking-cultural-engagement-receive-17-5-million-arts-council-funding-boost/\" title=\"\">further \u00a317.5m</a> announced earlier this month. By working with residents and local partners, the scheme allows people to shape the arts and cultural provision where they live. So far, the scheme has supported projects in <a href=\"http://creativepeopleplaces.org.uk/map\" title=\"\">21 areas</a> across England including Sunderland, St Helens, Barking and Luton.</p> <p>These projects can help to give residents a new perspective on where they live. One project, which saw Hanley Park in Stoke-on-Trent turned into a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGKZX7MAYQ\" title=\"\">pyrotechnic circus</a>, drew in many local people who were visiting for the first time, despite the park being on their doorstep. \u201cPeople are seeing it as a beautiful space to be used for recreation purposes rather than just a shortcut,\u201d said one person.</p> <p>As towns such as Margate and Folkestone show, a thriving cultural sector can also help to attract new businesses working in creative industries (this is the <a href=\"https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/job-sectors/creative-arts-and-design/overview-of-the-creative-arts-sector-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">fastest growing sector</a> of the UK economy, with the number of creative jobs increasing by <a href=\"https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/uk-creative-overview/facts-and-figures/employment-figures\" title=\"\">30% since 2011</a>).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/22/children-arts-ebacc-gcse\">Why are children forced to choose between the arts? The Ebacc must go | Bob and Roberta Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since opening its doors nearly a decade ago, <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/newly-launched-hastings-contemporary-reveals-an-entrepreurial-institutional-model\" title=\"\">Turner Contemporary art gallery has attracted 400,000 </a>visitors a year, injecting over \u00a368m into Kent\u2019s economy, and leading to the opening of more than <a href=\"https://cvansoutheast.com/news/turner-contemporary-reaches-3-million-visits/\" title=\"\">150 businesses across Margate</a>. In the summer of 2018, 35% of visitors stated they visited Margate specifically to visit the gallery. The establishment of <a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/folkestone-triennial\" title=\"\">Folkestone Triennial exhibition </a>and the development of the \u201ccreative quarter\u201d in the town has similarly shown that the arts can draw people to destinations they might not otherwise have considered, turning town centres into busy places to visit and generating increased footfall for local businesses.</p> <p>As well as considering the benefits to communities, people are also drawn to places with a strong artistic offering because they recognise the value of creativity to themselves as individuals. According to the report, nearly two-thirds of people think that arts and culture are good for wellbeing, and 36% think arts and culture are \u201cessential to life\u201d. People who attended a wide range of arts and cultural events reported higher levels of satisfaction with their lives than those who did not, even after accounting for other factors that influence life satisfaction. This is also borne out by the evaluation of the City of Culture programme in Hull, where over 90% of the residents took part in a cultural activity during the year, 80% of whom said that being part of the project made them feel happier.</p> <p>The hard evidence shows that the arts matter to people across the country, and makes clear the case for greater investment in culture. It was heartening to see Boris Johnson recognise this in one of his <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/boris-johnson-2019-speech-at-the-manchester-science-and-industry-museum/\" title=\"\">first speeches as prime minister</a>, when he drew attention to the benefits that investment in the arts had brought to the reputation, the life and the economy of Manchester over the past 20 years.</p> <p>Whether it is in bringing communities together, promoting individual wellbeing, or helping towns to adapt to changing economic circumstances, the arts have an ever-increasing role to play in helping us all to live well. By supporting our cultural sector, we create happier, more vibrant communities that we can all be proud to be a part of.</p> <p>\u2022 Nicholas Serota is chair of Arts Council England</p>",

      "bodyText": "What makes a town thrive? When people are choosing where to live in Britain in 2019, they are doing so at a time when many places are undergoing dramatic changes. With retail shifting online and traditional industries declining, many towns that once had thriving high streets and commercial centres are experiencing a loss of confidence and a changing sense of identity. The latest report commissioned by Arts Council England, based on independent research, shows that arts and culture are up there with good schools when people make their decisions about where to live. There is not only tangible value in investment in the arts, but also huge public demand for it. Of those surveyed, 44% said the local arts scene is an important factor, compared with 43% saying the same about schools. These are striking figures. The presence of a theatre, a gallery or a library \u2013 places where people gather to enjoy themselves and share an experience \u2013 can help to sustain towns through the transformations of our age. They can generate local pride and help to forge a new identity based on creativity, while still celebrating their past. As one Stoke-on-Trent resident interviewed for the report stated, having a strong cultural offer \u201cgives the impression that an area respects itself and its historical and cultural heritage\u201d. This kind of community self-esteem is crucial. Performances, exhibitions and festivals can arrest decline and help to make town centres attractive places to visit and socialise. The figures in the report support this, with 68% of people saying that arts and cultural events are very important for fostering community feeling. The most obvious example of the positive impact of art and culture in recent years is the experience of Hull, when it was City of Culture in 2017. The programme boosted the city\u2019s economy, with \u00a3300m generated by the local tourism industry across the year. However, the benefits went far beyond that, helping to instil in local people a renewed pride in Hull\u2019s history and confidence about its role in the world. By the end of the year, three-quarters of residents said they were proud to live in the city. Hull\u2019s experience has been mirrored by that of smaller towns across the country, including a wide range of market, coastal and post-industrial towns. Since 2012, the Arts Council has invested \u00a353m in Creative People and Places \u2013 a programme designed to bring cultural events to areas with low levels of arts engagement \u2013 with a further \u00a317.5m announced earlier this month. By working with residents and local partners, the scheme allows people to shape the arts and cultural provision where they live. So far, the scheme has supported projects in 21 areas across England including Sunderland, St Helens, Barking and Luton. These projects can help to give residents a new perspective on where they live. One project, which saw Hanley Park in Stoke-on-Trent turned into a pyrotechnic circus, drew in many local people who were visiting for the first time, despite the park being on their doorstep. \u201cPeople are seeing it as a beautiful space to be used for recreation purposes rather than just a shortcut,\u201d said one person. As towns such as Margate and Folkestone show, a thriving cultural sector can also help to attract new businesses working in creative industries (this is the fastest growing sector of the UK economy, with the number of creative jobs increasing by 30% since 2011). Since opening its doors nearly a decade ago, Turner Contemporary art gallery has attracted 400,000 visitors a year, injecting over \u00a368m into Kent\u2019s economy, and leading to the opening of more than 150 businesses across Margate. In the summer of 2018, 35% of visitors stated they visited Margate specifically to visit the gallery. The establishment of Folkestone Triennial exhibition and the development of the \u201ccreative quarter\u201d in the town has similarly shown that the arts can draw people to destinations they might not otherwise have considered, turning town centres into busy places to visit and generating increased footfall for local businesses. As well as considering the benefits to communities, people are also drawn to places with a strong artistic offering because they recognise the value of creativity to themselves as individuals. According to the report, nearly two-thirds of people think that arts and culture are good for wellbeing, and 36% think arts and culture are \u201cessential to life\u201d. People who attended a wide range of arts and cultural events reported higher levels of satisfaction with their lives than those who did not, even after accounting for other factors that influence life satisfaction. This is also borne out by the evaluation of the City of Culture programme in Hull, where over 90% of the residents took part in a cultural activity during the year, 80% of whom said that being part of the project made them feel happier. The hard evidence shows that the arts matter to people across the country, and makes clear the case for greater investment in culture. It was heartening to see Boris Johnson recognise this in one of his first speeches as prime minister, when he drew attention to the benefits that investment in the arts had brought to the reputation, the life and the economy of Manchester over the past 20 years. Whether it is in bringing communities together, promoting individual wellbeing, or helping towns to adapt to changing economic circumstances, the arts have an ever-increasing role to play in helping us all to live well. By supporting our cultural sector, we create happier, more vibrant communities that we can all be proud to be a part of. \u2022 Nicholas Serota is chair of Arts Council England",

Ultimately, the industry was right to reject them \u2013 I wasn\u2019t ready. But I know that I didn\u2019t waste my time on them, that they were my apprenticeship.\u201d Could we start reframing rejection as something necessary, even desirable \u2013 not shameful, but an important step on the artistic journey? Rejection doesn\u2019t automatically mean falling short; it can mean that risks are being taken, that you\u2019re innovating. At the very least, it means that you\u2019re trying. We need to be transparent about the work, about how 99% of the time it\u2019s a thick skin that does more for artists than bolt-from-the-blue talent. And also about the toll it can take on you. For years I didn\u2019t talk about my own rejection, putting up the front that every aspiring writer does. But I was steadily getting rejected from every creative writing MFA (master of fine arts) I applied to, and then by dozens of agents. When I did get an agent, it was time for my first book (still unpublished) to be rejected unanimously by publishers, then rejected again by even more publishers a while later. When my next novel went on submission I spent a lot of time having panic attacks in office toilets \u2013 until a first offer, miraculously, came through. This kind of trajectory is normal. It\u2019s often much worse. I just didn\u2019t know. During that time I craved normal stories of rejection. I wanted to know about the unseen work, not the eight-figure deals and one-hour pre-empts. I didn\u2019t want to know about the breathless JK Rowling stuff either. I wanted to know whether it was possible to make some kind of living as an artist without having a breakdown. I wanted to know about the capacity of a person to just keep going even when every response is a no. When I\u2019m asked now if my first novel \u2013 my real first novel, sort of \u2013 might be published, I say no. I can see how it was still the work of someone finding their way. Those rejections gave me resilience. They were what I needed to allow me to write something better, still encourage me to write something better. With accepting rejection we find the space to do that. We realise that most others in the arts are in the same place. And maybe we\u2019d be a little kinder and patient with ourselves and others, knowing this. \u2022 Sophie Mackintosh is an author.

For some, it is Bake Off\u2019s magical ability to induce the warm contentment, sprinkled with mild hysteria, of eating cake. For others, it is the unbridled joy of a lion made out of bread by a prison governor. It combines the bunting-encircled days of the village hall fete with an irresistible, if concocted, vision of modern, diverse, harmonious Britain. In fact, The Great British Bake Off may be the last acceptable form of nostalgia in the UK.</p> <p>In preparation for the 10th series, why not smooth on a few more layers of wistfulness with our rundown of the best moments from the past nine \u2026</p> <h2><strong>1.

A prototype pep-talk containing all the ingredients of Bake Off\u2019s future success: pathos, humour, a rounded teaspoon of melancholia, and words like \u201cpeepers\u201d.</p> <h2>2.

Brendan Lynch greasing up his arms to stretch his dough! John Whaite confusing salt and sugar in a technical round, causing Paul Hollywood to retch over his rum babas! James Morton\u2019s Fair Isle knits! But no, the winner must be Cathryn Dresser. In episode six, Hollywood\u2019s advice to \u201cbuild up the resistance\u201d of strudel dough by grabbing, twisting, slapping and tossing it until you win virile baker of the year at the county fair was taken too enthusiastically by Cathryn, who catapulted hers to the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s so hairy!\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not serving Mary Berry green carpet.\u201d</p> <h2>4. #Custardgate</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b91255d597d98f8c2fa4190168da1ee88c4fcf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b91255d597d98f8c2fa4190168da1ee88c4fcf1/0_71_1433_860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Howard sees the funny side of Deborah\u2019s wicked theft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Howard sees the funny side of Deborah\u2019s wicked theft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The controversial one, and not just because Sue elbowed Howard\u2019s muffins. This was the series in which Ruby Tandoh \u2013 in the top five contestants of all time for her technical skill in folding bad attitude into false modesty \u2013 was accused of being favoured by Hollywood. Which turned out to just be vintage misogyny. Best moment, however, goes to #Custardgate, in which Howard became a victim of theft after Deborah used his cr\u00e8me anglaise in her trifle.

President argues for Putin\u2019s input on Iran and North Korea Donald Trump has raised hackles at the G7 summit in Biarritz after demanding Russia be readmitted to the group, five years after it was ejected from the then-G8 for its annexation of Crimea. The US president reportedly argued that Vladimir Putin ought to be included in discussions on issues such as Iran, Syria and North Korea. But a diplomatic source said most of the other G7 leaders \u201cinsisted\u201d on the group remaining \u201ca community of liberal democracies\u201d. UK trade deal. Trump talked up a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK as he met Boris Johnson for the first time since Johnson became prime minister, though Johnson later said the US timetable to reach a deal in a year was \u201ctight\u201d. Iran talks. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, made a surprise visit to the Biarritz summit to meet French, British and German officials, adding to tensions between Trump and European leaders. White House heralds Japan deal as China trade war continues Trump and Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, have agreed the core elements of a new trade deal the two men hope to sign in New York next month. The rapprochement comes amid Washington\u2019s continuing trade war with China, which roiled Asian markets again on Monday. Trump suggested to reporters at the G7 summit that he was having \u201csecond thoughts\u201d about hiking tariffs on Chinese goods, but the White House insisted later that his only regret had been not raising them higher. Primary challenge. The former Trump supporter and Tea Party congressman Joe Walsh has announced he will mount a primary challenge to Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination. \u2018Nuking\u2019 hurricanes. Trump has reportedly suggested to advisers on more than one occasion that the US should deal with the threat of hurricanes by \u201cnuking\u201d the storms as they cross the Atlantic. Warplanes douse burning Amazon amid international outcry Brazilian warplanes have started dumping water on wildfires in the Amazon as G7 leaders expressed serious concerns over the record blazes afflicting the rainforest. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who last week bristled at international criticism, authorised military operations to fight the fires in seven states on Sunday. President Emmanuel Macron of France said the G7 was nearing a deal to provide assistance to affected countries, including Bolivia, where the blazes have wreaked havoc. Manmade blazes. Scientists agree that humans are largely to blame for the Amazon wildfires. David Miranda says the policy choices of Bolsonaro and his extremist environment minister, Ricardo Salles, have fuelled and fanned the flames. Weinstein due in court over Annabella Sciorra indictment Harvey Weinstein is due back in court in New York on Monday to face a new indictment involving the actor Annabella Sciorra. Weinstein has already been charged with several crimes including one count of first-degree rape and one of third-degree rape, but has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said all the encounters were consensual. Sciorra has accused Weinstein of a sexual assault at her apartment in 1993, but it is not clear whether the disgraced movie producer will face additional charges over her allegations. Trial date. Weinstein\u2019s trial is set to begin in less than three weeks but could be delayed by the addition of an extra charge. It is likely that, instead, prosecutors hope to include Sciorra\u2019s testimony to establish a pattern of criminal behaviour. Crib sheet Prince Andrew was onboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private jet for a previously undisclosed trip from the US Virgin Islands to Florida in 1999, with other passengers including Ghislaine Maxwell and a 27-year-old Russian model. Russia\u2019s state weather agency has confirmed there was a spike in radiation levels following a mysterious nuclear accident during a military test near the city of Severodvinsk earlier this month. The EU has said it would refuse to negotiate a trade deal with the UK after a no-deal Brexit, if \u2013 as Boris Johnson has threatened \u2013 the UK were to withhold much of the \u00a339bn Brexit \u201cdivorce settlement\u201d agreed by Theresa May. Environmentalists in Florida are battling a plan by Nestl\u00e9 to draw more than 1.1m gallons of water a day from the state\u2019s idyllic and ecologically critical Ginnie Springs to sell as bottled water. Must-reads Rosanna Arquette on Weinstein: \u2018I was never safe\u2019 When Rosanna Arquette rebuffed Harvey Weinstein\u2019s advances at a Beverly Hills hotel room in the early 1990s, she thought: \u201cHe\u2019s going to take me down.\u201d And she believes the now-disgraced producer did just that, she tells Paula Cocozza, sending her from \u201cthe top of A-list to bottom of the C-minus list within minutes.\u201d Treating the trauma caused by climate change Wildfires and weather caused by the climate crisis are destroying Americans\u2019 homes and lives.

The hormone combinations are put together, usually as creams or gels, by pharmacists working in private clinics. The dose of the different hormones used varies from one woman to the next.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ecf80ac3-30ef-410b-b005-1463dcde27c5\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.</p>\n    <p>Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Symptoms can begin months or years before periods stop \u2013 this time is called the perimenopause \u2013 and can last around four years after the last period. However, some women have them for much longer, with 10% experiencing symptoms for up to 12 years.</p>\n    <p>About 25% of women experience such severe symptoms that they can be diagnosed with mental health problems. The principal treatment is hormone replacement therapy, which can control symptoms well, but does increase the chances of breast and ovarian cancer.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The British Menopause Society (BMS) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have warned women away from the products, which are becoming increasingly popular.</p> \n<p>Menopause experts said women should opt instead for the pre-packed regulated bioidentical HRT (rBHRT). These therapies, available on the NHS, are also duplicates of human hormones but are in fixed doses and licensed by the medicines regulator.</p> \n<p>Hormone replacement therapy is the main form of treatment for severe menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes, insomnia and low mood. Taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants, it acts by replacing oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone, in the body.</p> \n<p>The unregulated version has recently increased in popularity because of a proliferation of online pharmacies and active marketing to consumers. However the BMS and RCOG said there could be problems with overdosing or underdosing, the presence of impurities or lack of sterility, a lack of scientific efficacy and safety data (compounded products are not tested on humans) and a lack of labelling to outline risks.</p> \n<p>The experts also said the cBHRT practice of saliva and serum hormone testing to determine dosing was unreliable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/26/what-is-the-menopause-and-when-does-it-strike\">What is the menopause and when does it strike?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The BMS and RCOG have become so concerned by the increasing use of cBHRT that they have taken the unprecedented step of issuing a full consensus statement.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery expert in the field shares the same view and concerns about compounded hormones: it\u2019s unsafe, untested and unnecessary. We are concerned by its purity, potency and safety,\u201d said Haitham Hamoda, the chair of the BMS, spokesperson for the RCOG and a consultant gynaecologist at King\u2019s College hospital foundation trust.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can get bioidentical HRT on the NHS: 95% of my 2,500 patients at King\u2019s are on it.

      "bodyText": "Women are being warned not to use a form of hormone replacement therapy marketed as being \u201cmore natural\u201d than that available from NHS doctors, with experts saying it is unsafe, expensive and could increase the risk of developing cancer. Compounded bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (cBHRT) is tailor-made for each person, using hormones identical to those produced in a woman\u2019s body. The hormone combinations are put together, usually as creams or gels, by pharmacists working in private clinics. The dose of the different hormones used varies from one woman to the next. The British Menopause Society (BMS) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have warned women away from the products, which are becoming increasingly popular. Menopause experts said women should opt instead for the pre-packed regulated bioidentical HRT (rBHRT). These therapies, available on the NHS, are also duplicates of human hormones but are in fixed doses and licensed by the medicines regulator. Hormone replacement therapy is the main form of treatment for severe menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes, insomnia and low mood. Taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants, it acts by replacing oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone, in the body. The unregulated version has recently increased in popularity because of a proliferation of online pharmacies and active marketing to consumers. However the BMS and RCOG said there could be problems with overdosing or underdosing, the presence of impurities or lack of sterility, a lack of scientific efficacy and safety data (compounded products are not tested on humans) and a lack of labelling to outline risks. The experts also said the cBHRT practice of saliva and serum hormone testing to determine dosing was unreliable. The BMS and RCOG have become so concerned by the increasing use of cBHRT that they have taken the unprecedented step of issuing a full consensus statement. \u201cEvery expert in the field shares the same view and concerns about compounded hormones: it\u2019s unsafe, untested and unnecessary. We are concerned by its purity, potency and safety,\u201d said Haitham Hamoda, the chair of the BMS, spokesperson for the RCOG and a consultant gynaecologist at King\u2019s College hospital foundation trust. \u201cYou can get bioidentical HRT on the NHS: 95% of my 2,500 patients at King\u2019s are on it. But the key thing is that it\u2019s not compounded: rBHRT is prescribed and manufactured under very strict regulations. In contrast, there is no medical evidence to support cBHRT.\u201d The experts say the dose of oestrogen in cBHRT may be higher or lower than it needs to be to control symptoms, and that the dose of progesterone may not always be sufficient to protect the womb. \u201cIf the womb is not sufficiently protected, there is a cancer risk,\u201d Hamoda said. Many cBHRT applications deliver progesterone through the skin. \u201cAbsorption is variable with fluctuating tissue availability and as a result, may not provide sufficient protection for wombs,\u201d Hamoda said. \u201cAgain, that\u2019s a cancer risk.\u201d Dr Louise Newson, a menopause expert, said: \u201cWe see many women at Newson Health clinic who have spent considerable amounts of money on these bioidentical products and have experienced numerous side effects. \u201cCompounded bioidentical products are not regulated or approved and so could potentially be harmful. In addition, there is no evidence that these bioidentical hormones have fewer side effects or are more effective than prescribed HRT.\u201d In 2017, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled against the promotion of cBHRT as having greater safety and efficacy than rBHRT, and said there was insufficient evidence to back the practice of cBHRT practitioners using expensive serum and saliva tests to individualise therapy. However, the Marion Gluck Clinic, which claims to be the leading UK medical clinic specialising in the use of bioidentical hormones, defended cBHRT. \u201cJust like any other medical practice, the Marion Gluck Clinic is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC),\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cIn addition, compounding cBHRT is carried out under strict supervision of a qualified pharmacist on a named patient basis.\u201d The popularity of cBHRT rose after the publication of findings in 2002 that conventional HRT carried a cancer risk.

And between a third of and half of us think it is more likely that in heterosexual couples men will initiate and orgasm during sex, and decide when sex is finished, than women. In contrast, women are believed to be much more likely to refuse sex and to \u201cgo along with sex to keep their partner happy\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The 'orgasm gap' exists solely in heterosexual sex  \u2013 lesbians are not having this problem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This shows the persistence of the idea that sex is more \u201cfor\u201d men than it is for women. The female climax is talked about in terms of being elusive, and yet the fact that this \u201corgasm gap\u201d exists solely in heterosexual sex speaks to a lack of understanding, effort and mutuality, because lesbians are not having this problem. It\u2019s a product of setting up the male orgasm, usually achieved through penile penetration, as the centrepiece of sex.</p> <p>It is a sad state of affairs that there is a lower expectation that women will experience pleasure or climax during sex, and that this is accepted as to be expected, or \u201cnormal\u201d. It\u2019s self-perpetuating, because if women believe that \u201cgoing along\u201d with sex is a common female experience, they may be less likely to articulate and explore their needs and wants in early sexual relationships or when older.

      "bodyText": "We may like to think we\u2019re quite sexually free and equal these days, but an End Violence Against Women Coalition/YouGov survey of nearly 4,000 adults finds that two-fifths of people think men want sex more than women do. And between a third of and half of us think it is more likely that in heterosexual couples men will initiate and orgasm during sex, and decide when sex is finished, than women. In contrast, women are believed to be much more likely to refuse sex and to \u201cgo along with sex to keep their partner happy\u201d. This shows the persistence of the idea that sex is more \u201cfor\u201d men than it is for women. The female climax is talked about in terms of being elusive, and yet the fact that this \u201corgasm gap\u201d exists solely in heterosexual sex speaks to a lack of understanding, effort and mutuality, because lesbians are not having this problem. It\u2019s a product of setting up the male orgasm, usually achieved through penile penetration, as the centrepiece of sex. It is a sad state of affairs that there is a lower expectation that women will experience pleasure or climax during sex, and that this is accepted as to be expected, or \u201cnormal\u201d. It\u2019s self-perpetuating, because if women believe that \u201cgoing along\u201d with sex is a common female experience, they may be less likely to articulate and explore their needs and wants in early sexual relationships or when older. They may also feel pressure not to express discomfort or pain. And when sex is only one part of a long-term relationship, alongside persistent inequality around work, chores, caring and other people\u2019s gendered expectations, plain talking and yet another plea for fairness might be just one battle too many. Sexual inequality matters enormously, in and of itself, because women should be able to expect and enjoy sexual relationships that are based on mutual pleasure and equality.

The 2.9-magnitude quake, recorded near Cuadrilla\u2019s site near Blackpool on Monday morning, is believed to be the biggest fracking-related tremor seen in Britain. Operations at the Preston New Road site had been suspended since Wednesday night after a series of gradually increasing \u201cmicroseismic events\u201d. Yet the 2.9-magnitude tremor, which startled residents at 8.30am on Monday, is by far the largest recorded at the site and is bigger than the 2.3-magnitude quake that brought fracking to a halt in 2011.

We should not be being subjected to this level of stress and fear. Fracking must be stopped immediately.\u201d A spokesman for Frack Free Lancashire said: \u201cEnough is enough. People are cowering in their homes and just waiting and wondering when the next quake will be and how much damage it will cause. \u201cWe call upon our local MPs to come off the fence and press for an immediate ban on fracking. We are sick of being treated as human guinea pigs.\u201d The Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who represents the Fylde coast where the tremors were felt, said he would write to ministers to call for a halt to fracking in Lancashire. He said the latest tremors showed that the fracking industry is unable to operate within safety regulations, and added: \u201cIt is now clear that hydraulic fracturing is not suitable for Fylde or the people of Fylde and I will be writing to ministers and the Oil and Gas Authority to call for full cessation of the shale gas industry operating on the Fylde coast.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>No, it\u2019s not a type of canape. It\u2019s <em>Quichotte</em> as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/25/classics.miguelcervantes\" title=\"\"><em>Don Quixote</em></a>, Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s 17th-century proto-novel, here reimagined by Salman Rushdie as a 21st-century post-novel. Realism, apparently, is no longer up to the job of describing our nutzoid world. As one character suggests, \u201cthe surreal, or even the absurd, now offer the most accurate descriptors of real life\u201d.</p> <p>We\u2019re not in La Mancha any more but Trumpland. Our knight errant is a dapper old duffer named Ismail Smile who loses his job as a pharmaceutical salesman and sets off across America with a teenage son he has dreamed up named Sancho. Ismail hopes to win the heart of a young TV star named Salma, a fellow Indian-American, whose chatshow has made her \u201cOprah 2.0\u201d. He has never met her but he sends love letters under the pen name \u201cQuichotte\u201d, believing \u201clove will find a way\u201d of bringing them together.</p> <p>Just as Cervantes\u2019s <em>hidalgo</em> lost his mind after reading too many romances, so Quichotte has had his brain addled by trash TV. But even the most unlikely romance seems possible in the \u201cAge-of-Anything-Can-Happen\u201d. On their travels, Quichotte and Sancho duly encounter racists, opioids, humans who turn into mastodons, crickets who speak Italian and guns that talk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes, it reads like the work of a man trying to have the final word on everything before the world ends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But their quest is soon revealed as a story within a story, written by an Indian-born spy novelist as a late-in-life attempt at experimental fiction. The Author is tormented by his estrangement from his son and his lawyer sister, \u201cJack\u201d, who is dying of cancer in London. Rushdie argues that such broken migrant families are the \u201cbest mirrors of our times, shining shards that reflect the truth\u201d. Broken times they may be, but as India, America and Britain lurch to the right, their fates appear conjoined in a globalised world.</p> <p><em>Don Quixote</em> is often credited as the first realist novel in western literature. One of the tropes of the realist novel is the clash between illusions and reality \u2013 the individual who must adjust their ideals in order to live in the real world. But here, <em>Quichotte</em> must adjust to a post-truth world, where \u201cvisions and other phantasmagoria are to be expected\u201d.</p> <p>Rushdie\u2019s Booker-longlisted 14th novel is certainly the work of a frisky imagination. We end up in a literary hall of mirrors, as he flirts with every genre he\u2019s ever clapped eyes on, paying dues to <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Pinocchio, Ionesco\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2007/oct/03/ionescosrhinocerosisasrele\" title=\"\"><em>Rhinoceros</em></a> and Nabokov\u2019s <em>Lolita</em>.

      "bodyText": "No, it\u2019s not a type of canape. It\u2019s Quichotte as in Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s 17th-century proto-novel, here reimagined by Salman Rushdie as a 21st-century post-novel. Realism, apparently, is no longer up to the job of describing our nutzoid world. As one character suggests, \u201cthe surreal, or even the absurd, now offer the most accurate descriptors of real life\u201d. We\u2019re not in La Mancha any more but Trumpland. Our knight errant is a dapper old duffer named Ismail Smile who loses his job as a pharmaceutical salesman and sets off across America with a teenage son he has dreamed up named Sancho. Ismail hopes to win the heart of a young TV star named Salma, a fellow Indian-American, whose chatshow has made her \u201cOprah 2.0\u201d. He has never met her but he sends love letters under the pen name \u201cQuichotte\u201d, believing \u201clove will find a way\u201d of bringing them together. Just as Cervantes\u2019s hidalgo lost his mind after reading too many romances, so Quichotte has had his brain addled by trash TV. But even the most unlikely romance seems possible in the \u201cAge-of-Anything-Can-Happen\u201d. On their travels, Quichotte and Sancho duly encounter racists, opioids, humans who turn into mastodons, crickets who speak Italian and guns that talk. But their quest is soon revealed as a story within a story, written by an Indian-born spy novelist as a late-in-life attempt at experimental fiction. The Author is tormented by his estrangement from his son and his lawyer sister, \u201cJack\u201d, who is dying of cancer in London. Rushdie argues that such broken migrant families are the \u201cbest mirrors of our times, shining shards that reflect the truth\u201d. Broken times they may be, but as India, America and Britain lurch to the right, their fates appear conjoined in a globalised world. Don Quixote is often credited as the first realist novel in western literature. One of the tropes of the realist novel is the clash between illusions and reality \u2013 the individual who must adjust their ideals in order to live in the real world. But here, Quichotte must adjust to a post-truth world, where \u201cvisions and other phantasmagoria are to be expected\u201d. Rushdie\u2019s Booker-longlisted 14th novel is certainly the work of a frisky imagination. We end up in a literary hall of mirrors, as he flirts with every genre he\u2019s ever clapped eyes on, paying dues to Alice in Wonderland, Moby-Dick, Pinocchio, Ionesco\u2019s Rhinoceros and Nabokov\u2019s Lolita. The prose is dense with cultural allusions, too: Candy Crush Saga, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, the model Heidi Klum, Men in Black, etc. The novelist\u2019s natural bent has always been towards the encyclopedic, but now he has graduated from encyclopedia to Google. Quichotte ends up suffering from a kind of internetitis, Rushdie swollen with the junk culture he intended to critique. At times, he sounds like your dad reciting hip-hop: \u201cWe don\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 allies cause we\u2019re stupid and you can suck our dicks\u2026 We\u2019re America, bitch.\u201d More often, his references feel dated. When Salma tries an opioid spray for the first time, it\u2019s like \u201cgraduating to a Rolls-Royce after years spent behind a Nissan Qashqai. It was colour after a lifetime of black-and-white, Monroe after Mansfield, Margaux after Hobnob, Cervantes after Avellaneda, Hammett after Spillane\u2026\u201d While Quichotte is funny, it\u2019s rarely as funny as Rushdie thinks it is. Sometimes, it reads like the work of a man trying to have the final word on everything before the world ends. Or at least before he ends. Still, even if you feel overwhelmed, you can\u2019t help being charmed by Rushdie\u2019s largesse. Let\u2019s not get into whether the four-times divorced novelist who drooled over various \u201chot\u201d women in his memoir is a bit of a horn dog. Let\u2019s just say he is. But he is also the best of his generation at writing women. Both Salma and Jack are witty, opinionated and complex. When the Author tells Jack that he\u2019s writing about an ageing man who becomes obsessed with a younger TV star, she says: \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you are capable of sending yourself up.\u201d After, he makes \u201cthe usual literary protest, he isn\u2019t me, he\u2019s fictional\u201d and she replies: \u201cIt\u2019s better if I think you\u2019re lampooning yourself.

His blood test came back with low testosterone levels. \u201cWe went to see a urologist and he said bluntly that we wouldn\u2019t have any options to have kids with my sperm \u2013 we would have to use a donor or adopt,\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife immediately burst into tears.\u201d The couple had been trying for a child since they married in 2015.

Affecting about one in 600 men, it is one of the most common genetic conditions in the UK, yet most people have never heard of it \u2013 including many who have it. Its symptoms \u2013 extra height, persistent tiredness, reduced bodily hair and small testes \u2013 can be difficult to identify, meaning it often goes unnoticed by patients and GPs. Untreated, however, it can lead to reduced testosterone and infertility, and even increased prevalence of testicular cancer.</p> <p>The non-hereditary syndrome was first discovered in 1942. It is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome, resulting in XXY, as opposed to XY.

Having all these specialists in one place also means we can develop new research and methods of better administering testosterone. These men and their partners shouldn\u2019t have to live in such uncertainty.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Antoine Griezmann had watched the best and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/02/france-antoine-griezmann-euro-2016\">wanted to do what they do</a>. And so, when the ball came to him just to the right side of the area 50 minutes into his Camp Nou debut for Barcelona, he did. Pausing for a moment, he looked up and curled it into the corner, bending past the goalkeeper\u2019s hand and in by the post. If the shot was familiar, the foot wasn\u2019t. \u201cI see Messi do it in training and I copied him,\u201d the Frenchman said afterwards. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/16/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-match-report\">Beaten in Bilbao</a> on the opening night, Barcelona had been 1-0 down to Betis, darkness descending, doubts deepening, judgments served and sentences signed, but now he\u2019d scored twice to lead them into the light. All the pressure, gone. And a little more emulation to come.</p> \n<p>When he scored the first, sliding in to volley Sergi Roberto\u2019s delivery, Griezmann had clenched his fists, booted the ball into the air, and headed back to the centre, letting it out and urging them on. He\u2019d promised a special celebration for his first Camp Nou goal, saying he had a surprise for them, but with the game in the balance the time wasn\u2019t right, not yet; when he got his second, 2-1 up, on course for a victory which changed everything, it was. \u201cIf I have to say sorry, I\u2019ll do it on the pitch,\u201d he\u2019d insisted at his presentation, aware that he hadn\u2019t exactly arrived with everyone\u2019s blessing. By 10.15pm on Sunday night he\u2019d done that, forgiveness granted fast. Time to fulfil a promise. He\u2019d been planning this for a while.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/barcelona-real-betis-match-report\">Griezmann nets double in Barcelona\u2019s comeback win over Real Betis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d Griezmann said after two goals and an assist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/barcelona-real-betis-match-report\">had given Barcelona a 5-2 win</a>, after a performance in which, without Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez or Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, without Neymar either, he had taken centre stage and taken responsibility too, and he couldn\u2019t do this alone either. Aviv Levy Shoshan was standing in the corner at the north end in a blue bib, holding a small metal container. Griezmann knew where to find him and, as he headed over, Aviv took the lid off and poured the contents into the striker\u2019s hands. Hundreds of tiny red and blue stars, Barcelona confetti. Griezmann stood before the fans, and the cameras, and tossed them in the air, opening his arms wide, red and blue falling round him like purple rain.</p> \n<p>It was nowhere near his best celebration \u2013 that will forever be the day he leapt over the advertising boards and climbed behind the wheel of a car parked on the running track at Anoeta, teammates excitedly piling in, waving and grinning like they\u2019d just won Family Fortunes \u2013 but that was the front pages done. It also meant something. \u201cHow nice it is to score at the Camp Nou. Thanks for your support, cul\u00e9s. May our colours shine!\u201d he tweeted. Obsessed with the NBA, inspiration had come from his real idol: LeBron James \u2013 the man he\u2019d likened Messi to when he arrived, and the man he had previously compared with Cristiano Ronaldo. \u201cI liked his ritual and wanted to imitate it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The routine ran like this: before games, LeBron would dust his hands with chalk and then, standing in front of the fans, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1162771070786527232\">throw it in the air in a cloud of white</a>, like the puff of smoke from a magician. It became a signature move, iconic, part of the pre-match liturgy, a signal that it was time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1162771070786527232\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">LeBron's chalk toss will always be hype. \ud83d\udcaa<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TeamDay</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cavs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@cavs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/L4VW8F4xM9\">pic.twitter.com/L4VW8F4xM9</a></p>\u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1162771070786527232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>LeBron said he didn\u2019t really know why it became what it became, but he saw that it got everyone going and last night it got everyone going too. Not least Griezmann himself. If the cover of El Mundo Deportivo went for \u201cFestival Griezmann\u201d, Sport led on \u201cTake off\u201d. Inside, Marca led on \u201cBarcelona have a new hero\u201d. \u201cIn Griezmann\u2019s hands,\u201d said AS. \u201cIt\u2019s a special day for Griezmann,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said.</p> \n<p>He needed it. They all did. This is not the first time that Griezmann has copied LeBron. In 2018 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/atletico-madrid/1068/blog/post/3816800/griezmann-rejected-barca-once-but-as-atletis-season-slips-away-he-has-another-decision-to-make\">he filmed a documentary</a>, produced by Gerard Piqu\u00e9\u2019s company and called The Decision, in which he agonises over whether or not to join Barcelona from Atl\u00e9tico, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/12/miami-lebron-king-james-cleveland\">just as LeBron had done</a> when he left Cleveland for Miami. LeBron went; Griezmann didn\u2019t at first, although everything was set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/13/antoine-griezmann-transfer-barcelona-atletico-madrid-la-liga\">so that he could a year later for \u20ac120m</a>. The delay didn\u2019t please everyone; some didn\u2019t like the documentary and felt Griezmann had played Barcelona, insistent that he shouldn\u2019t be given a second chance. How could they sign someone who\u2019d turned them down \u2013 and made a TV show about it? Some supporters were unimpressed; some in the squad were too. Even after he arrived, there was the hint of rejection in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/barcelona/story/3899070/barcelona-finally-sign-griezmannwill-neymar-be-next-its-complicated\">the way </a><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/barcelona/story/3899070/barcelona-finally-sign-griezmannwill-neymar-be-next-its-complicated\">Barcelona pursued Neymar</a>, in the way Messi and Su\u00e1rez would like the Brazilian back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/itvfootball/status/1165753695944007680\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Highlights: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FCBarcelona</a> bounced back from opening day defeat emphatically with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealBetis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RealBetis</a> rout<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bar%C3%A7aBetis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bar\u00e7aBetis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/For%C3%A7aBar%C3%A7a?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#For\u00e7aBar\u00e7a</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuchoBetis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MuchoBetis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ITVLaLiga?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ITVLaLiga</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0aN8rWjOmz\">pic.twitter.com/0aN8rWjOmz</a></p>\u2014 ITV Football (@itvfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvfootball/status/1165753695944007680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 25, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>At his presentation, Griezmann said he could win them over with assists. If that was a recognition of hierarchy, an awareness of the care with which he may need to tread, Sunday\u2019s comment about copying Messi probably is too. And, unpacked, it poses questions which remain. This performance was hugely important, a release, but it doesn\u2019t resolve them; the context will not always be the same. How does Griezmann fit with Messi and Su\u00e1rez? <em>Where</em> does he fit with them? And if Neymar <em>does</em> come, what then? That felt unlikely here \u2013 inevitably, more wondered \u2018what for?\u2019 than before \u2013 but it\u2019s no guarantee. How will he respond when it\u2019s not on him? When he doesn\u2019t have the same freedom, his natural spaces off the front or the right likely occupied by the man he called \u201cfootball\u2019s LeBron\u201d? Will he lead? Will he be allowed to?</p> \n<p>Here, he did. Injured, Messi and Su\u00e1rez sat in the front row with their sons watching him. And the rest. As Sport\u2019s headline had it, led by Griezmann, they watched Barcelona take off. They saw the enthusiasm, the optimism return. They saw Barcelona press, high and hard, in a way they hadn\u2019t for months. They saw brilliant goals \u2013 both of Betis\u2019s were tasty too, although they probably didn\u2019t find the fact that they were scored by Fekir and Moron as funny as we do \u2013 and good news all over the pitch. Not just Griezmann but Sergio Busquets and Sergi Roberto, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 playing his 500th game, seven homegrown players, Carles P\u00e9rez scoring on his debut, coolly sliding the ball in. And Ansu Fati.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat were you doing at 16?\u201d someone asked on Sunday. Pretending to be 18, mostly. Ansu was running on the Camp Nou pitch, eyes wide, high-fiving people, smiling \u2013 the youngest Barcelona debutant for almost 80 years and the second youngest ever.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3068f35534a676e93c59e64e8184f7abcbe7c47\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3068f35534a676e93c59e64e8184f7abcbe7c47/0_169_4000_2498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ansu Fati, 16 years, nine months and 25 days old, during Barcelona\u2019s win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ansu Fati, 16 years, nine months and 25 days old, during Barcelona\u2019s win.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ansu arrived in Herrera, Seville, aged three, from Guinea Bissau. Barcelona signed him from Sevilla aged 11. A broken leg saw him miss six months. He\u2019d never even played in the B team before and had trained just three times with the first team. And yet here he was: at 16 years, nine months and 25 days. He hadn\u2019t eaten and hadn\u2019t slept, his dad told Cadena Ser radio. When he said he was joining the first team, the family thought he was joking. But now 10 of them sat in the Camp Nou, watching him run on. And if he looked overwhelmed then, as if this wasn\u2019t really happening, once he got there he played. And how. Quick, assured, willing. \u201cDaring,\u201d Valverde called him. One run and shot almost saw him begin with a goal, joy accompanying every move, like all was right with the world. And at the end, he didn\u2019t want to let go. \u201cI stayed out on the pitch because I couldn\u2019t believe it and I wanted to enjoy the moment,\u201d he admitted. When eventually he headed inside, Messi was waiting to embrace him.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can die a happy man,\u201d his dad said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cAnecd\u00f3tico,\u201d Julen Lopetegui called it, and he was right.

This time, it was 1-0 at recently-promoted Granada, whose manager Diego Mart\u00ednez insisted: \u201cWe looked them in the eye.\u201d They did too, but there\u2019s something about Sevilla.

Southgate will be back often. And why not? While Legan\u00e9s might not be that lovely, this is a great excuse to see Spain and a player who has impressed so far. Trippier began the move from which Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix provided a very neat assist for Vitolo to get the winner late in the second half \u2013 just when Atl\u00e9tico were starting to struggle. \u201cWe\u2019re not the \u2018people\u2019s team\u2019 any more because we have a stadium like that and we spent \u20ac126m on a player, but morally, emotionally, we still are,\u201d said Diego Simeone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1165790883163398145\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udcfa <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitoloMachin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VitoloMachin</a> gave <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atletienglish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@atletienglish</a> three points at Butarque!<br><br>Don't miss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeganesAtleti?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LeganesAtleti</a> highlights... <a href=\"https://t.co/JtcwEyS1Wa\">pic.twitter.com/JtcwEyS1Wa</a></p>\u2014 LaLiga (@LaLigaEN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1165790883163398145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 26, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Celta are fun. Valencia aren\u2019t. There\u2019s a crisis coming.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cBack to the past,\u201d the headline on the cover of Marca said after Real Madrid fielded a side made up entirely of players who were there at least three years ago, despite having spent \u20ac300m this summer. Oh, and after Real Madrid looked much like they did last year: lots of the ball but too few real chances. Those that did come were wasted. James and Bale, the two men Zidane wanted out, were back in the team and everyone looked the other way, whistled (or, more to the point, didn\u2019t whistle), and acted like none of that stuff had ever happened. Yet despite them, and them alone, seeming to take it in turns to take shots in the first half, the inevitable didn\u2019t happen. No narrative here. Instead, Madrid slipped, Valladolid grew and while Karim Benzema scored the opener, Sergi Guardiola got an impressive and possibly deserved equaliser with a couple of minutes left at the Bernab\u00e9u. The move started with Madrid losing possession. \u201cWe should have just hoofed it,\u201d Zidane moaned.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Speaking of record-breaking kids: Martin Odegaard scored for Real Sociedad.</p> \n<p>\u2022 0-1, 2-1 (and those two were penalties), 0-0, 1-1, 1-0, 1-1. 0-0, 0-1, 0-1 \u2026 it wasn\u2019t just Griezmann and Barcelona who needed that on Sunday; pretty much everyone else did too. A pretty dull weekend finally got a game to rescue it. Goals scored in open play at the Camp Nou: seven. Goals scored in open play in all the other games: nine. \u201cWe lacked football,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s said after Getafe\u2019s 1-1 draw with Athletic; \u201cit wasn\u2019t a game of excessive chances,\u201d said Athletic\u2019s Gaizka Garitano. Which summed it up quite nicely.

      "bodyText": "Antoine Griezmann had watched the best and wanted to do what they do. And so, when the ball came to him just to the right side of the area 50 minutes into his Camp Nou debut for Barcelona, he did. Pausing for a moment, he looked up and curled it into the corner, bending past the goalkeeper\u2019s hand and in by the post. If the shot was familiar, the foot wasn\u2019t. \u201cI see Messi do it in training and I copied him,\u201d the Frenchman said afterwards. Beaten in Bilbao on the opening night, Barcelona had been 1-0 down to Betis, darkness descending, doubts deepening, judgments served and sentences signed, but now he\u2019d scored twice to lead them into the light. All the pressure, gone. And a little more emulation to come. When he scored the first, sliding in to volley Sergi Roberto\u2019s delivery, Griezmann had clenched his fists, booted the ball into the air, and headed back to the centre, letting it out and urging them on. He\u2019d promised a special celebration for his first Camp Nou goal, saying he had a surprise for them, but with the game in the balance the time wasn\u2019t right, not yet; when he got his second, 2-1 up, on course for a victory which changed everything, it was. \u201cIf I have to say sorry, I\u2019ll do it on the pitch,\u201d he\u2019d insisted at his presentation, aware that he hadn\u2019t exactly arrived with everyone\u2019s blessing. By 10.15pm on Sunday night he\u2019d done that, forgiveness granted fast. Time to fulfil a promise. He\u2019d been planning this for a while. \u201cI can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d Griezmann said after two goals and an assist had given Barcelona a 5-2 win, after a performance in which, without Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez or Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, without Neymar either, he had taken centre stage and taken responsibility too, and he couldn\u2019t do this alone either. Aviv Levy Shoshan was standing in the corner at the north end in a blue bib, holding a small metal container. Griezmann knew where to find him and, as he headed over, Aviv took the lid off and poured the contents into the striker\u2019s hands. Hundreds of tiny red and blue stars, Barcelona confetti. Griezmann stood before the fans, and the cameras, and tossed them in the air, opening his arms wide, red and blue falling round him like purple rain. It was nowhere near his best celebration \u2013 that will forever be the day he leapt over the advertising boards and climbed behind the wheel of a car parked on the running track at Anoeta, teammates excitedly piling in, waving and grinning like they\u2019d just won Family Fortunes \u2013 but that was the front pages done. It also meant something. \u201cHow nice it is to score at the Camp Nou. Thanks for your support, cul\u00e9s. May our colours shine!\u201d he tweeted. Obsessed with the NBA, inspiration had come from his real idol: LeBron James \u2013 the man he\u2019d likened Messi to when he arrived, and the man he had previously compared with Cristiano Ronaldo. \u201cI liked his ritual and wanted to imitate it,\u201d he said. The routine ran like this: before games, LeBron would dust his hands with chalk and then, standing in front of the fans, throw it in the air in a cloud of white, like the puff of smoke from a magician. It became a signature move, iconic, part of the pre-match liturgy, a signal that it was time. LeBron said he didn\u2019t really know why it became what it became, but he saw that it got everyone going and last night it got everyone going too. Not least Griezmann himself. If the cover of El Mundo Deportivo went for \u201cFestival Griezmann\u201d, Sport led on \u201cTake off\u201d. Inside, Marca led on \u201cBarcelona have a new hero\u201d. \u201cIn Griezmann\u2019s hands,\u201d said AS. \u201cIt\u2019s a special day for Griezmann,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said. He needed it. They all did. This is not the first time that Griezmann has copied LeBron. In 2018 he filmed a documentary, produced by Gerard Piqu\u00e9\u2019s company and called The Decision, in which he agonises over whether or not to join Barcelona from Atl\u00e9tico, just as LeBron had done when he left Cleveland for Miami. LeBron went; Griezmann didn\u2019t at first, although everything was set so that he could a year later for \u20ac120m. The delay didn\u2019t please everyone; some didn\u2019t like the documentary and felt Griezmann had played Barcelona, insistent that he shouldn\u2019t be given a second chance. How could they sign someone who\u2019d turned them down \u2013 and made a TV show about it? Some supporters were unimpressed; some in the squad were too. Even after he arrived, there was the hint of rejection in the way Barcelona pursued Neymar, in the way Messi and Su\u00e1rez would like the Brazilian back. At his presentation, Griezmann said he could win them over with assists. If that was a recognition of hierarchy, an awareness of the care with which he may need to tread, Sunday\u2019s comment about copying Messi probably is too. And, unpacked, it poses questions which remain. This performance was hugely important, a release, but it doesn\u2019t resolve them; the context will not always be the same. How does Griezmann fit with Messi and Su\u00e1rez? Where does he fit with them? And if Neymar does come, what then? That felt unlikely here \u2013 inevitably, more wondered \u2018what for?\u2019 than before \u2013 but it\u2019s no guarantee. How will he respond when it\u2019s not on him? When he doesn\u2019t have the same freedom, his natural spaces off the front or the right likely occupied by the man he called \u201cfootball\u2019s LeBron\u201d? Will he lead? Will he be allowed to? Here, he did. Injured, Messi and Su\u00e1rez sat in the front row with their sons watching him. And the rest. As Sport\u2019s headline had it, led by Griezmann, they watched Barcelona take off. They saw the enthusiasm, the optimism return. They saw Barcelona press, high and hard, in a way they hadn\u2019t for months. They saw brilliant goals \u2013 both of Betis\u2019s were tasty too, although they probably didn\u2019t find the fact that they were scored by Fekir and Moron as funny as we do \u2013 and good news all over the pitch. Not just Griezmann but Sergio Busquets and Sergi Roberto, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 playing his 500th game, seven homegrown players, Carles P\u00e9rez scoring on his debut, coolly sliding the ball in. And Ansu Fati. \u201cWhat were you doing at 16?\u201d someone asked on Sunday. Pretending to be 18, mostly. Ansu was running on the Camp Nou pitch, eyes wide, high-fiving people, smiling \u2013 the youngest Barcelona debutant for almost 80 years and the second youngest ever. Ansu arrived in Herrera, Seville, aged three, from Guinea Bissau. Barcelona signed him from Sevilla aged 11. A broken leg saw him miss six months. He\u2019d never even played in the B team before and had trained just three times with the first team. And yet here he was: at 16 years, nine months and 25 days. He hadn\u2019t eaten and hadn\u2019t slept, his dad told Cadena Ser radio. When he said he was joining the first team, the family thought he was joking. But now 10 of them sat in the Camp Nou, watching him run on. And if he looked overwhelmed then, as if this wasn\u2019t really happening, once he got there he played. And how. Quick, assured, willing. \u201cDaring,\u201d Valverde called him. One run and shot almost saw him begin with a goal, joy accompanying every move, like all was right with the world. And at the end, he didn\u2019t want to let go. \u201cI stayed out on the pitch because I couldn\u2019t believe it and I wanted to enjoy the moment,\u201d he admitted. When eventually he headed inside, Messi was waiting to embrace him. \u201cI can die a happy man,\u201d his dad said. Talking points \u2022 \u201cAnecd\u00f3tico,\u201d Julen Lopetegui called it, and he was right. But still, two weeks into the season, his Sevilla side are top. Along with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, they\u2019re the only team in Spain to have won both games. This time, it was 1-0 at recently-promoted Granada, whose manager Diego Mart\u00ednez insisted: \u201cWe looked them in the eye.\u201d They did too, but there\u2019s something about Sevilla. Not perfect, not yet, but maybe something is building. \u2022 Gareth Southgate watched the cricket in his hotel and then headed south to Legan\u00e9s, taking up his seat in the directors\u2019 box with a notebook in hand, and watching another assured performance from Kieran Trippier and another 1-0 win for Atl\u00e9tico. Southgate will be back often. And why not? While Legan\u00e9s might not be that lovely, this is a great excuse to see Spain and a player who has impressed so far. Trippier began the move from which Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix provided a very neat assist for Vitolo to get the winner late in the second half \u2013 just when Atl\u00e9tico were starting to struggle. \u201cWe\u2019re not the \u2018people\u2019s team\u2019 any more because we have a stadium like that and we spent \u20ac126m on a player, but morally, emotionally, we still are,\u201d said Diego Simeone. \u2022 Celta are fun. Valencia aren\u2019t. There\u2019s a crisis coming. \u2022 \u201cBack to the past,\u201d the headline on the cover of Marca said after Real Madrid fielded a side made up entirely of players who were there at least three years ago, despite having spent \u20ac300m this summer. Oh, and after Real Madrid looked much like they did last year: lots of the ball but too few real chances. Those that did come were wasted. James and Bale, the two men Zidane wanted out, were back in the team and everyone looked the other way, whistled (or, more to the point, didn\u2019t whistle), and acted like none of that stuff had ever happened. Yet despite them, and them alone, seeming to take it in turns to take shots in the first half, the inevitable didn\u2019t happen. No narrative here. Instead, Madrid slipped, Valladolid grew and while Karim Benzema scored the opener, Sergi Guardiola got an impressive and possibly deserved equaliser with a couple of minutes left at the Bernab\u00e9u. The move started with Madrid losing possession. \u201cWe should have just hoofed it,\u201d Zidane moaned. \u2022 Speaking of record-breaking kids: Martin Odegaard scored for Real Sociedad. \u2022 0-1, 2-1 (and those two were penalties), 0-0, 1-1, 1-0, 1-1. 0-0, 0-1, 0-1 \u2026 it wasn\u2019t just Griezmann and Barcelona who needed that on Sunday; pretty much everyone else did too. A pretty dull weekend finally got a game to rescue it. Goals scored in open play at the Camp Nou: seven. Goals scored in open play in all the other games: nine. \u201cWe lacked football,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s said after Getafe\u2019s 1-1 draw with Athletic; \u201cit wasn\u2019t a game of excessive chances,\u201d said Athletic\u2019s Gaizka Garitano. Which summed it up quite nicely. As for Osasuna-Eibar, that was \u201cunsmokeable\u201d, they said.",

      "body": "<p>The European Union would refuse to negotiate a trade deal with the UK if the government reneged on the Brexit bill, EU sources have said.</p> \n<p>At the G7 summit in Biarritz, Boris Johnson said it was a \u201csimple statement of reality\u201d that in the event of no-deal Brexit the UK would withhold much of the \u00a339bn financial settlement agreed by Theresa May.</p> \n<p>Brussels sources have warned that future trade talks would be blocked until the UK agreed to a settlement.</p> \n<p>The financial settlement was a \u201ctotemic\u201d issue for EU member states, one official said. \u201cThe message will be \u2018honour your debts, or we are not even going to start talking about a trade deal,\u2019\u201d the source said, reflecting a widespread view among diplomats.</p> \n<p>Responding to the prime minister\u2019s comments, Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, tweeted: \u201cIf the UK refuses to pay its debts to the EU, then the EU will not accept to negotiate a trade agreement with the UK.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the painstakingly negotiated withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and the EU would collapse, including the transition period intended to smooth the way to the UK\u2019s new status. EU sources insist that the core provisions \u2013 money, citizens\u2019 rights and the Irish border \u2013 would have to be agreed as a precondition for opening talks on trade.</p> \n<p>But the UK government could also face fresh demands set by countries hit hard by a chaotic no deal. Diplomats expect that France and other coastal states would seek to make fisheries a key condition for unlocking talks on a future trade deal. \u201cThe EU reserves the right to extend the list\u201d of phase one issues, the source said. \u201cThe first contender will be fishing, as member states will be facing some very, very angry fishing communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fishing is one area where the EU stands to lose more than the UK from a no deal: EU-based fleets land about eight times as much fish from UK waters as British fishermen do in EU27 waters.</p> \n<p>But the UK would be under intense pressure from business to strike a trade deal with the EU, its largest trading partner. Britain does around <a href=\"file:///Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/CBP-7851.pdf\">half its trade with the EU</a> \u2013 the bloc accounts for 46% of UK exports and 54% of UK imports. At the weekend, Johnson insisted the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/25/britain-can-easily-cope-with-no-deal-brexit-claims-boris-johnson\">\u201ccan easily cope with a no-deal scenario\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Sources on both sides of the Brexit divide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/no-deal-brexit-rights-of-5-million-uk-and-eu-citizens-under-threat\">fear it could take a long time</a> to pick up the pieces of an acrimonious no-deal exit. Once the UK is outside the EU, any new agreement would have to be ratified by national parliaments, a process that could take years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69a89c5e-fe4c-40ec-b818-1b432b2a5bdc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbwXvNthZr0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The prime minister has insisted it is up to the EU27 to avert no deal. \u201cIf we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the \u00a339bn is no longer, strictly speaking, owed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities. It\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s a simple statement of reality.\u201d</p> \n<p>In reality, the \u00a339bn \u2013 a British calculation never confirmed by the EU \u2013 no longer exists. The figure was based a departure day of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/29/day-of-reckoning-what-the-papers-say-on-29-march-2019\">29 March</a>. As the UK remains a member of the EU, it has continued to pay into the EU budget, reducing its Brexit bill. The financial settlement consists of UK membership contributions until the end of 2020, as well as a British share of EU staff pensions and spending plans made by the EU28.</p> \n<p>The European commission chief spokesperson, Mina Andreeva, said that the UK would be expected to \u201ccontinue to honour all commitments made during in EU membership\u201d.</p> \n<p>She told journalists: \u201cRather than going now into a judicial action threat, I think that it is important to make clear that settling accounts is essential to starting off a new relationship on the right foot based on mutual trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson met the European council president, Donald Tusk, on Sunday in Biarritz but did not mention withholding part of the Brexit bill. </p>",

The financial settlement was a \u201ctotemic\u201d issue for EU member states, one official said. \u201cThe message will be \u2018honour your debts, or we are not even going to start talking about a trade deal,\u2019\u201d the source said, reflecting a widespread view among diplomats. Responding to the prime minister\u2019s comments, Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, tweeted: \u201cIf the UK refuses to pay its debts to the EU, then the EU will not accept to negotiate a trade agreement with the UK.\u201d In the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the painstakingly negotiated withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and the EU would collapse, including the transition period intended to smooth the way to the UK\u2019s new status. EU sources insist that the core provisions \u2013 money, citizens\u2019 rights and the Irish border \u2013 would have to be agreed as a precondition for opening talks on trade. But the UK government could also face fresh demands set by countries hit hard by a chaotic no deal. Diplomats expect that France and other coastal states would seek to make fisheries a key condition for unlocking talks on a future trade deal. \u201cThe EU reserves the right to extend the list\u201d of phase one issues, the source said. \u201cThe first contender will be fishing, as member states will be facing some very, very angry fishing communities.\u201d Fishing is one area where the EU stands to lose more than the UK from a no deal: EU-based fleets land about eight times as much fish from UK waters as British fishermen do in EU27 waters. But the UK would be under intense pressure from business to strike a trade deal with the EU, its largest trading partner. Britain does around half its trade with the EU \u2013 the bloc accounts for 46% of UK exports and 54% of UK imports. At the weekend, Johnson insisted the UK \u201ccan easily cope with a no-deal scenario\u201d. Sources on both sides of the Brexit divide fear it could take a long time to pick up the pieces of an acrimonious no-deal exit. Once the UK is outside the EU, any new agreement would have to be ratified by national parliaments, a process that could take years. The prime minister has insisted it is up to the EU27 to avert no deal. \u201cIf we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the \u00a339bn is no longer, strictly speaking, owed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities. It\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s a simple statement of reality.\u201d In reality, the \u00a339bn \u2013 a British calculation never confirmed by the EU \u2013 no longer exists. The figure was based a departure day of 29 March. As the UK remains a member of the EU, it has continued to pay into the EU budget, reducing its Brexit bill. The financial settlement consists of UK membership contributions until the end of 2020, as well as a British share of EU staff pensions and spending plans made by the EU28. The European commission chief spokesperson, Mina Andreeva, said that the UK would be expected to \u201ccontinue to honour all commitments made during in EU membership\u201d. She told journalists: \u201cRather than going now into a judicial action threat, I think that it is important to make clear that settling accounts is essential to starting off a new relationship on the right foot based on mutual trust.\u201d Johnson met the European council president, Donald Tusk, on Sunday in Biarritz but did not mention withholding part of the Brexit bill.",

      "bodyText": "Julie Bishop has said serving MPs and officials should be held responsible for not meeting with former ministers. In a submission to a Senate committee examining whether Bishop and Christopher Pyne breached ministerial standards by accepting post-retirement jobs relating to their former portfolios, the long-serving foreign minister claims the ministerial code of conduct would be \u201cmore workable and enforceable\u201d if it shifted the onus to those still accountable to parliament. \u201cThe onus could and arguably should be placed upon current serving officials to not hold meetings with former ministers for the period of 18 months after those ministers cease to hold office,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cCurrent ministers and government officials are subject to ongoing scrutiny through the parliament, including question time and Senate estimates, and by the media. \u201cThere is obvious redress available with regard to current serving ministers and officials, should they breach this protocol.\u201d Bishop has defended her role on the board of foreign aid firm Palladium, and says she remains in compliance with the code that prevents former ministers from lobbying or holding business meetings with members of the government, parliament, public service or defence force on any matter for which she held ministerial responsibility. She resigned as foreign minister in August 2018, and reminded the committee that she had not \u201cattended any meetings of the Morrison government cabinet\u201d. Bishop also gives an undertaking not to take personal advantage of information to which she had access as a minister, \u201cwhere that information is not generally available to the public\u201d. \u201cMy personal conduct since retiring from the Cabinet and the Parliament meets the requirement to be consistent with the dignity, reputation and integrity of the Parliament.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The submission comes ahead of a committee meeting on Friday that will hear from the outgoing head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson. Parkinson initially refused to appear before the committee after he conducted an inquiry into the potential breach by Bishop and Pyne and found no wrongdoing. But the chair of the committee, Jenny McAllister, insisted he appear, saying the \u201ccommittee has determined it has questions it wishes to ask you\u201d. \u201cIn any event, with respect, it is a matter for the committee to decide what evidence is relevant to its inquiry,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is therefore the committee\u2019s expectation that you will make yourself available to appear at a public hearing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asylum seekers held in a Papua New Guinean detention facility are being prevented from talking to lawyers and doctors, blocking them from medical evacuation to Australia approved under new medevac laws. David Manne, the executive director of Refugee Legal, told a Senate inquiry on Monday that he had lost contact with one client who had been approved for urgent evacuation weeks ago but was then detained at the Bomana detention facility in Papua New Guinea. Sara Townend, a doctor who has set up the process for medical assessment of people in PNG and Nauru, told the legal and constitutional affairs committee that two or three more were approved for evacuation after their detention and 33 have applications in progress, a \u201clarge number\u201d of who would be eligible for evacuation. Townend said the 53 asylum seekers detained at Bomana do not have access to their phones and the medical evacuation response group does not have a central phone number to have \u201capproved communications\u201d with them. Manne said the inability to contact his client was a matter of \u201cprofound concern\u201d. \u201cBeing detained after his approval for medical transfer is not only putting him in an extremely dangerous situation, but is also frustrating the ability to make good the decision \u2026 for evacuation,\u201d Manne said. Greens senator Nick McKim described it as \u201coutrageous\u201d that detention at the prison is frustrating medical evacuation. Home affairs department officials told the inquiry that Papua New Guinea had refused one man\u2019s medical transfer, citing the fact its medical services disagreed they were unable to treat him. In its submission, the home affairs department urged parliament to pass the Coalition\u2019s bill to repeal the medevac provisions, claiming provisions which give clinicians a greater say in the medical transfers undermine regional processing and impinge on the sovereignty of Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Pip De Veau, general counsel at the department, said the blocked transfer \u201chighlights the sovereignty point\u201d because it showed Australian doctors can order a transfer that \u201ccan\u2019t be given effect to because of the laws of another nation\u201d. Nauru has a record of blocking transfers. At the hearing, doctors responsible for the new medical transfer provisions rejected claims by the department that asylum seekers are resorting to self-harm because it is the most \u201cexpedient\u201d way out of detention. Kerryn Phelps \u2013 a doctor and former independent MP \u2013 told the inquiry that people in detention \u201care suffering, they\u2019re not trying to make a point, they\u2019re trying to kill themselves because they\u2019ve lost hope\u201d. The department reported that \u201csince late 2018, and through 2019, there has been an upwards trend in the number of self-harm related incidents amongst the Papua New Guinea cohort\u201d. \u201cNotably, self-harm incidents increased during the parliamentary debate on the [medevac provisions], and more significantly since the Australian federal election,\u201d it said. \u201cOf the 72 transitory persons transferred to Australia under the [medevac provisions], 39 had undertaken an act of self-harm and 19 had threatened self-harm since the implementation of the Act.\u201d Neela Janakiramanan, a Melbourne surgeon and one of the leading doctors implementing the medevac provisions, reported results of an audit of 581 people in detention that found that 97% have significant physical health issues and 91% have serious mental health issues. Mental health has \u201cnormal ebbs and flows\u201d, she said, but there \u201cis absolutely no evidence of an increase of self-harm behaviour since the implementation of the medevac bill\u201d. Between 1 March, when the new law came into force, and the election in mid-May rates of self-harm were \u201cactually extremely low\u201d. Janakiramanan said doctors had met the department in May and \u201cidentified that a Liberal win would destabilise the population of people who were overseas because of concerns that an ongoing Liberal government would not progress their applications for resettlement in a timely fashion\u201d. The home affairs submission rejected claims that it had been \u201clegally compelled to transfer persons from Nauru and Papua New Guinea to Australia to receive necessary health care\u201d before the medevac provisions. It cited more than 1,300 transferred under pre-existing provisions, compared to 112 under the new rules. Refugee and legal groups including the Human Rights Law Centre, Kaldor Centre and Refugee Legal described the previous system as \u201cinadequate\u201d. Graeme Edgerton, the deputy general counsel from the Australian Human Rights Commission, said from 2015 there was a \u201csharp reduction\u201d in medical transfers to Australia as a result of a new policy to send asylum seekers to third countries instead. Since March 2018 the federal court had ordered medical transfers in 96 cases and a further 220 people were transferred after threats of legal proceedings, he said. Edgerton said that 536 people were brought to Australia in 2018-19 and \u201capproximately 60% were transferred due to actual or prospective litigation\u201d, which \u201cstrongly indicates\u201d the previous regime was not sufficient to ensure proper care. Ed Santow, the Australian Human Rights commissioner, told the inquiry the repeal bill would \u201csignificantly limit\u201d refugees\u2019 and asylum seekers\u2019 \u201cright to the highest standard of physical and mental healthcare\u201d. Phelps and Santow both cited the case of Hamid Khazei, who died after delays and errors caused when the home affairs department refused a medical transfer for his leg infection. With Labor, the Greens and Centre Alliance opposed, the Coalition will need the vote of senator Jacqui Lambie to repeal the medevac provisions.",

      "bodyText": "The embattled union boss John Setka has hit out at the \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d attack on his position ahead of a court ruling on Tuesday that could sever his ties to the Labor party. In a statement issued with his wife, Emma Walters, on Monday, Setka blamed an \u201cindividual\u2019s political agenda\u201d for the attempt to unseat him as head of the construction union in Victoria. \u201cThe continued politically motivated attack on myself and the lack of support from some of my union counterparts is both disappointing and not in the spirit of unions, or the Australian way where everyone gets a fair go. \u201cThis is more about an individual\u2019s political agenda at the expense of my private life with no regard for my wife, and family. \u201cThe anonymous individual waging cowardly, politically motivated and personal attacks is the one who has no respect or concern for the damage he is causing the union.\u201d Setka was responding to a report in The Australian about a \u201cdissident group\u201d within the CFMEU who had circulated further allegations against Setka to party figures in what was seen as an attempt to \u201cblast him out\u201d of the role. Setka said that if the \u201crumours\u201d or allegations had been true, he would have been charged. The political infighting comes as the Victorian supreme court prepares to hand down its judgment on Tuesday on whether the Labor party acted lawfully when it expelled him from the party in July following a public statement from leader Anthony Albanese. Setka argued that Albanese and the party had denied him due process as the matter should have been dealt with by the Victorian branch\u2019s disputes tribunal. The move against the outspoken unionist from the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union has divided the union movement, with the ACTU boss Sally McManus calling for him to stand down while others have rallied behind him. At the Western Australian state Labor conference on Sunday, allies of Setka in the WA branch of the CFMEU and MUA sat in protest during a standing ovation for Albanese in what was seen as a rebuke of his handling of the Setka matter. Setka has pleaded guilty to harassing a woman by text messages, which was later revealed to be his wife. Walters will face court on Friday for a separate drink driving charge. In the joint statement Walters said that her family had endured \u201can incredibly difficult few years\u201d. \u201cI made it clear then as I am now, I was in a very dark place in which I did seek refuge with alcohol during that time and this is something I am not proud of. \u201cWe have together faced the court system in relation to our marriage breakdown and I will face the courts this Friday for a drink driving charge during the same period of which I am deeply ashamed.\u201d She said she and Setka had both sought professional help to rebuild their family life.",

      "body": "<p>In 1926, a young woman who liked to be known as Dod Procter \u2013 her name was actually Doris \u2013 submitted a painting to the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition. Entitled <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/procter-morning-n04270\" title=\"\"><em>Morning</em></a>, it depicted Cissie Barnes, the 16-year-old daughter of a Cornish fisherman, lying on a bed in her nightdress, sunlight falling on her bare arms and legs. A strikingly intimate picture \u2013 it speaks of dust motes and the smell of crumpled linen \u2013 this oil made Procter the most talked about artist in Britain, at least for a while. Public and critics alike thrilled to its intensity, and one of the latter, from the <em>Daily Mail</em>, would go on to buy it for the nation.</p> <p>But for the female artist, success was a more than usually complicated business. Two years later, another painting by Procter, <em>Virginal</em>, in which Cissie Barnes posed naked, was turned down by the Academy; there was, perhaps, something a little too graphic in the artist\u2019s depiction of her model\u2019s pubic hair. In the moment, such rejection mattered relatively little. Procter\u2019s fame only grew and in 1942 she became a full member of the Royal Academy, still a rare honour for a woman (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43243536\" title=\"\">Annie Swynnerton</a>, the first female RA member in its then 154-year history, was elected only in 1922). Nevertheless, in the context of her career, it appears as a dark arrow, pointing to the way her work would fall out of favour even in her own lifetime. Oh, Dod, one-time employee of the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/o/omega-workshops/story-omega-workshops\" title=\"\">Omega Workshops</a> and admirer of Picasso. How many people know your name now?</p> <p>Procter appears early on in <em>Voyaging Out</em>, Carolyn Trant\u2019s lavishly illustrated history of British female artists from suffrage to the 60s, and her story is in many ways representative. It isn\u2019t only that her prodigious talent was of so little use in the face of the male establishment; that <em>Virginal</em>, painted at a time when art schools were still segregated, when female models were often considered to be little better than prostitutes, and when the male models used by female students had to wear posing pouches, attracted the kind of salacious talk that male artists no longer had to deal with. What matters most is the question of her visibility.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gill was reluctant to sell her work in her lifetime because she believed it belonged to Myrninerest, her spirit medium</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That Trant needed to write this book at all \u2013 why does it not exist already? why must women artists still be clumped together in one great mass like this? \u2013 tells you everything you need to know about what her subjects had to put up with, from the shackles of domesticity, the needs of their often unsupportive and babyish partners, to the way they were excluded from the various art movements of their time (\u201clet\u2019s not have any of those damned women,\u201d said CRW Nevinson to Wyndham Lewis during a discussion of the latter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/r/rebel-art-centre\" title=\"\">Rebel Art Centre</a> \u2013 though both men were happy enough to accept the money of a woman, Kate Lechmere, to fund it).</p> <p>Trant\u2019s book is diligent, detailed and full of surprises: everyone is here, from the still celebrated (Sybil Andrews, Vanessa Bell, Barbara Hepworth) to the little known and the almost completely forgotten (Catherine Giles, Ithell Colquhoun, Cecile Walton). She pays attention not only to these women\u2019s lives and work \u2013 carefully balancing the two \u2013 but makes room, too, for their weirdnesses and quirks: here are occultists and outsiders, crafters and cross-dressers. I spent several minutes staring at the marvellous photograph she includes of the self-taught <a href=\"http://madgegill.com/\" title=\"\">Madge Gill</a> displaying a 4.5m calico drape mural in the front room of her London home in 1947; Gill was reluctant to sell her work in her lifetime because she believed it all belonged to Myrninerest, her spirit medium.</p> <p>Inevitably, a book like this is unsatisfying to a degree. Trant set herself a huge task in covering such a long period of time, one that takes in two wars. Occasionally, her narrative has the feeling of a list; sometimes she tells when she should show (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/09/sex-and-art-by-the-grand-canal-how-peggy-guggenheim-took-venice\" title=\"\">Peggy Guggenheim</a> \u201cencountered misogyny wherever she went\u201d, she says of the great gallerist and collector, without giving us any examples). But it also sends you away determined to find out more. Who knew, to take just one example, that the constructivist Marlow Moss, long consigned to a minor role in art history, may have influenced her friend Mondrian as much as he did her? In this sense, <em>Voyaging Out</em> bulges with hope for the future: for more research, for more books and, above all, for more inclusive and wide-reaching shows.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Voyaging Out: British Women Artists from Suffrage to the Sixties</em> by Carolyn Trant is published by Thames &amp; Hudson (\u00a324.95).

That Trant needed to write this book at all \u2013 why does it not exist already? why must women artists still be clumped together in one great mass like this? \u2013 tells you everything you need to know about what her subjects had to put up with, from the shackles of domesticity, the needs of their often unsupportive and babyish partners, to the way they were excluded from the various art movements of their time (\u201clet\u2019s not have any of those damned women,\u201d said CRW Nevinson to Wyndham Lewis during a discussion of the latter\u2019s Rebel Art Centre \u2013 though both men were happy enough to accept the money of a woman, Kate Lechmere, to fund it). Trant\u2019s book is diligent, detailed and full of surprises: everyone is here, from the still celebrated (Sybil Andrews, Vanessa Bell, Barbara Hepworth) to the little known and the almost completely forgotten (Catherine Giles, Ithell Colquhoun, Cecile Walton). She pays attention not only to these women\u2019s lives and work \u2013 carefully balancing the two \u2013 but makes room, too, for their weirdnesses and quirks: here are occultists and outsiders, crafters and cross-dressers. I spent several minutes staring at the marvellous photograph she includes of the self-taught Madge Gill displaying a 4.5m calico drape mural in the front room of her London home in 1947; Gill was reluctant to sell her work in her lifetime because she believed it all belonged to Myrninerest, her spirit medium. Inevitably, a book like this is unsatisfying to a degree. Trant set herself a huge task in covering such a long period of time, one that takes in two wars. Occasionally, her narrative has the feeling of a list; sometimes she tells when she should show (Peggy Guggenheim \u201cencountered misogyny wherever she went\u201d, she says of the great gallerist and collector, without giving us any examples). But it also sends you away determined to find out more. Who knew, to take just one example, that the constructivist Marlow Moss, long consigned to a minor role in art history, may have influenced her friend Mondrian as much as he did her? In this sense, Voyaging Out bulges with hope for the future: for more research, for more books and, above all, for more inclusive and wide-reaching shows. \u2022 Voyaging Out: British Women Artists from Suffrage to the Sixties by Carolyn Trant is published by Thames &amp; Hudson (\u00a324.95).

She couldn\u2019t afford the $1,500 she would need for bail.

It hit their school bus. As CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/17/middleeast/us-saudi-yemen-bus-strike-intl/index.html\">reported</a> the \u201c500-pound laser-guided MK 82 bomb\u201d was made by Lockheed Martin. A BBC reporter posted a picture of what was left of their belongings to Twitter and the image is an array of bright blue Unicef backpacks strewn along the ground splattered with blood.</p> <p>On a Wednesday, a man named Joel Arrona-Lara was <a href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/man-arrested-while-taking-pregnant-wife-to-hospital-wanted-for-murder-ice-says/3995760/\">seized by Ice</a> while stopped at a gas station in San Bernadino. He was in the process of bringing his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth. The agents left her to fend for herself and the aftermath was caught on the security camera of the gas station. She\u2019s crying and distraught and very very pregnant standing there next to the Doritos and shit. \u201cMom forced to deliver without dad\u201d the chyron on CBS LA read.</p> <p>That same week a Houston doctor was sentenced to ten years\u2019 probation after being convicted of <a href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2018/08/19/a-jury-convicted-a-doctor-of-raping-a-patient-at-a-hospital-and-sentenced-him-to-probation/\">raping a sedated patient</a> in her hospital bed who was there after experiencing a severe asthma attack. Shafeeq Sheikh lost his medical license but would serve no time. \u201cTestifying in Spanish through an interpreter, the former patient said in the early morning of Nov 2, 2013, she awoke to find a man at her bedside in a white doctor\u2019s coat saying he needed to examine her. He pushed up her gown and touched her breasts in an \u2018ugly way,\u2019 and she pushed the call button repeatedly, she said. Witnesses testified that it had been unplugged from the wall,\u201d the Houston Chronicle reported.</p> <p>Sheikh testified that the sex had been consensual saying that she was the instigator and then his lawyer showed the jury images from Laura\u2019s Instagram where she had posted a number of \u201csexy\u201d photos as part of her job promoting a clothing boutique which is the universal signal that we all understand which means it\u2019s OK to rape someone. \u201cHe made a mistake, but he didn\u2019t sexually assault her,\u201d his attorney Lisa Andrews <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/claudiakoerner/a-texas-doctor-will-not-serve-jail-time-after-raping-a\">argued</a>. \u201cHere we have this Latina woman with her fake boobs that came onto that little nerdy middle-aged guy, and he lost his mind.\u201d</p> <p>Every so often a poll will come out that says something like 3% of respondents had \u201clittle to no awareness of Donald Trump\u201d and we tend to scoff in amusement at that sort of thing like, lol, must be nice. But I wonder sometimes about those people \u2013 those beautiful, smooth-brained and innocent children of god \u2013 whether or not they\u2019re on to something the rest of us aren\u2019t.</p> <p>Most people do not attend hourly to the sins of the world in its perpetual cycle of grief and misery on Twitter. Most people have better things to do with their lives than read 10,000 posts. Presumably, if you are reading this you trend toward the heavier news diet than most if not quite on the Clockwork Orange eyeball torture feed I, a writer, subsist on. I wonder if there\u2019s a better way to live without abstaining from the feed entirely? What exactly is it we\u2019re doing, those of us who scroll through our newsfeed endlessly like an addict lifelessly pulling the lever on a slot machine waiting for information and sadness to spill out?</p> <p>Certainly there are ways to effect change in the world \u2013 taking to the streets, protesting, boycotts, pressuring your representatives, helping register people to vote \u2013 but those of us on the barricades of the news cycle sometimes delude and flatter ourselves that by paying vigilant witness, we\u2019re performing some necessary function.</p> <p>Sometimes I think that I, like the destitute sin-eaters, behold the grief of the world without respite because I have no other choice. Each sin I consume I can turn into a living. Much like them, it\u2019s a paltry one to be sure and we writers and journalists are not much respected either.</p> <p>Other times I think a lot of us \u2013 and this includes myself \u2013 tend to be more like ol\u2019 Bobby Munslow. We\u2019ve been driven mad with grief and we know nothing else but to continue to compound it in a gluttonous feast. We gorge ourselves on the sins of others until it sickens us hoping without any sort of reliable proof that in the end it might help someone but knowing nonetheless that it won\u2019t.</p> <p><em>Adapted from Luke O\u2019Neils newsletter <a href=\"https://luke.substack.com/\">Welcome to Hell World</a> and the <a href=\"https://orbooks.com/catalog/welcome-to-hell-world\">forthcoming book</a> of the same name.</em></p>",

On a Tuesday, a woman being held in jail in Texas killed herself. She couldn\u2019t afford the $1,500 she would need for bail. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe for Peter Strzok, a very well-off cop who lost his job for being rude to the president, had raised almost $450,000 in less than a week. On a Friday, dozens of Yemeni children were bombed to their deaths by a missile fired by the Saudi-led and US-supported coalition. It hit their school bus. As CNN reported the \u201c500-pound laser-guided MK 82 bomb\u201d was made by Lockheed Martin. A BBC reporter posted a picture of what was left of their belongings to Twitter and the image is an array of bright blue Unicef backpacks strewn along the ground splattered with blood. On a Wednesday, a man named Joel Arrona-Lara was seized by Ice while stopped at a gas station in San Bernadino. He was in the process of bringing his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth. The agents left her to fend for herself and the aftermath was caught on the security camera of the gas station. She\u2019s crying and distraught and very very pregnant standing there next to the Doritos and shit. \u201cMom forced to deliver without dad\u201d the chyron on CBS LA read. That same week a Houston doctor was sentenced to ten years\u2019 probation after being convicted of raping a sedated patient in her hospital bed who was there after experiencing a severe asthma attack. Shafeeq Sheikh lost his medical license but would serve no time. \u201cTestifying in Spanish through an interpreter, the former patient said in the early morning of Nov 2, 2013, she awoke to find a man at her bedside in a white doctor\u2019s coat saying he needed to examine her. He pushed up her gown and touched her breasts in an \u2018ugly way,\u2019 and she pushed the call button repeatedly, she said. Witnesses testified that it had been unplugged from the wall,\u201d the Houston Chronicle reported. Sheikh testified that the sex had been consensual saying that she was the instigator and then his lawyer showed the jury images from Laura\u2019s Instagram where she had posted a number of \u201csexy\u201d photos as part of her job promoting a clothing boutique which is the universal signal that we all understand which means it\u2019s OK to rape someone. \u201cHe made a mistake, but he didn\u2019t sexually assault her,\u201d his attorney Lisa Andrews argued. \u201cHere we have this Latina woman with her fake boobs that came onto that little nerdy middle-aged guy, and he lost his mind.\u201d Every so often a poll will come out that says something like 3% of respondents had \u201clittle to no awareness of Donald Trump\u201d and we tend to scoff in amusement at that sort of thing like, lol, must be nice. But I wonder sometimes about those people \u2013 those beautiful, smooth-brained and innocent children of god \u2013 whether or not they\u2019re on to something the rest of us aren\u2019t. Most people do not attend hourly to the sins of the world in its perpetual cycle of grief and misery on Twitter. Most people have better things to do with their lives than read 10,000 posts. Presumably, if you are reading this you trend toward the heavier news diet than most if not quite on the Clockwork Orange eyeball torture feed I, a writer, subsist on. I wonder if there\u2019s a better way to live without abstaining from the feed entirely? What exactly is it we\u2019re doing, those of us who scroll through our newsfeed endlessly like an addict lifelessly pulling the lever on a slot machine waiting for information and sadness to spill out? Certainly there are ways to effect change in the world \u2013 taking to the streets, protesting, boycotts, pressuring your representatives, helping register people to vote \u2013 but those of us on the barricades of the news cycle sometimes delude and flatter ourselves that by paying vigilant witness, we\u2019re performing some necessary function. Sometimes I think that I, like the destitute sin-eaters, behold the grief of the world without respite because I have no other choice. Each sin I consume I can turn into a living. Much like them, it\u2019s a paltry one to be sure and we writers and journalists are not much respected either. Other times I think a lot of us \u2013 and this includes myself \u2013 tend to be more like ol\u2019 Bobby Munslow. We\u2019ve been driven mad with grief and we know nothing else but to continue to compound it in a gluttonous feast. We gorge ourselves on the sins of others until it sickens us hoping without any sort of reliable proof that in the end it might help someone but knowing nonetheless that it won\u2019t.

It\u2019s going to be about race and immigration and deportation and Israel and every other wedge issue Donald Trump can summon to split the vote into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. He will become Chief Native, swelling his supporters\u2019 sense of dominion over others less white. The campaign has already started; his social media presence has gone from ungainly swiping to a more coherent regular punching. He has in effect launched a cyber-bullying offensive.</p> <p>Trump will reduce people to tears, from <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zYANRUos8Hg\" title=\"\">black TV anchors</a> worn down by his racist attacks to <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wklaamUI528\" title=\"\">Rashida Tlaib</a>, reeling from the unexpected emotional shock of her Palestinian grandmother being dragged in the mud of Trump\u2019s bear pit.

What was a prominent theme in the 2016 campaign, going after Muslims and immigrants, will become the only theme.</p> <p>It might appear to be an unprecedented escalation, but Trump is only the latest Republican politician to leverage white identity politics for electoral gain, the only difference, as with everything else that sets him apart from his predecessors, is that he is not intelligent enough to do it subtly.</p> <p>There really are no more excuses. A Trump voter in 2020 is a voter who can no longer plausibly pretend, to themselves or others, that their reasons are down to economic anxiety or some \u201cleft behind\u201d resentment. Yet these excuses will be rolled out anyway, so established are the patterns that let voters off the hook for supporting racial supremacy. In 1990, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, David Duke, ran for Senate in Louisiana and secured 43% of the vote. One could not distinguish between the justifications for voting for Duke then and the reasons white people voted for Trump in 2016: a working-class post-recession revolt; an angry message from the disenfranchised to the elites of Washington.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17ef860053ff8be259e88d696897d20fb37feb47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17ef860053ff8be259e88d696897d20fb37feb47/0_112_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US representatives Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Squad\u2019: (left to right) US representatives Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin Scott/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Duke only lost because black people voted overwhelmingly against him. The same happened almost 30 years later when Roy Moore, Alabama\u2019s Republican candidate for the US Senate, ran what the Washington Post called a \u201cwhite populist\u201d campaign. Moore romanticised the era of slavery, referred to Native Americans and Asian Americans as \u201creds and yellows\u201d, questioned whether former president Barack Obama had been born in the US and argued that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/roy-moore-defeat-trump-future-republican-party-trumpism\" title=\"\">He was thwarted</a>, because black people voted against him.</p> <p>Despite this history, the Democrats are still not ready. They are still unable to fully engage in the looming identity wars of 2020. Trump\u2019s entire political strategy has become reduced to identity politics not only because he is incapable of anything more sophisticated, but also because it gets results. The leftwing establishment (for so long accused of playing the identity politics card) is taking the blows passively, having internalised the largely baseless accusations that it is out in the wilderness because its message was too focused on minorities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/19/donald-trump-2020-squad-ilhan-omar\">Trump wants to run against the Squad. Democrats must stay united | Lloyd Green</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This might have been true at some point, when there were big electoral gains to be made after the 1960s when discreet marginalised groups became identifiable as voting blocks and the left wooed them. But lately the left\u2019s overtures towards those groups have been mainly to make the right noises and take them for granted. The result was that in 2016, the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\" title=\"\">black voter turnout rate dropped for the first time in 20 years</a> in a presidential election. The 7% fall was the largest ever recorded for that demographic.</p> <p>There is no success in political battle more unequivocal than convincing your opponent that they are wrong. The right has managed to succeed not only in persuading voters that the left is obsessed and distracted by identity politics at their expense, but in planting this seed of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/hillary-clinton-europe-must-curb-immigration-stop-populists-trump-brexit\" title=\"\">self-doubt in the minds of left</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/hillary-clinton-europe-must-curb-immigration-stop-populists-trump-brexit\" title=\"\">wing politicians themselves</a>.

The only acceptable way to wield racial politics these days is against its victims, rather than in their defence.</p> <p>The hesitation is everywhere, from the Democratic party leadership\u2019s reluctance to weigh in forcefully enough in defence of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/the-squad-name-origins-aoc-ilhan-omar-ayanna-pressley-rashida-tlaib\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/the-squad-name-origins-aoc-ilhan-omar-ayanna-pressley-rashida-tlaib\" title=\"\">Squad</a>\u201d \u2013 four congresswomen of colour targeted by Trump, or \u201cfour people\u201d who \u201cdidn\u2019t have any following\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/us/politics/aoc-squad-pelosi.html\" title=\"\">according to House speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> \u2013 to the liberal media\u2019s pearl-clutching at calling Trump racist (\u201c<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/14/media/new-york-times-criticism/index.html\">We are not fucking part of the resistance</a>,\u201d according to a New York Times staffer). The mainstream American left is hamstrung by a misplaced sense of decorum and fixated on an outdated view that tackling the Trump assault head-on is somehow \u201cradical\u201d, a strategy that will dent the Democrats\u2019 ability to win due to a loss of \u201cmoderates\u201d. All this despite the fact that the whole \u201cwhen they go low we go high\u201d approach didn\u2019t work out so well in 2016.</p> <p>And it won\u2019t work this time either. The left must dive into the identity politics pool, convert the jaded and make a pitch for the soul of those Trump\u2019s vision has captured by showing how his incendiary politics makes the world less safe for everyone. Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it works. And because there really isn\u2019t much of a choice any more. A <a href=\"https://crooked.com/articles/pollercoaster-2020-whats-happening-wisconsin/\" title=\"\">recent poll showed that independents in Wisconsin</a> (a crucial swing state won by Trump three years ago) cite \u201cimmigration\u201d as their top electoral issue.</p> <p>For those crucial defecting Democratic voters (about a third of Obama-voting counties <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/obama-trump-swing-voters.html\" title=\"\">flipped for Trump</a> in 2016), there are already signs that the \u201cchange\u201d candidate they saw in Trump has not delivered. This cohort will be even more susceptible to being won back by a Democratic party pitching in a positive, explicitly inclusive way, rather than fixating on Trump\u2019s failures. Inspiring emotion is often more effective than delivering information. When the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/obama-trump-swing-voters.html\" title=\"\">New York Times canvassed </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/obama-trump-swing-voters.html\" title=\"\">voters in Ohio</a>, the big takeaway was: \u201cSeveral voters said they chose Mr Trump for the same reason they chose Mr Obama: a deep craving for change.\u201d</p> <p>The evidence this approach works is Trump himself, a man who has nothing to offer but a coherent vision of the future. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RJhTDeFo7E\" title=\"\">recent interview Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez</a> said: \u201cWhether you like it or whether you hate it, a wall is a vision, it\u2019s a tangible vision that is symbolic and representative and galvanising. And if we do not have an ambitious, inspiring, galvanising vision, I think we risk losing even more.\u201d</p> <p>To prepare for 2020 the Democrats must hold their noses and wade into the immigration and race melee. They must do it with conviction, consistency and emotional resonance, rather than with a sort of competent, managerial presence that frowns upon engaging with Trump on his own terms as unruly. Being reactive and \u201cfact-checking\u201d Trump can only get us so far. The fight must be both dirty and inspiring. It needs to get to a point where a Democratic presidential candidate can say: \u201cThe longer Trump and the Republicans talk about identity politics, I got \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

He will become Chief Native, swelling his supporters\u2019 sense of dominion over others less white. The campaign has already started; his social media presence has gone from ungainly swiping to a more coherent regular punching. He has in effect launched a cyber-bullying offensive. Trump will reduce people to tears, from black TV anchors worn down by his racist attacks to Rashida Tlaib, reeling from the unexpected emotional shock of her Palestinian grandmother being dragged in the mud of Trump\u2019s bear pit. He will tell Jews how to vote and nurture antisemitism while pretending to give a damn about Israel so that he can smear Muslim opponents. What was a prominent theme in the 2016 campaign, going after Muslims and immigrants, will become the only theme. It might appear to be an unprecedented escalation, but Trump is only the latest Republican politician to leverage white identity politics for electoral gain, the only difference, as with everything else that sets him apart from his predecessors, is that he is not intelligent enough to do it subtly. There really are no more excuses. A Trump voter in 2020 is a voter who can no longer plausibly pretend, to themselves or others, that their reasons are down to economic anxiety or some \u201cleft behind\u201d resentment. Yet these excuses will be rolled out anyway, so established are the patterns that let voters off the hook for supporting racial supremacy. In 1990, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, David Duke, ran for Senate in Louisiana and secured 43% of the vote. One could not distinguish between the justifications for voting for Duke then and the reasons white people voted for Trump in 2016: a working-class post-recession revolt; an angry message from the disenfranchised to the elites of Washington. Duke only lost because black people voted overwhelmingly against him. The same happened almost 30 years later when Roy Moore, Alabama\u2019s Republican candidate for the US Senate, ran what the Washington Post called a \u201cwhite populist\u201d campaign. Moore romanticised the era of slavery, referred to Native Americans and Asian Americans as \u201creds and yellows\u201d, questioned whether former president Barack Obama had been born in the US and argued that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He was thwarted, because black people voted against him. Despite this history, the Democrats are still not ready. They are still unable to fully engage in the looming identity wars of 2020. Trump\u2019s entire political strategy has become reduced to identity politics not only because he is incapable of anything more sophisticated, but also because it gets results. The leftwing establishment (for so long accused of playing the identity politics card) is taking the blows passively, having internalised the largely baseless accusations that it is out in the wilderness because its message was too focused on minorities. This might have been true at some point, when there were big electoral gains to be made after the 1960s when discreet marginalised groups became identifiable as voting blocks and the left wooed them. But lately the left\u2019s overtures towards those groups have been mainly to make the right noises and take them for granted. The result was that in 2016, the black voter turnout rate dropped for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election. The 7% fall was the largest ever recorded for that demographic. There is no success in political battle more unequivocal than convincing your opponent that they are wrong. The right has managed to succeed not only in persuading voters that the left is obsessed and distracted by identity politics at their expense, but in planting this seed of self-doubt in the minds of leftwing politicians themselves. Steve Bannon summed this up. He couldn\u2019t \u201cget enough\u201d of the left\u2019s \u201crace-identity politics\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer they talk about identity politics, I got \u2019em \u2026 I want them to talk about race and identity \u2026 every day.\u201d Only Trump is allowed to talk about race and identity every day. The only acceptable way to wield racial politics these days is against its victims, rather than in their defence. The hesitation is everywhere, from the Democratic party leadership\u2019s reluctance to weigh in forcefully enough in defence of \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2013 four congresswomen of colour targeted by Trump, or \u201cfour people\u201d who \u201cdidn\u2019t have any following\u201d, according to House speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 to the liberal media\u2019s pearl-clutching at calling Trump racist (\u201cWe are not fucking part of the resistance,\u201d according to a New York Times staffer). The mainstream American left is hamstrung by a misplaced sense of decorum and fixated on an outdated view that tackling the Trump assault head-on is somehow \u201cradical\u201d, a strategy that will dent the Democrats\u2019 ability to win due to a loss of \u201cmoderates\u201d. All this despite the fact that the whole \u201cwhen they go low we go high\u201d approach didn\u2019t work out so well in 2016. And it won\u2019t work this time either. The left must dive into the identity politics pool, convert the jaded and make a pitch for the soul of those Trump\u2019s vision has captured by showing how his incendiary politics makes the world less safe for everyone. Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it works. And because there really isn\u2019t much of a choice any more. A recent poll showed that independents in Wisconsin (a crucial swing state won by Trump three years ago) cite \u201cimmigration\u201d as their top electoral issue. For those crucial defecting Democratic voters (about a third of Obama-voting counties flipped for Trump in 2016), there are already signs that the \u201cchange\u201d candidate they saw in Trump has not delivered. This cohort will be even more susceptible to being won back by a Democratic party pitching in a positive, explicitly inclusive way, rather than fixating on Trump\u2019s failures. Inspiring emotion is often more effective than delivering information. When the New York Times canvassed voters in Ohio, the big takeaway was: \u201cSeveral voters said they chose Mr Trump for the same reason they chose Mr Obama: a deep craving for change.\u201d The evidence this approach works is Trump himself, a man who has nothing to offer but a coherent vision of the future. In a recent interview Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cWhether you like it or whether you hate it, a wall is a vision, it\u2019s a tangible vision that is symbolic and representative and galvanising. And if we do not have an ambitious, inspiring, galvanising vision, I think we risk losing even more.\u201d To prepare for 2020 the Democrats must hold their noses and wade into the immigration and race melee. They must do it with conviction, consistency and emotional resonance, rather than with a sort of competent, managerial presence that frowns upon engaging with Trump on his own terms as unruly. Being reactive and \u201cfact-checking\u201d Trump can only get us so far. The fight must be both dirty and inspiring. It needs to get to a point where a Democratic presidential candidate can say: \u201cThe longer Trump and the Republicans talk about identity politics, I got \u2019em.\u201d \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<h2>1) Bruce makes dent in the battle to win over sceptics</h2> <p>It will not end the culture war between Newcastle fans and Mike Ashley, but victory at the Tottenham Stadium might just lift a few suspicions over Steve Bruce. In the first half, Newcastle were the team with greater vigour, and Joelinton\u2019s finish for his goal followed a fine pass from Christian Atsu. Bruce does not enjoy comparisons with Rafa Ben\u00edtez, but players such as Atsu, Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Sean Longstaff might just be allowed greater freedom to express themselves under his supervision than they were within the Spaniard\u2019s rigid tactics. Having taken the lead, plenty of last-ditch defending was required \u2013 not a long-term strategy for progress in the Premier League \u2013 but Newcastle did look organised. And beating the team Ashley grew up supporting was sweet for Bruce and his fellow Geordies. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/tottenham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Tottenham 0-1 Newcastle</a></em></p> <h2>2) Unflappable Mount shows his versatility</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/aug/25/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend\u2019s best Premier League photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It takes more than a late positional switch to faze Mason Mount. The Chelsea midfielder was supposed to play behind Tammy Abraham in the 3-2 win at Norwich on Saturday but Frank Lampard had to shift him to the left when Pedro Rodr\u00edguez injured a hamstring in the warm-up. Mount\u2019s response was to play a part in Abraham\u2019s first goal and he later scored for the second time in two games, boosting his chances of an England call in the near future. \u201cI think he can go to the top,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a boy who wants the razzmatazz of it all, he just wants to be a top player for Chelsea and England. The confidence he has helps. I said to him five minutes before we went out that you\u2019ll have to play on the left wing and come inside. It was no bother. He just took it on board and made all the right moves.\u201d <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/norwich-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Norwich 2-3 Chelsea</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Everton\u2019s heavyweights pack little punch</h2> <p>Frustration was written all over Marco Silva\u2019s face. There was frustration with the result at Aston Villa and frustration with the way their opponents defended. \u201cWe controlled all the second half, it\u2019s not easy to play against a team with nine players around their box,\u201d the Everton manager said a little unfairly. Deep down, Silva must have been frustrated with his players too. Andr\u00e9 Gomes was poor, Gylfi Sigurdsson a substitution waiting to happen and Richarlison peripheral \u2013 that is \u00a3100m worth of talent. The list could go on. It was not until the introduction of Alex Iwobi and Moise Kean that Everton started to attack with any conviction. Iwobi hit an upright and Kean set up a wonderful chance for Theo Walcott. While both those new signings will surely start against Wolves on Sunday, Everton need some of their other big names to come to the party. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/23/aston-villa-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Aston Villa 2-0 Everton</a></em></p> <h2>4) Wilson\u2019s wondergoal hints at a transfer masterstroke</h2> <p>Eddie Howe had to act quickly on the eve of the season when David Brooks was ruled out for around three months with an ankle injury but the loan signing of Harry Wilson from Liverpool already looks to have been a masterstroke. The Welshman\u2019s unstoppable free-kick against Manchester City after he came off the bench to replace the injured Charlie Daniels briefly raised hopes of ending Bournemouth\u2019s awful record against the champions before Sergio Ag\u00fcero settled matters on the south coast. Wilson has made a name for himself by scoring spectacular goals \u2013 no player in England\u2019s four professional divisions has managed more from outside the penalty area since the start of last season, when he was on loan at Derby \u2013 and Howe admitted he will be expecting a few more before he returns to Anfield. \u201cI think Harry will probably want the next one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve scored that many in the past.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester City</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a0896739f106ee50d4417d0be554527ac717a7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a0896739f106ee50d4417d0be554527ac717a7d/0_0_2802_1752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sergio Ag\u00fcero scores his second goal in City\u2019s win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sergio Ag\u00fcero scores his second goal in City\u2019s win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Saints limp to flattering win</h2> <p>Were it not for Florin Andone\u2019s rush of blood, Southampton might have been joining Watford in early\u2011season crisis-club nil-point status. Andone looked as dumbfounded as anyone after the high-stepping hack on Yan Valery that was the most obvious of red cards. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like a great tackle,\u201d Graham Potter said, embracing understatement. There were also Saintly sighs of relief when Lewis Dunk had a towering header chalked off by VAR. And J\u00fcrgen Locadia struck a post late on when Southampton were only a goal up, through Moussa Djenepo\u2019s excellent strike. Victory did not alter the grim\u2011faced expression Ralf Hasenh\u00fcttl has worn through his team\u2019s slow start, which has included defeats by Burnley and Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we must do it much better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was too hectic.\u201d <strong>JB</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/brighton-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 0-2 Southampton</a></em></p> <h2>6) Lacazette left out again for marquee match</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-arsenal\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s creative chaos brings new meaning to the \u2018Liverpool way\u2019 | Richard Jolly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alexandre Lacazette could be forgiven for dreading August. Since his arrival in 2017, Arsenal have played four league games against big-six opponents in the opening month. Lacazette has begun all on the bench. Two years ago, he was the odd man out when Danny Welbeck, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Mesut \u00d6zil were selected ahead of him at Anfield. Twelve months ago, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and \u00d6zil were preferred against Manchester City and Chelsea. Even his status as Arsenal\u2019s reigning player of the year did not save Lacazette oOn Saturday; Aubameyang was instead joined in attack by the full debutant Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. While the \u00a372m signing showed his pace and threat to offer encouragement and Lacazette should complete a front three who could torment lesser opponents, the Frenchman may wonder why he always seems to have a point to prove to his managers when it comes to selection for the marquee matches. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 3-1 Arsenal</a></em></p> <h2>7) Cahill\u2019s arrival galvanises Palace</h2> <p>Gary Cahill enjoyed the best of debuts as Crystal Palace beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in the league for the first time in 30 years. A 33-year-old who has 61 caps for England signed on a free from Chelsea may turn out to be the bargain of the summer. And though Cahill \u2013 understandably \u2013 struggled with the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, he was integral to a proud result. \u201cThere are going to be a lot more games in this league where you have more possession,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be one of them here. We dropped into a shape and worked very hard in it. We managed the game well in difficult moments and showed great desire. We showed that determination and it would have been easy to crumble at 1-1. To hit them on the break was great. We knew it was going to be difficult coming here.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/manchester-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester United 1-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> <h2>8) Choudhury adds midfield bite</h2> <p>Harvey Barnes scored a superb goal for Leicester at Bramall Lane and James Maddison shimmered with creativity throughout. But Brendan Rodgers wanted to ensure the contribution of another young talent was not overlooked. \u201cHamza Choudhury was absolutely brilliant,\u201d said Leicester\u2019s manager. \u201cI like his ability to press the game and play an aggressive game. He is one of the best in terms of getting up to the ball and winning it back.\u201d Performances such as this one suggest Choudhury has learned from the red card he received for a bad tackle on France\u2019s Jonathan Bamba during England\u2019s elimination from the European Under-21s Championship in June. \u201cHe was very unlucky [with that tackle],\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cHe was just a fraction out from being an incredible challenge. But he is a good boy, an honest boy and he has responded to that.\u201d <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/sheffield-united-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sheffield United 1-2 Leicester</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae1be06b55b7322d9c3f96754619c8bb94e700b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae1be06b55b7322d9c3f96754619c8bb94e700b7/0_14_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leicester City\u2019s Hamza Choudhury celebrates after the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leicester City\u2019s Hamza Choudhury celebrates after the final whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Hammers hope Haller will bring the goals</h2> <p>Have West Ham finally found themselves a top-level centre\u2011forward for the long term? You would hope so, given S\u00e9bastien Haller set them back \u00a345m, and the signs were promising in Saturday\u2019s helter-skelter match at Watford. Even if Haller looked rusty when failing to get a shot off in the buildup to Mark Noble\u2019s early penalty, he was a menacing presence around the box for the rest of the afternoon and was in the right place when it mattered to score the decisive goals. The 6ft 3in Haller shares certain similarities with Andy Carroll but is five years younger and, should he stay fit, could easily prove the spearhead West Ham hoped the England striker would be. On this evidence he will have plenty of chances to finish: Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side in effect played with four forwards and got away with it defensively, partly because Noble provided vital midfield stability on his return to the team, exactly 15 years after his debut. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/watford-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Watford 1-3 West Ham</a></em></p> <h2>10) McNeil triumphs in battle of the wunderkinds</h2> <p>Molineux witnessed a tired Wolves tear a point from the grip of Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley at the last on Sunday, but the crowd also got to watch two young English prospects strut their stuff. Morgan Gibbs-White was given a rare Premier League start for Wolves and, while he wasn\u2019t alone in his failings, the midfielder fluffed his lines. On the Burnley side, however, the winger Dwight McNeil continued to show how important he is to the Clarets. A constant outlet who refused to lose the ball and was able to advance possession upfield without a burst of pace or having to throw a trick, the teenager looked the most composed player on the field and assisted Ashley Barnes for his goal. McNeil is not an England youth star like the Under-17 World Cup winner Gibbs-White but his future definitely looks bright. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a

      "bodyText": "1) Bruce makes dent in the battle to win over sceptics It will not end the culture war between Newcastle fans and Mike Ashley, but victory at the Tottenham Stadium might just lift a few suspicions over Steve Bruce. In the first half, Newcastle were the team with greater vigour, and Joelinton\u2019s finish for his goal followed a fine pass from Christian Atsu. Bruce does not enjoy comparisons with Rafa Ben\u00edtez, but players such as Atsu, Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Sean Longstaff might just be allowed greater freedom to express themselves under his supervision than they were within the Spaniard\u2019s rigid tactics. Having taken the lead, plenty of last-ditch defending was required \u2013 not a long-term strategy for progress in the Premier League \u2013 but Newcastle did look organised. And beating the team Ashley grew up supporting was sweet for Bruce and his fellow Geordies. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 0-1 Newcastle 2) Unflappable Mount shows his versatility It takes more than a late positional switch to faze Mason Mount. The Chelsea midfielder was supposed to play behind Tammy Abraham in the 3-2 win at Norwich on Saturday but Frank Lampard had to shift him to the left when Pedro Rodr\u00edguez injured a hamstring in the warm-up. Mount\u2019s response was to play a part in Abraham\u2019s first goal and he later scored for the second time in two games, boosting his chances of an England call in the near future. \u201cI think he can go to the top,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a boy who wants the razzmatazz of it all, he just wants to be a top player for Chelsea and England. The confidence he has helps. I said to him five minutes before we went out that you\u2019ll have to play on the left wing and come inside. It was no bother. He just took it on board and made all the right moves.\u201d Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Norwich 2-3 Chelsea 3) Everton\u2019s heavyweights pack little punch Frustration was written all over Marco Silva\u2019s face. There was frustration with the result at Aston Villa and frustration with the way their opponents defended. \u201cWe controlled all the second half, it\u2019s not easy to play against a team with nine players around their box,\u201d the Everton manager said a little unfairly. Deep down, Silva must have been frustrated with his players too. Andr\u00e9 Gomes was poor, Gylfi Sigurdsson a substitution waiting to happen and Richarlison peripheral \u2013 that is \u00a3100m worth of talent. The list could go on. It was not until the introduction of Alex Iwobi and Moise Kean that Everton started to attack with any conviction. Iwobi hit an upright and Kean set up a wonderful chance for Theo Walcott. While both those new signings will surely start against Wolves on Sunday, Everton need some of their other big names to come to the party. Stuart James \u2022 Match report: Aston Villa 2-0 Everton 4) Wilson\u2019s wondergoal hints at a transfer masterstroke Eddie Howe had to act quickly on the eve of the season when David Brooks was ruled out for around three months with an ankle injury but the loan signing of Harry Wilson from Liverpool already looks to have been a masterstroke. The Welshman\u2019s unstoppable free-kick against Manchester City after he came off the bench to replace the injured Charlie Daniels briefly raised hopes of ending Bournemouth\u2019s awful record against the champions before Sergio Ag\u00fcero settled matters on the south coast. Wilson has made a name for himself by scoring spectacular goals \u2013 no player in England\u2019s four professional divisions has managed more from outside the penalty area since the start of last season, when he was on loan at Derby \u2013 and Howe admitted he will be expecting a few more before he returns to Anfield. \u201cI think Harry will probably want the next one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve scored that many in the past.\u201d Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester City 5) Saints limp to flattering win Were it not for Florin Andone\u2019s rush of blood, Southampton might have been joining Watford in early\u2011season crisis-club nil-point status. Andone looked as dumbfounded as anyone after the high-stepping hack on Yan Valery that was the most obvious of red cards. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like a great tackle,\u201d Graham Potter said, embracing understatement. There were also Saintly sighs of relief when Lewis Dunk had a towering header chalked off by VAR. And J\u00fcrgen Locadia struck a post late on when Southampton were only a goal up, through Moussa Djenepo\u2019s excellent strike. Victory did not alter the grim\u2011faced expression Ralf Hasenh\u00fcttl has worn through his team\u2019s slow start, which has included defeats by Burnley and Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we must do it much better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was too hectic.\u201d JB \u2022 Match report: Brighton 0-2 Southampton 6) Lacazette left out again for marquee match Alexandre Lacazette could be forgiven for dreading August. Since his arrival in 2017, Arsenal have played four league games against big-six opponents in the opening month. Lacazette has begun all on the bench. Two years ago, he was the odd man out when Danny Welbeck, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Mesut \u00d6zil were selected ahead of him at Anfield. Twelve months ago, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and \u00d6zil were preferred against Manchester City and Chelsea. Even his status as Arsenal\u2019s reigning player of the year did not save Lacazette oOn Saturday; Aubameyang was instead joined in attack by the full debutant Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. While the \u00a372m signing showed his pace and threat to offer encouragement and Lacazette should complete a front three who could torment lesser opponents, the Frenchman may wonder why he always seems to have a point to prove to his managers when it comes to selection for the marquee matches. Richard Jolly \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 3-1 Arsenal 7) Cahill\u2019s arrival galvanises Palace Gary Cahill enjoyed the best of debuts as Crystal Palace beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in the league for the first time in 30 years. A 33-year-old who has 61 caps for England signed on a free from Chelsea may turn out to be the bargain of the summer. And though Cahill \u2013 understandably \u2013 struggled with the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, he was integral to a proud result. \u201cThere are going to be a lot more games in this league where you have more possession,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be one of them here. We dropped into a shape and worked very hard in it. We managed the game well in difficult moments and showed great desire. We showed that determination and it would have been easy to crumble at 1-1. To hit them on the break was great. We knew it was going to be difficult coming here.\u201d Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 1-2 Crystal Palace 8) Choudhury adds midfield bite Harvey Barnes scored a superb goal for Leicester at Bramall Lane and James Maddison shimmered with creativity throughout. But Brendan Rodgers wanted to ensure the contribution of another young talent was not overlooked. \u201cHamza Choudhury was absolutely brilliant,\u201d said Leicester\u2019s manager. \u201cI like his ability to press the game and play an aggressive game. He is one of the best in terms of getting up to the ball and winning it back.\u201d Performances such as this one suggest Choudhury has learned from the red card he received for a bad tackle on France\u2019s Jonathan Bamba during England\u2019s elimination from the European Under-21s Championship in June. \u201cHe was very unlucky [with that tackle],\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cHe was just a fraction out from being an incredible challenge. But he is a good boy, an honest boy and he has responded to that.\u201d Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 1-2 Leicester 9) Hammers hope Haller will bring the goals Have West Ham finally found themselves a top-level centre\u2011forward for the long term? You would hope so, given S\u00e9bastien Haller set them back \u00a345m, and the signs were promising in Saturday\u2019s helter-skelter match at Watford. Even if Haller looked rusty when failing to get a shot off in the buildup to Mark Noble\u2019s early penalty, he was a menacing presence around the box for the rest of the afternoon and was in the right place when it mattered to score the decisive goals. The 6ft 3in Haller shares certain similarities with Andy Carroll but is five years younger and, should he stay fit, could easily prove the spearhead West Ham hoped the England striker would be. On this evidence he will have plenty of chances to finish: Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side in effect played with four forwards and got away with it defensively, partly because Noble provided vital midfield stability on his return to the team, exactly 15 years after his debut. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Watford 1-3 West Ham 10) McNeil triumphs in battle of the wunderkinds Molineux witnessed a tired Wolves tear a point from the grip of Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley at the last on Sunday, but the crowd also got to watch two young English prospects strut their stuff. Morgan Gibbs-White was given a rare Premier League start for Wolves and, while he wasn\u2019t alone in his failings, the midfielder fluffed his lines. On the Burnley side, however, the winger Dwight McNeil continued to show how important he is to the Clarets. A constant outlet who refused to lose the ball and was able to advance possession upfield without a burst of pace or having to throw a trick, the teenager looked the most composed player on the field and assisted Ashley Barnes for his goal. McNeil is not an England youth star like the Under-17 World Cup winner Gibbs-White but his future definitely looks bright. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Wolves 1-1 Burnley",

      "bodyText": "Please forgive me for not knowing \u2013 I am old(ish) \u2013 but what\u2019s all this on the web about the chicken video? Hi Dave. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s got nothing to do with age, and everything with knowing what you should and should not do when it comes to cooking chicken, tortillas and pizza. Basically, a horrible video recipe has emerged from a cooking site called Twisted Food. It starts with chicken and spices, then adds horror and complexity, and keeps going and going and going until what you end up with is a Deep-fried BBQ Chicken-stuffed Pizzadilla. Other ingredients include pepperoni and cheese, breadcrumbs and ranch sauce to dip it in. So this video is sort of like a cooking programme but with chicken? Yes. A big reason why this has taken off is it seems to sum up everything wrong with the latest trend in social media-friendly recipe extravaganzas. The video draws on a format pioneered by Buzzfeed Tasty \u2013 and now incessantly copied by others. It\u2019s short, accessible, wordless and frequently overlaps with the \u201clifehack\u201d phenomenon. And since we all know how well Frankensteined stoner foods do on social media \u2013 see the Cronut (croissant-meets-donut); the freakshakes; the pizza that has literal cheeseburgers in its crust \u2013 a lot of Tasty recipes have also begun to push the envelope, combining various kinds of foods into new forms. There are shades here of even older video-cooking pioneers too, like Youtube\u2019s Epic Meal Time. They have, since 2010, made things like a \u201cMeatzza\u201d (a pizza with a crust made of sausage) and the \u201cTurBaconEpicCentipede\u201d \u2013 which was 10 roast piglets stuffed with turkey, duck and chicken, stitched together. It\u2019s all about going that extra step. Crucially, this latest one isn\u2019t actually from Tasty \u2013 but, given they have in the past made similar travesties like a double cheeseburger bread bowl, or a grilled cheese sloppy joe cup, you can permit the confusion. Surely this has to have come from Donald Trump\u2019s America? Another surprise! No. It\u2019s in fact from your home, England. But now that is Boris Johnson\u2019s England \u2013 so that may explain it. I\u2019m technically more Scottish than English. Sorry. Back to the Deep-fried BBQ Chicken-stuffed Pizzadilla. If I was walking briskly across open countryside \u2013 how long would it take for me to walk that off? According to my hasty calculations it contains 7,275 calories. That is using a freely-available meal calculator, and not including the calories that come from deep frying. You should also add a thousand or so calories for the oil the breadcrumbs absorb. It is well within the remit of the law. Using an estimated 350 calories burned an hour while walking, that will take maybe around 24 hours. Has anyone been known to actually eat this stuff? One brave person has taken the plunge, in a startling and gripping Twitter thread. Beyond that, we do not yet have any confirmed ingestors. Which could have something to do with the recipe itself. Shay Spence, the food editor of People magazine, took more than six hours to craft the beast. As you can see, he also discovered that many of the steps are perhaps physically impossible. At the time of publication, Spence had only just completed it mere minutes ago. He immediately started retching. Later tweets described it as \u201ctruly one of the most vile things I\u2019ve ever eaten\u201d. Guardian Australia has contacted Spence for comment.",

      "bodyText": "A major split is emerging between the Nationals and the Liberals over water policy as the New South Wales government grapples with an overhaul of the Barwon-Darling water rules that will restrict extractions by the cotton industry. The NSW minister for water, Melinda Pavey, has launched an extraordinary attack on the independent Natural Resources Commission, disputing its scientific findings that over-extraction in the Barwon-Darling has pushed the Darling into hydrological drought three years early. This finding is being used to underpin its central recommendation: that the threshold for extracting water from the river system needs to be raised. In a draft letter sent to the head of the Natural Resources Commission, Dr John Keniry, Pavey has accused its scientific expert, Professor Fran Sheldon, of having a conflict of interest because the peer review was undertaken by scientists with whom Sheldon had collaborated in the past. Pavey, who asked WaterNSW to produce a second analysis, says Sheldon did not have access to the Barwon-Darling operations model \u2013 which contains the detail of water extractions.

The irrigators are believed to be pushing for a buyout of water rights under the existing rules at an estimated cost of $40m. The 2012 Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan \u2013 and rules that allow irrigators to pump during low-flow events and take 300% of their entitlements in one year \u2013 have long been controversial. Guardian Australia revealed almost two years ago that the then water minister, Katrina Hodgkinson, made late changes to the plan under lobbying from the cotton industry, to allow them to take water when the river was low. Former head of the Australian Federal Police Mick Keelty, who was tasked by the federal government to investigate what was happening in the Northern Basin, has also sounded the alarm. Keelty told The Saturday Paper in April that he was concerned about the extent of undeclared conflicts of interest among politicians, lobby groups and businesses operating in the water market. \u201cI\u2019m interested to see how conflicted politicians are declaring their conflicts of interest when decisions are made about water policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere you get those conflicts of interest and they\u2019re not addressed, that\u2019s ripe for corruption.\u201d He briefed water ministers two weeks ago about his report into management of the Northern Basin. The NRC review was ordered by the former NSW water minister, Niall Blair, in the wake of the fish kills in Menindee and concerns that the Barwon-Darling water sharing rules needed to be addressed urgently. But before it reported, he stepped down as a frontbencher, citing personal issues and the stresses of the job. Pavey took over and appointed a former CEO of the National Irrigators Council, Tom Chesson, as her senior water advisor. Chesson was also previously a political adviser to other Nationals. Independent MP Justin Field said the Nationals could not be trusted with water. \u201cThey are trying to shoot the messenger to distract from previous decisions which have been a gift to vested irrigator interests and a disaster for our rivers and downstream communities,\u201d Field said. \u201cThe independent NRC\u2019s report makes clear the water-sharing arrangements are delivering for a handful of irrigators and leaving the river starved at times of low flows.\u201d The decision to raise the threshold for the cease-to-pump rules would have major implications for Class A licence holders.

      "bodyText": "Qantas is under renewed pressure over the forced deportation of asylum seekers, with an American investment firm joining a proposed shareholder resolution calling on the airline to review its policy and processes. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility has teamed up with US\u2013based asset manager Mercy Investment Services to co\u2013file a motion urging the airline to examine its involvement in deportations. The organisation wants Qantas to justify how deportations square with its commitment to the United Nations guiding principles of business and human rights. Qantas shareholders will consider the motion at the airline\u2019s upcoming annual general meeting in late October. At present, the airline transports people at the request of the home affairs department but critics say many refused refugees have not been properly assessed, in what could be a violation of international law. Qantas has consistently stated it would not refuse deportations. \u201cIt is not the role of airlines to adjudicate on complex immigration decisions, particularly as information used in determination processes is not publicly available. To do so would undermine the government, the judicial system and their processes,\u201d Qantas says. Supporters of a Tamil asylum seeker family, facing imminent deportation after 17 months in detention since being arrested at their home in Biloela, Queensland, have called on the Australian airline industry to show some \u201cmoral leadership\u201d. \u201cWe are calling on the whole aviation industry \u2013 from those responsible for the management of the airlines, down to the pilots, ground crew and cabin crew, to show moral leadership and refuse to fly Nades, Priya, Kopika and Tharunicaa from Australia to an uncertain fate in Sri Lanka,\u201d a Home to Biloela campaign spokeswoman said. The family lost a bid to take their case to the high court in May. The parents, Nades and Priya, arrived separately in Australia in 2012 and 2013 respectively, by boat, and sought asylum. The couple married and had two daughters, now aged four and two. \u201cThis family do not consent to their removal; they have grave fears about their future if they are forced back to Sri Lanka. An act of courageous leadership would be for airlines to commit to only flying this family home to safety in Biloela,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Protesters rallied in Melbourne over the weekend in support of the family remaining in Australia. The Human Rights Law Centre spokeswoman Keren Adams said Qantas isn\u2019t legally obliged to carry out forced deportations and transfers on behalf of the Australian government. \u201cAirlines have the power to ask Home Affairs for more information about a person being deported before they agree to fly them anywhere,\u201d Adams said. The National Justice Project managing director, George Newhouse, said people are being pressured to return to countries where they are at serious risk of harm and human rights violations. \u201cI know of several people who were killed after they returned. While the government may categorise these as voluntary removals, the coercion involved raises serious questions under international law,\u201d Newhouse said. Refugee Advice and Casework Service noted an increase in deportation activity. \u201cIt is more important than ever that corporations such as Qantas take the lead on human rights and put an end to complicity,\u201d the RACS director Sarah Dale said. Internationally, other airlines have refused to deport refugees or immigrants on government orders. In the UK, Virgin Atlantic has refused to deport immigrants after a spate of wrongful removals known as the Windrush scandal. Last year six US airlines including United, Delta and American Airlines announced their refusal to participate in transporting children separated from their families at US borders as a result of Trump administration policies. In Germany, pilots for Lufthansa have also refused to deport unwilling asylum seekers due to a range of reasons, with government figures claiming 222 deportations failed last year due to pilots refusing to take off. In Australia, Virgin Australia also facilitates forced deportations. Last year, nine finalists for an annual women of influence award that is sponsored by Qantas, including the former Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs, wrote a joint letter of protest to the airline asking it to stop deporting asylum seekers. Qantas declined to comment on the shareholder resolution but noted ACCR\u2019s resolution at last year\u2019s annual general meeting only attracted support from 6.43% of shareholders.",

Yee also held a senior role with the Chinese Friends of Labor group. Explosive evidence has already been given to Icac by Kaila Murnain, the current NSW Labor general secretary, who was an assistant secretary of Chinese Friends of Labor in 2015. She has told Icac that the former Labor state MP Ernest Wong had told her Huang was the true source of the $100,000. \u201cOf course, Ms Murnain\u2019s statement as to what Mr Wong is said to have told her is not, of itself, conclusive proof that there were one or more \u2018straw donors\u2019 or \u2018pretend donors\u2019 associated with the Chinese Friends of Labor function in 2015 or that there was a scheme to conceal the fact that Mr Huang was the true source of funds,\u201d Icac counsel assisting, Scott Robertson, told the inquiry. \u201cI anticipate though, that other evidence bearing on that issue will be presented during the course of this public inquiry.\u201d The alleged crimes Icac are investigating are punishable by up to two years\u2019 imprisonment in most cases, and, in one case, up to 10 years. Icac began a full investigation, codenamed Operation Aero, in June, after a preliminary inquiry determined there was \u201cevidence or reliable information to suggest the occurrence of the conduct referred\u201d. Late last year, about 10 officers descended on the NSW Labor headquarters with a search warrant, attracting widespread media attention. The timing of the raid, three months before the state election, angered the party, which complained that the matter had already been investigated comprehensively by the NSW electoral commission. Hall, the chief commissioner, is presiding over the hearing, which has been set down for six weeks. Murnain and Wong are expected to give evidence. The former Labor senator Sam Dastyari is also scheduled to give evidence. Dastyari sensationally quit parliament in 2017 after revelations of his links to Chinese donors, including Huang.

Labor has called the meeting of migration and border security experts as it seeks to turn up the heat on the Coalition over its management of the visa system, pointing to the 80,000 people who have arrived by plane to claim asylum since 2014. Only about 10% are found to be refugees, but the surge in claims means a backlog in processing that has left more than 200,000 people in the community on bridging visas who are vulnerable to exploitation. The roundtable, convened by Labor\u2019s home affairs shadow minister, Kristina Keneally, heard from John Coyne, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s head of border security, who warned the visa system was being exploited. \u201cOrganised crime are indeed facilitating unlawful migration on a fee-for-service basis, using methodologies from fake identity documents, to gaming Australia\u2019s visa system,\u201d Coyne said \u201cAustralia\u2019s border security arrangements are being exploited, and individuals who have not been appropriately identified are at times entering the country. \u201cThe Australian black economy is indeed being supported by organised crime, who along with businesses involved, are using these methods to exploit workers, and those involved are not paying taxes and are often remitting their salaries out of the country.\u201d Emma Germano, the horticulture president of the Victorian farmers federation, said that the Australian agriculture sector was at the \u201ccoalface\u201d of the problem given the industry\u2019s reliance on labour hire firms.

If you\u2019re in the habit of reading political memoirs, the extent to which Labour relied on Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson for advice might be revelatory. It\u2019s always salutary to be reminded of grotesques like Keith Allen (\u201cI used to climb out of the Colony back window, come across the roof to the Groucho, tap on the ladies window, go in, have a line and a fuck and go off into the club\u201d) \u2013 just one period figure over-enabled by lad culture</p> <p>The names are big. Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell join half-a-dozen Labour party voices, many still spinning about spin, but former Tory PM John Major and former health secretary Virginia Bottomley are here too, providing context and counterweight: Britpop actually happened on Major\u2019s watch. Unexpectedly, Bottomley comes out to bat for <em>Trainspotting</em>, finding it \u201cchallenging and raw\u201d but communicating \u201ca culture\u2026 an exempted group who needed to be understood and recognised\u201d.</p> <p>Noel Gallagher, Damon Albarn, Brett Anderson and Jarvis Cocker head a noisy chorus that also includes a particularly trenchant Tjinder Singh of Cornershop, a candid Spice Girl Mel C (\u201cwe hijacked the phrase [Girl Power] from [the band] Shampoo\u201d), and the respective PRs who tried to manage the images of Oasis (Johnny Hopkins) and Blur (Karen Johnson).</p> <p>The whiteness of the Britpop era can be blinding: Rachel doesn\u2019t forget that <em>Goodness Gracious Me</em>, <em>Bhaji on the Beach</em> and <em>Bend It Like Beckham</em> were part of the era\u2019s spectacular cultural remix. He does, however, devote needless pages to ball-by-ball coverage of Euro \u201996, and gives <em>Loaded</em> and laddism an easy ride, allowing the confraternity of \u201cmen who should know better\u201d considerable airtime with only mild challenges. The reality is darker: their jokey normalisation of sexism led inexorably to our routine contemporary misogyny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jarvis Cocker leads the charge of those aghast at the orgiastic patriotism that ensued</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You could always gripe about the absentees: Elastica\u2019s Justine Frischmann, who hugely influenced the sensibilities of both Suede and Blur, is missing, as is Piers Morgan, the showbiz hack who became editor of the <em>Mirror</em> when the tabloids rebranded as purveyors of celebrity gossip first and news second. Damien Hirst would have been useful, but Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas are expert witnesses, as is former Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister, Machiavellian PR Matthew Freud and a guy from the Football Association, all with their war stories, their post-hoc justifications and occasional bouts of rueful mea culpa.</p> <p>Oral histories are eminently readable, allowing for dissent and contrast. Rachel\u2019s editorialising is confined to an explanatory introduction and his fairly blokeish agenda-setting. He\u2019s a mod, and mates with Ocean Colour Scene, so understands a key feature of the era: the conscious act of detoxifying the union jack, reclaiming it as the flag flown by the Jam and the Who rather than the banner of racists, something the Labour government was equally keen to do.</p> <p>But various media both here and abroad seized on it as visual shorthand and soon, all subtlety was lost. Cocker leads the charge of those aghast at the orgiastic patriotism that ensued; Irvine Welsh is similarly scabrous. Perhaps the book\u2019s greatest irritation is its repeated attempts to define Cool Britannia, which leaves everyone floundering or hand-wringing. There was a confluence and a cross-pollination of many creatives in a booming economy under a helpful government. This book is a timely reminder, though, of exactly how much messaging, perception and image counted \u2013 not so different from the Instagram era after all, perhaps.</p> <p><em>This review is from the Observer </em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger: The Rise and Fall of Cool Britannia</em> by Daniel Rachel is published by Orion (\u00a320).

Even if you are familiar with, say, the Britpop saga, the machinations that produced the Young British Artists, the Turner prize and the Tate Modern are illuminating. If you\u2019re in the habit of reading political memoirs, the extent to which Labour relied on Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson for advice might be revelatory. It\u2019s always salutary to be reminded of grotesques like Keith Allen (\u201cI used to climb out of the Colony back window, come across the roof to the Groucho, tap on the ladies window, go in, have a line and a fuck and go off into the club\u201d) \u2013 just one period figure over-enabled by lad culture The names are big. Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell join half-a-dozen Labour party voices, many still spinning about spin, but former Tory PM John Major and former health secretary Virginia Bottomley are here too, providing context and counterweight: Britpop actually happened on Major\u2019s watch. Unexpectedly, Bottomley comes out to bat for Trainspotting, finding it \u201cchallenging and raw\u201d but communicating \u201ca culture\u2026 an exempted group who needed to be understood and recognised\u201d. Noel Gallagher, Damon Albarn, Brett Anderson and Jarvis Cocker head a noisy chorus that also includes a particularly trenchant Tjinder Singh of Cornershop, a candid Spice Girl Mel C (\u201cwe hijacked the phrase [Girl Power] from [the band] Shampoo\u201d), and the respective PRs who tried to manage the images of Oasis (Johnny Hopkins) and Blur (Karen Johnson). The whiteness of the Britpop era can be blinding: Rachel doesn\u2019t forget that Goodness Gracious Me, Bhaji on the Beach and Bend It Like Beckham were part of the era\u2019s spectacular cultural remix. He does, however, devote needless pages to ball-by-ball coverage of Euro \u201996, and gives Loaded and laddism an easy ride, allowing the confraternity of \u201cmen who should know better\u201d considerable airtime with only mild challenges. The reality is darker: their jokey normalisation of sexism led inexorably to our routine contemporary misogyny. You could always gripe about the absentees: Elastica\u2019s Justine Frischmann, who hugely influenced the sensibilities of both Suede and Blur, is missing, as is Piers Morgan, the showbiz hack who became editor of the Mirror when the tabloids rebranded as purveyors of celebrity gossip first and news second. Damien Hirst would have been useful, but Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas are expert witnesses, as is former Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister, Machiavellian PR Matthew Freud and a guy from the Football Association, all with their war stories, their post-hoc justifications and occasional bouts of rueful mea culpa. Oral histories are eminently readable, allowing for dissent and contrast. Rachel\u2019s editorialising is confined to an explanatory introduction and his fairly blokeish agenda-setting. He\u2019s a mod, and mates with Ocean Colour Scene, so understands a key feature of the era: the conscious act of detoxifying the union jack, reclaiming it as the flag flown by the Jam and the Who rather than the banner of racists, something the Labour government was equally keen to do. But various media both here and abroad seized on it as visual shorthand and soon, all subtlety was lost. Cocker leads the charge of those aghast at the orgiastic patriotism that ensued; Irvine Welsh is similarly scabrous. Perhaps the book\u2019s greatest irritation is its repeated attempts to define Cool Britannia, which leaves everyone floundering or hand-wringing. There was a confluence and a cross-pollination of many creatives in a booming economy under a helpful government. This book is a timely reminder, though, of exactly how much messaging, perception and image counted \u2013 not so different from the Instagram era after all, perhaps.

      "body": "<p>I knew it was coming; I had known it was coming for years. I had seen my friends go through it, and I had spent many hours thinking deeply about what would happen. Comforted by theories on the nature of consciousness, seduced by feasible rationales for an afterlife, sobered by the practical science of what was really going to happen, I was prepared. And then she died.</p> <p>My nana had been ill for a long time. Her final diagnosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, came 12 years before she died, although the prognosis was no more than four. She had come close so many times that we had started calling her \u201cthe boomerang\u201d. But when she went into hospital for the last time, although in our heads we constructed logical expectations of her coming back to us, in our hearts we knew she wasn\u2019t coming home.</p> <p>Losing someone close to you is something you can only really talk about once it has happened. All the cliches about grief that I had heard over the years became my reality. Half an hour after she died, my cousin Elliot and I sat in the hospital coffee shop, exhausted, paralysed, silently delirious, while a tiny white butterfly fluttered around our heads, flew a full circle above us and disappeared. Over the next week, the appearance of white butterflies comforted each member of my family at different times in some ineffable way. Despite our wildly varying degrees of faith, that delicate symbol soothed us with an understanding that she was OK: whether she was on a cloud with her brothers and parents, united on an unknown spiritual plane with a greater force as part of a universal consciousness, or just gone, she was no longer in pain.</p> <p>It was very sad, of course, and that is the best it was ever going to be. The reason I say \u201cthe best\u201d is that, if it were not for the acutely careful preparations of us all, including Nana, it could have been far worse.</p> <p>Palliative care should not be as taboo or scary as it is to many of us. I would go as far as to say that it is the ultimate in wellbeing practices, when a person\u2019s health has failed and all that can be done is care. The word \u201cpalliative\u201d comes from the Latin <em>pallium</em>, a cloak, and in many ways this metaphor is apt. In the last days, a \u201csyringe driver\u201d delivered her a steady flow of morphine and anti-anxiety drugs that concealed the worst of her symptoms, shielded her from their effects, protected her from the pain, and even hid her from death for a few more hours or days. If she had not had that, she would have died of hypoxia on the Thursday, gasping violently for breath as she drowned in carbon dioxide that her lungs were too weak to exhale. Instead, she went on until the following Tuesday, my auntie\u2019s birthday, not before she had me write in her card: \u201cLife is worth living because you\u2019re my daughter.\u201d When she finally passed, it was a moment of peace.</p> <p>(Note to doctors: if it could be called anything other than a \u201csyringe driver\u201d, I think everyone would be much happier. My bampy (grandfather) in particular was unnerved by the name and was initially convinced that it was going to speed up her death.)</p> <p>On the Saturday, when we all first expected her to go, we played her favourite songs at her bedside: lots of Maria Callas and Ella Fitzgerald, and (who knew?!) Hot Chocolate\u2019s No Doubt About It, a song that recounts Errol Brown\u2019s alien visitation. We were gifted the time to rejoice with her in what made her joyful, emotional and eccentric. As she appeared to slip away, our tear-stained faces fixed around her in uncontainable smiles, sure that the hour had come, she boomeranged back again, just in time for The Chase.</p> <p>Memories of moments in her final days are precious and I am gratefully aware of how lucky my family and I are to have had them. They exist because of palliative-care specialists. What a mystically unique role: part scientist, part shaman; half doctor, half priest; with careful words held equally as important as the careful drugs. Never hard-heartedly functional, and never \u201ccompulsively positive\u201d, it is as if they are of the same station as midwives, just on the other end. I am profoundly moved by this practice. The UK is reportedly the best in the world at end-of-life care, which is cause to be proud, and there are calls from both the International Association of Research in Cancer and the World Health Organization to declare palliative care a human right.</p> <p>As someone whose first close bereavement was sort-of-sweet-sad but without regret, I support these proposals wholeheartedly. I wish that all people could be treated with such deep compassion and humanity. I sincerely hope that, when it is my time to die, my family and I will be helped to prepare in the same caring, tender way that my grandmother and family were in Llandough on a long weekend in July.</p>",

Losing someone close to you is something you can only really talk about once it has happened. All the cliches about grief that I had heard over the years became my reality. Half an hour after she died, my cousin Elliot and I sat in the hospital coffee shop, exhausted, paralysed, silently delirious, while a tiny white butterfly fluttered around our heads, flew a full circle above us and disappeared. Over the next week, the appearance of white butterflies comforted each member of my family at different times in some ineffable way. Despite our wildly varying degrees of faith, that delicate symbol soothed us with an understanding that she was OK: whether she was on a cloud with her brothers and parents, united on an unknown spiritual plane with a greater force as part of a universal consciousness, or just gone, she was no longer in pain. It was very sad, of course, and that is the best it was ever going to be. The reason I say \u201cthe best\u201d is that, if it were not for the acutely careful preparations of us all, including Nana, it could have been far worse. Palliative care should not be as taboo or scary as it is to many of us. I would go as far as to say that it is the ultimate in wellbeing practices, when a person\u2019s health has failed and all that can be done is care. The word \u201cpalliative\u201d comes from the Latin pallium, a cloak, and in many ways this metaphor is apt. In the last days, a \u201csyringe driver\u201d delivered her a steady flow of morphine and anti-anxiety drugs that concealed the worst of her symptoms, shielded her from their effects, protected her from the pain, and even hid her from death for a few more hours or days. If she had not had that, she would have died of hypoxia on the Thursday, gasping violently for breath as she drowned in carbon dioxide that her lungs were too weak to exhale. Instead, she went on until the following Tuesday, my auntie\u2019s birthday, not before she had me write in her card: \u201cLife is worth living because you\u2019re my daughter.\u201d When she finally passed, it was a moment of peace. (Note to doctors: if it could be called anything other than a \u201csyringe driver\u201d, I think everyone would be much happier. My bampy (grandfather) in particular was unnerved by the name and was initially convinced that it was going to speed up her death.) On the Saturday, when we all first expected her to go, we played her favourite songs at her bedside: lots of Maria Callas and Ella Fitzgerald, and (who knew?!) Hot Chocolate\u2019s No Doubt About It, a song that recounts Errol Brown\u2019s alien visitation. We were gifted the time to rejoice with her in what made her joyful, emotional and eccentric. As she appeared to slip away, our tear-stained faces fixed around her in uncontainable smiles, sure that the hour had come, she boomeranged back again, just in time for The Chase. Memories of moments in her final days are precious and I am gratefully aware of how lucky my family and I are to have had them. They exist because of palliative-care specialists. What a mystically unique role: part scientist, part shaman; half doctor, half priest; with careful words held equally as important as the careful drugs. Never hard-heartedly functional, and never \u201ccompulsively positive\u201d, it is as if they are of the same station as midwives, just on the other end. I am profoundly moved by this practice. The UK is reportedly the best in the world at end-of-life care, which is cause to be proud, and there are calls from both the International Association of Research in Cancer and the World Health Organization to declare palliative care a human right. As someone whose first close bereavement was sort-of-sweet-sad but without regret, I support these proposals wholeheartedly. I wish that all people could be treated with such deep compassion and humanity. I sincerely hope that, when it is my time to die, my family and I will be helped to prepare in the same caring, tender way that my grandmother and family were in Llandough on a long weekend in July.",

      "body": "<h2>What is the menopause?</h2> <p>The menopause is when a woman\u2019s fertile period comes to a halt. This is generally a gradual process over months or even years, but technically the menopause is defined as when a woman has gone 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for this happening is 52 years, but about one in 100 women have a menopause before the age of 40.</p> <h2>How does the body know when to start ramping things down?</h2> <p>The menopause is programmed into female biology. It begins when the ovaries have too few eggs to keep powering the ovulation cycle. From childhood, the ovaries have thousands of eggs (200,000, say, but the number varies widely). These cells are constantly moving along a fertility conveyor belt, taking months to grow from primitive follicle to the mature egg which is released during ovulation. The process operates in a knock-out pyramid, with most eggs dying off along the way and only about 400 ever graduating to ovulation.</p> <p>The primordial follicles activate in clusters that grow and compete, with one egg (normally just one) winning out each month. But as women approach the menopause, the remaining follicles become more sparsely spaced. Beyond some critical threshold, they are no longer packed densely enough to exchange the chemical signals with their neighbours that allow them to activate in clusters. So even though eggs remain, they are dormant.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re losing their friends,\u201d says Prof Evelyn Telfer, of the University of Edinburgh. \u201cWhen the woman gets older and when there\u2019s a very low number they just don\u2019t activate.\u201d</p> <p>The follicles release oestrogen as they grow. So when they stop maturing, there is a steep drop in the levels of the hormone being produced, and that\u2019s what leads to menopausal symptoms.</p> <h2>How long does the typical menopause last?</h2> <p>Symptoms usually start a few months or years before a woman\u2019s periods stop \u2013 a phase known as the perimenopause \u2013 and on average last about four years from the last period. However, around one in 10 women experience symptoms for up to 12 years.</p> <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2> <p>The first indication of the menopause is a change in the normal pattern of a woman\u2019s periods \u2013 they may become either unusually light or heavy and could arrive with shorter breaks or be absent for months at a time.</p> <p>Hot flushes are the most striking symptom, although they don\u2019t affect everyone. About 20% of women report having none at all, about 80% have some and about 25% have hot flushes that are problematic. They normally involve a rush of heat over the upper body and face, sweating and possibly a reddened blotchy appearance. Night sweats can disturb sleep. Trying to disguise or distract from hot flushes in the workplace as a result of actual or perceived stigma around the menopause can be stressful and affect confidence.</p> <p>Other symptoms include vaginal dryness, changes in libido, mood swings, memory problems and higher risk of osteoporosis.</p> <h2>Can a woman still have a baby after menopause?</h2> <p>It is possible, through IVF treatment using either eggs frozen pre-menopause or donor eggs. Biomedical progress might open up other options. Post-menopause, women still have hundreds of follicles left in the ovaries and <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2160676-primitive-human-eggs-matured-in-the-lab-for-the-first-time/\" title=\"\">scientists have demonstrated</a> that it is possible to grow these follicles into mature eggs in the lab.</p> <p>A Japanese team is using a version of this technique in a clinical trial of an experimental fertility treatment called IV-activation, in which ovarian tissue is extracted, treated in the lab to encourage the follicles to mature and then grafted back into the ovary. They speculate that in the future, post-menopausal women might be able to have babies using such treatment.</p> <h2>Can a woman predict when she\u2019s going to hit the menopause?</h2> <p>The age at which a woman enters menopause is partly inherited. So asking your mother or grandmother is a good place to start. Some clinics offer ultrasound tests aimed at assessing the ovarian reserve. The scans can only see the most mature egg cells \u2013 the follicles are too small to spot \u2013 and the tests are not very accurate at predicting when the menopause will begin.</p> <p>Scientists are identifying ever more genes that contribute to the age menopause begins, but since it is a trait that is influenced by a large number of genes, it is not yet possible to get an accurate readout from a genetic test.</p> <h2>In terms of evolution, what\u2019s the point of the menopause?</h2> <p>One of the most compelling evolutionary explanations for menopause is the \u201creproductive conflict hypothesis\u201d. The idea is that when multiple generations live together in a patrilocal set up (that\u2019s to say, a woman moving in with her husband\u2019s parents), a woman would compete with her mother-in-law for the resources needed for babies and children if their reproductive schedules overlapped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Do%20men%20go%20through%20a%20%E2%80%9Cmanopause%E2%80%9D%3F&amp;description=Not%20really.%20The%20symptoms%20of%20the%20female%20menopause%20are%20linked%20to%20rapid%20hormonal%20changes.%20In%20men%2C%20testosterone%20peaks%20at%20around%20the%20age%20of%20twenty20%20and%20is%20on%20a%20gentle%20downward%20slope%20thereafter.%20A%20typical%20adult%20male%20testosterone%20concentration%20range%20is%2010%20%E2%80%93%20-30%20nanomoles%20per%20litre.%20Some%20men%20suffer%20from%20testosterone%20deficiency%20as%20they%20get%20older%20and%20might%20notice%20physical%20effects%20including%20reduced%20muscle%20mass%2C%20the%20appearance%20of%20%E2%80%9Cman%20boobs%E2%80%9D%2C%20decreased%20sex%20drive%2C%20problems%20sleeping%20and%20hot%20flushes.%20%E2%80%9COnce%20you%20go%20to%208eight%20or%206six%20(%5Bnanomoles%5D)%20that%E2%80%99s%20when%20people%20think%20about%20treatment%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Waljit%20Dhillo%2C%20professor%20in%20endocrinology%20and%20metabolism%20at%20Imperial%2C%20said.%0A%0AWhile%20we%E2%80%99re%20on%20the%20male%20menopause%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20worth%20mentioning%20that%20researchers%20have%20also%20found%20little%20supporting%20evidence%20for%20the%20existence%20of%20the%20midlife%20crisis.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Fact Box\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Do%20men%20go%20through%20a%20%E2%80%9Cmanopause%E2%80%9D%3F&description=Not%20really.%20The%20symptoms%20of%20the%20female%20menopause%20are%20linked%20to%20rapid%20hormonal%20changes.%20In%20men%2C%20testosterone%20peaks%20at%20around%20the%20age%20of%20twenty20%20and%20is%20on%20a%20gentle%20downward%20slope%20thereafter.%20A%20typical%20adult%20male%20testosterone%20concentration%20range%20is%2010%20%E2%80%93%20-30%20nanomoles%20per%20litre.%20Some%20men%20suffer%20from%20testosterone%20deficiency%20as%20they%20get%20older%20and%20might%20notice%20physical%20effects%20including%20reduced%20muscle%20mass%2C%20the%20appearance%20of%20%E2%80%9Cman%20boobs%E2%80%9D%2C%20decreased%20sex%20drive%2C%20problems%20sleeping%20and%20hot%20flushes.%20%E2%80%9COnce%20you%20go%20to%208eight%20or%206six%20(%5Bnanomoles%5D)%20that%E2%80%99s%20when%20people%20think%20about%20treatment%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Waljit%20Dhillo%2C%20professor%20in%20endocrinology%20and%20metabolism%20at%20Imperial%2C%20said.%0A%0AWhile%20we%E2%80%99re%20on%20the%20male%20menopause%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20worth%20mentioning%20that%20researchers%20have%20also%20found%20little%20supporting%20evidence%20for%20the%20existence%20of%20the%20midlife%20crisis.&link=false\">Fact Box</a> </figure>  <p>Research by Prof Virpi Lummaa, of the University of Turku in Finland, using a 200-year dataset on pre-industrial Finns, showed that simultaneous reproduction by daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law was linked to a far worse chance of children surviving.</p> <p>The daughter-in-law is unrelated to the children of her mother-in-law, so \u2013 evolutionarily \u2013 has no motivation to contribute to their survival. For the mother-in-law there\u2019s a trade-off as she has 25% of genes in common with her grandchildren. And so if at some point in ancient history a \u201cmenopause gene\u201d emerged, it would carry the evolutionary advantage of boosting the chances of survival of grandchildren.</p> <p>\u201cOur modelling work showed that such costs of two women reproducing simultaneously in the same household were sufficient to generate selection against continued reproduction beyond 51 years,\u201d Lummaa says.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting to note that this evolutionary trade-off only happens when males continue to live with their families as adults. Lummaa\u2019s team studied Asian elephants employed in timber camps in Myanmar and found that calves survived better if their grandmother was nearby. However, Asian elephants do not show a clear-cut menopause and have been observed to reproduce into their late 60s.</p> <p>A crucial difference could be that elephants live in matriarchal herds, led by a dominant older female. So, thanks, prehistoric patriarchy.</p> <h2>Do other animals have a menopause?</h2> <p>There are a few contenders \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/508-study-guppies-menopause.html\" title=\"\">guppies</a> gasp on for a few weeks after their last litter, which some have suggested is the fish menopause. But whales are the only real parallel. Killer whales, short-finned pilot whales, belugas and narwhals all live substantial periods beyond their reproductive years.</p> <h2>What treatments are available?</h2> <p>The main one is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Hot flushes and other symptoms are caused by the loss of oestrogen in the body as the ovaries stop producing it. However, oestrogen causes the womb lining to grow, which raises the risk of endometrial cancer. To protect the lining of the uterus, combined HRT is normally given, which contains progesterone as well. It can be taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants.</p> <h2>What are the pros and cons of HRT?</h2> <p>Pros: controls menopause symptoms really effectively.</p> <p>Cons: increases the chances that a woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/23/combined-hrt-increases-breast-cancer-risk-nearly-300\" title=\"\">will get breast cancer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/13/hrt-treatment-raises-risk-ovarian-cancer-study\" title=\"\">ovarian cancer</a>. The extent of this cancer risk has been at the heart of the controversy surrounding HRT. A <a href=\"https://www.icr.ac.uk/news-archive/effect-of-combined-hrt-on-breast-cancer-risk-likely-to-have-been-underestimated-new-study-finds\" title=\"\">large study</a> by the Institute of Cancer Research in London found that women who took combined HRT for five years were 2.7 times more likely to get breast cancer than those who did not. Other studies have found slightly lower increases in risk. However, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/13/hrt-will-not-shorten-lives-women-told-after-new-research-published\" title=\"\">major study last year</a> found that HRT does not shorten lives \u2013 so while women on HRT were more likely to develop breast cancer they are not more likely to die at a younger age.</p> <p>Also, on stopping HRT some but not all women will experience a return of menopause symptoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Is%20it%20possible%20to%20delay%20the%20menopause%3F&amp;description=The%20menopause%20typically%20strikes%20between%20the%20age%20of%2045%20and%2055%2C%20but%20a%20new%20medical%20procedure%20has%20been%20launched%20by%20IVF%20specialists%20that%20could%20delay%20onset%20by%20up%20to%2020%20years.%0A%0AThe%20procedure%20involves%20removing%20and%20freezing%20ovarian%20tissue%20in%20younger%20women%20and%20then%20grafting%20it%20back%20into%20the%20body%20as%20the%20menopause%20strikes.%20Provided%20the%20ovarian%20tissue%20survives%20the%20process%2C%20it%20should%20restore%20the%20woman%E2%80%99s%20declining%20sex%20hormones%20and%20halt%20the%20menopause.%0A%0ANine%20women%20have%20so%20far%20had%20the%20procedure.%20Beyond%20postponing%20menopause%2C%20the%20doctors%20believe%20the%20procedure%20could%20save%20the%20NHS%20substantial%20amounts%20of%20money%20by%20reducing%20treatment%20costs%20for%20more%20serious%2C%20related%20problems%20such%20as%20heart%20conditions%20and%20osteoporosis.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Fact box 2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Is%20it%20possible%20to%20delay%20the%20menopause%3F&description=The%20menopause%20typically%20strikes%20between%20the%20age%20of%2045%20and%2055%2C%20but%20a%20new%20medical%20procedure%20has%20been%20launched%20by%20IVF%20specialists%20that%20could%20delay%20onset%20by%20up%20to%2020%20years.%0A%0AThe%20procedure%20involves%20removing%20and%20freezing%20ovarian%20tissue%20in%20younger%20women%20and%20then%20grafting%20it%20back%20into%20the%20body%20as%20the%20menopause%20strikes.%20Provided%20the%20ovarian%20tissue%20survives%20the%20process%2C%20it%20should%20restore%20the%20woman%E2%80%99s%20declining%20sex%20hormones%20and%20halt%20the%20menopause.%0A%0ANine%20women%20have%20so%20far%20had%20the%20procedure.%20Beyond%20postponing%20menopause%2C%20the%20doctors%20believe%20the%20procedure%20could%20save%20the%20NHS%20substantial%20amounts%20of%20money%20by%20reducing%20treatment%20costs%20for%20more%20serious%2C%20related%20problems%20such%20as%20heart%20conditions%20and%20osteoporosis.&link=false\">Fact box 2</a> </figure>  <h2>Are there other treatment options?</h2> <p>Some people find alternative therapies such as <a href=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD007410/MENSTR_acupuncture-for-menopausal-hot-flushes\" title=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD007410/MENSTR_acupuncture-for-menopausal-hot-flushes\">acupuncture</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD001395/MENSTR_phytoestrogens-for-vasomotor-menopausal-symptoms\" title=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD001395/MENSTR_phytoestrogens-for-vasomotor-menopausal-symptoms\">phytoestrogens</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD007244/MENSTR_black-cohosh-cimicifuga-spp.-for-menopausal-symptoms\" title=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD007244/MENSTR_black-cohosh-cimicifuga-spp.-for-menopausal-symptoms\">black cohosh</a> helpful, although systematic reviews have not found strong evidence to support these approaches making a measurable difference.</p> <p>There is some evidence that psychological approaches can help. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/12/workplaces-should-cater-for-menopause-as-they-do-for-pregnancy\" title=\"\">A team </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/12/workplaces-should-cater-for-menopause-as-they-do-for-pregnancy\" title=\"\">of researchers published a study </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/12/workplaces-should-cater-for-menopause-as-they-do-for-pregnancy\" title=\"\">last year</a> that showed when women were offered cognitive behavioural therapy and support on how to discuss the menopause at work, 82% said the intervention had reduced the impact of their symptoms.</p> <p>There are also new drugs on the horizon that work in different ways to HRT. One of the most promising is a compound called MLE4901, originally developed by AstraZeneca. It targets a chemical in the brain called neurokinin B, which is known to increase in response to oestrogen deficiency. The idea is that it would control symptoms without affecting hormone levels \u2013 and so hopefully sidestepping the downsides of HRT.</p> <p>A trial, published by a team at Imperial College London, recruited women who were having seven or more hot flushes a day. The drug resulted in a 73% decrease in hot flushes. That trial and one other have prompted interest from big pharma. </p> <p>Astellas, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, is now running a phase 2 trial. \u201cIt works ridiculously well,\u201d says Waljit Dhillo, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism at Imperial, who led the trial. \u201cThe patients in our study were saying please can we carry on with the drug.\u201d</p> <h2>So, is there anything to look forward to?</h2> <p>It\u2019s clearly subjective, but many women would view no more periods and not needing to worry about unplanned pregnancies as positives. There is also evidence that women generally feel good post-menopause. One study by Australian scientists, which followed women for 20 years from the early 1990s found that negative mood scores and depressive symptoms decreased significantly as they transitioned from midlife (50\u201364) to late-life (over 65).</p> <h2>Suggested reading</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.abebooks.co.uk/Menopause-Complete-Guide-Maintaining-Health-Well-being/1508777914/bd\" title=\"\">Menopause: The Complete Guide to Maintaining Health and Well-being and Managing Your Life</a>, by Miriam Stoppard</p> <p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Hot_Flushes_Cold_Science.html?id=TQ8_lWAZBPwC&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Hot Flushes Cold Science: A History of the Modern Menopause</a>, by Louise Foxcroft</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45727610-galloping-catastrophe\" title=\"\">Galloping Catastrophe: Musings of a Menopausal Woman</a>, by Jennifer Kennedy</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is the menopause? The menopause is when a woman\u2019s fertile period comes to a halt. This is generally a gradual process over months or even years, but technically the menopause is defined as when a woman has gone 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for this happening is 52 years, but about one in 100 women have a menopause before the age of 40. How does the body know when to start ramping things down? The menopause is programmed into female biology. It begins when the ovaries have too few eggs to keep powering the ovulation cycle. From childhood, the ovaries have thousands of eggs (200,000, say, but the number varies widely). These cells are constantly moving along a fertility conveyor belt, taking months to grow from primitive follicle to the mature egg which is released during ovulation. The process operates in a knock-out pyramid, with most eggs dying off along the way and only about 400 ever graduating to ovulation. The primordial follicles activate in clusters that grow and compete, with one egg (normally just one) winning out each month. But as women approach the menopause, the remaining follicles become more sparsely spaced. Beyond some critical threshold, they are no longer packed densely enough to exchange the chemical signals with their neighbours that allow them to activate in clusters. So even though eggs remain, they are dormant. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re losing their friends,\u201d says Prof Evelyn Telfer, of the University of Edinburgh. \u201cWhen the woman gets older and when there\u2019s a very low number they just don\u2019t activate.\u201d The follicles release oestrogen as they grow. So when they stop maturing, there is a steep drop in the levels of the hormone being produced, and that\u2019s what leads to menopausal symptoms. How long does the typical menopause last? Symptoms usually start a few months or years before a woman\u2019s periods stop \u2013 a phase known as the perimenopause \u2013 and on average last about four years from the last period. However, around one in 10 women experience symptoms for up to 12 years. What are the symptoms? The first indication of the menopause is a change in the normal pattern of a woman\u2019s periods \u2013 they may become either unusually light or heavy and could arrive with shorter breaks or be absent for months at a time. Hot flushes are the most striking symptom, although they don\u2019t affect everyone. About 20% of women report having none at all, about 80% have some and about 25% have hot flushes that are problematic. They normally involve a rush of heat over the upper body and face, sweating and possibly a reddened blotchy appearance. Night sweats can disturb sleep. Trying to disguise or distract from hot flushes in the workplace as a result of actual or perceived stigma around the menopause can be stressful and affect confidence. Other symptoms include vaginal dryness, changes in libido, mood swings, memory problems and higher risk of osteoporosis. Can a woman still have a baby after menopause? It is possible, through IVF treatment using either eggs frozen pre-menopause or donor eggs. Biomedical progress might open up other options. Post-menopause, women still have hundreds of follicles left in the ovaries and scientists have demonstrated that it is possible to grow these follicles into mature eggs in the lab. A Japanese team is using a version of this technique in a clinical trial of an experimental fertility treatment called IV-activation, in which ovarian tissue is extracted, treated in the lab to encourage the follicles to mature and then grafted back into the ovary. They speculate that in the future, post-menopausal women might be able to have babies using such treatment. Can a woman predict when she\u2019s going to hit the menopause? The age at which a woman enters menopause is partly inherited. So asking your mother or grandmother is a good place to start. Some clinics offer ultrasound tests aimed at assessing the ovarian reserve. The scans can only see the most mature egg cells \u2013 the follicles are too small to spot \u2013 and the tests are not very accurate at predicting when the menopause will begin. Scientists are identifying ever more genes that contribute to the age menopause begins, but since it is a trait that is influenced by a large number of genes, it is not yet possible to get an accurate readout from a genetic test. In terms of evolution, what\u2019s the point of the menopause? One of the most compelling evolutionary explanations for menopause is the \u201creproductive conflict hypothesis\u201d. The idea is that when multiple generations live together in a patrilocal set up (that\u2019s to say, a woman moving in with her husband\u2019s parents), a woman would compete with her mother-in-law for the resources needed for babies and children if their reproductive schedules overlapped. Research by Prof Virpi Lummaa, of the University of Turku in Finland, using a 200-year dataset on pre-industrial Finns, showed that simultaneous reproduction by daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law was linked to a far worse chance of children surviving. The daughter-in-law is unrelated to the children of her mother-in-law, so \u2013 evolutionarily \u2013 has no motivation to contribute to their survival. For the mother-in-law there\u2019s a trade-off as she has 25% of genes in common with her grandchildren. And so if at some point in ancient history a \u201cmenopause gene\u201d emerged, it would carry the evolutionary advantage of boosting the chances of survival of grandchildren. \u201cOur modelling work showed that such costs of two women reproducing simultaneously in the same household were sufficient to generate selection against continued reproduction beyond 51 years,\u201d Lummaa says. It\u2019s interesting to note that this evolutionary trade-off only happens when males continue to live with their families as adults. Lummaa\u2019s team studied Asian elephants employed in timber camps in Myanmar and found that calves survived better if their grandmother was nearby. However, Asian elephants do not show a clear-cut menopause and have been observed to reproduce into their late 60s. A crucial difference could be that elephants live in matriarchal herds, led by a dominant older female. So, thanks, prehistoric patriarchy. Do other animals have a menopause? There are a few contenders \u2013 guppies gasp on for a few weeks after their last litter, which some have suggested is the fish menopause. But whales are the only real parallel. Killer whales, short-finned pilot whales, belugas and narwhals all live substantial periods beyond their reproductive years. What treatments are available? The main one is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Hot flushes and other symptoms are caused by the loss of oestrogen in the body as the ovaries stop producing it. However, oestrogen causes the womb lining to grow, which raises the risk of endometrial cancer. To protect the lining of the uterus, combined HRT is normally given, which contains progesterone as well. It can be taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants. What are the pros and cons of HRT? Pros: controls menopause symptoms really effectively. Cons: increases the chances that a woman will get breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The extent of this cancer risk has been at the heart of the controversy surrounding HRT. A large study by the Institute of Cancer Research in London found that women who took combined HRT for five years were 2.7 times more likely to get breast cancer than those who did not. Other studies have found slightly lower increases in risk. However, a major study last year found that HRT does not shorten lives \u2013 so while women on HRT were more likely to develop breast cancer they are not more likely to die at a younger age. Also, on stopping HRT some but not all women will experience a return of menopause symptoms. Are there other treatment options? Some people find alternative therapies such as acupuncture, phytoestrogens or black cohosh helpful, although systematic reviews have not found strong evidence to support these approaches making a measurable difference. There is some evidence that psychological approaches can help. A team of researchers published a study last year that showed when women were offered cognitive behavioural therapy and support on how to discuss the menopause at work, 82% said the intervention had reduced the impact of their symptoms. There are also new drugs on the horizon that work in different ways to HRT. One of the most promising is a compound called MLE4901, originally developed by AstraZeneca. It targets a chemical in the brain called neurokinin B, which is known to increase in response to oestrogen deficiency. The idea is that it would control symptoms without affecting hormone levels \u2013 and so hopefully sidestepping the downsides of HRT. A trial, published by a team at Imperial College London, recruited women who were having seven or more hot flushes a day. The drug resulted in a 73% decrease in hot flushes. That trial and one other have prompted interest from big pharma. Astellas, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, is now running a phase 2 trial. \u201cIt works ridiculously well,\u201d says Waljit Dhillo, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism at Imperial, who led the trial. \u201cThe patients in our study were saying please can we carry on with the drug.\u201d So, is there anything to look forward to? It\u2019s clearly subjective, but many women would view no more periods and not needing to worry about unplanned pregnancies as positives. There is also evidence that women generally feel good post-menopause. One study by Australian scientists, which followed women for 20 years from the early 1990s found that negative mood scores and depressive symptoms decreased significantly as they transitioned from midlife (50\u201364) to late-life (over 65).

Local activists have made many attempts to improve the situation around the square, such as planting trees, organising screenings and concerts, and making night patrols, but many acknowledge the situation has deteriorated in recent months. Together with the squat evictions and anti-drug operations, authorities have announced plans that include repainting graffiti-covered areas and improving street lighting \u2013 none of which require evictions, activists argue. The Hellenic Police refused to comment on specific operations. Despite ongoing threats, no evictions have yet occurred this summer. However, there has been a noticeable escalation of police activity in the area, with almost daily operations on and around the square. Those arrested for immigration violations have been taken into detention. New Democracy have announced they will start deporting failed asylum applicants. \u201cThey have used criminality, prejudice towards refugees and even accusations of terrorism to discredit the left resistance in Exarcheia,\u201d says Panos*, an activist who helped open Notara 26 back in 2015. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think they will be successful. The political cost will be great and where are they going to relocate all the refugee children and families? The camps are full.\u2019\u2019 Athens has emptied for the summer. Shops are closed and it feels like a hot and sticky ghost town. But on Exarcheia Square, there is a palpable air of tension, as those gathered know another police operation could occur at any moment. Around the corner, the boarded-up Azadi squat, empty since the April evictions, has been covered with a mural depicting anarchists facing off against riot police and the slogan: \u201cExarcheia will win.\u201d Time will tell. *Names of interviewees have been changed to protect their identities.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Priti Patel, has been urged to withdraw from cabinet discussions about a lucrative \u00a36bn defence contract, after it emerged that the US company that paid her \u00a31,000 an hour to advise it plans to bid for the work. Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 home affairs spokesperson, said the fact that Patel had worked for Viasat in the period running up to her appointment as home secretary created the risk of a conflict of interest now she was in government. The Californian company has declared it wants to bid on the contract to supply next-generation military satellite communication systems, called Skynet 6, in a bidding process run by the Ministry of Defence that is expected to start next year. Jardine called on Patel to clarify whether she \u201chas had any conversations about the [Ministry of Defence] contract with anyone there\u201d and demanded the home secretary \u201crecuse herself from any cabinet or national security council discussions concerning the firm\u201d. Viasat spelled out its interest in bidding for Skynet 6 in a corporate blog from February which quotes a company executive saying that the UK has \u201can enormous opportunity\u201d to deploy expertise from \u201cprivate sector \u2026 providers, including Viasat\u201d. Patel originally declared on 3 June, when she was a backbencher, that she worked as a \u201cstrategic adviser\u201d to Viasat from 1 May to 31 July, earning \u00a35,000 a month for \u201can expected commitment\u201d of about five hours a month. That prompted the Lib Dems to ask her to \u201cimmediately confirm when her work with Viasat ended\u201d, because that appeared to overlap with the Brexiter\u2019s appointment as home secretary on 24 July. A subsequent declaration, made on 31 July, once she had become a minister, shortened the time she was under contract to the communications company to the end of June, suggesting that she had not worked for Viasat during July. Although the Skynet contract falls under the Ministry of Defence, opposition politicians believe that such a strategically significant procurement could be discussed across government with other ministers responsible for national security. Jardine said: \u201cThe British public cannot have confidence that this multibillion-pound defence contract will be decided in the national interest while one of the cabinet ministers in the discussions was until very recently a paid adviser to one of the companies bidding for it.\u201d Home Office sources said Patel had been \u201cthrough a full process\u201d of examination by the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), the body that monitors private sector employment by ministers and ex-ministers, and that \u201cno issues were raised\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The decade has not been kind to Manteigas. Nestled in the mountains in the Portuguese interior, this pretty town has suffered a familiar kind of slow-motion decline.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnce the factories started closing, then the schools closed, the shops closed, even the chapel closed,\u201d says Maria Jos\u00e9 Santos Salvado, a wizard with needle and thread who was laid off as a textile patcher when her factory shut in 2011. \u201cAll the young people left. Manteigas became a town of old people.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a common enough story in southern Europe, where rural decline is a long-term tendency that has accelerated since the financial crisis.</p> \n<p>But are fortunes about to reverse for people like Salvado? After the surprise intervention of a husband-and-wife team from Lisbon, the looms of her old factory are chugging noisily once again. With orders streaming in from as far afield as Japan, her deft skills are in higher demand than ever.</p> \n<p>Isabel Costa, formerly a high-flyer in Portugal\u2019s corporate retail sector, and her lawyer husband, Jo\u00e3o, are among a small but growing number of investors turning their eye to Portugal\u2019s rural interior.</p> \n<p>It is no easy task. Years of economic decline following the 2008 banking crisis, coupled with harsh government austerity measures, have hit the country\u2019s rural regions especially hard. Between 2014 and 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PRT/portugal/rural-population\">population of Portugal\u2019s interior</a> declined by 5.6% as birth rates stalled and young people left. Business activity (or lack of it) has followed suit.</p> \n<p>Although Portugal\u2019s economy is now finally getting back on its feet again (GDP grew by <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-performance-and-forecasts/economic-performance-country/portugal/economic-forecast-portugal_en\">2.8% in 2018</a>), the vast bulk of this growth is concentrated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/lisbon\">Lisbon</a> and a handful of other (mostly coastal) cities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"017e13c4-d4de-44e7-b5ad-764f9b728e2b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In many parts of Europe, the issue of depopulation of the countryside, regions, or in some cases whole countries, weighs on the minds of politicians and the public, as an era of freedom of movement means more people are able to migrate to find better opportunities.</p>\n    <p>A recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations showed that in Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and Romania, countries where the population has either declined sharply or is flatlining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/europe-south-and-east-worry-more-about-emigration-than-immigration-poll\">more people are worried about emigration than they are about immigration</a>.</p>\n    <p>The problem is felt acutely in central and eastern Europe, where populations have shrunk dramatically in the decades since the fall of communism, due in part to the traumatic effects of the transition, with high mortality rates, low birth rates, and millions of people travelling to western Europe to seek higher salaries, especially in the years after EU accession. In Bulgaria, for example, the population has shrunk from 9 million to 7 million since 1989.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMore and more people are investing in the interior of Portugal \u2026 but they need to look at these projects almost as a kind of mission, not as a way of getting rich,\u201d advises Costa.</p> \n<p>This is true of her own venture, which, despite growing year-on-year, was never designed to be a major money-spinner. Indeed, its origins were more coincidental than commercial. Costa had placed an order with a local manufacturer for burel wool \u2013 a historical speciality of Portugal\u2019s mountainous Serra da Estrela region.</p> \n<p>She quickly discovered that the manufacturer was in a \u201cbad situation\u201d and agreed to buy its working looms and its back catalogue of patterns. She rented a disused factory space owned by the local council, re-hired 15 of the firm\u2019s employees, and restarted operations. <br><br>With some luck (Microsoft hired her to refit its Lisbon headquarters) and plenty of hard work (she spends half the year travelling to trade shows), Costa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.burelfactory.com/en/\">Burel Mountain</a><a href=\"https://www.burelfactory.com/en/\"> Originals</a> brand now employs more than 60 people and supplies two high-end stores in Lisbon and Porto.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t just sit back and see this incredible heritage destroyed. I couldn\u2019t sleep knowing about this problem and doing nothing to retain the area\u2019s industrial history and to teach the next generation,\u201d says Costa, who also owns two boutique mountain hotels close to Manteigas.</p> \n<p>Catarina Vieira is of a similar mind. A former finance manager from the coastal city of Aveiro, she owns a modest six-chalet <em>quinta, </em>or estate, near the town of Seia and is a vocal proponent of Portugal\u2019s nascent eco-tourism market.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21abe1c5da578848da9a4c398714aed5ed835a76\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21abe1c5da578848da9a4c398714aed5ed835a76/0_275_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burel Mountains Originals factory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costa rented a disused factory space owned by the local council, re-hired 15 of the firm\u2019s employees, and restarted operations.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rupert Eden/Burel PR Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.chaodorio.pt/en-gb\">Chao do Rio</a> is the polar opposite of the vast, package-holiday complexes that now litter the Algarve. The food she serves is all locally sourced, the swimming pool is \u201cbiological\u201d (read: unchlorinated and teeming with frogs), and the only loud music you will hear is the sound of birdsong.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe whole idea behind projects like ours is that they are on a small scale and they show concern for the environment and social awareness,\u201d says Vieira. <br><br>Her vision of a small-scale, culturally-sensitive mode of development is shared by many of those investing in Portugal\u2019s interior. Like Bruno Vargas. A 41-year-old former marketeer, he jacked in his city job five years ago to run a four-hectare farm in Rio Maior, a village located in the Centro region. <br><br>His venture, <a href=\"http://www.herbas.pt/\">Herbas Organic Herbs</a>, specialises in hand-crafted aromatic tea infusions. Business is good. He exports to various European countries and employs seasonal labour from the local area. By his own admission, however, the venture grew out of the \u201cromantic idea\u201d of a more balanced lifestyle as much as turning a profit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

That\u2019s not turned out to be true, of course. If you have a business, you have pressures, but at least my mind is clearer about why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d he says. <br><br>Not all embrace this pared-down model of rural development. The Portuguese government provides warm words, for instance, but little in the shape of financial support. Such public investment as exists for rural enterprise development tends to come from the European Union.</p> \n<p>To get started, for example, Vargas received \u20ac40,000 (\u00a337,000) in seed-funding from <a href=\"http://www.proder.pt/\">ProDer</a> \u2013 a nationally-managed fund for rural development primarily financed by the EU. Costa and Vieira also received help from the same fund. <br><br>Even less sympathetic are large-scale investors, for whom big is \u2013 as ever \u2013 beautiful.

      "bodyText": "The decade has not been kind to Manteigas. Nestled in the mountains in the Portuguese interior, this pretty town has suffered a familiar kind of slow-motion decline. \u201cOnce the factories started closing, then the schools closed, the shops closed, even the chapel closed,\u201d says Maria Jos\u00e9 Santos Salvado, a wizard with needle and thread who was laid off as a textile patcher when her factory shut in 2011. \u201cAll the young people left. Manteigas became a town of old people.\u201d It\u2019s a common enough story in southern Europe, where rural decline is a long-term tendency that has accelerated since the financial crisis. But are fortunes about to reverse for people like Salvado? After the surprise intervention of a husband-and-wife team from Lisbon, the looms of her old factory are chugging noisily once again. With orders streaming in from as far afield as Japan, her deft skills are in higher demand than ever. Isabel Costa, formerly a high-flyer in Portugal\u2019s corporate retail sector, and her lawyer husband, Jo\u00e3o, are among a small but growing number of investors turning their eye to Portugal\u2019s rural interior. It is no easy task. Years of economic decline following the 2008 banking crisis, coupled with harsh government austerity measures, have hit the country\u2019s rural regions especially hard. Between 2014 and 2017, the population of Portugal\u2019s interior declined by 5.6% as birth rates stalled and young people left. Business activity (or lack of it) has followed suit. Although Portugal\u2019s economy is now finally getting back on its feet again (GDP grew by 2.8% in 2018), the vast bulk of this growth is concentrated in Lisbon and a handful of other (mostly coastal) cities. \u201cMore and more people are investing in the interior of Portugal \u2026 but they need to look at these projects almost as a kind of mission, not as a way of getting rich,\u201d advises Costa. This is true of her own venture, which, despite growing year-on-year, was never designed to be a major money-spinner. Indeed, its origins were more coincidental than commercial. Costa had placed an order with a local manufacturer for burel wool \u2013 a historical speciality of Portugal\u2019s mountainous Serra da Estrela region. She quickly discovered that the manufacturer was in a \u201cbad situation\u201d and agreed to buy its working looms and its back catalogue of patterns. She rented a disused factory space owned by the local council, re-hired 15 of the firm\u2019s employees, and restarted operations. With some luck (Microsoft hired her to refit its Lisbon headquarters) and plenty of hard work (she spends half the year travelling to trade shows), Costa\u2019s Burel Mountain Originals brand now employs more than 60 people and supplies two high-end stores in Lisbon and Porto. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just sit back and see this incredible heritage destroyed. I couldn\u2019t sleep knowing about this problem and doing nothing to retain the area\u2019s industrial history and to teach the next generation,\u201d says Costa, who also owns two boutique mountain hotels close to Manteigas. Catarina Vieira is of a similar mind. A former finance manager from the coastal city of Aveiro, she owns a modest six-chalet quinta, or estate, near the town of Seia and is a vocal proponent of Portugal\u2019s nascent eco-tourism market. Chao do Rio is the polar opposite of the vast, package-holiday complexes that now litter the Algarve. The food she serves is all locally sourced, the swimming pool is \u201cbiological\u201d (read: unchlorinated and teeming with frogs), and the only loud music you will hear is the sound of birdsong. \u201cThe whole idea behind projects like ours is that they are on a small scale and they show concern for the environment and social awareness,\u201d says Vieira. Her vision of a small-scale, culturally-sensitive mode of development is shared by many of those investing in Portugal\u2019s interior. Like Bruno Vargas. A 41-year-old former marketeer, he jacked in his city job five years ago to run a four-hectare farm in Rio Maior, a village located in the Centro region. His venture, Herbas Organic Herbs, specialises in hand-crafted aromatic tea infusions. Business is good. He exports to various European countries and employs seasonal labour from the local area. By his own admission, however, the venture grew out of the \u201cromantic idea\u201d of a more balanced lifestyle as much as turning a profit. \u201cI had the idea that it would be a different kind of life, with more time for my family and less pressures. That\u2019s not turned out to be true, of course. If you have a business, you have pressures, but at least my mind is clearer about why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d he says. Not all embrace this pared-down model of rural development. The Portuguese government provides warm words, for instance, but little in the shape of financial support. Such public investment as exists for rural enterprise development tends to come from the European Union. To get started, for example, Vargas received \u20ac40,000 (\u00a337,000) in seed-funding from ProDer \u2013 a nationally-managed fund for rural development primarily financed by the EU. Costa and Vieira also received help from the same fund. Even less sympathetic are large-scale investors, for whom big is \u2013 as ever \u2013 beautiful. Despite being located in an officially designated natural park, for instance, Manteigas is soon to have a huge, luxury hotel constructed in the wooded glacial valley overlooking the town. In a similar vein, international mining firms are now sniffing around. It transpires that Portugal\u2019s central belt is especially \u201cblessed\u201d with reserves of lithium, the alkali metal used in batteries for smartphones and electric cars. \u201cIf mega-mining comes to the centre of Portugal, it will spoil everything. We really need to cherish these small projects and put away these crazy dreams of Portugal as the future Arabia,\u201d says Vieira. The economists would disagree, arguing that mega-mining and commercial tourism promise far higher levels of capital investment and job creation. The central government, which campaigners fear is poised to greenlight a lithium mine on the edge of Serra da Estrela, appears to agree. From his holistic yoga retreat near T\u00e1bua, in the district of Coimbra, Tony Speirs is watching with anxiety. Originally from north Wales, he set up shop in central Portugal a decade ago. Over that time, he has seen large-scale commercial investment completely alter the once sleepy coastline of the Algarve. He hopes his neighbours will take note and opt for a different route. As he himself readily admits, micro-enterprises like his will not transform Portugal\u2019s rustic interior into dynamos of economic development. But they are helping spark into life pockets of entrepreneurial vitality. For Speirs, that\u2019s enough.

      "body": "<p>As the world watches in horror and terror as the Amazon burns, scientists have made clear that the cause, principally if not entirely, is human activity.</p> <p>Here in Brazil, that human activity has human names and faces: those of Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, and his extremist environment minister, Ricardo Salles. They have not merely permitted these devastating fires, but have encouraged and fueled them.</p> <p>They have done so with a toxic brew of radical ideology, political corruption and banal greed. Put simply, the ongoing destruction of the Amazon is taking place because of policy choices made by those who now rule Brazil.</p> <p>The magnitude of these fires, and the severity of the dangers they pose to the world, have been widely demonstrated over the last week. As the New York Times reported on Wednesday, the National Institute for Space Research documented that it \u201chad detected 39,194 fires this year in the world\u2019s largest rain forest, a 77% increase from the same period in 2018\u201d.</p> <p>The raging fires have become so potent that the smoke they generate plunged the western hemisphere\u2019s largest city, S\u00e3o Paulo, into total darkness in the middle of the day on Tuesday. What was particularly shocking about that sudden event was that the Amazonian fires are hundreds of miles away from that city, but have become so dense and overwhelming that they snuffed out light in that distant major metropolis.</p> <p>To the extent one can locate any silver lining in this literal dark cloud, it is that the cause of these fires are almost entirely manmade, which means they can be stopped with changes in human behavior \u2013 specifically, with policy changes by Brazil\u2019s new government.</p> <p>Bolsonaro\u2019s election victory last November was a shock to the Brazilian political system because, as a congressman for almost 30 years, his retrograde and unhinged views had relegated him to the fringe of politics life. His presence in the congress was regarded by most as a national embarrassment; that he would one day occupy the presidential palace was unthinkable.</p> <p>But as has happened in numerous other countries in the democratic world, including the US, a series of crises and failures validly attributed to the establishment class have driven large sections of the country\u2019s population into the arms of any self-styled outsider, no matter how demagogic and radical.</p> <p>Among Bolsonaro\u2019s many extremist views is climate denialism as stubborn and extreme as any prominent world figure, if not more so. He has long dismissed the scientific consensus about climate scenarios as a hoax. And he campaigned on an explicit pledge to exploit \u2013 ie destroy \u2013 the Amazon, which currently provides 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen and which climate scientists widely regard as the most valuable asset humanity possesses in our increasingly difficult battle to avoid climate catastrophes.</p> <p>Since his election, Bolsonaro has not only made good on his promises to fundamentally subvert our country\u2019s long-standing commitment to protect the Amazon, but has done so with a speed and aggression that has surprised even his most virulent critics. To be sure, Bolsonaro\u2019s predecessors \u2013 including those from the center-left Workers\u2019 Party \u2013 have earned their share of valid criticisms from environmentalists for harming the Amazon for industrial gain. But \u2013 after just eight moths in office \u2013 Bolsonaro\u2019s damage to the world\u2019s greatest rain forest is in an entirely different universe of magnitude.</p> <p>Deforestation is an affirmative goal of Bolsonaro. That can be achieved by cutting down trees or, more efficiently, by simply burning large areas that Brazil\u2019s agricultural industry wants to exploit. It also means displacing the indigenous tribes that have lived in those forests for centuries: people for whom Bolsonaro has repeatedly expressed contempt. Their displacement from those lands has often been accomplished with violence against environmental activists and indigenous leaders.</p> <p>Bolsonaro\u2019s choice for his environment minster, Ricardo Salles from the so-called New Party (Partido Novo), exemplifies the radical and even violent anti-environmentalism fueling these fires. Last year, Salles, while serving as a state environmental official in S\u00e3o Paulo, was found guilty of administrative improprieties for having altered a map to benefit mining companies.</p> <p>He was fined and deprived of his political rights \u2013 including his right to seek elected office \u2013 for eight years. Bolsonaro evidently viewed these transgressions as a virtue since he announced his selection of Salles to serve in his cabinet a mere three weeks after his conviction.</p> <p>In 2018, Salles \u2013 now the custodian of the Brazilian Amazon \u2013 ran for federal Congress with a political ad that displayed bullets from a rifle as his solution for environmental activists, indigenous tribes impeding the destruction of their land, and \u201cleftists\u201d. Salles lost his bid for congress, but was rewarded with a much more powerful position: Bolsonaro\u2019s environment minister.</p> <p>Bolsonaro and Salles view deforestation as such a pressing priority that they openly despise anyone who seeks to impede it. Earlier this month, Bolsonaro fired a top scientist after he warned the country that deforestation was taking place at an unprecedented and dangerous rate. Last month, when a reporter asked Bolsonaro about the damage being done to the environment by his industrial policies, the president contemptuously told the reporter he should defecate less: \u201cOne day yes, one day no.\u201d And, in the face of rising political pressure over the Amazonian fires, he infamously, and baselessly, blamed environmental groups this week for having started them.</p> <p>The agencies charged with safeguarding the nearly one million indigenous people in Brazil have suffered such severe budget cuts under Bolsonaro that they are now barely functioning. During the campaign, he vowed: \u201cNot one centimetre will be demarcated for indigenous reserves or quilombolas.\u201d In late July, gold miners invaded an indigenous village and one of its leaders was stabbed to death.</p> <p>All of these dramatic changes have occurred not only from ideology but also political captivity. Along with rightwing evangelicals and supporters of Brazil\u2019s past military dictatorship, Brazil\u2019s powerful agribusiness sector is a critical component of the coalition that swept Bolsonaro into office.</p> <p>Their gamble on Bolsonaro has paid dividends: a huge array of previously banned pesticides has been approved for use this year with virtually no debate or study. One result: the death of 500 million bees in the last three months alone.</p> <p>Worst of all, deforestation is consuming the Amazon at a horrifically rapid pace. As the New York Times put it this week: \u201cThe destruction of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has increased rapidly since the nation\u2019s new far-right president took over and his government scaled back efforts to fight illegal logging, ranching and mining.\u201d</p> <p>The government agency responsible for monitoring deforestation documented the loss of \u201c1,330 sq miles of forest cover in the first half of 2019, a 39% increase over the same period last year\u201d.</p> <p>What the world is witnessing is as deliberate as it is dangerous.

The trend we are observing year-on-year is a steady decrease in terrorist organisations attempting to use our service.\u201d The spokesperson said Twitter was able to ban terrorist accounts by detecting behaviour patterns during account registration, and most accounts were banned during the account setup stage, before the account had even had a chance to tweet. In Facebook\u2019s latest transparency report, it said the amount of content removed increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 2018 (6.4m up from 4.7m) because the site had stepped up its action on such material. Morrison also used the G7 on the weekend to re-announce plans for internet service providers in Australia to block websites hosting terrorist or violent extremist content during events similar to the Christchurch terror attack. Several ISPs blocked sites hosting the Christchurch livestream at the time of the massacre, but did so voluntarily without any legislative backing. The government is now looking to codify this practice so in future, the esafety commissioner can issue determinations to block sites hosting such material. \u201cThis new protocol will better equip our agencies to rapidly detect and shut down the sharing of dangerous material online, even as a crisis may still be unfolding,\u201d the minister for home affairs, Peter Dutton, said in a statement. The esafety commissioner currently has no oversight over whether sites blocked during the Christchurch attack are still being blocked. A spokesperson said it was a matter for the ISPs. One of the sites that had hosted the material, 8chan, has gone dark since DDoS protection provider Cloudflare was pressured to drop the site. But experts have warned 8chan\u2019s users have migrated to the dark web or encrypted messaging apps. The esafety commissioner Julie Inman-Grant and Queensland police service\u2019s Jonathan Rouse also called for companies like Facebook and Google to ensure when they\u2019re developing end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that they\u2019re still able to scan messages (despite being encrypted end-to-end) to check for child abuse material. \u201cThere is a deeply held sentiment among law enforcement agencies and governments around the globe that there needs to be some transparency and robust explanations about how they will mitigate risks to children and the fight against online child exploitation \u2013 so that they do not create a secondary Dark Web through their messaging services,\u201d an esafety commissioner spokesperson told Guardian Australia.",

The restaurants are generally very affordable and for a small city there is a lot of variety. But for something classic, it\u2019s hard to beat <strong><a href=\"https://restauranteojeda.com/\" title=\"\">Ojeda</a></strong>. Slap-bang in the city centre this much-loved restaurant was founded in 1912, and its main dining room, upstairs from the bar, is still the most impressive in the city, decorated with intricately carved wood and cool tiled walls. The lamb chops (<em>chuletillas de lechazo</em>) or the sole (<em>lenguado salva</em><em>je</em>) with basil sauce (both around \u20ac20) are always good, but the <em>lechazo</em> \u2013 milk-fed lamb slow-roasted in a wood-burning oven (prices vary according to weight) \u2013 is something special and, without doubt, the most famous and best dish in the city, and probably the entire province. <br>\u2022 <em>Calle Condestable 2</em><em>, <a href=\"https://restauranteojeda.com/\" title=\"\">restauranteojeda.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Tour the vines</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9592e9a140550618c7d407270137ea92c12c7b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9592e9a140550618c7d407270137ea92c12c7b8c/0_73_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"in ribera del Duero wine  area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Burgos is an excellent base for a tour of the Ribera del Duero, one of Spain\u2019s most famous wine regions.

      "bodyText": "Castilian cuisine Eating out in Burgos is a delight. The restaurants are generally very affordable and for a small city there is a lot of variety. But for something classic, it\u2019s hard to beat Ojeda. Slap-bang in the city centre this much-loved restaurant was founded in 1912, and its main dining room, upstairs from the bar, is still the most impressive in the city, decorated with intricately carved wood and cool tiled walls. The lamb chops (chuletillas de lechazo) or the sole (lenguado salvaje) with basil sauce (both around \u20ac20) are always good, but the lechazo \u2013 milk-fed lamb slow-roasted in a wood-burning oven (prices vary according to weight) \u2013 is something special and, without doubt, the most famous and best dish in the city, and probably the entire province. \u2022 Calle Condestable 2, restauranteojeda.com Tour the vines Burgos is an excellent base for a tour of the Ribera del Duero, one of Spain\u2019s most famous wine regions. An hour\u2019s drive or so south-west of the city takes you into the undulating vine-filled landscape, with its abundance of atmospheric, apricot-coloured small towns. Here, as in its sister region of Rioja, the tempranillo grape is king. Be sure to check out the bodegas of Villacreces (bottles from \u20ac10), Arzuaga (bottles from \u20ac18) and Vega Sicilia, Spain\u2019s most famous wine producer. It\u2019s best to ring in advance to organise a tour. Pincho hopping As in the Basque city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, going for pinchos \u2013 like tapas \u2013 is part of everyday life in Burgos. The best time for a pincho tour is either Thursday or Friday night, or Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Start on Calle San Lorenzo at La Quinta del Monje and order a glass of local Ribera del Duero red wine with a pincho of charcoal-grilled sirloin with foie gras (\u20ac3.50). Then head a few bars up the street to Casa Pancho. Here, order an ice-cold ca\u00f1a (small beer) with a cojonudo, a small piece of bread topped with a quail\u2019s egg, spicy chorizo and red pepper. From there, move on to La Cantina de Burgos and wash down the carabinero (prawn) croquettes or bean stew with a glass of verdejo white wine. Finish at La Favorita for fried lamb sweetbreads, and be sure to try some of the house wines: they are written on a slate board in the middle of the bar (from \u20ac2 a glass). Bloodless bullring Spain has probably the second-strongest basketball league in the world behind the NBA. And San Pablo Burgos, the local team, plays in the country\u2019s top division.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: No such thing as a foregone conclusion</h2> \n<p>Good morning, this is Alison Rourke with your bank holiday briefing.</p> \n<p>The unlikeliest of victories at Headingley yesterday proved that while there is batting, there\u2019s hope. As fans across England accepted the worst was coming, Ben Stokes showed steel at the crease, rarely seen in such calibre in the ground\u2019s long history.

      "bodyText": "Labor and the Greens have accused Angus Taylor of breaching the ministerial code of conduct by not declaring a personal business interest at a meeting about endangered grasslands in 2017. A Senate inquiry heard on Friday that Taylor, now the energy minister, did not disclose his financial interest in the company Jam Land Pty Ltd at a 20 March meeting with senior environment officials and the office of the then environment minister, Josh Frydenberg. The meeting, about the government\u2019s designation of the critically endangered natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands, occurred as Jam Land was under investigation for poisoning about 30 hectares containing the grasslands in the Monaro region of New South Wales. The Labor senator Katy Gallagher said Taylor not disclosing his interest at the meeting was \u201ca clear breach\u201d of his obligations under the statement of ministerial standards. Gallagher and the committee\u2019s chair, Greens senator Janet Rice, also questioned why a senior department official at the meeting did not take notes. \u201cNote taking is a critical function of the public service with clear guidelines outlined in the Code of Conduct. The department is required to provide notes, so where are they?\u201d Rice said. The evidence was heard as part of a Senate inquiry into the faunal extinction crisis. Friday\u2019s hearing focused on Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, following revelations by Guardian Australia about the meeting and later correspondence from Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office asking if protection of the grasslands could be watered down. One of the directors of Jam Land is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother. The minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. Angus Taylor and Frydenberg were both invited to give evidence at Friday\u2019s hearing and declined. Jam Land\u2019s directors \u2013 Richard Taylor, David Mitchell and John Jeffreys \u2013 were also invited to appear and declined, the hearing was told. The assistant secretary of the department\u2019s protected species and communities branch, Geoff Richardson, was one of the officials at the March 2017 meeting. He told Friday\u2019s hearing Taylor did not disclose his business interest at the start of or during the meeting. Richardson also said he did not take notes on the day, but told senators the poisoning investigation \u201cwas not raised, it was not discussed\u201d. Taylor has stated repeatedly that the meeting did not discuss the investigation and was focused on the listing of the grasslands, which he has said was a matter of concern for constituents in his electorate of Hume. \u201cEvery day [Scott] Morrison stands by Mr Taylor is another day he demonstrates his disregard for basic ministerial standards,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cThe stench around this matter grows stronger by the day. Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg have many more questions to answer.\u201d Taylor did not respond to a request for comment by publication deadline. The statement of standards says ministers must \u201cmake arrangements to avoid conflicts of interests arising from their investments\u201d and \u201cit is critical that ministers do not use public office for private purposes\u201d. Ministers must declare any private interests \u201cheld by them or members of their families which give rise to, or are likely to give rise to, a conflict with their public duties\u201d. Gallagher said it was also \u201cunacceptable that no notes were taken by the Department of the Environment and Energy at these crucial meetings\u201d. Guardian Australia asked the department if any other officials at the meeting kept a record. At Friday\u2019s hearing, the inquiry was told that another senior official, Dean Knudson, did not keep notes at a meeting about the matter with Frydenberg and National party members in October 2017. Rice said: \u201cIf ministers Taylor and Frydenberg have nothing to hide, notes of the meeting would have only strengthened their case. \u201cThe department knew compliance action was under way and knew of the familial link between Jam Land and Minister Taylor. No notes were taken. Taylor\u2019s financial interest was not declared. \u201cThe department couldn\u2019t even tell the committee the names of everyone who attended the meeting. The whole thing stinks to high heaven.\u201d A spokesperson for the department said it was standard practice \u201cthat the department takes notes, in particular of any action items, at meetings with external stakeholders\u201d. \u201cAt the meeting Mr Knudson attended, there were no action items and consequently no notes were taken,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAt the meeting Mr Richardson attended there were action emails sent soon after the meeting.\u201d",

In 2017, the state water resources control board of California issued a<a href=\"https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/enforcement/complaints/docs/nestle/roi_final.pdf\"> report of investigation</a> concluding that the company appeared to be diverting water \u201cwithout a valid basis of right\u201d from Strawberry Canyon in the San Bernardino national forest for use in its Arrowhead brand of bottled water.</p> <p>Nestl\u00e9 continues to dispute the finding and is still pumping water there \u2013 45m gallons last year,<a href=\"https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2019/06/13/nestle-still-taking-public-forest-water-its-arrowhead-label-feds-help/1362211001/\"> according to published reports</a>. But in the tussle over whether the company had historic rights to all the water it was taking from the creek, groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, the League of Women Voters and the Save Our Forest Association were critical of Nestl\u00e9 and its operations.</p> <p>In a written statement Nestl\u00e9, which employs 800 people in Florida, said it wanted to address \u201cmisconceptions\u201d about its plans.</p> <p>\u201cWe adhere to all relevant regulatory and state standards. Just like all the previous owners of the High Springs factory which manufactured bottled water and other beverages, we are not taking water from a publicly owned source. Instead we are buying water from a private company which holds the valid water use permit,\u201d spokesman Adam Gaber said, adding that Nestl\u00e9\u2019s water use \u201cwill always remain strictly within the limit set by the permit\u201d.</p> <p>He said that Nestl\u00e9 was also a responsible steward of the environment. \u201cOur business depends on the quality and sustainability of the water we are collecting,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt would make no sense to invest millions of dollars into local operations just to deplete the natural resources on which our business relies.

But the district has its own questions, and wrote to Seven Springs in July for a second time to request answers. \u201cTheir first response we didn\u2019t feel was complete, so we asked for them to go into more detail,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce they respond we will review that information.\u201d Among the items the district wants are an evaluation report of any harm that the project might cause to wetlands, and a documented impact study of Ginnie Springs. The permit cannot be granted, the district says, unless Seven Springs can show that there would be no change in \u201cwater levels or flows of the source spring from the normal rate and range of function\u201d and \u201cno adverse impacts to water quality, vegetation or animal population\u201d. Nestl\u00e9 is no stranger to controversy over its water extraction activities. In 2017, the state water resources control board of California issued a report of investigation concluding that the company appeared to be diverting water \u201cwithout a valid basis of right\u201d from Strawberry Canyon in the San Bernardino national forest for use in its Arrowhead brand of bottled water. Nestl\u00e9 continues to dispute the finding and is still pumping water there \u2013 45m gallons last year, according to published reports. But in the tussle over whether the company had historic rights to all the water it was taking from the creek, groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, the League of Women Voters and the Save Our Forest Association were critical of Nestl\u00e9 and its operations. In a written statement Nestl\u00e9, which employs 800 people in Florida, said it wanted to address \u201cmisconceptions\u201d about its plans. \u201cWe adhere to all relevant regulatory and state standards. Just like all the previous owners of the High Springs factory which manufactured bottled water and other beverages, we are not taking water from a publicly owned source. Instead we are buying water from a private company which holds the valid water use permit,\u201d spokesman Adam Gaber said, adding that Nestl\u00e9\u2019s water use \u201cwill always remain strictly within the limit set by the permit\u201d. He said that Nestl\u00e9 was also a responsible steward of the environment. \u201cOur business depends on the quality and sustainability of the water we are collecting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would make no sense to invest millions of dollars into local operations just to deplete the natural resources on which our business relies. It would undermine the success of our business and go against every value we hold as people and as a company.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Rosanna Arquette sounds panicked. She thinks someone wants to stop our conversation taking place. For 30 minutes, a BBC publicist has tried to patch us into a conference call; now, Arquette has taken matters into her own hands and phoned me directly. \u201cThis is what happens! All the time!\u201d she says, her voice rising. There are no pleasantries. It\u2019s as if we were already talking before I picked up.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is it disconnecting every time?\u201d she asks. \u201cThere is something strange here. Really strange. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. Why can\u2019t we get on the phone with each other?\u201d She laughs, a nervous sort of placeholder laugh.</p> <p>I hesitate before going along with her idea that we have been sabotaged. I had assumed a minor technical hitch. Who would want to stop her talking to me? \u201cAbout a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein</a> documentary?\u201d she scoffs. \u201cA lot of people!\u201d</p> <p>It would be easy to put Arquette\u2019s panic down to paranoia. But as the BBC documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07hby3d\" title=\"\">Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein</a> shows, paranoia is an utterly reasonable response to what she has been through. Directed by <a href=\"http://www.ursulamacfarlane.com/about\" title=\"\">Ursula Macfarlane</a>, the film explores how Weinstein deployed power, right back to his school years. Along with fellow actors and former employees of Weinstein, Arquette contributes her own experience of his alleged sexual abuse. \u201cI guess you have to say allegedly,\u201d she says. Weinstein denies any non-consensual sexual encounters.</p> <p>What Arquette didn\u2019t know, until one of the producers took the finished film to her house, was that the Israeli intelligence firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/harvey-weinstein-israel-intelligence-firm-black-cube\" title=\"\">Black Cube</a> had put together a profile of her for Weinstein. \u201cPhones and getting into computers and emails disappearing \u2013 that stuff continues,\u201d she says (she doesn\u2019t suggest Black Cube is involved). She is \u201cgrateful\u201d to Macfarlane for \u201ca great job\u201d. But \u201ca lot of people have made a lot of money on the backs of our pain\u201d, she says, with the same sad laugh. I think the word \u201cpain\u201d has triggered the laugh, and she could be crying.</p> <p>Arquette was one of the first women to share details of Weinstein\u2019s abuse, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories\" title=\"\">with Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html\" title=\"\">in the New York Times with Jodi Kantor</a>, in October 2017. When the makers of Untouchable contacted her, \u201cEverybody was in so much fear, they didn\u2019t want to speak,\u201d she says. \u201cBut how do you not?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e84c63a4b9d9a3a8a61bd495be347b173875280\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e84c63a4b9d9a3a8a61bd495be347b173875280/0_43_2911_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arquette with Madonna in DesperatelySeeking Susan, 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star on the rise \u2026 Arquette with Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan, 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/ORION PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On camera, she tells of the time in the early 1990s when she arrived at the Beverly Hills hotel in Los Angeles for a meeting with Weinstein. As she does \u2013 and this is something other interviewees in the film do \u2013 she grabs her own wrist and jerks her body back, her hands rising defensively as she mimics his voice; acting, in short, as if Weinstein is physically there, and that she must also play his part.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what trauma is,\u201d she says \u2013 to be recurrently plunged back into the moment that Weinstein, in his white bathrobe, tried to draw her hand first to his achy neck, then his penis. What a relief it must have been to reach the safety of the lift.</p> <p>\u201cI was never safe,\u201d she counters. \u201cFrom the moment I was told that I was supposed to have dinner with him and then I was told: \u2018Mr Weinstein will see you upstairs.\u2019 My heart started racing. Mmmmm.\u201d She makes a sound, a sort of verbal malfunction, an alarm that won\u2019t stop. Of course she didn\u2019t feel safe. She doesn\u2019t feel safe now.</p> <p>Arquette stayed rooted in the doorway of Weinstein\u2019s room. She did not go in. \u201cThat would have been fucked. Game over!\u201d But before she fled, he warned her \u2013 she says this in a deep voice \u2013 \u201c\u2018Rosanna, you\u2019re making a very big mistake.\u2019\u201d She says he named two women whom he claimed had gone along with him in order to advance their careers. One has since told her own story, making it clear that she in fact rebuffed Weinstein, so Arquette sees no harm in naming her.</p> <p>\u201cGwyneth Paltrow,\u201d she says. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018Look what I\u2019ve done for Gwyneth Paltrow.\u2019 Gwyneth Paltrow was with Brad Pitt! She had a career! There\u2019s no way she made a deal with Harvey!\u201d</p> <p>But the claim must have weighed on Arquette because, she says, two years ago, when Farrow\u2019s investigation appeared, she phoned Paltrow.<em> </em>\u201cAnd I said: \u2018I just needed you to know what he said to me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And what did Paltrow say?</p> <p>\u201cShe laughed. She said: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve heard that!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Of course, many people had heard many things about Weinstein. Silence was never the problem. \u201cI told many people,\u201d Arquette says. Who? \u201cI told Jane Fonda years ago. She listened to me and she was concerned \u2026 I talked. I didn\u2019t stop talking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3668efa5c6fc04fac5a917d234e2c00681b2a55d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3668efa5c6fc04fac5a917d234e2c00681b2a55d/0_83_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Weinstein in court in a clip from Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weinstein in court in a clip from Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty/BBC/LT2 Films LTD</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Rose McGowan</a> talked, too, because Arquette heard her account of being raped by Weinstein long before Farrow\u2019s article in 2017; Arquette shared her own experience with a third party, who shared it with McGowan. All these semi-private conversations built a kind of common knowledge, and that was why Farrow knew to approach her, she says. \u201cBut we were in such a fearful place.\u201d Even as she walked away from Weinstein\u2019s corridor and returned to the lobby in the lift, she thought: \u201cHe\u2019s going to take me down.\u201d</p> <p>Arquette has appeared in more than 70 films but the notable ones are Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), The Big Blue (1988), Pulp Fiction (1994) and Crash (1996) \u2013 all long ago. \u201cWell, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/mira-sorvino\" title=\"\">Mira Sorvino</a> says, [Weinstein] took a big chunk of our time in our lives \u2026 There was a significant drop in careers. We\u2019ve gone from the top of A-lists to bottom of the C-minus list within minutes. Gossip ... A dinner party \u2026 \u2018Be careful, she\u2019s a pain in the ass \u2026\u2019 People listen to that. And it\u2019s not true!\u201d</p> <p>Pulp Fiction (produced by Weinstein\u2019s company Miramax) did come two years after the alleged assault; Arquette wanted to work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino\" title=\"\">Quentin Tarantino.</a> \u201cBut I never made a penny from it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the only famous actor who didn\u2019t have a back-end deal [a share of the profits]. And this was a time when I should have \u2026\u201d </p> <p>You were A-list, I say. \u201cI hate saying that,\u201d she says. I suspect she finds it immodest. </p> <p>She has no evidence that Weinstein warned others against her (though Peter Jackson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/15/peter-jackson-harvey-weinstein-ashley-judd-mira-sorvino\" title=\"\">has admitted to blacklisting Sorvino and Ashley Judd</a> under pressure from Weinstein). And there was always work. \u201cEven if it was a bad television movie shooting up in Canada,\u201d she says with that same dry laugh. \u201cYou have to pay the bills when you\u2019re a single mum.\u201d (Her daughter, Zo\u00eb Bleu Sidel, is 24 and, according to Arquette: \u201cShe can run circles around any Arquette as an actor.\u201d Zo\u00eb\u2019s father, restaurateur John Sidel, was the second of Arquette\u2019s four husbands. She has been married to Todd Morgan, an investment banker, since 2013.)</p> <p>In Hollywood, Arquette \u201calways felt isolated\u201d. For a long time, she had no agent, though she has \u201ca wonderful one\u201d now. \u201cI never really played the game, doing what it takes to be a star, to keep your mouth shut\u201d. I wonder if the other Arquette siblings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/patricia-arquette\" title=\"\">Patricia</a>, David (whom she says she speaks to most often), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/alexis-arquette-obituary\" title=\"\">Alexis</a> and Richmond \u2013 shared her sense of isolation? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Patricia does!\u201d she shoots back. \u201cShe\u2019s right there at the top of the field in the game right now.\u201d</p> <p>The speed of her response makes me wonder if it was a competitive household growing up; all the siblings acted. But she says: \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that in our family.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cWait a minute, what am I saying? My dad [Lewis Arquette] had a kind of weird competitiveness with me that I never felt was super-supportive. Everybody would say: \u2018Your dad is so proud of you!\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, he is? Well, that\u2019s nice!\u2019 But he was a struggling actor who never really made it and then his kids all became, you know, stars.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c3ee825bc09aa116077257452b1c167a602bf3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3ee825bc09aa116077257452b1c167a602bf3a/0_212_4517_2710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Acting is in the family \u2026 (l to r) Alexis, Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia and David, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Acting is in the family \u2026 (l to r) Alexis, Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia and David, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SGranitz/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When her trans sister Alexis \u201cwanted to be a woman, I always had a joke. I said: \u2018You think you have a hard time getting work as an actor? Wait till you\u2019re a woman!\u2019 We had a big laugh over that.\u201d</p> <p>A long outward breath ripples down the phone. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get my thoughts in order,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not to be paranoid when you find out that you\u2019ve been spied on.\u201d She goes back to the earlier hitch with the phone call. \u201cSo what happens is, I realise in myself, you get so triggered. The trauma of it. This high anxiety happens, along with a strong morning coffee, and you feel like: \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d She laughs again, but sounds more relaxed.</p> <p>It was Arquette who, as the eldest sibling, launched the <a href=\"https://alexisarquette.com/\" title=\"\">Alexis Arquette Family Foundation</a> after Alexis died from an HIV-related heart attack in 2016. \u201cI felt really moved to do something,\u201d she says. Patricia contributed, \u201cgot a couple of good donations\u201d. But <a href=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/alexis-arquette-male-gender-pronouns-why-did-brother-ex-boyfriend-use-himhe-2415216\" title=\"\">the family appeared to disagree</a> about which pronoun to use: Richmond chose \u201che\u201d in his Facebook post, Patricia \u201cshe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what\u2019s so great about Alexis,\u201d Arquette says. \u201cAlexis was a \u2018they\u2019 before the \u2018they\u2019 pronoun existed.\u201d So which pronoun does the family use now? \u201cI go with what Alexis wanted and that was her choice, and her choice was it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Arquette says. \u201cSo we in our family say \u2018she\u2019. But at the end, Alexis, you know, had a beard. And I said, because Alexis was very ill, I said: \u2018Do you want to be buried in a beautiful, beautiful dress and be made up? Is that what you want?\u2019 \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, Ro. It doesn\u2019t matter. Male or female, I\u2019m just me.\u2019 We got to have that conversation. So I know that Alexis would be \u2018they\u2019 now, if she were alive.\u201d</p> <p>Activism was always central to Arquette family life. Their mother, Brenda Denaut, was an activist. Alexis campaigned for trans rights. Patricia used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/22/patricia-arquette-oscars-speech-equal-pay-women\" title=\"\">her Oscars speech</a> in 2015 to call for wage equality. Way back in 2002, Rosanna made a documentary, Searching for Debra Winger, about the shortage of film roles for older women. \u201cThis is in our DNA,\u201d she says. I suspect even those words are part of the genetic makeup, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/26/patricia-arquette-the-act-interview\" title=\"\">Patricia says exactly the same</a>.</p> <p>Arquette tries not to dwell on the kind of career she might have had. \u201cThis is my karma. It\u2019s for the greater good that it happened to me, because what has become more important in my life is the activism, and being a voice for the voiceless. One of the voices for the voiceless,\u201d she amends. She is scrupulously modest.</p> <p>\u201cThe next step is the healing,\u201d she says. To this end, she is \u201cconstantly\u201d working on her trauma in therapy, and \u201ctalking with other women all the time, every day\u201d about their experiences. Don\u2019t these conversations require her to dwell in the moment of abuse?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dwelling,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still really new. And we have to be diligent and on top of it at all times, because I think men think this is a phase women are going through, and we\u2019re here to tell you, this is never going away. So many women have been abused, and it\u2019s been normalised. We can\u2019t normalise this. It\u2019s not normal!\u201d</p> <p>Still, I worry about the healing part. Arquette seems to feel all allegations of abuse personally. The day after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh\" title=\"\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> hearing, she woke up with shingles. \u201cBecause the stress was so \u2026 It was just too much when he got off!\u201d</p> <p>And she finds it meaningful that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/jeffrey-epstein-death-suicide-prison\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Epstein died</a> on her 60th birthday, as if their fates were entwined. Certainly, she spent her \u201cwhole birthday dealing with a lot of women who were really affected by the fact that Jeffrey Epstein died\u201d. Thankfully, she had \u201ca total rock\u2019n\u2019roll love festival\u201d in her backyard later, attended by activists including Bamby Salcedo, Doctor Astrid Heger, Monica Ramirez and Joni Mitchell. Ellen Barkin was there \u201cin all her glory\u201d.</p> <p>Patricia couldn\u2019t make it \u2013 she was getting over the flu. But Arquette\u2019s daughter Zo\u00eb gave a \u201cbeautiful speech about how she appreciated me and I was always there for her,\u201d Arquette says. And Susanna Hoff from the Bangles played Eternal Flame and Walk Like An Egyptian and Take Me With U by Prince. Arquette is singing it now, quietly: \u201cI don\u2019t care pretty baby, take me with you \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Still, the healing process can\u2019t have been helped by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoArquette/status/1159152878440701952\" title=\"\">her recent tweet</a> that she was \u201csorry\u201d she \u201cwas born white and privileged\u201d. Afterwards, she received so much abuse on social media that she contacted \u201ca really important person who does risk assessments on these sorts of threats\u201d. He wants her \u201cto be very careful about how I say things\u201d, she says, before launching into a clarification. \u201cI\u2019m defending what I said, and if it pisses people off \u2026 Yes, just by the nature of the colour of my skin, I was born with privilege. And it is unfair. And that\u2019s what I meant to say ... Why is it that I was born with privileges just because of the colour of my skin?\u201d</p> <p>She is fighting on so many fronts. She flits from Weinstein to Epstein to Charles Manson to Kavanaugh, mostly in exclamatory bolts. Bearing in mind the threat specialist\u2019s advice, I wonder if she ever considers ...</p> <p>\u201cDo I ever feel like I should shut the fuck up?\u201d she jumps in. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to not speak out. I think as a human being, it\u2019s my job.\u201d</p> <p><em>Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07hby3d\">is on Sunday 1 September at 9pm on BBC Two</a>.</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>This article was amended on 26 August 2019 to correct Untouchable\u2019s screening details.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rosanna Arquette sounds panicked. She thinks someone wants to stop our conversation taking place. For 30 minutes, a BBC publicist has tried to patch us into a conference call; now, Arquette has taken matters into her own hands and phoned me directly. \u201cThis is what happens! All the time!\u201d she says, her voice rising. There are no pleasantries. It\u2019s as if we were already talking before I picked up. \u201cWhy is it disconnecting every time?\u201d she asks. \u201cThere is something strange here. Really strange. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. Why can\u2019t we get on the phone with each other?\u201d She laughs, a nervous sort of placeholder laugh. I hesitate before going along with her idea that we have been sabotaged. I had assumed a minor technical hitch. Who would want to stop her talking to me? \u201cAbout a Harvey Weinstein documentary?\u201d she scoffs. \u201cA lot of people!\u201d It would be easy to put Arquette\u2019s panic down to paranoia. But as the BBC documentary Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein shows, paranoia is an utterly reasonable response to what she has been through. Directed by Ursula Macfarlane, the film explores how Weinstein deployed power, right back to his school years. Along with fellow actors and former employees of Weinstein, Arquette contributes her own experience of his alleged sexual abuse. \u201cI guess you have to say allegedly,\u201d she says. Weinstein denies any non-consensual sexual encounters. What Arquette didn\u2019t know, until one of the producers took the finished film to her house, was that the Israeli intelligence firm Black Cube had put together a profile of her for Weinstein. \u201cPhones and getting into computers and emails disappearing \u2013 that stuff continues,\u201d she says (she doesn\u2019t suggest Black Cube is involved). She is \u201cgrateful\u201d to Macfarlane for \u201ca great job\u201d. But \u201ca lot of people have made a lot of money on the backs of our pain\u201d, she says, with the same sad laugh. I think the word \u201cpain\u201d has triggered the laugh, and she could be crying. Arquette was one of the first women to share details of Weinstein\u2019s abuse, with Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker and in the New York Times with Jodi Kantor, in October 2017. When the makers of Untouchable contacted her, \u201cEverybody was in so much fear, they didn\u2019t want to speak,\u201d she says. \u201cBut how do you not?\u201d On camera, she tells of the time in the early 1990s when she arrived at the Beverly Hills hotel in Los Angeles for a meeting with Weinstein. As she does \u2013 and this is something other interviewees in the film do \u2013 she grabs her own wrist and jerks her body back, her hands rising defensively as she mimics his voice; acting, in short, as if Weinstein is physically there, and that she must also play his part. \u201cThat\u2019s what trauma is,\u201d she says \u2013 to be recurrently plunged back into the moment that Weinstein, in his white bathrobe, tried to draw her hand first to his achy neck, then his penis. What a relief it must have been to reach the safety of the lift. \u201cI was never safe,\u201d she counters. \u201cFrom the moment I was told that I was supposed to have dinner with him and then I was told: \u2018Mr Weinstein will see you upstairs.\u2019 My heart started racing. Mmmmm.\u201d She makes a sound, a sort of verbal malfunction, an alarm that won\u2019t stop. Of course she didn\u2019t feel safe. She doesn\u2019t feel safe now. Arquette stayed rooted in the doorway of Weinstein\u2019s room. She did not go in. \u201cThat would have been fucked. Game over!\u201d But before she fled, he warned her \u2013 she says this in a deep voice \u2013 \u201c\u2018Rosanna, you\u2019re making a very big mistake.\u2019\u201d She says he named two women whom he claimed had gone along with him in order to advance their careers. One has since told her own story, making it clear that she in fact rebuffed Weinstein, so Arquette sees no harm in naming her. \u201cGwyneth Paltrow,\u201d she says. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018Look what I\u2019ve done for Gwyneth Paltrow.\u2019 Gwyneth Paltrow was with Brad Pitt! She had a career! There\u2019s no way she made a deal with Harvey!\u201d But the claim must have weighed on Arquette because, she says, two years ago, when Farrow\u2019s investigation appeared, she phoned Paltrow. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018I just needed you to know what he said to me.\u2019\u201d And what did Paltrow say? \u201cShe laughed. She said: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve heard that!\u2019\u201d Of course, many people had heard many things about Weinstein. Silence was never the problem. \u201cI told many people,\u201d Arquette says. Who? \u201cI told Jane Fonda years ago. She listened to me and she was concerned \u2026 I talked. I didn\u2019t stop talking.\u201d Rose McGowan talked, too, because Arquette heard her account of being raped by Weinstein long before Farrow\u2019s article in 2017; Arquette shared her own experience with a third party, who shared it with McGowan. All these semi-private conversations built a kind of common knowledge, and that was why Farrow knew to approach her, she says. \u201cBut we were in such a fearful place.\u201d Even as she walked away from Weinstein\u2019s corridor and returned to the lobby in the lift, she thought: \u201cHe\u2019s going to take me down.\u201d Arquette has appeared in more than 70 films but the notable ones are Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), The Big Blue (1988), Pulp Fiction (1994) and Crash (1996) \u2013 all long ago. \u201cWell, like Mira Sorvino says, [Weinstein] took a big chunk of our time in our lives \u2026 There was a significant drop in careers. We\u2019ve gone from the top of A-lists to bottom of the C-minus list within minutes. Gossip ... A dinner party \u2026 \u2018Be careful, she\u2019s a pain in the ass \u2026\u2019 People listen to that. And it\u2019s not true!\u201d Pulp Fiction (produced by Weinstein\u2019s company Miramax) did come two years after the alleged assault; Arquette wanted to work with Quentin Tarantino. \u201cBut I never made a penny from it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the only famous actor who didn\u2019t have a back-end deal [a share of the profits]. And this was a time when I should have \u2026\u201d You were A-list, I say. \u201cI hate saying that,\u201d she says. I suspect she finds it immodest. She has no evidence that Weinstein warned others against her (though Peter Jackson has admitted to blacklisting Sorvino and Ashley Judd under pressure from Weinstein). And there was always work. \u201cEven if it was a bad television movie shooting up in Canada,\u201d she says with that same dry laugh. \u201cYou have to pay the bills when you\u2019re a single mum.\u201d (Her daughter, Zo\u00eb Bleu Sidel, is 24 and, according to Arquette: \u201cShe can run circles around any Arquette as an actor.\u201d Zo\u00eb\u2019s father, restaurateur John Sidel, was the second of Arquette\u2019s four husbands. She has been married to Todd Morgan, an investment banker, since 2013.) In Hollywood, Arquette \u201calways felt isolated\u201d. For a long time, she had no agent, though she has \u201ca wonderful one\u201d now. \u201cI never really played the game, doing what it takes to be a star, to keep your mouth shut\u201d. I wonder if the other Arquette siblings \u2013 Patricia, David (whom she says she speaks to most often), Alexis and Richmond \u2013 shared her sense of isolation? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Patricia does!\u201d she shoots back. \u201cShe\u2019s right there at the top of the field in the game right now.\u201d The speed of her response makes me wonder if it was a competitive household growing up; all the siblings acted. But she says: \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that in our family.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cWait a minute, what am I saying? My dad [Lewis Arquette] had a kind of weird competitiveness with me that I never felt was super-supportive. Everybody would say: \u2018Your dad is so proud of you!\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, he is? Well, that\u2019s nice!\u2019 But he was a struggling actor who never really made it and then his kids all became, you know, stars.\u201d When her trans sister Alexis \u201cwanted to be a woman, I always had a joke. I said: \u2018You think you have a hard time getting work as an actor? Wait till you\u2019re a woman!\u2019 We had a big laugh over that.\u201d A long outward breath ripples down the phone. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get my thoughts in order,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not to be paranoid when you find out that you\u2019ve been spied on.\u201d She goes back to the earlier hitch with the phone call. \u201cSo what happens is, I realise in myself, you get so triggered. The trauma of it. This high anxiety happens, along with a strong morning coffee, and you feel like: \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d She laughs again, but sounds more relaxed. It was Arquette who, as the eldest sibling, launched the Alexis Arquette Family Foundation after Alexis died from an HIV-related heart attack in 2016. \u201cI felt really moved to do something,\u201d she says. Patricia contributed, \u201cgot a couple of good donations\u201d. But the family appeared to disagree about which pronoun to use: Richmond chose \u201che\u201d in his Facebook post, Patricia \u201cshe\u201d. \u201cThis is what\u2019s so great about Alexis,\u201d Arquette says. \u201cAlexis was a \u2018they\u2019 before the \u2018they\u2019 pronoun existed.\u201d So which pronoun does the family use now? \u201cI go with what Alexis wanted and that was her choice, and her choice was it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Arquette says. \u201cSo we in our family say \u2018she\u2019. But at the end, Alexis, you know, had a beard. And I said, because Alexis was very ill, I said: \u2018Do you want to be buried in a beautiful, beautiful dress and be made up? Is that what you want?\u2019 \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, Ro. It doesn\u2019t matter. Male or female, I\u2019m just me.\u2019 We got to have that conversation. So I know that Alexis would be \u2018they\u2019 now, if she were alive.\u201d Activism was always central to Arquette family life. Their mother, Brenda Denaut, was an activist. Alexis campaigned for trans rights. Patricia used her Oscars speech in 2015 to call for wage equality. Way back in 2002, Rosanna made a documentary, Searching for Debra Winger, about the shortage of film roles for older women. \u201cThis is in our DNA,\u201d she says. I suspect even those words are part of the genetic makeup, because Patricia says exactly the same. Arquette tries not to dwell on the kind of career she might have had. \u201cThis is my karma. It\u2019s for the greater good that it happened to me, because what has become more important in my life is the activism, and being a voice for the voiceless. One of the voices for the voiceless,\u201d she amends. She is scrupulously modest. \u201cThe next step is the healing,\u201d she says. To this end, she is \u201cconstantly\u201d working on her trauma in therapy, and \u201ctalking with other women all the time, every day\u201d about their experiences. Don\u2019t these conversations require her to dwell in the moment of abuse? \u201cIt\u2019s not dwelling,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still really new. And we have to be diligent and on top of it at all times, because I think men think this is a phase women are going through, and we\u2019re here to tell you, this is never going away. So many women have been abused, and it\u2019s been normalised. We can\u2019t normalise this. It\u2019s not normal!\u201d Still, I worry about the healing part. Arquette seems to feel all allegations of abuse personally. The day after the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, she woke up with shingles. \u201cBecause the stress was so \u2026 It was just too much when he got off!\u201d And she finds it meaningful that Jeffrey Epstein died on her 60th birthday, as if their fates were entwined. Certainly, she spent her \u201cwhole birthday dealing with a lot of women who were really affected by the fact that Jeffrey Epstein died\u201d. Thankfully, she had \u201ca total rock\u2019n\u2019roll love festival\u201d in her backyard later, attended by activists including Bamby Salcedo, Doctor Astrid Heger, Monica Ramirez and Joni Mitchell. Ellen Barkin was there \u201cin all her glory\u201d. Patricia couldn\u2019t make it \u2013 she was getting over the flu. But Arquette\u2019s daughter Zo\u00eb gave a \u201cbeautiful speech about how she appreciated me and I was always there for her,\u201d Arquette says. And Susanna Hoff from the Bangles played Eternal Flame and Walk Like An Egyptian and Take Me With U by Prince. Arquette is singing it now, quietly: \u201cI don\u2019t care pretty baby, take me with you \u2026\u201d Still, the healing process can\u2019t have been helped by her recent tweet that she was \u201csorry\u201d she \u201cwas born white and privileged\u201d. Afterwards, she received so much abuse on social media that she contacted \u201ca really important person who does risk assessments on these sorts of threats\u201d. He wants her \u201cto be very careful about how I say things\u201d, she says, before launching into a clarification. \u201cI\u2019m defending what I said, and if it pisses people off \u2026 Yes, just by the nature of the colour of my skin, I was born with privilege. And it is unfair. And that\u2019s what I meant to say ... Why is it that I was born with privileges just because of the colour of my skin?\u201d She is fighting on so many fronts. She flits from Weinstein to Epstein to Charles Manson to Kavanaugh, mostly in exclamatory bolts. Bearing in mind the threat specialist\u2019s advice, I wonder if she ever considers ... \u201cDo I ever feel like I should shut the fuck up?\u201d she jumps in. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to not speak out. I think as a human being, it\u2019s my job.\u201d Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein is on Sunday 1 September at 9pm on BBC Two. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 August 2019 to correct Untouchable\u2019s screening details.",

      "body": "<p>Has there been a rise in rightwing comedy? Or just more acts pinning their colours to that mast? A common claim \u2013 flogged to death by the conservative commentariat \u2013 is that comedy is dominated by a \u201cliberal elite\u201d. That was always a tenuous premise: beyond the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/01/jeremy-hardy-obituary\">Jeremy Hardy</a>, the Marks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-steel\">Steel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/markthomas\">Thomas</a>, and mid-career <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/09/josie-long-review-tender-new-baby-mother-stand-edinburgh\">Josie Long</a>, where are all these socialist clowns we keep hearing about? But it\u2019s looking even more ragged now. Since journeyman standup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/15/tory-comedian-geoff-norcott-brexit-conservative\">Geoff Norcott</a> had the bright idea of relaunching himself as a Tory and became a fixture on Question Time, other acts have followed suit. Anti-woke is the fringe pose <em>du jour</em>, not infrequently struck by comics out and proud about their rightwing affiliations.</p> <p>They draw their charge \u2013 such as it is \u2013 from the conceit that they\u2019re fearlessly flouting tyrannical orthodoxy. But the idea that it\u2019s Transgressive \u2013 the title of Scottish comic Leo Kearse\u2019s show \u2013 to PC-bash in public is a bit of a stretch. Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr: comedy arenas are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/03/dave-chappelle-ricky-gervais-standup-comedy-transgender\">full of this stuff</a>. You can\u2019t open the papers or turn on TV without hearing anti-woke and pro-Brexit sentiment. If \u2013 as these comics insist \u2013 free speech is under attack, it\u2019s a pretty feeble attack. Although it did succeed in having Kearse\u2019s previous show, Right-Wing Comedian, cancelled in Australia last year after <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/11/19/41730/i_dont_understand_how_it_could_be_interpreted_as_transphobic\">protests about its alleged transphobia</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03211930c04ee0b9fc792ba630341ad0af71e5f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03211930c04ee0b9fc792ba630341ad0af71e5f9/0_103_2362_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Konstantin Kisin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Right-on \u2026 Konstantin Kisin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Ullathorne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why \u201cwe\u2019re afraid of saying the wrong thing these days\u201d, as Konstantin Kisin puts it. Kisin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/dec/11/comedians-asked-to-sign-behavioural-agreement-for-soas-gig\">made the headlines last year</a> by refusing to perform at a London university after being asked to sign a \u201cbehavioural agreement\u201d relating to the content of his act. (He doesn\u2019t mention that the organiser swiftly apologised.) He raises some legitimate questions in a show exploring why 3,300 people were arrested in the UK last year for things they said on social media.</p> <p>He also contradicts himself. We mustn\u2019t call people we disagree with Nazis, he says \u2013 then ends with a George Carlin quote equating political correctness with fascism. The politics of Dominic Frisby\u2019s show Libertarian Love Songs (Frisby is standing as a p<a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/news/5440/dominic_frisby_mp/\">rexit Party candidate for parliament</a>) are likewise all over the place. Ukulele in hand, he sings that \u201call taxation is theft\u201d, then criticises Amazon for not paying its taxes. He criticises the ubiquitous blandness of modern Britain, then croons a hymn to Wetherspoons.</p> <p>But the show has its charms. Frisby emerges more as contrarian English eccentric than reactionary. His rant about \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d, and the sweet ending to his song about hate speech, both suggest common ground between Frisby\u2019s anti-corporate shtick and the politics of the bolshiest social justice warrior of rightwing demonology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3771a3091160229b5d7b261db0a8cb889e5c5f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3771a3091160229b5d7b261db0a8cb889e5c5f6f/386_842_2123_2652/801.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Marshall as Titania McGrath\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice Marshall as Titania McGrath.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Windmill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Time was, of course, progressive fringe audiences might have rejected even a whiff of Toryism in their comedy. Only five years ago, <a href=\"mailto:https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/jim-davidson-standup-edinburgh-festival-2014-review\">Jim Davidson felt like an outlier here</a> \u2013 although he played in a major venue and was widely reviewed. But we\u2019re all more mindful of diversity and inclusion these days \u2013 and rightist comics are cashing in on the affirmative action. Kisin, Kearse and Frisby\u2019s shows were well attended on my visits, and fair enough: they can be entertaining, and put forward the occasional intelligent point of view. Not so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/05/titania-mcgrath-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Titania McGrath</a>, the fictional Twitter avatar of comedian Andrew Doyle \u2013 now incarnated at the fringe by comic Alice Marshall. Fitfully amusing online, McGrath is a crude caricature on stage, a mean-spirited and largely witless burlesque of millennial wokeness.</p> <p>The show\u2019s presiding idea is that the left is building a gulag out of PC terminology and ever-changing gender pronouns. Spoiler alert: that isn\u2019t true. But there are pertinent conversations to have \u2013 and jokes to make \u2013 about where we draw the lines around offensive and illegal, between acceptable jokes and hateful acts. Kisin wonders how the defence of free speech became \u201ca far-right dog whistle\u201d, and it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s traditionally a progressive cause, and some of the best comedy in Edinburgh on wokeness and new sensitivities around language are from leftwing comics \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/06/ahir-shah-dots-review-monkey-barrel-comedy-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Ahir Shah</a>, say, with his routine on the phrase \u201cpeople of colour\u201d (\u201cas if I\u2019m indistinguishable from a black woman\u201d).</p> <p>If there\u2019s debate around whether woke-bashing is an exclusively rightwing pursuit, there\u2019s none around the Tory credentials of Sarah Southern\u2019s show on the Free Fringe. Southern was the Conservative aide who resigned in 2012 after the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/25/cash-for-access-sarah-southern\">\u201ccash for access\u201d scandal</a>. Now she\u2019s doing standup about her love of Mrs Thatcher, her time in David Cameron\u2019s employ and her fall from grace. The promised interrogation of where she now stands politically never quite materialises, beyond a lame disavowal of the actual record of the government she helped precipitate. (\u201cSome of their policies don\u2019t sit well with me\u201d)</p> <p>But if hers is a low-wattage show, it\u2019s not objectionable. Nor does it \u2013 or any of the shows mentioned \u2013 herald a new rightward direction for standup. There may be those who consider rightwing comedy oxymoronic because comedy mustn\u2019t punch down, and punching down is what rightwingery is all about. But there have always been comics who do that, or who trade in chauvinist stereotypes, or promote individualist values. (As Leo Kearse points out: standup is the ne plus ultra Thatcherite industry.)

      "bodyText": "Has there been a rise in rightwing comedy? Or just more acts pinning their colours to that mast? A common claim \u2013 flogged to death by the conservative commentariat \u2013 is that comedy is dominated by a \u201cliberal elite\u201d. That was always a tenuous premise: beyond the late Jeremy Hardy, the Marks Steel and Thomas, and mid-career Josie Long, where are all these socialist clowns we keep hearing about? But it\u2019s looking even more ragged now. Since journeyman standup Geoff Norcott had the bright idea of relaunching himself as a Tory and became a fixture on Question Time, other acts have followed suit. Anti-woke is the fringe pose du jour, not infrequently struck by comics out and proud about their rightwing affiliations. They draw their charge \u2013 such as it is \u2013 from the conceit that they\u2019re fearlessly flouting tyrannical orthodoxy. But the idea that it\u2019s Transgressive \u2013 the title of Scottish comic Leo Kearse\u2019s show \u2013 to PC-bash in public is a bit of a stretch. Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr: comedy arenas are full of this stuff. You can\u2019t open the papers or turn on TV without hearing anti-woke and pro-Brexit sentiment. If \u2013 as these comics insist \u2013 free speech is under attack, it\u2019s a pretty feeble attack. Although it did succeed in having Kearse\u2019s previous show, Right-Wing Comedian, cancelled in Australia last year after protests about its alleged transphobia. Perhaps that\u2019s why \u201cwe\u2019re afraid of saying the wrong thing these days\u201d, as Konstantin Kisin puts it. Kisin made the headlines last year by refusing to perform at a London university after being asked to sign a \u201cbehavioural agreement\u201d relating to the content of his act. (He doesn\u2019t mention that the organiser swiftly apologised.) He raises some legitimate questions in a show exploring why 3,300 people were arrested in the UK last year for things they said on social media. He also contradicts himself. We mustn\u2019t call people we disagree with Nazis, he says \u2013 then ends with a George Carlin quote equating political correctness with fascism. The politics of Dominic Frisby\u2019s show Libertarian Love Songs (Frisby is standing as a prexit Party candidate for parliament) are likewise all over the place. Ukulele in hand, he sings that \u201call taxation is theft\u201d, then criticises Amazon for not paying its taxes. He criticises the ubiquitous blandness of modern Britain, then croons a hymn to Wetherspoons. But the show has its charms. Frisby emerges more as contrarian English eccentric than reactionary. His rant about \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d, and the sweet ending to his song about hate speech, both suggest common ground between Frisby\u2019s anti-corporate shtick and the politics of the bolshiest social justice warrior of rightwing demonology. Time was, of course, progressive fringe audiences might have rejected even a whiff of Toryism in their comedy. Only five years ago, Jim Davidson felt like an outlier here \u2013 although he played in a major venue and was widely reviewed. But we\u2019re all more mindful of diversity and inclusion these days \u2013 and rightist comics are cashing in on the affirmative action. Kisin, Kearse and Frisby\u2019s shows were well attended on my visits, and fair enough: they can be entertaining, and put forward the occasional intelligent point of view. Not so Titania McGrath, the fictional Twitter avatar of comedian Andrew Doyle \u2013 now incarnated at the fringe by comic Alice Marshall. Fitfully amusing online, McGrath is a crude caricature on stage, a mean-spirited and largely witless burlesque of millennial wokeness. The show\u2019s presiding idea is that the left is building a gulag out of PC terminology and ever-changing gender pronouns. Spoiler alert: that isn\u2019t true. But there are pertinent conversations to have \u2013 and jokes to make \u2013 about where we draw the lines around offensive and illegal, between acceptable jokes and hateful acts. Kisin wonders how the defence of free speech became \u201ca far-right dog whistle\u201d, and it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s traditionally a progressive cause, and some of the best comedy in Edinburgh on wokeness and new sensitivities around language are from leftwing comics \u2013 like Ahir Shah, say, with his routine on the phrase \u201cpeople of colour\u201d (\u201cas if I\u2019m indistinguishable from a black woman\u201d). If there\u2019s debate around whether woke-bashing is an exclusively rightwing pursuit, there\u2019s none around the Tory credentials of Sarah Southern\u2019s show on the Free Fringe. Southern was the Conservative aide who resigned in 2012 after the so-called \u201ccash for access\u201d scandal. Now she\u2019s doing standup about her love of Mrs Thatcher, her time in David Cameron\u2019s employ and her fall from grace. The promised interrogation of where she now stands politically never quite materialises, beyond a lame disavowal of the actual record of the government she helped precipitate. (\u201cSome of their policies don\u2019t sit well with me\u201d) But if hers is a low-wattage show, it\u2019s not objectionable. Nor does it \u2013 or any of the shows mentioned \u2013 herald a new rightward direction for standup. There may be those who consider rightwing comedy oxymoronic because comedy mustn\u2019t punch down, and punching down is what rightwingery is all about. But there have always been comics who do that, or who trade in chauvinist stereotypes, or promote individualist values. (As Leo Kearse points out: standup is the ne plus ultra Thatcherite industry.) Kearse, Frisby and co are just the latest in their line. All that\u2019s changed \u2013 after Norcott banished the stigma, and advertised the career benefits, of calling oneself rightwing \u2013 is the branding.",

      "body": "<p>The Basilica at Arantzazu in the Basque country was a collaboration between the sculptor <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/jorge-oteiza\">Jorge Oteiza</a>, who had just returned to Spain after 15 years in self-imposed exile, and the architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/aug/05/guardianobituaries1\">Francisco Javier S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/aug/05/guardianobituaries1\">\u00e1enz de Oiza</a> (who would become celebrated for his Torres Blancos building in Madrid). Though they won the competition for the building in 1949, it was not consecrated until 1959, after a disputatious decade of ecclesiastical factionalism and local objections. The latter were preposterous given the building\u2019s remoteness at the end of a vertiginous mountain road.</p> <p>The Basilica is the earliest of several Spanish churches whose novel dispositions of space anticipated and influenced the liturgical changes that would be stipulated by the second Vatican council in 1962. The exterior is tough, fortified, uncompromising. Its break from the conventions of sacred design was a papal snub to Franco, a reminder that his power was merely temporal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/where-begin-luis-bunuel\">Luis Bu\u00f1uel</a> was the greatest Spanish artist of the 20th century. He believed that Picasso\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/oct/12/picasso-guernica-aleppo-syria\">Guernica</a> was a meretricious work that should be burned and that mortadella was made by the blind. St James, whom Franco would restore to the position of patron of Spain from which he had been ignominiously removed by the Republic, encountered the Virgin while praying on the banks of the Ebro at Caesaraugusta, later Zaragoza. She was held aloft on a jasper pillar born by angels, hence the name of Zaragoza\u2019s basilica, El Pilar.</p> <p>She set a precedent for attention-craving ascetics such as St Simeon Stylites, who lived for 37 years on top of a pillar near Aleppo and was the subject of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/1077-simon-of-the-desert\">Simon of the Desert</a>. Bu\u00f1uel was the most devout, most observant, most gleefully blasphemous of atheists. After more than 20 years in exile, during which he became a Mexican citizen, he returned to Spain to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/apr/01/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm\">Viridiana</a>: all necrophilia, incest and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fernando-Rey\">Fernando Rey</a>. Because no one was looking and Bu\u00f1uel was cunning, it was chosen as Spain\u2019s entry at the 1961 Cannes film festival. Given the Franquist state\u2019s zealous censorship of writers and film-makers, this was an extraordinary lapse. It won the Palme d\u2019Or. All hell broke loose. It was denounced by the Vatican. Its production companies were closed down. Bu\u00f1uel once again became persona non grata. Viridiana would not be shown in Spain until 1979, four years after the death of Franco \u2013 but not of Franquismo. Over 40 years on it\u2019s still loitering, a grubby menacing sideshow.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks_zMxtqVT8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ks_zMxtqVT8?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Equally extraordinary was the state\u2019s habitual tolerance of nearly all forms of art and architecture. Like many dictators Franco considered himself an artist. He brought shame to Sunday painters. He dismissed as derisory the abstraction that was pervasive from the late 40s till the mid 60s. He rightly considered it politically and socially impotent. It wasn\u2019t Goya, it wasn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/may/14/art-apocalypse-otto-dix-first-world-war-der-krieg-in-pictures\">Otto Dix</a>. It was harmless, self-referential pattern-making that, while it might provoke strong feelings about aesthetic legitimacy, was not going to fire up insurrection. And the various strains of architecture that asserted themselves over an even longer period were, like all architecture down the ages, near mute. Architecture is <em>not</em> a language. It does no more than grunt generalisations: \u201clooking forward\u201d or \u201csummoning the past\u201d or \u201caiming for the heavens\u201d.</p> <p>Franco was described by Churchill as \u201ca gallant Christian gentleman\u201d. HG Wells corrected him: \u201ca<em> murderous </em>Christian gentleman\u201d. From an early age the future murderer unquestioningly accepted the Christian dogma he was force-fed at school in the Galician port of Ferrol \u2013 which was also an arsenal and a garrison. He accepted too a garrison\u2019s hierarchy as the natural order: martial discipline, martial asceticism and martial mores. Add to those an oppressive, omnipresent religious credulousness that infected all aspects of life. Franco believed his destiny was to become the equal of the omnipotent imperial Hapsburg King Philip II. He also sought somehow to reincarnate the medieval military hero <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/El-Cid-Castilian-military-leader\">El Cid</a>. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/apr/26/el-cid-spanish-anthony-mann\">the dreary film with gun-crazy Charlton Heston in the title role</a> was shot near Valencia, Franco loaned the production several thousand soldiers as extras \u2013 which no doubt helped with his metempsychotic ambition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2bec15915b4ce8985b693d2bf5b8b9f4c898d698\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bec15915b4ce8985b693d2bf5b8b9f4c898d698/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Papal snub \u2026 the Basicilia at Arantzazu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Papal snub \u2026 the Basicilia at Arantzazu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ainara Garcia/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two buildings were deemed to be the pinnacle of Spanish architectural achievement. The <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/the-history-of-el-escorial-in-1-minute/\">Escorial</a> was holy as well as regal. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Juan-de-Herrera\">Juan de Herrera</a> was commanded by Philip II to make a building that expressed nobility without arrogance, majesty without ostentation \u2013 rather like Polonius telling Laertes how to dress. Herrera was also responsible for the <a href=\"http://en.www.turismocastillalamancha.es/patrimonio/museo-del-ejercito-alcazar-de-toledo-2661/descripcion/\">Alc</a><a href=\"http://en.www.turismocastillalamancha.es/patrimonio/museo-del-ejercito-alcazar-de-toledo-2661/descripcion/\">\u00e1zar of Toledo</a>. Their obsessive and repetitive sobriety is, weirdly, as dizzying as the overwrought freneticism of the baroque or <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Churrigueresque\">churrigueresque</a>. And, just as weirdly, their chilly rigour feels protestant. They provided the model for Franco\u2019s essays in \u201cstate architecture\u201d, among them:</p> <ul> <li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/spain/madrid/fallen/fallen.html\">Valle de los C</a><a href=\"https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/spain/madrid/fallen/fallen.html\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/spain/madrid/fallen/fallen.html\">\u00eddos</a> (Valley of the Fallen), the monumental act of hypocrisy in stone where he is buried. This was the biggest slave labour project in Europe since the second world war. The slaves were captured republicans, political prisoners, housed in a concentration camp and worked to death with the assurance that \u201c<em>el trabajo enoblece</em>\u201d. Whose German translation is \u201c<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeit_macht_frei\">arbeit macht frei</a></em>\u201d.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.paseosmadrid.com/en/la-moncloa-air-force-headquarters-spain/\">air ministry in Madrid</a>. The disjunction of style and purpose again suggests architectural insentience, as though planes belonged to the 16th century.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>The <a href=\"http://www.laboralciudaddelacultura.com/en/1/ciudad-de-la-cultura/2/historia.html\">University of Gij</a><a href=\"http://www.laboralciudaddelacultura.com/en/1/ciudad-de-la-cultura/2/historia.html\">\u00f3n by Luis Moya</a> is the largest building in Spain. It was originally intended as an orphanage but soon became a technical school too. Franco created orphans by the thousand. Like <a href=\"https://www.pantagruelista.com/blogeng/cronus-myth\">Goya\u2019s Chronos</a>, he ate them by the score.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>He built orphanages; more like madrassas really. Indoctrination with lashings \u2013 take that how you will \u2013 of orthodoxy and obscurantism. The children of murdered republicans would be brainwashed with mariology and hagiology. Their heretical names would be changed from the revolutionary names their dead parents had given them: Passionaria, Luxemburg, Prairial, Germinal, Danton, St Just. Their teachers were brides and bridegrooms of Christ, the rank and paedophile of the Catholic church who enjoyed job satisfaction.</p></li> </ul> <p>Though Gij\u00f3n is in the Asturias, the building\u2019s distended classicism has nothing to do with the architecture of that province. It is rather an emblem of Franco\u2019s moral reconquest, his sacralisation of everyday life, his castillianisation of everyday life, his unification. Provinces that didn\u2019t fall into line were likely to suffer aerial diplomacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abf667e3fda3c05712e3f511ee53be9bfe4e700f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abf667e3fda3c05712e3f511ee53be9bfe4e700f/0_28_850_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Moya\u2019s Gij\u00f3n University building.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moya\u2019s Gij\u00f3n University building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This phase of official architecture didn\u2019t last. The civil war and Franco\u2019s collaboration seemed to get lost in a fog of international amnesia. This amnesia was encouraged by America\u2019s strategic friendship of convenience: financial assistance in return for land on which to build airbases. Ideology could be suspended in exchange for white goods, jukeboxes, two-tone cars.</p> <p>The government was increasingly influenced by the lay Catholic organisation Opus Dei and its so-called technocrats, judicious pragmatists determined to open Spain to the world beyond the Pyrenees known as the continent. The architectural work of the Opus Dei member <a href=\"https://pinupmagazine.org/articles/the-peculiar-architecture-of-miguel-fisac\">Miguel Fisac</a> was part of that process. Spain was trying to achieve what would be internationally recognised as a sort of normality: fascism was, by the mid 1950s, a freakish outlier from a past that was to be ignominiously buried, along with its victims. The appetite for recrimination was frail.</p> <p>One of the few things buildings can articulate is newness, a prospect of a progressive future. <a href=\"http://www.mascontext.com/issues/25-26-legacy-spring-summer-15/the-short-life-and-long-history-of-the-pagoda/\">Fisac\u2019s quite wonderful Pagoda</a>, which anyone arriving at Madrid airport and driving into the city could not help but see, was an unequivocal message that Spain had caught up at last, it was modern. And the modern state vandalises. This great building was demolished three decades after it was built.</p> <p>Infrastructure tends to endure more. Land colonies in the form of new villages were built in the 1950s and 60s under the direction of the agromomist Rafael Cavestany. The government feared a recurrence of the second republic\u2019s food shortages and consequent public disorder unless something was done to tackle the inequity of land ownership. Agrarian reform would not only bring improved crops and improved livestock, it would transform still feudal peasants into sort of proper smallholders. The chaos of land ownership would be resolved. And the rural diaspora would be reversed. The villages invite correspondences with Nazi settlement programmes but the latter were more trumpeted than delivered, and where they were achieved they were folksy, wilful expressions of blood and soil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a73b94bab2e1d3f13ad32cc69c70175cc61942f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a73b94bab2e1d3f13ad32cc69c70175cc61942f/0_53_5197_3119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza\u2019s Torres Blancas building in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza\u2019s Torres Blancas building in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Thomas Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thirty thousand houses were built in settlements of diverse sizes, many in areas that had till lately been arid. Franco boasted that his greatest legacy to the country he had otherwise despoiled was his irrigation of it. He built more than 500 dams. He liked to preside at their openings, quite ignoring how ecologically disastrous many of them were.</p> <p>His self-esteem swelled, a goitre of patriotic pride. Changing the climate \u2013 whether by cloud seeding or diverting rivers \u2013 is the mark of a human god, an aquarian magician who was described as a statesman unique in the world, laying the hydraulic foundations for the wellbeing and progress of his people.</p> <p>Bad geography meant too much rain in the north, too little in the south. Surfeit and deficit: with deficit came drought. The most grandiose of the schemes to overcome the natural imbalance was the <a href=\"http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=c,373,m,1915&amp;r=ReP-27528-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE\">Tajo Segura Transfer</a>.</p> <p>Water is pumped to a height of 300 metres above the dammed Tajo in the mountains east of Madrid. Canalised, it flows 300km through a system of reservoirs, dams, tunnels, pumping stations and aqueducts to Murcia, the region of Spain most frequently afflicted by drought and the one that supplied Franco\u2019s Nationalists with its most murderous butchers.</p> <p>It is anyway a great feat of hydraulic engineering. Whose beneficiaries were the <em>latifundistas</em>, the landowners who had backed Franco. And whose favourite sport was jocularly called agrarian reform. It consisted of hunting on horseback with packs of dogs. The quarry comprised destitute peasants, rural reds, bucolic bolshies.</p> <p>They were people who didn\u2019t have a ladder to be at the bottom of \u2013 and whose body would be dumped in the usual pit. The other losers were the thousands of inhabitants of villages drowned because they stood in the way of reservoirs. Many of the interventions were also ecologically disastrous: in the age-old battle between environment and profit \u2013 here posing as the common good and agrarian reform \u2013 it was profit that won. The bottom line is the most potent of ideals.</p> <p>In 1948 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/02/spain-camino-santiago-compostela-pilgrimage\">Santiago de Compostela</a> attracted half a million pilgrims \u2026 or tourists. They enjoyed such pious diversions as fireworks, football tournaments and bullfights, even though the last were not, and are still not, locally popular. It was \u2013 still is \u2013 the least <em>Espa</em><em>\u00f1olada</em> province of Spain, that is the least afflicted by castanets, bells, bulls and balls and all the Hemingway/<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/dec/06/londonreviewofbooks\">Tynan</a> nobility-of-machismo schtick.</p> <p>But the jamboree was not merely a question of devotion to St James, or of penitence, of absolution, of self-denial. It was an earner. Here was an opportunity for the pariah state, denied foreign aid, to get its fascist gauntlets on some democratic coin: sovs, krone, francs. The germ of an idea was planted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba8e147d13a136eec1cd13d694de92ecb91ab71d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba8e147d13a136eec1cd13d694de92ecb91ab71d/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Money over morality \u2026 Levante Beach, Benidorm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Money over morality \u2026 Levante Beach, Benidorm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/02/spain\">Pedro Zaragoza</a> was an energetic Franquist placeman born in the small, economically straitened fishing port between Valencia and Alicante. He was sent back there from Madrid to be its mayor at the age of 28.</p> <p>Zaragoza would become one of the most effective urbanists in the world. Not least because he had probably never heard of the pseudoscience of urbanism, had never shown interest in theories that fell off the back of a lorry loaded with dogmatic pretention. He turned an off-the-map village into an enterprise that changed a nation. When he took up his post in 1950, Benidorm had four hotels \u2013 hostels really \u2013 which provided fewer than 100 beds.</p> <p>\u201cRender unto Caesar the things which be Caesar\u2019s and unto God the things which be God\u2019s.\u201d Together with Jesus\u2019s retort to Pilate that \u201cmy kingdom is not of this world\u201d, this may be read as a way of emphasising that the temporal state and the sacred church are separate. So while God-botherers may have indignantly objected to displays of flesh, to displays of public drunkenness, to displays of mob loutishness by Ingerlandlandland\u2019s finest, their opinion counted for little. Impious money will always take precedence over prim morality. Throwing the merchants out of the temple was the work of a prig.</p> <p>Police were instructed to turn a blind eye, which, given what they would be having to look at, was probably what they wanted anyway \u2013 though when they did intervene it was with batons, firearms, chains and daft hats. That\u2019s just good old-fashioned coppering, Spanish style.</p> <p>Franco hugely approved of the place. Forget the provenance. It\u2019s no more wicked than a Volkswagen car.

      "bodyText": "The Basilica at Arantzazu in the Basque country was a collaboration between the sculptor Jorge Oteiza, who had just returned to Spain after 15 years in self-imposed exile, and the architect Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza (who would become celebrated for his Torres Blancos building in Madrid). Though they won the competition for the building in 1949, it was not consecrated until 1959, after a disputatious decade of ecclesiastical factionalism and local objections. The latter were preposterous given the building\u2019s remoteness at the end of a vertiginous mountain road. The Basilica is the earliest of several Spanish churches whose novel dispositions of space anticipated and influenced the liturgical changes that would be stipulated by the second Vatican council in 1962. The exterior is tough, fortified, uncompromising. Its break from the conventions of sacred design was a papal snub to Franco, a reminder that his power was merely temporal. Luis Bu\u00f1uel was the greatest Spanish artist of the 20th century. He believed that Picasso\u2019s Guernica was a meretricious work that should be burned and that mortadella was made by the blind. St James, whom Franco would restore to the position of patron of Spain from which he had been ignominiously removed by the Republic, encountered the Virgin while praying on the banks of the Ebro at Caesaraugusta, later Zaragoza. She was held aloft on a jasper pillar born by angels, hence the name of Zaragoza\u2019s basilica, El Pilar. She set a precedent for attention-craving ascetics such as St Simeon Stylites, who lived for 37 years on top of a pillar near Aleppo and was the subject of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s Simon of the Desert. Bu\u00f1uel was the most devout, most observant, most gleefully blasphemous of atheists. After more than 20 years in exile, during which he became a Mexican citizen, he returned to Spain to make Viridiana: all necrophilia, incest and Fernando Rey. Because no one was looking and Bu\u00f1uel was cunning, it was chosen as Spain\u2019s entry at the 1961 Cannes film festival. Given the Franquist state\u2019s zealous censorship of writers and film-makers, this was an extraordinary lapse. It won the Palme d\u2019Or. All hell broke loose. It was denounced by the Vatican. Its production companies were closed down. Bu\u00f1uel once again became persona non grata. Viridiana would not be shown in Spain until 1979, four years after the death of Franco \u2013 but not of Franquismo. Over 40 years on it\u2019s still loitering, a grubby menacing sideshow. Equally extraordinary was the state\u2019s habitual tolerance of nearly all forms of art and architecture. Like many dictators Franco considered himself an artist. He brought shame to Sunday painters. He dismissed as derisory the abstraction that was pervasive from the late 40s till the mid 60s. He rightly considered it politically and socially impotent. It wasn\u2019t Goya, it wasn\u2019t Otto Dix. It was harmless, self-referential pattern-making that, while it might provoke strong feelings about aesthetic legitimacy, was not going to fire up insurrection. And the various strains of architecture that asserted themselves over an even longer period were, like all architecture down the ages, near mute. Architecture is not a language. It does no more than grunt generalisations: \u201clooking forward\u201d or \u201csummoning the past\u201d or \u201caiming for the heavens\u201d. Franco was described by Churchill as \u201ca gallant Christian gentleman\u201d. HG Wells corrected him: \u201ca murderous Christian gentleman\u201d. From an early age the future murderer unquestioningly accepted the Christian dogma he was force-fed at school in the Galician port of Ferrol \u2013 which was also an arsenal and a garrison. He accepted too a garrison\u2019s hierarchy as the natural order: martial discipline, martial asceticism and martial mores. Add to those an oppressive, omnipresent religious credulousness that infected all aspects of life. Franco believed his destiny was to become the equal of the omnipotent imperial Hapsburg King Philip II. He also sought somehow to reincarnate the medieval military hero El Cid. When the dreary film with gun-crazy Charlton Heston in the title role was shot near Valencia, Franco loaned the production several thousand soldiers as extras \u2013 which no doubt helped with his metempsychotic ambition. Two buildings were deemed to be the pinnacle of Spanish architectural achievement. The Escorial was holy as well as regal. Juan de Herrera was commanded by Philip II to make a building that expressed nobility without arrogance, majesty without ostentation \u2013 rather like Polonius telling Laertes how to dress. Herrera was also responsible for the Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo. Their obsessive and repetitive sobriety is, weirdly, as dizzying as the overwrought freneticism of the baroque or churrigueresque. And, just as weirdly, their chilly rigour feels protestant. They provided the model for Franco\u2019s essays in \u201cstate architecture\u201d, among them: The Valle de los Ca\u00eddos (Valley of the Fallen), the monumental act of hypocrisy in stone where he is buried. This was the biggest slave labour project in Europe since the second world war. The slaves were captured republicans, political prisoners, housed in a concentration camp and worked to death with the assurance that \u201cel trabajo enoblece\u201d. Whose German translation is \u201carbeit macht frei\u201d. The air ministry in Madrid. The disjunction of style and purpose again suggests architectural insentience, as though planes belonged to the 16th century. The University of Gij\u00f3n by Luis Moya is the largest building in Spain. It was originally intended as an orphanage but soon became a technical school too. Franco created orphans by the thousand. Like Goya\u2019s Chronos, he ate them by the score. He built orphanages; more like madrassas really. Indoctrination with lashings \u2013 take that how you will \u2013 of orthodoxy and obscurantism. The children of murdered republicans would be brainwashed with mariology and hagiology. Their heretical names would be changed from the revolutionary names their dead parents had given them: Passionaria, Luxemburg, Prairial, Germinal, Danton, St Just. Their teachers were brides and bridegrooms of Christ, the rank and paedophile of the Catholic church who enjoyed job satisfaction. Though Gij\u00f3n is in the Asturias, the building\u2019s distended classicism has nothing to do with the architecture of that province. It is rather an emblem of Franco\u2019s moral reconquest, his sacralisation of everyday life, his castillianisation of everyday life, his unification. Provinces that didn\u2019t fall into line were likely to suffer aerial diplomacy. This phase of official architecture didn\u2019t last. The civil war and Franco\u2019s collaboration seemed to get lost in a fog of international amnesia. This amnesia was encouraged by America\u2019s strategic friendship of convenience: financial assistance in return for land on which to build airbases. Ideology could be suspended in exchange for white goods, jukeboxes, two-tone cars. The government was increasingly influenced by the lay Catholic organisation Opus Dei and its so-called technocrats, judicious pragmatists determined to open Spain to the world beyond the Pyrenees known as the continent. The architectural work of the Opus Dei member Miguel Fisac was part of that process. Spain was trying to achieve what would be internationally recognised as a sort of normality: fascism was, by the mid 1950s, a freakish outlier from a past that was to be ignominiously buried, along with its victims. The appetite for recrimination was frail. One of the few things buildings can articulate is newness, a prospect of a progressive future. Fisac\u2019s quite wonderful Pagoda, which anyone arriving at Madrid airport and driving into the city could not help but see, was an unequivocal message that Spain had caught up at last, it was modern. And the modern state vandalises. This great building was demolished three decades after it was built. Infrastructure tends to endure more. Land colonies in the form of new villages were built in the 1950s and 60s under the direction of the agromomist Rafael Cavestany. The government feared a recurrence of the second republic\u2019s food shortages and consequent public disorder unless something was done to tackle the inequity of land ownership. Agrarian reform would not only bring improved crops and improved livestock, it would transform still feudal peasants into sort of proper smallholders. The chaos of land ownership would be resolved. And the rural diaspora would be reversed. The villages invite correspondences with Nazi settlement programmes but the latter were more trumpeted than delivered, and where they were achieved they were folksy, wilful expressions of blood and soil. Thirty thousand houses were built in settlements of diverse sizes, many in areas that had till lately been arid. Franco boasted that his greatest legacy to the country he had otherwise despoiled was his irrigation of it. He built more than 500 dams. He liked to preside at their openings, quite ignoring how ecologically disastrous many of them were. His self-esteem swelled, a goitre of patriotic pride. Changing the climate \u2013 whether by cloud seeding or diverting rivers \u2013 is the mark of a human god, an aquarian magician who was described as a statesman unique in the world, laying the hydraulic foundations for the wellbeing and progress of his people. Bad geography meant too much rain in the north, too little in the south. Surfeit and deficit: with deficit came drought. The most grandiose of the schemes to overcome the natural imbalance was the Tajo Segura Transfer. Water is pumped to a height of 300 metres above the dammed Tajo in the mountains east of Madrid. Canalised, it flows 300km through a system of reservoirs, dams, tunnels, pumping stations and aqueducts to Murcia, the region of Spain most frequently afflicted by drought and the one that supplied Franco\u2019s Nationalists with its most murderous butchers. It is anyway a great feat of hydraulic engineering. Whose beneficiaries were the latifundistas, the landowners who had backed Franco. And whose favourite sport was jocularly called agrarian reform. It consisted of hunting on horseback with packs of dogs. The quarry comprised destitute peasants, rural reds, bucolic bolshies. They were people who didn\u2019t have a ladder to be at the bottom of \u2013 and whose body would be dumped in the usual pit. The other losers were the thousands of inhabitants of villages drowned because they stood in the way of reservoirs. Many of the interventions were also ecologically disastrous: in the age-old battle between environment and profit \u2013 here posing as the common good and agrarian reform \u2013 it was profit that won. The bottom line is the most potent of ideals. In 1948 Santiago de Compostela attracted half a million pilgrims \u2026 or tourists. They enjoyed such pious diversions as fireworks, football tournaments and bullfights, even though the last were not, and are still not, locally popular. It was \u2013 still is \u2013 the least Espa\u00f1olada province of Spain, that is the least afflicted by castanets, bells, bulls and balls and all the Hemingway/Tynan nobility-of-machismo schtick. But the jamboree was not merely a question of devotion to St James, or of penitence, of absolution, of self-denial. It was an earner. Here was an opportunity for the pariah state, denied foreign aid, to get its fascist gauntlets on some democratic coin: sovs, krone, francs. The germ of an idea was planted. Pedro Zaragoza was an energetic Franquist placeman born in the small, economically straitened fishing port between Valencia and Alicante. He was sent back there from Madrid to be its mayor at the age of 28. Zaragoza would become one of the most effective urbanists in the world. Not least because he had probably never heard of the pseudoscience of urbanism, had never shown interest in theories that fell off the back of a lorry loaded with dogmatic pretention. He turned an off-the-map village into an enterprise that changed a nation. When he took up his post in 1950, Benidorm had four hotels \u2013 hostels really \u2013 which provided fewer than 100 beds. \u201cRender unto Caesar the things which be Caesar\u2019s and unto God the things which be God\u2019s.\u201d Together with Jesus\u2019s retort to Pilate that \u201cmy kingdom is not of this world\u201d, this may be read as a way of emphasising that the temporal state and the sacred church are separate. So while God-botherers may have indignantly objected to displays of flesh, to displays of public drunkenness, to displays of mob loutishness by Ingerlandlandland\u2019s finest, their opinion counted for little. Impious money will always take precedence over prim morality. Throwing the merchants out of the temple was the work of a prig. Police were instructed to turn a blind eye, which, given what they would be having to look at, was probably what they wanted anyway \u2013 though when they did intervene it was with batons, firearms, chains and daft hats. That\u2019s just good old-fashioned coppering, Spanish style. Franco hugely approved of the place. Forget the provenance. It\u2019s no more wicked than a Volkswagen car. And it\u2019s an architectural marvel where on any given night you can hear one of the 17 bands that claim to be the authentic Rubettes damaging their throats.

      "bodyText": "The nightmares kept coming and David Leal knew he was in trouble. A navy veteran with a can-do attitude and a solidly middle-class IT job at a hospital in Santa Rosa, California, he didn\u2019t think of himself as mentally vulnerable. But when the Tubbs fire snatched his house off the face of the earth in the early morning hours of 9 October 2017, it hit him hard. \u201cLong story short, I went through a lot of PTSD,\u201d Leal says, as we tour his nearly rebuilt home in Santa Rosa\u2019s Coffey Park neighborhood. Wildfires are not uncommon in the mountains outside of this northern California town, but residents can\u2019t remember one like this: the fire jumped six lanes of Highway 101, into the city, and licked up about 1,300 of the suburb\u2019s 2,000 homes as if they had just evaporated. Leal thought, I live in the city; it\u2019s not supposed to burn. \u201cRetiring from the navy, I had a lot of junk in my head,\u201d he adds. After the fire, it all came up. \u201cI was having nightmares of occurrences that I went through in the military \u2013 but it was going even further back. My brain was just unloading. Every traumatic issue I ever had in my life was coming back to me. There were things that I went through as a little boy that I was waking up going, \u2018Whoa. Where did that come from?\u2019\u201d The climate crisis is manifesting as ever bigger wildfires, hurricanes, floods and heat waves, and cities are just starting to grapple with the mental impact of the emergency. A climate taskforce of the American Psychological Association, citing scores of studies over the last decades, reports that survivors of these human-enhanced disasters are experiencing dramatic increases in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, suicide and suicidal thoughts, violent behavior and increased use of drugs and alcohol. A Rand study found that one-third of the adult survivors of California wildfires in 2003 suffered depression and one-quarter suffered PTSD. Those with a history of mental or behavioral issues are particularly at risk. But many others are taken by surprise when they suddenly realize they can\u2019t sleep or work, or can\u2019t shake their sadness. \u201cIt\u2019s a normal human response to a terrible thing,\u201d said Adrienne Heinz, a researcher at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Center for PTSD who lives in Sonoma. The mental health effects of climate change have been known for quite some time now: a 1991 meta-study found that as many as 40% of those directly affected by climate-enhanced superstorms and fires suffer acute negative mental health effects, some of which become chronic. Puerto Rico, for example, has seen an epidemic of suicide, PTSD and depression after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. After Hurricane Katrina, some people referred to the sense of generalized anxiety and depression common to survivors as \u201cKatrina brain\u201d. But it\u2019s not just storms that impact mental health. An extensive 2018 Australian study established that extremes of both hot and cold are linked to suicide and mental illness, and the ensuing drought has contributed to a surge in deaths of Australian farmers. Even those not directly impacted by flood or fire can experience a sense of ecological loss termed \u201ceco-anxiety\u201d or \u201cclimate grief\u201d. Lila Iyer, a doctor of internal medicine who works for the VA, was in her home with her husband, Bala, in Santa Rosa\u2019s high-end Fountaingrove neighborhood when 60mph winds pushing ahead of the Tubbs fire began battering their house. She jumped into one car and he into the other. The cars would be among the few possessions the couple managed to save. The Iyers\u2019 house was reduced to a blackened foundation, the window glass evaporated and metal melted into puddles. Still, within a few days Iyer went back to work. Helping people was her way to cope. Until she herself suddenly needed help. \u201cAfter Thanksgiving, the stress hit me, bodily hit me,\u201d she said. \u201cI could feel the anxiety and all that coming.\u201d Iyer saw a psychologist, who recommended she try out what she called a \u201csoul yoga\u201d session for fire victims. The sessions weren\u2019t your typical workout yoga. The sequences of this \u201ctrauma-informed yoga\u201d were designed to address the way pain and fear embed in the body, and for Iyer, they made a tremendous difference. \u201cThis is like a PTSD,\u201d Iyer said, \u201cand for myself, the yoga was the best form of treatment.\u201d The yoga classes Iyer attended were the first initiative of an innovative program called the Wildfire Mental Health Collaborative. The first-of-its-kind collaborative was established by a not-for-profit in Sonoma county, where Santa Rosa lies, following the fires. It offered residents a set of six tools, including a phone app that allows users to track their affect and behavior, private therapy and trauma-informed yoga \u2013 all at no cost. The Healthcare Foundation of northern Sonoma county jumped in to organize the collaborative because residents who\u2019d escaped the fire soon found themselves confronted by another hurdle: government disaster funding may help rebuild their town, but it doesn\u2019t help them cope with the trauma. In Sonoma, the needs were acute. Outreach workers funded by grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had made contact with about 70,000 of Sonoma county\u2019s half-million residents following the fires, and referred thousands for mental health services. But disaster money doesn\u2019t pay for long-term therapy, it\u2019s meant for crisis contact. California\u2019s Department of Health Care Services nor the local government had a pot of money bubbling for that purpose either. \u201cWe knew as people left shelters that they were shellshocked. People were hurting, just really hurting,\u201d said Debbie Mason, the CEO of the Healthcare Foundation of northern Sonoma county. The collaborative came to life within weeks after the fire, as people who represented mental health professional associations, not-for-profits and clinics in the community asked themselves, \u201cif we were building a fire response for mental health, what would that look like in our community?\u201d Mason recalled. The group resolved to use private funding to provide some longer-term help to those identified by the Fema outreach. The tools they came up with were meant to address residents\u2019 varying needs. Some people just needed to know that their feelings were real and to have someplace to go with them or someone to talk to; others needed long-term psychotherapy. The tools also included Skills for Psychological Recovery training for mental health professionals and first responders. The technique was developed by Heinz\u2019s colleague Joe Ruzek, who formerly worked at the VA, together with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.

      "bodyText": "The ACT government is being urged to introduce Australia\u2019s first ever fixed-site community drug testing facility after the discovery of a number of potentially fatal substances during a pill-testing trial held in Canberra. Pill Testing Australia held its second trial at the Groovin\u2019 the Moo festival in Canberra in April and found seven pills containing the highly toxic chemical N-Ethylpentylone, a drug associated with deaths and mass casualty events in the US and New Zealand. On Sunday the group released the full results of the trial, revealing that while MDMA was the most common substance reported, only 67% of the pills believed to contain the substance were found to be a relatively pure dose. The average age of those using the service was 19, and 160 of the 208 people interviewed by PTA disclosed they had used drugs previously. PTA is one of a number of harm-reduction groups pushing for a wider rollout of pill testing in Australia, and in its report it included 10 recommendations including a call for the ACT government to provide permanent funding for pill testing at future music festivals in the territory. It also called for the introduction of \u201ca pilot fixed site pill testing service\u201d in the ACT, a service available in a number of jurisdictions in Europe allowing drug testing outside of the music festival setting. In 2014, the Drugs Information and Monitoring System \u2013 a community-based drug testing service in the Netherlands \u2013 was credited with saving lives after it released public warnings following the discovery of a number of pills containing the harmful substance PMMA. There were no deaths in the country, however in the UK four people died after consuming the same pill. In a statement, the ACT health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, said it would respond to the recommendations after the release of an independent evaluation of the trial being conducted by the Australian National University expected to be complete by the end of the year. \u201cThe ACT government does not condone the use of illicit drugs, we know the safest option remains not to take drugs and this will always be our advice to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we also believe governments have a responsibility to not only try and prevent drug use but also to support initiatives that reduce the harms associated with drug use. This is why we have provided a supportive policy environment for the trials to take place in the ACT.\u201d Advocates for the widespread rollout of pill testing in Australia argue that it can help reduce the harms associated with illicit drugs, and the PTA report stated that all seven people found to have pills containing N-Ethylpentylone disposed of the drug. PTA also said the service was able to provide health information to consumers. For example, while 27 people who used the service disclosed having a health condition, 10 reported being on antidepressant medications and none of those had received information about the potential risks of combining drugs. \u201cNor had they felt comfortable disclosing their illicit drug use to their doctor,\u201d the report stated. PTA also joined called for pill-testing trials to be rolled out in other states. In New South Wales, the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to introduce the service following a number of pill deaths last summer. However a government-commissioned inquiry into amphetamine-type substances and a coronial inquest into a number of pill deaths are both considering recommending its introduction. In May Guardian Australia revealed the head of the amphetamine inquiry, Dan Howard, attended the pill testing trial in Canberra.",

      "bodyText": "Almost 40 agile wallabies have been found dead, feared poisoned, during the past week in north Queensland, at a site where their habitat has been destroyed and isolated by housing development. On Monday morning wildlife rescue volunteers found another four wallabies dead near sporting fields at Trinity Beach, north of Cairns. The Agile Project, a group that cares for the wallabies and has been fighting a legal case seeking to relocate them, says 37 agile wallabies had died in similar circumstances in the past week. \u201cI woke up this morning and I had no doubt in my mind there would be more dead,\u201d said Shai Ager, an ecologist who started the conservation group two years ago. \u201cOur rescuers are nearly broken. It\u2019s been 37 deaths now in the past few days. They\u2019re dying a horrible death too, I\u2019ve sat with three of them while they\u2019ve been foaming at the mouth.\u201d Autopsy results are not expected for a few days and Ager said local rescuers did not want to rush to conclusions, but that \u201cstrange\u201d symptoms tended to indicate poisoning rather than disease or environmental factors. At the weekend, seven live joeys were found in the pouch of their dead mother. Five have survived and are being cared for by rescuers. For the past two years, wildlife rescuers have been lobbying to have the wallabies relocated from an increasingly isolated environment at Trinity Beach. The animals have effectively been hemmed into a shrinking habitat between the Captain Cook Highway, the Bluewater housing estate and the coastal mangroves, with diminishing food and water supplies. Ager said the large housing development had left only a small amount of bushland for the population of coastal wallabies, pushing many into spaces like backyards, sporting fields and public parks. Some locals consider them pests. \u201cThe development has disregarded the wallabies,\u201d Ager said. \u201cNow there\u2019s just too many in such a small space. They haven\u2019t put practical management plans in place, and they\u2019ve been pushed out of their land and they\u2019re now living in people\u2019s backyards.\u201d During the past two years, local media in Cairns has reported on conflict between humans and wallabies at Trinity Beach. In 2017 a child was reportedly injured by a wallaby. Rescuers are increasingly concerned by the numbers of wallabies in the area being hit by cars or attacked by dogs. Last year, the Agile Project began a court case against the Queensland government seeking permission to relocate the entire local wallaby population. They have identified two suitable properties in the Cairns region and the case is set to return to court in October. \u201cThe government has been ignoring this population of wallabies hoping the situation goes away,\u201d Ager said. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that people would be doing outrageous things like this.

He said she was unable to have a \u201cmeaningful interaction\u201d with him and, in a statement made soon after Day\u2019s death, said: \u201cI thought she was delirious.\u201d Irvine only spoke to Day once, for a few minutes. Asked if he considered calling an ambulance instead, given he said he thought she posed a risk only to her own personal safety, Irvine said no. The lawyer for Day\u2019s family, Peter Morrissey, asked if Irvine considered offering Day a drink of water, or asking if she was OK, before requesting that police be notified. He said no. \u201cIn short, did you offer any help of any sort?\u201d Morrissey asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cLook, I am not sure specifically.\u201d Police took Day into custody after first trying to organise for a family member to collect her and said they intended to hold her for four hours to \u201csober up\u201d. She was supposed to be checked and physically roused every 30 minutes. Instead, a coronial inquest heard, police decided to check her every 20 minutes but only rouse her every 40 minutes. They did not physically enter the holding cell and attempt to rouse the Yorta Yorta woman until 8.03pm, when they were preparing to release her. CCTV footage from the holding cell, which will be played in court, showed Day fell five times between 4.20pm and 6.39pm, including falling forward to hit her forehead on the wall at 4.50pm. It was \u201ca significant impact\u201d, Catherine Fitzgerald, the counsel assisting the coroner said. Medical expert Dr Michael Burke, who watched the footage, said that fall was \u201ca very significant blunt impact which could be expected to form a brain injury and subsequent haemorrhage\u201d. Morrissey, said the failure of police to adequately care for Day when she was in their custody, and the likelihood that racial bias played a role in the decision of both police and V/Line staff to take Day from the train in the first place, were her children\u2019s main concerns. \u201cHow can it be that a woman so much loved, whose difficulties are dwarfed by her good and valuable qualities, who was hurting no one, abusing and hitting no one, importuning no one, could be removed in a manner of minutes from a train on which she was travelling?\u201d Morrissey said. The Andrews government announced ahead of the inquest that it would abolish the crime of public drunkenness. More than 60 people gathered at the Kings Domain for a smoking ceremony ahead of the inquest. Belinda Stevens said the circumstances surrounding her mother\u2019s death \u201c have made the past 18 months extremely difficult for our family and we want to know the truth and we want justice for our mum\u201d. The coroner will rule on Tuesday morning on whether to immediately release all the CCTV footage that will be shown during the course of the inquest, in accordance with the family\u2019s wishes. Lawyers for all other parties apart from Day\u2019s family oppose footage being released before it is played in court. The inquest will hear from almost 30 witnesses and run for three weeks.",

A host for the Australian edition is yet to be confirmed. Australia has already proven a lucrative canvas for Drag Race stars to sew their sequins. In 2014, drag queen and former Celebrity Big Brother winner Courtney Act placed runner-up on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season six, making the performer arguably Australia\u2019s most successful drag export since The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Series alumni, including Bianca Del Rio, Trixie Mattel and Alyssa Edwards, have mounted successful national tours of Australia. Several more Drag Race-affiliated live shows are coming to Australia in February 2020, including the show\u2019s official Werq the World tour. While many Drag Race contestants worked full-time as drag queens prior to being cast, the show is almost singular in its ability to turn drag into a viable career for contestants. For many, this prospect is as tempting as the show\u2019s $100,000 prize money. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 August 2019. Courtney Act won Celebrity Big Brother, not Australian Idol as stated in an earlier version.",

      "body": "<p>Like many others who have drunk the Collingwood Kool-Aid since the AFL powerhouse joined Super Netball in 2017, I have more than once been left looking like a goal keeper gone hunting out of the circle, only to watch the ball sail over their head to the smug, unguarded shooter under the post. Like a patsy, as Liz Ellis would say.</p> <p>Collingwood have repeatedly and spectacularly failed to live up to their own and external hype since bursting onto the elite netball scene in a blaze of publicity. Despite a well-funded program, unrivalled training facilities and a roster of world-class talent, the Pies have made an art form of under-delivering \u2013&#xa0;a netball version of the Colliwobbles.</p> <p>So it is only natural that when the 2019 Pies look like they might produce something special, caution comes to the fore. Or, just maybe, that cup of Kool-Aid looks tempting once again. In beating the Melbourne Vixens by 11 goals in the last home-and-away round on Sunday, the Pies \u2013 who for all money looked out of finals contention a few weeks ago \u2013 snatched fourth spot from the Giants and locked in an improbable finals berth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/14/retiring-caitlyn-nevins-proves-hard-work-pays-dividends-in-netball\">Retiring Caitlyn Nevins proves hard work pays dividends in netball | Erin Delahunty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The win \u2013 led by a rampaging Ash Brazill, who won her third MVP in a row\u2013 was convincing. Against all odds, the Pies are now playing finals and they\u2019re not just making up the numbers. After winning their last three on the trot by an average of eight goals, Collingwood are arguably in the best form of any side in the finals.</p> <p>On Sunday, they will face the Vixens again, but this time in a minor semi-final in Melbourne. The winner advances to a preliminary, against either the Lightning or Swifts on Saturday. Could the Pies once more beat the Vixens, as they have the last three times they\u2019ve met \u2013 twice in the regular season and once at the pre-season #TeamGirls Cup? Or is there one more wobble to come?</p> <p>The seeds of doubt about the Pies\u2019 ability to deliver were sown years ago. Before the start of the 2017 season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/17/super-netball-collingwoods-stars-have-air-of-invincibility-on-paper-at-least\">they were dubbed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/17/super-netball-collingwoods-stars-have-air-of-invincibility-on-paper-at-least\"> netball\u2019s \u201cgal\u00e1cticos\u201d</a>: a band of stars, each so individually talented that collectively, they should have been unbeatable, similar to Real Madrid in the early 2000s. The foundation team, coached by Kristy Keppich-Birrell, was bursting at the seams with then-Diamonds. It featured defensive pair Sharni Layton and April Brandley, midcourt dynamos Kim Ravaillion, Madi Browne and Brazill, and shooter Caitlin Thwaites.</p> <p>With that line-up, the Pies were unbackable favourites for the first Super Netball flag. But they didn\u2019t even come close. They had nine wins that year and just scraped into finals but lost to eventual runners-up, the Giants, in the first week. By the lofty expectations inside and outside the club, season one was an abject failure and left many pundits wishing they had not had taken such a large gulp of said tempting drink when the Lightning lifted the trophy.</p> <p>In season two, Keppich-Birrell added veteran shooter Erin Bell and young defender Matilda Garrett and again, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/27/exciting-scoring-changes-to-spice-up-new-super-netball-season\">most analysts </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/27/exciting-scoring-changes-to-spice-up-new-super-netball-season\">tipped the Pies to go deep into the finals</a>. Wrong again. The 2018 Pies lost four of their first five matches, beating only the lowly Thunderbirds, before a flash of brilliance with a five-goal win over the Firebirds in round six suggested the gal\u00e1cticos were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/super-netballs-galacticos-finally-begin-to-speak-the-same-language\">finally starting to speak the same language</a>. But the Colliwobbles returned and the Pies won just one more game for the season.</p> <p>Last year ended with three wins, a draw, 10 losses and certainly no finals, after finishing second last. For the Pies, failure was becoming a habit \u2013 as was success for the Lightning, who went back-to-back. So when the Pies ditched Keppich-Birrell in favour of coach Rob Wright and added back-to-back Lightning premiership pair Geva Mentor and Browne, as well as Nat Medhurst and young Jamaican goaler Shimona Nelson for season 2019, the wary were perhaps understandably widespread. The line-up looked great, unbeatable even. But hadn\u2019t we seen it all before?</p> <p>They won the pre-season #TeamGirls tournament, held in Brisbane in March. After beating the Fever and Swifts and losing to the Giants, they topped their pool and went on to beat the Vixens 39-36 in the grand final, with Nelson starring. Suddenly, the Pies were a force to be reckoned with in 2019.</p> <p>So, after another sip of the Kool-Aid, the Pies were installed as favourites ... again. But when the season proper arrived, they lost to the Giants, Fever, Swifts and Lightning before the World Cup break.It was the same old Collingwood: just not good enough. </p> <p>Yet post World Cup, the Pies have only lost to the Giants and now they\u2019re there, in the finals and have a one-in-four shot at the title. They\u2019ve stuck it out, stuck together and got themselves into a position to finally deliver for the first time in their short existence.</p>",

Like a patsy, as Liz Ellis would say. Collingwood have repeatedly and spectacularly failed to live up to their own and external hype since bursting onto the elite netball scene in a blaze of publicity. Despite a well-funded program, unrivalled training facilities and a roster of world-class talent, the Pies have made an art form of under-delivering \u2013 a netball version of the Colliwobbles. So it is only natural that when the 2019 Pies look like they might produce something special, caution comes to the fore. Or, just maybe, that cup of Kool-Aid looks tempting once again. In beating the Melbourne Vixens by 11 goals in the last home-and-away round on Sunday, the Pies \u2013 who for all money looked out of finals contention a few weeks ago \u2013 snatched fourth spot from the Giants and locked in an improbable finals berth. The win \u2013 led by a rampaging Ash Brazill, who won her third MVP in a row\u2013 was convincing. Against all odds, the Pies are now playing finals and they\u2019re not just making up the numbers. After winning their last three on the trot by an average of eight goals, Collingwood are arguably in the best form of any side in the finals. On Sunday, they will face the Vixens again, but this time in a minor semi-final in Melbourne. The winner advances to a preliminary, against either the Lightning or Swifts on Saturday. Could the Pies once more beat the Vixens, as they have the last three times they\u2019ve met \u2013 twice in the regular season and once at the pre-season #TeamGirls Cup? Or is there one more wobble to come? The seeds of doubt about the Pies\u2019 ability to deliver were sown years ago. Before the start of the 2017 season, they were dubbed netball\u2019s \u201cgal\u00e1cticos\u201d: a band of stars, each so individually talented that collectively, they should have been unbeatable, similar to Real Madrid in the early 2000s. The foundation team, coached by Kristy Keppich-Birrell, was bursting at the seams with then-Diamonds. It featured defensive pair Sharni Layton and April Brandley, midcourt dynamos Kim Ravaillion, Madi Browne and Brazill, and shooter Caitlin Thwaites. With that line-up, the Pies were unbackable favourites for the first Super Netball flag. But they didn\u2019t even come close. They had nine wins that year and just scraped into finals but lost to eventual runners-up, the Giants, in the first week. By the lofty expectations inside and outside the club, season one was an abject failure and left many pundits wishing they had not had taken such a large gulp of said tempting drink when the Lightning lifted the trophy. In season two, Keppich-Birrell added veteran shooter Erin Bell and young defender Matilda Garrett and again, most analysts tipped the Pies to go deep into the finals. Wrong again. The 2018 Pies lost four of their first five matches, beating only the lowly Thunderbirds, before a flash of brilliance with a five-goal win over the Firebirds in round six suggested the gal\u00e1cticos were finally starting to speak the same language. But the Colliwobbles returned and the Pies won just one more game for the season. Last year ended with three wins, a draw, 10 losses and certainly no finals, after finishing second last. For the Pies, failure was becoming a habit \u2013 as was success for the Lightning, who went back-to-back. So when the Pies ditched Keppich-Birrell in favour of coach Rob Wright and added back-to-back Lightning premiership pair Geva Mentor and Browne, as well as Nat Medhurst and young Jamaican goaler Shimona Nelson for season 2019, the wary were perhaps understandably widespread. The line-up looked great, unbeatable even. But hadn\u2019t we seen it all before? They won the pre-season #TeamGirls tournament, held in Brisbane in March. After beating the Fever and Swifts and losing to the Giants, they topped their pool and went on to beat the Vixens 39-36 in the grand final, with Nelson starring. Suddenly, the Pies were a force to be reckoned with in 2019. So, after another sip of the Kool-Aid, the Pies were installed as favourites ... again. But when the season proper arrived, they lost to the Giants, Fever, Swifts and Lightning before the World Cup break.It was the same old Collingwood: just not good enough. Yet post World Cup, the Pies have only lost to the Giants and now they\u2019re there, in the finals and have a one-in-four shot at the title. They\u2019ve stuck it out, stuck together and got themselves into a position to finally deliver for the first time in their short existence.",

      "bodyText": "Opera singer Placido Domingo on Sunday received a standing ovation at the Salzburg festival, his first performance after being accused of sexually harassing women. \u201cTriumph in Salzburg, standing ovation for Domingo despite the Me Too affair,\u201d read a headline in the regional daily Kleine Zeitung, following his performance in the Giuseppe Verdi opera Luisa Miller at the annual music and drama festival in Austria. According to reports, Domingo received an ovation alone at the start of the show, and shared in another with his cast-mates at the end. Eight singers and a dancer told the Associated Press earlier this month they were sexually harassed by the former member of the much-lauded Three Tenors, in incidents that date back to the 1980s. In the AP report, several women \u2013 one of whom was identified \u2013 accused Domingo of using his position as one of opera\u2019s most celebrated singers to pressure them into sexual relationships. In a statement, Domingo said the allegations \u201care deeply troubling, and as presented, inaccurate\u201d. He continued: \u201cI believed that all of my interactions and relationships were always welcomed and consensual \u2026 However, I recognise that the rules and standards by which we are \u2013 and should be \u2013 measured against today are very different than they were in the past.\u201d The Los Angeles Opera, of which Domingo is director, has opened an investigation into the \u201cconcerning allegations\u201d. Following the claims, the Philadelphia Orchestra Association withdrew its invitation for Domingo to appear in its opening night concert on 18 September. However, the head of the Salzburg festival in Austria said Domingo would perform there as planned. Madrid-born Domingo was one of the most recognised tenors of the 20th century, starring in the Three Tenors alongside Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras. In recent years the opera star has transformed himself into a baritone and still performs to packed audiences at the age of 78. He has made more than 100 albums and picked up 14 Grammy awards. Earlier this year, he celebrated his 4,000th performance in a career that stretches back 60 years. \u2022 Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",
