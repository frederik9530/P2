      "body": "<p>It doesn\u2019t take long into Rachel Griffiths\u2019 debut directorial feature film, Ride Like a Girl, to be struck by the realisation that this is play-to-the-bleachers entertainment, loaded with Hallmark sentiment and configured with an atmospheric integrity a cut above a soft drink commercial.</p> <p>It is a biopic of Michelle Payne from central Victoria who, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/03/get-stuffed-how-michelle-payne-and-family-beat-odds-to-win-melbourne-cup\">in 2015, became the first </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/03/get-stuffed-how-michelle-payne-and-family-beat-odds-to-win-melbourne-cup\">female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup</a>. The film reaches a high-water mark of cinematic schmaltz in, well, water, during a sequence capturing Payne (Teresa Palmer) connecting with \u201cthe one\u201d \u2013 her horse, Prince of Penzance. This takes place on a beach and is captured in long shots, with small waves and globs of sea foam rolling gently into the shore while panpipes play on the soundtrack. I wouldn\u2019t have blinked if the voice of Daryl Braithwaite had been injected into this moment, crooning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnigc08J6FI\">that song</a> about odd-toed ungulates running in the clouds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/08/from-the-nightingale-to-charles-manson-twice-why-damon-herriman-is-the-scariest-man-in-film\">From The Nightingale to Charles Manson (twice): why Damon Herriman is the scariest man in film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe only thing that matters are the odds you give yourself,\u201d Payne\u2019s father Paddy (Sam Neill) tells his daughter, going on about something called \u201cthe gap\u201d \u2013 which apparently is the all-important moment during which a horse race is won or lost. You can probably guess which big event Payne is psyching herself up for when dad\u2019s words return to her mind and travel through the speakers once more, highlighting the bit in the script marked \u201che\u2019s with you in spirit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2aa5a9a47204b170b45ec3e368fe5beb8255832e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2aa5a9a47204b170b45ec3e368fe5beb8255832e/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teresa Palmer and Sam Neill in Ride Like A Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teresa Palmer and Sam Neill in Ride Like A Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lachlan Moore/Transmission Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Somewhere, at the back of all this, there are the bones of an uplifting story about Payne, who pursued her dreams with grit and tenacity, overcoming great physical and mental hardship. The best part of Ride Like a Girl is Teresa Palmer\u2019s portrayal of her. Palmer is an actor with a great presence and a commanding ability to project inner strength. There is also a small but sweet performance from Payne\u2019s real-life brother Stevie, who has Down\u2019s syndrome and plays himself.</p> <p>By the point at which Paddy\u2019s sage advice has returned via voice-over, various other wishy-washy moments have transpired, in a film drawn to mawkish sentiment as if by magnet. These include training montages set to subtext-spelling songs such as the Cranberries\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yam5uK6e-bQ\">Dreams</a> (\u201cOh my life, is changing every day \u2026 \u201d).</p> <p>Clearly marketed as inoffensive feel-good pap, I didn\u2019t go into the film expecting a nuanced commentary on the racing industry. But nor did I expect what often felt like a thinly veiled 98-minute advertisement, interspersed with occasional moments of warmth and humanity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2a7044f390d14322f1dc97e6a59c3a9c101c261\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2a7044f390d14322f1dc97e6a59c3a9c101c261/0_0_2300_1725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman riding a horse in the surf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is a film that cares for animals only in terms of their ability to adorn pretty sunshine-tinted pictures.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lachlan Moore/Transmission Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Immediately after the credits rolled, I wondered aloud to my companion whether the film was a puff piece for the horse racing industry. An industry that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/10/horse-racing-lobby-has-access-to-nsw-politicians-and-gives-gifts-documents-show\">well-connected to politicians</a>, mired in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/30/police-raid-stables-of-darren-weir-melbourne-cup-winning-trainer\">controversies</a> and frequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/melbourne-cup-horse-racing\">accused of cruelty to animals</a>, both in Australia and overseas. Indeed, animal rights activists <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/animal-activists-disrupt-melbourne-s-ride-like-a-girl-film-premiere-20190908-p52p87.html\">stormed its premiere screening</a>, reportedly interrupting speeches and being dragged away by security \u2013 though the cinema I attended was free of the real-life drama.</p> <p>When I asked whether Ride Like a Girl was financed by the racing industry, the film\u2019s producer, Richard Keddie said: \u201cRacing Victoria and TabCorp supported the production of the film through a sponsorship arrangement with the producers. They had no editorial control or influence over the content of the film.\u201d</p> <p>The film\u2019s moments of humanity occur in scenes exploring the relationship between Payne, Paddy and Stevie (the family consisted of 10 children, all of whom, other than Payne and Stevie, receive little screen time). One scene contains a sneeze-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it reference to a protest happening outside a race track, but that\u2019s it when it comes to acknowledging anything remotely untoward about the horse racing industry. This is a film that cares for animals only in terms of their ability to adorn pretty sunshine-tinted pictures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/15/angel-of-mine-review-noomi-rapace-radiates-with-dangerous-longing\">Angel of Mine review \u2013 Noomi Rapace radiates with dangerous longing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea that you cannot make an inspiring movie set in the Australian horse racing industry while also being truthful is, by the way, demonstrably untrue. The 1983 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/phar-lap-rewatched-the-mystery-demise-of-australias-finest-race-horse\">Phar Lap</a> explores a national icon and shows a beautiful side to horse riding, but doesn\u2019t turn a blind eye to the grim realities of racing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a21db0bf6f8b2237fb8988172781d2a399ad3824\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a21db0bf6f8b2237fb8988172781d2a399ad3824/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two men and a woman in jockey colours sit against a wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s as if the film-makers were afraid of making a point about systematic sexism.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Transmission Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did surprise me, however, was Ride Like a Girl\u2019s meekness as a commentary on gender bias and sexism within the racing industry. I assumed this would be core to its premise, but the film-makers evidently felt otherwise. Several scenes depict Payne in rooms full of men, and there\u2019s one moment in which she is told that the official odds of her winning are \u201c100 to one\u201d but \u201cyou\u2019d be half that if you were a bloke\u201d.</p> <p>There is little else, other than a general sense of a woman toiling away in a male-dominated industry. It\u2019s as if the film-makers were afraid of making a point about systematic sexism and the oppressive state of the patriarchy. Griffiths and her screenwriters, Andrew Knight and Elise McCredie, seem to have stuck their fingers in their ears, stripping the film of almost anything that might be considered remotely political or provocative.</p> <p>Ride Like a Girl is based on a real story, but little about it rings true. I came out of the cinema feeling bloated, as if I\u2019d wolfed down a chunk of cheddar the size of a car battery.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Ride Like A Girl is out in Australian cinemas on 26 September</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It doesn\u2019t take long into Rachel Griffiths\u2019 debut directorial feature film, Ride Like a Girl, to be struck by the realisation that this is play-to-the-bleachers entertainment, loaded with Hallmark sentiment and configured with an atmospheric integrity a cut above a soft drink commercial. It is a biopic of Michelle Payne from central Victoria who, in 2015, became the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup. The film reaches a high-water mark of cinematic schmaltz in, well, water, during a sequence capturing Payne (Teresa Palmer) connecting with \u201cthe one\u201d \u2013 her horse, Prince of Penzance. This takes place on a beach and is captured in long shots, with small waves and globs of sea foam rolling gently into the shore while panpipes play on the soundtrack. I wouldn\u2019t have blinked if the voice of Daryl Braithwaite had been injected into this moment, crooning that song about odd-toed ungulates running in the clouds. \u201cThe only thing that matters are the odds you give yourself,\u201d Payne\u2019s father Paddy (Sam Neill) tells his daughter, going on about something called \u201cthe gap\u201d \u2013 which apparently is the all-important moment during which a horse race is won or lost. You can probably guess which big event Payne is psyching herself up for when dad\u2019s words return to her mind and travel through the speakers once more, highlighting the bit in the script marked \u201che\u2019s with you in spirit\u201d. Somewhere, at the back of all this, there are the bones of an uplifting story about Payne, who pursued her dreams with grit and tenacity, overcoming great physical and mental hardship. The best part of Ride Like a Girl is Teresa Palmer\u2019s portrayal of her. Palmer is an actor with a great presence and a commanding ability to project inner strength. There is also a small but sweet performance from Payne\u2019s real-life brother Stevie, who has Down\u2019s syndrome and plays himself. By the point at which Paddy\u2019s sage advice has returned via voice-over, various other wishy-washy moments have transpired, in a film drawn to mawkish sentiment as if by magnet. These include training montages set to subtext-spelling songs such as the Cranberries\u2019 Dreams (\u201cOh my life, is changing every day \u2026 \u201d). Clearly marketed as inoffensive feel-good pap, I didn\u2019t go into the film expecting a nuanced commentary on the racing industry. But nor did I expect what often felt like a thinly veiled 98-minute advertisement, interspersed with occasional moments of warmth and humanity. Immediately after the credits rolled, I wondered aloud to my companion whether the film was a puff piece for the horse racing industry. An industry that is well-connected to politicians, mired in controversies and frequently accused of cruelty to animals, both in Australia and overseas. Indeed, animal rights activists stormed its premiere screening, reportedly interrupting speeches and being dragged away by security \u2013 though the cinema I attended was free of the real-life drama. When I asked whether Ride Like a Girl was financed by the racing industry, the film\u2019s producer, Richard Keddie said: \u201cRacing Victoria and TabCorp supported the production of the film through a sponsorship arrangement with the producers. They had no editorial control or influence over the content of the film.\u201d The film\u2019s moments of humanity occur in scenes exploring the relationship between Payne, Paddy and Stevie (the family consisted of 10 children, all of whom, other than Payne and Stevie, receive little screen time). One scene contains a sneeze-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it reference to a protest happening outside a race track, but that\u2019s it when it comes to acknowledging anything remotely untoward about the horse racing industry. This is a film that cares for animals only in terms of their ability to adorn pretty sunshine-tinted pictures. The idea that you cannot make an inspiring movie set in the Australian horse racing industry while also being truthful is, by the way, demonstrably untrue. The 1983 film Phar Lap explores a national icon and shows a beautiful side to horse riding, but doesn\u2019t turn a blind eye to the grim realities of racing. What did surprise me, however, was Ride Like a Girl\u2019s meekness as a commentary on gender bias and sexism within the racing industry. I assumed this would be core to its premise, but the film-makers evidently felt otherwise. Several scenes depict Payne in rooms full of men, and there\u2019s one moment in which she is told that the official odds of her winning are \u201c100 to one\u201d but \u201cyou\u2019d be half that if you were a bloke\u201d. There is little else, other than a general sense of a woman toiling away in a male-dominated industry. It\u2019s as if the film-makers were afraid of making a point about systematic sexism and the oppressive state of the patriarchy. Griffiths and her screenwriters, Andrew Knight and Elise McCredie, seem to have stuck their fingers in their ears, stripping the film of almost anything that might be considered remotely political or provocative. Ride Like a Girl is based on a real story, but little about it rings true. I came out of the cinema feeling bloated, as if I\u2019d wolfed down a chunk of cheddar the size of a car battery. \u2022 Ride Like A Girl is out in Australian cinemas on 26 September",

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/the-guardian-view-on-thomas-cook-wiped-out-by-debt?CMP=share_btn_tw\">In an editorial tonight</a>, The Guardian argues that the government was right to resist Thomas Cook\u2019s call for a \u00a3250m lifeline.</strong></p> \n  <p>Why? Because the holiday firm\u2019s problems run pretty deep!

Whether it survives the current crisis or not, Condor - which has been up for sale for some time - is now said to be more vulnerable to a takeover by Lufthansa, which had so far turned down offers to buy the company arguing the asking price was too high. </p> \n  <p>There\u2019s much discussion here about the UK government having to step in to bring the customers home. In Germany customers are covered for such eventualities by an insurance policy which repatriates them in case of a company going bankrupt, though the limit that will be paid out is \u20ac110m, which in a case of this scale would probably be inadequate. </p> \n  <p>There is speculation that Thomas Cook GmbH, the umbrella for the German subsidiaries, could be forced into bancruptcy, though that is considered unlikely. However industry observers are in agreement that is is appalling news for its reputation and could have a nasty knock on effect, with people likely to want to avoid the Thomas Cook brand in the near future out of fear they too will see their holidays go up in smoke. As a result, shares in the main rival, TUI, shot up by 10% this morning. Shares in airlines also went up, explained by traders as reaction to the fact that Thomas Cooks\u2019 demise has taken capacity out of the market. Lufthansa shares were up by 1.8%. </p> \n  <p>The media here are meanwhile referring to this quite openly as \u201cthe first Brexit bankruptcy\u2019, put down in part to people putting off booking holidays to Europe due to huge uncertainty, and to the fall in the pound. There is speculation over the British government\u2019s decision to insist on referring to the repatriation mission as \u201cthe biggest peace-time operation of its kind\u201d, with at least one commentator suggesting it is trying to pose as a saviour to divert from the Brexit chaos. </p> \n  <p>In one \u2018obituary\u2019 of Thomas Cook on the radio this morning there was a wry remark about how it had started as a company offering excursions for the abstinent \u201cwhich is obviously not the case today when you observe Britons on holiday\u201d, the commentator said.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d88e44f8f0834740f3c0b66\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T15:36:13.219Z\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>In a kind touch, Peterborough United football team are inviting Thomas Cook workers to attend this weekend\u2019s home game for free.</strong></p> \n  <p>That\u2019s a nice gesture to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/sep/23/thomas-cook-travel-chaos-insolvency-leaves-150000-stranded-on-holidays-live-updates?page=with:block-5d88df508f08f30dc5bc0d5b#block-5d88df508f08f30dc5bc0d5b\"> the 1,000 workers at its Peterborough HQ who got the grim news this morning</a>.</p> \n  <p>The clubs says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The football club and Thomas Cook have enjoyed a long-standing relationship since the travel business moved its headquarters to the city in 1977 with Thomas Cook sponsoring our shirts and the South Stand for a prolonged period in the \u201890s. </p> \n   <p>Thomas Cook employees must visit the Ticket Office at the Weston Homes Stadium and provide proof of employment to secure their free match ticket.

These repatriation flights will only be operating for the next two weeks (until 6 October 2019). After this date you will have to make your own travel arrangements.

The Press Association has looked at some of the key numbers involved in the operation: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>All of the travel company\u2019s flights have been cancelled - that means the 105 aircraft it operates, according to its website, have been grounded. <br><br></li> \n   <li>There are 600,000 Thomas Cook travellers who have been left stuck overseas. <br><br></li> \n   <li>More than 150,000 of those are Britons. <br><br></li> \n   <li>The airlift is almost twice the size of the repatriation effort required when Monarch went bust in October 2017. <br><br></li> \n   <li>In that instance, the CAA put on 567 flights which brought almost 84,000 passengers back to the UK. <br><br></li> \n   <li>The final cost of the Monarch operation to taxpayers was about \u00a350m. The Department for Transport would not put a firm figure on how much it would cost this time around but it is understood it could top \u00a3100m. <br><br></li> \n   <li>Dozens of charter planes have been brought in from as far afield as Malaysia to assist with the mass airlift. <br><br></li> \n   <li>Only holidaymakers with return flights booked within the next two weeks, between Monday and Sunday 6 October, will qualify for a free flight home, as close as possible to their original return date. <br><br></li> \n   <li>On Monday 30 September, one week into the repatriation process, the CAA will launch a service which will seek to process all refunds within 60 days of full information being received.

All Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and holidays, have now been cancelled. There are currently more than 150,000 Thomas Cook customers abroad, almost twice the number that were repatriated following the failure of Monarch.</p> \n   <p>We know that a company with such long-standing history ceasing trading will be very distressing for its customers and employees and our thoughts are with everyone affected by this news.<br></p> \n   <p>The Government has asked the UK Civil Aviation Authority to launch a repatriation programme over the next two weeks, from Monday 23 September to Sunday 6 October, to bring Thomas Cook customers back to the UK. Due to the unprecedented number of UK customers currently overseas who are affected by the situation, the Civil Aviation Authority has secured a fleet of aircraft from around the world to bring passengers back to the UK with return flights.<br></p> \n   <p>Passengers in a small number of destinations may return on alternative commercial flights, rather than directly through the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s flying programme. Details and advice for these passengers are available on the dedicated website.<br></p> \n   <p>The Civil Aviation Authority has launched a special website, thomascook.caa.co.uk, where affected customers can find details and information on repatriation flights, as well as advice on accommodation for both ATOL and non-ATOL customers.<br></p> \n   <p>Due to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the Civil Aviation Authority will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates. This will apply to both ATOL protected passengers and those who are not protected.<br></p> \n   <p>Customers currently overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated website.<br></p> \n   <p>Thomas Cook customers in the UK yet to travel should not go to the airport as all flights leaving the UK have been cancelled.<br></p> \n   <p>ATOL Protected passengers with future bookings are entitled to a full refund for their cancelled holiday. Passengers currently overseas may also make claims for the cost of replacing ATOL protected parts of their trip, or for out of pocket expenses as a result of delayed flights home. The Civil Aviation Authority will be launching a service to manage all refunds by Monday 30 September, once the flying operation has progressed. This refunds service will seek to process all refunds within 60 days of full information being received.<br></p> \n   <p>Further information will be available on our dedicated website in the coming days, but please do not submit anything to the Civil Aviation Authority in the meantime as the organisation continues to focus on the repatriation flying programme to return more than 150,000 passengers to the UK.

Will I get my money back? Your questions answered</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019ve had a few people tweet in with questions (please get in touch if you\u2019re affected, share your story, pics of your situation, questions etc - kate.lyons@theguardian.com or on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsKateLyons\">Twitter</a>).</p> \n  <p>We have put together an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/23/thomas-cook-collapse-your-questions-answered\">article addressing some of these questions</a>. There is more information in the full article, but here are some answers to the most common questions I\u2019ve received \u2013 about how to get home and what happens to already-booked holidays.</p> \n  <h2>If you are abroad on a Thomas Cook holiday, will you be flown back home?<br></h2> \n  <p>Yes, according to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who told the BBC that contingency planning was in place to make sure no-one would be stranded. The repatriation plan, which has been codenamed Operation Matterhorn, will involve planes chartered from other airlines including British Airways and easyJet. The operation is likely to be a mammoth challenge for the Civil Aviation Authority, on a scale significantly larger than the last major collapse, when <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2017/oct/02/monarch-airlines-flights-cancelled-as-airline-goes-into-administration\">Monarch Airlines was grounded in October 2017</a>.</p> \n  <p>The initial advice is likely to be that holidaymakers should not make their way to the airport until notified, as flights are unlikely to be available immediately. Be prepared for possible delays, and the risk that you may be flown back to a different UK airport to the one you took off from, then bussed to your initial departure point.</p> \n  <p>However, the good news is that the Monarch rescue went relatively smoothly. Over the course of two weeks in October 2017 the CAA chartered 560 flights from 24 different airlines, and 98% of Monarch passengers were flown home on the same day they were originally booked to return.</p> \n  <h2>You have a booking with Thomas Cook for a holiday next week. What happens to it?</h2> \n  <p>It\u2019s very likely you won\u2019t be jetting off to the sun, but you will get the money back that you paid for the Thomas Cook holiday. The CAA will set out how to make a claim for a refund \u2013 go to <a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/atol-protection/\">caa.co.uk/atol-protection/</a></p> \n  <p>In some circumstances, Atol may appoint what it calls a \u201cfulfilment partner\u201d to provide the holiday instead, although this is more likely for holidays booked further in advance.</p> \n  <h2>Are you covered if you have bought a flight-only deal on Thomas Cook Airlines?</h2> \n  <p>Unlikely. Atol was set up to protect holidaymakers who buy package deals, not people putting together holidays on their own over the internet. But there can be some exceptions, such as if the passenger bought the ticket through an Atol licenced travel agent. However, if you booked directly with the airline it is unlikely you will be covered. When <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2008/sep/12/theairlineindustry.travelleisure6\">XL crashed in 2008</a>, the CAA said flight-only customers were at the back of the queue, and that while it would make efforts to organise cost-only seats, it would not offer any guarantees.<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "This live blog is now closed. Our main story is here. And finally, here come the rest of the UK front pages, with Thomas Cook stories front and centre. The Guardian highlights the claim that UK ministers scuppered hopes of rescuing the company (full story). The Times leads on Boris Johnson\u2019s criticism of the company\u2019s top management, who picked up chunky pay cheques in recent years. The Mirror also scents a new Fat Cat scandal -- angry that Thomas Cook\u2019s top brass are heading into the sunset with millions of pounds. The Daily Mail is equally angry: The Telegraph also finds space for Thomas Cook -- flagging up the prospect of a public inquiry into its demise. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting -- and good luck if you\u2019re stuck abroad, trying to reschedule a holiday, or facing unemployment because of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. Goodnight! GW Attention, Thomas Cook staff: Virgin Airways is looking to hire you. The airline is keen to hear from cabin crew, following Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, although it\u2019s not clear how many roles are actually available yet. Virgin says: \u201cWe have a set up a specific recruitment path to support any Thomas Cook Cabin Crew after the sad announcement that the company has ceased operations. \u201cIf you are committed to the highest professional standards and delivering for our customers then we\u2019d love to talk to you.\u201d The UK government is being accused of sealing Thomas Cook\u2019s fate by not providing financial support, even though Turkey and Spain were prepared to help. Once the government\u2019s lack of confidence in Thomas Cook leaked out, one source says, support in Spain and Turkey for the precariously-constructed deal \u201cmelted away\u201d. \u201cTwo governments were prepared to back a British brand, the UK government wasn\u2019t,\u201d said the source. \u201cWithout that, there wasn\u2019t enough confidence around the table to make it work.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: The Mexican leg of the repatriation programme is continuing: I suspect the Thomas Cook crisis will make the front page of most UK national newspapers tomorrow. The Independent and the Metro have already set the trend: In an editorial tonight, The Guardian argues that the government was right to resist Thomas Cook\u2019s call for a \u00a3250m lifeline. Why? Because the holiday firm\u2019s problems run pretty deep! Here\u2019s a flavour: It is far from clear that the bailout of up to \u00a3250m that the company requested, and ministers refused, would have avoided all this. Thomas Cook almost went bust in 2011 and is colossally in debt due to decisions taken by management teams dating back to its merger with MyTravel in 2007. The 2018 heatwave, which led to reduced bookings, combined with the weakness of sterling and concerns about Brexit, pushed it over the edge. And while a consultation with the workforce, as proposed by Labour\u2019s John McDonnell, would indeed have been preferable to the shock and disruption of the last 24 hours, there was a risk that even the bailout would not have been enough. With the cost of the operation to bring stranded tourists home and pay Thomas Cook\u2019s bills expected to far exceed the initial estimate of \u00a3100m, the risk of pouring public money into the company, only to see it fail anyway, was that taxpayers would have been landed with two bills instead of one. Pressure is mounting on Thomas Cook\u2019s current, and past, management tonight. Andrea Leadsom, Britain\u2019s business secretary, got the ball rolling this morning by asking the Insolvency Service to launch an investigation into the company\u2019s demise. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell then propelled the pay issue into the spotlight, by calling for bonuses to be returned. Now Boris Johnson has weighed in, as the FT explains: Chief executives at Thomas Cook took home \u00a318.7m worth in pay in the past 10 years, according to FT calculations from annual reports, with the current CEO Peter Fankhauser earning about \u00a38.5m in his near five-year tenure. Prime minister Boris Johnson said in New York on Monday night: \u201cI have questions for one about whether it\u2019s right that the directors, or whoever, the board, should pay themselves large sums when businesses can go down the tubes like that.\u201d City speculators found two ways to profit from Thomas Cook\u2019s downfall. One group shorted its shares in recent months - banking profits as the value of the equity shrank to nothing. The second (as flagged earlier) took out insurance on its bonds. Those credit-default swaps (CDS) are expected to pay out some $250m, or \u00a3200m - or roughly the funding shortfall that brought Thomas Cook down. On the other hand, people who bought Thomas Cook\u2019s shares and bonds have lost out (as have whichever banks or insurers took the other side of the CDS contracts). This is helpful too: If you\u2019re struggling to understand how a venerable brand like Thomas Cook can suddenly collapse, look no further than this explainer. Here\u2019s a flavour: Why did Thomas Cook fail after 178 years in business? The immediate answer is that it was unable to secure a \u00a3200m lifeline from its bankers, including government-owned RBS. But in truth the tour operator\u2019s woes go back much further \u2013 a victim of a disastrous merger in 2007, ballooning debts and the internet revolution in holiday booking. Add in Brexit uncertainty, and it was perhaps only a matter of time before the giant of the industry collapsed. In May, the group reported a \u00a31.5bn loss, with more than \u00a31bn written off from the 2007 merger with MyTravel \u2013 better known for its brands Airtours and Going Places. That deal was supposed to create a European giant, promising \u00a375m-a-year cost savings and a springboard to challenge emerging internet rivals. In reality Thomas Cook was merging with a company that had only made a profit once in the previous six years, and the deal saddled the group with huge debts.... Big queues formed at Damalan Airport earlier today, as holidaymakers in Turkey tried to get home. One customer reports that Thomas Cook staff are still toiling away, helping people despite not being paid. Football, rugby and cricket fans who bought package deals through Thomas Cook face disruption following the company\u2019s collapse. Sarah Butler has the details: Sports fans who bought tickets for major football matches and England\u2019s winter cricket tour to South Africa are among those who could be affected by the collapse of Thomas Cook. Thomas Cook Sport, a specialist division of the fallen tour operator, provided tickets and accommodation for some of the UK\u2019s biggest football clubs, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham. It also sold packages for rugby, the NFL, Formula One and darts, including the world championship in December. Scottish rugby fans who bought early for the Six Nations tournament next year are also likely to be affected as the national team had a partnership with Thomas Cook. Officials in the Greater Manchester region are scrambling to help Thomas Cook staff tonight. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham visited Manchester Airport - a key hub for the company - today to speak to workers. And a new website has been created to provide support to people who have lost their jobs, and to help them find vacancies. It\u2019s here: https://gmthomascook.com/ or you could email info@gmthomascook.com. Around 3,000 people were working for Thomas Cook in Greater Manchester, with more than 900 cabin crew helping 2.8 million travellers through Manchester Airport each year, a tenth of the airport\u2019s passenger numbers. Burnham says: \u201cMy heart goes out to all those affected by the collapse of Thomas Cook. I have been at the airport today meeting staff representatives and I know this news has hit them very hard, leaving them without a job and in many cases three weeks\u2019 pay. \u201cBut we need to give people more than just warm words, which is why we have been working hard today to put in place practical support. The Greater Manchester family has been swift to respond and it\u2019s good that a website and contact telephone number have been established where staff can log on, register and access practical support and information when it comes to next steps.\u201d Our colleague in Mexico, Jo Tuckman, reports that the first Thomas Cook repatriation flight is due to leave Canc\u00fan for Gatwick via Manchester at 15:55 Mexican time (or 21.55 BST). Another one is due to depart for Manchester at 17:05 local time, bringing another planeload of holidaymakers home. Here\u2019s a touching story. We\u2019ve just heard that the flight to return Thomas Cook passengers from Mah\u00f3n airport,Menorca, to Bristol has just touched down. During the journey, passengers organised a collection for staff - raising \u00a3125 in sterling,\u20ac220 in euros and a mountain of loose change. Enough for a \u201cdamn good do\u201d, as one passenger put it as she announced the total. \u201cThe crew were great,\u201d another passenger tells us. But the staff aren\u2019t taking it to the nearest pub. Instead, they say they\u2019ll donate it to charity - one that is helping the sick child of a ground crew member. The collapse of Thomas Cook today has cast a huge cloud of worry over one of its hotels, half an hour\u2019s drive southwest of Palma airport. Our colleague Sam Jones is there, and reports: Since early Monday morning, according to guests at the Sentido Cala Vi\u00f1as hotel, there had been only one topic of conversation over the breakfast table and around the pool. \u201cMy son texted me this morning and asked me how I was going to get home,\u201d said Ole S\u00f8yland, a 61-year-old Norwegian who was staying at the hotel with his wife. \u201cI thought he was asking who was going to drive us back home from the airport, but then I looked in the Norwegian papers and saw what was going on.\u201d Thomas Cook, he added, were giving guests \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d when it came to information and were not responding to his texts. \u201cI asked the receptionist about it but she said that Scandinavia wasn\u2019t affected, but of course we\u2019re all involved. I hope we get some information on Wednesday, otherwise we\u2019ll have to start looking at our options.\u201d S\u00f8yland was also wondering whether he would need to get his prescription filled in Spain. A British couple from Burton-on-Trent, who did not wish to be named, said they had been loyal to Thomas Cook for years and were sad to see it collapse. But they were far from happy about the company\u2019s failure to update customers. They said: \u201cAll the information we\u2019re getting is off the telly. It\u2019s the old people who are staying here that we feel sorry for. It\u2019s not very nice for them and they\u2019re worried about it. You could just tell the atmosphere was different this morning.\u201d There\u2019s been a big political row over Thomas Cook today. The government insists it was right not to intervene and risk taxpapers\u2019 money, while and Labour and the unions criticised its refusal to help save thousands of jobs and hundreds of thousands of holidays. Here\u2019s the details: Here\u2019s our news story about the passengers who should have been heading on holiday today: Reminder: if you\u2019re caught up in Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, the Civil Aviation Authority has a website with information. Over in Greece urgent measures to deal with the financial fallout of Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation are being discussed at a cabinet meeting attended by the national economy and tourism ministers. The meeting, which also includes prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019 top aide in charge of coordinating government policy, will focus on expediting repatriation of stranded tourists and relief measures for businesses worst hit by the company\u2019s collapse. The conservative government has hinted that tax cuts might be in the offing. Grigoris Tasios, who heads the Hellenic Hoteliers\u2019 Association, told the Guardian this afternoon that the country\u2019s tourism sector had been hit by losses of around 300 million euro \u201cand that\u2019s an initial estimate and rather conservative.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an economic disaster,\u201d he said warning there would be legal action. \u201cThe company hasn\u2019t paid hotels or anyone here for the last three months. Who is going to cover such losses? The British government? From my experience that never happens. It\u2019s going to be a huge problem and the big players won\u2019t sit idle. Court action will be pursued. Thomas Cook customer Vivienne Cameron is at Lanzarote Airport, and reports that British Embassy staff have arrived to help. There\u2019s a long queue already, so they should be busy. Thomas Cook is also dominating the headlines in Germany, not least because the bankruptcy affects an estimated 140,000 German customers who are currently on holidays booked via five German subsidiaries of Thomas Cook, the largest of which is Neckermann. Condor, the main German subsidiary, which flies German Thomas Cook customers to their destinations has reached out to the German government this morning, requesting a bridging loan of 200 million Euros this morning, but insists it\u2019s not in trouble it just needs liquidity at a difficult time. The government has yet to announce whether it will grant the loan. Whether it survives the current crisis or not, Condor - which has been up for sale for some time - is now said to be more vulnerable to a takeover by Lufthansa, which had so far turned down offers to buy the company arguing the asking price was too high. There\u2019s much discussion here about the UK government having to step in to bring the customers home. In Germany customers are covered for such eventualities by an insurance policy which repatriates them in case of a company going bankrupt, though the limit that will be paid out is \u20ac110m, which in a case of this scale would probably be inadequate. There is speculation that Thomas Cook GmbH, the umbrella for the German subsidiaries, could be forced into bancruptcy, though that is considered unlikely. However industry observers are in agreement that is is appalling news for its reputation and could have a nasty knock on effect, with people likely to want to avoid the Thomas Cook brand in the near future out of fear they too will see their holidays go up in smoke. As a result, shares in the main rival, TUI, shot up by 10% this morning. Shares in airlines also went up, explained by traders as reaction to the fact that Thomas Cooks\u2019 demise has taken capacity out of the market. Lufthansa shares were up by 1.8%. The media here are meanwhile referring to this quite openly as \u201cthe first Brexit bankruptcy\u2019, put down in part to people putting off booking holidays to Europe due to huge uncertainty, and to the fall in the pound. There is speculation over the British government\u2019s decision to insist on referring to the repatriation mission as \u201cthe biggest peace-time operation of its kind\u201d, with at least one commentator suggesting it is trying to pose as a saviour to divert from the Brexit chaos. In one \u2018obituary\u2019 of Thomas Cook on the radio this morning there was a wry remark about how it had started as a company offering excursions for the abstinent \u201cwhich is obviously not the case today when you observe Britons on holiday\u201d, the commentator said. In a kind touch, Peterborough United football team are inviting Thomas Cook workers to attend this weekend\u2019s home game for free. That\u2019s a nice gesture to the 1,000 workers at its Peterborough HQ who got the grim news this morning. The clubs says: The football club and Thomas Cook have enjoyed a long-standing relationship since the travel business moved its headquarters to the city in 1977 with Thomas Cook sponsoring our shirts and the South Stand for a prolonged period in the \u201890s. Thomas Cook employees must visit the Ticket Office at the Weston Homes Stadium and provide proof of employment to secure their free match ticket. Additional tickets for the children of those affected are also available for a nominal fee. Peterborough are playing AFC Wimbledon: both teams need the points after a tough start to the season, so it could be a lively game. The town of Peterborough, in Cambridgeshire, is reeling from the collapse of Thomas Cook. The holiday firm employed 1,000 people at its Lynch Wood headquarters in Peterborough, who now face losing their jobs. Staff have been leaving the HQ today, after hearing it has gone into liquidation. According to Sky News, some staff have been told they won\u2019t be paid at the end of the month unless they contact the insolvency service. YouGov have conducted a snap poll today, which found that a majority (54%) of people think the government was right not to step in and save Thomas Cook. Nearly a quarter (22%) think Boris Johnson should have intervened, with the rest not sure. Nearly two-thirds (63%) reckon the company would have still collapsed, even if it had received more help. One Thomas Cook holiday maker has described emotional scenes on his flight home to Gatwick airport during the early hours of Monday morning. Charity worker Joe Jeness, 34, and his partner Gaynor were on one of the last scheduled flights from Lanzarote to London when the Captain announced over the tannoy system that the travel company had gone into receivership. \u201cIt was really sad.\u201d Jeness said, responding to our callout to readers today. \u201cI asked one of the air hostesses if she was ok and she replied \u201cSuch is life.\u201d He said that the plane crew remained stoic and and professional during the flight. \u201cIt was a very bumpy flight and one woman was really upset and she was attended to by one of the cabin crew. It was amazing how caring she was considering the circumstances.\u201d He added: \u201cAfter we touched down though the crew were visibly upset. One of the air hostesses had tears in her eyes when we got off the plane and we saw others hugging each other. \u201cThe Captain came and stood at the exit with the crew and every passenger who got off the plane wished them well. It was heartbreaking.\u201d A long queue of British passengers on Thomas Cook holidays has formed at Antalya airport, in Turkey: Spanish airport operator AENA says that 46 flights operated by Thomas Cook have been disrupted today, mostly in the Spanish Balearic and Canary archipelagos. This is the way Thomas Cook\u2019s world ends, with a shutter descending at its branch in Finaghy, Belfast. Another wedding is facing ruin -- and bizarrely the groom-to-be is one Thomas Cook.... The Nottingham Post has the details: A devastated groom who shares the same name as the failed holiday company Thomas Cook has been left \u201cshattered\u201d after his wedding in Rhodes looks unlikely to go ahead. Thomas, 29, and his partner Amelia Binch, 27, from Hucknall, are stuck in Rhodes in Greece after booking the dream getaway and wedding package with Thomas Cook. They flew out on September 18 and are due to marry at the Lindos Princess hotel on September 27. Guests are due to fly out with Thomas Cook over the coming days, including the best man. But the couple have been told the wedding might not go ahead, as the Thomas Cook package included the wedding ceremony, flowers, cake, decorations and entertainment. More here..... Good news. We\u2019ve just heard that most of the delayed flights from Mah\u00f3n, in Menorca, to the UK have now departed. The Bristol flight is still delayed, but has a departure time now. Our ears on the ground say that Thomas Cook staff have arrived to help, even though they\u2019re not being paid any more. A credit to the company. Here\u2019s a video clip of some Thomas Cook passengers returning home today, and wishing the company \u201cgood luck\u201d. And here\u2019s a tribute from a pilot, with some impressive video clips from the cockpit. Time for a quick recap Britain\u2019s biggest repatriation effort since the second world war is underway, following the collapse of Thomas Cook in the early hours of this morning. Some 600,000 passengers are affected, with 150,000 UK citizens stranded abroad. The Civil Aviation Authority has organised a squadron of planes from other operators to bring people home -- but transport secretary Grant Shapps has warned the operation may not go smoothly. The CAA\u2019s head, Dame Deirdre Hutton, has pledged; \u201cEvery single person will be brought back home at the end of their holiday. Everyone will be brought home free of charge.\u201d The government says: \u201cFor flights back to the UK, it doesn\u2019t matter whether customers are ATOL protected or not, or what their nationality is. Everyone on a Thomas Cook holiday with a return flight to the UK within the two weeks will be brought home.\u201d But....passengers are facing delays at airports across Europe, and beyond. In Palma, people have been waiting for hours for information - despite UK government officials, ATOL staff, and CAA representatives all arriving to help. It\u2019s a similar tale in Menorca, where flights back to Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Bristol are all delayed Some passengers are also facing delays in Tunisia, as there wasn\u2019t enough room for them all on today\u2019s plane. Some 50,000 people are stuck in Greece..... while Turkey\u2019s government has warned hotels not to throw guests out. Thomas Cook\u2019s check-ins at UK airports are silent, apart from a few customers trying desperately to rebook. At Gatwick, one customers say they were \u201cscammed\u201d by Thomas Cook, while others are struggling to rebook flights. In Manchester, passengers say prices for alternative flights are rising sharply... ... just like shares in rival operators such as TUI (up 6% today). Experts have predicted that Thomas Cook\u2019s demise will allow surviving rivals to push prices up. Several weddings have also been disrupted, with one couple having to stump up thousands of pounds to get to Kos in time. The government has defended its decision not to give Thomas Cook a \u00a3250m bailout, arguing that it would create a \u2018morale hazard\u2019. But in Germany, Thomas Cook\u2019s own airline, Condor, is seeking financial aid to keep flying. The Labour Party is urging the government to step in, and pressing Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses to return their bonuses. Unions have also criticised the government for not doing more. But the crisis is good news for one group -- hedge funds who bet on Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. They could win \u00a3250m through credit default swaps. Please get in touch if you\u2019ve been affected by Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. Here\u2019s Sam Jones\u2019s report from Palma airport: Back in Tunisia, Simon Speakman Cordall has heard that a flight to repatriate Thomas Cook customers left from Enfidha Airport today. However, there wasn\u2019t room for \u201cupwards of 30 people\u201d who are now being bussed back to Harramet. They\u2019ll need to return tomorrow for another flight. Tunisian hoteliers are busy too, including Hichem Hedda, general manager of the Steigenberger Marhaba Thalasso, who\u2019s been up since 4am. They received a written commitment from TSS, (Thomas Cook\u2019s Tunisian agents) around half an hour ago that they would meet all costs incurred so far. That has now gone to the owner for signature. Around 25-30% of the Steigenberger\u2019s business comes through Thomas Cook. However, Hichem is confident others will fill the gap. The hotel has traded since before the Sousse attack in 2015, but was looking forward to the return of British tourists. \u201cThis market is very important for us,\u201d he said. Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse is going to create even more empty shops on the UK\u2019s high streets. According to Estates Gazette, Thomas Cook\u2019s 588-store estate across the UK adds up to c.855,000 sq ft of retail, with the company still operating a (surprising) visible presence. The total retail space vacated since 2018 now over 20m square feet, apparently..... Passengers scheduled to fly out with Thomas Cook today still turned up at Gatwick airport, with several saying they had been unaware of the company\u2019s collapse until they were on their way or upon arrival at the airport. Ruth Caruana, 48, came to the deserted Thomas Cook desk with her husband and daughter to enquire about her flight back home to Malta. \u201cI tried to check in last night, but they wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d Caruana said. At the airport, she was told by a stand-in Tui member of staff that she would have to attempt to rebook with another airline. Caruana told us: \u201cWe booked three weeks ago and paid about \u20ac700. We\u2018ve been scammed, if they knew they were going to close down they shouldn\u2019t have let us buy the tickets. We have nowhere to stay now. I will now try to get another flight, I hope the insurance will cover it,\u201c John Bell and his family also approached the Thomas Cook desk to get information about their flight to Dalaman, Turkey, for a two-week holiday, which puts their return flights outside the two-week period in which stranded passengers with booked plane tickets will be offered an airlift home by the government. \u201cWe found out at half three this morning,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe booked through Love Holidays, and used a credit card, so hopefully that\u2019ll give us some protection. Everything is getting booked up real fast now, so we don\u2019t know when or if we will be going.\u201d Bell said he thought it was possible Brexit had something to do with the downfall of Thomas Cook. \u201cThen again, their troubles have been going on for years.\u201d Friends Judy and Sheila were scheduled to fly out for a 7-day holiday in Antalya and found out about the collapse of the holiday giant when they arrived at Gatwick airport, where they were handed a printed information letter by Thomas Cook. Like many others, they had booked a package via a third party operator, Broadway Travel, a mere two weeks ago, which included flights with Thomas Cook. \u201cWe even have our boarding passes for our flight that is now not going to happen,\u201c Sheila said. \u201cWe were told to try and rebook, our travel operator said we should pay for new tickets and would then get reimbursed, but I\u2018m sure any extras like transfers we\u2018ll have to pay for will leave us out of pocket.\u201c The friends were able to rebook tickets for a flight just before 10pm with another airline, for a small fortune they said, and were told by their travel operator they would be refunded for the original cost of the Thomas Cook flights. \u201cI asked, \u2018what about the additional cost?\u2019, but they haven\u2019t said anything about that,\u201d Judy said. \u201cAll I want to do is lie down,\u201d Sheila added. By midday, only a handful of travellers were queued at the customer service desk to rebook their flights. Carita Kuivamaki, 27 and Niklas Koski, 26, both from Finland but living in Malta, found out on their journey to the airport that their flights home had been scrapped. They had come to London for a company business trip. \u201cWe heard about it on the train,\u201d Koski said. Kuivamaki said they spotted the story of the collapse in a newspaper, adding: We\u2018ll book flights for tomorrow. There are many sad tales of customers whose holiday plans have been ruined by Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse -- but having a wedding disrupted must be a particularly bitter blow. That\u2019s what happened to Layton Roche and Natalie Wells, most unfortunately. They are due to get married on Friday in Kos, Greece, in a wedding they have been planning for years. But they and almost 50 guests booked through Thomas Cook. Kate explains: Roche and Wells, who have been together for seven years, engaged for five and have two children together, spent \u201cmonths and months\u201d researching \u201cto find the perfect place that caters for everyone\u201d. On Monday morning they were up early, getting ready to catch a taxi they had booked for 3am to take them to Manchester airport in time for their 6am flight, when they heard the devastating news: Thomas Cook had gone under, and their flights and those of their guests were cancelled. \u201cA couple of years of planning and a whole lot of money has gone down the drain,\u201d said Roche, a civil engineer. \u201cDreams have been crushed.\u201d Some of their family members, including Roche\u2019s dad and one of their children, were already in Kos waiting for them, and so the couple scrambled to find tickets for other flights bound for the island. They will make it to Greece and their wedding can go ahead, at the cost of \u00a34,000 for last-minute tickets. This means that perhaps only 15 of their nearly 50 guests will be able to make it, due to the expense.... More here: Passengers on one Thomas Cook flight organised a collection for their cabin crew, Sky News reports, after they learned of the company\u2019s collapse. Here\u2019s the story. Over in Greece where 50,000 Thomas Cook clients are stranded, the first flights are en route to repatriate passengers holidaying on the islands of Zakynthos, Corfu and Kos. The country\u2019s tourism minister Haris Theoharis, who has set up an operational centre to coordinate repatriation efforts, says he expects 22,000 passengers to be returned home over the next three days. The ministry is working closely with the British embassy in Athens with the repatriations thought to be overseen by Britain\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority. Attempting to allay fears in a country whose economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism, the minister said hotel costs and other relevant expenses had been covered for Thomas Cook clients. The Greek tourism ministry was working very closely with the national economy ministry and other bodies to support the vast number of Greek companies affected by the British tour operator\u2019s collapse. The vast majority of those marooned in Greece are said to be in Crete. But across the country, especially in the Sporades where 75 % of current hotel guests are British, tourism officials are speaking of the company\u2019s collapse as a catastrophe for already hard hit Greek companies. Alekos Eustathiou, who heads the Union of Hoteliers on Skiathos in the Sporades and represents Thomas Cook, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge economic blow to tourism \u2026 it\u2019s estimated that there are about 1,800 to 2,000 Britons on our islands. Right now the economic damage is impossible to estimate.\u201d Stranded passengers booked to fly on cancelled Thomas Cook flights from Manchester Airport have complained that prices to fly on other airlines are mounting. Aside from the handful of stranded passengers frantically trying to book other flights, the former Thomas Cook check in desks at Terminal one stood eerily silent, empty of staff or queues, with the branding removed. Wedding planner Catalena Fernandes had been due to fly home to Cancun, Mexico this morning. She had been travelling around the UK for two weeks and has two weddings scheduled for this week. \u201cI was looking for information but my flight wasn\u2019t ATOL protected so I cannot claim for a return flight. I can just ask for my money back, but flights [on other airlines] are very expensive right now. I don\u2019t know why my flight wasn\u2019t ATOL-protected. Like any normal person, I booked it, and thought it would be okay.\u201d She added, \u201cI am searching for other flights but I needed to be there today. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. It is a difficult situation.\u201d Kristina Terwilliger was only supposed to be in transit to Manchester but had been stranded for four hours. She had flown from Glasgow, with a flight booked to JFK to visit family on Condor Airlines, a subsidiary owned by Thomas Cook. Last night, the airline said it would continue operations, but Terwilliger arrived in transit to find her flight cancelled. \u201cThey let me through and sent my bag to JFK, it was on the way and they had to get it back. I\u2019ve talked to Condor, there\u2019s no way to get through to Thomas Cook. There\u2019s nothing, no contact with Thomas Cook, no money back. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s just that getting a flight out of here is just hard in general and prices are just going up and up. Everyone is trying to get out of here.\u201d Sidney Matias is trying to get home to Orlando after a holiday in the UK. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve had no information - I bought an extra bag yesterday, which they charged me for, so I woke up this morning and I came to the airport, I didn\u2019t know they were going to be cancelled. The only information is these guys gave me a piece of paper so I\u2019m going to have to buy another flight\u201d. Jerome Sinclair, who works for luxury fashion brand Burberry, was also booked to fly to New York on Condor for work. He said: \u201cI know there had been things on the news, I\u2019d been on holiday the week before so I\u2019d not been following it that closely but I\u2019d not had a phone call or email. My flight was Condor so I was just hoping it would still be running.\u201d \u201cWhen I arrived at security, my boarding card flashed up to seek assistance. So now I\u2019ve got to try to get to New York today from somewhere but the train station is closed.\u201d While the taxpaper faces a \u00a3100m bill to get Thomas Cook\u2019s customers home, investors who bet on the firm\u2019s collapse could enjoy a payday. Bloomberg reports that hedge funds who bet against Thomas Cook\u2019s bonds are in line for a \u00a3250m windfall -- exactly the amount which the government declined to pump into the firm. They\u2019ll profit through credit default swaps - insurance that pays out when a company fails to repay its bonds. Bloomberg says: Not everyone lost out with the collapse of 178-year-old Thomas Cook Group Plc that put 21,000 jobs at risk and left travelers around the world stranded. Speculators including Sona Asset Management and XAIA Investment GmbH stand to earn as much as $250 million from the bankruptcy. They invested in derivatives that pay out when a company defaults. The fate of those securities was at the heart of the battle over whether Thomas Cook lived or died. Bethany Main, 22, from Newcastle is travelling with her partner Rachel Usher 26 and her eight year old son. They have been at Palma airport, Majorca since 08.30 this morning. Describing the scenes there she said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely heaving.\u201d \u201cI think there are more than 1000 people here. Our flight has been delayed from just after 1000 this morning till 1940 tonight and it\u2019s been redirected to Manchester and we don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get home from there.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been told we can\u2019t leave the airport. The Atol desk has given us cups of water but that\u2019s all so far. There are more people coming in all the time ... it\u2019s getting crowded and some people are asleep on the floor.\u201d Reminder: You can get in touch if you\u2019ve been affected. Thameslink, which runs rail services to Luton and Gatwick Airports, is offering support to Thomas Cook customers who no longer need tickets, or miss their train home. Over in Tunisia, customers and Thomas Cook staff are facing up to the disruption together. Journalist Simon Speakman Cordall is at the Sentido Phenicia hotel, on the beach at Hammamet -- the town where some customers were barracaded into their rooms yesterday. All the managers are in a meeting; reception say there are 140 British guests at the hotel. But despite yesterday\u2019s drama (at the Orangers hotel some distance away), all is calm in the Sentido Phenicia\u2019s lobby. Simon reports that : Until this morning Riadh Saidani was a Thomas Cook rep. He and others are now helping guests find flights. He doesn\u2019t know if he will he paid, but left the hotel to distribute homemade flyers with the CAA phone number on it to other hotels. \u201cThere are about 200 Thomas Cook guests here, around 1,000 in Hammamet,\u201d Saidani explained. Simon also talked to Sue McMahoe and Douggie Weston, (79) from Dudley. Both voted to leave in the 2016 EU referendum, and are dismissive of Thomas Cook blaming Brexit for its weak trading. Sue tells us: \u201cWe\u2019ve been going to Tunisia since 1998\u201d Douggie adds: \u201cWe come for the weather and the people mainly. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a shame that It\u2019s been Thomas Cook. They\u2019ve been so good over the years\u201d Neither are very good with computers. However, the former reps here have confirmed their flight and they will leave tomorrow. They have a further holiday, to Egypt, booked through Thomas Cook for the new year and are confident they\u2019ll be reimbursed. Back at Mah\u00f3n, Menorca, there\u2019s little sign of progress for stranded passengers at the airport. The departure hall is packed with tourists hoping to head back to the UK, but their flights to Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Bristol are all delayed. People are being stoic, we hear, but as you can see the check-in desks are besieged. A petition to \u201cSave Thomas Cook\u201d was the fastest-growing petition on Change.org over the weekend, and is still getting signatures today (68,535 at present). It was created by the husband of a Thomas Cook employee, and calls on the government, or another lender, to provide financial help to guarantee a bright future for the firm. It\u2019s online here. Turkey\u2019s ministry of culture and tourism has issued a stern warning to hotels in the country not to kick Thomas Cook customers out, or demand money from them. The ministry is also promising financial help to hotels, though a \u201ccredit loan package\u201d. Flight websites are warning of steep price hikes to come following Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. Routes from Manchester, and to the Caribbean, are most likely to be affected, although the impact may take a while to hit. Jack Sheldon of Jack\u2019s Flight Club said: \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen any immediate increases in fares today. In my experience, when a particular route ceases to operate prices do indeed increase substantially, but this generally occurs over a matter of weeks and months. I expect it will be similar in this case as the additional demand will increase prices on other carriers Apart from easyJet and Ryanair, we expect you\u2019ll see increases on long-haul routes to many Caribbean destination from London and even more so from Manchester, where Thomas Cook was quite dominant, in terms of direct routes to many holiday destinations. We expect Virgin Atlantic to benefit on a number of routes from Manchester (Bridgetown, Orlando, New York), while British Airways will pick up most of the long-haul demand out of Gatwick.\u201d Here\u2019s a video clip of some of the holidaymakers caught up in today\u2019s travel chaos. Some face long delays, and a tricky journey home, while others are unhappy about the (lack of) information from Thomas Cook. Crete is also bracing for heavy financial losses: Speaking of Cyprus... its deputy ministry for tourism has said that up to 15,000 holidaymakers are stranded on the Mediterranean island. Savvas Perdios reckons Cypriot hotels could lose \u20ac50m which is owned by Thomas Cook, warning: \u201cI don\u2019t think that it will be easy to recoup that money.\u201d Thomas Cook had been bringing 250,000 people to Cyprus each year - or 6% of the total tourist trade. Perdios added (via Reuters): \u201cWe will work intensively.. I believe that a large portion of the arrivals we stand to lose will somehow be regulated by the market and other travel agencies.\u201d One Thomas Cook customer has revealed that her plans to fly out to Cyprus to get married are now in tatters: Ditto Manchester: Thomas Cook\u2019s spot at Birmingham Airport is deserted this morning, as customers get the message to stay away. Over in Crete, Thomas Cook holidaymakers have formed a long queue at Heraklion airport, to find out how they\u2019ll get home. As well as its UK customers, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers from other countries are affected by Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. It says that there are currently 140,000 people currently travelling with its German subsidiaries, which include Neckermann and \u00d6ger Tours. They must turn to their insurance companies for help to get home, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports. The head of Turkey\u2019s Hoteliers Federation has warned that Thomas Cook owes money to small hotels in the country (and across the world too). He also fears its collapse could mean up to 700,000 fewer tourists visit Turkey each year, Reuters reports. Thomas Cook\u2019s last ever flight touched down at Manchester Airport a little while ago, Sky News reports: The New York Times\u2019s Matina Stevis-Gridneff fears Greece\u2019s tourism economy will be rocked by Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse: Our man at Palma Airport, Sam Jones, reports that Thomas Cook customers are still waiting to learn how they\u2019ll get home. Despite the heavy presence of Thomas Cook staff and teams from ATOL and the FCO, information and updates are in short supply, he says. Natasha Brown from Newcastle came out to Mallorca for a week to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday. She and her friends should have been flying back to Newcastle at 10.50am this morning but are still waiting. \u201cThey\u2019ve not got any information on the Newcastle flight,\u201d she said. \u201cATOL have no information but some people are saying it could now be at 9pm.\u201d But Brown remained philosophical: \u201cAt least we had a good week\u2019s holiday. We\u2019re going to get compensation and there are worse places to be stuck.\u201d She said she had heard nothing from Thomas Cook and had been worried that the hotel might try to get guests to pay the bills owed by Thomas Cook. Having heard how guests had been locked in a hotel in Tunisia until they paid up, she and her friends had taken precautions. \u201cWe didn\u2019t check out until the transfer came this morning because we didn\u2019t what happened in Tunisia to happen to us.\u201d Brown also said she has been moved by the grace shown by some Thomas Cook staff. \u201cThe two reps on the coach thanked us all for the holidays we\u2019d taken with Thomas Cook. And then they started to cry.\u201d The opposition Labour Party is urging the government to step in, even at this late stage, to rescue Thomas Cook: Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, says: \u201cThanks to the government\u2019s failure to act, staff employed by Thomas Cook may face redundancy while holiday makers risk being left stranded overseas. \u201cThe government must stop its recklessness and step in to avert this crisis by taking an equity stake\u201d. On the \u201cstranded overseas\u201d point, both the CAA and the Department for Transport insist that holidaymakers will be brought home. Transport secretary Grant Shapps did warn that it won\u2019t be \u201centirely smooth sailing\u201d..... Condor, Thomas Cook\u2019s German airline subsidiary, is seeking financial aid from Berlin to keep it operating. AFP has the details: Underlining that it had been \u201cprofitable for many years,\u201d the airline added that \u201cto prevent liquidity bottlenecks at Condor, it has applied for a state-guaranteed bridging loan\u201d which is being examined in Berlin. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to concentrate on what we do best: flying our guests safely and punctually to their holidays,\u201d said managing director Ralf Teckentrup. Thomas Cook\u2019s German arm told news agency DPA that around 140,000 German tourists are currently on holiday with the travel group and its subsidiaries. Around 21,000 had been scheduled for departure on Monday and Tuesday, the company added. A reminder of happier days: We\u2019d like to hear from people who are currently abroad and have travelled with Thomas Cook. We\u2019re also interested in hearing from workers at the tour company. You can share your experiences in the form here and can also share your stories and photos with the Guardian via WhatsApp by adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Only the Guardian will see your responses and we will include some of them in our ongoing coverage. Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse is also bad news for the companies it worked with across the globe. They face the loss of future business, plus the risk of unpaid bills today. Turkey\u2019s tourism ministry says it will create a loan support package for companies facing financial pain. There are more than 21,000 Thomas Cook customers in Turkey today, it adds (via Reuters). There\u2019s no room for sentiment in the City over Thomas Cook\u2019s demise. Shares in other travel and holiday companies are rallying this morning. TUI has jumped 7% to the top of the FTSE 100. EasyJet has gained 6%. Traders are obviously calculating that Thomas Cook\u2019s rivals can now hoover up its customers, and potentially push their prices up (as there\u2019s one less competitor to worry about). Dame Deirdre Hutton, the chair of the Civil Aviation Authority, has confirmed that all Thomas Cook customers will be brought home at the end of their holiday. He also blamed the company\u2019s failure to embrace modern technology for its collapse: Dame Deirdre told the Today programme: \u201cThomas Cook is operating on brochures whereas everyone else has moved on to barcodes.\u201d \u201cEvery single person will be brought back home at the end of their holiday. Everyone will be brought home free of charge.\u201d She added that it is \u201cdesperately sad to see it [Thomas Cook] go and my heart goes out to the 9,000 people who lost their jobs.\u201d Some confusion exists over whether non-Atol protected passengers - mainly flight only - would be brought home. Although normally passengers who are not ATOL-protected would be asked to find and pay for their own way home, the Department for Transport has said it will assist all impacted passengers abroad. It said: \u201cFor flights back to the UK, it doesn\u2019t matter whether customers are ATOL protected or not, or what their nationality is. Everyone on a Thomas Cook holiday with a return flight to the UK within the two weeks will be brought home.\u201d The rescue flights will only operate for the next two weeks - any passengers abroad with flights home beyond that date will have to arrange their own travel. Back at Palma Airport, more than a dozen staff from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wearing hi-vis vests have arrived to help people get home. But the wait goes on. Our correspondent Sam Jones has the latest: Apart from being a bit annoyed by the absence of anywhere to park his luggage for what promises to be a long wait, John Marszol is reasonably philosophical. He and his partner Donna where due to take the 10.30 flight home to Glasgow, but the flight has now been pushed back to twenty to eight this evening and will land in Manchester. A transfer to Glasgow is then promised.... The couple had decided to take matters into their own hands at 7am this morning and checked out of the hotel and got a taxi to the airport. \u201cWhen I checked this morning, it said the flight was going to leave for Birmingham at 10.30,\u201d said John. \u201cThe ATOL lassie said it\u2019s going to fly into Manchester now and I\u2019ve got no information on the transfer. We need to know. I\u2019d didn\u2019t bring my driving licence so we can\u2019t hire a car at Manchester to drive home.\u201d He said there had been nothing from Thomas Cook - \u201cyou just get directed to the CAA website.\u201d The pair were digging in for a long day at the end of what had been a lovely week away. \u201cThe holiday was great until this,\u201d said John, adding: \u201cAlthough it was too hot for someone from Scotland.\u201d With nowhere to go, the couple\u2019s thoughts had turned to who would feed their three cats - and to holidays to come. As John puts it: \u201cAt least in the future we won\u2019t be able to book with Thomas Cook.\u201d Some travellers face long bus journeys to return to their original destination once their flight lands back in the UK. For example, the CAA says that passengers booked into a Thomas Cook flight from Palma to Gatwick tomorrow at 11am will instead be flown to Manchester then bussed to Gatwick. That\u2019s a likely journey of around four and a half hours - not a great end to anyone\u2019s holiday. There\u2019s more information here. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also told Sky News that the government \u201cshould have intervened\u201d to save Thomas Cook, given the number of jobs at stake and consumers involved. He said that the firm had already once been publicly owned. It would have been best to \u201cstep in, stabilise the situation, and allow some breathing space\u201d to turn operations round and protect jobs and consumers. Here\u2019s some reaction to his comments this morning: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, says Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses should examine their consciences and repay their bonuses. He\u2019s on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme now, arguing that the government should have stepped in following the \u201cmanagement failure\u201d at Thomas Cook. McDonnell says that he would have intervened to help, if he was chancellor, due to the threat to people\u2019s holidays and the 13,000 jobs at risk. Q: But the company wanted a \u00a3250m bailout- isn\u2019t that throwing good money after bad? McDonnell questions whether \u00a3250m would actually needed - the key point is the government should have stepped in to help, with \u201cstrings attached\u201d. Q: Should the company\u2019s bosses repay their bonuses? \u201cToo right\u201d, says McDonnell enthusiastically. If they were bankers, we could claw their bonuses back (through legislation brought in after the financial crisis). They really need to examine their own consciences about how they\u2019ve brought this situation about, he adds firmly. The Civil Aviation Authority tell us it had chartered 40 aircraft and taken seats on other airlines to bring holidaymakers home, from carriers including British Airways and Virgin. The BBC estimates that the CAA will have brought at least 14,000 people home by the end of today. A Thomas Cook customer in Mah\u00f3n, the capital of Menorca, tells us they were due to fly back to Bristol this morning - but the flight was cancelled. But the CAA are on the case - they were at the airport by 7am to help passengers. Our customer has now been been told they will be coming back today in a chartered Titan flight -- six hours late. The CAA are \u201cplaying a blinder\u201d, they say, being very efficient at handling the situation. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has warned that some Thomas Cook customers may struggle to get their money back: For those who\u2019d booked future trips, ATOL and ABTA schemes should mean full refunds, but some, especially those who booked flights only, may be unprotected. Travel insurance won\u2019t help for most, as travel company failure cover is rarely included as standard \u2013 though check your policy or give them a call. \u201cIf you did book without travel industry or insurance protection, the next route is your card provider. Those who paid more than \u00a3100 on a credit card get Section 75 legal protection \u2013 which means the card firm is jointly liable with the retailer, so you can get your money back from it. However this may not work if you booked via an agency, or via certain PayPal transactions, as that break in the direct transactional relationship can stop it working \u2013 we wait to see how widespread that problem will be. \u201cIf that happens, or you paid by debit card, instead ask your bank to do a \u2018chargeback\u2019. This isn\u2019t a legal protection \u2013 it is a Visa, Mastercard and Amex rule where your bank gets your money back from Thomas Cook\u2019s bank as you didn\u2019t receive what you paid for. It should work for most people. Those who paid by other methods such as cheques or cash have very little protection sadly.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones, is at Palma airport in Mallorca. He writes: That most sacred of British stereotypes is much in evidence at Palma airport, where Thomas Cook passengers are queueing for their flights quietly, politely and stoically. ATOL staff in tabards are wielding clipboards are negotiating the fallout from the travel firm\u2019s collapse and fielding questions from worried customers. Although many holiday-makers feared the worst when they woke up this morning, those booked on the 10.35am to Birmingham seem to be in luck. The flight is scheduled to take off on time and passengers are waiting to check in as normal. \u201cIt was all OK until we woke up this morning and found out what had happened,\u201d said Wendy Hiscocks from South Wales. \u201cBut we\u2019d checked in before we got here. It\u2019s been fine: the transfer turned up and so did the rep.\u201d As long as she could get home, she added, things didn\u2019t seem too bad. \u201cWhat can you do? And it such a shame for the poor people who\u2019ve lost their jobs.\u201d A little further along the check-in queue were Mr and Mrs Perrins from Walsall. \u201cThe flight\u2019s at 25 to 11 so we\u2019ve still got a couple of hours to go,\u201d said Mr Perrins. \u201cThey told us what was happening as soon as they knew.\u201d He and his wife were also thinking of the thousands of jobs that look set to go as the travel giant folds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel sorry for them, haven\u2019t you?\u201d he added. Michael and Rebecca O\u2019Donnell, from Birmingham, had also woken up to the bad news. \u201cI looked it up on the website when I woke up but it\u2019s been fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve checked the flight and everything seems normal.\u201d He said he and his wife had followed developments online but hadn\u2019t had any email from Thomas Cook. Other passengers flying back to the UK from Palma face more disruption. The 10.30 to Glasgow will take off five minutes late and land at Birmingham, where people will be offered transfers to Glasgow. The 10.50 to Newcastle not take off until 19.40, and will fly into Manchester. Transfers to Newcastle will be provided. The 11.20 to East Midlands will now leave at 15.20. The 10.40 to Manchester has been delayed until 19.40 Here are some photos from Mallorca Airport, where Civil Aviation Association staff are explaining the situation to Thomas Cook holidaymakers: The Thomas Cook check-in desks at Gatwick Airport in Sussex are closed, with a stark warning that all flights are now cancelled: The airline industry is scrambling to assist with Operation Matterhorn - the huge operation to get Thomas Cook customers home. For example Easyjet says it is providing a plane: We are sorry to see the news about Thomas Cook and appreciate the anxiety that their customers will be facing now. \u201ceasyJet is working with the CAA to provide a fully crewed A320 aircraft to support the repatriation efforts over the coming days. Balpa, the pilots union, is pretty scathing about Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, saying staff have been \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d. Balpa says: \u201cThe hopes of all Thomas Cook employees that their airline could survive has been brutally quashed this morning as they wake up to find they have no job. \u201cWhile detailed plans to repatriate passengers have been carefully put together and Ministers have and will continue to claim the credit for that, the staff have been stabbed in the back without a second\u2019s thought. \u201cDespite continuing to keep Thomas Cook going in recent weeks with dignity and integrity while their own futures were being secretly decided we don\u2019t even know if staff will get a pay cheque this month. It is despicable. Thomas Cook pilots and all staff deserve better than this. \u201cFor pilots, BALPA will be supporting our members through the legal complexities of what Thomas Cook liquidation means for them and doing everything we can to help them find alternative jobs in other airlines.\u201d Adam French, Which? Consumer Rights Expert, has some advice for customers caught up in the Thomas Cook collapse: \u201cHundreds of thousands of holidaymakers affected by the collapse of Thomas Cook will be incredibly worried, especially if they are currently still on holiday and stranded abroad. The good news is that ATOL protection will mean they will be flown back home free of charge. \u201cCustomers who have already paid and booked for an upcoming holiday with the collapsed travel operator should also be entitled to a refund as part of the scheme. \u201cHowever, if you didn\u2019t book as part of a package you might not be ATOL protected but you may be able to claim the cost back through your travel insurance or credit card issuer - it will depend on your circumstances. You can visit which.co.uk for more advice on your rights.\u201d Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse comes four months after it warned that Brexit uncertainty was hurting its business. In May, the company told the City that customers had been postponing their holiday plans, saying: There is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer.\u201d The slump in the value of the pound since the 2016 referendum won\u2019t have helped either, as it makes foreign holidays more expensive. Political science professor Simon Hix says this was a critical factor: Our colleague Rob Davies has written about how Thomas Cook\u2019s lenders pushed it over the edge by demanding an extra \u00a3200m of funding: Just three weeks ago, the tour operator looked to have secured a \u00a3900m rescue package \u2013 half provided by Chinese tourism business Fosun, the rest by a mixture of banks and hedge funds. The debt-for-equity swap would wipe out of \u00a31.7bn of loans, allowing the company to make its interest payments during the barren winter, when less cash comes in because bookings are low. Then, in what one person familiar with the talks described as a bolt from the blue, came a shock demand from its banks, state-owned RBS chief among them. Thomas Cook must find an extra \u00a3200m, they said, or the restructuring could not go ahead. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has tweeted: The union representing Thomas Cook\u2019s high street and office staff have blamed the government for allowing the company to collapse. TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes argues that liquidation could have been avoided -- and could have been cheaper than having to pick up the pieces. Cortes says: Administration need not have happened \u2013 the Government had been given ample opportunity to step in and help Thomas Cook but has instead chosen ideological dogma over saving thousands of jobs. \u201cThat they would rather hang our members out to dry instead of rescuing Thomas Cook is shameful and wrongheaded. \u201cThere remains the question of repatriating 150,000 British holidaymakers and the cost to the public purse of doing so. You don\u2019t have to be a mathematical genius to know it would have been cheaper and more cost effective to save what is a cornerstone of the British high street. \u201cOur union is still urgently seeking meetings with Government to discuss exactly what happens next and will not give up the fight for jobs. But clearly Tory Ministers should hang their heads in shame over their inaction.\u201d The departure boards at UK airports are splattered with red \u201cCancelled\u201d signs this morning, denoting Thomas Cook flights that won\u2019t take off today. Here\u2019s a clip of Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, confirming the \u201cdevastating news\u201d that the official receiver has now taken control of the holiday firm: Thomas Cook\u2019s fate was sealed after its banks demanded an extra \u00a3200m of funding to tide it over the winter period. That proved a stretch too far for the company, which was already trying to raise \u00a3900m through a rescue deal. Those banks included Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 both bailed out by the taxpayer a decade ago (an option denied to Thomas Cook). Those lenders have now issued a statement, claiming they have been \u201cextremely supportive\u201d: \u201cUnfortunately, and notwithstanding the efforts of all stakeholders, the \u00a31.1bn funding requirement to adequately recapitalise Thomas Cook has ultimately proved too significant. The Lenders providing finance facilities to the Group have been extremely supportive stakeholders, including through two periods of financial distress and have stood behind Thomas Cook over the past twelve months, a period where the Group saw cash outflows of about \u00a31bn, maintaining that position over the crucial and busy summer holiday period. \u201cObviously, the Lenders are deeply disappointed that it has not proved possible to rescue Thomas Cook. In partnership with other stakeholders, the Lenders worked tirelessly to examine all options within the timeframe required.\u201d Good morning from London. Why did Thomas Cook fall into insolvency today? The sad truth, according to industry experts, is that it didn\u2019t keep up with changing times. Tim Jeans, the former boss of Monarch Airlines (which collapsed two years ago), told Radio 5 Live that Thomas Cook\u2019s model of \u201cflying people from airports across the UK to concrete hotels by the sea\u201d doesn\u2019t really work any more. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to fly and flop\u201d, Jeans argues. They want experiences instead, but Thomas Cook\u2019s 2019 travel brochures looked like those from 1999. Thomas Cook also owned its own planes, which is handy in high season, but means you have high fixed costs all year round. But clearly plenty of people do still enjoy escaping to, say, Mykonos, Marrakesh or Malta, which is why a huge repatriation effort is now underway to get holidaymakers back home. I\u2019m going to hand over to my colleague Graeme Wearden now. Thanks for following along through the early hours. A few reports have come through that Thomas Cook staff were not notified by the company of the trouble that the company was in. One said he found out the company had gone bust by reading media reports today. Another, whose family member worked for Thomas Cook, said the company had been telling staff up until yesterday that reports of financial distress had been inflated by the press. If you know more, please get in touch: kate.lyons@theguardian.com The UK Civil Aviation Authority announced at about 2am that Thomas Cook Group has ceased trading with immediate effect, with all flights and holidays cancelled. Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive of Thomas Cook, said the tour operator\u2019s collapse was a \u201cmatter of profound regret\u201d as he apologised to the company\u2019s \u201cmillions of customers, and thousands of employees\u201d. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the government had asked it to launch a repatriation programme over the next two weeks, starting on Monday and running to Sunday 6 October, to bring Thomas Cook customers back to the UK. Dozens of charter planes have been brought in from as far afield as Malaysia to assist with the mass airlift. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said all customers currently abroad with Thomas Cook who are booked to return to the UK over the next two weeks will be brought home as close as possible to their booked return date, in \u201cthe biggest peacetime repatriation in UK history\u201d and asked for patience from travellers as the returns were sorted out. On the plane to New York for the UN General Assembly, Boris Johnson said that in the wake of the collapse of the budget airlines Monarch, and now of Thomas Cook, it was time to \u201creflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivised to sort such matters out\u201d. The Civil Aviation Authority has instructed customers who are currently overseas not to travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated website. Thomas Cook customers in the UK yet to travel should not go to the airport as all flights leaving the UK have been cancelled. The CAA has launched a website dedicated to providing information for travellers who are stuck. There is also a phone number for people to call. Overseas number: +44 1753 330 330 and UK freephone: 0300 303 2800 Business secretary Andrea Leadsom said she would write to the Insolvency Service to ask them to \u201cfast-track\u201d their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook going into liquidation. Peter Walker who is travelling with the prime minister to the United Nations General Assembly in New York has filed this report on Boris Johnson\u2019s comments about the Thomas Cook crash: Boris Johnson has promised a comprehensive government response to assist any Thomas Cook customers stranded by the collapse of the firm, and hinted at possible government action against directors of travel firms who oversee bankruptcies. The prime minister said that in the wake of the collapse of the budget airlines Monarch, and now of Thomas Cook, it was time to \u201creflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivised to sort such matters out\u201d. Speaking to reporters on his plane heading to the UN general assembly in New York, Johnson said it did not seem the government could have done more to help, for example agreeing to Thomas Cook\u2019s request for a \u00a3150m bailout. \u201cIt is a very difficult situation, and obviously our thoughts are very much with the customers of Thomas Cook, the holidaymakers, who may now face difficulties getting home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do our level best to get them home. There will be plans ready to deal with that if it is necessary.\u201d On the request for government funding, he said: \u201cClearly, that\u2019s a lot of taxpayers\u2019 money and sets up, as people will appreciate, a moral hazard in the case of future such commercial difficulties that companies face. \u201cI do think that we need to look at ways in which tour operators, one way or another, can protect themselves from such bankruptcies in future. And clearly the systems that we have in place to make sure that companies like Monarch or Thomas Cook don\u2019t in the end come to the taxpayer for help, one way or the other, the state will have to step in to help stranded holidaymakers. \u201cOne\u2019s driven the reflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivised to sort such matters out.\u201d The Civil Aviation Authority website, to which the CAA is directing customers affected by the Thomas Cook collapse, is now working. It\u2019s been glitching since it launched. It offers advice about what to do for those people who are stranded abroad or had flights booked out of the UK through Thomas Cook. Here\u2019s a taste of what they\u2019re advising: Customers already abroad If you are currently abroad and your flight was with Thomas Cook we are providing new flights to return you to the UK. These repatriation flights will only be operating for the next two weeks (until 6 October 2019). After this date you will have to make your own travel arrangements. From a small number of locations, passengers will have to book their own return flights. Customers yet to travel out of the UK We are sorry to inform you that all future holidays and flights booked with Thomas Cook are cancelled as of 23 September 2019. If you are booked on a Thomas Cook Airlines flight, please do not go to your UK airport, as your flight will not be operating. The Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s repatriation programme will not include any outbound flights from the UK. If you choose to book a new flight with another airline out of the UK, you will not be eligible for a repatriation flight. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it has launched Britain\u2019s largest peacetime repatriation to bring home stranded Thomas Cook passengers. The Press Association has looked at some of the key numbers involved in the operation: All of the travel company\u2019s flights have been cancelled - that means the 105 aircraft it operates, according to its website, have been grounded. There are 600,000 Thomas Cook travellers who have been left stuck overseas. More than 150,000 of those are Britons. The airlift is almost twice the size of the repatriation effort required when Monarch went bust in October 2017. In that instance, the CAA put on 567 flights which brought almost 84,000 passengers back to the UK. The final cost of the Monarch operation to taxpayers was about \u00a350m. The Department for Transport would not put a firm figure on how much it would cost this time around but it is understood it could top \u00a3100m. Dozens of charter planes have been brought in from as far afield as Malaysia to assist with the mass airlift. Only holidaymakers with return flights booked within the next two weeks, between Monday and Sunday 6 October, will qualify for a free flight home, as close as possible to their original return date. On Monday 30 September, one week into the repatriation process, the CAA will launch a service which will seek to process all refunds within 60 days of full information being received. Further details will be given at thomascook.caa.co.uk. A lot of sad people who have had to cancel holidays, freaked out people wondering how they will get back from them and people expressing concern for Thomas Cook employees who may be out of work. China\u2019s Fosun Group \u2018disappointed\u2019 it was not able to rescue Thomas Cook from bankruptcy China\u2019s Fosun Group, which had led a last-ditch bid to rescue British travel firm Thomas Cook from bankruptcy, on Monday said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the effort had failed. \u201cFosun is disappointed that Thomas Cook Group has not been able to find a viable solution for its proposed recapitalisation with other affiliates, core lending banks, senior noteholders and additional involved parties,\u201d Fosun said in a statement to AFP. \u201cFosun confirms that its position remained unchanged throughout the process, but unfortunately other factors have changed.\u201d \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathy to all those affected by this outcome.\u201d Thomas Cook had announced last month that Fosun, which was already the biggest shareholder, would inject \u00a3450 million ($560 million) into the business. In return, the Hong Kong-listed conglomerate was to acquire a 75% stake in Thomas Cook\u2019s tour operating division and 25% of its airline unit. Fosun did not say whether it planned further efforts to rescue or acquire Thomas Cook outright. An earlier version of its statement in reaction to the collapse said \u201cFosun will continue to increase investment and cooperation in the UK market.\u201d But it offered no details, and that line was dropped from later amended versions of its statement. Thomas Cook in May revealed that first-half losses widened on a major write-down, caused in part by Brexit uncertainty that delayed summer holiday bookings. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom said she would write to the Insolvency Service to ask them to \u201cfast-track\u201d their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook going into liquidation. The investigation will also consider the conduct of the directors, the Department for Transport said. Leadsom said: \u201cThis will be a hugely worrying time for employees of Thomas Cook, as well as their customers. Government will do all it can to support them. \u201cI will be setting up a cross-government taskforce to monitor local impacts, will write to insurance companies to ask them to process claims quickly, and stand ready to provide assistance and advice. \u201cI will also be writing to the Insolvency Service to ask them to prioritise and fast-track their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook going into liquidation.\u201d Some good news for one reader, who was due to fly back from Orlando on a Thomas Cook-booked flight today. He is still able to fly home today, thanks to Virgin Atlantic. Fingers crossed that there is more good news like this for other travellers. Transport secretary Grant Shapps announced the Government and CAA has hired dozens of charter planes to fly customers home free of charge. In a statement, the Department for Transport (DfT) said all customers currently abroad with Thomas Cook who are booked to return to the UK over the next two weeks will be brought home as close as possible to their booked return date. Thomas Cook package holiday customers will also see the cost of their accommodation covered by the Government, through the Air Travel Trust Fund or Atol scheme, the DfT said. Shapps said: \u201cThomas Cook\u2019s collapse is very sad news for staff and holidaymakers. The Government and UK CAA is working round the clock to help people. \u201cOur contingency planning has helped acquire planes from across the world - some from as far away as Malaysia - and we have put hundreds of people in call centres and at airports. \u201cBut the task is enormous, the biggest peacetime repatriation in UK history. So there are bound to be problems and delays. \u201cPlease try to be understanding with the staff who are trying to assist in what is likely to be a very difficult time for them as well.\u201d Full statement from the Civil Aviation Authority: Thomas Cook Group, including the UK tour operator and airline, has ceased trading with immediate effect. All Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and holidays, have now been cancelled. There are currently more than 150,000 Thomas Cook customers abroad, almost twice the number that were repatriated following the failure of Monarch. We know that a company with such long-standing history ceasing trading will be very distressing for its customers and employees and our thoughts are with everyone affected by this news. The Government has asked the UK Civil Aviation Authority to launch a repatriation programme over the next two weeks, from Monday 23 September to Sunday 6 October, to bring Thomas Cook customers back to the UK. Due to the unprecedented number of UK customers currently overseas who are affected by the situation, the Civil Aviation Authority has secured a fleet of aircraft from around the world to bring passengers back to the UK with return flights. Passengers in a small number of destinations may return on alternative commercial flights, rather than directly through the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s flying programme. Details and advice for these passengers are available on the dedicated website. The Civil Aviation Authority has launched a special website, thomascook.caa.co.uk, where affected customers can find details and information on repatriation flights, as well as advice on accommodation for both ATOL and non-ATOL customers. Due to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the Civil Aviation Authority will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates. This will apply to both ATOL protected passengers and those who are not protected. Customers currently overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated website. Thomas Cook customers in the UK yet to travel should not go to the airport as all flights leaving the UK have been cancelled. ATOL Protected passengers with future bookings are entitled to a full refund for their cancelled holiday. Passengers currently overseas may also make claims for the cost of replacing ATOL protected parts of their trip, or for out of pocket expenses as a result of delayed flights home. The Civil Aviation Authority will be launching a service to manage all refunds by Monday 30 September, once the flying operation has progressed. This refunds service will seek to process all refunds within 60 days of full information being received. Further information will be available on our dedicated website in the coming days, but please do not submit anything to the Civil Aviation Authority in the meantime as the organisation continues to focus on the repatriation flying programme to return more than 150,000 passengers to the UK. More information will follow on how to make a claim. Richard Moriarty, Chief Executive of the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: \u201cNews of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse is deeply saddening for the company\u2019s employees and customers, and we appreciate that more than 150,000 people currently abroad will be anxious about how they will now return to the UK. \u201cThe government has asked us to support Thomas Cook customers on what is the UK\u2019s largest ever peacetime repatriation. \u201cWe have launched, at very short notice, what is effectively one of the UK\u2019s largest airlines, involving a fleet of aircraft secured from around the world. The nature and scale of the operation means that unfortunately some disruption will be inevitable. We ask customers to bear with us as we work around the clock to bring them home. \u201cWe urge anyone affected by this news to check our dedicated website, thomascook.caa.co.uk, for advice and information.\u201d The UK Civil Aviation Authority will be providing regular updates as our flying programme develops. Quite a few people tweeting in or messaging me to ask if they should still go to the airport for flights booked through Thomas Cook today. The answer is no. All Thomas Cook flights are cancelled, British airports are starting to tweet telling people to stay home if their flight was booked through the company. And this is from the Civil Aviation Authority: Customers currently overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated website [which at time of writing was still down and showing an error message, but which the CAA says will work soon, keep refreshing]. Thomas Cook customers in the UK yet to travel should not go to the airport as all flights leaving the UK have been cancelled. https://twitter.com/STN_Airport/status/1175948298038972416?s=20 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the government had asked it to launch a repatriation programme over the next two weeks, starting on Monday and running to Sunday 6 October, to bring Thomas Cook customers back to the UK. The CAA statement said: \u201cDue to the unprecedented number of UK customers currently overseas who are affected by the situation, the Civil Aviation Authority has secured a fleet of aircraft from around the world to bring passengers back to the UK with return flights. \u201cPassengers in a small number of destinations may return on alternative commercial flights, rather than directly through the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s flying programme.

This will apply to both Atol protected passengers and those who are not protected. \u201cCustomers currently overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated website. \u201cThomas Cook customers in the UK yet to travel should not go to the airport as all flights leaving the UK have been cancelled.\u201d Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive of Thomas Cook, said the tour operator\u2019s collapse was a \u201cmatter of profound regret\u201d as he apologised to the company\u2019s \u201cmillions of customers, and thousands of employees\u201d. The CAA\u2019s website dedicated to providing information for travellers who are stuck keeps crashing, but the CAA says just to keep refreshing and it should be fixed shortly. There is also a phone number for people to call. Overseas number: +44 1753 330 330 UK freephone: 0300 303 2800 I\u2019ve had a few people tweet in with questions (please get in touch if you\u2019re affected, share your story, pics of your situation, questions etc - kate.lyons@theguardian.com or on Twitter). We have put together an article addressing some of these questions. There is more information in the full article, but here are some answers to the most common questions I\u2019ve received \u2013 about how to get home and what happens to already-booked holidays. If you are abroad on a Thomas Cook holiday, will you be flown back home? Yes, according to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who told the BBC that contingency planning was in place to make sure no-one would be stranded. The repatriation plan, which has been codenamed Operation Matterhorn, will involve planes chartered from other airlines including British Airways and easyJet. The operation is likely to be a mammoth challenge for the Civil Aviation Authority, on a scale significantly larger than the last major collapse, when Monarch Airlines was grounded in October 2017. The initial advice is likely to be that holidaymakers should not make their way to the airport until notified, as flights are unlikely to be available immediately. Be prepared for possible delays, and the risk that you may be flown back to a different UK airport to the one you took off from, then bussed to your initial departure point. However, the good news is that the Monarch rescue went relatively smoothly. Over the course of two weeks in October 2017 the CAA chartered 560 flights from 24 different airlines, and 98% of Monarch passengers were flown home on the same day they were originally booked to return. You have a booking with Thomas Cook for a holiday next week. What happens to it? It\u2019s very likely you won\u2019t be jetting off to the sun, but you will get the money back that you paid for the Thomas Cook holiday. The CAA will set out how to make a claim for a refund \u2013 go to caa.co.uk/atol-protection/ In some circumstances, Atol may appoint what it calls a \u201cfulfilment partner\u201d to provide the holiday instead, although this is more likely for holidays booked further in advance. Are you covered if you have bought a flight-only deal on Thomas Cook Airlines? Unlikely. Atol was set up to protect holidaymakers who buy package deals, not people putting together holidays on their own over the internet. But there can be some exceptions, such as if the passenger bought the ticket through an Atol licenced travel agent. However, if you booked directly with the airline it is unlikely you will be covered. When XL crashed in 2008, the CAA said flight-only customers were at the back of the queue, and that while it would make efforts to organise cost-only seats, it would not offer any guarantees. \u201cThomas Cook UK Plc and associated UK entities have entered Compulsory Liquidation and are now under the control of the Official Receiver,\u201d says Thomas Cook\u2019s website. \u201cThe UK business has ceased trading with immediate effect and all future flights and holidays are cancelled.\u201d The UK Civil Aviation Authority has announced that Thomas Cook Group has ceased trading with immediate effect, with all flights and holidays cancelled. Hello to you wherever you are around the world, especially if you are stuck there because of Thomas Cook\u2019s insolvency. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Thomas Cook collapse, we will bring you news and reaction as it comes in. Thomas Cook has gone into administration leaving 150,000 UK travellers stranded across the world and putting 9,000 British jobs at risk. The announcement comes after talks throughout Sunday aimed at saving the world\u2019s oldest holiday company, that failed to solve the crisis. The collapse of Thomas Cook has left holidaymakers stuck around the world, and will prompt the UK\u2019s largest-ever peacetime repatriation, codenamed Operation Matterhorn. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government had contingency plans in place for passengers and sought to reassure holidaymakers that they would not end up stuck overseas. The company had appealed to ministers for a bailout but Raab said the government did not \u201csystemically step in\u201d unless it was in the national interest. It is understood that airlines including British Airways and easyJet will be involved in the airlift for holidaymakers using Thomas Cook, whose destinations range from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean. Are you affected by the Thomas Cook collapse? Get in touch in the comments of the blog, via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com) or on Twitter to tell me what\u2019s going on for you. I\u2019ll do my best to find answers for your questions and will be sharing people\u2019s experiences on the blog.",

      "bodyText": "The UK has moved to douse claims that it was snubbing a major Franco-German initiative on multilateralism announcing it would after all send a minister to the launch of An Alliance for Multilateralism, due to be attended by as many as 40 ministers. Following diplomatic claims that Downing Street was distancing itself from the Franco-German plan by not sending a high level representative to the launch in New York on Thursday, the foreign office announced late on Monday that Lord Ahmad would now attend. Some European diplomats claimed that Britain had been distancing itself from an event fearing it might be construed as an implicit rebuke to Donald Trump\u2019s advocacy of national sovereignty But Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cWe want to do more, not less, after Brexit to defend the rules based system and we intend to work with allies around the world - including our European friends - to achieve this. We welcome this French effort to increase international co-operation on pressing issues such as climate change and education and Lord Ahmad will represent the UK at the event.\u201d Earlier western diplomats said the UK had not put forward a minister to attend the event, with discussions continuing about whether Britain would back some of the initiatives linked to the event. The initial snub was seen as a fresh sign of how Brexit is shifting British foreign policy. The alliance, due to be launched by the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, and the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, is intended to act as a bulwark against what Le Drian has described as \u201cthe wilding of the world\u201d and the abandonment of the rules-based order set up after 1945. The initiative, in the planning for six months, has inevitably been seen as a thinly veiled rebuke to the increasingly vocal advocates of national sovereignty such as Donald Trump. The alliance is regarded by France and Germany as its most important joint diplomatic response to nationalism. In the past in debates between advocates of national sovereignty and multilateralism, the UK has always sided with the multilateralists. Countries that have signed up to the agreement, according to Le Drian, include France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Singapore, Ghana and others. Le Drian made no mention of the UK. He said: \u201cThe symptoms of a true wilding of the world accumulates, putting in peril the multilateral edifice which we collectively developed, as we learned the lessons of two great world wars.\u201d The aim he said \u201cwas to give a voice to the immense majority of countries that believe in the efficiency of international cooperation\u201d. Calling the alliance an ambitious humanist project for the 21st century designed \u201cto fight those that are destroying the international order\u201d, Le Drian said the multilateral structures built after the second world war did not threaten national sovereignty. Instead, he said such structures were \u201ca collective guarantee and protection against the law of the strongest, including basic humanitarian law that protects civilians in time of war. Multilateralism is both a method and a goal. In a word multilateralism is humanism.\u201d Confirming the British ministerial absence from the launch on Thursday \u2013 before the position was reversed \u2013 a diplomatic source said the alliance was never intended to be a membership group with formal participation but instead an organisation for cooperation. He said the UK supported one of the six initiatives, which are headed: call for trust and security in cyberspace, international partnership for information and democracy, joint position of the group of friends on climate and security, education; equality at the centre initiative and finally, 11 principles on lethal autonomous weapons systems. The move came in the wake of the US president cutting funding for the United Nations, withdrawing from the UN human rights council, Unesco and the Paris climate agreement. Le Drian and Maas stressed their initiative was not directed against the US, and Maas added that he would be happy to see the US join the effort. Maas claimed multilateralism was under threat, adding that \u201call of those who want to join such an initiative [should] also declare themselves to be multilateralists. In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\u2019re on. \u201cWhoever wants to join us can join us \u2013 it is against nobody,\u201d said Mass.

      "bodyText": "More than four fifths of the world\u2019s largest companies are unlikely to meet the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement by 2050, according to fresh analysis of their climate disclosures. A study of almost 3,000 publicly listed companies found that just 18% have disclosed plans that are aligned with goals to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels by the middle of the century. The report covers companies across the global economy and was undertaken by investment data provider Arabesque S-Ray which assigned each company a temperature score based on its publicly disclosed plans. The companies are scored based on their publicly disclosed emissions-intensity today and scientifically accredited plans to reduce their emissions in future. The analysts found more than a third of the world\u2019s top 200 companies still do not disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, despite rising concern that urgent action is needed to avert dangerous levels of global heating. Andreas Feiner, chief executive of Arabesque S-Ray, said companies \u201cmay appear to be taking steps to reduce their impact on climate change\u201d, but many are choosing to keep the full scale of their emissions under wraps to avoid losing investment. Arabesque\u2019s temperature scores should help make investment more transparent by assigning a 3C increase to companies that fail to disclose their climate emissions, he said. About half of 2,900 companies included in the study have a near-term score that aligns with the Paris Climate target to keep global temperature rise at below 1.5C by 2030. However, these efforts will not be enough to keep a lid on temperatures in the longer term. The analysis shows only a fifth of these companies will remain on track by 2050 and more than a quarter are likely to push temperatures up by at least 2.7C. This trend is more pronounced in the world\u2019s 200 largest listed companies. Almost two-thirds of the G20are expected to be on track to limit global heating to 1.5C by 2030, but \u2013 without drastic steps to reduce emissions \u2013 this number will plummet to 18% by 2050. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change, said the temperature score report \u201chas the potential to be a major force for change\u201d. The scores were published for the first time on Tuesday before the publication of a report from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report is expected to say that without urgent action, humanity faces unprecedented risks from fast-rising sea levels, threatening coastal cities and causing the displacement of hundreds of millions. Figueres said: \u201cWe have a small but certain window of opportunity to make all the necessary efforts to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C, and thereby contribute to a safer, more productive, more socially inclusive and prosperous world.\u201d",

A letter from the admiralty to the security services from 1956 stated she had \u201calleged that her husband was divulging secret information to people who ought not to get it\u201d. However, it added: \u201cIt is considered not impossible that the whole of these allegations may be nothing more than outpourings of a jealous and disgruntled wife.\u201d In March 1961, Martin Furnival Jones, who four years later would become the MI5 director general, wrote: \u201cIt is clear that we ought to have carried out some investigation in 1956. \u201cIf we had done so there is a fair chance that we would have unearthed Houghton\u2019s espionage and the probability is that we would have discovered that he was being controlled as a spy by a member of the Soviet embassy. \u201cWe might also have hit upon Miss Gee. If we had done so we should have stopped a leakage of information from the admiralty some four years earlier.\u201d The files record that Houghton beat his wife \u2013 they separated in 1955 and later divorced \u2013 and even tried to kill her by pushing her off a cliff, only to be interrupted by passersby. When they returned home after the incident, she said he threw gin in her face and told her: \u201cI\u2019ve got to get rid of you, you know too much.\u201d Among the other allegations detailed in the documents, were that her husband had documents marked \u201ctop secret\u201d relating to \u201cunderwater detection equipment and torpedoes\u201d, would return from trips to London with bundles of notes, that he showed her a piece of chalk he said was to mark where the money would be left, that he brought Poles back to the flat \u2013 refusing to say who they were \u2013 and that he told her how he employed a folded newspaper as a \u201crecognition signal\u201d. The papers, published on Tuesday, show that after the ring was exposed, the admiralty and MI5 worried about Houghton\u2019s ex-wife speaking to the press. Houghton, then aged 56, and Gee, 47, were imprisoned for 15 years each in 1961 but were released in 1970 and married the following year. Gee always maintained that she acted only out of love. Redacted letters she sent to Houghton contained in the newly released files illustrate her affection for him. \u201cBunty\u201d, as she signed her letters, began each one \u201cMy Darling Harry\u201d and, in November 1962, she wrote that \u201cthe short time I spent with you was the happiest time of my life\u201d. In one letter in 1962 she berated Houghton\u2019s lack of \u201cguts\u201d and two years later rejected his suggestion they cooperate with the authorities, saying \u201cunder no circumstances would I do any kind of deal with them\u201d. When the authorities arranged a visit by Houghton to see her while they were both still in prison, a transcript showed that Gee, who maintained her innocence, nevertheless warned him: \u201cDon\u2019t speak to them in any way. I\u2019d be back again doing another sentence.\u201d",

Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1176254825543163904?s=20\">said in a tweet</a> that European partners have failed to fulfil their commitments under a 2015 nuclear pact.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/how-did-attack-breach-saudi-defences-and-what-will-happen-next\">How did oil attack breach Saudi defences and what will happen next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>France has sent investigators to examine the weapons fragments collected at the site of the attacks.

Iran was and is behaving disruptively in the region.\u201d \u201cIf it was a bad deal \u2013 and I\u2019m willing to accept that, it had many, many defects \u2013 then let\u2019s do a better deal. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal and one guy who understands how to get a difficult partner like Iran over the line and that is the president of the United States.\u201d Johnson described Trump as a \u201cvery, very brilliant negotiator\u201d who could produce a \u201cTrump deal\u201d. On the prospect of a US military response to airstrikes against Saudi oil installations on 14 September, Johnson replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I think will necessarily help the situation.\u201d Johnson\u2019s remarks came as the UK, France and Germany declared they were convinced that Iran was responsible for the attacks and called on Tehran to negotiate over its role in the Middle East and its development of missiles as well as its nuclear programme. In a joint statement at the UN general assembly on Monday, the three European governments supported the US and Saudi claim that Iran had carried out the missile and drone attack, but added they maintained support for the JCPOA. \u201cIt is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,\u201d the statement said following a meeting between Johnson, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The statement said that the attack raised the risk of a major new conflict, which was of concern to the whole world. It underlined the importance of collective security and multilateral action. The statement also restated the European nations\u2019 commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal. Asked whether Johnson\u2019s undertaking in the European statement clashed with his remarks on the US evening news, a UK official insisted there was a coherent message. \u201cWhat this is about is achieving compliance, and we\u2019re open to various ways of achieving that,\u201d he said. \u201cOur commitment is to working with all of our partners to find solutions to bring Iran into compliance. In his interview I think he was clear he wants to work with all our partners.\u201d The European agreement called for Iran to return to the limits on its nuclear programme imposed by that agreement, which Tehran has begun to ignore more than a year after the US withdrew from the deal. But the statement said Iran would now have to go further, arguing \u201cthe time has come for Iran to accept a long-term negotiation framework for its nuclear program, as well as regional security issues, which include its missile programs,\u201d the statement said. Iran has denied responsibility, insisting the strikes were launched from Yemen by their Houthi allies. On Monday night Iran ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with major powers. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that European partners have failed to fulfil their commitments under a 2015 nuclear pact. France has sent investigators to examine the weapons fragments collected at the site of the attacks. The UN has also sent an investigative team, which has yet to deliver a report. Iran has said it will not necessarily accept the results of that report, calling into question the impartiality of the UN team. The European statement comes as the US and Iran are poised to clash at the UN general assembly. Donald Trump is due to address the assembly on Tuesday, and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has already arrived in New York, will speak the next day. Both are expected to blame the other for the worsening instability in the Gulf.",

Green also claimed \u00a380,000-a-year to cover her hotel bills at the five-star Brown\u2019s hotel in London, where she lived during the week. Peter Fankhauser, who was in charge when the company collapsed, was handed \u00a38.3m, including \u00a34.3m in bonuses. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell called on Thomas Cook bosses to \u201cexamine their consciences\u201d, while the party\u2019s shadow minister of consumer affairs, Gill Furniss, called on the bosses to hand back their bonuses. Meanwhile, a group of international hedge funds who bet against Thomas Cook have made big profits from its collapse. Nearly 11% of the travel company\u2019s shares were \u2018shorted\u2019 ahead of its collapse. Short-sellers try to profit from firms they believe are in trouble.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has seen off an attempt by grassroots activists to force Labour to adopt an out-and-out remain position before a general election. Amid chaotic scenes at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, delegates rejected a motion, hammered out in a late-night meeting on Sunday, that would have seen Labour pledge to campaign for remain. Corbyn has made clear that he would prefer to defer the decision about which side Labour will take in a referendum, until after a general election. He said on Sunday, \u201cwe would put both views and say look, this is the best deal we could get; this is the remain and hopefully reform option. These are the choices before you.\u201d His approach, as set out in a statement from the national executive committee (NEC), was agreed on the conference floor with a show of hands as \u201ccomposite 13\u201d, calling for a remain stance, was defeated. A string of speakers throughout the debate at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton urged their colleagues to fall in behind Corbyn\u2019s stance. With just months, or perhaps even weeks to go before a general election, there were fears that a show of disunity would harm the Labour leadership. When the remain motion fell after a show of hands, many stood and cheered, and broke into a chorus of \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. The chair, Wendy Nichols, initially appeared to say the motion had been carried but then said it had been lost, after a conversation with Labour general secretary Jennie Formby, who was sitting alongside her on the conference stage. Nichols then rejected calls for a full card-vote, which would have led to a more forensic count of delegates\u2019 votes. Labour\u2019s conference has been rocked by a series of rows, which kicked off on Friday night with a botched bid to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post of deputy leader. Watson will give his own speech on Tuesday. According to extracts released in advance, he will urge colleagues to \u201cdraw a line under\u201d the controversy. \u201cTurning in on ourselves is a gift to the Tories. I didn\u2019t choose the row going into this vital week for our party and our country, I didn\u2019t want it, I didn\u2019t seek it and I regret it. It was damaging, divisive and unnecessary. Unfortunately we cannot pretend it didn\u2019t happen. But let us now draw a line under it.\u201d He will urge his party to look to the future, and take on Boris Johnson and the Conservatives in the coming election. \u201cNow, of all times, we cannot let the Tories escape scrutiny. Labour must be together. This is a time to keep our gaze high. To remember who we are, and what we believe, and what we\u2019re trying to achieve. Social justice, equality and opportunity for everyone in our country. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the result of Monday\u2019s vote showed that Corbyn still commands the loyalty of grassroots members. \u201cThe party is determined to unite behind its leader,\u201d she said. Frontbenchers including Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have called for their party to declare its allegiance before a general election. Lewis said after Monday\u2019s votes, \u201cI think there will be huge disappointment amongst activists, members and many voters who were looking for a definitive outcome at this conference. But we know that the vast majority of MPs, the vast majority of the shadow cabinet, the Scottish party and the Welsh party will be campaigning for remain.\u201d However, Labour strategists feared adopting an out-and-out remain position in advance of a general election would jeopardise their chances of holding on to scores of leave constituencies. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, whose speech wound up the debate, did not explicitly call on Labour members to support the remain motion. \u201cWe need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured. Or whether they wouldn\u2019t rather remain in the EU. The people must have the final say. \u201cA referendum in which remain should, and will, be on the ballot paper, along with the best leave deal that can be secured. We owe it to those who want to leave to secure that leave deal and put it to them in a referendum. Starmer was at the late-night meeting on Sunday that resulted in two motions being drafted. Only the one which closely echoed the NEC\u2019s statement was passed. Speaking afterwards, Starmer told a fringe meeting that he had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the idea of Corbyn staying neutral in an election and argued that the Labour membership was so overwhelmingly pro-remain that it\u2019s \u201cobvious the way this is going to end up\u201d. Earlier, Momentum founder Jon Lansman had urged members to vote with their conscience, complaining that the NEC, of which he is a member, had not had the opportunity to scrutinise the wording of the statement properly. \u201cThere was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership,\u201d he said. Disappointed remain campaigners pointed out that Labour in Wales and Scotland has already adopted an anti-Brexit stance \u2013 and key members of the frontbench are on their side. Michael Chessum, of anti-Brexit campaign group Another Europe is Possible, said, \u201ca fudge is not a unity position. It is deeply divisive among members, and risks losing a large chunk of our voter base.\u201d \u201cThis vote was set up as a loyalty test, but those grassroots activists who ran the campaign \u2013 Momentum activists, people who have fought for the left in Labour for years, know this is a nonsense. We have come so far in pushing Labour\u2019s position towards a public vote, and while we might all be disappointed by this outcome, we must now prepare for the election. If Labour loses, the consequences will be dire.\u201d Some exasperated remainers claimed the conference hall had been packed by Momentum, in order to ensure the vote was won. But a shadow minister close to Corbyn said members had put their loyalty to the leader first, saying: \u201cThis is Jeremy\u2019s party.\u201d Several senior Labour figures responded to the vote by suggesting they would make clear to voters that they will campaign for remain, whatever the party\u2019s formal position at a general election. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said, \u201cI do not believe this decision reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members.\u201d Other opposition parties immediately seized on Labour\u2019s decision to continue to try to appeal to both leavers and remainers in a general election. Stephen Gethins, the Scottish National Party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said, \u201cJeremy Corbyn is stuck firmly on the fence, refusing to come down and today\u2019s votes show the rest of the Labour party is happy to stay there. This is a real abdication of leadership. \u201cIt beggars belief that more than three years after the EU referendum, and knowing the damage Brexit will do, Labour is still arguing over its position.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has refused to rule out suspending parliament again if the supreme court rules on Tuesday that he abused his powers as prime minister in doing so earlier this month. The British prime minister, who is in New York for a UN summit, also indicated he would not feel obliged to resign if the justices rule he misled the Queen in his reasons for suspending parliament. Asked if he felt a verdict going against him would make his position untenable, Johnson said: \u201cNo. I think the reasons for wanting a Queen\u2019s speech are extremely good.\u201d Speaking to reporters, Johnson also categorically ruled out any sort of deal with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party in the likely imminent election, saying the Conservatives would contest every seat. The supreme court judgment, which could have a huge impact not just on Johnson\u2019s future but also the wider ability of the courts to take a view in political decisions made by government, is due to be announced at 10.30am, following last week\u2019s hearing. The panel of 11 judges were tasked with hearing appeals from two separate legal challenges to Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament \u2013 the technical term for gaps in parliamentary sessions which do not involve dissolution before an election \u2013 for five weeks from 9 September. The move outraged many MPs, who said it was an attempt to muzzle them at a crucial time in Brexit negotiations. A case brought by the campaigner Gina Miller at the high court in London was rejected. However, a case in Scotland brought by a cross-party group of MPs and peers won a ruling that the decision was unlawful because it was \u201cmotivated by the improper purpose of stymieing parliament\u201d. Johnson has repeatedly insisted that the prorogation was purely technical, allowing a pause in Commons proceedings so a new set of planned legislation could be announced in a Queen\u2019s speech. Johnson said: \u201cActually, when it comes to parliamentary scrutiny, what are we losing? Four or five days of parliamentary scrutiny when parliament has had three years to discuss the issue, and will be able to come back and discuss Brexit after the European council on 17 and 18 October.\u201d Asked if it would be a resignation matter if he lost the case, Johnson said: \u201cI will wait and see what the justices decide, but as I have said before, I believe that the reasons for wanting a Queen\u2019s speech are very good indeed.\u201d The PM declined to rule out prorogation again before the current Brexit deadline of 31 October if the first suspension was struck down, saying only: \u201cI am saying that parliament will have bags of time to scrutinise the deal that I hope we\u2019ll be able to do.\u201d At the supreme court hearing, Miller\u2019s barrister, Lord Pannick, argued that if the court ruled in her favour but declined to end the suspension, it would be possible for the Speakers of the Commons and Lords to reassemble parliament themselves. \ufeffMeanwhile on Monday, the head of the Bar Council condemned unidentified \u201cNumber 10\u201d sources who were quoted in the weekend papers as warning the judiciary about taking sides over Brexit. Richard Atkins QC, chair of the organisation that represents barristers in England and Wales, also criticised death threats sent to one of the litigants in the prorogation case whose home address was revealed on Twitter. \u201cIt is a low point in the history of our nation when a faceless \u2018No 10 source\u2019 refers to \u2018remainiac lawyers\u2019 and issues threats to the judiciary about its constitutional role suggesting that judges take sides,\u201d said Atkins. \u201cThe rule of law and the independence of the judiciary are fundamental pillars of our democracy. Judges do not take sides as the Downing Street source suggests, but apply the law \u2018without fear or favour\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has praised Donald Trump\u2019s political priorities in response to a question about whether he would endorse the president to win the US election in 2020. Given his many expressions of alignment with the Trump administration since his American visit began last Friday, Morrison was asked on Monday during a press conference in Chicago whether he was prepared to endorse the president\u2019s bid for re-election. Trump is already in full campaign mode as the Democrats continue to deliberate over who their presidential candidate will be. The Australian prime minister attended a Trump rally in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on Sunday, which adjoined the opening of a new paper plant in the town owned by the Australian box billionaire, Anthony Pratt. As part of the formalities, the two leaders shared a stage, and traded compliments, in front of an audience of ebullient Trump supporters. With regard to a Trump endorsement, Morrison said it was not the job of visiting foreign leaders to \u201cinvolve themselves in domestic politics, but as you can see we do share a lot of the same views\u201d. In what sounded like an endorsement without an endorsement, Morrison said: \u201cWe believe people should keep more of what they earn, we do think the best form of welfare is a job, we do think you can stimulate and ensure your small business entrepreneurs like we were seeing this morning, it was great to see so many there as part of that lab, out there and creating jobs, then that\u2019s the way you can pay for hospitals, pay for schools, ensure that the aspirations and the standard of living that your people look forward to \u2013 that\u2019s how it\u2019s achieved.\u201d Morrison dropped by a hub for tech entrepreneurs in Chicago after delivering a major foreign policy speech early on Monday at the city\u2019s institute for foreign relations. The Australian prime minister noted Trump enjoyed \u201ctremendous support\u201d for his program as president \u201cand we saw that on display as we made our way to the Pratt plant\u201d.

I know Kelly Smith has been to these kind of events before and in the future we\u2019re going to have more and more England players, I hope so anyway.\u201d The England manager, Phil Neville, agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cJill Scott, Steph Houghton, Ellen White, they deserve to be at awards of this type after a fantastic World Cup and we\u2019ve got players at the top of the game.\u201d On her manager\u2019s belief that she should lift the trophy, Bronze said: \u201cI can imagine. I know what he\u2019s like, I\u2019m happy to be here and I\u2019m happy to be in the top three after such an up-and-down season. A good season with Lyon, we won a lot, and then the World Cup was heartbreaking but I think that\u2019s why the other two had more of a chance.\u201d Jill Ellis collected the women\u2019s coach of the year award following her second successive World Cup-winning campaign with the US women\u2019s national team. The 53-year-old has announced she is stepping aside to take an ambassador role with US Soccer and Neville was full of praise for his semi-final opponent: \u201cWhen you win a World Cup, I think you should win the top award and I\u2019m glad everyone has voted for her like I did.\u201d Ellis said, on collecting her award: \u201cWhat a ride. I want to thank Phil Neville and Sarina Wiegman for making my job hard. The World Cup really was a showcase. I think the world fell in love with our game.\u201d The former Arsenal goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, who joined the Spanish champions, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, after her World Cup heroics for the Netherlands, collected the inaugural women\u2019s goalkeeper of the year award.",

As part of the Coalition\u2019s revived \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d welfare agenda, the government has introduced legislation to expand the card to Cape York and the NT, where it will replace the basics card, and extend existing sites.

The proposal, put forward by WaterNSW, echoes the plan for turning rivers inland first mooted by John Bradfield, the engineer who designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, in 1938. He was unable to convince government of its merits before he died in 1943. But the idea appears to have new currency. The NSW proposals are revealed in a freedom of information request made by the Guardian.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 24 September. Top stories Greta Thunberg has excoriated world leaders for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people through their inertia over the climate crisis at a United Nations summit that failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating. In a stinging speech on Monday, the teenage Swedish climate activist told governments that \u201cyou are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.\u201d Days after millions of young people took to the streets worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered for the annual United Nations general assembly aiming to inject fresh momentum into efforts to curb carbon emissions. While Scott Morrison did not attend the summit, he issued a challenge to China while in Chicago, saying that it was a \u201cnewly developed\u201d rather than a developing economy, and argued that status conferred developed-world obligations on the Chinese leadership in terms of action on the climate crisis. Labor will oppose a government push to expand the controversial cashless welfare card and extend existing trial sites, saying it will only support income management if the scheme is made voluntary. Labor\u2019s hardening opposition to the card, which it initially supported in trial communities, comes as the Northern Territory\u2019s peak body for Aboriginal organisations likened the \u201cunwarranted haste\u201d of the cashless debit card push in the territory to the \u201cdisastrous and ill-advised imposition\u201d of the 2007 intervention. As part of the Coalition\u2019s revived \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d welfare agenda, the government has introduced legislation to expand the card to Cape York and the NT, where it will replace the basics card, and extend existing sites. Without an extension being granted by parliament, the existing trial sites are due to expire in June next year. New South Wales has been secretly exploring long-dismissed plan to turn coastal rivers inland, to provide more water for irrigators and towns in the west of the state. The proposal, put forward by WaterNSW, echoes the plan for turning rivers inland first mooted by John Bradfield, the engineer who designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, in 1938. He was unable to convince government of its merits before he died in 1943. But the idea appears to have new currency. The NSW proposals are revealed in a freedom of information request made by the Guardian. The documents show significant work has been done on at least four projects involving pumping water from coastal rivers over the Great Dividing Range to replenish western NSW rivers, which are in the grip of a drought. World Jeremy Corbyn has seen off an attempt by grassroots activists to force UK Labour to adopt a remain position ahead of a general election. Amid chaotic scenes at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, delegates rejected a composite motion that would have seen Labour pledge to campaign for remain. Meanwhile EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has described Boris Johnson\u2019s solution for replacing the Irish backstop as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Benjamin Netanyahu has come out narrowly ahead of Benny Gantz during consultations on who should lead the next Israeli government, although it remained unclear if he would be chosen to form a coalition. Donald Trump has attempted to shrug off renewed demands for his impeachment over the allegation he tried to pressure a foreign government to hurt his leading rival, Joe Biden, in next year\u2019s presidential election. Narendra Modi defended his government\u2019s actions in Kashmir and accused Pakistan of harbouring terrorists during a packed rally in Texas attended by US president Donald Trump. Two men, including a photojournalist, have been shot and injured by a Haitian senator, who opened fire outside the country\u2019s parliament, amid chaotic scenes as the government attempted to confirm the appointment of a new prime minister. Opinion and analysis Those asking if Australia needs a recession are either too young to recall or have forgotten, writes Greg Jericho. Not only do recessions wreck the economy and lives; they utterly change society. \u201cOne way to look at this is to observe the change that recessions have on the work of men in their 40s \u2013 that age when usually they have children and are nearing the peak of their earning ability. The 1982 and 1990s recessions and the GFC saw falls in the percentage of men in their 40s in employment from peaks that have never again been reached.\u201d UK Labour elite won a battle, but it might have just lost the war, writes John Crace. \u201cJeremy had definitely won. He had at least 110% of the vote. It had been the most democratic vote in the history of all democratic votes. The confusion had been that all the remainers couldn\u2019t see all the people who had voted for Jeremy who had been standing just outside the hall. Labour had clutched defeat from the jaws of ambiguity. Just when the Tories were on their knees, Labour had proved itself unwilling to subject itself to scrutiny. The voice of the majority of its members ignored. Not even allowed a proper count. Party policy was now \u2018make me something, but I\u2019ve no idea what\u2019.\u201d Sport Kamaishi is set to play an emotional role in Japan\u2019s World Cup story, writes Andy Bull. \u201cThere used to be a telephone box in the middle of the Kamaishi stadium. Nodoka Kikuchi reckons it was somewhere right around the halfway line. She\u2019d know. She was the last person to ever use it.\u201d Russia faces the prospect of being banned from next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo, after the World Anti-Doping Agency gave it three weeks to explain apparent inconsistencies in data from its Moscow laboratory. Thinking time: the chicken curtain \u201cUrban planners and columnists have often used the \u2018latte line\u2019 or the \u2018Colorbond fence\u2019 as simple shorthand to separate Sydney\u2019s best-off residents from everyone else,\u201d writes Katie Cunningham. \u201cIt\u2019s a diagonal stripe that bifurcates the city, starting near the airport and running north and west.

      "bodyText": "Ben Youngs and Dan Cole are set to join Jonny Wilkinson as England\u2019s third-most capped men\u2019s international players on Thursday, with Eddie Jones poised to shuffle his side for their second match of the World Cup when they face the USA. Jones is also due to make a late call on the fitness of Henry Slade before naming his side on Tuesday after the utility back took a bang to the knee shortly after coming on against Tonga while Lewis Ludlam is in line for a first World Cup start in the back row. Youngs, who started against Tonga, and Cole, who came off the bench, are also set to feature in the 23-man squad and win their 91st England caps. Only Jason Leonard (114) and Dylan Hartley (97) have represented the England men\u2019s side on more occasions. England flew south to Kobe on Monday 24 hours after opening their World Cup campaign with a scratchy bonus-point win over Tonga. They will have one proper training session on Wednesday before facing the USA. The two injury absentees are Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell, who are not due to be ready until the third pool match against Argentina on Saturday week, though England were awaiting further medical reports on Slade\u2019s knee before Jones finalises his team on Tuesday. It was the same knee Slade injured in the buildup to England\u2019s first World Cup warm-up match against Wales last month, though he was able to finish the match against Tonga. Joe Cokanasiga has also been hampered with a knee injury and his leg has been heavily strapped. After Sunday\u2019s victory Jones was unsure how many of the 23 who featured would also be involved against the USA. Youngs may start on the bench with Willi Heinz in the No 9 jersey while Cole is more likely to start in place of Kyle Sinckler. At least nine of the starting XV against Tonga are set to be involved despite the four-day turnaround. \u201cI\u2019m in this World Cup bubble at the moment and, whilst those accolades are nice, I had no idea,\u201d said Youngs, who will equal Wilkinson as England\u2019s most capped back. \u201cI remember making my first start for England and Jonny was involved and playing in Australia. He\u2019s an icon of the game and to get this accolade is pretty cool. \u201cWhen you first start out it goes fast and you\u2019re in it and not really sure what\u2019s going on. And then you get older and understand what gets you there, how you do it and how you sustain it. Getting there is almost the easy bit, the hard bit is sustaining it and staying there and being consistent in it.\u201d England will be hoping for a far more polished performance after a litany of handling errors against Tonga meant the bonus point was not secured until the 77th minute. Last autumn, in an effort to prepare for this four-day turnaround Jones purposefully curtailed his side\u2019s preparations before their victory over Japan, against whom he made 11 changes from the previous weekend. Ruaridh McConnochie, Mark Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Piers Francis and Jack Singleton were all hoping to be brought into the 23 for Thursday, having missed out in Sapporo, while Ludlam is set to cap a remarkable rise with a start at flanker. \u201cIf you had told me this time last year that I would be starting in a World Cup game, I would\u2019ve told you you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cOur focus last week was purely Tonga and as soon as that whistle went after the game, it switches to USA. It wasn\u2019t a case or preparing for two games.\u201d The USA have named eight England-based players in their 23-man squad, including the Saracens prop Titi Lamositele, Harlequins\u2019 former American footballer Paul Lasike and the Bedford full-back Will Hooley, whom Ludlam played alongside at junior level. \u201cWe were both at Ipswich Rugby Club and then he was at school 10 minutes down the road from me,\u201d Ludlam said. \u201cIt is weird he is playing for a different country but he is a really good bloke, he is down to earth, he is a good leader and I am sure he is keeping those USA boys in place.\u201d On Sunday Jones claimed that the USA would be \u201call guns blazing, it\u2019s going to be like 15 Donald Trumps\u201d, but their coach, Gary Gold, opted against returning fire. \u201cAt this stage, with all due respect, we\u2019re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that. I don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d",

They just kicked away possession a bit too much. They have a certain style of playing with George Ford and Owen Farrell there. We know that England are going to play that way, back their defence and use the aerial battle, which they used very well. Jonny May was brilliant before he went off, Anthony Watson as well. But it was more the situations where there was turnover ball, in and around the halfway. When Tonga kicked poorly, for at least the first hour England just kicked it back.</p> \n<p>It is an effective way of playing but you saw what happened when Watson decided to put the afterburners down and have a bit of a crack. Yes, it was against tiring defence and I\u2019m not saying it was a poor tactic but in certain situations, turnover ball or when Tonga kicked poorly, they had an opportunity to play a couple of phases. They could have stretched it to the edge \u2013 they have kickers on the edge, May can kick, Watson can kick, Daly can kick, so I just think they could have got the ball there a little bit more.</p> \n<p>England\u2019s kicking is fantastic, there is such clarity to it, and everyone knows precisely what they need to do. You see it off kick-offs, exiting from their 22, whether it\u2019s five- or six-man lineouts, whether they are driving then a box kick, or there\u2019s one phase with Billy Vunipola hitting up and then a box-kick from there or use Ford and Farrell with those high crossfield kicks. It may be a bit predictable but it\u2019s hard to stop. We will see plenty more of it. I would have just liked to see a bit more variety against Tonga.</p>",

England were equally impressive in the air but, if I have one complaint about their performance, it is that they kicked a little too often when they might have shown more ambition. They just kicked away possession a bit too much. They have a certain style of playing with George Ford and Owen Farrell there. We know that England are going to play that way, back their defence and use the aerial battle, which they used very well. Jonny May was brilliant before he went off, Anthony Watson as well. But it was more the situations where there was turnover ball, in and around the halfway. When Tonga kicked poorly, for at least the first hour England just kicked it back. It is an effective way of playing but you saw what happened when Watson decided to put the afterburners down and have a bit of a crack. Yes, it was against tiring defence and I\u2019m not saying it was a poor tactic but in certain situations, turnover ball or when Tonga kicked poorly, they had an opportunity to play a couple of phases. They could have stretched it to the edge \u2013 they have kickers on the edge, May can kick, Watson can kick, Daly can kick, so I just think they could have got the ball there a little bit more. England\u2019s kicking is fantastic, there is such clarity to it, and everyone knows precisely what they need to do. You see it off kick-offs, exiting from their 22, whether it\u2019s five- or six-man lineouts, whether they are driving then a box kick, or there\u2019s one phase with Billy Vunipola hitting up and then a box-kick from there or use Ford and Farrell with those high crossfield kicks. It may be a bit predictable but it\u2019s hard to stop. We will see plenty more of it. I would have just liked to see a bit more variety against Tonga.",

      "body": "<p>Brexit continues to turn everything it touches to dust. There are no wise people left, so it can only now take pleasure by making fools of fools. Easy pickings but good for the LOLs. It\u2019s come down to this for Labour. On the third day of its conference in Brighton, the best result for the party would have been for all three contradictory Brexit motions to have been passed.</p> <p>That way everyone could have gone home happy in a state of constructive ambiguity. The Momentum remainers who had backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 precisely because he had promised party members a say in forming policy would feel their voice had been heard. Those Momentum members for whom Corbyn had only ever been the once and future king would have made their mark. And the old guard of the national executive committee (NEC) who had always traditionally stitched up policy behind the scenes would be free to do so again. Come the Clause V meeting to write the next election manifesto, the NEC would have a free rein. Win-win for everyone.</p> <p>Only it turned out that the Labour party is even more self-destructive than anyone had imagined. The afternoon drama had begun with Emily Thornberry giving her keynote speech. One pitched more as a fading cabaret act \u2013 nudge nudge, wink wink \u2013 than as a shadow foreign secretary. Almost as if she knew her days might be numbered with her unequivocal support for Labour campaigning as a remain party at the next election and wanted to leave the stage with one last hurrah.</p> <p>Then came the debate on the three competing motions: the NEC statement committing Labour to only deciding what side to support in a second referendum after a special conference following an election won by Jeremy Corbyn; composite 13 committing Labour to supporting remain going into the imminent election; and composite 14 disagreeing with the need for a decision on what side to support in a referendum to be postponed because the Messiah had already given absolute clarity on his position. It was just conference\u2019s bad luck that no-one in the hall was enlightened enough to determine what it was.</p> <p>There was a moment\u2019s silence before Wendy Nichols, the chair for the debate who appeared to have been chosen solely because she could be relied on to be totally useless, called on everyone to engage in collective spiritual bargaining through transcendental meditation. Om. Nothing. Om, Om. Still nothing. Nichols then called on an interpretive dance troupe to explain Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position through Dadaist performance art. That wasn\u2019t much help either. Still, no one had ever pretended Jeremy ever took anything but the road less travelled.</p> <p>Things quickly turned nasty in the hall, as many of the grassroots members who were brandishing placards saying \u201cLabour members say stop Brexit\u201d began to suspect that the party hierarchy had packed the room with stooges. Old habits die hard. Never hold a vote unless you know the outcome in advance. Something David Cameron should have remembered three years earlier.</p> <p>Speaker after speaker came to the podium to declare undying loyalty to Corbyn. Brexit had become a side issue, a neoliberal conspiracy to stop the country from talking about Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity policies. Remain and leave were just arbitrary constructs of false consciousness. Nothing was more important than maintaining belief in Jeremy. To have even a trace of doubt in Corbyn\u2019s divinity was a complete betrayal. There could be no challenge or sign of original thought. Total belief was all that counted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/22/labour-commits-hara-kiri-by-copying-tories-playbook-on-drive-by-shootings\">Labour commits hara-kiri by copying Tories' playbook on infighting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Come the votes, the NEC statement and composite 14 were passed overwhelmingly. Chants of \u2018Oh Je-re-my Cor-byn\u2019 broke out around the room. The good old days were back again. Composite 13 appeared to be too close to call. To everyone except Nichols, who was having her ear bent by Jennie Formby, general secretary of the Labour party, sat beside her on the stage.</p> <p>\u201cUm, I though the vote had gone one way,\u201d Nichols said, \u201cBut Jennie\u2019s just told me something else. So the vote is lost.\u201d VAR had ruled. Cue uproar and demands for the vote to be rerun on a card count rather than a show of hands.

      "bodyText": "Brexit continues to turn everything it touches to dust. There are no wise people left, so it can only now take pleasure by making fools of fools. Easy pickings but good for the LOLs. It\u2019s come down to this for Labour. On the third day of its conference in Brighton, the best result for the party would have been for all three contradictory Brexit motions to have been passed. That way everyone could have gone home happy in a state of constructive ambiguity. The Momentum remainers who had backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 precisely because he had promised party members a say in forming policy would feel their voice had been heard. Those Momentum members for whom Corbyn had only ever been the once and future king would have made their mark. And the old guard of the national executive committee (NEC) who had always traditionally stitched up policy behind the scenes would be free to do so again. Come the Clause V meeting to write the next election manifesto, the NEC would have a free rein. Win-win for everyone. Only it turned out that the Labour party is even more self-destructive than anyone had imagined. The afternoon drama had begun with Emily Thornberry giving her keynote speech. One pitched more as a fading cabaret act \u2013 nudge nudge, wink wink \u2013 than as a shadow foreign secretary. Almost as if she knew her days might be numbered with her unequivocal support for Labour campaigning as a remain party at the next election and wanted to leave the stage with one last hurrah. Then came the debate on the three competing motions: the NEC statement committing Labour to only deciding what side to support in a second referendum after a special conference following an election won by Jeremy Corbyn; composite 13 committing Labour to supporting remain going into the imminent election; and composite 14 disagreeing with the need for a decision on what side to support in a referendum to be postponed because the Messiah had already given absolute clarity on his position. It was just conference\u2019s bad luck that no-one in the hall was enlightened enough to determine what it was. There was a moment\u2019s silence before Wendy Nichols, the chair for the debate who appeared to have been chosen solely because she could be relied on to be totally useless, called on everyone to engage in collective spiritual bargaining through transcendental meditation. Om. Nothing. Om, Om. Still nothing. Nichols then called on an interpretive dance troupe to explain Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position through Dadaist performance art. That wasn\u2019t much help either. Still, no one had ever pretended Jeremy ever took anything but the road less travelled. Things quickly turned nasty in the hall, as many of the grassroots members who were brandishing placards saying \u201cLabour members say stop Brexit\u201d began to suspect that the party hierarchy had packed the room with stooges. Old habits die hard. Never hold a vote unless you know the outcome in advance. Something David Cameron should have remembered three years earlier. Speaker after speaker came to the podium to declare undying loyalty to Corbyn. Brexit had become a side issue, a neoliberal conspiracy to stop the country from talking about Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity policies. Remain and leave were just arbitrary constructs of false consciousness. Nothing was more important than maintaining belief in Jeremy. To have even a trace of doubt in Corbyn\u2019s divinity was a complete betrayal. There could be no challenge or sign of original thought. Total belief was all that counted. Come the votes, the NEC statement and composite 14 were passed overwhelmingly. Chants of \u2018Oh Je-re-my Cor-byn\u2019 broke out around the room. The good old days were back again. Composite 13 appeared to be too close to call. To everyone except Nichols, who was having her ear bent by Jennie Formby, general secretary of the Labour party, sat beside her on the stage. \u201cUm, I though the vote had gone one way,\u201d Nichols said, \u201cBut Jennie\u2019s just told me something else. So the vote is lost.\u201d VAR had ruled. Cue uproar and demands for the vote to be rerun on a card count rather than a show of hands. That way there would be no room for error and no votes accidentally included from anyone ineligible. Heaven forbid. Nichols hastily doubled down on her own fuck-ups. \u201cThe vote has been passed,\u201d she said. Formby pulled out a gun and pointed it at her head. \u201cI meant lost. Lost. Lost. LOST.\u201d Jeremy had definitely won. He had at least 110% of the vote. It had been the most democratic vote in the history of all democratic votes. The confusion had been that all the remainers couldn\u2019t see all the people who had voted for Jeremy who had been standing just outside the hall. It had been a shambles. Labour had clutched defeat from the jaws of ambiguity. Just when the Tories were on their knees, Labour had proved itself unwilling to subject itself to scrutiny.

Many remain campaigners are unhappy with Corbyn\u2019s stance and wanted an unequivocal policy of campaigning to stay in the EU going into an election. MPs in marginal seats, including shadow cabinet ministers, are also concerned the Lib Dems, who have a policy of revoking article 50, could take a significant amount of votes off them at an election without a more pro-remain stance.

As recriminations flew, government-chartered aircraft began flying 150,000 stranded Thomas Cook customers back to the UK after the 178-year-old tour operator collapsed into liquidation in the early hours of Monday under the weight of its debts. Around 9,000 UK staff are facing redundancy, while thousands of holidaymakers were left waiting for the state-backed airlift in airports from the US to mainland Europe and north Africa, after weekend talks about a \u00a31.1bn financial rescue fell apart. The discussions were abandoned on Sunday after the government turned down the company\u2019s request for financial support to help tide it over the winter. Details of the government\u2019s refusal to step in came as current and former Thomas Cook executives faced criticism for multimillion-pound pay deals in recent years. The firm\u2019s last three chief executives took home combined pay packages \u2013 including bonuses \u2013 worth more than \u00a335m in the past 12 years, triggering calls from the Labour party for the bosses to return their windfalls.

Staff at the company\u2019s Peterborough headquarters and in its 560 high street shops were formally notified of the collapse on Monday morning. \u201cIt is a matter of profound regret to me and the rest of the board that we were not successful,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser. \u201cThis marks a deeply sad day for the company.\u201d Many staff left the building in tears. The business minister, Andrea Leadsom, has written to the insolvency service asking it to investigate the role of directors in the company\u2019s demise. Leadsom also wants reassurances about the firm\u2019s pension scheme. Labour called on its last three chief executives \u2013 Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Harriet Green and Fankhauser \u2013 to hand back some of the \u00a335m they were collectively paid in recent years. Thomas Cook buckled under the weight of a \u00a31.7bn debt pile racked up during an ill-fated acquisition spree. Deals include the 2010 tie-up with Co-op Travel, which gave it a total of 1,200 high street outlets, even as customers were increasingly buying their holidays online. It narrowly escaped administration in 2011 and had to be rescued by its lenders, leading to even higher debts, that have since racked up \u00a31.3bn in interest payments.",

Mr Corbyn has shown he can win by bringing people together. For the country\u2019s \u2013 and Labour\u2019s \u2013 sake he ought to continue to do so.",

If she\u2019s there because of Boris\u2019 personal interest with her that\u2019s appalling.\u201d</p> <p>Another, Aldo de Pape, founder and chief executive of TeachPitch, a web-based learning platform that helps teachers and schools identify the best online resources available, said Arcuri told fellow delegates she was friends with Johnson.</p> <p>De Pape said: \u201cShe was quite vocal and fairly eccentric in how she expressed herself and also quite open about her personal relationship with Johnson. She said she was friends with him. She didn\u2019t imply anything romantic.\u201d</p> <p>He said Johnson should explain his relationship with Arcuri. He said: \u201cIf she has been given public money just because of her personal relationship with Johnson then he should answer to that because that should not be the way to go. What\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Dismore, a Labour London assembly member who was on the finance committee at the end of Johnson\u2019s mayoralty, said: \u201cBoris has got a lot of explaining to do. It looks like he was using the GLA as his private fiefdom for his friends.\u201d</p> <p>He also threatened to summons documents from L&amp;P about how it made grants to Arcuri and how she was given a place on trade missions.</p> <p>Dismore said: \u201cWe have been having a long-running battle with L&amp;P about their lack of transparency. They operate in a very secretive way. We\u2019ll see what comes out of them voluntarily first. But if we have to summons the paperwork them I\u2019m sure we will. We need to be satisfied that due process was followed in the way this money was awarded.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the current London mayor, Sadiq Khan, stressed that the trade missions were a matter for Johnson. But Khan has asked his officials to \u201clook into what processes were followed during that time and that lessons are learnt for the future\u201d.</p>",

In March 2013, after Johnson faced a famously tough interview with Eddie Mair on the BBC about his conduct, including claims he made up quotes as a journalist and lied about an extra-marital affair, Arcuri leapt to his defence on Twitter. She said Johnson\u2019s personal business was not for the public to judge. In response to a Twitter user who said Johnson looked like a \u201cbumbling fool\u201d, she wrote: \u201cYesterday was a hiccup. It happens. Did every1 forget all the good he has done for #london?\u201d Arcuri was initially denied access to two trade trips organised by L&amp;P to New York and Israel. But after intervention from Johnson\u2019s office, she was allowed to join them. The L&amp;P spokesman said: \u201cOn the trade missions she was declined on two of them, and then at the request of Boris\u2019s team was given varying degrees of access to both New York and Tel Aviv. For a third trip to Malaysia and Singapore she applied and was accepted, and again Boris was not involved in that decision.\u201d Asked if a declaration of interest had been declared, he said: \u201cNot that I can see.\u201d One tech chief executive, who attended a five-day visit to Israel with Johnson and Arcuri in late 2015, said she was \u201cout of place on the trip\u201d. The CEO, who did not wish to be named, said Johnson had questions to answer. \u201cIf she was there because she was his friend, that seems completely unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always great tech that should be out being promoted. If she\u2019s there because of Boris\u2019 personal interest with her that\u2019s appalling.\u201d Another, Aldo de Pape, founder and chief executive of TeachPitch, a web-based learning platform that helps teachers and schools identify the best online resources available, said Arcuri told fellow delegates she was friends with Johnson. De Pape said: \u201cShe was quite vocal and fairly eccentric in how she expressed herself and also quite open about her personal relationship with Johnson. She said she was friends with him. She didn\u2019t imply anything romantic.\u201d He said Johnson should explain his relationship with Arcuri. He said: \u201cIf she has been given public money just because of her personal relationship with Johnson then he should answer to that because that should not be the way to go. What\u2019s the deal?\u201d Andrew Dismore, a Labour London assembly member who was on the finance committee at the end of Johnson\u2019s mayoralty, said: \u201cBoris has got a lot of explaining to do. It looks like he was using the GLA as his private fiefdom for his friends.\u201d He also threatened to summons documents from L&amp;P about how it made grants to Arcuri and how she was given a place on trade missions. Dismore said: \u201cWe have been having a long-running battle with L&amp;P about their lack of transparency. They operate in a very secretive way. We\u2019ll see what comes out of them voluntarily first. But if we have to summons the paperwork them I\u2019m sure we will. We need to be satisfied that due process was followed in the way this money was awarded.\u201d A spokesman for the current London mayor, Sadiq Khan, stressed that the trade missions were a matter for Johnson. But Khan has asked his officials to \u201clook into what processes were followed during that time and that lessons are learnt for the future\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson stonewalled repeated questions about a conflict of interest row over his grants of public money to an American businesswoman on Monday as more details emerged about the nature of their friendship. The British prime minister is under mounting pressure over revelations that Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s business, Innotech, banked \u00a326,500 in public money and the model-turned-tech entrepreneur attended three overseas trade missions led by him when he was London mayor. A second firm she is director of, Hacker House, received a further \u00a3100,000 this year from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), but now the department is investigating whether the business was eligible for grant. A DCMS spokesman said: \u201cWe regularly monitor grant initiatives and treat any allegations of impropriety with the utmost seriousness.\u201d Johnson, who refused six times to answer questions from reporters on a plane to New York for a UN summit, denied wrongdoing but refused to elaborate on his friendship with Arcuri during later broadcast interviews in the US on Monday. Nevertheless, the Guardian can reveal that: A tech CEO who attended a trade mission to Israel with the pair said Arcuri openly told delegates she was friends with Johnson. A second delegate who attended the trip said Arcuri, who was initially rejected from attending by organisers, was \u201cout of place\u201d on the visit. Arcuri leapt to Johnson\u2019s defence on Twitter after he had been quizzed on TV about lying in relation to an extra-marital affair saying it was \u201cpersonal\u201d business and that he was an \u201camazing leader\u201d. A London assembly member who sat on City Hall\u2019s finance committee during Johnson\u2019s mayoralty raised the prospect of an inquiry about the grants. Johnson has yet to explain his friendship with 34-year-old Arcuri after the Sunday Times revealed that he failed to declare a series of potential conflicts of interest. Asked about the claims, Johnson told the BBC: \u201cAll I can say is I\u2019m very proud of what we did when I was mayor of London, very proud of everything that we did, particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd I can tell you absolutely that everything was done entirely in the proper way.\u201d In a subsequent interview with Sky News, Johnson was pressed on the claims he faced a potential conflict of interest but he again declined to engage with the question, saying only that as mayor he had been \u201cbeating the drum\u201d for London. It comes after \u201cethical hacker\u201d Arcuri \u2013 who first met the politician when she joined his 2012 mayoral campaign after moving to the UK \u2013 was reportedly handed a total of \u00a3126,000 in public money. Johnson, 55, who was the capital\u2019s mayor between 2008 and 2016, was reportedly a regular visitor to Arcuri\u2019s east London flat. Arcuri, who was then in her late 20s, described Johnson as \u201cone of her best friends\u201d. Johnson appeared at four events for Arcuri\u2019s Innotech, a firm which organises summits for young technology entrepreneurs based in east London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout. In October 2013, Innotech received a \u00a310,000 grant from London &amp; Partners (L&amp;P), a promotional group which Johnson was responsible for as mayor.

You don\u2019t see those around any more \u2013 in the months when Jeremy Corbyn was dragging his feet about backing a second referendum, the message no longer seemed consistent \u2013 but it is worth recalling the slogan because it helps puts today\u2019s vote in perspective. A significant number of Labour members have decided that, when faced with a choice, loving Corbyn comes first.</p> \n  <p>I say \u201csignificant number\u201d because, without a card vote, we don\u2019t know what the exact voting figures were, and whether Corbyn would have won the votes without the support of the unions. The unions have 50% of the vote at conference and most of them were opposed to the \u201cback remain now\u201d composite 13. It was only going to pass if the vast majority of CLP delegates supported it. Last night that looked like a distinct possibility: of the 90 motions submitted by CLPs on Brexit, 81 of them were calling for Labour to back remain. But the decision by Momentum this morning to advise its supporters to vote against composite 13 (see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/23/brexit-latest-news-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-warned-it-would-look-awful-if-he-only-wins-key-labour-brexit-conference-vote-with-union-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d8893ce8f08f30dc5bc0997#block-5d8893ce8f08f30dc5bc0997\">10.45am</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/23/brexit-latest-news-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-warned-it-would-look-awful-if-he-only-wins-key-labour-brexit-conference-vote-with-union-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d88e9188f08f30dc5bc0e0e#block-5d88e9188f08f30dc5bc0e0e\">4.48pm</a>) seems to have swayed the vote. About 70% of CLP delegates are said to be Momentum supporters. Forced to make a choice, a largish number of them \u2013 certainly enough to overturn expectations \u2013 lined up behind the leadership.</p> \n  <p>Listening to the debate, it was clear that the argument that the party should unite behind Corbyn carried weight \u2013 and that passing composite 13 would be seen by the media as a terrible defeat for him.</p> \n  <p>But there were also legitimate objections to composite 13 on policy grounds. Unite\u2019s Howard Beckett (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/23/brexit-latest-news-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-warned-it-would-look-awful-if-he-only-wins-key-labour-brexit-conference-vote-with-union-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d88e6558f08f30dc5bc0dc4#block-5d88e6558f08f30dc5bc0dc4\">4.38pm</a>) put this argument as well as anyone, saying it would be a \u201ccar crash\u201d if Labour was committed to obtaining a Brexit deal that it was already determined to campaign against.</p> \n  <p>The remainers think Labour will haemorrhage votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens at the general election under the Corbyn policy that will now remain unchallenged until the election. The Corbynites think turning Labour into a remain-only party would be even more disastrous. There is no way of knowing which analysis is more correct. And a huge amount will depend on what has happened to Brexit by the time the election actually happens. It is quite possible that both arguments are right.</p> \n  <p>Still, this is a very good night for Jeremy Corbyn, who has won a clear victory over his remain opponents in the party. It is probably a good night for Jo Swinson too, as the Lib Dems and the Greens now have the undiluted remain field (in England, at least) to themselves.

Labour wants to reduce this by five hours over a decade.</strong> It views this as a political commitment, not a legally binding one. It is not planning to give every individual worker the right not to have to work more than 32 hours a week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Part of the plan is to ensure that workers can benefit more from productivity increases.</strong> McDonnell believes that for much of the last 150 years or so increases in productivity led to shorter working hours.

This is the composite motion backing the leadership position although, unlike the NEC statement, it does not say explicitly that the decision on the party\u2019s stance in a referendum should be postponed.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s actually rather less generous than it appears. That\u2019s to achieve the same level of social care that we get at the moment, just for more people. So it\u2019s not returning the system to where it was in 2010 which would cost an additional \u00a36bn because it\u2019s been restricted so much. You really do have to have quite severe needs to get that social care.</p> \n   <p>And secondly it\u2019s not going to save many people from the catastrophic cost that you can face if you go into residential care because it\u2019s not going to cover the cost of the accommodation and so on that you get there. So, whilst its expensive, it is nevertheless a relatively limited offer.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the overall credibility of Labour\u2019s spending plans, Johnson sounded sceptical. He said that at the last election Labour was proposing spending increases worth around \u00a370bn a year, and tax increases worth around \u00a350bn a year. But Johnson said he thought Labour would only raise about \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn from its tax plans. And he said, in practice, Labour might have ended up spending more. He said the current Tory government is increasing health spending by more than Labour proposed, and that in reality a Labour government would have been spending more than it planned on health too. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at such a big set of changes in terms of what they were saying a couple of years ago it is really not so much a question of does it all add up fiscally, it\u2019s a question of is it actually deliverable, either in terms of the level of tax increases or deliverable in terms of particularly the very large levels of investment spending they are suggesting.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T09:00:05.503Z\">at 10.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8877418f08f9df5bdd99b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T07:43:41.717Z\">8.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour will build a national network of charging points for electric vehicles at a cost of \u00a33.6bn to kickstart its planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/27/labour-green-industrial-revolution\">\u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d</a> if elected, the party has announced this morning.

Corbyn accepted remain as the party\u2019s position, members adored him for other reasons, and mostly this contradiction has been glossed over. At the last two party conferences Labour used classic procedural ploys to defuse a split on this issue; in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/24/labour-conference-accused-of-ducking-debate-over-brexit\">members decided to shelve a proposed debate on Brexit to avoid the need for a row</a>, and last year the party adopted a compromise \u201call options on the table\u201d composite on a second referendum that satisfied remainers while not actually committing the party to anything.</p> \n  <p>But this year it looks as though a split can be avoided not longer. As we explain in our overnight story, delegates will be asked to choose between two rival Brexit motions - one setting out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s preference, which is for the party to postpone deciding whether it will campaign for remain in a second referendum until after the election, and another saying the party should commit to remain now. As our story explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Corbyn\u2019s] proposal to put off the decision until after an election was endorsed by the national executive committee, by 16 votes to 10, after members were asked to send their agreement by email and without a meeting.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum \u2013 through a one-day special conference, following the election of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> government,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n   <p>However, pro-EU activists fought during a lengthy meeting on Sunday night to ensure there would be a vote on the conference floor on Monday on whether Labour should immediately adopt an unequivocally remain position.</p> \n   <p>More than 50 local parties swung behind a pro-remain motion, while eight backed a more neutral motion closer to the leadership\u2019s position. Both options will now be voted on by delegates, along with the official national executive position, leaving open the possibility that competing motions could pass and cause further confusion over the party\u2019s Brexit policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/22/corbyn-on-collision-course-with-labour-members-over-brexit\">Corbyn on collision course with Labour members over Brexit</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>At Labour conference trade unions have almost half the votes, and constituency Labour party (CLP) delegates have the other 50%. (A handful of non-union affiliated organisations have the rest.) Members are largely in favour of the \u201cback remain now\u201d approach, but the unions seem to be mostly behind the party leadership.</p> \n  <p>In a statement last night Michael Chessum, national organiser of <strong>Another Europe is Possible</strong>, which has been mobilising support for the \u201cback remain now\u201d motion, said that it would \u201clook awful\u201d if Corbyn won today just as a result of the union bloc vote. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Ninety percent of motions to this conference are anti-Brexit, reflecting a membership which is overwhelmingly pro-remain. We are taking a remain position to conference floor, where we are expecting a close vote. Using union bloc votes to defeat the overwhelming majority of members may well not work, and would look awful. </p> \n   <p>There will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn. We want a radical Labour government, and Corbyn in Number 10. The best way of getting there is with clarity on Brexit and a clear message to our members and voters that we are on their side.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is about to discuss this on Today.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.45am: </em>Conference opens.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has seen off an attempt by grassroots activists to force Labour to adopt an out-and-out remain position ahead of a general election. Workers will enjoy longer holidays under a future Labour government as part of a 10-year plan to see the length of the average full-time working week drop by five hours, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has announced. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. And this is from Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader. Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour party behind a remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart. He is determined to negotiate a Brexit deal if Labour win an election, despite all the evidence that there is no Brexit deal that is good for our economy, our NHS and our security. By refusing to say how the Labour party would campaign in a second referendum, Jeremy Corbyn is letting down the millions of people who want to see the UK remain in the EU. The Liberal Democrats are the only main party going into the next election promising to end the Brexit chaos. If the Liberal Democrats win the next general election, then we will use that democratic mandate to revoke article 50 on day one and stop Brexit. Here is the SNP\u2019s Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins on the Labour conference vote. Jeremy Corbyn is stuck firmly on the fence, refusing to come down \u2013 and today\u2019s votes show the rest of the Labour party is happy to stay there. This is a real abdication of leadership. It beggars belief that more than three years after the EU referendum, and knowing the damage Brexit will do, Labour is still arguing over its position. Labour are failing to be an effective opposition to the Tories, never mind a potential replacement. It is now crystal clear that the SNP is the only party in Scotland that can stop Brexit and beat the Tories. People in Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the one being imposed on us by Westminster. The SNP will continue to work to stop Brexit and protect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future as an independent country. From the Lib Dems This is from the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. At Labour conference last year there were many delegates going around wearing T-shirts saying \u201cLove Corbyn, Hate Brexit\u201d. You don\u2019t see those around any more \u2013 in the months when Jeremy Corbyn was dragging his feet about backing a second referendum, the message no longer seemed consistent \u2013 but it is worth recalling the slogan because it helps puts today\u2019s vote in perspective. A significant number of Labour members have decided that, when faced with a choice, loving Corbyn comes first. I say \u201csignificant number\u201d because, without a card vote, we don\u2019t know what the exact voting figures were, and whether Corbyn would have won the votes without the support of the unions. The unions have 50% of the vote at conference and most of them were opposed to the \u201cback remain now\u201d composite 13. It was only going to pass if the vast majority of CLP delegates supported it. Last night that looked like a distinct possibility: of the 90 motions submitted by CLPs on Brexit, 81 of them were calling for Labour to back remain. But the decision by Momentum this morning to advise its supporters to vote against composite 13 (see 10.45am and 4.48pm) seems to have swayed the vote. About 70% of CLP delegates are said to be Momentum supporters. Forced to make a choice, a largish number of them \u2013 certainly enough to overturn expectations \u2013 lined up behind the leadership. Listening to the debate, it was clear that the argument that the party should unite behind Corbyn carried weight \u2013 and that passing composite 13 would be seen by the media as a terrible defeat for him. But there were also legitimate objections to composite 13 on policy grounds. Unite\u2019s Howard Beckett (see 4.38pm) put this argument as well as anyone, saying it would be a \u201ccar crash\u201d if Labour was committed to obtaining a Brexit deal that it was already determined to campaign against. The remainers think Labour will haemorrhage votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens at the general election under the Corbyn policy that will now remain unchallenged until the election. The Corbynites think turning Labour into a remain-only party would be even more disastrous. There is no way of knowing which analysis is more correct. And a huge amount will depend on what has happened to Brexit by the time the election actually happens. It is quite possible that both arguments are right. Still, this is a very good night for Jeremy Corbyn, who has won a clear victory over his remain opponents in the party. It is probably a good night for Jo Swinson too, as the Lib Dems and the Greens now have the undiluted remain field (in England, at least) to themselves. What Boris Johnson thinks is harder to guess, but the Tories have been trying hard to label Labour as an anti-Brexit, remain party (not because they think it will help Labour, presumably), and tonight\u2019s vote undermines that line of attack. Nichols takes the vote on composite 14 (the pro-leadership one). It gets carried. So the two pro-leadership motions have been carried. Some delegates are calling for a card vote. Wendy Nichols, the chair, seems to be resisting this. She says whichever way she goes, she will be in trouble. She says: \u201cIn my view it was carried.\u201d Then she corrects herself. She says it was lost. Earlier, just before she announced the vote, she said that she thought it went one way, but that Jennie (Formby, Labour\u2019s general secretary, who is on the platform) thought it went another way. Nichols did not say who thought what, but when she announced the result initially (see 5.42pm) she said it had been lost. A delegate says this is one of the most important decisions facing the party. There should be a card vote. Nichols says the vote was lost. She wants the party to be right with itself. Delegates are now voting on composite 13. On a show of hands, it looks as if composite 13 has lost. The chair says that was lost. The conference has voted for the NEC motion on a show of hands. It was carried overwhelmingly. Some delegates are now singing \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Delegates back NEC statement calling for party to postpone decision on who to campaign in referendum. It is still possible that the contradictory motion, composite 13, could be carried. Delegates are about to vote on Brexit. A woman makes a point of order, and complains that a large number of people have just come into the hall. Are they entitled to be here? The chair says anyone who is not a delegate should leave. Starmer has now finished. At last year\u2019s conference he want off script, saying all options would be on the table if Labour did not get a general election, including a referendum with remain as an option. That went slightly further than what had been agreed. But today he was strictly on message. He confirmed that he would vote remain in a referendum (something he has said before), but he did not take a side on the issue at the heart of this debate - the split between composite 13 and the NEC statement. See 10.10am. Starmer is now on his peroration. Conference, the Tories have failed: they\u2019ve wrecked our economy, public services, and welfare state. They\u2019ve wrecked our international reputation. Their time is up. We have to beat them, and we will. We have to defeat Johnson, and we shall. And defeat his politics, to show that decency can triumph. We have to deliver a radical Labour government and give the people the final say on whether we remain in the EU. Starmer says Labour must recognise why people voted leave. But Brexit is deeper and bigger than our relationship with the EU. We will never get past Brexit if we don\u2019t understand why \u2013 when asked \u2013 so many millions said they wanted change. The people didn\u2019t just speak. They shouted. Millions told us that the current political and economic system isn\u2019t working. And they are right about that. The status quo is bust. Inequality and injustice are everywhere. We need a fundamental shift in power, and wealth, and opportunity. That\u2019s why our 2017 manifesto was so popular. We must build on it. Only a Labour government will end child poverty. Only a Labour government will confront the moral disgrace of homelessness. Only a Labour government will transform our economy to end insecure work - raise wages \u2013 and create good new jobs across the country. Only a Labour government will tackle the climate emergency, so we can look at the next generation in the eye and say \u2018we did not let you down\u2019. Starmer says he would campaign for remain. But he says he respects the rights of those to take a different view. Conference, you know where I stand on the question of remain: I\u2019ve said many times that I will campaign for it. But I profoundly respect those who take a different view. And conference, let\u2019s go into this with our eyes open. In 2016 Labour campaigned for remain. We did so because we are internationalists. We stand in solidarity with our friends and neighbours in Europe. We profoundly believe in peace, reconciliation, human rights and collaboration across borders. Socialist values. Our values. Then and now. And let those values guide us on the road ahead. Starmer turns to the election. The choice is stark. Lose, and the 2020s could be another lost decade. A no-deal Brexit, on top of a hard-right agenda that will strip back rights and protections and sell off public services. Win, and Labour can pull this country back from the brink: end austerity, rebuild our public services, and invest in our communities. The stakes could not be higher. (I am posting the quotes from the text sent out by Labour. Starmer is making some slight changes to the text, but what I am posting is not in any was significantly different from what he is saying.) Starmer says Labour has to find a way forward. Too much has happened in the last three years for this now to be decided without the consent of the public. We need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured. Or whether they wouldn\u2019t rather remain in the EU. The people must have the final say. A referendum in which \u2018remain\u2019 should \u2013 and will \u2013 be on the ballot paper. Along with the best leave deal that can be secured. We owe it to those who want to leave to secure that leave deal and put it to them in a referendum. But if remain wins, we will remain a member of the EU \u2013 a full member of the EU. Starmer says a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the country. Theresa May\u2019s government was called a zombie government. But at least she occasionally won a vote. With this government, it is Johnson nil, Corbyn six. Parliament had to pass a law to stop a no-deal Brexit. And yet Johnson\u2019s first instinct is to break the law. Starmer says if Johnson thinks he will be able to break the law, he has another thing coming. As soon as parliament returns, \u201cwe will be ready\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking now. Last year the conference gave Labour a roadmap, he says. \u201cYou asked us to vote down Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, and we did, three times.\u201d And they kept a referendum on the table. But now they face different challenges \u2013 a prime minister with no regard for the truth. Starmer says he does not believe a word Johnson says. Johnson said Brexit would free up more money for the NHS. It won\u2019t. He said prorogation was not about Brexit. But it was all about Brexit, he says. We definitely will get the results of the votes tonight, Labour are now saying. There were suggestions earlier we might have to wait until tomorrow. Joanna Gowers, from Finchley and Golders Green, says she does not like the EU. She thinks it has promoted neoliberalism. She came to the party conference opposed to a second referendum. But she says she thinks the party cannot go into an election with a fudged Brexit position. Alex Fernandes from Tooting CLP says he is addressing the party as an international socialist and Portuguese migrant. He says, as the largest party in Europe, they should campaign for their vision of socialism within the EU. He says: We cannot have socialism without international solidarity. Leaving the EU will not help migrants, he says. He says they should dismantle fortress Europe from within. Asra Anjum from Poplar and Limehouse CLP says she is speaking in favour of composite 13. She is speaking as a BAME candidate. She says her CLP is majority BAME, and it voted remain. Samuel East from Liverpool Walton CLP said Boris Johnson would be praying for Labour to end the day as a remain party. Members should say no to composite 13, he said. Here are three journalists on how the debate is going. From the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason From the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne (who I think means over-estimate) From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall Urte Macikene, from Dulwich and West Norwood, says the vast majority of Labour members back remain. Without their support, the party will not win the election, she says. She urges delegates to back composite 13 and to make it a socialist, internationalist anti-Brexit party. From Prospect\u2019s Tom Clark The Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar has the text of the Momentum briefing to members on how they should vote on Brexit. While we are talking about Tom Watson, this is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. From my colleague Heather Stewart Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has been speaking at a fringe event organised by the Labour Campaign for Gambling Reform. He said he was speaking about an issue \u201cvery dear to my heart\u201d, but he couldn\u2019t resist a pop at Jon Lansman, who led the attempt to abolish his post on Friday last week. \u201cThe first thing I will say is that if you had taken a bet on whether I\u2019d be deputy leader speaking at this event on Friday night, you\u2019d have made a lot of money, and I really hope some of you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the person you\u2019ve got to thank if you did is Jon Lansman.\u201d He added: \u201cJust to let you know, I\u2019m going to get Jon Lansman gags in at every fringe meeting I do all week.\u201d He went on to speak about the gambling reforms that Labour wants to introduce in government, like the creation of a new gambling ombudsman and the introduction of a new gambling act that takes into account the huge changes the industry has seen over the past few years. Jill Murdoch said the TSSA union told the conference earlier that her union \u201cunequivocally supports\u201d composite 13. But Unite\u2019s Howard Beckett spoke in support of the NEC statement and composite 14, and in opposition to composite 13. He said: Composite 13 seeks to define us now as a party of remain and say that any negotiated deal, no matter what is in it, should be rejected in favour of remain. As anyone who watched Emily Thornberry on Question Time will know, it\u2019d be a car crash to send Jeremy Corbyn into a general election saying that he can negotiate a credible deal when our position is one to reject that deal. He was referring to this clip. Hannah Patterson, from Leeds North West CLP, says the party needs a clear stance. It is not good enough to wait until after the election before deciding to back remain, she says. She says Scottish Labour, Welsh Labour and Labour in Northern Ireland all want the party to commit for remain. Vote for composite 13, she says. You can\u2019t always judge how a vote will go by how many people are speaking on each side, but the leadership camp are doing a better job at getting people to speak up for their side than the remain camp. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston thinks Jeremy Corbyn is on course to win. Noah Tucker from Tottenham CLP says his local party wants people to back Jeremy Corbyn. He has been right on tactics, he says. He says composite 13 would put Labour in a \u201cnightmare\u201d position. It would not be able to get anything other than a very, very bad deal, if the EU knows that Labour will campaign against it. Yet the public could vote for it in the referendum. He says Labour should not let Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson speak for the 52%. Labour needs to be the people who speak for the 99%. Gary Ostrolenk from Camberwell and Peckham CLP says a Labour government will face an onslaught from its enemies. It will need the support of the entire working class. If it alienates the 50% of that class who voted leave, they will turn their backs on Labour. Labour will not succeed. He urges members to vote against composite 13. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has been given a different steer on when we might get the results of votes from the one picked up by Steven Swinford. (See 4.19am.) Michelle Ryan, from East Worthing and Shoreham CLP, says composite 13 would put the party in the position of having to campaign against a deal it negotiated. That position has been widely mocked, she says. She says Jeremy Corbyn has also made it clear that he would prefer to be neutral. The Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford says, if there is a card vote, we will not get the result until tomorrow. Jean Roberts, from Brent Central CLP, says she voted leave. The EU is not a model democracy. It is run in the interests of corporations, she suggests. She says the party should unite behind the leadership and reject composite 13. These are from Sunder Katwala, a former general secretary of the Fabian Society. Juan Baeza, from Brighton Pavilion CLP, says members should unite behind the leader and reject composite 13. Rosie Rivers, a 17-year-old activist from Wealden CLP, told the conference she had a message for them that would make her unpopular. She was against the idea of holding a second referendum at all, she said. I know hundreds of people aged 16 to 25 and younger in my area who think it will create a divide that will be worse for us to grow up in. Kate Hudson from CWU says she is speaking in support of the NEC statement, \u201cour leader\u2019s position\u201d. When people are trapped in poverty and reliant on food banks, Brexit is drowning out the debates the party should be having, she says. She says, when Labour debates, \u201cthere are no enemies in this room\u201d. Labour\u2019s enemies are in Downing Street, she says. Sophie Wilson, a councillor from Sheffield Hallam CLP, says what her constituents need is a socialist government led by Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn\u2019s policy could not be more simple, she says. She says the party cannot ignore the votes of those who voted leave. She says it makes sense to leave the decision to a special conference after the election. She urges delegates to support composite 14. Duncan Enright says he is the first Labour mayor of Witney (David Cameron\u2019s constituency when he was an MP) for a generation. He urges the conference to back composite 13. Labour\u2019s position should be \u201cremain, revoke, reform\u201d, he says. Gordon McKay from Unison says it is almost 100 years since the Daily Mail owner said hate was the way to sell newspapers. One hundred years on, not much has changed. He says Unison will be voting for composite 13. But he says Unison cannot be accused of not backing Jeremy Corbyn. It supported him as leader in 2015, and again a year later. But Unison is committed to remain, he says. He says Boris Johnson and the other Brexiters want to privatise services. Does anyone think anything will get better under Brexit? Labour has to come to a view, support a second referendum and campaign for remain. Sophie Robbins from Twickenham CLP says trans people like herself have got more to fear than most from a no-deal Brexit. Hate crime has gone up since the Brexit vote, she says. From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith Two of the Brexit motions - the NEC statement and composite 13 - are contradictory. Catherine Pinder from the GMB says her union supports the Labour leadership\u2019s call for a second referendum. She urges delegates to support the NEC statement. See 10.10am. Richard Corbett MEP is speaking now. He says people should appreciate the extent to which Labour is united. It is united in opposing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit, and united in wanting a second referendum, and united in saying it would campaign for remain against Johnson\u2019s deal or no deal. The only difference is over what it would do if a Labour deal were on the table too. He says Labour has tried ambiguity. It tried it in the European election. But it haemorrhaged votes to the Greens and the Lib Dems, he says. He says it should commit to remain. We haemorrhaged votes to the Greens and the Liberal Democrats far more than we did to the Brexit party. It is an illusion to think that we could gain from gaining a slither of the smaller and declining number of Labour leave voters than we would lose at the same from the larger number and growing number of remain voters. After speeches for another foreign policy composite, the chair, Wendy Nichols, is now opening the debate up to speeches from the floor. She says she has about two and a half hours for the debate. There was loud cheering in the hall for the two speakers backing composite 13, but also for the two who were backing composite 14. It is not obvious that one side has more support than the other. Sion Rickard, from Aberconwy CLP, is seconding composite 14 now. He says he voted remain. But he says the party has to unite. He says the papers would love it if the party did not support Jeremy Corbyn. He says delegates need to trust Corbyn and his team on this issue. Alan Gibbons, from Liverpool Walton CLP, is moving composite 14 now. This is the pro-leadership one. See 10.10am. He says, after this debate, Labour members will have to campaign together. He says he voted remain. The Tories accuse Labour of holding up Brexit. But who has been in charge? The Tories. He says Labour will negotiate a better deal and give the public a choice. He says he personally will vote remain, but he will decide at the time. People need a Labour government, he says. Labour must be able to talk not just to the 52% or the 48% but to the 99%. He says when he is on picket lines, or boycotting the Sun, or feeding the homeless, or kicking fascists out of Liverpool \u2013 they need Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. So he urges delegates to support composite 14 and reject composite 13. Fiona O\u2019Farrell, from the Labour party Irish society, is seconding composite 13. She says Labour should support the motion on behalf of the people of Ireland, who would suffer if the open border gets undermined. At the conference delegates are now debating Brexit. Simon Hannah, from Tooting CLP, is moving composite 13. (See 10.10am.) He says he joined Labour when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. He is a Momentum member. He is no fan of the EU, he says. He says when Corbyn gave the EU seven out of 10, he thought Corbyn was being generous. But Hannah says it is clear nothing good will come from Brexit. The Labour movement is opposed to Brexit, he says. He says he is worried about the Lib Dems at the elections. Comrades, we cannot win an election by not taking sides. He says postponing a decision about who to campaign in an election will just generate confusion. He is loudly applauded. Alongside John McDonnell\u2019s speech, Labour has published two documents today fleshing out some of the ideas he was talking about. Here is a 28-page report (pdf) on universal basic services. McDonnell said Labour would expand the range of public services available for free. (See 12.25pm.) And here is a 12-page briefing (pdf) on the plan for a national care service. Here is the full text of Emily Thornberry\u2019s speech. Thornberry says it is not enough to address the injustices of today; the next Labour government must address the injustices of the past. She says Labour would apologise for the first Amritsar massacre, and hold an inquiry into Britain\u2019s role in the second. Labour would allow the Chagos islanders to return home. It would hold a judge-led inquiry into the UK\u2019s complicity in rendition and torture, she says. And she says she can announce two new pledges. She says Labour would compensate black African and Caribbean veterans who failed to get the same demob as white soldiers after the second world war. And it would pay a \u00a350,000 lump sum to veterans who were exposed to radiation during nuclear tests in the 1950s. It is not just their health that has suffered. Their children and grandchildren have been affected too. These payments would help with medical bills, she says. Thornberry says in government Labour would review arms sales. British arms should not be sold so they can be used to kill civilians abroad, she says. Thornberry says \u201cstrong man\u201d politics is an increasing threat to the world. She says it is not a surprise when the \u201cdaddy of them all\u201d, Donald Trump, is in the White House. She says Trump is leader of the free world. But how can you lead the free world when you support locking up toddlers, when you want to stop women having control over their bodies and when you support the annexation of Palestine. And she says no one has copied Trump more than the Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman. When he came to the UK, they rolled out the red carpet for him, she says. She says they needed a red carpet \u201cto cover up the blood dripping from his hands\u201d from the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and from the slaughter of civilians in Yemen. She says the age of impunity needs to end. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is addressing the conference now. She starts with a joke about the improbability of Boris Johnson being prime minister. She says that, in a future referendum on Brexit, she would campaign for remain. As [Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove] has said, we must fight with every fibre of our beings to say between now and October 31, and afterwards if there is a general election, that any terms of departure, from any government, must go back to the people for the final say. They should have the option to remain, and I for one will be out there campaigning to remain. And she pays tribute to her \u201cfriend\u201d and neighbouring MP, Jeremy Corbyn. We have been getting some more information from Labour about how the plan to introduce a 32-hour working week over a decade would work. (See 12.19pm and 12.21pm.) Here are some of the points that have emerged. John McDonnell is not proposing a French-style cap on maximum working hours. He was persuaded by the arguments in the report from Lord Skidelsky on working hours (pdf) that Labour published recently explaining a cap would not work. Instead, McDonnell plans to use two mechanisms to drive down average working hours over a decade - collective sectoral bargaining, and a working time commission. The working time commission, based on the low pay commission (which oversees the minimum wage and the national living wage) would recommend increases in minimum holiday entitlements. Over time, it is envisaged that these would go up. And collective sectoral bargaining - a landmark Labour pledge, which could have a huge impact how firms deal with their employees - would also play a part, because it would provide a mechanism by which working hours could be cut. The average working week is currently 37.1 hours. Labour wants to reduce this by five hours over a decade. It views this as a political commitment, not a legally binding one. It is not planning to give every individual worker the right not to have to work more than 32 hours a week. Part of the plan is to ensure that workers can benefit more from productivity increases. McDonnell believes that for much of the last 150 years or so increases in productivity led to shorter working hours. But in recent years workers have not benefitted from those productivity increases, he believes. McDonnell does not believe that moving towards a shorter working week will cost jobs. He believes increasing productivity can make a shorter working week affordable. His team has not tried to produce costings for the impact of this policy. A 32-hour woking week is equivalent to a four-day working week if someone works eight hours a day. But McDonnell is not presenting this as a move to a four-day week. He thinks in different sectors staff will want to reduce hours in different ways. And now it has been confirmed. Turning away from the Labour conference for a moment, the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg says we will get the supreme court decision as to whether Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week prorogation of parliament was lawful at 10.30am tomorrow. Here is some Twitter reaction to the John McDonnell speech from journalists. From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From Sky\u2019s Ed Conway From my colleague Jonathan Freedland From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From my colleague John Crace From ConservativeHome\u2019s Mark Wallace Yasmine Dar, a CLP representative on the national executive committee, is addressing the conference now. She is moving the the NEC statement about Brexit. (See 10.10am) She says passing this motion will not stop delegates being able to debate and vote on the other Brexit motions. She says Brexit should not be allowed to divide the party. \u201cPlease, comrades, support Jeremy [Corbyn] on this issue,\u201d she says. McDonnell is now on his peroration. When they ask you some time in the future: Where were you when people were left to sleep on our streets? When families queued at food banks to survive? When the Tories tried to sell out our country to Trump. When climate change threatened our planet and our very existence? I want you all to be able to say: I built the homes and public services our people needed. I made sure everyone was fed and cared for. With nobody forced to endure poverty. I saved the planet by tackling climate change. I helped lay the foundations of a new society. Foundations so deeply rooted that the Tories can never break them up. And when they ask: how did you do that? You can tell them: I supported Labour, I joined Labour, I voted for Jeremy Corbyn. That\u2019s how. Solidarity. McDonnell says Labour would give developing countries free or cheap access to green technologies, partly to make \u201creparations\u201d for colonialism. We recognise that the first industrial revolution meant Britain was the first major contributor to climate change \u2013 something that left a lasting legacy for the global south. And to begin making some reparations for our colonial past, I pledge we will provide to the citizens of the global south free or cheap access to the green technologies developed as part of our green industrial revolution. McDonnell says Labour would spend \u201cwhatever resources are necessary\u201d to meet climate change obligations. For my part, I will make sure the Treasury puts in whatever resources are necessary to meet our obligations. A sustainable investment board, coordinating the Treasury, BEIS department and Bank of England. \u00a3250bn of green government investment in a national transformation fund. And \u00a3250bn more of lending through our national investment bank, delivered at grassroots level by regional development banks and our new post bank. And while the Labour government will need to take the lead, we\u2019ll make whatever reforms are necessary to ensure the finance sector isn\u2019t pushing the other way by investing in carbon-intensive sectors. That means billions more raised through green bonds and support for a Europe-wide green new deal programme so that we can bring forward significantly that 2050 target. McDonnell turns to climate change. I believe when historians write about 2019, the most important political event so far has not been replacing one useless Tory prime minister with another. It\u2019s been the emergence on the national scene of climate change as amongst the most urgent political questions of the day. And he pays tribute to the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion. And outside parliament I want to pay tribute to the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion. I have been proud to march and demonstrate with them. They have shamed older generations of politicians into taking climate change seriously and with the urgency it needs. Now it\u2019s essential that the Labour movement continues to join in solidarity with those young people to help lead that fight. McDonnell says Scotland would benefit from Labour\u2019s plan, even though it already has free personal care. Of course, in Scotland, a Labour government has already introduced free personal care, so when we spend the billions needed to guarantee free personal care in England, there will be billions more for First Minister Richard Leonard when he takes office in 2021. A Labour government making millions of lives better across the UK, thanks to our transformative policies in Westminster, but also through the new resources for the Scottish and Welsh governments. McDonnell gives more details about the proposed national care service. So I can announce today that, after years of campaigning by trade unions and carers, as the first building block in our new national care service, the next Labour government will introduce personal care free at the point of use in England. Funded not through the Conservatives\u2019 gimmicky insurance schemes. But, like the NHS and our other essentials, through general taxation. And we\u2019re publishing the first steps of our national care service vision today. Investing in the workforce and ensuring they are employed on local authority rates of pay, working conditions and training to deliver high-quality care, as Unison has advocated. And over time, we will bring those services back into public ownership and democratic control. We will make sure that local councils have the necessary resources after years of savage cuts. Building up capacity in local government for both care homes and domiciliary care So we\u2019ll require all providers \u2013 public, private or charitable \u2013 to adhere to strict criteria on ethical standards. Because nothing is more important than dignity in retirement for those who have built our country and given younger generations the world we live in today. And I want to thank the hard work and leadership that Barbara Keeley has shown in driving forward our policy on this issue. McDonnell confirms the announcement about Labour offering free personal care. McDonnell says Labour would rebuild local democracy and revive local services. My generation inherited a treasure of public parks, libraries, swimming pools and leisure centres. Free or affordable for all. But in too many cases they\u2019re now gone. They\u2019ve been privatised or have priced out the families they were built for. These public assets meant a better life for millions of us. And were part of the strong welfare state that our movement fought for and built. Providing free at the point of use the things that make lives worth living. As well as the essentials like health, education, even those have come under attack in recent years But we mustn\u2019t limit our ambition to repairing the damage caused by nine years of Tory austerity. We must go much further. I\u2019m launching today our document on universal basic services. It lays out our belief that everyone has a right to a good life. That the state has responsibility to make good on that right. By providing public services free at the point of use. These services are part of our shared experiences. Experiences that are too important to be left to the vagaries of the market. Whether a family can afford them or not. As socialists we believe that people have the right to education, health, a home in a decent, safe environment and, yes, access to culture and leisure. McDonnell explains how Labour would go about this. As a first step we\u2019ll end the opt-out from the European working time directive. As we roll out sectoral collective bargaining, we will include negotiations over working hours. We\u2019ll require working hours to be included in the legally binding sectoral agreements. This will allow unions and employers to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector. And we\u2019ll set up a working time commission with the power to recommend to government on increasing statutory leave entitlements as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment. But while millions are exhausted from overwork, there are too many others who can\u2019t get the working hours they need, so we\u2019ll also ban zero-hour contracts to make sure every employee has a guaranteed number of hours a week too. McDonnell says Labour will aim to reduce the full-time working week to 32 hours within the next decade \u2013 with no loss of pay. We should work to live, not live to work. Thanks to past Labour governments but mainly thanks to the trade union movement, the average full-time working week fell from nearly 65 hours in the 1860s to 43 hours in the 1970s. As society got richer, we could spend fewer hours at work. But in recent decades progress has stalled. People in our country today work the longest average full-time hours in Europe apart from Greece and Austria. And since the 1980s the link between increasing productivity matched by expanding free time has been broken. It\u2019s time to put that right. So I can tell you today that the next Labour government will put in place the changes needed to reduce average full-time hours to 32 a week within the next decade. A shorter working week with no loss of pay. McDonnell says work is not just about wages. Work isn\u2019t just about wages. It\u2019s about freedom from drudgery; having dignity, respect and a voice in the workplace. That means a strong trade union movement and collective bargaining. But also, in the new public services we\u2019re creating, it means management by workers and service users rather than by remote bureaucrats in Whitehall. In large companies it means a third of directors being elected by workers and a tenth of shares being owned by those workers. It means doubling the size of our cooperative sector, and going further, I hope, in our ambitions. McDonnell says Labour would end in-work poverty. Labour has traditionally been committed to full employment. We have always believed that getting a job should be a means to lift yourself out of poverty. But under the Tories the link between work and escaping poverty has been broken. So I commit today that within our first term of office Labour will end in-work poverty. This is a current pledge. McDonnell explained how Labour would achieve this in a speech in July. McDonnell says article 50 should not be revoked without a referendum. I warn those who would revoke article 50 without a democratic mandate, ask yourselves what message that sends to our people. An old professor of mine, Bernard Crick, was once asked to define socialism in one sentence. He said socialism is the achievement of equality through democracy. We can\u2019t say to people, \u201cLabour wants you to share in the running of your workplace, your community and your environment, but we don\u2019t trust you to have the final say over Brexit.\u201d Nothing would do more to undermine their faith in democracy in all its forms. (There are few people in Labour arguing for article 50 to be revoked without a referendum. This passage seems to be aimed primarily at the Liberal Democrats.) McDonnell turns to Brexit. We aim to trust the people in having the final say on Brexit. A deal or remain. Some of you will know I have said I will campaign for remain. But let me make it clear that I profoundly respect those who support a genuine alternative. In our debates today I want us to demonstrate in the respect we show each other and how we bring our party together just how we can also bring the country together again. McDonnell says politics is going through a period of \u201cprofound insecurity\u201d. My fear, though, is that as a result of the behaviour, language and cynical opportunism of some politicians on the right, we have entered a period of profound insecurity and risk to our democratic system. We have seen before in our history what kind of forces can be unleashed by politicians who have a total disregard for the truth in their ruthless pursuit of power for power\u2019s sake \u2026 politicians who attack the very institutions and practices, no matter how flawed, that protect and uphold our democracy, parliament, the courts and the rule of law. The best antidote to those who attack our democratic rules and institutions is more democracy itself. McDonnell praises a friend who almost became leader of the Labour party by accident - Jeremy Corbyn. And what makes me so proud of him is that no matter what smears and personal attacks by the gutter press. He always continue to embody the kinder, gentler politics he advocates. McDonnell says he thinks Labour MPs should be supporting the unions, in parliament and on the picket line. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is delivering his speech now. He starts by paying tribute to all the members of his team, including Anneliese Dodds, who he says has found the \u201cmagic money tree\u201d in the Cayman Islands and is digging it up and bringing it home. She has been working on tax avoidance. Tom Watson thinks Jon Lansman, who tabled the motion at Labour\u2019s national executive committee without warning on Friday night in an attempt to abolish Watson\u2019s deputy leader post, is not the best person to complain about NEC processes being abused. (See 10.37am.) Ahead of the Brexit vote this afternoon Labour pro-remain campaigners are flagging up some figures from a poll conducted for the People\u2019s Vote campaign. It found that 72% of Labour leave voters said they would definitely not vote Conservative, and 48% said they would definitely not vote for the Brexit party. But only 14% of Labour remain voters said they would definitely not vote Lib Dems. Labour remainers think this shows that the fear of Labour losing millions of voters to leave parties is exaggerated; they claim the real risk is from Labour losing remain votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens. From the BBC\u2019s Peter Saull From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Without having been there, it is hard to know whether Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s complaint, that the journalists who were pushing their way past delegates were being \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, was fair or not. He seems to have been referring in particular to photographers and TV cameramen and when a large group of them are in a small space all trying to get a shot it can all get a bit rumbustious. A \u201cgoatfuck\u201d is the technical description often used. Still, berating journalists often does not go down well - with journalists. And only Corbyn can compress so much passive aggression into the phrase \u201cour friends in the media\u201d. Turning to Brexit, McCluskey urges the conference to back Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position, which is designed to ensure the party does not alienate leave voters. McCluskey says: Let me say here that Jeremy Corbyn is a thousand times right in trying to speak to our whole country at this time of crisis. When we have the Tories dismissing half of our nation. And the Liberals are writing off the other half. It is only Jeremy\u2019s Labour that puts social justice first, that says whether you are \u201cleave\u201d or \u201cremain\u201d matters less than your class. We should not let anyone define or divide us as leavers or remainers. What defines us is that we are socialists. And our vision of a better Britain, a better world, is within our grasp. And I beg you, comrades, keep your eyes on the prize. In a general election campaign people will see that only Labour offers policies to create a better and fairer Britain. Policies to heal our nation. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, the biggest union backing Labour, is speaking at the conference now. He starts with an attack on the Liberal Democrats. Austerity thrust on us by the Tories and their Liberal Democrat partners. Jo Swinson doesn\u2019t like Jeremy and the Labour party apparently, well, the feeling\u2019s mutual. Her party gave us austerity and destroyed our communities. She voted in favour of every attack on our welfare state. And we won\u2019t forget that. She reminds us that you can never trust a Liberal Democrat. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, addressed the conference this morning. He is in the \u201cback remain now\u201d camp on Brexit, as he made clear in a TV interview yesterday, but he largely avoided the topic in his speech. Instead he focused on domestic policy, making two proposals. Leonard said a Labour government would give the Scottish parliament power over employment law. He said: I am proud that our party will go into government with a new determination to shift power closer to the people. We will extend democracy not just at the ballot box, but in every workplace and in every community. And so let me be crystal clear, this democratic renewal, this redistribution of power we seek, this is not simply about parliaments and the members elected to them. It is about strong local government. It is about redressing the imbalance of power between tenant and landlord, between worker and owner, between citizen and state, between women and men. So the next Labour government will deliver a new Scotland Act, that will provide for the devolution of employment law with a UK wide floor. He said councils should be able to buy land for housing at existing use value. There is a housing emergency in Scotland and the price of land lies at the centre of it. So when we launch our housing commission report in the next few weeks, it will make radical recommendations which tackle the excess profits of property developers. Including a proposal to introduce a new law giving local councils, housing associations and housing co-operatives the right to acquire land at an existing use value. Good housing policy has always been at the core of Labour party values. It is where we came from. And under the Scottish Labour government that I lead, housing will become a national priority again. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh These are from my colleague Rowena Mason. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. These are from Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The fact that Unison, which controls a sizeable chunk of the union vote at conference, is going to vote against the NEC motion and in favour of composite 13 (see 10.10am), means that there is now a greater chance than we thought this morning that the conference could unequivocally come down in favour of committing to remain now. In Brighton we\u2019ve been given a bit more information from party officials about the process for the Brexit voting this afternoon. Here are the key points. Three separate Brexit proposals are being put to the vote. They are: 1) The NEC statement, saying: \u201cThe NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in [a referendum on Brexit] \u2013 through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government.\u201d 2) Composite 13 on Brexit. This is the \u201cback remain now\u201d one. It says: Labour must reflect the overwhelming view of its members and voters, who want to stay in the EU. Labour will therefore campaign energetically for a public vote and to stay in the EU in that referendum, while recognising the rights of those members who want to argue another view. 3) Composite 14 on Brexit. This is the composite motion backing the leadership position although, unlike the NEC statement, it does not say explicitly that the decision on the party\u2019s stance in a referendum should be postponed. It just says Jeremy Corbyn has made the way forward \u201cabundantly clear\u201d by backing a public vote. Labour accepts that all three motions could be passed - even though the NEC statement and composite 13 are contradictory. Today\u2019s votes will not automatically determine Labour\u2019s position at the next election, officials admit. The decision as to what goes into the manifesto will be taken nearer the time at a clause V meeting, where the NEC, the shadow cabinet and union leaders will agree the text of the document. If there are card votes, then results should be announced at some point int the evening - although it is not clear exactly when. Yesterday Jeremy Corbyn told Andrew Marr he would \u201cgo along with whatever decision the party comes to\u201d regarding Brexit. If the conference passes contradictory motions, that might not be straightforward. Here is the more detailed conference agenda for the day. 10am: Conference opens, with a report from Harry Donaldson, chair of the conference arrangements committee 10.10am: Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, speaks. 10.20am: Work, pensions and equality debate. 11.10am: Economy debate starts. Five composite motions are being debated, covering industrial strategy, insourcing, working hours, employment rights and the Royal Mail. And John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is winding up. 12.25pm: International debate, including the national executive committee statement on Brexit. 12.35pm: Voting on the morning\u2019s business. 2.15pm: The international debate continues. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is due open the debate, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is due to close it. As well as the two Brexit composites, composite motions on Yemen, an ethical foreign policy and human rights for the Uighurs are also being debated. 5.20pm: Voting on the afternoon\u2019s business. If there are card votes, as is almost certain for the Brexit motions, counting the card votes could take an hour or so. John McDonnell was giving interviews this morning to promote Labour\u2019s key overnight announcement, a \u00a36bn a year pledge to introduce free personal care. The Labour announcement is here, and my colleague Patrick Butler\u2019s story about it is here. On the Today programme this morning Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, said that Labour\u2019s personal care offer was \u201cless generous\u201d than it sounded. He explained: It\u2019s actually rather less generous than it appears. That\u2019s to achieve the same level of social care that we get at the moment, just for more people. So it\u2019s not returning the system to where it was in 2010 which would cost an additional \u00a36bn because it\u2019s been restricted so much. You really do have to have quite severe needs to get that social care. And secondly it\u2019s not going to save many people from the catastrophic cost that you can face if you go into residential care because it\u2019s not going to cover the cost of the accommodation and so on that you get there. So, whilst its expensive, it is nevertheless a relatively limited offer. Asked about the overall credibility of Labour\u2019s spending plans, Johnson sounded sceptical. He said that at the last election Labour was proposing spending increases worth around \u00a370bn a year, and tax increases worth around \u00a350bn a year. But Johnson said he thought Labour would only raise about \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn from its tax plans. And he said, in practice, Labour might have ended up spending more. He said the current Tory government is increasing health spending by more than Labour proposed, and that in reality a Labour government would have been spending more than it planned on health too. He went on: We are looking at such a big set of changes in terms of what they were saying a couple of years ago it is really not so much a question of does it all add up fiscally, it\u2019s a question of is it actually deliverable, either in terms of the level of tax increases or deliverable in terms of particularly the very large levels of investment spending they are suggesting. Labour will build a national network of charging points for electric vehicles at a cost of \u00a33.6bn to kickstart its planned \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d if elected, the party has announced this morning. My colleagues Fiona Harvey and Matthew Taylor have the full story here. And here is Labour\u2019s news release about the announcement. The GMB union will not be supporting the pro-remain composite in the debate this afternoon, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Tim Roache is the GMB\u2019s general secretary. McDonnell says it would not be responsible for Labour to back a no-deal Brexit. Q: The NEC wanted to hold a meeting on this yesterday, but it did not go ahead. McDonnell says he is not on the NEC. He says he has been told the first meeting over-ran, which is why a second one did not go ahead. Q: I\u2019ve been told Jon Lansman consulted the leader\u2019s office before he pushed for the deputy leader\u2019s post to be removed. McDonnell says Jeremy Corbyn has denied knowing about the Lansman motion. He says he supports the idea of having two deputy leaders. Q: Andrew Fisher\u2019s resignation shows all is not well with the party. McDonnell says everyone has a bad day at the office. He says he hopes that Fisher will stay on. Sometimes you can have a bad day in the office, sometimes your colleagues can drive you up the wall. He\u2019s staying until after the election at the end of the year and, if I have anything to do with it - this is just a message to Andrew - I\u2019m going to persuade you to stay. Q: But his criticisms were strong. McDonnell says everyone gets angry with their work colleagues from time to time. People lose their tempers. He is sure that this happens at the BBC too, he says. Not since John Humphrys has left, Martha Kearney, the Today presenter, jokes. And that\u2019s it. McDonnell explains the leadership position again. Labour would negotiate a new Brexit deal, then have a special conference where it would decide its position in that referendum. He says it is hard for people to decide their view when they don\u2019t know what the deal will say. Q: But you have. You say you will back remain. McDonnell accepts the point, but say people will want to see what the deal says. John McDonnell is on Today now talking about Brexit. He says he would vote remain in a future referendum. Q: If you think that, why shouldn\u2019t the party back remain? McDonnell says people should exercise their own judgement. Q: But if you, the shadow foreign secretary, the shadow Brexit secretary and most members want the party to back remain, can you still sit on the fence as a party? McDonnell says this is a democratic proposal. People have different views, he says. He rejects claims that the party is in the midst of a civil war. I smiled when you used the language earlier of civil war and revolt but there isn\u2019t any war in the Labour party. It\u2019s about honest, democratic debate. People have high emotions on this because they feel it\u2019s important. But that\u2019s not people respecting each other\u2019s views as well. I keep saying: do not mistake democracy for division. It isn\u2019t - what we\u2019re having is an honest debate. One of the many surprising features about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader in 2015 was that he managed to get chosen by a party that is overwhelming in favour of EU membership despite, for most of his career, being in favour of the UK being out. Corbyn accepted remain as the party\u2019s position, members adored him for other reasons, and mostly this contradiction has been glossed over. At the last two party conferences Labour used classic procedural ploys to defuse a split on this issue; in 2017 members decided to shelve a proposed debate on Brexit to avoid the need for a row, and last year the party adopted a compromise \u201call options on the table\u201d composite on a second referendum that satisfied remainers while not actually committing the party to anything. But this year it looks as though a split can be avoided not longer. As we explain in our overnight story, delegates will be asked to choose between two rival Brexit motions - one setting out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s preference, which is for the party to postpone deciding whether it will campaign for remain in a second referendum until after the election, and another saying the party should commit to remain now. As our story explains: [Corbyn\u2019s] proposal to put off the decision until after an election was endorsed by the national executive committee, by 16 votes to 10, after members were asked to send their agreement by email and without a meeting. \u201cThe NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum \u2013 through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government,\u201d the statement said. However, pro-EU activists fought during a lengthy meeting on Sunday night to ensure there would be a vote on the conference floor on Monday on whether Labour should immediately adopt an unequivocally remain position. More than 50 local parties swung behind a pro-remain motion, while eight backed a more neutral motion closer to the leadership\u2019s position. Both options will now be voted on by delegates, along with the official national executive position, leaving open the possibility that competing motions could pass and cause further confusion over the party\u2019s Brexit policy. At Labour conference trade unions have almost half the votes, and constituency Labour party (CLP) delegates have the other 50%. (A handful of non-union affiliated organisations have the rest.) Members are largely in favour of the \u201cback remain now\u201d approach, but the unions seem to be mostly behind the party leadership. In a statement last night Michael Chessum, national organiser of Another Europe is Possible, which has been mobilising support for the \u201cback remain now\u201d motion, said that it would \u201clook awful\u201d if Corbyn won today just as a result of the union bloc vote. He said: Ninety percent of motions to this conference are anti-Brexit, reflecting a membership which is overwhelmingly pro-remain. We are taking a remain position to conference floor, where we are expecting a close vote. Using union bloc votes to defeat the overwhelming majority of members may well not work, and would look awful. There will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn. We want a radical Labour government, and Corbyn in Number 10. The best way of getting there is with clarity on Brexit and a clear message to our members and voters that we are on their side. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is about to discuss this on Today. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Conference opens. Delegates will debate economic issues. 12pm: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, speaks. 2pm: Delegates start a debate covering foreign affairs and Brexit. 2.15pm: Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, speaks. 5.10pm: Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, speaks at the end of the debate. At that point delegates will vote although, if there is a card vote, the result will not be announced immediately. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will focusing almost exclusively on the Labour conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "body": "<p>Pretty much the first thing Junior Firpo did as a Bar\u00e7a player was miss the ball. The second was to fall flat on his face. He had been on the pitch for 54 seconds and as he lay on the grass, the soundtrack provided by a bloke with a swanee whistle and a set of cymbals, he watched the men in red and white run beyond him and a familiar scene unfold. It was happening again, only faster. At Athletic Bilbao on the opening night, Barcelona had gone behind in the 89th minute; against Betis a week later, it was the 17th; and at Osasuna, the sixth.</p> \n<p>This time, in week five at Granada, they had only just made it to the second when Ramon Azeez scored. This time, they wouldn\u2019t make it out of trouble. As for Junior, signed from Real Betis for \u20ac18m in the summer, he didn\u2019t make it out for the second half. Lionel Messi did, at last making his first league appearance of the season, and so did Ansu Fati, their hope at 16. Even they couldn\u2019t salvage anything from this wreckage. Arturo Vidal came on too. Pretty much the first thing he did was boot the ball off. The second was stick a hand out in the area. From the penalty spot, \u00c1lvaro Vadillo made it 2-0. It was all over. And, it was tempting to conclude, even this early, all might actually mean all. Barcelona had been beaten. Barcelona <em>are</em> beaten, it seems.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/23/marcus-thuram-bundesliga-gladbach-dusseldorf\">Marcus Thuram\u2019s derby double lifts Gladbach from European humiliation | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the night when Granada, with a budget that couldn\u2019t pay Messi let alone everyone else at the Camp Nou, their salary cap 18 times lower than Barcelona\u2019s, deservedly won 2-0, the story should have been about them. What they had done was, in their manager\u2019s too-literally-translated words, \u201cbarbaric\u201d. It should have been about how 11 of their players on Saturday were in the second division while Barcelona won the league last season. About how they have lost just once, against Sevilla on their first home game back <em>in primera</em>, and won three in a row since without conceding. It should have been about how victory momentarily took them top. Granada. Top. But it wasn\u2019t. And not just because Diego Mart\u00ednez, their manager, insisted that looking at the league was a \u201cwaste of time\u201d. Or even because the story almost never is about them when it can be <em>about them.</em></p> \n<p>It was because there was something about the way Barcelona were defeated, the way it managed to shock and not shock at all, that ran deeper. This wasn\u2019t just one game, and certainly wasn\u2019t just two men \u2013 still less Junior or Vidal, or even just Ernesto Valverde \u2013 however bad it had been. And, boy, had it been bad. It was difficult to remember a performance worse than this, and yet there was no lack of contenders.</p> \n<p>This was sudden; it was also a long time coming. Dreadful in defence, in midfield, up front. Nothing worked. \u201cNot even with Messi,\u201d ran the cover of AS, and there was something telling in that too. On Friday morning, El Mundo Deportivo gleefully splashed on Real Madrid in crisis. By the following night, it was Barcelona who were. And by the night after, Madrid were top.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis Barcelona lies in ruins,\u201d AS\u2019s headline ran. \u201cAnother disaster,\u201d El Mundo Deportivo said. At the end, Frenkie De Jong approached the fans and apologised. He must have wondered where he had ended up. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. \u201cFor Barcelona, every stadium is Anfield now,\u201d wrote Santi Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cThey are a drama of epic proportions, where anyone can strip them bare with startling ease.\u201d Something broke that night. Or maybe it\u2019s more accurate to suggest that something was revealed, and has not been remedied.</p> \n<p>They carried on regardless, reluctant to challenge the old order. But once it had happened it was more likely to happen again, a recurring nightmare. Rome resurfaced in Liverpool, and Liverpool resurfaces anywhere: Bilbao, Pamplona, Granada, Dortmund. The Camp Nou is one thing but Barcelona haven\u2019t won away since April. \u201cI am responsible,\u201d Valverde said. He meant for Saturday night but there\u2019s more. It is early, but it is their worst start in 25 years, and for all the coincidences \u2013 injuries, penalties, daft individual mistakes \u2013 it isn\u2019t entirely coincidental. They\u2019ve trailed in four of their five games and conceded in all of them. No one in La Liga has conceded more goals.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/05/the-fiver-email-sign-up\">Sign up to The Fiver email</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And this is more than that old, facile line about how Barcelona can\u2019t defend: they can\u2019t attack either. At Granada, they had one shot on target. Sure, they have been without Messi, Su\u00e1rez, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Neymar too, but it\u2019s not about that either; it\u2019s about the most basic thing of all, the essence of Barcelona, perhaps hidden behind Messi for too long: <em>the play</em>. Against Liverpool, there was something deeper than defeat. That this is a team losing its religion is an old debate, politicised and exaggerated: Barcelona have been the best team in Spain by miles over the last two years. For all the flaws, Anfield remains hard to explain. Nor were they as heretical, as un-Bar\u00e7a as some accusations had it. But there is something in it, in the lack of a structure, an idea, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/may/08/barcelona-anfield- ernesto-valverde-lionel-messi\" title=\"\">commitment to an identity</a>.</p> \n<p>It has been hard to avoid the feeling that too few of those that mattered, manager included, believed in the model. Slowly, football slipped from them. Xavi and Iniesta have gone. Messi is too often the team \u2013 a process in which he may not be entirely blameless \u2013 and one day, he will be gone too. That has created a kind of desperation. After the defeat in Liverpool, Valverde\u2019s time appeared to have come to a close, but it didn\u2019t. It is hard to see how you can recover from a moment like that. There\u2019s a feeling this is a season too far \u2013 two seasons too far, some critics insist. There are parallels to Guardiola\u2019s fourth season and Luis Enrique\u2019s third. Defeat brought opportunity, a chance to reset.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61912c566750245d0201b0b5a27fbb7462b6f2ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61912c566750245d0201b0b5a27fbb7462b6f2ca/0_13_2226_1335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barcelona\u2019s Antoine Griezmann has received a cold welcome from some team-mates since arriving from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barcelona\u2019s Antoine Griezmann has received a frosty welcome from some team-mates since arriving from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But they carried on; Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president, backed Valverde and some players did too: they were comfortable. Too comfortable. Valverde stands accused of allowing it. The decline went largely unchallenged. It is not that Barcelona are bad so much as that they\u2019re nothing in particular. De Jong came, someone to reinforce the model, but not always in his place: he has played too wide or not at all. The men alongside him have changed. There have been five different lineups in six weeks.</p> \n<p>Antoine Griezmann arrived, a year late. He has two positions: one is Messi\u2019s, the other is Su\u00e1rez\u2019s. The welcome was cold; those two wanted Neymar instead. Barcelona pursued the Brazilian publicly, driven by the president. They didn\u2019t sign him, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/barcelona/83/blog/post/3935670/barcelon a-didnt-buy-neymarbut-he-still-cost-them\" title=\"\">but he cost them</a>. The players who wanted him weren\u2019t happy, Messi among them, and the players that didn\u2019t weren\u2019t either. Asked how sick of it he was on a scale of one to 10, Valverde said 9.5.</p> \n<p>Barcelona offered PSG players in part-exchange, but didn\u2019t tell the players that. One was Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, another was Philippe Coutinho before he was loaned to Bayern Munich. The attempt to sell the players they bought to replace Neymar, at a cost greater than his, to buy the Brazilian back again was the perfect portrait of the whole sorry story.</p> \n<p>The sporting directors have rotated as much as the players, the latest happily heading off to Paris to chase a player he couldn\u2019t get. Meanwhile, the players flew east then west, preseason trumping the actual season. Then they came back and lost in Bilbao, which turned out to be just the start. Firpo fell down within a minute on his debut. The rest of them had been falling for far longer. \u201cWe have a long, hard season ahead of us,\u201d Luis Su\u00e1rez said on Saturday night, and he meant it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5032e76e-88a5-4ed6-8be6-347f31010a4e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Osasuna 0-0 Real Betis; Villarreal 2-0 Valladolid; Levante 0-0 Eibar; Atl\u00e9tico 0-0 Celta; Granada 2-0 Barcelona; Getafe 4-2 Mallorca; Espanyol 1-3 Real Sociedad; Valencia 1-1 Legan\u00e9s;<br>Athletic Bilbao 2-0 Alav\u00e9s; Sevilla 0-1 Real Madrid</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/23/inter-milan-derby-antonio-conte-marco-giampaolo\">Inter\u2019s perfect start is flattering but they are in better shape than Milan | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u2022 Zinedine Zidane did something even he hadn\u2019t done before: he took Real Madrid to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/sevilla-real-madrid-la- liga-match-report\" title=\"\">S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n and won</a>.

Now it was his turn and he kept returning to the same word: <em>solidaridad.</em> Whether it will work elsewhere is a different matter.

It was happening again, only faster. At Athletic Bilbao on the opening night, Barcelona had gone behind in the 89th minute; against Betis a week later, it was the 17th; and at Osasuna, the sixth. This time, in week five at Granada, they had only just made it to the second when Ramon Azeez scored. This time, they wouldn\u2019t make it out of trouble. As for Junior, signed from Real Betis for \u20ac18m in the summer, he didn\u2019t make it out for the second half. Lionel Messi did, at last making his first league appearance of the season, and so did Ansu Fati, their hope at 16. Even they couldn\u2019t salvage anything from this wreckage. Arturo Vidal came on too. Pretty much the first thing he did was boot the ball off. The second was stick a hand out in the area. From the penalty spot, \u00c1lvaro Vadillo made it 2-0. It was all over. And, it was tempting to conclude, even this early, all might actually mean all. Barcelona had been beaten. Barcelona are beaten, it seems. On the night when Granada, with a budget that couldn\u2019t pay Messi let alone everyone else at the Camp Nou, their salary cap 18 times lower than Barcelona\u2019s, deservedly won 2-0, the story should have been about them. What they had done was, in their manager\u2019s too-literally-translated words, \u201cbarbaric\u201d. It should have been about how 11 of their players on Saturday were in the second division while Barcelona won the league last season. About how they have lost just once, against Sevilla on their first home game back in primera, and won three in a row since without conceding. It should have been about how victory momentarily took them top. Granada. Top. But it wasn\u2019t. And not just because Diego Mart\u00ednez, their manager, insisted that looking at the league was a \u201cwaste of time\u201d. Or even because the story almost never is about them when it can be about them. It was because there was something about the way Barcelona were defeated, the way it managed to shock and not shock at all, that ran deeper. This wasn\u2019t just one game, and certainly wasn\u2019t just two men \u2013 still less Junior or Vidal, or even just Ernesto Valverde \u2013 however bad it had been. And, boy, had it been bad. It was difficult to remember a performance worse than this, and yet there was no lack of contenders. This was sudden; it was also a long time coming. Dreadful in defence, in midfield, up front. Nothing worked. \u201cNot even with Messi,\u201d ran the cover of AS, and there was something telling in that too. On Friday morning, El Mundo Deportivo gleefully splashed on Real Madrid in crisis. By the following night, it was Barcelona who were. And by the night after, Madrid were top. \u201cThis Barcelona lies in ruins,\u201d AS\u2019s headline ran. \u201cAnother disaster,\u201d El Mundo Deportivo said. At the end, Frenkie De Jong approached the fans and apologised. He must have wondered where he had ended up. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. \u201cFor Barcelona, every stadium is Anfield now,\u201d wrote Santi Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cThey are a drama of epic proportions, where anyone can strip them bare with startling ease.\u201d Something broke that night. Or maybe it\u2019s more accurate to suggest that something was revealed, and has not been remedied. They carried on regardless, reluctant to challenge the old order. But once it had happened it was more likely to happen again, a recurring nightmare. Rome resurfaced in Liverpool, and Liverpool resurfaces anywhere: Bilbao, Pamplona, Granada, Dortmund. The Camp Nou is one thing but Barcelona haven\u2019t won away since April. \u201cI am responsible,\u201d Valverde said. He meant for Saturday night but there\u2019s more. It is early, but it is their worst start in 25 years, and for all the coincidences \u2013 injuries, penalties, daft individual mistakes \u2013 it isn\u2019t entirely coincidental. They\u2019ve trailed in four of their five games and conceded in all of them. No one in La Liga has conceded more goals. And this is more than that old, facile line about how Barcelona can\u2019t defend: they can\u2019t attack either. At Granada, they had one shot on target. Sure, they have been without Messi, Su\u00e1rez, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Neymar too, but it\u2019s not about that either; it\u2019s about the most basic thing of all, the essence of Barcelona, perhaps hidden behind Messi for too long: the play. Against Liverpool, there was something deeper than defeat. That this is a team losing its religion is an old debate, politicised and exaggerated: Barcelona have been the best team in Spain by miles over the last two years. For all the flaws, Anfield remains hard to explain. Nor were they as heretical, as un-Bar\u00e7a as some accusations had it. But there is something in it, in the lack of a structure, an idea, a commitment to an identity. It has been hard to avoid the feeling that too few of those that mattered, manager included, believed in the model. Slowly, football slipped from them. Xavi and Iniesta have gone. Messi is too often the team \u2013 a process in which he may not be entirely blameless \u2013 and one day, he will be gone too. That has created a kind of desperation. After the defeat in Liverpool, Valverde\u2019s time appeared to have come to a close, but it didn\u2019t. It is hard to see how you can recover from a moment like that. There\u2019s a feeling this is a season too far \u2013 two seasons too far, some critics insist. There are parallels to Guardiola\u2019s fourth season and Luis Enrique\u2019s third. Defeat brought opportunity, a chance to reset. But they carried on; Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president, backed Valverde and some players did too: they were comfortable. Too comfortable. Valverde stands accused of allowing it. The decline went largely unchallenged. It is not that Barcelona are bad so much as that they\u2019re nothing in particular. De Jong came, someone to reinforce the model, but not always in his place: he has played too wide or not at all. The men alongside him have changed. There have been five different lineups in six weeks. Antoine Griezmann arrived, a year late. He has two positions: one is Messi\u2019s, the other is Su\u00e1rez\u2019s. The welcome was cold; those two wanted Neymar instead. Barcelona pursued the Brazilian publicly, driven by the president. They didn\u2019t sign him, but he cost them. The players who wanted him weren\u2019t happy, Messi among them, and the players that didn\u2019t weren\u2019t either. Asked how sick of it he was on a scale of one to 10, Valverde said 9.5. Barcelona offered PSG players in part-exchange, but didn\u2019t tell the players that. One was Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, another was Philippe Coutinho before he was loaned to Bayern Munich. The attempt to sell the players they bought to replace Neymar, at a cost greater than his, to buy the Brazilian back again was the perfect portrait of the whole sorry story. The sporting directors have rotated as much as the players, the latest happily heading off to Paris to chase a player he couldn\u2019t get. Meanwhile, the players flew east then west, preseason trumping the actual season. Then they came back and lost in Bilbao, which turned out to be just the start. Firpo fell down within a minute on his debut. The rest of them had been falling for far longer. \u201cWe have a long, hard season ahead of us,\u201d Luis Su\u00e1rez said on Saturday night, and he meant it. Talking points \u2022 Zinedine Zidane did something even he hadn\u2019t done before: he took Real Madrid to the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n and won. The last time they won 1-0 there, he was playing. It wasn\u2019t sparkling, but it didn\u2019t have to be; they just needed the victory and Zidane, under pressure, needed it most of all. \u201cA lot\u2019s been said,\u201d the Frenchman noted. Now it was his turn and he kept returning to the same word: solidaridad. Whether it will work elsewhere is a different matter. As Jorge Valdano put it on Sunday night: \u201cWhat Madrid did today they can\u2019t keep doing: Hazard, Bale and James will have to go forward, not defend at the back.\u201d \u2022 \u201cAgua, agua.\u201d Kieran Trippier needed a drink, so someone in the south end threw him a bottle. He took a swig and threw it back. A thumbs up and there was applause. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fans have really taken to him. Trippier has provided more deliveries into the box than anyone else in the Atl\u00e9tico side, but this time it was not enough: they couldn\u2019t find a way past Celta. \u2022 \u201cPeter Lim, go home\u201d read the banner at Mestalla, where a 1-1 draw was played out to protests against the owner. At one point, fans chanted the name of sacked manager Marcelino. Rodrigo wagged his finger; he loved Marcelino more than anyone, but now was the time to get behind the new coach, he explained afterwards. When the supporters chanted his name instead, he applauded. \u2022 Athletic are top for the first time since the opening day of 2005-06. Unbeaten, only one goal conceded in five, they\u2019re now unbeaten in 17 at home and this is their best start in 25 years.",

The US has never returned to the pre-GFC peak; Australia is now well above it: Recessions not only wreck the economy and lives; they utterly change society. One way to look at this is to observe the change that recessions have on the work of men in their 40s \u2013 that age when usually they have children and are nearing the peak of their earning ability. The 1982 and 1990s recessions and the GFC saw falls in the percentage of men in their 40s in employment, from peaks that have never again been reached: For men in their 40s working full-time, the impact is even more stark: When the 1990s recession hit, 85.4% of men in their 40s were working full-time.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Recessions, of course, also hit household living standards. And yet here is a case where we do not really need to experience a recession to find out what it would be like. As I have noted, the gross household disposable income per capita is now back at 2011 levels \u2013 and has been falling since the September 2014 peak: That is actually rather like a recession. The only difference is that the fall is generally faster and sharper in recessions. In the second half of the 1970s household disposable income fell 3.5% in real terms before recovering to the pre-recession peak after two and half years. The 1982-83 recession saw a 2.8% fall but only a year and half to recover. The 1990s recession was hell. Household incomes fell 3.5% from the pre-recession peak and took four years to recover. But right now we are nearly five years away from September 2012 levels. We have not seen a sharp fall in living standards, but instead a long slow slump, with no sign of recovery. A recession now would utterly destroy any change of returning to the living standards of 2012. We don\u2019t need a recession, take it from me \u2013 they are horrific things, and anyone suggesting they are needed should do everyone a favour and remove themselves from public discussion. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "New South Wales has been secretly exploring a highly controversial plan to turn the state\u2019s coastal rivers inland to provide more water for irrigators and towns in the west of the state. The proposal, put forward by WaterNSW, echoes the plan for turning rivers inland first mooted by John Bradfield, the engineer who designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, in 1938. He was unable to convince government of its merits before he died in 1943. But the idea appears to have new currency. The NSW proposals are revealed in a freedom of information request made by the Guardian. The documents show significant work has been done on at least four projects involving pumping water from coastal rivers over the Great Dividing Range to replenish western NSW rivers, which are in the grip of a drought. The main focus of work in NSW has been on turning the headwaters of the Clarence inland via a network of pipes and pumps to feed it into headwaters of the Border rivers system. But there has also been work done on diverting flows from the Manning, Macleay and Hunter rivers inland. Many of the documents were withheld from the Guardian, on the grounds it would impede WaterNSW\u2019s work on the projects, but the schedule of documents shows there has already been significant work, including hydrological studies and discussions with irrigators in western NSW. The idea of turning the coastal rivers inland instead of letting them run \u201cwastefully\u201d into the sea has been floated during almost every drought. The Guardian was provided with detailed studies of projects from 1981 and 1982 as part of the request. These appear to be informing the current work inside WaterNSW. Brief mentions of the options were also included in a public version of WaterNSW\u2019s 20 year Infrastructure Options Study for Rural Valleys released in 2018. But in recent months the idea has gained currency within some elements of WaterNSW and is being championed by populist politicians such as the Nationals\u2019 Barnaby Joyce, One Nation\u2019s Mark Latham and radio announcers, such as Alan Jones. In the past, cost and unknown environmental impacts on coastal fisheries, agriculture and tourism have weighed against such a project. $6bn+ price tag According to the WaterNSW documents, the capital cost of the four projects under study is well north of $6bn. The environmental concerns are likely to be complex. The mouth of the Clarence is one of the state\u2019s richest prawn fisheries and the impact of diverting as much as 7% to 10% of freshwater flows is unknown. Just last month oyster farmers in the Shoalhaven expressed their concerns about a NSW government decision to begin transfers from the upper Shoalhaven to Sydney\u2019s dams early, warning the lack of freshwater flushes could endanger their oyster crops. The projects would be extremely unpopular in coastal communities. Maps obtained by the Guardian dated January 2016 detail a number of options. A proposal, marked with the word \u201cFocus\u201d, for the Clarence involves taking water out of its northern tributaries such as Morgans creek, the Cataract river and existing reservoirs on Timbarra river and redirecting it westward into the Border rivers system through a series of tunnels, pipes and existing creeks. The water would need to be pumped up to cross the Great Dividing Range before joining the Severn and McIntyre rivers in the west. It was costed at $975m. Another project involves taking water out of the Aberfoyle river, which feeds into the Clarence, to send it south-west to the Gwydir river and Copeton dam. It was costed at $1.8bn. Another network of pipes is proposed to send water from the headwaters of the Macleay river north of Armidale, west into the headwaters of the Namoi and Keepit dam. It had a price tag of $2.35bn. The Namoi flows through Gunnedah, Narrabri, Wee Waa and Walgett, one of the major cotton-growing districts. Keepit dam is currently at less than 1% capacity and several of these towns face running out of water by June next year. A fourth project, costed at $765m, involves sending water from the Barnard river, which flows into the Manning on the east coast over the divide to the Chaffey dam on the Peel river. The Peel flows through Tamworth, which is also in danger of running out of water. Most documents requested by the Guardian were withheld because they would impede WaterNSW in their deliberations. But the few documents that were released show WaterNSW was discussing the projects with irrigators in western NSW last year and commissioned hydrological analysis for some projects in 2019. An April 2019 analysis found that around 11-44GL could be diverted to the Peel, assuming 30% of the flows were left in the Barnard. The diversion from the Macleay into the Namoi would yield about 3-18GL a year, assuming 50% take from the headwaters of the Macleay. One GL is approximately 444 Olympic swimming pools. A spokesman for WaterNSW said the organisation had assessed \u201chundreds of infrastructure options, including options involving the possibility of moving some coastal river flow inland\u201d. \u201cLike dozens of other infrastructure options explored, the concept of such inter-basin transfers would require further extensive, detailed study before being more seriously contemplated,\u201d he said. \u201cWaterNSW has not received funding from Government to initiate or explore these options any further at this time,\u201d he said. \u2018An expensive gift to irrigators\u2019 Jack Gough, a policy researcher at the Nature Conservation Council, said the proposal was fundamentally flawed. \u201cTransferring water between catchments would be an expensive gift to a handful of irrigators and mines at the expense of communities on the coast and the environment. \u201cIt does not address the fundamental problem, which is the government has over-allocated water to irrigators and failed to include the impacts of climate change in its modelling.\u201d The projects are not among the NSW government\u2019s list of projects for which it is seeking federal funding at this stage. A second, far more ambitious project is also being touted by the private sector in Canberra. A company, Australian Infrastructure Solutions, has proposed taking 13% of the Burdekin river in Queensland and sending it down a 2,000km inland canal which would feed into the headwaters of several inland rivers. The project, with a ballpark costing of $9bn, is said to be capable of delivering another 1,000GL of water to inland farmers. This equates to nearly 20% of the amount of water available in the Murray-Darling river system. Support our independent journalism with a one-off or recurring contribution",

      "bodyText": "Labor will oppose a government push to expand the controversial cashless welfare card and extend existing trial sites, saying it will only support income management if the scheme is made voluntary. Labor\u2019s hardening opposition to the card, which it initially supported in trial communities, comes as the Northern Territory\u2019s peak body for Aboriginal organisations likened the \u201cunwarranted haste\u201d of the cashless debit card push in the territory to the \u201cdisastrous and ill advised imposition\u201d of the 2007 intervention. As part of the Coalition\u2019s revived \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d welfare agenda, the government has introduced legislation to expand the card to Cape York and the NT, where it will replace the basics card, and extend existing sites in Ceduna in South Australia, the East Kimberley and Goldfields in Western Australia, and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland. Without an extension being granted by parliament, the existing trial sites are due to expire in June next year. Under the scheme that has been operating since 2016, up to 80% of a person\u2019s welfare is quarantined to a bank card that cannot be spent on alcohol or gambling, but the new legislation allows the minister to restrict 100% of payments in some circumstances. Labor\u2019s shadow minister for families and social services, Linda Burney, said the opposition would propose two amendments to the legislation, one to make the program voluntary and a second to ensure a proper and independent inquiry into the effectiveness of the card. But unless the government agrees to make the card optional for welfare recipients, Labor will vote against it. \u201cThe amendments Labor will propose directly address concerns raised by the government itself in relation to the ineffectiveness of indiscriminate compulsory income management like the cashless debit card,\u201d Burney said. \u201cPeople have raised with us serious questions about the card. \u201cWe are not against the card when it is voluntary, or when properly targeted in instances such as family violence and child protection.\u201d Labor\u2019s opposition to the card\u2019s expansion comes as John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory, told a Senate hearing in Darwin on Monday that the roll-out would not work. \u201cThe unwarranted haste of imposing the cashless welfare card on our communities recalls for us the disastrous and ill advised imposition of the intervention,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cIt is evident that income management has failed, yet the government is intent on continuing to try to further coerce us into change by further extending the policy. It simply will not work,\u201d added Paterson, who also leads the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory. The inquiry also heard competing views on the card from a number of Aboriginal corporations. Robert Totten, a manager at the Maningrida Progress Association, said about 50% of its turnover at its retailers and other businesses came from the basics card. He said the card had improved \u201cthe wellbeing of families\u201d. But Liam Flanagan, the general manager of community services at the Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation, said income management had brought shame and hopelessness. The Human Rights Law Centre senior solicitor Adrianne Walters said the bill allowed the government to increase the rate of welfare quarantining for people on the cashless debit card to 100% without new legislation. She said this provision handed too much power to the minister. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Coalition senators told the hearing that the rate of quarantining would only change if the community requested it. Without the support of Labor and the Greens, the government will need to secure the support of four Senate crossbenchers for the expansion to come into effect. The Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie and Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie will travel to Ceduna this weekend to talk to participants on the ground about the card before declaring their final position. Both Lambie and Centre Alliance \u2013 which was formerly known as the Nick Xenophon Team \u2013 have previously supported the welfare quarantining trials. But Sharkie, the welfare spokesperson for Centre Alliance which controls two Senate votes, told Guardian Australia she was unlikely to support the card before new analysis of the program promised by the government was released. \u201cI am pretty reluctant to do more with the cashless debit card until we know whether it is working,\u201d Sharkie said. She also said she was concerned that the legislation could include a \u201cback door\u201d that might allow the government to roll the card out nationwide. While Lambie is broadly in favour of the cashless debit card, a spokeswoman for the Tasmanian senator said she did not support a nationwide roll-out and thought \u201ctweaks\u201d to how the card operated were needed. A spokeswoman for the social services minister, Anne Ruston, said the government was committed to finding the best ways to support people, families and communities in places where high levels of welfare dependence co-exist with high levels of social harm. \u201cThat is why we are seeking parliamentary approval to extend the existing trials until 30 June 2021 and to transition the 23,000 Australians on the basics card in the NT and Cape York to the cashless debit card,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cashless debit card provides greater consumer choice and autonomy while reducing red tape for businesses because the vast majority with Eftpos facilities can automatically accept the card. \u201cFor these reasons the Government encourages Labor to support the bill as it was introduced to the House.\u201d A government-commissioned report released last year found the card had been effective in \u201creducing alcohol consumption and gambling\u201d in Ceduna and the East Kimberley, with almost half of people who identified themselves as gamblers doing so less. Among drug takers, 48% self-reported using illegal drugs less often. But despite some positive improvements, only 17% reported feeling their lives were better as a result of the card, and 24% of parents reported their children\u2019s lives were actually worse.",

Areas of greater western Sydney were often known as areas of exclusion. But what we see now is that [it\u2019s] a patchwork of classes.\u201d</p> <p>He says there are pockets of inequality and privilege on either side of the line. \u201cThe Red Rooster line, or the latte line, provides us with some insight but it\u2019s also a very simplified way of looking at it. What it allows people to do is create this really superficial, straw man understanding of what people are like in these different parts of Sydney.\u201d</p> <p>And while El Jannah\u2019s move might be particularly high-profile, it\u2019s hardly the first time the Harbour City\u2019s neighbourhoods have changed face. \u201cPeople have been embracing different cultures across Sydney for the last 10 or 20 years,\u201d Arvanitakis says. \u201cIf you look at Randwick, it has a number of restaurants that were originally established in Fairfield or Parramatta. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything new. Maybe it\u2019s just been happening a little bit below the radar.\u201d</p> <p>There are still a few weeks until El Jannah cuts the ribbon on its Newtown store.

But the chicken purveyor says demand came from well beyond its home turf. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of patrons who tell us they came all the way from the eastern side of Sydney,\u201d El Jannah\u2019s business development manager, Tony Nahas, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cSo we\u2019ve answered the call.\u201d The chain opening in Newtown might also be a reminder that the city is not as segregated as it\u2019s made out to be. \u201cI think, actually, Sydney is a pretty integrated city compared to other places,\u201d James Arvanitakis, a social and cultural analysis professor at Western Sydney University, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIf we were having this conversation a generation ago, you would say Sydney is incredibly class-divided. Areas of greater western Sydney were often known as areas of exclusion. But what we see now is that [it\u2019s] a patchwork of classes.\u201d He says there are pockets of inequality and privilege on either side of the line. \u201cThe Red Rooster line, or the latte line, provides us with some insight but it\u2019s also a very simplified way of looking at it. What it allows people to do is create this really superficial, straw man understanding of what people are like in these different parts of Sydney.\u201d And while El Jannah\u2019s move might be particularly high-profile, it\u2019s hardly the first time the Harbour City\u2019s neighbourhoods have changed face. \u201cPeople have been embracing different cultures across Sydney for the last 10 or 20 years,\u201d Arvanitakis says. \u201cIf you look at Randwick, it has a number of restaurants that were originally established in Fairfield or Parramatta. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything new. Maybe it\u2019s just been happening a little bit below the radar.\u201d There are still a few weeks until El Jannah cuts the ribbon on its Newtown store. When that happens, Sydney will have to find a new metaphor for its divisions, or a more subtle way of understanding them.",

In an unlikely turn of events, the Duchess of Sussex has outed herself as a bargain-lover. Arriving at the wedding of the designer Misha Nonoo and the oil and gas heir Mikey Hess in Rome last week, the duchess wore a black Valentino gown accessorised with a pair of \u00a35 earrings borrowed from a friend who picked them up on a stall on Portobello Road in London.</p> <p>The sensation of walking out of a car-boot sale or charity shop with an absolute bargain is among the greatest of nature\u2019s highs. \u201cMy heart stopped when I picked it up,\u201d remembers Isabelle O\u2019Carroll of the moment she found a Burberry trenchcoat priced at \u00a36 in a Brighton charity shop. \u201cWhen you spot a bargain like that, time stands still,\u201d says the 37-year-old writer from London. \u201cI did a little internal backflip.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8e5ceea4effea476c64968f50881271ab05e1e03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e5ceea4effea476c64968f50881271ab05e1e03/0_0_338_423/338.jpg\" alt=\"Sian Norris and her YSL dress.\" width=\"338\" height=\"423\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sian Norris and her YSL dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes, the euphoria is tempered with guilt. One 20-year-old student, Alessandro Koehler from Rome, once found a Helmut Lang denim jacket at a street stall for 50 cents. \u201cI felt as if I was on top of the world,\u201d Koehler says, \u201cbut also like I scammed the guy.\u201d Most of the time, you pick up bargains when people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re selling. A 35-year-old journalist, Sian Norris from Bristol, bought a label-less tea-dress on eBay for \u00a327. When it arrived, she realised it was covered in the YSL monogram print. \u201cYou can tell it\u2019s good quality,\u201d Norris says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much fabric in the skirt.\u201d A 29-year-old podcaster, Riley Quinn, once found a pair of black, calf-length Herm\u00e8s boots for \u00a320 in a consignment store in Angel, north London. He gave them to a friend. \u201cI have no idea why they were so cheap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m addicted to charity shops,\u201d says 24-year-old charity worker Jess Midwinter, who once picked up a 99p Moschino shirt from a charity shop in her home town of Swindon. \u201cI make a big deal of going to all of them. You\u2019re guaranteed to find good things if you keep it up.\u201d Visiting charity shops in wealthy areas is a good bet: when 34-year-old Joanne Gould, from Golders Green in north London, was on maternity leave, she would tour the local charity shops with her pram looking for steals. \u201cI\u2019d find loads of amazing stuff,\u201d she says, such as a black Marc Jacobs dress she bought for \u00a318. Gould also found a red Versace dress on eBay, for \u00a320. \u201cMy friends couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e3191a62e683ffd2a0d0bdbac3b3d18fbbf77bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e3191a62e683ffd2a0d0bdbac3b3d18fbbf77bd/103_129_125_157/125.jpg\" alt=\"Jess Midwinter and her Moschino shirt.\" width=\"125\" height=\"157\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jess Midwinter and her Moschino shirt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes, a vintage find feels like fate. Once, 23-year-old Annalisa Savi, a student from Italy, was in a charity shop in Walthamstow, north London, when she unearthed a white silk Armani jacket for \u00a37.50. Peering at it, Savi realised it was identical to the jacket her mother wore at her own wedding. \u201cI was like, oh my God.\u201d Savi wears the jacket to interviews when she needs some good luck \u2013 she was wearing it the day she met her boyfriend. \u201cI think it works!\u201d</p>",

Was that a Versace miniskirt for \u2026 \u00a32.50? \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to buy this before anyone realises.\u2019\u201d Anomie, an artist from Bexhill in Sussex, took it home then sold it for \u00a375 on her shopping app Depop. \u201cI probably underpriced it,\u201d Anomie says. Many of us have friends who are charity-shop pros; masters of the bargain bin; emperors of the kilo sale. In an unlikely turn of events, the Duchess of Sussex has outed herself as a bargain-lover. Arriving at the wedding of the designer Misha Nonoo and the oil and gas heir Mikey Hess in Rome last week, the duchess wore a black Valentino gown accessorised with a pair of \u00a35 earrings borrowed from a friend who picked them up on a stall on Portobello Road in London. The sensation of walking out of a car-boot sale or charity shop with an absolute bargain is among the greatest of nature\u2019s highs. \u201cMy heart stopped when I picked it up,\u201d remembers Isabelle O\u2019Carroll of the moment she found a Burberry trenchcoat priced at \u00a36 in a Brighton charity shop. \u201cWhen you spot a bargain like that, time stands still,\u201d says the 37-year-old writer from London. \u201cI did a little internal backflip.\u201d Sometimes, the euphoria is tempered with guilt. One 20-year-old student, Alessandro Koehler from Rome, once found a Helmut Lang denim jacket at a street stall for 50 cents. \u201cI felt as if I was on top of the world,\u201d Koehler says, \u201cbut also like I scammed the guy.\u201d Most of the time, you pick up bargains when people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re selling. A 35-year-old journalist, Sian Norris from Bristol, bought a label-less tea-dress on eBay for \u00a327. When it arrived, she realised it was covered in the YSL monogram print. \u201cYou can tell it\u2019s good quality,\u201d Norris says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much fabric in the skirt.\u201d A 29-year-old podcaster, Riley Quinn, once found a pair of black, calf-length Herm\u00e8s boots for \u00a320 in a consignment store in Angel, north London. He gave them to a friend. \u201cI have no idea why they were so cheap.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m addicted to charity shops,\u201d says 24-year-old charity worker Jess Midwinter, who once picked up a 99p Moschino shirt from a charity shop in her home town of Swindon. \u201cI make a big deal of going to all of them. You\u2019re guaranteed to find good things if you keep it up.\u201d Visiting charity shops in wealthy areas is a good bet: when 34-year-old Joanne Gould, from Golders Green in north London, was on maternity leave, she would tour the local charity shops with her pram looking for steals. \u201cI\u2019d find loads of amazing stuff,\u201d she says, such as a black Marc Jacobs dress she bought for \u00a318. Gould also found a red Versace dress on eBay, for \u00a320. \u201cMy friends couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Sometimes, a vintage find feels like fate. Once, 23-year-old Annalisa Savi, a student from Italy, was in a charity shop in Walthamstow, north London, when she unearthed a white silk Armani jacket for \u00a37.50. Peering at it, Savi realised it was identical to the jacket her mother wore at her own wedding. \u201cI was like, oh my God.\u201d Savi wears the jacket to interviews when she needs some good luck \u2013 she was wearing it the day she met her boyfriend. \u201cI think it works!\u201d",

Successive attempts to address this problem have failed to grasp the true causes which are, depressingly, characterised by the report of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/27/leaked-documents-reveal-tories-dramatic-plans-for-schools\" title=\"\">leaked government document</a> advocating swapping \u201cworkload-inducing practices for evidence-based approaches\u201d.</p> <p>This, like all the other initiatives, is an attempt to shift the responsibility for this matter on to schools, thereby exacerbating the problem it was designed to solve. Headteachers have a good deal of autonomy and high levels of accountability. While schools face the challenges of high-stakes assessments of a curriculum which is, in part, unsuitable for many children, headteachers, who can, and do, lose their jobs over this, will not countenance a drop in workload for their staff. All of this dates from the time spent at the Department for Education by Michael Gove and the ubiquitous Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>The government must take the lead through a loosening of this draconian, inappropriate, formulaic, stress-inducing curriculum and its \u201cdo or die\u201d assessment regime in primary and secondary schools, and find some vision. It must also rationalise the impact of the government\u2019s kneejerk requirements for schools to mend society every time there is a negative report or event. We want our children to be educated, but we also want them to be happy, safe, fulfilled and valued \u2013 and we don\u2019t want exhausted, anxious teachers struggling to tick the boxes every day.</p> <p>Unfortunately we have a poor excuse for a government that can\u2019t even respect democracy. Solving this problem is beyond them.<br><strong>David Lowndes</strong><br><em>Soberton, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Unlike many other occupations, teaching is never-ending. There is always more to do and higher expectations to meet. The fact that many teachers are perfectionists doesn\u2019t help either. Most teachers have always worked hard, and willingly, but until fairly recently it\u2019s been on matters they considered important to their sense of professionalism. They see the current raft of accountability demands as not only unrealistic and bureaucratic but as demeaning, demoralising and stress-inducing.</p> <p>Small wonder that too many are seriously considering leaving the profession because of excessive, anti-educative workloads. Recent governments, the Department for Education and Ofsted have much to answer for, and much to do, to restore teacher morale and wellbeing and to staunch a near-fatal professional haemorrhaging.<br><strong>Prof</strong><strong> Colin Richards</strong><br><em>Spark Bridge, Cumbria</em></p> <p>\u2022 Why is it that, while Finnish teenagers have for over two decades outstripped English students in international literacy, numeracy and science assessments, on average teachers in Finland work almost a third fewer hours than their counterparts in England (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/18/25-of-teachers-in-england-work-more-than-60-hours-a-week-study\" title=\"\">Quarter of teachers in England work 60 hours a week</a>, 18 September)?</p> <p>Perhaps our government needs to better understand why, despite far greater teacher input, English students consistently lag behind those from Finland and other nations, before launching yet more initiatives aimed at reducing teacher workload. One possible explanation might be that the \u201chigh-stakes\u201d accountability of schools in this country, with its incessant testing of children and \u201cdo or die\u201d inspections, places such a burden on teachers that a fifth leave within five years of starting.</p> <p>This mass exodus creates one of the youngest and least experienced teaching workforces in the developed world. Nevertheless, the government\u2019s cascade of initiatives have wrongly put the responsibility for solving the workload problem on schools and teachers, rather than on doing something about the corrosive testing and inspection regime, which adds little to children\u2019s learning, and is not part of school life in Finland and many other high-performing countries.<br><strong>Chris Pratt</strong><br><em>Author, Building a Learning Nation</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Your editorial (19 September) begins to unpick some of the reasons why retention and, in some areas, recruitment are such a problem in this beleaguered and overwhelmed profession. Successive attempts to address this problem have failed to grasp the true causes which are, depressingly, characterised by the report of the leaked government document advocating swapping \u201cworkload-inducing practices for evidence-based approaches\u201d. This, like all the other initiatives, is an attempt to shift the responsibility for this matter on to schools, thereby exacerbating the problem it was designed to solve. Headteachers have a good deal of autonomy and high levels of accountability. While schools face the challenges of high-stakes assessments of a curriculum which is, in part, unsuitable for many children, headteachers, who can, and do, lose their jobs over this, will not countenance a drop in workload for their staff. All of this dates from the time spent at the Department for Education by Michael Gove and the ubiquitous Dominic Cummings. The government must take the lead through a loosening of this draconian, inappropriate, formulaic, stress-inducing curriculum and its \u201cdo or die\u201d assessment regime in primary and secondary schools, and find some vision. It must also rationalise the impact of the government\u2019s kneejerk requirements for schools to mend society every time there is a negative report or event. We want our children to be educated, but we also want them to be happy, safe, fulfilled and valued \u2013 and we don\u2019t want exhausted, anxious teachers struggling to tick the boxes every day. Unfortunately we have a poor excuse for a government that can\u2019t even respect democracy. Solving this problem is beyond them. David Lowndes Soberton, Hampshire \u2022 Unlike many other occupations, teaching is never-ending. There is always more to do and higher expectations to meet. The fact that many teachers are perfectionists doesn\u2019t help either. Most teachers have always worked hard, and willingly, but until fairly recently it\u2019s been on matters they considered important to their sense of professionalism. They see the current raft of accountability demands as not only unrealistic and bureaucratic but as demeaning, demoralising and stress-inducing. Small wonder that too many are seriously considering leaving the profession because of excessive, anti-educative workloads. Recent governments, the Department for Education and Ofsted have much to answer for, and much to do, to restore teacher morale and wellbeing and to staunch a near-fatal professional haemorrhaging. Prof Colin Richards Spark Bridge, Cumbria \u2022 Why is it that, while Finnish teenagers have for over two decades outstripped English students in international literacy, numeracy and science assessments, on average teachers in Finland work almost a third fewer hours than their counterparts in England (Quarter of teachers in England work 60 hours a week, 18 September)? Perhaps our government needs to better understand why, despite far greater teacher input, English students consistently lag behind those from Finland and other nations, before launching yet more initiatives aimed at reducing teacher workload. One possible explanation might be that the \u201chigh-stakes\u201d accountability of schools in this country, with its incessant testing of children and \u201cdo or die\u201d inspections, places such a burden on teachers that a fifth leave within five years of starting. This mass exodus creates one of the youngest and least experienced teaching workforces in the developed world. Nevertheless, the government\u2019s cascade of initiatives have wrongly put the responsibility for solving the workload problem on schools and teachers, rather than on doing something about the corrosive testing and inspection regime, which adds little to children\u2019s learning, and is not part of school life in Finland and many other high-performing countries.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s family business is expected to win approval to build a second golf course on his Aberdeenshire estate, more than a decade after it was first promised. Local councillors are expected to rubberstamp the proposal on Tuesday after it was endorsed by Aberdeenshire\u2019s planning officers, days before the council votes on a far more controversial bid by the Trump Organization to build 550 luxury homes nearby. The new 18-hole course, to be named MacLeod course after Trump\u2019s mother Mary, will sit alongside the first loss-making championship course that opened at Menie north of Aberdeen in 2012. Trump has also owned the Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire since 2014. Local community councillors believe the MacLeod course will benefit the area by boosting tourism, and help it recover from a slump caused by the collapse in oil prices, which hit Aberdeen\u2019s North Sea oil and gas industries. But critics are doubtful about the course\u2019s viability and believe it can only be funded by the construction and sale of the 550 luxury and holiday homes, which councillors will be voting on at a separate meeting on Thursday. The properties are expected to cost about \u00a320m to build, with the largest one expected to sell for more than \u00a31m each. The existing course and boutique hotel at MacLeod House have consistently lost money since they opened. Local people say the championship course, which closes for five months during the winter and is hit regularly by bad weather during the summer, is routinely empty. The latest accounts for the Trump International Golf Club Scotland show the business lost more than \u00a31m in 2017 on a turnover of \u00a32.5m, with the downturn cutting its income by 3% that year. Its survival is dependent on historic loans from President Trump totalling \u00a340m and a top-up loan in 2017 of \u00a31.3m from the DJT Holdings LLC, the parent company which also owns various other Trump Organization companies. But DJT Holdings LLC is under investigation by US prosecutors probing allegations Trump\u2019s firms have profited from his presidency, although the inquiry is not thought to include his Aberdeenshire resort. The two golf courses were given outline planning permission in 2008 as part of Trump\u2019s plans for a \u00a3750m golfing resort featuring an eight-storey five-star hotel, timeshare flats, conference centre, spa golfing academy, shops and sports facilities. None of those are expected to be built. That scheme floundered after the banking crisis, leaving critics of the scheme furious. The project involved the removal or remodelling of a large area of rare mobile dunes, which were legally protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). In June, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)announced it would strip the dunes of their SSSI designation. Among 15 conditions attached to the second golf course scheme, Aberdeenshire has told the Trump Organization it must have environment and habitat management plans for the site to protect its dunes, badgers and otters, and an outdoor access plan to protect public rights of way. David Wallace, the chairman of Belhelvie community council, which includes the nearby village of Balmedie,expressed concerns about construction traffic clogging up local roads while the new course and housing were under construction. The resort had originally been due to have a new road and junction, which was not being built.

      "body": "<p>If one credits the title of his autobiography from 1999 \u2013 Where Did It All Go Right? \u2013 the word that best sums up the life of the writer, poet and critic Al Alvarez is \u201cluck\u201d. There is, however, a more appropriate four-letter word for the life he chose to live: \u201crisk\u201d. Not for him the percentage game. Alvarez, who has died aged 90 of viral pneumonia, confronted risk head-on in his favoured recreations \u2013 rock-climbing and poker \u2013 and in his career as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/08/poetry.highereducation\" title=\"\">an academic without a permanent post</a>.</p> <p>Alvarez was also, he claimed, a man without full nationality. \u201cI am a Londoner, heart and soul,\u201d he protested, \u201cbut not quite an Englishman.\u201d His Sephardic Jewish family had been resident in the country for 200 years. Enriched in the clothing trade on the side of his father, Bertie, and property on that of his mother, Katie (nee Levy), they had been assimilated for generations. Although they were no longer quite as rich as they had been by the time Al was born, the family\u2019s mansion in Hampstead, north London, retained a full complement of servants and a high level of cultivation. Classical music was, Al said, one of the great joys of his life even if, like his father, he could play nothing but the gramophone.</p> <p>Al went to <a href=\"https://www.oundleschool.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Oundle school</a> in Northamptonshire. A brilliant pupil and a pugnacious sportsman, he excelled but narrowly escaped expulsion in his last year for wilfully breaking rules. In 1949 he went as a scholar to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to read English. There, with like-minded rebels, he founded the Critical Society, whose manifesto opened: \u201cIn Oxford current literary criticism is both vague and ineffective.\u201d Alvarez would be saying something along those lines all his life.</p> <p>He took a first \u2013 the first undergraduate to do so in English at his college. But he disdained the conventional academic career his achievement made possible. He couldn\u2019t take the \u201chigh-table chat\u201d, he would airily explain. In more serious mood he felt that English, as practised at Oxbridge, was like \u201cgeography\u201d \u2013 a discipline for the clever but not the brilliant.</p> <p>In his most serious mood Alvarez detected discreet institutional resistances. This was a period when Jews could find a niche in philosophy, as had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/08/100-best-nonfiction-books-isaiah-berlin-the-hedgehog-and-the-fox-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">Isaiah Berlin</a> (who got the first \u201cfirst\u201d ever in his subject at Corpus Christi), or physics, but not the \u201cnational\u201d subject. English was closed to the \u201cnot quite English\u201d.</p> <p>He chose to be an outsider. His adopted forename, \u201cAl\u201d, evokes the gunslinger rather than the Hampstead intellectual or the don. Free from \u201call that fiddle\u201d (a term he borrowed from the admired US poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/marianne-moore\" title=\"\">Marianne Moore</a>) he embarked on a career in which he would do more to shake up English studies from outside than he ever could have done as a company man.</p> <p>America recognised the authentic Al Alvarez quality early on. Before he was 30 he was invited to give the Gauss seminars on criticism at Princeton. As his longtime friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/18/sir-frank-kermode-obituary\" title=\"\">Frank Kermode</a> ruefully observed, he had felt lucky to get the invitation at 50. There followed two conventional books, The Shaping Spirit (1958), on modern British and US poets, and The School of Donne (1961). They were done, one felt, to show he could do it. Just as well and better than the high-table eunuchs.</p> <p>It pleased Alvarez to say that he made his first marriage, aged 16, to John Donne, on first reading <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/witchcraft.php\" title=\"\">Witchcraft by a Picture</a>. His first proper union was with <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lawrence-frieda-1879-1956\" title=\"\">Frieda Lawrence</a>\u2019s granddaughter Ursula Barr in 1956. It forged an apostolic line with an author with whom he was, at the time, besotted. DH Lawrence, he later felt, was a bad influence and the marriage \u201ca very bad marriage\u201d. The couple divorced five years later. In 1966 he married, lastingly, Anne Adams.</p> <p>As a rock-climber Alvarez was never in the first rank but, like Robert Graves, he wrote about the sport with a lyricism which better climbers could not aspire to. According to Matthew Norman, who played with him, he was a good poker player \u2013 but not world-class. Connoisseurship was Alvarez\u2019s line, not performance. He was, he said, the only literary critic who wrote bestselling books about risky things. He also turned out three novels over the years written, as he quipped, to remind himself that he wasn\u2019t a novelist.</p> <p>A poet he most certainly was. But he never achieved the reputation his admirers felt he warranted. He was too busy with other things to work single-mindedly on his own career. He did much for the careers of other poets and even more to reshape received ideas about the form. As poetry editor of the Observer (1956-66), he used the post as a bully-pulpit to raise British awareness of such hitherto unregarded American writers as Robert Lowell and John Berryman.</p> <p>His journalism fed into the polemic anthology <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-new-poetry-selected-and-introduced-by-a-alvarez-book-of-a-lifetime-a6713351.html\" title=\"\">The New Poetry</a> (1962). Alvarez\u2019s introduction opened with a declaration of war: \u201cThe London old boys\u2019 circuit can be stupid, parasitic and conceited.\u201d The mainstream of British poetry, he maintained, had been self-neutered by its deference to the \u201cgentility principle\u201d. He scornfully repudiated the \u201cschool of Hardy\u201d and its tame apostles, John Betjeman and Philip Larkin.</p> <p>Art, Alvarez asserted, was the product not of tepid Wordsworthian tranquillity, but the white heat of suffering, rage and self-destruction. It was a doctrine he labelled \u201cextremism\u201d. The New Poetry, he conceded, \u201cearned me a lot of enemies. I intended it that way; it was a kind of fuck them.\u201d It made the bestseller list and for Penguin (not Alvarez) much money.</p> <p>Alvarez extended his go-for-broke iconoclasm in a series of programmes for the BBC entitled Under Pressure in which he travelled to eastern Europe and returned a passionate advocate for the poetry and literature being produced there \u2013 despite totalitarian oppression. It was a theme with him thereafter that <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/zbigniew-herbert\" title=\"\">Zbigniew Herbert</a>\u2019s not winning the Nobel prize was scandalous. Stockholm, like London, was stupid.</p> <p>Ever restless, Alvarez enjoyed his greatest success with mid- and late-career books rooted in acute critical intelligence and raw personal experience \u2013 \u201cfully existential criticism\u201d he called it. The series kicked off with <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-savage-god-9781408842768/\" title=\"\">The Savage God</a> (1971), a meditation on literary suicide. Its learned conspectus ended with the personal recollection of his own aborted and Sylvia Plath\u2019s actual suicide.</p> <p>Both occurred at the period when their marriages were breaking up. If he did not actually make Plath\u2019s reputation as a poet, on the strength of her end-of-life \u201cextreme\u201d verse, Alvarez was its most effective proponent. They were personally close and he was among the last to see her alive. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/04/poetry.highereducation\" title=\"\">Despite the many accounts he gave</a> of the relationship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/26/there-is-no-reason-to-doubt-sylvia-plath-word\" title=\"\">its closeness has remained a matter of speculation</a>.</p> <p>The Savage God was another bestseller. Others in the \u201cfully existential\u201d genre were Life After Marriage (1982), a study of divorce; The Biggest Game in Town (1983), about poker in its capital city, Las Vegas; Offshore (1986), the record of a sojourn on a North Sea oil rig; and Feeding the Rat (1988), Alvarez\u2019s homage to heroic rock climbing.</p> <p>The self-exposure in these books was, even for Alvarez, risky. The London Review of Books gave his study of divorce to his first wife, Ursula, to review. The former Mrs Alvarez\u2019s scathing retort ended: \u201cI believe the description of himself, me, and of our marriage, to be a fiction. It is a pity he has neither the good taste, nor the talent, to present it as such.\u201d</p> <p>Friends were indignant on Alvarez\u2019s behalf. He himself merely observed that in a divorce \u201ceveryone behaves badly\u201d. Truth, he seemed to imply, might sometimes be a casualty.</p> <p>He lived his last years where he had begun, in Hampstead. John le Carr\u00e9, a fond visitor, described Alvarez at home as \u201can impassioned husband and a family man\u201d. The Mind Has Mountains (1999), for which le Carr\u00e9 wrote that description witnesses the many warm friendships he kept up throughout life. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/28/audiobooks.features\" title=\"\">Risky Business: Books, Poker, Pastimes, People</a> (2007) is a collection of journalism exploring the lives of others who took their preoccupations to the limit, such as his neighbour the pianist Alfred Brendel.</p> <p>Alvarez\u2019s intransigence denied him many of the honours he deserved.

      "bodyText": "The eurozone economy came close to stalling in September after declines in global trade and the threat of a no-deal Brexit triggered the fastest fall in manufacturing output in nearly seven years. Germany was the main driver of the slump after a survey of private sector activity found that the growing threat to international trade from the tit-for-tat US-China trade war had left it in the worst position since 2009. Often referred to as the powerhouse of the 19-member currency bloc\u2019s economy, Germany has suffered a year-long slowdown that has accelerated in recent months. The German purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to 41.4 in September, from 43.5 in the previous month, and well below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. It contributed to a deepening manufacturing recession across the eurozone, where output fell at the sharpest pace since 2012 and optimism among business executives fell to its lowest level for seven years. Car manufacturers were among the worst hit by a rise in Chinese and US import tariffs and preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a deal next month. In a joint statement over the weekend, chiefs from 23 automotive business associations across Europe cautioned against the UK leaving without an agreement, saying it would lead to huge extra costs and possible job losses across the industry, including in the UK. Germany\u2019s overall composite PMI, which includes the services sector and manufacturing industry, was supported by a services sector that continued to expand, though not enough to prevent the PMI slipping to 49.1 from 51.7 in August. The composite PMI for the eurozone fell to 50.4 in September, down from 51.9 in August to signal the weakest expansion of output across manufacturing and services since June 2013. The euro dropped sharply against the dollar on the news, to $1.097, though it climbed against sterling, with one pound worth \u20ac1.13. Analysts said the figures, produced by the data firm IHS Markit, revealed that the slowdown in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy justified the European Central Bank\u2019s move earlier this month to cut interest rates and provide a package of stimulus measures to boost growth. Fiona Cincotta, a market analyst at spread betting firm City Index, said: \u201cThe fact the euro has dropped below the key $1.10 level suggests that traders believe there could be more monetary policy stimulus to come from the ECB.\u201d IHS Markit said the slowdown was driven by new orders for goods and services falling for the first time since January, dropping at the sharpest rate since June 2013. Firms were reluctant to hire new staff, the survey found, leading to the slowest increase in job creation since January 2015. Simon Wells, the chief European economist at HSBC, said: \u201cToday\u2019s PMIs make grim reading, particularly for Germany.

      "bodyText": "Four EU countries have sought to break the deadlock over European migration policy, as Italy\u2019s new government underlined its move away from the hardline policies of former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini. Interior ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Malta have agreed a joint proposal to relocate people rescued at sea and end the plight of migrant rescue boats adrift in the Mediterranean while countries bicker over who should help. The proposals were signed off at a special meeting in the fortified coastal city of Birgu in Malta, shortly after Italy\u2019s new left-leaning coalition government agreed to open one of its ports to a second NGO boat carrying 182 people. The departure of Salvini and his far-right League party from the Italian government has led to the reopening of the country\u2019s ports to NGO search and rescue boats and helped bring about the latest tentative agreement as France and Germany lead efforts to show that Italy will not be left alone in handling migrant arrivals from north Africa. However, the politics of migration continues to divide EU member states, even as the number of people making the dangerous central Mediterranean crossing is sharply down on recent years. In a bid to move on from the rancour of recent years, the latest paper proposes \u201ca temporary emergency mechanism\u201d, which means that rescued migrants would be relocated to other EU member states volunteering shelter, after arriving at a Mediterranean port. \u201cI find it crucial that we move away from ship-by-ship arrangements towards a more predictable solution,\u201d said Maria Ohisalo, the interior minister of Finland, which holds the presidency of the Council of the EU and helped broker Monday\u2019s deal. She said the next step was \u201cbringing together as many member states as possible\u201d. \u201cThese arrangements in order to be functional need to be built on shared responsibility involving a sufficiently large number of members states.\u201d The voluntary plan will be presented to the EU\u2019s 24 other interior ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg in October. It is unclear how many will sign up. While the European commission wants all member states to be involved in the scheme, ministers suggested that was unlikely. Hungary has led a band of central European refuseniks that will not take in any asylum seekers under an existing EU relocation scheme. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said the number of refugees redistributed through the scheme would depend on how many countries volunteered to take part. \u201cIf we had not now managed to produce a proposal with regard to the sea rescue, Europe\u2019s common asylum policy would no longer have been possible for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all of the same opinion that there must be a distribution of refugees, that we must not leave Italy and Malta here alone, and that the amount of refugees to be admitted will be discussed and decided in Luxembourg on 8 October, because the amount depends on the number of member states taking part.\u201d The potential breakthrough came as Italy\u2019s government authorised a second NGO rescue boat carrying 182 migrants to disembark in Sicily. Previously ships carrying migrants had been barred from Italian ports. The Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking, operated by the French charities SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, will disembark in Messina on Tuesday at 7am.

No more back to Libya!\u201d Awudu Baluduzzi, 27, from Ghana, told the agency. On 15 September, 82 other migrants have disembarked in Lampedusa, as Italy\u2019s new government intends to draw a line under the crisis. Giuseppe Conte, on his second mandate as prime minister, has promised to revise the previous government\u2019s anti-immigration policies, which provide for the closure of seaports to rescue vessels carrying migrants, the seizure of NGO boats and fines for ships that bring asylum seekers to Italy without permission.

His paintings here are incomplete monochromes, their surfaces filled with swipes and drags of a single yellow-green pigment that glows in the dark.

      "body": "<p>Airbnb hosts could have their identities included on a register for the first time to prevent illegal short-term rents and the use of scarce council housing as holiday accommodation.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based property rental platform will this week begin a consultation on proposals for a register of hosts. It will ultimately present a white paper to politicians and community leaders across the UK, who have complained they are powerless to act when whole blocks are sometimes overrun by short-term rentals. Any register would be held by governmental bodies rather than the provider itself and would apply across homeshare sites.</p> <p>Last week, the Brighton MP Caroline Lucas became the latest to back calls for a register saying it was completely unacceptable for residents to have to endure noisy parties in rented flats every weekend. As things stand, councils do not know who the hosts are.</p> <p>Airbnb appears determined to show it is willing to take the lead before local governments step in, amid growing demands from council leaders in Cornwall, Scotland and in the London tourist hubs of Camden, Kensington and Westminster to access host data with a warning that they cannot police the still-growing digital platform without it.</p> <p>Earlier this year one council tenant in Westminster, Toby Harman, was ordered to repay more than \u00a3100,000 after it emerged he had flouted his tenancy agreement by renting out his Vauxhall Bridge Road flat hundreds of times dating back to 2013.</p> <p>There were 223,200 UK listings on Airbnb in the year to July 2018 but few restrictions.

      "bodyText": "Airbnb hosts could have their identities included on a register for the first time to prevent illegal short-term rents and the use of scarce council housing as holiday accommodation. The San Francisco-based property rental platform will this week begin a consultation on proposals for a register of hosts. It will ultimately present a white paper to politicians and community leaders across the UK, who have complained they are powerless to act when whole blocks are sometimes overrun by short-term rentals. Any register would be held by governmental bodies rather than the provider itself and would apply across homeshare sites. Last week, the Brighton MP Caroline Lucas became the latest to back calls for a register saying it was completely unacceptable for residents to have to endure noisy parties in rented flats every weekend. As things stand, councils do not know who the hosts are. Airbnb appears determined to show it is willing to take the lead before local governments step in, amid growing demands from council leaders in Cornwall, Scotland and in the London tourist hubs of Camden, Kensington and Westminster to access host data with a warning that they cannot police the still-growing digital platform without it. Earlier this year one council tenant in Westminster, Toby Harman, was ordered to repay more than \u00a3100,000 after it emerged he had flouted his tenancy agreement by renting out his Vauxhall Bridge Road flat hundreds of times dating back to 2013. There were 223,200 UK listings on Airbnb in the year to July 2018 but few restrictions. In London, the law was changed in 2015 so that hosts cannot let out properties for more than 90 nights a year, but this has proved hard for councils to police. Patrick Robinson, director of public policy at Airbnb, said the system would \u201cgive authorities the information they need to regulate home sharing effectively, and that ultimately makes communities stronger\u201d. The company announced last week that it will float on the stock market next year and said it will start a six-month consultation on Thursday including in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bristol, Bath, Manchester, Brighton and Cornwall. Camden council said there are at least 7,000 properties in the borough used as short-term lets, many of which are being unlawfully used for more than 90 days a year. \u201cThe result of the explosion in the number of short-term rentals is the loss of permanent housing, and increased rents, all at a time of significant housing need,\u201d said Danny Beales, cabinet member for investing in communities. \u201cThey also often create amenity issues for residents, like creating noise disturbance and rubbish issues. We need the government to act and introduce a mandatory register of short-term lets. We also believe council\u2019s should have the power to introduce an overnight visitor levy, to deal with the related costs.\u201d Local government has taken action elsewhere to regulate short-term rentals. In March, authorities in Madrid said apartments which do not have a separate main entrance will no longer be allowed for short-term rentals, effectively removing thousands of properties from the market. Authorities in Berlin last year announced fines of up to \u20ac500,000 for breaching rules for short-term lets including getting a licence from the local authority or leaving it permanently untenanted. \u2022 This piece was amended on 24 September 2019 to clarify that any register would be held by government bodies rather than Airbnb.",

They need to win this game to secure their first Championship pennant. For Essex, 12 points ahead, a draw would suffice to repeat their victory of two years ago and they would have taken comfort from the truncated action on Monday.</p> <p>Having chosen to bat on a brown surface Somerset were 74 for four after 27.1 overs when the rain began to fall. It did not stop on a gloomy afternoon. It is not a great score, though superior to several around the county circuit. But that is not Somerset\u2019s sole problem. Not only must they beat Essex, they must also beat the weather since the forecast remains unpromising.</p> <p>The expectation that the pitch would help the spinners was strengthened when Somerset announced their team, which included three spin bowlers with the return of Jack Leach from his international duties, and confirmed when the tireless Simon Harmer took two wickets with his off-breaks; he now has 80 for the season.</p> <p>However, the first dents to Somerset\u2019s Championship hopes were delivered by Simon Cook, the no-nonsense opening bowler in the middle of a purple patch. With his first ball he found the edge of Murali Vijay\u2019s bat, which meant the Indian opener, signed up for Somerset\u2019s last three Championship matches, had to endure his fourth failure in five innings.</p> <p>Cook then dispatched Steve Davies lbw and Somerset were languishing at 14 for two. Jamie Porter, unusually profligate at the start, was soon replaced by Harmer but for 17 overs and 45 runs Tom Abell and James Hildreth repaired the innings watchfully. </p> <p>Then Harmer intervened as two of his off-breaks thudded into the pads to prompt the raising of Rob Bailey\u2019s finger. Two balls after Hildreth\u2019s dismissal, Tom Banton also had to return to the pavilion, though he would later be consoled by the news of his call-up to England\u2019s T20 squad for the tour of New Zealand.</p> <p>Then came the rain, which put a mild dampener on the lunchtime ceremony on the outfield, when Marcus Trescothick received an impressive montage containing photos spanning his 27 years as a professional for Somerset. He began in the same season that Mike Gatting was bamboozled by Shane Warne\u2019s first ball in Test cricket in this country and finishes now. Like so many cricket lovers before and after him it has been his ambition for the club to win that Championship for the first time \u2013 and while it is still worth winning. </p> <p>That little flurry of wickets plus the rain arriving according to the predicted timetable enhances the likelihood that he may have to wait a little longer. </p> <p>Ollie Pope hit an unbeaten 78 for Surrey on the day he was selected for England\u2019s winter Test tour of New Zealand. He had two narrow escapes on 38 and 68, but otherwise batted fluently to hit nine fours from 126 balls.</p> <p>Hampshire\u2019s chances of finishing third increased as they reached 80 for three before bad light stopped play at Canterbury having dismissed Kent \u2013 their closest rivals for the \u00a388,000 prize money \u2013 for 147.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T18:02:09.412Z\">at 7.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d88f7ba8f08f9df5bdda017\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T17:03:41.718Z\">6.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That\u2019s it for our county blog</strong> on a frustrating day for Somerset.

      "bodyText": "The only thing Somerset have won so far is the toss and that may be the limits of their success in their last match of the season. They need to win this game to secure their first Championship pennant. For Essex, 12 points ahead, a draw would suffice to repeat their victory of two years ago and they would have taken comfort from the truncated action on Monday. Having chosen to bat on a brown surface Somerset were 74 for four after 27.1 overs when the rain began to fall. It did not stop on a gloomy afternoon. It is not a great score, though superior to several around the county circuit. But that is not Somerset\u2019s sole problem. Not only must they beat Essex, they must also beat the weather since the forecast remains unpromising. The expectation that the pitch would help the spinners was strengthened when Somerset announced their team, which included three spin bowlers with the return of Jack Leach from his international duties, and confirmed when the tireless Simon Harmer took two wickets with his off-breaks; he now has 80 for the season. However, the first dents to Somerset\u2019s Championship hopes were delivered by Simon Cook, the no-nonsense opening bowler in the middle of a purple patch. With his first ball he found the edge of Murali Vijay\u2019s bat, which meant the Indian opener, signed up for Somerset\u2019s last three Championship matches, had to endure his fourth failure in five innings. Cook then dispatched Steve Davies lbw and Somerset were languishing at 14 for two. Jamie Porter, unusually profligate at the start, was soon replaced by Harmer but for 17 overs and 45 runs Tom Abell and James Hildreth repaired the innings watchfully. Then Harmer intervened as two of his off-breaks thudded into the pads to prompt the raising of Rob Bailey\u2019s finger. Two balls after Hildreth\u2019s dismissal, Tom Banton also had to return to the pavilion, though he would later be consoled by the news of his call-up to England\u2019s T20 squad for the tour of New Zealand. Then came the rain, which put a mild dampener on the lunchtime ceremony on the outfield, when Marcus Trescothick received an impressive montage containing photos spanning his 27 years as a professional for Somerset. He began in the same season that Mike Gatting was bamboozled by Shane Warne\u2019s first ball in Test cricket in this country and finishes now. Like so many cricket lovers before and after him it has been his ambition for the club to win that Championship for the first time \u2013 and while it is still worth winning. That little flurry of wickets plus the rain arriving according to the predicted timetable enhances the likelihood that he may have to wait a little longer. Ollie Pope hit an unbeaten 78 for Surrey on the day he was selected for England\u2019s winter Test tour of New Zealand. He had two narrow escapes on 38 and 68, but otherwise batted fluently to hit nine fours from 126 balls. Hampshire\u2019s chances of finishing third increased as they reached 80 for three before bad light stopped play at Canterbury having dismissed Kent \u2013 their closest rivals for the \u00a388,000 prize money \u2013 for 147. That\u2019s it for our county blog on a frustrating day for Somerset. They won an important toss on a Taunton dustbowl and reached a useful score of 75 for four before rain stopped play for the rest of the day. We\u2019ll be back in the morning, when the forecast is goodness knows, so please join Tanya then. I\u2019ll leave you with the close-of-play scores from around the country. Night! Division One Somerset 75-4 v Essex Kent 147 v Hampshire 80-3 Surrey 246-2 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 261-2 v Warwickshire Division Two Durham 197-6 v Glamorgan Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire Leicestershire 155 v Lancashire 2-1 Middlesex 176-3 v Derbyshire Sussex 150-5 v Worcestershire BJ Watling (83*) and Ben Raine (26*) are frustrating Glamorgan at Chester-le-Street, where Durham are 197 for six with a few overs remaining. Glamorgan have taken a sixth wicket at Chester-le-Street, where Durham are 162 for six. Michael Hogan has had a day out: 15-7-30-4. With Gloucestershire struggling at Bristol, Glamorgan have a serious chance of stealing a promotion place. Play has been abandoned everywhere, in fact, except Canterbury and Chester-le-Street. These are the latest scores.

Surrey finish on 246 for two against Notts, with Scott Borthwick 109 not out and Ollie Pope - recalled by England earlier in the day - unbeaten on 78. Pope, who is still only 21, averages over 70 in first-class cricket for Surrey. Permission to be very excited. To nobody\u2019s surprise, play has been abandoned for the day at Taunton. The forecast for tomorrow is mixed, but the heaviest rain should fall before and after play. Division One Somerset 75-4 v Essex Kent 147 v Hampshire 67-3 (two more wickets for Darren Stevens) Surrey 246-2 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 261-2 v Warwickshire Stumps Division Two Durham 144-5 v Glamorgan Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire Stumps Leicestershire 155 v Lancashire 2-1 Middlesex 176-3 v Derbyshire Sussex 150-5 v Worcestershire Stumps Play has been abandoned at Edgbaston, with Yorkshire on 261-2. Tom Kohler-Cadmore has larruped an unbeaten 165 from 175 balls. Rain or bad light have stopped play everywhere except Canterbury and Chester-le-Street. These are the latest scores: Division One Somerset 75-4 v Essex Kent 147 v Hampshire 53-1 Surrey 246-2 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 261-2 v Warwickshire Division Two Durham 140-4 v Glamorgan Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire Stumps Leicestershire 155 v Lancashire 2-1 Middlesex 176-3 v Derbyshire Sussex 150-5 v Worcestershire Stumps Matt Parkinson celebrated his England call-up by dismissing his twin brother Callum, LBW for 29. Leicestershire were dismissed for 155, with a rampant Richard Gleeson taking six for 43. Play has been abandoned for the day at Bristol, with Gloucestershire 80 for six against fellow promotion hopefuls Northamptonshire. There\u2019s no immediate prospect of an inspection at Taunton, never mind play. I\u2019m sure that will be it for the day. I\u2019m going to procure a coffee but will be back in five or 10 minutes.

Ed Smith says being dropped is an opportunity for Jonny Bairstow to \u201creset\u201d and work on a few things. \u201cMy prediction is he comes back very strongly.\u201d \u201cWhilst I am of course impressed and amused by the quality of the attempted jinx in by one and all to deny The East Saxons the championship, I\u2019d just like to point out that team on their final warning for the quality of their pitches producing a wicket \u2018like a crumble base\u2019 which is already kicking up \u2018clouds of dust like mushroom cloud\u2019 is asking for trouble,\u201d says Steve Pay. \u201cWe East Saxons know how how expensive that can be - 1989 still lives in our memory.\u201d Here\u2019s more on those exciting England squads \u201cOh Rob, IT\u2019S STILL RAINING,\u201d says Cath Hanley. \u201cBut to be honest the real damage was done last week - if I can only spend the rain break inventing a time machine, I might go back and gently roll a ball under Kyle Abbott\u2019s foot while he\u2019s warming up ...\u201d England\u2019s T20 squad Tom Banton, Pat Brown and Matt Parkinson are included in a very exciting young squad for the five-match T20 series in New Zealand: Morgan (c), Bairstow, Banton, Billings, Brown, S Curran, T Curran, Denly, Gregory, Jordan, Mahmood, Malan, Parkinson, Rashid, Vince. \u201cLast cricket of the summer, so what are your predictions for Wisden Cricketers of the Year?\u201d says Robert Razzell. \u201cMy guess is it will be bowler-heavy, Archer, Cummins, Hazlewood... perhaps Harmer, although it\u2019s not often there\u2019s a non-international cricketer of the year. How does Booth pick them?\u201d If I know Booth, it\u2019ll be after the 12th sambuca. At this stage, I\u2019d guess Archer, Cummins, Harmer, Perry and Labuschagne. The latest scores Glamorgan, who must win at Durham to have any chance of promotion, are starting to chip away. Division One Somerset 75-4 v Essex Kent 147 all out v Hampshire Surrey 220-2 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 234-1 v Warwickshire Division Two Durham 100-3 v Glamorgan Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire Leicestershire 135-7 v Lancashire Middlesex 159-3 v Derbyshire Sussex 150-5 v Worcestershire There\u2019s a lot to take in with that squad, never mind the omission of Jonny Bairstow. The inclusion of Saqib Mahmood and Matt Parkinson is really exciting, as are the less surprising call-ups for Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley. The team for the first Test might look like this: Burns, Sibley, Denly, Root, Stokes, Pope, Buttler, S Curran, Archer, Leach, Broad. Root (c), Archer, Broad, Burns, Buttler (wk), Crawley, S Curran, Denly, Leach, Mahmood, Parkinson, Pope, Sibley, Stokes, Woakes. I must say, I like that squad a lot. Crikey, Jonny Bairstow has been left out of the England squad to tour New Zealand! I think that\u2019s the right decision, but it\u2019s still surprising. Popewatch Ollie Pope is now 67 not out. If he doesn\u2019t go straight into the England Test team this winter, I\u2019ll be displeased. He averages over 70 in first-class cricket for Surrey. Mark Hooper is a worried man \u201cAfter a lifetime of watching Somerset anti-climaxes (amidst the odd one-day fireworks), it would be typical if they lost their best chance of the Championship title due to rain. (Yes, this is intended as a double jinx/anti-rain dance.) It doesn\u2019t look great, although you might only need around 180 overs of play for a result. Somerset may need to get very funky on the final day. It\u2019s still raining at Taunton. There\u2019s about as much chance of any more play today as there was of England winning the Headingley Test when Jack Leach walked to the crease. \u201cI have to agree with John Edrich that Rob Sim\u2019s square cut was piss poor \u2013 I was at school with him!\u201d sniggers Andrew Battershill. \u201cBut in his defence his school year (and my brother\u2019s) did manage to bowl out a local public school, Milton Abbey, for 10. Hi Rob!\u201d Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. Let\u2019s start with some latest scores, shall we. Ollie Pope is in the runs again, 45 not out against Nottinghamshire. Division One Somerset 75-4 v Essex Kent 111-8 v Hampshire Surrey 174-2 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 183-1 v Warwickshire Division Two Durham 76-2 v Glamorgan Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire Leicestershire 113-6 v Lancashire Middlesex 126-2 v Derbyshire Sussex 129-4 v Worcestershire Sky have resorted to a Steve Waugh master-class to nullify any overflow of sentiment. Another correspondent writes from Aberdeen - Malcolm Ferguson. \u201cHello Tanya. I had the pleasure of being taught at Aberdeen Academy by the great Rohan Kanhai when he was pro. at Aberdeenshire. Did not do me any good as of all the games I have played my worst was cricket but enjoyed playing the noble game the most. Hello to my old teammates and pals at Saracens in the 60s.\u201d Thank you Malcolm, and thank you everyone for your emails. Shame about the relentless rain - but that\u2019s showbiz. Talking of which, I\u2019m going to hand over now to the master of the OBO Rob Smyth. Have a great day and see you tomorrow! This is the scene. Advantage Essex. In eastern Russia, a lone woman is following Essex v Somerset. That honour falls to Louise Allcock. \u201cYou asked was anyone else taught by professional cricketers? Yes, Bryan Lobb was my housemaster at school. He taught me to play cricket aged 10. As one of very few girls (possibly the only) to enter the school single wicket cricket competition, I only drew Harvey Trump (11 himself so well before his Somerset days) in the first round. Pretty sure Mr Lobb (as will always be known to me) told Harvey to bowl gently! Pretty sure Harvey also went on to win the competition.\u201d Anthony Richardson was coached by Monte Lynch. \u201cDuring a fielding drill aged 13, he put up a high ball and shouted, \u2018I\u2019VE BET MY MORTGAGE ON THIS ONE, RICHO\u2019. I caught it, after which he said, \u2018I just lost my mortgage.\u2019 \u201cHe also told us that he sent a teammate off the field during his own testimonial for dropping a catch and chuckling about it. No suggestion of mortgage gambling on that occasion, of course.\u201d The Met Office forecast says there is 95 per cent chance of rain at Taunton till five o\u2019clock, where it declines to 60 per cent, and drops further to five per cent at seven o\u2019clock, nine minutes before the sun is due to set. So another reminiscence from the front line, to cheer us up. \u201cHi Tanya.\u201d Hi Andy! \u201cI saw your request for stories of telling offs from professional players. Back in the early 1980\u2019s I used to go to some nets run by Gloucestershire CCC in the school holidays. Among the instructors was former Somerset quick Ken Biddulph, who used to make the ball swing into your toes off a short run, and also a young RC Russell. Jack, for twas he, spotted that when I batted I would move my back foot backwards before the ball was bowled. I suppose that I could now claim that it was a trigger movement, but it was probably just me backing away from anything that might hit me. \u201cAnyway, Jack became frustrated with me, and threatened to kill me if I ever did it again. Since I am writing to you now I must have managed to stay still for a couple of deliveries, but I have often looked back fondly on the time that I received a death threat from England\u2019s greatest glovesman.\u201d \u201cBack in the day, Laurie Potter and Chris Balderstone would come down from Leicestershire to run indoor nets at my old school, Robert Smyth in Market Harborough,\u201d writes James Calder. \u201cI remember Balderstone bowling me all ends up with a leg-break. There was some serious talent on show at those nets: we had Ben Smith, who went on to win two county titles with Leicestershire before captaining Worcestershire, and future rugby legend Martin Johnson. Even in his mid-teens, Johnno was an imposing sight at the top of his run.\u201d Martin Johnson off a long run? What a frankly terrifying prospect. Here is Marcus Trescothick holding the picture frame he was awarded in the lunch break. The mood music is perfect for Somerset to win the title for him in this final season, but the weather, blasted, dirty, filthy clouds, has little interest in playing fair. Ah, the radio tells me that the tour parties will be announced in just under half an hour. Thank you Rob Sim, who had the pleasure of being taught by John Edrich, \u201cwho used to coach at Aberdeenshire Cricket Club. He used to tell me that my square cut was \u201cpiss-po[or?]t\u201d quite frequently\u2026.\u201d Back at Taunton, the rain has miserably become heavier. And 44 overs into the Notts v Surrey game, the ball has been changed for the fourth time. As the rain continues to fall at Taunton, an email arrives from Kim Thonger. I see Brian Rose, as Club President, is making the presentation to the very wonderful Marcus Trescothick. Brian and I have previous. He was my PE teacher at Broadoak School in Weston-super-mare. I\u2019m both proud and ashamed to say he once justifiably threatened to throw me through the wall bars for acting the giddy goat, and subsequently gave me 100 lines \u201cI must not use obscene language in the gym\u201d. Happier, simpler days. What a tale! Thank you. Is there anyone else out there who has been taught by an ex-professional cricketer? And if you had to give the ECB 100 lines, what would the sentence be? Thanks to Tim de Lisle for alerting me to this cracking bit of observation from Ali Martin: The rules are not the clearest, but I think he\u2019d still have quite a few years of qualification left. Let\u2019s have a look at the scores round the country...bundles of wickets for Northants in the Division 2 promotion match against Gloucestershire. In the other game with 2020 meaning, there has been a delayed start at The Riverside. Division One Kent 79-6 v Hampshire Surrey 117-2 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 128-1 v Warwickshire Division Two Durham 45-2 v Glamorgan - lunch will be taken at 1.30 because of the delayed start. Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire Leicestershire 81-4 v Lancashire Middlesex 72-2 v Derbyshire Surrey 81-3 v Worcestershire In the Sky studio, I can see the covers through the back window. They are on, and the sky is experimenting with different variations on black. Somerset dine with heavy, but not iron, hearts. Hildreth looked in great touch before he was out; Abell has been tenacious. Simon Harmer is showing just why he is the leading Championship wicket-taker; Sam Cook has also bowled superbly. Time for me to grab a quick lunch and shove a birthday cake in the oven while Somerset make a presentation to Marcus Trescothick for long and wonderful service. 28.5 overs: Somerset 75-4 ( Abell 24, Bartlett 5) There\u2019s a pretty good crowd in, great handfuls sitting in clumps in the various pavilions around the ground. You can still see the Quantocks from the Sky camera, but the groundsmen are leaning on the covers in readiness. Ah, there we go, the brollies are up and maroon covers are pushed on. This could be lunch... 27th over: Somerset 74-4 ( Abell 24, Bartlett 4) OOOOFFF, Bartlett pushes forward and the ball edges to the outstretched paw of Bopara at leg-slip, who can\u2019t clutch on. Tricky but possible. Lucky, lucky Bartlett. A breath. 26th over: Somerset 71-4 ( Abell 24, Bartlett 1 ) After two successive maidens, Somerset garner some runs. Just five off Cook this morning from 8 terrific overs, but here Bartlett gets off the mark with a scurried run that might have been dodgy had Nijjar\u2019s thrown hit. His reward - he\u2019ll have to face Harmer next over. 23rd over: Somerset 69-4 ( Abell 23, Bartlett 0 ) Bartlett faces Harmer, who has such an array of tricks in his drawstring bag. Slower ball, quicker one, ripping turner. Bartlett, understandably, is tentative, a tall, slim young man, slightly hunched over his bat, who has impressed those who have seen him this season. 22nd over: Somerset 69-4 ( Abell 23, Bartlett 0 ) Nijjar is hauled off after leaking runs, and the excellent Cook returns. Abell watches and waits; swishing at one that passes by on the inside edge; then just getting a bat on one that inches away. 21st over: Somerset 69-4 ( Abell 23, Bartlett 0 ) Rare riches for Somerset, as Harmer sends up a dolly, and Abell pings him to the boundary, then clips him for another two. The average runs per wicket this season at Taunton is 24.37 - I can\u2019t see Somerset getting over 200 here today. 20th over: Somerset 62-4 ( Abell 16, Bartlett 0 ) Bartlett has a slight advantage over Banton in that he gets to face Nijjar, not Harmer, for his first deliveries . Bartlett stretches forward and blocks him away. 19th over: Somerset 61-4 ( Abell 15 ) Ciderabad bites the hand that feeds it. Oh dear. Harmer has two in three after switching over the wicket and clopping Banton on the shin very, very, in front of the stumps. Harmer, round the wicket, the ball kept low, Hildreth crept back on his crease and that was that. Rob Bailey, almost reluctantly, raises the finger. 19th over: Somerset 61-2 ( Abell 15, Hildreth 32) Ah, a bowling change. Aron Nijjar, who inadvertently loosens the tap. Seven off his over as he strays off the line and Hildreth, eager as a tiger, collects a boundary. 18th over: Somerset 54-2 ( Abell 14, Hildreth 26) Someone send Simon Harmer a vest, his shirt seems to be too short, pulling up and showing the bottom of his back with every delivery. It\u2019s September! Your kidneys! Harmer is supremely unbothered, another superb over. 18th over: Somerset 53-2 ( Abell 14, Hildreth 25) The gloom seems to be deepening. Abell decides to leave the final ball of Porter\u2019s over which whips in off the seam, in a mushroom cloud of dust, a toffee-wrapper away from his body and the top of his stumps. 17th over: Somerset 51-2 ( Abell 14, Hildreth 23) Ravi Bopara and Ryan Ten Doeschate crouch under the helmets at forward short leg and short gully, mouths open for a tasty crimson titbit. Somerset live dangerously. 16th over: Somerset 51-2 ( Abell 14, Hildreth 23) Porter\u2019s blond head and beard are shaved to about the same degree - I wonder if it grows in the off-season.. Hildreth drives an over -pitched ball but Porter just gets a finger to it and stops its momentum. In the crowd, a poodle seems to be eating a kit-kat. 15th over: Somerset 50-2 ( Abell 14, Hildreth 22) The fifty comes up as Abell stretches forward to Harmer. A recovery, I think you could call this. Some stats from Sky - no Somerset batsman has an average of over 33 this year. 14th over: Somerset 46-2 ( Abell 12, Hildreth 21) A little light relief for the Somerset batsmen in the shape of dolly of a half-volley from Jamie Porter which Abell drives for four. The cameras turn side-on and we see how far Hildreth is batting out of his crease - a full shoe size out - he tips Porter through mid-wicket for a single. 13th over: Somerset 41-2 ( Abell 8, Hildreth 20) Harmer again. Every ball feel like a potential wicket - the bounce is uneven, the batsmen are playing dangerously on the back foot. Abell scurries up the other end as soon as he can. Hildreth crouches down on his haunches after one scuttles low. 12th over: Somerset 40-2 ( Abell 6, Hildreth 20) The umpires glance up at the sky; in the crowd we see an umbrella, raised. The umpires have pulled on their nylon zip-up coats; the players are mostly jumper-less. In the portable cabin, sit-out places they use for T20 games - the name escapes me, apologies - the players are drinking tea. Just one off the excellent Cook\u2019s over. 11th over: Somerset 39-2 ( Abell 5, Hildreth 20) Harmer drifts a little legside and Hildreth sweeps/swipes down for four. Then Harmer is a fraction, a tissue paper, short, and Hildreth sweeps again, squarer this time, for another boundary. 10th over: Somerset 31-2 ( Abell 5, Hildreth 12) Somerset don\u2019t have much leeway what with Harmer and one end and Cook at the other. Patience and luck will good friends today. Another relentless maiden from Cook. Ian Copestake writes: \u201cSomerset having a top order problem with Trescothick sitting in the wings makes me feel we have been needlessly denied.\u201d So true Ian. Maybe the old warhorse has declared himself out? 9th over: Somerset 31-2 ( Abell 5, Hildreth 12) The floodlights are on and, with the wind tugging his shirt, Simon Harmer, off-spinner extraordinaire, takes the ball. He has has 78 wickets at 18.12 this summer. It soon becomes clear why - he\u2019s an intimidating figure for an spinner - tall, stacked - and has the ball turning square. Rob Bailey turns down a pretty solid looking lbw appeal - rather him than me. 8th over: Somerset 27-2 ( Abell 5, Hildreth 12) The two batsmen are scurrying between the wickets, Hildreth has added a soupcon of energy to the batting this morning. He knocks Cook for his first runs of the day but batting against him, in his red-soled shoes, is not easy. 7th over: Somerset 26-2 ( Abell 5, Hildreth 11)A huge lbw roar from Porter\u2019s first ball but, after a heart in mouth pause, the answer is no - possibly just outside the line. The skies, I\u2019m sorry to say are darkening. Ah, that\u2019s lovely: Hildreth clops the ball into the leg side for four; then a push into the offside, timing to die for, for another boundary. 6th over: Somerset 17-2 ( Abell 5, Hildreth 2) We see Marcus Trescothick on the balcony, in leisure clothing, not whites. Sniff. Simon Harmer is warming those ample shoulders up on the boundary. And a maiden from Cook who has been terrific this morning, forcing the batsmen to play. 5th over: Somerset 17-2 ( Abell 5, Hildreth 2) The slips can practically read the clothing label on the inside of Abell\u2019s trousers - they\u2019re close, and creeping closer, as the ball dips and hardly carries off the pitch. Abell strides forward hugely, and sends the ball scurrying square off Porter. Nice. 4th over: Somerset 14-2 ( Abell 4) Cook angles the ball in from wide of the wicket, and Davies isn\u2019t nimble enough to move out of the way. The Somerset tail has often rescued the top order this year - hope they\u2019re prepared for a repeat performance today. Argh. Davies tucks his bat under his arm and trudges off. The last ball of Cook\u2019s over is a straight one and Davies doesn\u2019t move, the umpire ponders for a lifetime but the dodgy digit is raised. 3rd over: Somerset 14-1 (Davies 2, Abell 4) The Somerset batsmen are nervy, playing and missing, pushing tentatively. Porter, straight, high-armed, run-up, is on the money. Davies turns him off his legs for a quick single. Then some relief as Porter over-pitches, and Abell drive him at 70 degrees for four. 2nd over: Somerset 7-1 (Davies 1, Abell 0) Cook whistles the ball past the nervous pushing blade of Abell with his last ball of the over. He looks dangerous. Not the start Somerset were after. Sam Cook whisks the ball down, the seam wobbling all the way, it moves slightly away, Vijay nibbles, nibbles, nibbles, and the ball falls low into the left glove of a diving Adam Wheater. 1st over: Somerset 7-0 (Vijay 6; Davies 1 ) Jamie Porter scurries in to Murali Vijay, who after two balls is kicking dust behind him like a donkey on a dusty spanish plain. A glorious drive brings up the first boundary of the match. In the manner of a Radio one DJ - perhaps something for the ECB to think about next year - a shout out from Finbar Anslow. \u201cMorning Tanya, just got back from sunny Essex (though my heart lies elsewhere) and am now once more in drizzly Milan. A big hello to all Somerset fans especially my Mum, Barbara Anslow, 100 not out.\u201d Hello Barbara, and congratulations! What Somerset would do for a 100 not out today... Showers are expected later in the afternoon but as the umpires walk out, the sky is light blue with decorative clouding. Here we go. Impressive mowing from the Somerset groundsman - there actually doesn\u2019t seem to be a single blade of grass on the entire pitch. Alastair Cook, leading run scorer on either side in the Championship, is looking chilled. \u201cIt is amazing what momentum does,\u201d he says ominously for Somerset. Sky has gone live to Somerset where the sky is blue and the flag is flying on the cathedral. Nick Knight is wearing salmon trousers and waving the Championship trophy around. Somerset have won the toss and are going to bat. A nervous Tom Abell says, \u201cBatting first is something that has done well for us this year.\u201d Somerset have won five out of six games at home this summer. Looking at the pitch, bare and dusty, this will be a battle of the spinners: Simon Harmer v Jack Leach. Hello from this first day of the final round of a dangly gold earring of a cricket season and, perhaps, the end of an era. The introduction of the Hundred next year, and the subsequent changes big and small likely to come from that, mean this could mark the beginning of the end of the rule of the 18 counties. But, as if the Championship knew what might be in store, it has served up a cracker. Surprises, disappointments - from Nottinghamshire\u2019s car-crash , to Surrey\u2019s surprise hiccup - and the season going to the last, the Championship still in the balance at the final round. Somerset, perennial bridesmaids, five times this millennium, are after their first precious pennant. But to do so, they must overcome the 12 point deficit they take into their game against the leaders Essex at Taunton. Essex, 2017 Champs and fresh winners of the T20 Blast, need only draw.. Jack Leach has been allowed to play for Somerset, we hope Marcus Trescothick will make a talismanic 12th man appearance So, in recognition of all this, we\u2019ve decided to do something a little bit different: CountyCricketLive! has turned into an over-by-over of the Essex v Somerset match. You\u2019ll still be able to chat BTL and email/tweet in. Hope you enjoy it! Here is some pre-game reading setting the scene \u2026",

By the end of talks, Netanyahu was one point ahead, with 55 endorsements over Gantz\u2019s 54.</p> \n<p>However, Rivlin, who is tasked after an election with picking a candidate to form a government, has suggested that since neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority of 61 seats that they form a unity government together.</p> \n<p>\u201cA stable government cannot be formed without the two big parties and this, I believe, is the will of the people,\u201d Rivlin\u2019s office quoted him as saying.</p> \n<p>The president invited Netanyahu and Gantz to meet him for closed-door talks late on Monday evening in a effort to break the deadlock.

      "bodyText": "Benjamin Netanyahu has come out narrowly ahead of his rival, Benny Gantz, during consultations with Israeli parliamentarians on who should lead the next government, although it remained unclear if he would be chosen to form a coalition. President Reuven Rivlin ended two days of talks on Monday with representatives from all the Knesset parties, following a stalled election last week that has thrown uncertainly over the country\u2019s political future. Members from rightwing, centre-left, religious, far-right nationalist and Arab parties gave their recommendations on who should lead. By the end of talks, Netanyahu was one point ahead, with 55 endorsements over Gantz\u2019s 54. However, Rivlin, who is tasked after an election with picking a candidate to form a government, has suggested that since neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority of 61 seats that they form a unity government together. \u201cA stable government cannot be formed without the two big parties and this, I believe, is the will of the people,\u201d Rivlin\u2019s office quoted him as saying. The president invited Netanyahu and Gantz to meet him for closed-door talks late on Monday evening in a effort to break the deadlock. Discussion could continue into next week before a decision is made. On Sunday, Gantz appeared to briefly be the favourite after an alliance of Arab parliamentarians who largely represent Palestinian citizens of Israel announced they would endorse the ex-military general. Support from the Joint List, which won 13 seats in Tuesday\u2019s polls, made the bloc the third-largest force in the 120-seat Knesset. However, Rivlin said on Monday morning that three Arab politicians from the Palestinian nationalist Balad party had abstained \u2013 putting Netanyahu ahead by one recommendation. Rivlin, whose role is usually ceremonial, is not obliged to pick Netanyahu. He can choose any candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a government. Usually, the decision is clear, and often goes to the leader of the largest party, but the muddied election result has created an impasse. Netanyahu has backed the idea of a unity government, although he has been coy about who would lead or if the role would be rotated. Gantz has ruled out serving with Netanyahu, who is facing the prospect of three corruption indictments. If they do not join together, the president has the power to choose either, who will then have up to six weeks to form a majority government. If that person fails, Rivlin could then ask a second candidate. That scenario played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance. Many fear a third election will be called if the current stalemate continues. Israel\u2019s apparent kingmaker, the far-right ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman, has said he will not back either and also called for a unity government. Sunday\u2019s endorsement of Gantz by Arab parties, while not giving him a clear lead, broke an almost-three-decade policy of not supporting an Israeli leader while the occupation in the Palestinians territories continues. The last time Arab parties backed a candidate was in 1992, when they supported Yitzhak Rabin, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. Palestinian citizens of Israel, or Arab Israelis, make up close to a fifth of the 9 million population. Leaders in the group made clear they were not backing Gantz, who led a devastating 2014 war on Gaza, but instead attempting to topple Netanyahu, whose election campaign focused on demonising Arab Palestinian citizens and who pushed for a law they say made them second-class citizens. \u201cWe have become illegitimate in Israeli politics in the Netanyahu era,\u201d the leader of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, told Rivlin when informing him of the endorsement. \u201cWe are this time recommending Benny Gantz to form the next government.\u201d The prominent Arab parliament member Ahmad Tibi added: \u201cHistory is done: we\u2019ll do what is needed to bring down Netanyahu.\u201d",

Here are seven pieces of classical music that can transport us into a world of relaxation and wellbeing.</p> <p><strong>Edward Elgar \u2013 Variations on an Original Theme, Op 36 (Enigma): 9 Nimrod<br></strong>Nimrod is one of a suite of short pieces from Edward Elgar\u2019s Enigma Variations. In popular culture it has become a British anthem, though it was actually a cryptic tribute to his friend Augustus Jaeger. The enigmatic element of the work is useful in mindful listening, in that the overarching musical theme is intended as a mystery that need not be solved \u2013 like the mystery of life, to be dipped into as it occurs. Concentrate on what is actually happening in the music as you<em> </em>breathe along with the work\u2019s gentle pulse, rather than zoning out as you anticipate the orchestral climax. The conception of the work is an instance of mindfulness itself. The composer was noodling at the piano when his wife pointed out that he had written a marvellous melody. He had allowed it to emerge, he later said, \u201cfrom nothing\u201d.</p> <p>You can listen to this piece live at the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ef2mzc\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC Concert Orchestra\u2019s Orchestra Unwrapped concert</a> on 26 September.</p> <p><strong>Pauline Oliveros \u2013 Deep Listening<br></strong>\u201cWalk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears,\u201d said American experimental composer Pauline Oliveros. She became obsessed with mindfulness through \u201cdeep listening\u201d, a term she coined in 1988 after descending four metres into a disused water tank to make a recording of the same name. The underground room had an acoustic resonance lasting 45 seconds, allowing the musicians to create a smooth overlapping texture by listening carefully to each other. The album Deep Listening presents four pieces conceived as an aid to mindful focus. Choose one of them, concentrate on the constant drone of the didgeridoo, then become aware of the slowly evolving sounds of accordion and voice as they expand and contract around it. Purge your mind of clutter as you focus on this swirling soundscape, allowing the melodic trombone line to order your thinking.</p> <p><strong>Gustav Mahler \u2013 Symphony No 2 (Resurrection), Urlicht<br></strong>Gustav Mahler declared that: \u201cA symphony must be like the world. It must contain everything.\u201d To experience his immense symphonies is, therefore, to musically engage with the vastness of the human experience, and his second is a case in point. It starts with a funeral march and questions the randomness of life, before concluding that it is wondrous and meaningful. This positivity begins in the fourth movement, Urlicht (Primal Light), a slow, simple song arranged for solo singer and sparse orchestra. When the choir, with full orchestra, enters for the final Resurrection movement and sings: \u201cDie shall I in order to live; rise again, yes rise again\u201d, feel the energy flow through your body, swelling and expansive like the music.</p> <p><strong>Johannes Ockeghem \u2013 Alma Redemptoris Mater<br></strong>If ever there was a form of music designed for mindful reflection, it is Renaissance polyphony, which shows the beauty and complexity that can be achieved by voices alone. Alma Redemptoris Mater<em> </em>by Johannes Ockeghem is such an example. Written during the 15th century, this sacred motet is presented by just four voices. Close your eyes, breathe and follow the individual vocal lines as they flow together and apart, weaving a rich harmonic tapestry of sound. Focus on the beauty of the words: \u201cLoving mother of the redeemer, who opens the gate to heaven, and star of the sea \u2026 You who gave birth, in the wonderment of nature, to your own creator ...\u201d After its five minutes duration, you should feel both calm and focused.</p> <p>You can listen to this piece performed live by the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ewrn5v\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC Singers on 7 December</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ralph Vaughan Williams \u2013 The Lark Ascending<br></strong>This exquisite musical depiction of a singing lark taking to the air has been described by British violinist Tasmin Little as \u201cfloating above a cushion of sound\u201d. Its composer, Ralph Vaughan Williams was inspired by George Meredith\u2019s poem The Lark Ascending. Read the poem, then listen to the music, focusing on the violin depicting the bird as \u201cHe rises and begins to round\u201d. Observe the lark\u2019s efforts to take flight: \u201cAs up he wings the spiral stair\u201d, swooping as it trills \u201cA song of light\u201d. Follow its ascent, until at last the full orchestra glides with the creature, saluting its \u201cSerenity in ravishment\u201d. Finally, become the lark, letting your spirit fly free \u2013 and, in your mind\u2019s eye, look down upon the rural landscape rolling beneath you.</p> <p>You can listen to this piece live at the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e2wxp6\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC Symphony Orchestra concert</a> on 1 November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sounds-of-our-lives/2019/sep/23/five-ways-to-get-your-family-into-classical-music\">Five ways to get your family into classical music</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Olivier Messiaen \u2013 Quartet for the End of Time<br></strong>French composer Olivier Messiaen\u2019s Quartet for the End of Time is an exceptional example of mindfulness. Incarcerated in a freezing prisoner of war camp, he created a piece about the end of time itself, when all earthly concerns will be swept away as foretold in the Revelation of St John. This extraordinary piece was premiered at the camp on old battered instruments in January 1941. By writing for the only instruments available (violin, cello, clarinet and piano), Messiaen was adapting to the moment, yet was focused on eternity. The mindful theme is also present in the musical structure itself, which is based on an unravelling mathematical sequence that, if played out, would be infinite.</p> <p><strong>John Cage \u2013 4\u201933\u2019\u2019<br></strong>Mindfulness is about time, specifically now. Consequently, the ultimate work of mindfulness might be John Cage\u2019s 4\u201933\u2019\u2019. More of an experimental concept than piece of music, Cage\u2019s 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence presents a set time framework in which a pianist (or any solo/group of musicians) sits at the piano and turns the pages of the empty score in silence. Meanwhile, the audience is invited to listen to the ambient sounds in the auditorium \u2013 breathing, air conditioning, the rumble of cars outside ... essentially, listening to the world around them as a unique aural event and appreciating its variety, rather than ignoring it as irrelevant noise. Of course, you don\u2019t have to attend a concert to experience this \u2013 just set your timer, close your eyes and listen.</p> <p><em>Choose your own mindful listening from the BBC\u2019s upcoming series of classical concerts from the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/symphonyorchestra\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/concertorchestra\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC Concert Orchestra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/singers\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC Singers</a></em></p>",

The funds involved were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/britain-iran-relationship-caught-up-in-mutual-blame-game\">\u00a3400</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/britain-iran-relationship-caught-up-in-mutual-blame-game\">m owed by the UK</a> for a decades-old tank sale. In return, the Iranian foreign minister said he was prepared to argue for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release at an Iranian court.</p> <p>Zarif said the proposal remained on the table when Boris Johnson became foreign secretary, but his successor, Jeremy Hunt, abandoned it.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy started talking about \u2018you\u2019re asking for ransom\u2019. And I said: \u2018Come on, this is not something that I started. This is something that Philip started,\u2019\u201d Zarif said. \u201cJeremy started to play tough because he wanted to become prime minister and it didn\u2019t work out for anybody.\u201d</p> <p> Zarif said the release of funds would not have amounted to a ransom.</p> <p>\u201cAs the foreign minister I do not have a standing in an Iranian court on any issue of somebody who is an Iranian citizen,\u201d Zarif said. Iran does not recognise dual nationality in cases of Iranian nationals.</p> <p>\u201cI have a standing for any foreigner who is accused of spying. I have a standing when I say there is an exchange. That gives me a standing in a court. That gives me a way to intervene.\u201d</p> <p>The foreign minister said the subject came up in a recent phone conversation with the current UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, but with no conclusion.</p> <p>\u201cHe [raised it] and I told him that there was an offer from their side which unfortunately hasn\u2019t been fulfilled.

So I am glad that foreign minister Zarif has been so clear. Transparency has been a long time coming.\u201d</p> <p>Ratcliffe has previously raised concerns about his wife\u2019s mental health under harsh prison conditions, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/25/i-fear-nazanin-will-take-her-own-life-says-husband-richard-ratcliffe\">expressed fears</a> she could take her own life.</p> <p>\u201cOf course this is not a dispute that Nazanin should have ever been tangled up in in the first place. But it is also extraordinary it has been allowed to last so long, and that the twists and turns of ministers\u2019 actions have allowed it to get so much worse for Nazanin, and others taken, with us all just encouraged to quietly wait.\u201d</p> <p>Zarif said Iran had also been in negotiations with the US mediated by Switzerland over a possible exchange of prisoners but those talks had also stalled. \u201cThere is a proposal on the table with the United States. We exchanged the names through the Swiss. So we are ready,\u201d Zarif said.</p> <p>In the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Zarif said he would have offered an exchange to the Iranian courts, which he described as an exchange of court decisions.</p> <p>\u201cBritain owes us that \u00a3400m for 40 years,\u201d he told a group of reporters at the margins of the UN general assembly. \u201cNazanin is in prison based on a court decision. United Kingdom is supposed to give us money based on a court decision. Now they want us to reverse our court decision but they don\u2019t want to implement their court decision. You see the irony?\u201d</p> <p>As relations worsen with the west, Iran has stepped up arrests of dual nationals and foreign visitors. This month, it emerged that two British-Australian dual nationals and an Australian had been detained.</p> <p>One of the detainees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/17/shes-not-a-spy-friends-shocked-over-academic-dr-kylie-moore-gilberts-jailing-in-iran\">Kylie Moore-Gilbert</a>, is a British-Australian lecturer at the University of Melbourne and has been held at the notorious Evin prison in Tehran for almost a year.</p> <p>Another British-Australian woman, Jolie King, and her Australian boyfriend, Mark Firkin, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/12/australian-couple-arrested-iran-named-jolie-king-mark-firkin\">held for the past 10 weeks</a>. They were detained in Iran while on a trip around the world that they had been recording on social media.</p> <p>British ministerial sources accepted there had been an agreement in principle between the Treasury and the Foreign Office for the payment to be made to the Iranians in line with the court judgment, but said the payment would probably have been made in the form of delivery of medicines.</p> <p>The proposal met fierce resistance from the then defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who pointed out a payment of \u00a3400m to the Iranian defence ministry at a time when the US was trying to squeeze the flow of funds to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards was not politically feasible.</p> <p>One ministerial source said: \u201cWhat Iran has done with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is unconscionable, and she deserves to be released under Iranian law. But it is also true that Britain owes a debt to Iran under international law, and if we are ever to build a relationship of trust with Iran, this payment has to be made and it would be wise to do so. There is no reason for the payment of this debt to be linked to the release, even if it clearly is in the Iranians\u2019 minds.\u201d</p> <p>The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: \u201cWe do not, and have never, accepted any suggestion that the UK would pay Iran to release UK nationals who have been arbitrarily detained. They must be released unconditionally. The UK will not be blackmailed, and the Foreign Minister\u2019s comments only bring the Iranian government further into disrepute.</p> <p>\u201cWe will highlight our concerns over innocent people being held in Iran without due judicial process at the UN this week.\u201d</p> <p>Suggestions by Zarif that Hunt refused to make the payment because of his Conservative leadership ambitions were dismissed by British officials as mischievous.</p> <p>Efforts within the UK government were continuing over the payment as recently as a few months ago, but even ministers knowledgeable about the case, and broadly sympathetic to the Iranian argument over the outstanding debt, have privately said it is politically impossible to make the payment in the current context.</p> <p>Richard Ratcliffe has flown to New York in an attempt to meet Zarif, who is there for the UN general assembly, and to launch a campaign called Families Alliance Against State Hostage Taking. The initiative includes other families of foreign and dual nationals held hostage in Iran.</p> <p>\u201cI have often said in the media, governments have an obligation to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for all of us in situations of profound distrust, protection lies in the rule of law. If the UK upholds its international legal obligations, it is more likely Iran will uphold its obligations \u2013 including human rights.\u201d</p>",

But it is also extraordinary it has been allowed to last so long, and that the twists and turns of ministers\u2019 actions have allowed it to get so much worse for Nazanin, and others taken, with us all just encouraged to quietly wait.\u201d Zarif said Iran had also been in negotiations with the US mediated by Switzerland over a possible exchange of prisoners but those talks had also stalled. \u201cThere is a proposal on the table with the United States. We exchanged the names through the Swiss. So we are ready,\u201d Zarif said. In the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Zarif said he would have offered an exchange to the Iranian courts, which he described as an exchange of court decisions. \u201cBritain owes us that \u00a3400m for 40 years,\u201d he told a group of reporters at the margins of the UN general assembly. \u201cNazanin is in prison based on a court decision. United Kingdom is supposed to give us money based on a court decision. Now they want us to reverse our court decision but they don\u2019t want to implement their court decision. You see the irony?\u201d As relations worsen with the west, Iran has stepped up arrests of dual nationals and foreign visitors. This month, it emerged that two British-Australian dual nationals and an Australian had been detained. One of the detainees, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, is a British-Australian lecturer at the University of Melbourne and has been held at the notorious Evin prison in Tehran for almost a year. Another British-Australian woman, Jolie King, and her Australian boyfriend, Mark Firkin, have been held for the past 10 weeks. They were detained in Iran while on a trip around the world that they had been recording on social media. British ministerial sources accepted there had been an agreement in principle between the Treasury and the Foreign Office for the payment to be made to the Iranians in line with the court judgment, but said the payment would probably have been made in the form of delivery of medicines. The proposal met fierce resistance from the then defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who pointed out a payment of \u00a3400m to the Iranian defence ministry at a time when the US was trying to squeeze the flow of funds to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards was not politically feasible. One ministerial source said: \u201cWhat Iran has done with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is unconscionable, and she deserves to be released under Iranian law. But it is also true that Britain owes a debt to Iran under international law, and if we are ever to build a relationship of trust with Iran, this payment has to be made and it would be wise to do so. There is no reason for the payment of this debt to be linked to the release, even if it clearly is in the Iranians\u2019 minds.\u201d The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: \u201cWe do not, and have never, accepted any suggestion that the UK would pay Iran to release UK nationals who have been arbitrarily detained. They must be released unconditionally. The UK will not be blackmailed, and the Foreign Minister\u2019s comments only bring the Iranian government further into disrepute. \u201cWe will highlight our concerns over innocent people being held in Iran without due judicial process at the UN this week.\u201d Suggestions by Zarif that Hunt refused to make the payment because of his Conservative leadership ambitions were dismissed by British officials as mischievous. Efforts within the UK government were continuing over the payment as recently as a few months ago, but even ministers knowledgeable about the case, and broadly sympathetic to the Iranian argument over the outstanding debt, have privately said it is politically impossible to make the payment in the current context. Richard Ratcliffe has flown to New York in an attempt to meet Zarif, who is there for the UN general assembly, and to launch a campaign called Families Alliance Against State Hostage Taking. The initiative includes other families of foreign and dual nationals held hostage in Iran. \u201cI have often said in the media, governments have an obligation to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for all of us in situations of profound distrust, protection lies in the rule of law. If the UK upholds its international legal obligations, it is more likely Iran will uphold its obligations \u2013 including human rights.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cLondon: The Biography by Peter Ackroyd (2000) made me fall in love with London all over again. The blood of the city\u2019s history soaked into the clay. Quiet hidden corners, conspiratorial whispers in coffee houses, the dirty Thames and the Great Stink. Invasions, bridges, fires and fog. It\u2019s a very human tale told with the verve of a novelist, the detail of a diarist and the grace of a poet.\u201d \u2013 dylan37 \u201cThe one novel I\u2019ve read from the century to date that I am sure will stay with me for the rest of my life, for personal as well as for general reasons, is The Hunger Angel by Herta M\u00fcller (translated by Philip Boehm in 2012). It was published in German as Atemschaukel in 2009, just before she (deservedly) won the Nobel prize for literature. It\u2019s an extraordinarily dense and poetic work and one that seems to transcend language \u2013 so perfectly written that text and idea are fused, yet still overflowing with humanity.\u201d \u2013 nilpferd \u201cI also rate The City and the City very highly but Perdido Street Station by China Mi\u00e9ville (2000) is the one I\u2019ve reread a couple of times since I first came across it. The world he builds is convincing and immersive, whereas in some of his later work it can feel like the ideas he wants to explore take primacy over character development, plot and setting.\u201d \u2013 Vonnegut \u201cThe People\u2019s Act of Love by James Meek (2005) is like a classic Russian masterpiece, written by a British author, dark and a bit twisted.\u201d \u2013 BParker \u201cVery surprised not to see any of Amitav Ghosh\u2019s Ibis Trilogy (2008-2015). Historical writing very much for our time, set in the 1830s when drugs, capital, indentured labour and languages themselves were moving across the seas between Britain, India and China. Ghosh juggles the fates of multiple and memorable British, Indian and Chinese characters with some glorious writing, especially about ships and the sea.\u201d \u2013 bertilek \u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver (2003) is one of the most disturbing, unstoppable and unforgettable books I\u2019ve ever read. Incredibly well written and a sucker punch twist at the end.\u201d \u2013 MajorJackCelliers \u201cWas waiting and waiting for Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig (2015) to appear. Very intelligently written, beautiful, heartbreaking and life-affirming and SO important \u2013 it has saved countless lives. Can\u2019t imagine a more important book.\u201d \u2013 gadget \u201cEast West Street by Phillippe Sands (2016) is a work of startling humanity, timely importance, magisterial prose and emotional depth. Not many laughs, I grant you, but on any measure it beats most of the non-fiction on this list into a cocked hat.\u201d \u2013 MartyPines \u201cConvenience Store Woman by Sakata Murata (2016, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori in 2018) and Quiet by Susan Cain (2012). Convenience Store Woman was short but brilliant, with incisive observations about Japanese society, convenience store \u2018culture\u2019 and how \u2018outsiders\u2019 and those with mental health conditions are often maligned and misunderstood by society. Quiet was a fascinating read with eye-opening revelations on how soft-spoken and shy individuals often don\u2019t receive the credit they deserve.\u201d \u2013 piggywigee \u201cThe Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2007) was the first time I had seen a clear explanation of the two types of statistics that explain clearly \u201cnormal\u201d events and statistically \u201cfractal\u201d ones such as stock-market crashes and delayed projects. It also made me realise how poorly educated we are.\u201d \u2013 Maclon \u201cThe Rest Is Noise by Alex Ross (2007), his superb survey of 20th -century music, which makes you want to listen immediately to each and every piece he discusses; Anathem by Neal Stephenson (2008), which takes you from monkish cloisters to the stars in bravura style; Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel (2016), which gives the most illuminating insight into \u2026 illuminated manuscripts (something you never thought you\u2019d find interesting, but read this and you will!); and The Algebraist by Iain Banks (2004). (There has to be something by Banksie in any list of this sort \u2013 perhaps you\u2019d prefer Transition, but anyway, he knocks spots off yer McEwans, Rowlings and Amises.)\u201c \u2013 Dogbertd \u201cStephen Baxter\u2019s Space (2000). The hardest of hard science fiction authors (save for perhaps Kim Stanley Robinson), and also the one with the most \u201cout there\u201d ideas. Never more epic than the climax of Space. The book is an incredible answer to Fermi\u2019s Paradox \u2026 you\u2019ll remember Space forever. It answers everything.\u201d \u2013 dholliday \u201cI\u2019d just add a shout out for Liu Cixin\u2019s Three Body Problem (2008, translated by Ken Liu in 2014). A really different hard science fiction take on \u201care we alone in the universe and why has no one contacted us yet\u201d, made more intriguing by the fact it was originally written in Chinese and therefore has totally different cultural assumptions to our usual western sci-fi.\u201d \u2013 yazbod \u201cAdrian Desmond and James Moore\u2019s Darwin\u2019s Sacred Cause (2009) is the companion and follow-up to these authors\u2019 1991 biography of Darwin.

      "bodyText": "THE WORST Labelled \u201cthe hissing hooligans\u201d by the Italian media, it could be argued the loggionisti are the ultras of the opera world. From their places in the cheap seats high in the gods of Milan\u2019s La Scala, this vocal minority of purists have reduced many a world-famous performer to tears with their loud and forthright on-the-spot critiques. And while those taking to the stage at the world\u2019s most famous opera house tonight are well used to fielding abuse from hostile crowds, it is to be hoped The Best Fifa Football Awards\u2122 pass off without any of the talent present getting upset. Of course, with Cristiano Ronaldo in town, the possibility of a petulant diva strop is always on the cards and the Juventus and Portugal star may well throw a hissy-fit when Virgil van Dijk scoops the Best Men\u2019s Player award ahead of both he and Leo Messi. In the women\u2019s category brave English Lioness Lucy Bronze is likely to miss out at the expense of Team USA! USA!! USA!!!\u2019s Alex Morgan or Megan Rapinoe, but will at least have a good view of the stage as the Fiver hears she has borrowed her team-mate Ellen White\u2019s goal celebration opera glasses especially for the grand occasion. In the men\u2019s coach category, Big Cup-winning Liverpool boss J\u00fcrgen Klopp, his domestic treble-winning Manchester City counterpart Pep and increasingly-forlorn Tottenham Hotspur gaffer Mauricio Pochettino will duke it out for the gong, while the women\u2019s equivalent will be contested between World Cup-winning Team USA!! USA!!! USA!!! coach Jill Ellis and Netherland\u2019s\u2019 Sarina Wegman. For reasons that remain unclear, England\u2019s Phil Neville has also made the shortlist for his services in costing the Football Association a fortune to make England slightly-less good than they were four years ago. Even if Messi fail to win men\u2019s player gong, he may not go home empty-handed. The Argentinian maestro is also on the three-man shortlist for the Pusk\u00e1s Award for best goal along with Juan Fernando Quintero and Daniel Zsori. Filling the obligatory \u201csome unlikely clogger from the backwaters of Ireland or Scotland\u201d role, Billie Simpson of Sion Swift Ladies failed to make the cut for her world-class agricultural hoof from inside her own half against Cliftonville Ladies in the Norn Iron Premiership. With the only remaining awards of this orgy of self-congratulatory Fifa backslapping rather randomly going to male and female goalkeepers, the jeers from the cheap-seats may come from rattle-throwing team-mates upset that their individual outfield contributions have been ignored. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201c\u2018Footballers are obviously targeted individuals. They want something that when they go away will keep their family safe. They\u2019re not aggressive animals in the slightest \u2014 until called upon\u201d \u2013 Richard Arnold, boss of Chaperone K9, a company that flogs guard dogs to people with loads of dosh, explains why Paul Pogba has splashed out \u00a315,000 on one of the company\u2019s specially-trained rottweilers.

Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Nick Kershaw. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Kick It Out has called on the FA to take action against a \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d tweet by Bernardo Silva in reference to his Manchester City teammate Benjamin Mendy. Perhaps because their fans need cheering up, Manchester United are going to carry out a feasibility study into installing rail seating at Old Trafford. \u201cWe believe it will likely benefit atmosphere but also enhance spectator safety in areas where fans already persistently stand,\u201d cheered a Manchester United Supporters\u2019 Trust suit, probably while standing. Fans of Liverpool and Manchester United are awaiting news on whether tickets for upcoming Euro Vase and Big Cup away games will be valid after financial-knack led to the collapse of Thomas Cook, who organise travel packages for both clubs.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/23/can-you-solve-it-maths-on-the-back-of-an-envelope\">Earlier today</a> I set you four puzzles, and a challenge to devise a rhyme about a pint being 568ml. The solutions first and the best pint-sized poems afterwards.</p> <p>1) <em>A piece of paper is folded to make a shape that looks a bit like the back of an envelope, illustrated below. If the paper is unfolded again to make a flat sheet, what shape will it be? Prove it.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc2bfad358b6223ada74284787612bf630013303\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc2bfad358b6223ada74284787612bf630013303/71_35_765_459/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Solution: a rhombus </strong>(a quadrilateral with four sides the same length). Simple geometry shows that the angles <em>a</em> + b = 90 degrees, so 2<em>a</em> + 2<em>b</em> = 180, a straight line</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17a7745c596aa5b557627ef963618f107295b7be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17a7745c596aa5b557627ef963618f107295b7be/0_0_808_425/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"263\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>2)<em> The<strong> same sheet </strong>is now folded<strong> </strong>again, this time increasing the amount folded over so that there is some overlap between the top and bottom flaps, illustrated below. This looks more realistic (it resembles the so-called \u2018Baronial style\u2019 envelope). By how much can the side flaps be made to overlap the top and bottom flaps, so that the rectangular envelope can be stuck down? Prove it.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95a1c8976e9a5c92b4fc7b6099ba3d45e78fd078\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a1c8976e9a5c92b4fc7b6099ba3d45e78fd078/38_0_745_447/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Solution: </strong>If the \u2018envelope\u2019 is still rectangular, the side flaps can <em>never</em> overlap the other flaps. They will perfectly fill the triangular gaps. You can see this by looking again at the solution diagram for (1). If you make the rectangle shorter and wider, keeping it centred, the angles <em>a </em>and <em>b </em>stay the same, so the edges of the flaps must still share the same lines. And if they do, the side flaps must fill the triangular gaps perfectly.</p> <p>3) <em>The \u2018envelope\u2019 from question (1) is now opened as below. Can you draw all the lines this image without taking your pencil off the paper, and without re-tracing or crossing over one of the lines you\u2019ve already drawn?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a4e3b738318725efd60cc601cf9eed81402208e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a4e3b738318725efd60cc601cf9eed81402208e/0_21_982_589/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bfaf596466421555572c458c2cad503fc91d9986\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfaf596466421555572c458c2cad503fc91d9986/0_19_445_329/445.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"445\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Solution. </strong>There are several ways to do it, one example is illustrated left, but you must always start at one of the bottom corners, because these are the only two junctions (nodes) with an odd number of lines. In this case the bottom two corners have three lines, and every other node has four lines.</p> <p>4) <em>Can you draw the image of the folded envelope from question (2) in the same way?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution: </strong>No it is not possible, because there are more than two nodes with an odd number of lines (there are four nodes with three lines each). You can only trace a path that never crosses or retraces a line (what\u2019s called an Euler path) if there are either two or zero \u2018odd\u2019 nodes.</p> <p>In today\u2019s other challenge I wrote that, in the 1970s, cornflakes packets had the following mnemonic:</p> <p><em>A litre of water\u2019s a pint and three-quarters.</em></p> <p>I invited you to come up with a version that converts the units the other way round (1 pint = 568ml).</p> <p>About 100 entries came in and in the opinion of the judges (me and Rob Eastaway, whose book <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2mAEGWV\">Maths on the Back of an Envelope</a></em> inspired the challenge) the two winners are the following. (We couldn\u2019t decide on a singe winner so we decided on two.)</p> <blockquote> <p><em>A pint of Pils is 568 mls</em></p> </blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\u201cHow many litres in a pint?\u201d someone tweeted</em></p> <p><em>Just think of the Steps song with the 7 deleted</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The first one (by Andrew Viner) scans, is to the point and memorable. The second one (by Bob Craddock) is less concise but funnier \u2013 and I like the fact that it describes the digits. Congratulations both! A copy of <em>Maths on the Back of an Envelope</em> on the way to you.</p> <p>Some of our other favourites are listed here:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>(1) A pint in heaven - leave out 7,</em></p> <p><em>At the pearly gate say 568</em></p> <p><em>(2) One pint o\u2019 waterz</em></p> <p><em>Juz taz neat az</em></p> <p><em>5 6 8 milly leetaz</em></p> <p><em>(3) A pint in Britain sounds much neater,</em></p> <p><em>than the Aussie equivalent: four sevenths of a litre</em></p> <p>Authors: Rose Murphy, David Thomas, and Dan Jessen (in Queensland)</p> </blockquote> <p>The next one has kudos for lateral thinking, but sadly doesn\u2019t rhyme.<em><br></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Smylers2/status/1176043589153021952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cA pint of ketchup is 57 cl.\u201d<br><br>Easy to remember, because it even has the number on the bottle! <a href=\"https://t.co/VpOg3PRr3S\">pic.twitter.com/VpOg3PRr3S</a></p>&mdash; Smylers (@Smylers2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Smylers2/status/1176043589153021952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 23, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Some other tweeted responses</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leighblue/status/1176112836852047873\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">4 litres of Scotch from Ocado on Monday;<br>A pint a day keeps me drunk until Sunday.</p>&mdash; Leigh Caldwell (@leighblue) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leighblue/status/1176112836852047873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 23, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AaronBoardley/status/1176116252202242049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">5 6 (no 7, and) 8<br>A pint of water to help you hydrate</p>&mdash; Aaron (@AaronBoardley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronBoardley/status/1176116252202242049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 23, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dwauctioneer/status/1176132870504701953\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A pint of water&#39;s half a litre.

      "bodyText": "Earlier today I set you four puzzles, and a challenge to devise a rhyme about a pint being 568ml. The solutions first and the best pint-sized poems afterwards. 1) A piece of paper is folded to make a shape that looks a bit like the back of an envelope, illustrated below. If the paper is unfolded again to make a flat sheet, what shape will it be? Prove it. Solution: a rhombus (a quadrilateral with four sides the same length). Simple geometry shows that the angles a + b = 90 degrees, so 2a + 2b = 180, a straight line 2) The same sheet is now folded again, this time increasing the amount folded over so that there is some overlap between the top and bottom flaps, illustrated below. This looks more realistic (it resembles the so-called \u2018Baronial style\u2019 envelope). By how much can the side flaps be made to overlap the top and bottom flaps, so that the rectangular envelope can be stuck down? Prove it. Solution: If the \u2018envelope\u2019 is still rectangular, the side flaps can never overlap the other flaps. They will perfectly fill the triangular gaps. You can see this by looking again at the solution diagram for (1). If you make the rectangle shorter and wider, keeping it centred, the angles a and b stay the same, so the edges of the flaps must still share the same lines. And if they do, the side flaps must fill the triangular gaps perfectly. 3) The \u2018envelope\u2019 from question (1) is now opened as below. Can you draw all the lines this image without taking your pencil off the paper, and without re-tracing or crossing over one of the lines you\u2019ve already drawn? Solution. There are several ways to do it, one example is illustrated left, but you must always start at one of the bottom corners, because these are the only two junctions (nodes) with an odd number of lines. In this case the bottom two corners have three lines, and every other node has four lines. 4) Can you draw the image of the folded envelope from question (2) in the same way? Solution: No it is not possible, because there are more than two nodes with an odd number of lines (there are four nodes with three lines each). You can only trace a path that never crosses or retraces a line (what\u2019s called an Euler path) if there are either two or zero \u2018odd\u2019 nodes. In today\u2019s other challenge I wrote that, in the 1970s, cornflakes packets had the following mnemonic: A litre of water\u2019s a pint and three-quarters. I invited you to come up with a version that converts the units the other way round (1 pint = 568ml). About 100 entries came in and in the opinion of the judges (me and Rob Eastaway, whose book Maths on the Back of an Envelope inspired the challenge) the two winners are the following. (We couldn\u2019t decide on a singe winner so we decided on two.) A pint of Pils is 568 mls and \u201cHow many litres in a pint?\u201d someone tweeted Just think of the Steps song with the 7 deleted The first one (by Andrew Viner) scans, is to the point and memorable. The second one (by Bob Craddock) is less concise but funnier \u2013 and I like the fact that it describes the digits. Congratulations both! A copy of Maths on the Back of an Envelope on the way to you. Some of our other favourites are listed here: (1) A pint in heaven - leave out 7, At the pearly gate say 568 (2) One pint o\u2019 waterz Juz taz neat az 5 6 8 milly leetaz (3) A pint in Britain sounds much neater, than the Aussie equivalent: four sevenths of a litre Authors: Rose Murphy, David Thomas, and Dan Jessen (in Queensland) The next one has kudos for lateral thinking, but sadly doesn\u2019t rhyme. Some other tweeted responses And finally\u2026. More great suggestions can be read below the line on the original post. Please continue adding new ones here. Thanks to Rob Eastaway for today\u2019s puzzles. His new book is Maths on the Back of an Envelope. He is also runs Maths Inspiration, a national programme of interactive maths lecture shows for teenagers. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.",

The men were in an area that is off-limits to hunters. A local police officer said that shortly after they set off on the hunt the men\u2019s two dogs started barking, signalling the presence of boar. The father is said to have mistakenly positioned himself in his son\u2019s path of fire. Amid the sound of barking and wild boar fleeing in the woods, the son saw a silhouette and started shooting. \u201cHe thought he had hit a boar but instead it was his father,\u201d the police officer said. \u201cHe immediately started to look for help \u2026 he was absolutely destroyed.\u201d Police charged the son with manslaughter and seized his guns. The pair, from Postiglione, a small town near the Alburni range, were also hunting before the official start of the hunting season on 2 October. The killing, which comes two months after the death of another hunter, who accidentally shot himself in the head, prompted animal rights groups to renew their calls for a ban on hunting. The same calls were made in October last year after 20-year-old Marco Tosti was killed after being mistaken for a wild boar by his hunting companion. Michela Vittoria Brambilla, a former government minister and president of the Italian League for the Defence of Animals and the Environment, said on Sunday: \u201cEnough with this wild west behaviour in the countryside and the forests. The authorities cannot continue to portray the high number of deaths and injuries as something natural and inevitable.\u201d",

Also, \u201cGet everyone in the office lunch,\u201d and \u201cLaugh at everything.\u201d I always ask a candidate that question in any job interview: you will buy me lunch, won\u2019t you? And laugh at your jokes. But this is clearly meant to be humorous. It may not quite be The Thick of It, but it\u2019s still quite funny (for a recruitment agency, at least). Not everyone thought so. Oh, dear. Who didn\u2019t? People online. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst advice I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said one person. \u201cPeople suck.\u201d Oh, God. People online suck, more like. What else did they say? \u201cThis should be titled: How to Make Sure Everyone Thinks You\u2019re a Serial Killer.\u201d A bit better. But surely no one took it to-the-letter seriously. And, if they did, they probably didn\u2019t deserve the job in the first place. Well, you\u2019d think it was obvious which bits were supposed to be tongue-in-cheek and there were loads of links to sensible advice, but after the backlash Reed decided to take it down. RIP Five Ways to Impress on Your First Day. Oh, no. I wondered why it was in the past tense. Maybe they sacked the person responsible for trying too hard. Do say: \u201cOn your first day, punctuality is the key to making a good impression from the get-go.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019m new here, you seem to be well-respected and important. Fancy a quickie in the stationery cupboard?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government has issued a salmonella warning after an investigation revealed that at least 100 people had been poisoned by British eggs in three years. On Saturday, following the joint investigation, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued a food alert, warning consumers that eggs from a specific English flock could be contaminated with salmonella. The eggs in question were marked with the British Lion stamp, which is supposed to guarantee they are safe. Salmonella can cause food poisoning, and in the most severe cases can be fatal. There have been no deaths in this outbreak. Previously the FSA had insisted British Lion eggs were safe to eat raw, even for pregnant women, children and the elderly. It has now emerged that regulations designed to ensure high standards in the UK egg sector were breached several thousand times by farms, packing stations and wholesalers over the last three years, according to records seen by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Guardian. Inspection records have shown that more than a hundred tests for salmonella had been missed, or carried out too late, increasing the chance of contaminated eggs entering the food chain. Over three years egg farms in England had more than 100 breaches of the rules around the government\u2019s programme to prevent salmonella. Some offending farms were issued with penalty notices, which can result in a fine or other enforcement action. The records \u2013 compiled by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) \u2013 also show that one in six of all inspections carried out in the past three years found infractions on issues including hygiene, animal welfare and egg quality. Ensuring farms are regularly cleaned and disinfected, alongside strict pest control and biosecurity measures, is key to preventing salmonella, which can be spread by contaminated wild birds and animals, in water, and via farm workers. A single lapse in hygiene could introduce salmonella on to a farm or enable the pathogens to spread, industry sources have said. Last week an investigation revealed how a major outbreak of one of the worst strains of salmonella had affected several farms and two egg-packing factories, including one that supplies major supermarkets. More than 50 egg-laying flocks were found to have tested positive for salmonella since January 2018, 11 of them contaminated with the most serious strains of the bacteria. Egg-packing factories were also found contaminated on five occasions in the period. Almost all of the 13bn eggs eaten in the UK come from British farms. More than half of the market comes from free-range hens, while most of the rest is from birds in \u201cenriched cages\u201d \u2013 indoor enclosures for dozens of birds with perching spaces and scratching areas. The salmonella outbreak revealed by the Bureau is understood to have affected some free-range egg farms. The government confirmed on Friday that it was \u201cinvestigating and taking action\u201d to control the outbreak along with industry and local authorities. In its food alert the FSA said there was a \u201cpotential but low risk of illness\u201d and advised people to cook their eggs thoroughly to eliminate the bug. A spokesperson for the APHA said: \u201cAll egg producers are subject to rigorous and regular inspections to ensure standards are being met and to minimise the risk to public health.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier has described Boris Johnson\u2019s solution for replacing the Irish backstop as \u201cunacceptable\u201d as the EU\u2019s chief negotiator gave his most downbeat assessment yet of the chances of striking a Brexit deal by 31 October. Standing alongside the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas following a meeting in Berlin, Barnier said the UK government\u2019s position had to change for there to be any hope of success. The British prime minister had declared on his way to New York for the UN general assembly that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d he could persuade key EU leaders to accept his proposals for the Irish border. Johnson wants to find agreement on a deal ahead of an EU summit on 17 October that he can put to parliament in order for the UK to leave the bloc at the end of the month. But as he sought to break the Brexit impasse by appealing to EU capitals and the European council\u2019s president, Donald Tusk, Barnier appeared to scotch any hope of a rethink in Brussels. The EU insists it will not sign up to a deal that creates a regulatory and customs border on the island of Ireland, as proposed by the UK in the papers tabled last week by the government\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost. Barnier said: \u201cThe new government of the UK wants us to get rid of this solution, the so-called backstop and wants \u2026 a regulatory and customs land border on the island of Ireland. \u201cThe UK government also wants the EU to change the way the internal market and border control operates after Brexit. \u201cAs I am sure you will understand, this is unacceptable. My mandate is clear of the 27 leaders, the EU and the European parliament, safeguarding peace and stability in Ireland and protecting the integrity of the single market. \u201cLet me therefore put it clearly that based on current UK thinking, it is difficult to see how we arrive at a legally operable solution that fulfils all the objectives of the backstop.\u201d Barnier went on to insist the EU was open to \u201cnew ideas\u201d should they be proposed. But he added that the talks were in a \u201cvery difficult sensitive phase\u201d. \u201cThe ball is in the court of the British,\u201d he added. The UK government has proposed maintaining an all-Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone for agrifood products to ensure that the flow of 30% by value of the trade across the border is unimpeded. The EU has said this \u201cpartial\u201d solution does not avoid additional customs and VAT checks on the island of Ireland nor deal with the issue of manufactured goods that cross the border after Brexit. The backstop in the withdrawal agreement would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory in order to maintain peace, protect the north-south economy and avoid border infrastructure of even additional related checks. Of the UK\u2019s suggestion that customs paperwork could be done away from the border and that technology and trusted trade schemes could facilitate the necessary checks, Barnier and Maas raised doubts. \u201cObjectively, there are possibilities,\u201d Barnier said, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to inspect a cow with virtual methods.\u201d Maas said it was \u201cprogress\u201d that the UK had at least made some proposals, but that \u201ceven from a British point of view these presented ideas are not a legal and viable solution\u201d. He added: \u201cI have never believed that digitalisation can solve all problems \u2026 In the future what we will do is create a European position to this in close consultation with Michel Barnier. At this moment, all we can say is just that the suggestions are not legal or viable solutions as they have been agreed on in the exit agreement.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s something special about Giselle. Ever since its gas-lit premiere in 1841 at the Paris Opera, audiences have thrilled to the spectral sights and emotional heights of this romantic ballet. Dancers still covet the so-called Hamlet of ballerina roles \u2013 that of a lovestruck peasant girl who goes mad and dies of grief after discovering she\u2019s been duped by her well-born beau, only to join the undead ranks of the Wilis, a white-clad corps de ballet of vengeful female spirits intent on dancing faithless men to death.</p> <p>Originally choreographed by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot, later revised in Russia by imperial ballet master Marius Petipa, the tale has proven creative catnip for choreographers seeking to reimagine the romantic classic around more contemporary concerns. This autumn, three Giselles are on tour in the UK. In addition to Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s traditional production, English National Ballet are reviving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/28/giselle-review-akram-khan-english-national-ballet\">Akram Khan\u2019s 2016 version</a>, which transposes medieval feudalism into a late-capitalist world of migrant workers exploited by a conspicuously hedonistic elite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98adb677008e79fbce72bf6aa06ae98a2f96ee7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98adb677008e79fbce72bf6aa06ae98a2f96ee7a/0_308_4626_2776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stina Quagebeur (Myrtha) and Jeffrey Cirio (Hilarion) in Giselle by Akram Khan at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stina Quagebeur (Myrtha) and Jeffrey Cirio (Hilarion) in Giselle by Akram Khan at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ferocity is to the fore in South African choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/18/swan-lake-review-dada-masilo-sadlers-wells\">Dada Masilo</a>\u2019s Giselle. \u201cI\u2019d always been intrigued by the Wilis. I wanted to make them dangerous and scary,\u201d says Masilo, whose previous works include reinventions of classics such as Swan Lake, Romeo &amp; Juliet and Carmen. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be vicious, wronged spirits that kill, but you don\u2019t really see that in the ballet version because it\u2019s so graceful and pretty and pure and white.\u201d</p> <p>Clothed in full, blood-red skirts and moving with a \u201cstaccato, into-the-ground\u201d physicality derived from the complex rhythms of traditional South African dance, Masilo\u2019s mixed-gender Wilis skew the original vision of jilted, wraithlike femininity. \u201cI wanted to break the stereotype that only women get hurt. Men get hurt too.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz-YisMzDvE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hz-YisMzDvE?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The work\u2019s androgynous aesthetic is further embodied in the figure of Myrtha, leader of the Wilis. Instead of an imperious queen, Masilo\u2019s Myrtha is a traditional healer who makes sure Albrecht \u2013 Giselle\u2019s already-betrothed aristocratic sweetheart who\u2019s been posing as a peasant \u2013 dances to his death. In the ballet, it\u2019s Giselle\u2019s blundering suitor Hilarion who jigs himself to oblivion, while Giselle persuades her spectral sisters to have mercy on the guilt-stricken Albrecht. There\u2019s no such clemency from Masilo. Her Giselle shares the anger of her ghostly cohort.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Albrecht deserves to be forgiven,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat he does to Giselle is appalling. I think we live in a world where women are expected to be understanding, forgiving, innocent and loving. I didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d She\u2019s not promoting an eye-for-an-eye ethos but rather following the narrative with an insistence on equality. \u201cWe need to stand our ground and say it\u2019s not OK.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of #MeToo, have audiences responded positively to this reconstruction? \u201cA lot of men don\u2019t like the fact that I kill off Albrecht. It seems like it\u2019s directed at them but it\u2019s not. A lot of the women are going \u2018yeah, women power!\u2019 but that\u2019s not really why I did it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0d6d866ded0f11d0c567984f93e4f91ba8ac013\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0d6d866ded0f11d0c567984f93e4f91ba8ac013/0_0_5330_3847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalia Osipova in Giselle by the Royal Ballet in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalia Osipova in Giselle by the Royal Ballet in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Masilo is determined to make a social point when it comes to the protagonist\u2019s breakdown.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s something special about Giselle. Ever since its gas-lit premiere in 1841 at the Paris Opera, audiences have thrilled to the spectral sights and emotional heights of this romantic ballet. Dancers still covet the so-called Hamlet of ballerina roles \u2013 that of a lovestruck peasant girl who goes mad and dies of grief after discovering she\u2019s been duped by her well-born beau, only to join the undead ranks of the Wilis, a white-clad corps de ballet of vengeful female spirits intent on dancing faithless men to death. Originally choreographed by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot, later revised in Russia by imperial ballet master Marius Petipa, the tale has proven creative catnip for choreographers seeking to reimagine the romantic classic around more contemporary concerns. This autumn, three Giselles are on tour in the UK. In addition to Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s traditional production, English National Ballet are reviving Akram Khan\u2019s 2016 version, which transposes medieval feudalism into a late-capitalist world of migrant workers exploited by a conspicuously hedonistic elite. Ferocity is to the fore in South African choreographer Dada Masilo\u2019s Giselle. \u201cI\u2019d always been intrigued by the Wilis. I wanted to make them dangerous and scary,\u201d says Masilo, whose previous works include reinventions of classics such as Swan Lake, Romeo &amp; Juliet and Carmen. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be vicious, wronged spirits that kill, but you don\u2019t really see that in the ballet version because it\u2019s so graceful and pretty and pure and white.\u201d Clothed in full, blood-red skirts and moving with a \u201cstaccato, into-the-ground\u201d physicality derived from the complex rhythms of traditional South African dance, Masilo\u2019s mixed-gender Wilis skew the original vision of jilted, wraithlike femininity. \u201cI wanted to break the stereotype that only women get hurt. Men get hurt too.\u201d The work\u2019s androgynous aesthetic is further embodied in the figure of Myrtha, leader of the Wilis. Instead of an imperious queen, Masilo\u2019s Myrtha is a traditional healer who makes sure Albrecht \u2013 Giselle\u2019s already-betrothed aristocratic sweetheart who\u2019s been posing as a peasant \u2013 dances to his death. In the ballet, it\u2019s Giselle\u2019s blundering suitor Hilarion who jigs himself to oblivion, while Giselle persuades her spectral sisters to have mercy on the guilt-stricken Albrecht. There\u2019s no such clemency from Masilo. Her Giselle shares the anger of her ghostly cohort. \u201cI don\u2019t think Albrecht deserves to be forgiven,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat he does to Giselle is appalling. I think we live in a world where women are expected to be understanding, forgiving, innocent and loving. I didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d She\u2019s not promoting an eye-for-an-eye ethos but rather following the narrative with an insistence on equality. \u201cWe need to stand our ground and say it\u2019s not OK.\u201d In the wake of #MeToo, have audiences responded positively to this reconstruction? \u201cA lot of men don\u2019t like the fact that I kill off Albrecht. It seems like it\u2019s directed at them but it\u2019s not. A lot of the women are going \u2018yeah, women power!\u2019 but that\u2019s not really why I did it.\u201d Masilo is determined to make a social point when it comes to the protagonist\u2019s breakdown. This Giselle is shunned by her community. \u201cIn Johannesburg \u2013 not just there of course \u2013 people are afraid of what they don\u2019t understand. If somebody is mentally ill, people will tend to shy away from them. Look at what has happened with HIV and Aids. People aren\u2019t educated about the disease and they reject the person who\u2019s ill. There\u2019s that stigma.\u201d She drew on a personal experience to shape Giselle\u2019s solitary grief. \u201cMy aunt \u2013 I always say she died of heartbreak, but she had Aids and my family alienated her because they were ashamed.\u201d It\u2019s easy to be cynical about the classic\u2019s storybook quaintness, but it can still surprise and challenge, with its famous \u2018mad scene\u2019 a real test of a ballerina\u2019s acting abilities, especially to post-Freudian eyes. In recent years, the giddy speed and unnerving intensity of Natalia Osipova\u2019s dancing in Act 1 suggests that her Giselle is untethered to reality from the beginning. Even within the confines of the choreographic text and traditional narrative there\u2019s space for subtle shading. In order to capture Giselle\u2019s ethereal drift in Act 2, Birmingham Royal Ballet principal Momoko Hirata imagines \u201cwalking on something very fragile\u201d, using very worn-in pointe shoes. Even with abundant technique at their fingertips, today\u2019s dancers might still struggle to embody what\u2019s perceived as an authentic Romantic softness. \u201cTo get the old-fashioned angle of the neck right \u2026 I\u2019m still searching for that,\u201d says Hirata.

      "body": "<p>Antonio Conte never went home on Tuesday night. He was too angry \u2013 too \u201cseriously pissed off\u201d, in his own words \u2013 to imagine that he could get a good night\u2019s sleep after Inter\u2019s Champions League draw with Slavia Prague, so he went directly from San Siro back to his club\u2019s training ground instead. The only way to work through his frustrations was to work.</p> \n<p>\u201cHead down and keep pedalling.\u201d That was the mantra Conte gave at his introductory Inter press conference in July and which he has returned to several times since. A little cheesy, for a man who accused his critics of speaking in cliches when they brought up his history of underwhelming European results this week, but you could not accuse him of failing to practice what he preaches.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/european-roundup-bayern-munich-bundesliga-barcelona-la-liga\">European roundup: Lukaku seals Milan derby win as Ramsey scores for Juve</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Conte knew his team would need to pedal especially hard during this congested early section of the fixture list. Inter had four days to prepare for the season\u2019s first Derby della Madonnina. Milan, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/28/milan-banned-from-europa-league-for-one-year-after-ffp-breach\" title=\"\">their suspension from European competition</a>, were getting the full week.</p> \n<p>The Rossoneri had been given a contrasting mission statement by their new manager, Marco Giampaolo, this summer. Hearing Conte\u2019s plans for the Nerazzurri, he responded that he would tell his players to keep their \u201cheads up and play football\u201d.</p> \n<p>On paper both men had made encouraging starts. Inter had taken maximum points. Milan had won two out of three.</p> \n<p>Performances, though, were another matter. Inter were grateful to a red card for Rodrigo De Paul for giving them the breathing space they needed to recover from a rough start against Udinese. Milan, across all of their games, had mustered a total of five shots on target. At least Conte\u2019s team seemed to be taking on a measure of his personality.</p> \n<p>Inter were dreadful against Slavia Prague yet stole a draw, and almost an injury-time win, through tenaciousness alone. It was hard to identify such clear evidence of Giampaolo\u2019s footballing philosophy at Milan.</p> \n<p>He arrived with a reputation for attacking excellence: the man who helped Fabio Quagliarella to become Serie A\u2019s top scorer at 36 years old. His role in that story might have been overblown. The striker told DAZN last week that Giampaolo had spoken to him \u201cfive or six times in three seasons\u201d.</p> \n<p>Less ambiguous was Giampaolo\u2019s preference for a 4-3-1-2. Milan spent the whole summer preparing to play in that formation, only to abandon it after a single game, the manager observing that Krzysztof Piatek was better suited to playing as a lone striker.</p> \n<p>After watching his No 9 continue to underwhelm in a new system, he flip-flopped back to his original plan on Saturday against Inter.</p> \n<p>It made little difference. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/sep/21/milan-v-inter-serie-a-live\" title=\"\">Milan were stodgy</a>, and Piatek a peripheral figure, in a derby that never threatened to live up to the choreography that preceded it.</p> \n<p>Before kick-off, fans of the Rossoneri had displayed a gargantuan image of Saint Ambrose \u2013 a fourth-century Bishop of Milan \u2013 stamping on Inter\u2019s serpent in the Curva Sud. \u201cFaith in the devil,\u201d read the accompanying text.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe legend gives us a story born of fantasy and imagination, but reality teaches us that even the protector fell into temptation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbb80ed75d7d35ceb81ce3c59592889dce521e2c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbb80ed75d7d35ceb81ce3c59592889dce521e2c/0_29_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milan\u2019s head coach Marco Giampaolo gives instructions to his players during the derby defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milan\u2019s head coach Marco Giampaolo gives instructions to his players during the derby defeat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matteo Bazzi/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How those same supporters might have craved just a dash of fantasy, though, as they surveyed the action in midfield. Where Inter could call on the dynamism of two brilliant summer signings, Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Stefano Sensi, Giampaolo had selected only Lucas Biglia, Franck Kessi\u00e9 and Hakan Calhanoglu, with Suso ahead of them in the No 10 role.</p> \n<p>It might as well have been a team picked by Giampaolo\u2019s predecessor, Gennaro Gattuso. At least he would have known better than to believe Suso would have the discipline to occupy Marcelo Brozovic in the defensive phase of the game.

      "bodyText": "Antonio Conte never went home on Tuesday night. He was too angry \u2013 too \u201cseriously pissed off\u201d, in his own words \u2013 to imagine that he could get a good night\u2019s sleep after Inter\u2019s Champions League draw with Slavia Prague, so he went directly from San Siro back to his club\u2019s training ground instead. The only way to work through his frustrations was to work. \u201cHead down and keep pedalling.\u201d That was the mantra Conte gave at his introductory Inter press conference in July and which he has returned to several times since. A little cheesy, for a man who accused his critics of speaking in cliches when they brought up his history of underwhelming European results this week, but you could not accuse him of failing to practice what he preaches. Conte knew his team would need to pedal especially hard during this congested early section of the fixture list. Inter had four days to prepare for the season\u2019s first Derby della Madonnina. Milan, thanks to their suspension from European competition, were getting the full week. The Rossoneri had been given a contrasting mission statement by their new manager, Marco Giampaolo, this summer. Hearing Conte\u2019s plans for the Nerazzurri, he responded that he would tell his players to keep their \u201cheads up and play football\u201d. On paper both men had made encouraging starts. Inter had taken maximum points. Milan had won two out of three. Performances, though, were another matter. Inter were grateful to a red card for Rodrigo De Paul for giving them the breathing space they needed to recover from a rough start against Udinese. Milan, across all of their games, had mustered a total of five shots on target. At least Conte\u2019s team seemed to be taking on a measure of his personality. Inter were dreadful against Slavia Prague yet stole a draw, and almost an injury-time win, through tenaciousness alone. It was hard to identify such clear evidence of Giampaolo\u2019s footballing philosophy at Milan. He arrived with a reputation for attacking excellence: the man who helped Fabio Quagliarella to become Serie A\u2019s top scorer at 36 years old. His role in that story might have been overblown. The striker told DAZN last week that Giampaolo had spoken to him \u201cfive or six times in three seasons\u201d. Less ambiguous was Giampaolo\u2019s preference for a 4-3-1-2. Milan spent the whole summer preparing to play in that formation, only to abandon it after a single game, the manager observing that Krzysztof Piatek was better suited to playing as a lone striker. After watching his No 9 continue to underwhelm in a new system, he flip-flopped back to his original plan on Saturday against Inter. It made little difference. Milan were stodgy, and Piatek a peripheral figure, in a derby that never threatened to live up to the choreography that preceded it. Before kick-off, fans of the Rossoneri had displayed a gargantuan image of Saint Ambrose \u2013 a fourth-century Bishop of Milan \u2013 stamping on Inter\u2019s serpent in the Curva Sud. \u201cFaith in the devil,\u201d read the accompanying text. \u201cThe legend gives us a story born of fantasy and imagination, but reality teaches us that even the protector fell into temptation.\u201d How those same supporters might have craved just a dash of fantasy, though, as they surveyed the action in midfield. Where Inter could call on the dynamism of two brilliant summer signings, Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Stefano Sensi, Giampaolo had selected only Lucas Biglia, Franck Kessi\u00e9 and Hakan Calhanoglu, with Suso ahead of them in the No 10 role. It might as well have been a team picked by Giampaolo\u2019s predecessor, Gennaro Gattuso. At least he would have known better than to believe Suso would have the discipline to occupy Marcelo Brozovic in the defensive phase of the game. The Spaniard started central but drifted right soon enough, seeking the time on the ball that he craves. Where were Milan\u2019s own new signings? Isma\u00ebl Bennacer was named player of the tournament at this summer\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, while Rade Krunic contributed five goals and seven assists last season for Empoli from midfield. They were signed this summer specifically to address the club\u2019s shortage of creativity, yet they have started only one game between them thus far. Rafael Le\u00e3o, the one summer addition who did make it into Giampaolo\u2019s derby XI, was their best outfield performer: at least offering moments of invention on the left \u2013 and especially once his fellow new arrival Theo Hern\u00e1ndez joined him on that flank. Besides them, only the goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma emerged with credit. Brozovic opened the scoring after 49 minutes. Barella then crossed for Romelu Lukaku to make it 2-0 in the 78th. Inter were hardly overwhelming yet they controlled the game in midfield and took their chances eventually, after a first half in which it seemed like Saint Ambrose himself was at work to thwart his near namesake Danilo D\u2019Ambrosio. Victory moved Inter back to the top of the table, extending their perfect start. It also allowed for a speedy rapprochement between Brozovic and Lukaku, who celebrated together after reports of a heated argument at half-time during the draw with Slavia Prague. \u201cIf that happens sometimes, I welcome it,\u201d said Conte at full-time on Sunday. \u201cI only hope that in future there are fewer news leaks, that would mean we\u2019ve grown.\u201d Better to grow from a position of strength.

But what if I told you it will reunite Jennifer Aniston with Reese Witherspoon, the woman who played her spoilt little sister Jill in Friends? Still no? Fair enough.</p> <h2>22. The One With Ross\u2019s New Girlfriend</h2> <p>After deciding to tell Ross about her feelings for him, Rachel is staggered to see that Ross has a new girlfriend and, in response, gets off with a terrible Italian man. Fun fact: this was the first episode of a new season, and the cast looked so dramatically different from the previous year the writers had to squeeze in an entire plot explaining why.</p> <h2>21.

Oh, you beautiful little weirdo!\u201d). Notable for being one of the only episodes where Ross thinks about other people.</p> <h2>20.

The One With the Blackout</h2> <p>The plan was for NBC to run four episodes of four shows, all set during the same blackout. Mad About You complied. Madman of the People complied. Friends complied, resulting in the episode where Chandler gets trapped in an ATM with Jill Goodacre. Seinfeld did not comply. Seinfeld is the best.</p> <h2>18.

The One With Ross\u2019s Grant</h2> <p>Where Ross loses his girlfriend to her ex and he just stands there watching. My theory is that, had Friends been made in 2019, Ross would spend most of his time on Reddit. Maybe when the reunion happens.</p> <h2>16. The One Where Ross Dates a Student</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lV52N674sQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_lV52N674sQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The One Where Ross Dates a Student.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ross is so creepy.

The One Where Heckles Dies</h2> <p>A neighbour of the friends suddenly passes away and this moment manages to teach many of them important lessons about their lives. So, you know, at least his death wasn\u2019t in vain.</p> <h2>13. The One Where Everybody Finds Out</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YbTIJsI5S0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8YbTIJsI5S0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The One Where Everybody Finds Out.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Frasier was better than Friends \u2013 don\u2019t argue, it was \u2013 but this was Friends at its most Frasierest. Chandler and Monica are dating, and the rest of the gang all know to some degree, but they don\u2019t know how much the others know. A beautifully-plotted episode that ends with Ross watching his sister have sex. Which is very Ross.</p> <h2>12. The One With Ross\u2019s Step Forward</h2> <p>Ross has a girlfriend he doesn\u2019t love, but he tells her he loves her anyway because he is weak. He gives her the keys to his apartment then changes the locks because he is weak. Rachel wants to have sex with Ross because she is silly.</p> <h2>11. The One With the Male Nanny</h2> <p>The one where Phoebe is going out with Paul Rudd then kisses someone who isn\u2019t Paul Rudd, because she wouldn\u2019t know a good thing if it pushed her under a steamroller.</p> <h2>10.

It\u2019s arguably one of Matt LeBlanc\u2019s finest performances and therefore one of the episodes that got the spinoff Joey made, so therefore the worst episode of Friends. Also, Ross gets angry about a sandwich, because of course he does.</p> <h2>9. The One Where Ross is Fine</h2> <p>By this point, more out of boredom than anything else, Joey and Rachel are together. This is the episode where Ross discovers the betrayal and has a minor nervous breakdown (\u201cE is for how extremely normal I find it that you two are together!\u201d). Looking back, it was a real shame that Friends ended a year before The Game was published. Ross would have loved that.</p> <h2>8. The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhMPmt5hyVc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GhMPmt5hyVc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In which Rachel asks Ross what his deepest sexual fantasy is and he replies that it\u2019s a woman in a bikini from a film made for children to enjoy. God, Ross is the worst.</p> <h2>7. The One With Ross\u2019s Library Book</h2> <p>Where Ross gets so protective about the area in a library that contains his doctoral dissertation that he pretty much flat-out becomes a vigilante to ensure it\u2019s treated with adequate respect. Did I mention that Ross was the worst?</p> <h2>6. The One With Russ</h2> <p>Where Rachel starts dating someone who looks like Ross, acts like Ross and has a name that sounds similar to Ross.</p> <h2>5. The One Where Eddie Won\u2019t Go</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJEO1HfcK-0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wJEO1HfcK-0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The One Where Eddie Won\u2019t Go.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Eddie was the best character ever to appear on Friends, for having an abrasive streak that wasn\u2019t usually present in the series. In this episode, Chandler throws Eddie out of the apartment after waking up to see him standing over him. He chooses to do this by gaslighting Eddie; a nice reminder that, while Ross is the worst, Chandler is a pretty close second.</p> <h2>4.

      "bodyText": "Twenty-five years ago, a sitcom debuted on NBC. Starring a clutch of beautiful yet little-known starlets, the sitcom was envisioned as a line in the sand for young Generation X-ers. This was their show, discussing the things they wanted to hear about. It was vital. It was epochal. The sitcom was called Madman of the People, and it was cancelled after one season after reviews called it \u201cimpoverished\u201d and \u201cnoxious\u201d. However, the show that debuted one hour before Madman of the People was Friends \u2013 a sitcom that became so staggeringly popular it still qualifies as one of Netflix\u2019s most watched shows. What better way to celebrate this anniversary than picking through all 236 Friends episodes to find the funniest 25? 25. The One in Vegas Season five\u2019s double-length finale might be best known for yanking the Ross/Rachel will they/won\u2019t they thread until it all but snapped \u2013 it\u2019s where they get drunk and get married \u2013 but don\u2019t forget it\u2019s also the one where Joey discovers his hand twin. 24. The One Where Ross Got High The episode where Chandler and Monica announce their relationship to Monica\u2019s parents and where Rachel makes a trifle with meat in it. 23. The One With Rachel\u2019s Sister Nobody in the world wants to watch Apple\u2019s new series The Morning Show. But what if I told you it will reunite Jennifer Aniston with Reese Witherspoon, the woman who played her spoilt little sister Jill in Friends? Still no? Fair enough. 22. The One With Ross\u2019s New Girlfriend After deciding to tell Ross about her feelings for him, Rachel is staggered to see that Ross has a new girlfriend and, in response, gets off with a terrible Italian man. Fun fact: this was the first episode of a new season, and the cast looked so dramatically different from the previous year the writers had to squeeze in an entire plot explaining why. 21. The One With Ross\u2019s Inappropriate Song The episode where Ross and Rachel stop baby Emma crying by explaining how sexually attracted they are to large buttocks (\u201cYou really do like big butts, don\u2019t you? Oh, you beautiful little weirdo!\u201d). Notable for being one of the only episodes where Ross thinks about other people. 20. The One With Chandler in a Box Where Monica almost blinds herself to the extent that she kisses the son of a man she used to go out with, and Chandler sits in a box. 19. The One With the Blackout The plan was for NBC to run four episodes of four shows, all set during the same blackout. Mad About You complied. Madman of the People complied. Friends complied, resulting in the episode where Chandler gets trapped in an ATM with Jill Goodacre. Seinfeld did not comply. Seinfeld is the best. 18. The One With Ross\u2019s Teeth Ross tries to alter his body but too much, part one. 17. The One With Ross\u2019s Grant Where Ross loses his girlfriend to her ex and he just stands there watching. My theory is that, had Friends been made in 2019, Ross would spend most of his time on Reddit. Maybe when the reunion happens. 16. The One Where Ross Dates a Student Ross is so creepy. Take this episode, where he uses his position of power to date a girl much younger than him. When the reunion happens, there will be an episode of Friends where Ross spends the whole time downvoting movie trailers with female leads. 15. The One With Unagi Not that there\u2019s a theme here or anything, but this is the episode where Ross mansplains karate a lot then goes out of his way to truly frighten a couple of women to prove a point. 14. The One Where Heckles Dies A neighbour of the friends suddenly passes away and this moment manages to teach many of them important lessons about their lives. So, you know, at least his death wasn\u2019t in vain. 13. The One Where Everybody Finds Out Frasier was better than Friends \u2013 don\u2019t argue, it was \u2013 but this was Friends at its most Frasierest. Chandler and Monica are dating, and the rest of the gang all know to some degree, but they don\u2019t know how much the others know.

The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy In which Rachel asks Ross what his deepest sexual fantasy is and he replies that it\u2019s a woman in a bikini from a film made for children to enjoy. God, Ross is the worst. 7.

Did I mention that Ross was the worst? 6. The One With Russ Where Rachel starts dating someone who looks like Ross, acts like Ross and has a name that sounds similar to Ross. 5. The One Where Eddie Won\u2019t Go Eddie was the best character ever to appear on Friends, for having an abrasive streak that wasn\u2019t usually present in the series. In this episode, Chandler throws Eddie out of the apartment after waking up to see him standing over him. He chooses to do this by gaslighting Eddie; a nice reminder that, while Ross is the worst, Chandler is a pretty close second. 4. The One With the Jellyfish One day, our ancestors will realise that people who had been stung by jellyfish liked to urinate all over themselves and they will trace it all back to this episode. It doesn\u2019t even work. Trust me. 3. The One With Ross\u2019s Tan Ross tries to alter his body but too much, part two. \u201cOh my God, you can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!\u201d 2. The One Where Ross Can\u2019t Flirt In which Ross opens the door to a woman to discuss the smells of different types of gas until she runs away in a fit of abject panic. Oh Ross, you genuinely troubled man. 1. The One With the Prom Video A truly great episode that manages to flit from comedy to heartbreak to romance with barely a change in gears.

      "bodyText": "Indigenous leaders in Brazil have denounced Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201ccolonialist and ethnocidal\u201d policies as the far-right populist headed to New York to defend his treatment of the Amazon and its inhabitants. Bolsonaro is set to make the opening speech at the UN general assembly on Tuesday morning after a wretched few weeks for Brazil\u2019s international reputation in which reports of soaring deforestation and his response to the Amazon fires have cemented his reputation as South America\u2019s \u201cCaptain Chainsaw\u201d. Brazil\u2019s president is expected to use his UN debut to launch a Trumpian assault on the left and push back against foreign criticism of his treatment of Brazil\u2019s environment and indigenous communities. He has recruited a rare pro-Bolsonaro indigenous voice, Ysani Kalapalo, to travel with him to New York in an effort to soften his notoriety as a rainforest destroyer. But in a strongly worded open letter, 16 indigenous leaders from Brazil\u2019s Xingu indigenous park spurned Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201ccolonialist and ethnocidal\u201d programme for their communities, which he has pledged to open for commercial exploitation. The leaders claimed the sole interest of Kalapalo \u2013 who recorded a recent video denying Bolsonaro was to blame for the Amazon fires \u2013 was to \u201cinsult and demoralize Brazil\u2019s indigenous leaders and movement\u201d on social media. \u201cNot content with its attacks on indigenous peoples, the Brazilian government now seeks to legitimize its anti-indigenous policies by using an indigenous figure who sympathizes with its radical ideologies,\u201d they added. In a recent article for the Guardian, the Xingu\u2019s best-known leader, Raoni Metuktire, accused Bolsonaro of doing nothing to stop ranchers invading indigenous lands. Bolsonaro\u2019s UN appearance will represent the culmination of a government propaganda drive designed to repair Brazil\u2019s global image and fend off the threat of economic sanctions. \u201cWe are not the villain of the environment,\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, insisted during an interview in New York. But observers are awaiting Bolsonaro\u2019s speech \u2013 which one commentator expected to focus on the issues of \u201csovereignty, liberalism, communism/left, Christianity and the Amazon\u201d \u2013 with considerable trepidation.

It makes you want to be candid too. \u201cI\u2019m jetlagged,\u201d I text back. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll even out.\u201d</p> <p>Next month, Walker will become the fifth artist to take on the Hyundai commission at Tate Modern \u2013 creating a large, site-specific work in the vast Turbine Hall that\u2019s bound to get people chattering about black art, continuing the success of such grand London exhibitions as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/16/soul-of-a-nation-art-in-the-age-of-black-power-tate-modern-review\">Soul of a Nation</a>, about the black power era in the US, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/11/get-up-stand-up-now-somerset-house-ajamu-zak-horace-ove\">Get Up, Stand Up Now</a>, which celebrated black British culture over the past 50 years.</p> <p>Walker\u2019s work immediately calls into question what black art could and should be, and whether it should even be categorised in such a way. Her work is about power, pain and pleasure, often told through the framework of black characters caught in subservient, perverse relationships and existences in the antebellum, or pre-civil war, American south. Born in 1969 in Stockton, California, Walker plunged into notoriety in the 1990s after studying at Rhode Island School of Design. Viewed as a whipsmart upstart, she made controversial cut-paper silhouettes of black figures that arguably played into racist caricatures \u2013 and won her the MacArthur Foundation\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d award in 1997.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59ed40f81823e2ac01c46559e29e00c1a27934e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59ed40f81823e2ac01c46559e29e00c1a27934e9/0_0_2989_2167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sphinx \u2026 A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sphinx \u2026 A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby, an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kara Walker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But her craft, almost always monochrome, extends to etching, sketching and even sugarwork. She is now perhaps best known for A Subtlety, the completely unsubtle, giant, curvaceous sugar sphinx she constructed in 2014 at a disused sugar factory in Brooklyn, which drew such visitors as Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. The most consistent aspect of her work is its ability to latch on to you and unsettle you. The pouted lips of a black woman may be slightly engorged, the head of a baby rolling its eyes back might be slipping out of a vagina, a slave may be poised to chop off an arm. They\u2019re like the unwanted, distressing thoughts that burrow into your head at night-time. </p> <p>When Walker greets me at the door of her huge, industrial studio, she is warm and accommodating. I\u2019m immediately confronted by one of her biggest works, the towering Katastw\u00f3f Karavan. A beast of a thing, created as part of the Prospect.4 triennial in New Orleans, it once sat on the banks of the Mississippi and depicts a particularly ominous scene of dancing, marching figures draped in vegetation. Next to the Karavan, Walker is petite, wearing a slick of iridescent blue eyeliner. Her trousers match her eyes \u2013 blue and tight. Her afro, speckled with silver, is tied into small, tight crops of curls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1b9590699466f9245f05bfa657066f23fd1dee0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b9590699466f9245f05bfa657066f23fd1dee0/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Katastw\u00f3f Karavan \u2026 her steam calliope organ with marching figures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Katastw\u00f3f Karavan \u2026 her steam calliope organ with marching figures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kara Walker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We sit in the small outside garden, our interview soundtracked by the faint rustling of papery-leaved trees and the unsettling whine of New York\u2019s emergency services.

When I ask what the last thing was to make her really happy, she says: \u201cMade me really happy? I keep being really sad.\u201d But then she laughs and tells me about being off the beaten track in Greece earlier this summer, and finding herself at a children\u2019s play park in a tiny village, where she came across a ride made out of four plastic swans.</p> <p>\u201cThat ride and everything about that little theme park was so sincere and so rinky-dink and just on the edge of depression,\u201d she says, smiling again. \u201cI revere that edge.\u201d Then she seems to remember my question and spells out her philosophy: \u201cToe the line, get on the swan ride, look at the blinky lights and be happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Kara Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall Commission is at Tate Modern, London, 2 October to 5 April.

I keep being really sad.\u201d But then she laughs and tells me about being off the beaten track in Greece earlier this summer, and finding herself at a children\u2019s play park in a tiny village, where she came across a ride made out of four plastic swans. \u201cThat ride and everything about that little theme park was so sincere and so rinky-dink and just on the edge of depression,\u201d she says, smiling again. \u201cI revere that edge.\u201d Then she seems to remember my question and spells out her philosophy: \u201cToe the line, get on the swan ride, look at the blinky lights and be happy.\u201d \u2022 Kara Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall Commission is at Tate Modern, London, 2 October to 5 April.

Despite concerns from business about the cost of the proposal, McDonnell believes a 32-hour week is feasible without job losses.</p> \n<p>The pledge follows the recent publication of a <a href=\"https://progressiveeconomyforum.com/events/how-to-achieve-shorter-working-time-report-launch-with-lord-skidelsky/\">report by </a><a href=\"https://progressiveeconomyforum.com/events/how-to-achieve-shorter-working-time-report-launch-with-lord-skidelsky/\"> Robert Skidelsky</a>, which said the average working week for full-time workers was longer in the UK than in every EU country bar Greece and Austria.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/john-mcdonnell-shapes-labour-case-for-four-day-week\">John McDonnell shapes Labour case for four-day week</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI can tell you today that the next Labour government will put in place the changes needed to reduce average full-time working hours to 32 a week within the next decade,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cA shorter working week with no loss of pay.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shadow chancellor said that as a first step, a Labour government would end Britain\u2019s opt-out from the European working time directive.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs we roll out sectoral collective bargaining, we will include negotiations over working hours. We\u2019ll require working hours to be included in the legally binding sectoral agreements. This will allow unions and employees to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll set up a working time commission with the power to recommend to government on increasing statutory leave entitlements as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment.\u201d</p> \n<p>McDonnell said that due in large part to the efforts of trade unions, the average full-time working week had fallen from 65 hours in the 1860s to 43 hours in the 1970s.

      "bodyText": "Workers will enjoy longer holidays under a future Labour government as part of a 10-year plan to see the length of the average full-time working week drop by five hours, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has announced. Speaking at the party\u2019s conference in Brighton, McDonnell said he wanted to see a marked cut in the average working week from 37 to 32 hours within a decade, with no loss of pay. The shadow chancellor said Labour would adopt a two-pronged approach to reducing the working week: the creation of a working time commission with powers to increase statutory leave entitlement, coupled with stronger trade unions able to negotiate cuts in hours with employers. Labour has ruled out a French-style blanket cap on the working week, which it considers unworkable. Despite concerns from business about the cost of the proposal, McDonnell believes a 32-hour week is feasible without job losses. The pledge follows the recent publication of a report by Robert Skidelsky, which said the average working week for full-time workers was longer in the UK than in every EU country bar Greece and Austria. \u201cI can tell you today that the next Labour government will put in place the changes needed to reduce average full-time working hours to 32 a week within the next decade,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cA shorter working week with no loss of pay.\u201d The shadow chancellor said that as a first step, a Labour government would end Britain\u2019s opt-out from the European working time directive. \u201cAs we roll out sectoral collective bargaining, we will include negotiations over working hours. We\u2019ll require working hours to be included in the legally binding sectoral agreements. This will allow unions and employees to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll set up a working time commission with the power to recommend to government on increasing statutory leave entitlements as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment.\u201d McDonnell said that due in large part to the efforts of trade unions, the average full-time working week had fallen from 65 hours in the 1860s to 43 hours in the 1970s. But in recent decades the link between increasing productivity and shorter hours had been broken. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put that right,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cWe should work to live, not live to work.\u201d Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said he was pleased that Labour had ruled out a cap on hours, but added that the UK\u2019s productivity gap with rival countries could not be closed by simply reducing working hours. \u201cForcing a shorter working week on small firms is not feasible.

      "body": "<p>Hossam Ramzy, who has died at the age of 65 while undergoing treatment for a heart condition, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKzmJfK0NJM\" title=\"\">was Egypt\u2019s most successful percussionist</a>.</p> <p>A versatile and famously hard-working performer, arranger, composer and entrepreneur, he became the go-to player for a wide array of international musicians keen to introduce a North African or Middle Eastern edge to their music, working with everyone from jazz and North African musicians to rock stars, including Peter Gabriel, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page.</p> <p>He wrote and played on film soundtracks, released albums of Egyptian dance music and ran a dance school. He may not have been a household name, but his music was heard by millions.</p> <p>Born in the fashionable Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, he came from a successful family. His father, Abbas Ibrahim Hassan, was an entomologist, while his mother Omayma Ramzy was a fine pianist and player of <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-lute-and-an-oud\" title=\"\">the oud, the predecessor of the lute</a>. Hossam was given his first instrument \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/search/goblet+drum\" title=\"\">Egyptian tabla</a>, or goblet-shaped hand drum \u2013 at the age of three, and became fascinated by percussion. Encouraged by his mother, he learned to accompany her performances and went on to study western drum styles and the piano while at junior school.</p> <p>When he was a teenager his father moved to Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia, to work, and there Hossam studied with local composers and learned new rhythms from the Bedouin musicians he visited in the desert.</p> <p>Returning to Egypt in the early 1970s he worked as a drummer in the Cairo clubs. Despite the wishes of his father, who did not want him to become a musician, he moved to Britain in 1975, and began playing drums for such rising jazz players as the saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/16/andy-sheppard-quartet-surrounded-by-sea-review\" title=\"\">Andy Sheppard</a>. He also played with what was then the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra, ran his own jazz/funk group and worked as a cook (he was an excellent one) in London restaurants.</p> <p>In 1980 he dramatically changed his musical direction. A friend invited him to an Arabic club in London, where an Egyptian band were playing and he was reintroduced to the music he had heard as a child. It was, he said \u201ca night of transformation for me. I never thought that from Egyptian drums there could be such a marvellous sound.\u201d</p> <p>He went back to Cairo, bought tabla drums, and came back to London to start practising, using techniques he had learned as a jazz musician to develop his own style. Instead of using sticks and a drum kit, he was now drumming with his fingers on a clay pot with a fish skin head.</p> <p>Ramzy quickly established a new musical reputation, working in nightclubs and providing the backing for Egyptian and British dancers. He held workshops for dancers interested in Egyptian styles, and it was for this market that he recorded his first album, Introduction to Egyptian Dance Rhythms.</p> <p>The timing was perfect. The 80s saw the start of the so-called \u201cworld music\u201d scene. British audiences were taking a growing interest in global sounds and rhythms \u2013 and so too were British pop stars.</p> <p>Hossam\u2019s breakthrough came when Gabriel heard his album and invited him to play on his soundtrack for Martin Scorsese\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/10/the-last-temptation-of-christ-scorcese-30th-anniversary\" title=\"\">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>, which was released as a Peter Gabriel album, Passion, in 1989. It included such global celebrities as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/youssou-n-dour\" title=\"\">Youssou N\u2019Dour</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/16/nusrat-fateh-ali-khan-musstt-musstt\" title=\"\">Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan</a>, and Ramzy can be heard on five tracks, including the opening <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA1ysAt2PMQ\" title=\"\">The Feeling Begins</a>, playing tabla, finger cymbals and other percussion.</p> <p>In the same year he also appeared on Passion Sources, an album of music that inspired Gabriel\u2019s writing. He continued to work with Gabriel on a series of projects, including the album Us (1992).

      "bodyText": "Hossam Ramzy, who has died at the age of 65 while undergoing treatment for a heart condition, was Egypt\u2019s most successful percussionist. A versatile and famously hard-working performer, arranger, composer and entrepreneur, he became the go-to player for a wide array of international musicians keen to introduce a North African or Middle Eastern edge to their music, working with everyone from jazz and North African musicians to rock stars, including Peter Gabriel, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. He wrote and played on film soundtracks, released albums of Egyptian dance music and ran a dance school. He may not have been a household name, but his music was heard by millions. Born in the fashionable Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, he came from a successful family. His father, Abbas Ibrahim Hassan, was an entomologist, while his mother Omayma Ramzy was a fine pianist and player of the oud, the predecessor of the lute. Hossam was given his first instrument \u2013 an Egyptian tabla, or goblet-shaped hand drum \u2013 at the age of three, and became fascinated by percussion. Encouraged by his mother, he learned to accompany her performances and went on to study western drum styles and the piano while at junior school. When he was a teenager his father moved to Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia, to work, and there Hossam studied with local composers and learned new rhythms from the Bedouin musicians he visited in the desert. Returning to Egypt in the early 1970s he worked as a drummer in the Cairo clubs. Despite the wishes of his father, who did not want him to become a musician, he moved to Britain in 1975, and began playing drums for such rising jazz players as the saxophonist Andy Sheppard. He also played with what was then the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra, ran his own jazz/funk group and worked as a cook (he was an excellent one) in London restaurants. In 1980 he dramatically changed his musical direction. A friend invited him to an Arabic club in London, where an Egyptian band were playing and he was reintroduced to the music he had heard as a child. It was, he said \u201ca night of transformation for me. I never thought that from Egyptian drums there could be such a marvellous sound.\u201d He went back to Cairo, bought tabla drums, and came back to London to start practising, using techniques he had learned as a jazz musician to develop his own style. Instead of using sticks and a drum kit, he was now drumming with his fingers on a clay pot with a fish skin head. Ramzy quickly established a new musical reputation, working in nightclubs and providing the backing for Egyptian and British dancers. He held workshops for dancers interested in Egyptian styles, and it was for this market that he recorded his first album, Introduction to Egyptian Dance Rhythms. The timing was perfect. The 80s saw the start of the so-called \u201cworld music\u201d scene. British audiences were taking a growing interest in global sounds and rhythms \u2013 and so too were British pop stars. Hossam\u2019s breakthrough came when Gabriel heard his album and invited him to play on his soundtrack for Martin Scorsese\u2019s film The Last Temptation of Christ, which was released as a Peter Gabriel album, Passion, in 1989. It included such global celebrities as Youssou N\u2019Dour and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and Ramzy can be heard on five tracks, including the opening The Feeling Begins, playing tabla, finger cymbals and other percussion. In the same year he also appeared on Passion Sources, an album of music that inspired Gabriel\u2019s writing. He continued to work with Gabriel on a series of projects, including the album Us (1992). Gabriel described him as a \u201cgreat musician and good friend \u2026 a soulful percussionist who was a great champion for many musicians from his part of the world\u201d. Ramzy\u2019s second major breakthrough came in 1994 when he was invited by the Led Zeppelin stars Robert Plant and Jimmy Page to assemble a band of Arabian string players and percussionists to work on their live reunion album No Quarter \u2013 Unledded. It was a bestseller, certified triple platinum, and Ramzy went on to accompany them on their 1995-96 world tour. But he was not only interested in accompanying western stars. In September 1998 he was lead percussionist and director of the Egyptian orchestra flown in to accompany three major Algerian singers, Rachid Taha, Khaled and Faudel at the 1, 2, 3 Soleils concert at the Bercy stadium in Paris. The event led to a bestselling live double album, and was, according to Taha, the first concert of North African rai music to be given serious coverage in the French media. As a percussionist or arranger, Ramzy worked with an astonishing number of different musicians, from jazz players including Chick Corea to the Rolling Stones, Shakira, Natacha Atlas and Sting. His film soundtrack work ranged from Stargate to The Hunchback of Notre Dame. His own albums included the ambitious global fusion set Rock the Tabla (2011), which included guests from across the world including the Bollywood keyboard player and composer AR Rahman, and the veteran jazz-fusion drummer Billy Cobham. It was nominated for a Songlines award the following year. His final projects included percussion work for the American blues-rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa on his Live at Carnegie Hall acoustic album (released 2017) and for the Canadian composer and multi-instrumentalist Loreena McKennitt at the Albert Hall in London earlier this year. As a dance enthusiast, Hossam ran the Drumzy School of Music &amp; Dance in East Grinstead, West Sussex, teaching \u201cbelly dancing and Egyptian rhythm and music\u201d. He loved horses and was an excellent rider and semi-professional show jumper. Married three times, he was separated from his third wife, Serena. He is survived by his three children, Louvaine, Omayma and Amir. \u2022 Hossam Ramzy, percussionist, arranger and composer, born 15 December 1953; died 10 September 2019",

      "bodyText": "A dispute over delays to crown court trials has broken out after criminal barristers accused the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) of making false economies by not reducing case backlogs. Figures obtained by the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) show two of London\u2019s busiest crown courts, Snaresbrook and Isleworth, had almost 2,000 cases outstanding according to the latest figures. But HM Courts and Tribunals Service maintains that waiting times are at their shortest since 2014 and claims the number of outstanding cases has halved in the past four years. The row centres on the government\u2019s decision to reduce the number of sitting days it pays for recorders \u2013 part-time judges \u2013 to hear criminal trials at crown courts on the grounds that the number of cases coming to court has fallen. Earlier this month, Lady Justice Macur, the senior presiding judge in England and Wales, said maintaining the backlog of cases by not employing more recorders to hear waiting cases \u201cwas a political decision\u201d. A survey of crown courts by lawyers on Monday reported that 130 out of 453 available criminal courtrooms on Monday were not sitting.

Those returns sit in contrast with \u2013 but are possibly not unconnected to \u2013 his thundering performances as opener in England\u2019s World Cup-winning team.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Such is the sensitivity of the call and the cricketer concerned that Smith and his fellow selector, James Taylor, will now meet Bairstow in Leedson Wednesday, hoping they can convince a player who was previously so determined to keep wicket that he can instead convert himself into the batsman England would prefer.</p> \n<p>Smith said: \u201cI\u2019m using my words carefully.

He has a non-Test match first-class average of 50, which puts him alongside Joe Root. Only Ollie Pope [57] is above those two. There\u2019s a real opportunity to reset, work on a few things and focus on how he can become that top Test-match player.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor whatever reason, whether it\u2019s white-ball cricket, a busy schedule, keeping, I don\u2019t have an answer. But I do have an aspiration and that\u2019s that Jonny becomes a top batsman. I wouldn\u2019t want to narrow his options but I want an open conversation with him. The primary issue is getting the most out of him as a batsman.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019m using my words carefully.

Trevor Bayliss, the now departed head coach, felt No 3 was the right-hander\u2019s best spot but with a replacement yet to be sourced, the captain\u2019s personal vision has held sway.</p> \n<p>It is why England have opted for Sibley, the Warwickshire opener with 10 first-class hundreds in the past two years, and Crawley, the Kent right-hander picked more on style and potential, rather than choose between them. England also want Pope, notionally the reserve wicketkeeper for the second half of the tour with Ben Foakes placed on standby, to have an extended run at No 6 below Ben Stokes and above Buttler.

      "bodyText": "Jonny Bairstow has been challenged to fight his way back into England\u2019s Test side as a specialist batsman after he was dropped for the upcoming series in New Zealand with the wicketkeeping role handed to Jos Buttler. In response to the 2-2 Ashes draw with Australia, Ed Smith, the national selector, has plumped for a reboot when England play a two-match series in late November (one that follows five Twenty20 internationals and sits outside of the World Test Championship points system). The uncapped Dominic Sibley and Zak Crawley will challenge Rory Burns and Joe Denly for spots in the top three, while the Lancashire bowlers Matt Parkinson and Saqib Mahmood also earn their first call-ups to both squads. Surrey\u2019s precociously talented Ollie Pope gets a fresh Test chance after two fleeting appearances against India in 2018. But it is the decision to stand down Bairstow, just three days after renewing his Test central contract, that jumped off the page on Monday when Smith once again proved himself to be unafraid of shuffling the pack. The Yorkshireman boasts 69 caps but has made one half-century from 13 innings since regaining the gloves in February following a brief hiatus. Those returns sit in contrast with \u2013 but are possibly not unconnected to \u2013 his thundering performances as opener in England\u2019s World Cup-winning team. Such is the sensitivity of the call and the cricketer concerned that Smith and his fellow selector, James Taylor, will now meet Bairstow in Leedson Wednesday, hoping they can convince a player who was previously so determined to keep wicket that he can instead convert himself into the batsman England would prefer. Smith said: \u201cI\u2019m using my words carefully. Jonny hasn\u2019t been rested. That would be a cop out. However, I do see Jonny as being a top batsman, so I would say it\u2019s an opportunity to reset and come back. \u201cIf I had to give a prediction, it would be that he comes back stronger and has a very good Test career. He has a non-Test match first-class average of 50, which puts him alongside Joe Root. Only Ollie Pope [57] is above those two. There\u2019s a real opportunity to reset, work on a few things and focus on how he can become that top Test-match player. \u201cFor whatever reason, whether it\u2019s white-ball cricket, a busy schedule, keeping, I don\u2019t have an answer. But I do have an aspiration and that\u2019s that Jonny becomes a top batsman. I wouldn\u2019t want to narrow his options but I want an open conversation with him. The primary issue is getting the most out of him as a batsman.\u201d As well as diminishing returns and a growing propensity for being bowled, Bairstow\u2019s demotion is linked with Root\u2019s desire to return to No 4 come the first Test in Mount Maunganui on 21 November. Trevor Bayliss, the now departed head coach, felt No 3 was the right-hander\u2019s best spot but with a replacement yet to be sourced, the captain\u2019s personal vision has held sway. It is why England have opted for Sibley, the Warwickshire opener with 10 first-class hundreds in the past two years, and Crawley, the Kent right-hander picked more on style and potential, rather than choose between them. England also want Pope, notionally the reserve wicketkeeper for the second half of the tour with Ben Foakes placed on standby, to have an extended run at No 6 below Ben Stokes and above Buttler. The latter was first pick as selector last year, and a player now felt to be in need of a defined role beyond simply a lower-middle order wildcard. On Pope, who had shoulder surgery this summer, Smith said: \u201cHis numbers are outstanding but also his character \u2013 the way he came back in better shape is typical of him. We are excited about his future as we look to identify players with the DNA of a Test player.\u201d With Jimmy Anderson now eyeing a return for South Africa in December \u2013 he and the similarly injured Mark Wood will attend a fast bowling camp there at the start of the month \u2013 his county teammate Mahmood comes in to offer pace and skills with the older ball. Parkinson, another rising star from Lancashire, will support Jack Leach. The leg-spinner\u2019s big chance results from Moeen Ali\u2019s desire to take a break from Test contention, one that has surprisingly earned the all-rounder an extended breather; Smith cited Moeen as one of six players rested from the Twenty20 squad along with Jason Roy, who has lost his Test spot, Jofra Archer, Buttler, Root and Stokes. The World Twenty20 in Australia next October is a fresh priority for the white-ball side \u2013 Eoin Morgan will again captain after recommitting to the role \u2013 and England are keen to widen their pool of players in international cricket, allowing the more established players to further their experience in next year\u2019s Indian Premier League. Somerset\u2019s Tom Banton receives his first call-up as a result, following a blistering campaign in the T20 Blast, while fellow batsmen Sam Billings, James Vince and Dawid Malan all return. Pat Brown, the 21-year-old Worcestershire seamer with a deceptive knuckle ball, is another to benefit. Bairstow was also included but Smith said the decision on whether he or Billings keeps wicket will be made by Morgan and whoever is head coach. Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe, both in contention for the vacancy, sat in on selection.",

Wong urges caution on trade war Tuesday\u2019s speech in Chicago comes as Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, argues that Australia needs to be careful to do more than \u201cnavigate the slipstream\u201d as strategic competition between the US and China intensifies in the region. In a speech to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta on Tuesday, Wong says that she looks forward to seeing what benefits Morrison has secured from the Washington visit, \u201cparticularly how he has been able to shape the administration\u2019s thinking and language on the trade war\u201d. \u201cThe trade war, as currently conducted \u2026 undermines multilateralism and the rules-based trading system, including by reinforcing the idea that size and economic power determine the terms of engagement,\u201d a draft version of Wong\u2019s speech says. She says that while the US and China will continue to jockey for influence in the region, Australia needed to be more than just a \u201cspectator\u201d. \u201cGreat powers will do what great powers do \u2013 assert their interests. But the rest of us are not without our own agency,\u201d Wong says. \u201cWe are in fact faced with a choice \u2013 but it is not the US-China binary. \u201cThe choice is this: are we simply to be spectators to the consequences of this strategic competition in our region, or do we work proactively and collectively to shape rules, norms and standards in line with our interests and values?\u201d Wong criticises both Beijing and Washington for seeking to disrupt the status quo, saying the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, the Paris agreement on climate change, the UN Human Rights Council, and the Iran nuclear deal indicated a rejection of the \u201cnorms to which we have become accustomed\u201d. She also said some of the \u201cassertiveness\u201d from Beijing in seeking to shape the region in line with its preferences and ambitions was not \u201cconducive to the kind of region in which we want to live\u201d.",

A clever, captivating thriller which sparkles with wit, it follows the murderous exploits of Tom Ripley, as he audaciously commits violent crimes... Highsmith\u2019s genius is in making you side with Tom - he\u2019s charming, and as a reader it\u2019s hard not to fall under the spell of that. By making such a problematic character so personable , Highsmith forces the reader to examine why we want him to \u2018get away with it\u2019 - and we do. Catch Me If You Can with a murderous twist, this is a book I\u2019d heartily recommend. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f.25/5 . . #bookstagram #bibliophile #booklove #bookcommunity #bookreview #whattoread #thetalentedmrripley #patriciahighsmith #vintagebooks #vintageinthewild #bookcover #crimefiction #thriller #guardianbooks #sarahs89reads #sarahs89readsreviews</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarahs89reads/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Sarah</a> (@sarahs89reads) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-09-22T14:32:20+00:00\">Sep 22, 2019 at 7:32am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/sep/16/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s open with a bang, as <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful </a>recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It\u2019s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other\u2019s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning\u2026 Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.</p> </blockquote> <p>Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1280965\">Kincaid </a>to make a \u201cmajor shout-out for the British Library\u2019s crime series\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.</p> </blockquote> <p>My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100544865\">jimitron5000</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn\u2019t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.</p> </blockquote> <p>JG Farrell\u2019s Singapore Grip is \u201cmarvellous, as you would expect from this author,\u201d writes <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The main thing I\u2019ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it \u2013 though there obviously wasn\u2019t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America\u2019s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn\u2019t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn\u2019t quite as satisfying as <em>Troubles</em>, it\u2019s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4605584\">Pseudaletia </a>is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has \u2018taken\u2019. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I\u2019m not far enough into it to talk about it\u2019s meaning, etc, but so far it\u2019s entertaining and thoughtful.</p> </blockquote> <p>We Don\u2019t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2475818\">pubbore</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.</p> </blockquote> <p>Vasily Grossman\u2019s Stalingrad is \u201cvery long\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a>, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read <em>Life and Fate </em>) and various individuals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I\u2019m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1700934\">Vesca </a>has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not as dark than others of hers I\u2019ve read, which may be because it\u2019s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there\u2019s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who <em>is </em>Robinson?</p> </blockquote> <p>Now I want to know too.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Hey, hey, my, my, <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/09/17/books-wont-die/\">paper books will never die</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? <a href=\"http://www.crazyoik.co.uk/workshop/edmund_wilson_on_crime_fiction.htm\">Edmund Wilson\u2019s classic (and brutal) essay on crime fiction</a>.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Let\u2019s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin: Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It\u2019s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other\u2019s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning\u2026 Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre. Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a \u201cmajor shout-out for the British Library\u2019s crime series\u201d: Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when. My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000: There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn\u2019t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read. JG Farrell\u2019s Singapore Grip is \u201cmarvellous, as you would expect from this author,\u201d writes SydneyH: The main thing I\u2019ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it \u2013 though there obviously wasn\u2019t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America\u2019s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn\u2019t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn\u2019t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it\u2019s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished. Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass: \u2026 A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has \u2018taken\u2019. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I\u2019m not far enough into it to talk about it\u2019s meaning, etc, but so far it\u2019s entertaining and thoughtful. We Don\u2019t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore: A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful. Vasily Grossman\u2019s Stalingrad is \u201cvery long\u201d says paulburns, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d: It\u2019s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various individuals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I\u2019m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear. Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark: It\u2019s not as dark than others of hers I\u2019ve read, which may be because it\u2019s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there\u2019s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson? Now I want to know too. Interesting links about books and reading Hey, hey, my, my, paper books will never die. Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? Edmund Wilson\u2019s classic (and brutal) essay on crime fiction. (Hat tip to Swelter.) Also from the archives, Lawrence Durrell on The Art Of Fiction in the Paris Review. \u201cYou know, I was trying everything\u2026\u201d Book Marks list 10 novels that changed history. The longlist for National Book Award for Translated Literature. If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog. Happy reading!",

Unless Eddie Jones\u2019s England were deliberately holding back against Tonga, they also need to reflect on what did and did not work for them during their underwhelming opening fixture inside the Sapporo Dome on Sunday. Nullifying opponents defensively is all very well but against sides who tackle stoutly they need to vary their point of attack more widely, concede significantly fewer penalties and play slightly more with their heads up. As Wales demonstrated against Georgia it is never too early in any big tournament to execute precisely, handle surely and play deliberately to space, wherever it happens to be. Power, in short, will count for a lot at this World Cup \u2013 Scotland certainly need to rustle some up some more gainline presence from somewhere \u2013 but so will a certain flexibility of mindset. Only those squads who adjust rapidly to the unique challenges of this World Cup will prosper in the days and weeks ahead.",

The Stena Impero\u2019s Swedish owners are yet to confirm the vessel has been freed from the port city of Bandar Abbas, but had said on Sunday its release was imminent. The decision to release the vessel comes a day before a meeting between Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York. Analysts said the timing of the announcement could be aimed at generating some goodwill ahead of the international meeting in which the Islamic Republic is expected to face pressure over allegations it carried out or supported last week\u2019s missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure. Johnson was asked at the UN meeting on Monday about the attacks. \u201cHow do we respond to what the Iranians plainly did? What the UK is doing is trying to bring people together and de-escalate tensions,\u201d he told Sky. The Stena Impero was dramatically seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz after Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations. Footage released by Iran showed Revolutionary Guards descending from a helicopter to take control of the ship and detain its 23 crew members. About two weeks earlier, British Royal Marines seized an Iranian supertanker off the coast of Gibraltar carrying 2.1m barrels of crude oil that UK authorities alleged was to be sold to Syria in breach of EU sanctions against Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government. Iran has denied the Stena Impero\u2019s impoundment was a tit-for-tat move. The takeover, which led the UK to advise its ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz, was part of a wave of sabotage attacks and seizures of ships over the past six months in and around the narrow waterway through which more than a quarter of the world\u2019s oil supply passes. The US and Gulf states have blamed Iran for the incidents, including the alleged use of explosives against four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May, suspicious fires on two tankers in the same area in June and the attempted seizure of a British vessel in July, allegedly by Iranian boats that were driven off by a Royal Navy warship. A Gibraltar court ordered the release of the Iranian vessel, then called Grace and since renamed Adrian Darya 1, on 18 August after receiving written assurances from Iran that it would not head to countries under EU sanctions. The Adrian Darya switched off its transported near the Syrian coast earlier this month. Satellite imagery of the ship analysed by the independent service TankerTrackers showed the vessel near the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday, casting a thin shadow that suggested it could still be laden with oil. That would contradict assessments by the UK, which has said it believes the oil onboard the ship has been sold to Assad\u2019s regime, as well as claims by Iranian officials that Adrian Darya\u2019s cargo was sold to a private company in a ship-to-ship transfer. The Islamic republic\u2019s oil exports have fallen from about 2m barrels per day in August 2018 to about 160,000 barrels a day after the US imposed sanctions in November. Washington is seeking to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement that Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out from in May last year. Trump said the deal, which traded curbs in Iran\u2019s nuclear programme for relief from sanctions, needed to also address Iranian missile development, human rights abuses and sponsorship of proxies.

The first such outing to be run for commercial purposes was a trip to Liverpool in 1845.</p>\n    <p>Over the next decade or so, the business expanded to offer overseas trips, to France, Switzerland, Italy and beyond, to the US, Egypt and India.</p>\n    <p>His more business-minded son John expanded the tour operator and its reach was such that the government enlisted its expertise in an effort, ultimately in vain, to relieve General Gordon at the siege of Khartoum in 1885.</p>\n    <p>John\u2019s three sons inherited the business, which incorporated as Thos Cook &amp; Son Ltd in 1924 and benefited from the increasing ease of international travel.</p>\n    <p>Its first flirtation with collapse came during the second world war, when the government requisitioned some of its assets and it was sold to Britain\u2019s railway companies, effectively a nationalisation.</p>\n    <p>But it boomed in the postwar years as growing prosperity fuelled the appetite for holidays and it returned to private ownership in 1972.</p>\n    <p>Since then, it has changed hands and changed shape via a series of mergers and takeovers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/27/thomas-cook-short-sellers\">It nearly collapsed in 2011</a> but averted its demise with a bailout deal funded by banks.</p>\n    <p>Now, after 178 years of operation, it has ceased trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Like many others, they had booked a package via a third-party operator just two weeks ago, which included flights with Thomas Cook.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe even have our boarding passes for our flight that is now not going to happen,\u201d Sheila said. \u201cWe were told to try and rebook.

He said: \u201cI know there had been things on the news [but] I\u2019d been on holiday the week before so I\u2019d not been following it that closely and I\u2019d not had a phone call or email.

I will now try to get another flight, I hope the insurance will cover it.\u201d John Bell and his family also approached the Thomas Cook desk to get information about their flight to Dalaman, Turkey for a two-week holiday, which puts their return flights outside the period in which passengers with booked plane tickets would be repatriated to the UK by the government. \u201cWe found out at 3.30am,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe used a credit card, so hopefully that\u2019ll give us some protection. Everything is getting booked up real fast now, so we don\u2019t know when or if we will be going.\u201d Bell said he thought Brexit could have had something to do with Thomas Cook\u2019s downfall. \u201cThen again, their troubles have been going on for years.\u201d Friends Judy and Sheila were scheduled to fly out for a week\u2019s holiday in Antalya, Turkey and found out about the collapse of the holiday firm when they arrived at Gatwick, where they were handed a Thomas Cook information letter. Like many others, they had booked a package via a third-party operator just two weeks ago, which included flights with Thomas Cook. \u201cWe even have our boarding passes for our flight that is now not going to happen,\u201d Sheila said. \u201cWe were told to try and rebook. Our travel operator said we should pay for new tickets and we would then get reimbursed, but I\u2019m sure any extras like transfers we\u2019ll have to pay for will leave us out of pocket.\u201d They were able to rebook tickets for a flight leaving before 10pm with another airline, for a \u201csmall fortune\u201d, and were told by their travel operator they would be refunded for the original cost of the Thomas Cook flights. \u201cI asked, \u2018What about the additional cost?\u2019 but they haven\u2019t said anything about that,\u201d Judy said. \u201cAll I want to do is lie down,\u201d Sheila added. By midday, there were only a handful of travellers still queueing at the Thomas Cook customer service desk at Gatwick. Stranded passengers booked to fly on cancelled Thomas Cook flights from Manchester airport complained of rising prices on other airlines. Apart from a few stranded passengers frantically trying to book other flights, the former Thomas Cook check-in desks at terminal one stood eerily empty of staff and queues, with the branding removed. Wedding planner Catalena Fernandes had been due to fly home to Canc\u00fan, Mexico on Monday morning. She had been travelling around the UK for two weeks and had two weddings scheduled for this week in Mexico. \u201cI was looking for information but my flight wasn\u2019t Atol protected so I cannot claim for a return flight. I can just ask for my money back, but flights [on other airlines] are very expensive right now. I don\u2019t know why my flight wasn\u2019t Atol protected. Like any normal person, I booked it, and thought it would be OK.\u201d She added: \u201cI am searching for other flights but I needed to be there today. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. It is a difficult situation.\u201d Kristina Terwilliger was in Manchester, supposedly in transit, but had been stranded for four hours. She had flown from Glasgow, with a flight booked to JFK airport in New York to visit family on Condor Airlines, a subsidiary owned by Thomas Cook. Last night the airline said it would continue operations, but Terwilliger arrived to find her flight cancelled. \u201cThey let me through and sent my bag to JFK, it was on the way and they had to get it back. I\u2019ve talked to Condor, there\u2019s no way to get through to Thomas Cook. There\u2019s nothing, no contact with Thomas Cook, no money back. \u201cIt\u2019s just that getting a flight out of here is just hard in general and prices are just going up and up. Everyone is trying to get out of here.\u201d Sidney Matias was trying to get home to Orlando after a holiday in the UK. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve had no information. I bought an extra bag yesterday, which they charged me for, so I woke up this morning and I came to the airport. I didn\u2019t know they were going to be cancelled. The only information is these guys gave me a piece of paper so I\u2019m going to have to buy another flight.\u201d Jerome Sinclair, who works for the fashion brand Burberry, was also booked to fly to New York on Condor, for work. He said: \u201cI know there had been things on the news [but] I\u2019d been on holiday the week before so I\u2019d not been following it that closely and I\u2019d not had a phone call or email. My flight was Condor so I was just hoping it would still be running. \u201cWhen I arrived at security, my boarding card flashed up to seek assistance. So now I\u2019ve got to try to get to New York today from somewhere but the train station is closed.\u201d",

[\u2026] Employers would definitely think about waiting for six more months, so they can hire other students who have the two year post-study work visa\u201d .</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to current international students about their concerns:</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s impossible for international students to get jobs at the moment\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Umair Qamar, from Pakistan, </em><em>recently graduated from De Montfort University with a master\u2019s in cyber security. He wants to find a job before his visa runs out.</em></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been applying for jobs since I came to this country. It\u2019s been a difficult and disappointing experience. I\u2019ve lost count of how many positions I\u2019ve applied for, but my CV is all over the UK. I\u2019ve had lots of rejections because the company didn\u2019t want to sponsor students. It\u2019s almost impossible for international students to get jobs at the moment. But I\u2019m still trying.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to hear other students will get the two year visa. But I want to point out that it would benefit the government to extend the deadline for current students, too. We are very dedicated and work hard.

It\u2019s all so confusing. Some reports say students graduating in 2020 will get the extension, but others say you have to graduate in 2021, so I don\u2019t know who will be affected. This makes me feel nervous about my future. If the UK government has decided to let international students stay longer, why wait a couple of years to implement it?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I worry current students could be worse off\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Hassan Sheikh did an undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester and is due to begin a master\u2019s this year.</em></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been told the extension applies to students graduating in 2021 and after and it\u2019s unclear whether it will apply to those graduating in 2020. If it doesn\u2019t apply to those of us graduating then, I worry employers will wait a year to hire international students so they don\u2019t need to deal with the hassle of sponsoring visas. In that sense I think current students like me could now be worse off than before the announcement was made. Because it just puts us in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cb44910c9b8174ee5b7548bf92b0183df74fa27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cb44910c9b8174ee5b7548bf92b0183df74fa27/0_1427_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Martins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Martins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Martins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I wish I\u2019d delayed coming to the UK, so I\u2019d have two years too\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Jessica Martins, from Brazil, has just handed in her dissertation for her master\u2019s in corporate communications, marketing and public relations at the University of Leeds. Her visa is due to run out in January.</em></p> <p>\u201cI think the extension should also be available for people who are currently here. I\u2019m happy new students will have the opportunity to stay longer. But it\u2019s also frustrating for me, because I would have liked to stay too. I don\u2019t regret coming to the UK, but I spent a lot of money and I\u2019m not sure whether my degree will help me to get jobs back home if I don\u2019t have work experience. If I\u2019d known this would happen, I would have waited two more years to come to the UK.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I was forced to leave the UK and it was the worst day of my life\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Laura*, from the US, graduated from King\u2019s College, London with a master\u2019s in European politics in 2018. She was forced to leave the UK four months later after being unable to find work before the deadline.</em></p> <p>\u201cLeaving the UK was the worst day of my life. I ended up on the floor of Gatwick, sobbing. I couldn\u2019t stand up because I was crying so hard. I had made a home, I had a boyfriend, I had a social circle, then I had to leave. When I got back to America, I was depressed and suicidal.</p> <p>\u201cBoth my degrees focused on UK/EU relations and I got a distinction for my dissertation, which was on Brexit. I feel my qualifications could be useful to British employers as the country prepares to leave the EU.

      "bodyText": "International students at British universities fear the government\u2019s plan to offer two-year post-study work visas to future students could leave them worse off if the extra time is not given to them too. Last week the government said foreign students will be offered a two-year work visa after graduating from a British university. But the new policy will only apply to those graduating from summer 2021, according to the announcement. The current immigration policy, controversially put in place by Theresa May in 2012, gives students just four months to find work after graduating. Over 16,000 people have already signed a petition calling on the government to extend the new visa rules to international students currently studying in the UK. The petition states: \u201cThere are thousands of international students currently studying in the UK and gaining valuable skills. \u201cSince the current students do not have the post-study work visa for two years and [need] sponsorship from an employer, it will be difficult for them to get a job. [\u2026] Employers would definitely think about waiting for six more months, so they can hire other students who have the two year post-study work visa\u201d . The Guardian spoke to current international students about their concerns: \u2018It\u2019s impossible for international students to get jobs at the moment\u2019 Umair Qamar, from Pakistan, recently graduated from De Montfort University with a master\u2019s in cyber security. He wants to find a job before his visa runs out. \u201cI\u2019ve been applying for jobs since I came to this country. It\u2019s been a difficult and disappointing experience. I\u2019ve lost count of how many positions I\u2019ve applied for, but my CV is all over the UK. I\u2019ve had lots of rejections because the company didn\u2019t want to sponsor students. It\u2019s almost impossible for international students to get jobs at the moment. But I\u2019m still trying. \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear other students will get the two year visa. But I want to point out that it would benefit the government to extend the deadline for current students, too. We are very dedicated and work hard. The recent change means there is hope.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m confused about who is eligible for the extension\u2019 Muhammad Junaid Asif Sahi, from Pakistan, is doing a master\u2019s in transport planning and engineering at Edinburgh Napier University. \u201cThe current four-month bracket for students is a mere formality and a bureaucratic way of saying, \u2018get the degree and go back home\u2019, because companies want someone they can hire without hassle. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay in the UK but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to. It\u2019s all so confusing. Some reports say students graduating in 2020 will get the extension, but others say you have to graduate in 2021, so I don\u2019t know who will be affected. This makes me feel nervous about my future. If the UK government has decided to let international students stay longer, why wait a couple of years to implement it?\u201d \u2018I worry current students could be worse off\u2019 Hassan Sheikh did an undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester and is due to begin a master\u2019s this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told the extension applies to students graduating in 2021 and after and it\u2019s unclear whether it will apply to those graduating in 2020. If it doesn\u2019t apply to those of us graduating then, I worry employers will wait a year to hire international students so they don\u2019t need to deal with the hassle of sponsoring visas. In that sense I think current students like me could now be worse off than before the announcement was made. Because it just puts us in the middle of nowhere.\u201d \u2018I wish I\u2019d delayed coming to the UK, so I\u2019d have two years too\u2019 Jessica Martins, from Brazil, has just handed in her dissertation for her master\u2019s in corporate communications, marketing and public relations at the University of Leeds. Her visa is due to run out in January. \u201cI think the extension should also be available for people who are currently here. I\u2019m happy new students will have the opportunity to stay longer. But it\u2019s also frustrating for me, because I would have liked to stay too. I don\u2019t regret coming to the UK, but I spent a lot of money and I\u2019m not sure whether my degree will help me to get jobs back home if I don\u2019t have work experience. If I\u2019d known this would happen, I would have waited two more years to come to the UK.\u201d \u2018I was forced to leave the UK and it was the worst day of my life\u2019 Laura*, from the US, graduated from King\u2019s College, London with a master\u2019s in European politics in 2018. She was forced to leave the UK four months later after being unable to find work before the deadline. \u201cLeaving the UK was the worst day of my life. I ended up on the floor of Gatwick, sobbing. I couldn\u2019t stand up because I was crying so hard. I had made a home, I had a boyfriend, I had a social circle, then I had to leave. When I got back to America, I was depressed and suicidal. \u201cBoth my degrees focused on UK/EU relations and I got a distinction for my dissertation, which was on Brexit. I feel my qualifications could be useful to British employers as the country prepares to leave the EU. But I sent over 100 applications and companies told me it was too risky to hire foreigners. \u201cAs angry as I am, I want to go back to the UK because I\u2019m now in professional limbo. The hostile environment has to end some time and this is a welcome first step. When I heard the announcement it was the first time in my life that I cried from happiness. For the first time I feel there\u2019s a chance I could get my life back again.\u201d \u2018The extension is a good first step, but there are other challenges\u2019 Riddi Viswanathan, from India, is a former international student and International Student Officer at the University of Manchester and now works for the university. \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting for this extension for five years, so I\u2019m delighted to hear the government has made a U-turn. The current four months isn\u2019t long enough and puts enormous pressure on people. I\u2019ve seen students struggle, staying up all night to do their dissertation just so they can apply for jobs during the day. I graduated a year ago and many companies rejected me because they didn\u2019t want to sponsor my tier two visa.

And so extending the post-study work visa is one good step, but it\u2019s not the end for international students.\u201d * Laura\u2019s surname has been omitted at her request.",

That is a far cry from the optimism displayed when tickets went on sale, with organisers promising that there had been \u201cregistrations of interest from literally all corners of the world\u201d. An IAAF spokesperson accepted ticket sales had been \u201cchallenging\u201d but said nobody could have foreseen the boycott of Qatar by other gulf states, making it impossible for some fans in the region to watch the championships. When asked about the possibility of tickets being given away, the spokesperson added: \u201cSurely it is a good thing that communities across Qatar will be getting tickets? We believe it will inspire a whole new generation of fans into the sport.\u201d More than 1,800 athletes from around 150 countries are expected to take part in the world championships, which will be held in the Middle East for the first time. However, Doha is not one of the traditional hotbeds of the sport and the event takes place at a time of year when the season is usually over. Nonetheless, the IAAF president, Seb Coe, has insisted that the championships will help track and field expand into new territories. Organisers have promised a raft of innovations for the event, including two miniature cameras in each starting block that will show the first pictures of athletes\u2019 faces in the 100m moments before they hear the starting pistol, and capture the explosion of energy as the athletes leave the blocks.",

Aaron Cresswell, having skimmed the bar with a similar effort a few minutes earlier, stepped up to curl the free kick inside the right-hand post.

The health ministry found at least 500 people died of heart valve trouble in France because of exposure to Mediator\u2019s active ingredient, but other estimates by doctors put the figure closer to 2,000. Thousands more live with debilitating health problems. Some women, who began taking the drug while in good health, found themselves unable to climb a flight of stairs and were left with permanent cardiovascular problems that limited their daily lives. Servier has paid out almost \u20ac132m (\u00a3116m) in compensation. The trial will seek to establish why the drug was on the market for so long in France. Lawyers argue that Servier laboratory deliberately misled patients for decades, helped by lenient authorities. The drugmaker has been accused of making at least \u20ac1bn from the drug, while knowing of its dangers. The French drug regulator, the Agence National de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament, is on trial accused of not taking sufficient steps to check and control the drug. It has been accused of being too slow to act and being too close to pharmaceutical companies. The watchdog has said it would cooperate with the trial and was now abiding by stricter ethics rules. The alarm was raised in 2007 when Ir\u00e8ne Frachon, a lung specialist from a Brittany hospital, assessed patients\u2019 records and warned of a link between Mediator and serious heart and pulmonary damage. \u201cThe trial comes as huge relief. Finally, we are to see the end of an intolerable scandal,\u201d Frachon said this week. \u201cThis so-called medicine is in reality a poison. The drug was not withdrawn from the market in France until 2009, two years after Frachon raised the alarm and many more years after it had been pulled in Spain and Italy. It was never authorised in the UK or US. In the 677-page French indictment, magistrates wrote that Servier \u201cknowingly concealed the medication\u2019s true characteristics\u201d from the 1970s and hid medical studies unfavourable to the product, perpetrating a long-term fraud. The scandal has raged for more than a decade, sparking a political row about drugs regulation and the lobbying power of pharmaceutical companies in France, which has one of Europe\u2019s highest levels of consumption of prescription drugs. The vast trial, with 21 defendants and more than 2,600 plaintiffs, will last six months and is set to be one of the longest court cases in Paris for decades. It has been likened in its time frame to the 1997 trial of the former police chief, Maurice Papon, convicted for his role in sending 1,700 Jews to Nazi death camps between 1942 and 1944. It has taken more than 10 years for the case to come to court. \u201cThe fact that a trial is ultimately taking place is, in itself, a victory for the victims,\u201d said Charles Joseph-Oudin, a lawyer for 250 plaintiffs. Servier has said it did not lie about the effects of the treatment and hoped to demonstrate it did not act against patients\u2019 interests.",

And then, straight away, you\u2019re thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to mark Harry Kane.\u2019 That was one of the first things that went through my head.\u201d</p> <p>It is unclear whether Prosser will face Kane at Colchester on Tuesnight as Mauricio Pochettino considers whether to rest the striker. But that is a detail in a much broader story. Ever since he left Spurs as a 16-year-old in 2004, having been overlooked for a YTS contract, Prosser has dreamed of getting on the pitch in a competitive game against them. At the age of 31 and as he closes in on 300 appearances for Football League clubs, it is finally on.</p> <p>Prosser\u2019s Spurs\u2019 credentials are impeccable. His father, Kevin, took him to his first game at White Hart Lane as an eight-year-old \u2013 a Boxing Day win over Southampton \u2013 and he can even count Cliff Jones, the legendary Welsh winger from the club\u2019s 1961 Double-winning team, as a family friend. Prosser grew up in Hertfordshire \u2013 two minutes from Jones\u2019s house \u2013 and was close to Jones\u2019s grandson Scott.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Cliff all my life \u2013 he\u2019s one of the nicest blokes,\u201d Prosser says. \u201cHe met me in the tunnel at White Hart Lane before the Port Vale cup tie and we had a picture. He also wrote me a letter to say how proud he was, which he left in my place in the dressing room. I used to do Cliff\u2019s soccer schools and I was best friends with Scott, growing up. Scott and his mum, Mandy, lived with Cliff.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to love going into Cliff\u2019s trophy room at the house. We were just in awe, although as a young kid you don\u2019t realise the full extent of what he achieved. When you\u2019re with other people, they say \u2018the Wales legend\u2019 and compare him to Gareth Bale. And you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Really? Cliff?!\u2019 He\u2019s 84 and is in unbelievable shape but he always has been. On his soccer schools, he\u2019d join in and take everyone on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4b75a59c2b679cbf205f88cbee722c020eab6d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4b75a59c2b679cbf205f88cbee722c020eab6d6/0_97_3426_2056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Prosser celebrates after Colchester\u2019s win at Oldham in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Prosser celebrates after Colchester\u2019s win at Oldham in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Blaxall/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prosser\u2019s face lights with enthusiasm as he talks about Spurs. He remembers how he was taken to watch the first-team train, as part of his attendance at Jones\u2019s soccer school, and being thrilled to get David Ginola\u2019s autograph, although that paled when set against playing at White Hart Lane while on the club\u2019s books. He still watches the team on TV as a fan and was distraught when they lost the Champions League final.</p> <p>Prosser was taken on when he was 10, having been scouted as he played at a soccer school run by Micky Hazard, another fomer Spurs favourite. \u201cGary Hooper, who went on to play for Celtic, was in my year and he was the one who you\u2019d probably say has come out best, although he left when he was 14,\u201d Prosser says. \u201cHe worked his way up through non-league at Grays. Jake Livermore was in the year below and Jamie O\u2019Hara was in the year above. Charlie Sheringham was also in my year and his dad, Teddy, would always be at training so everyone would be buzzing at that.</p> <p>\u201cGenerally, everyone at my school would have supported Spurs so to play for them as a young kid was a fantastic feeling.\u201d</p> <p>As with virtually every professional footballer, Prosser saw youth players who were better than him and, in his opinion, would surely go on to make the grade. They did not. Perhaps, it was because of their attitude, their unwillingness to make the sacrifices that were necessary.</p> <p>Prosser was never going to fall down on that front. He came to see the writing on the wall at Spurs when he did not \u201cplay up\u201d for the under-17s and the rejection, while devastating, was grimly expected. But he got a deal at Port Vale almost immediately and he has built his career upon a remorseless work ethic, a determination to wring every last drop from his talent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is an old-school edge to him, possibly because of his Port Vale apprenticeship, when he lived in digs with 10 other boys and, in his words, cleaned everything from senior players\u2019 boots and the manager\u2019s car to the whole stadium. There is a humility, too, which is evident when he talks about his younger sister, Abbie, who was a star of the women\u2019s youth game. She was a part of the England Under-19 squad that won the European Championship in 2009 and finished as the runners-up in 2010.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny when the chauffeur pulls up and your sister gets in and goes off with England and I\u2019m sitting there thinking: \u2018Bloody hell, I\u2019m at Port Vale here, where\u2019s my life going?\u2019\u201d Prosser says, with a smile. \u201cAbbie had a trial at Arsenal Ladies when she was little \u2013 she turned up in her Spurs kit \u2013 and she was signed within five minutes. But she ended up falling out of love with playing.\u201d</p> <p>Prosser can draw on the experience of having faced Spurs in pre-season during his time at Southend, when it did not go well. They lost 6-0 at Roots Hall in 2012 and 4-0 at the Tottenham training centre in 2015. \u201cKane scored a hat-trick in the first game,\u201d Prosser says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was my hardest game ever, like I was frightened to mark him, but he\u2019s still come off with the match ball. They had Danny Rose, Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend, while in 2015, it was Roberto Soldado, Rose and Townsend again, Nabil Bentaleb.\u201d</p> <p>Prosser is under no illusions as to the size of the challenge. Is there a script written for him?</p>",

His father, Kevin, took him to his first game at White Hart Lane as an eight-year-old \u2013 a Boxing Day win over Southampton \u2013 and he can even count Cliff Jones, the legendary Welsh winger from the club\u2019s 1961 Double-winning team, as a family friend. Prosser grew up in Hertfordshire \u2013 two minutes from Jones\u2019s house \u2013 and was close to Jones\u2019s grandson Scott. \u201cI\u2019ve known Cliff all my life \u2013 he\u2019s one of the nicest blokes,\u201d Prosser says. \u201cHe met me in the tunnel at White Hart Lane before the Port Vale cup tie and we had a picture. He also wrote me a letter to say how proud he was, which he left in my place in the dressing room. I used to do Cliff\u2019s soccer schools and I was best friends with Scott, growing up. Scott and his mum, Mandy, lived with Cliff. \u201cWe used to love going into Cliff\u2019s trophy room at the house. We were just in awe, although as a young kid you don\u2019t realise the full extent of what he achieved. When you\u2019re with other people, they say \u2018the Wales legend\u2019 and compare him to Gareth Bale. And you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Really? Cliff?!\u2019 He\u2019s 84 and is in unbelievable shape but he always has been. On his soccer schools, he\u2019d join in and take everyone on.\u201d Prosser\u2019s face lights with enthusiasm as he talks about Spurs. He remembers how he was taken to watch the first-team train, as part of his attendance at Jones\u2019s soccer school, and being thrilled to get David Ginola\u2019s autograph, although that paled when set against playing at White Hart Lane while on the club\u2019s books. He still watches the team on TV as a fan and was distraught when they lost the Champions League final. Prosser was taken on when he was 10, having been scouted as he played at a soccer school run by Micky Hazard, another fomer Spurs favourite. \u201cGary Hooper, who went on to play for Celtic, was in my year and he was the one who you\u2019d probably say has come out best, although he left when he was 14,\u201d Prosser says. \u201cHe worked his way up through non-league at Grays. Jake Livermore was in the year below and Jamie O\u2019Hara was in the year above. Charlie Sheringham was also in my year and his dad, Teddy, would always be at training so everyone would be buzzing at that. \u201cGenerally, everyone at my school would have supported Spurs so to play for them as a young kid was a fantastic feeling.\u201d As with virtually every professional footballer, Prosser saw youth players who were better than him and, in his opinion, would surely go on to make the grade. They did not. Perhaps, it was because of their attitude, their unwillingness to make the sacrifices that were necessary. Prosser was never going to fall down on that front. He came to see the writing on the wall at Spurs when he did not \u201cplay up\u201d for the under-17s and the rejection, while devastating, was grimly expected. But he got a deal at Port Vale almost immediately and he has built his career upon a remorseless work ethic, a determination to wring every last drop from his talent. There is an old-school edge to him, possibly because of his Port Vale apprenticeship, when he lived in digs with 10 other boys and, in his words, cleaned everything from senior players\u2019 boots and the manager\u2019s car to the whole stadium. There is a humility, too, which is evident when he talks about his younger sister, Abbie, who was a star of the women\u2019s youth game. She was a part of the England Under-19 squad that won the European Championship in 2009 and finished as the runners-up in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s funny when the chauffeur pulls up and your sister gets in and goes off with England and I\u2019m sitting there thinking: \u2018Bloody hell, I\u2019m at Port Vale here, where\u2019s my life going?\u2019\u201d Prosser says, with a smile. \u201cAbbie had a trial at Arsenal Ladies when she was little \u2013 she turned up in her Spurs kit \u2013 and she was signed within five minutes. But she ended up falling out of love with playing.\u201d Prosser can draw on the experience of having faced Spurs in pre-season during his time at Southend, when it did not go well. They lost 6-0 at Roots Hall in 2012 and 4-0 at the Tottenham training centre in 2015. \u201cKane scored a hat-trick in the first game,\u201d Prosser says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was my hardest game ever, like I was frightened to mark him, but he\u2019s still come off with the match ball. They had Danny Rose, Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend, while in 2015, it was Roberto Soldado, Rose and Townsend again, Nabil Bentaleb.\u201d Prosser is under no illusions as to the size of the challenge. Is there a script written for him?",

Julian became a full time musician in the late 80s \u2013 before then he had worked as a loss adjuster in the insurance industry. I came to know Julian and his family through the blues scene. His enthusiasm and generosity made him an immensely popular figure throughout the international blues community and his love of making music has been taken up by his children \u2013 his daughter, Lucy, is one of the UK\u2019s leading blues drummers. He is survived by his second wife, Catherine (nee Hayman), a teacher, whom he married in 1987, and their children, Lucy and Sam. His son, Jonathan, from his first marriage, to Claire de la Bertauche, which ended in divorce, died in 2012.",

      "body": "<p>Ed Miliband has said Labour needs a \u201cwartime\u201d mobilisation on the climate emergency in the next decade as he warned the party not to splinter over fixed decarbonisation targets.</p> \n<p>The former secretary of state for energy and climate change praised Labour activists for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/22/labour-members-launch-green-new-deal-inspired-by-us-activists\">Green New Deal campaign</a> which demands Labour commit to a net zero carbon date of 2030. The Tories have pledged to do so by 2050, and Liberal Democrats by 2045.</p> \n<p>However divisions emerged at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Brighton this weekend over whether Labour should be committed to a date or not. The GMB union hit back at the Labour for a Green New Deal motion committing the party to a 2030 target, and instead brought forward their own motion without an end date, a move due to concerns about energy sector jobs.</p> \n<p>Both motions will be voted on by delegates on Tuesday after a record 10-hour compositing meeting held on Sunday decided it was not possible to reach a compromise.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The year] 2050 isn\u2019t the radical position and now it\u2019s seen as a conservative \u2018small c\u2019 position. Look, in the end whether it\u2019s 2040, 30 or 50 we\u2019ve got to have the next 10 years, and in the first five years of a Labour government an absolute wartime mobilisation. Now everybody agrees about that,\u201d Miliband said during an event held by alternative festival The World Transformed, run by Momentum.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/27/corbyn-declares-national-climate-emergency\">Corbyn launches bid to declare a national climate emergency</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOne of Labour\u2019s best kept secrets is that on domestic policy we are incredibly united. There is a desire for radicalism across the Labour party. Across people who would be considered on the so called right of the party. So let\u2019s not pick fights.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have the compositing and all that and push as hard as you can but we\u2019re the only party that can deliver on this and we want to deliver in the next 10 years, whatever it says on the conference resolution.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Labour for a Green New Deal is a movement to transform industry in the future to ensure it tackles climate change, while creating investment and new green jobs. The decarbonisation of the economy through legislation has been pushed hard in the US by Democrats, including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p> \n<p>Labour has backed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/23/labour-to-deter-investment-in-fossil-fuels-to-address-climate-crisis\">green </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/23/labour-to-deter-investment-in-fossil-fuels-to-address-climate-crisis\">industrial </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/23/labour-to-deter-investment-in-fossil-fuels-to-address-climate-crisis\">revolution programme</a>, led by shadow secretary for business, energy and industrial strategy, Rebecca Long-Bailey, with billion pound investment commitments, including a major shift to electric cars.</p> \n<p>However, the motion presented by the Green New Deal campaign, and which had the support of up to 100 CLPs and Momentum, goes further, by adding a fixed target date.</p> \n<p>Miliband said Labour should have a radical green agenda, and push further than the Green party. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s two ways this can go...it can either become an election issue or I\u2019m afraid it will be like guns in the US, which is you have a good movement that is doing stuff on it but it never feels like it breaks through into being an election issue. That\u2019s why Labour for a Green New Deal have done such an amazing job.</p> \n<p>\u201cJohn McDonnell I think will be the first green chancellor we\u2019ve ever had. Trust me on this we\u2019ve got to make it an economic and social justice issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Miliband lambasted education secretary Gavin Williamson for criticising school pupils who missed out on school on Friday to take part in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates\">global </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2019/sep/20/climate-strike-global-change-protest-sydney-melbourne-london-new-york-nyc-school-student-protest-greta-thunberg-rally-live-news-latest-updates\">climate change strikes</a>.</p> \n<p>To cheers of activists in Brighton, he said: \u201cBy the way, that absolute moron, Gavin Williamson, said kids were bunking off, but this is a government that is bunking off for five weeks by closing down parliament.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"67bc25af-d30a-4465-a1d8-320ae27b3588\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:<br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.&nbsp; <br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.<br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 A fifth of all farmland \u2013 15% of the UK \u2013 being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs.

Secondly this has got to be a working-class issue, not just a middle-class issue.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd our allies in the trade unions are incredibly important on this. I spoke to Paul Nowak [deputy general of the TUC]. He wants us to move forward as fast as we can but he\u2019s worried about his workers in the oil and gas industry ... that\u2019s what the just transition is all about.\u201d</p> \n<p>Alex Mcintyre, spokesperson for Labour for a Green New Deal, said: \u201cA Green New Deal needs an ambitious target for decarbonisation, or it is meaningless.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe understand and respect GMB\u2019s concerns around the livelihoods of energy workers, which is why our motion calls for a 2030 target only if it assures a just transition for workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur Green New Deal will be worker-led, creating millions of good, green jobs, building new green industries and empowering trade unions to fight for their rights. It\u2019s the wealthiest that will pay for our Green New Deal, not workers and not ordinary people.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband has said Labour needs a \u201cwartime\u201d mobilisation on the climate emergency in the next decade as he warned the party not to splinter over fixed decarbonisation targets. The former secretary of state for energy and climate change praised Labour activists for their Green New Deal campaign which demands Labour commit to a net zero carbon date of 2030. The Tories have pledged to do so by 2050, and Liberal Democrats by 2045. However divisions emerged at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Brighton this weekend over whether Labour should be committed to a date or not. The GMB union hit back at the Labour for a Green New Deal motion committing the party to a 2030 target, and instead brought forward their own motion without an end date, a move due to concerns about energy sector jobs. Both motions will be voted on by delegates on Tuesday after a record 10-hour compositing meeting held on Sunday decided it was not possible to reach a compromise. \u201c[The year] 2050 isn\u2019t the radical position and now it\u2019s seen as a conservative \u2018small c\u2019 position. Look, in the end whether it\u2019s 2040, 30 or 50 we\u2019ve got to have the next 10 years, and in the first five years of a Labour government an absolute wartime mobilisation. Now everybody agrees about that,\u201d Miliband said during an event held by alternative festival The World Transformed, run by Momentum. \u201cOne of Labour\u2019s best kept secrets is that on domestic policy we are incredibly united. There is a desire for radicalism across the Labour party. Across people who would be considered on the so called right of the party. So let\u2019s not pick fights. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have the compositing and all that and push as hard as you can but we\u2019re the only party that can deliver on this and we want to deliver in the next 10 years, whatever it says on the conference resolution.\u201d The Labour for a Green New Deal is a movement to transform industry in the future to ensure it tackles climate change, while creating investment and new green jobs. The decarbonisation of the economy through legislation has been pushed hard in the US by Democrats, including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Labour has backed a green industrial revolution programme, led by shadow secretary for business, energy and industrial strategy, Rebecca Long-Bailey, with billion pound investment commitments, including a major shift to electric cars. However, the motion presented by the Green New Deal campaign, and which had the support of up to 100 CLPs and Momentum, goes further, by adding a fixed target date. Miliband said Labour should have a radical green agenda, and push further than the Green party. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s two ways this can go...it can either become an election issue or I\u2019m afraid it will be like guns in the US, which is you have a good movement that is doing stuff on it but it never feels like it breaks through into being an election issue. That\u2019s why Labour for a Green New Deal have done such an amazing job. \u201cJohn McDonnell I think will be the first green chancellor we\u2019ve ever had. Trust me on this we\u2019ve got to make it an economic and social justice issue.\u201d Miliband lambasted education secretary Gavin Williamson for criticising school pupils who missed out on school on Friday to take part in global climate change strikes. To cheers of activists in Brighton, he said: \u201cBy the way, that absolute moron, Gavin Williamson, said kids were bunking off, but this is a government that is bunking off for five weeks by closing down parliament.\u201d Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s key vote on climate change motions, he warned again for the party to work with the unions, adding:\u201cFirstly, keep protesting, keep striking, keep marching, keep the pressure on. Secondly this has got to be a working-class issue, not just a middle-class issue. \u201cAnd our allies in the trade unions are incredibly important on this. I spoke to Paul Nowak [deputy general of the TUC]. He wants us to move forward as fast as we can but he\u2019s worried about his workers in the oil and gas industry ... that\u2019s what the just transition is all about.\u201d Alex Mcintyre, spokesperson for Labour for a Green New Deal, said: \u201cA Green New Deal needs an ambitious target for decarbonisation, or it is meaningless. \u201cWe understand and respect GMB\u2019s concerns around the livelihoods of energy workers, which is why our motion calls for a 2030 target only if it assures a just transition for workers. \u201cOur Green New Deal will be worker-led, creating millions of good, green jobs, building new green industries and empowering trade unions to fight for their rights. It\u2019s the wealthiest that will pay for our Green New Deal, not workers and not ordinary people.\u201d",

WHO warned that lack of information over the cases, including clinical data, possible contacts and potential laboratory tests performed for differential diagnosis of the patients had not been communicated, leaving it unable to assess the potential risk. The statement comes hard on the heels of similar remarks by the US health secretary, Alex Azar, last week amid mounting concern that Tanzania may be in breach of its international commitments to share critical data relating to global health security. Alarm was raised earlier this month when a woman, understood to be a doctoral candidate who sources say had been doing field research in Tanzania and Uganda, fell ill and died in Dar es Salaam. Although Tanzania has insisted that its own tests showed negative for the Ebola virus, international health organisations have raised the alarm about not being given access to samples. According to unconfirmed reports, the woman, in her mid-30s, had been conducting health research and had visited several health facilities in central Uganda before her death, after showing symptoms of a serious febrile illness. The patient, who died on 8 September, had not been to the Democratic Republic of the Congo or had contact with Ebola cases, leading international health monitoring organisations to initially rule out the Ebola virus. However, as several more reported cases emerged, including the initial patient\u2019s sister, Tanzania\u2019s response to the issue has prompted alarm about the country\u2019s willingness to share either its test results or allow secondary testing of samples. Azar voiced his own criticism during a visit to Uganda, telling reporters that he and others are \u201cvery concerned\u201d as he urged Tanzania\u2019s government to share laboratory results regarding the case. Under international health regulations Tanzania is obliged to cooperate with international health bodies \u201cto protect Tanzanians as well as all people in the region\u201d. In its statement, issued over the weekend, the WHO made clear its frustration about the lack of information sharing. \u201cOn 19 September 2019, through its regular event-based surveillance process, WHO was made aware of unofficial reports regarding a contact of the initially presumptive case of [Ebola disease virus] who was reported to be sick and hospitalised. \u201cHowever, to date, clinical data, results of the investigations, possible contacts and potential laboratory tests performed for differential diagnosis of those patients have not been communicated to WHO.

      "bodyText": "There is a scene in Sorry We Missed You, Ken Loach\u2019s new film about a parcel courier driven to the brink by his brutal gig economy job, when his wife finally loses patience with his ruthless depot controller and screams at him to give her disintegrating husband a break. \u201cIsn\u2019t that funny,\u201d whispered Ruth Lane as she watched the first UK public screening on Sunday night in Brighton. \u201cI went into the depot office and shouted at Don\u2019s manager, complaining that he didn\u2019t have time to eat. I said you are bloody killing him. You are working him so hard.\u201d Don Lane, a courier for DPD, which delivers for retailers including Next and Asos, was Ruth\u2019s husband who collapsed and died aged 53 in January 2018 after working through illness in the Christmas delivery rush. His story has partly inspired Loach\u2019s follow up to I, Daniel Blake, which goes on general release on 1 November, and now his widow was having the \u201csurreal\u201d experience of seeing her own life\u2019s tragic events played out on the big screen at the Brighton Odeon on the fringes of the Labour party conference. Don Lane had skipped several hospital appointments to treat his type 1 diabetes because he had been charged \u00a3150 by DPD when he missed deliveries to attend an appointment and feared further charges. He collapsed twice while working, including once at the wheel, and was ill and vomiting blood before he died but did not take time off. Ruth Lane is now mounting a legal challenge against the company, which made a \u00a3121m profit in 2017 and paid its top executive a salary close to \u00a31m. It is contesting her claims that he should have been treated as a worker with holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage, and that its decision to charge him for missing work to attend hospital was disability discrimination. The parallels between fact and fiction came thick and fast for Lane in a film that tackles the emotional and social impact of the shift of financial risk on to workers in the rapidly growing gig economy, which involves 4.7 million people in Britain doing jobs including delivering parcels, caring for sick and elderly people, or driving minicabs. As Loach\u2019s hero Ricky, a father of two in Newcastle, nodded off at the wheel or raced to deliver parcels in strict one-hour windows for the fictional company PDF (Parcels Delivered Fast), Lane sighed. \u201cDon got breached for being three minutes late on one of those,\u201d she said, as Ricky was rebuked again for missing a \u201cprecise\u201d. When the fictional Ricky insisted on doing his round despite being battered and bruised after a robbery from his van, which the depot boss \u2013 \u201cthe patron saint of nasty bastards\u201d \u2013 says will cost him over \u00a31,000, Lane wonders what her husband was going through in the days before he died. After the film, when the screenwriter Paul Laverty told the audience about Don\u2019s story, her eyes filled with tears. Lane found her husband collapsed in the living room of their cottage and she and their 23-year-old son, Jordon, went with him in an ambulance to hospital, but to no avail. \u201cI think we should remember there are much worse cases than Ricky\u2019s story,\u201d said Laverty. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d said Lane, who works at a Marks &amp; Spencer in Bournemouth. \u201cPeople at work say: \u2018What did you do at the weekend?\u2019 I\u2019ve gone to a screening of a film partly based on my husband\u2019s death.\u201d \u201cYou give Don a voice and it\u2019s blowing me away,\u201d she told Laverty, whose research partly followed the Guardian\u2019s reporting of the impact of the gig economy. \u201cIf he had had his treatment he would have been here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s out of respect,\u201d said Laverty. \u201cIt is something that shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Lane was not the only person with personal experience of the pernicious effects of companies\u2019 rising use of self-employed contractors. Max Dewhurst, a cycle courier and trade union activist in London, reflected that the film was \u201clike watching a documentary\u201d. \u201cI know families being torn apart and the impact it has on their children, people falling asleep at the wheel, people being beaten up for their parcels.\u201d The film\u2019s events are less catastrophic than Don Lane\u2019s story, depicting the impact of a business\u2019s remorseless quest for profit on a person\u2019s fragile family life and mental health. As Ruth Lane said, a film rendition of her husband\u2019s story might not seem believable; his death would perhaps come across melodramatic. It was a view echoed by Laverty. While the film tackles the emotional turmoil of gig economy work, it leaves hanging the question of what the ultimate consequences might be. \u201cThe isolation, the low wages, the so-called self-employment is not the system failing but the system working as it is intended to do,\u201d said Loach. \u201cThey [companies] need labour they can turn on and off like a tap.

      "bodyText": "Philip Glass, as unlikely as it may seem, had never composed a note for percussion ensemble before he received a commission from the Chicago-based Third Coast Percussion, tonight making their London debut. Perpetulum, premiered in 2018, serves up something unusual: a journey beyond the chord sequences and melodic loops that have become Glass\u2019s calling card. Instead, the piece unfolds as an essay in absurdist disjoints, with jazzman block chords rampaging over marimbas smashing into dislocating march rhythms and trembling tam-tam swells. True enough, Glass reverts to type as these different strands are pulled together at the end, but this is easily his freshest, most imaginative score for years. Perpetulum \u2013 and their own arrangement of music from Glass\u2019s Madeira River which opened \u2013 showcased not only the group\u2019s lithe rhythmic precision but also their ear for dynamic variation and timbral detail, which is more than can be said of Steve Reich\u2019s tired, drab Mallet Quartet.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Robert Englund, played Freddy</strong></h2> <p>Before I played Freddy Krueger, I was in a lot of best-friend roles. I needed something more distinctive \u2013 and thought this little indie film called A Nightmare on Elm Street might be it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-craven\">Wes Craven</a>, the director, looked preppy, wearing Ralph Lauren and chinos, but looks were deceiving as he had a visionary mind. Remember: he discovered both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp\">Johnny Depp</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sharon-stone\">Sharon Stone</a>. He used to tell me that Freddy was the \u201cbastard father of us all\u201d. The character was supposed to signify the loss of innocence, as teenagers turn into adults and become corrupted.</p> <p>My Freddy was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/nosferatu-the-vampyre-review\">Klaus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/nosferatu-the-vampyre-review\">Kinski\u2019s Nosferatu</a>, but also by all the monsters that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Chaney\">Lon Chaney </a>created. The way Freddy always stands with his legs far apart was something I stole from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/01/6\">James Cagney</a> \u2013 a pose that signifies sheer power. People wonder why Freddy has this strange posture with his right shoulder slouched, but it was because that claw was so heavy it weighed me down. But I liked the way it made me look like a cowboy drawing a gun.</p> <p>I knew Freddy\u2019s claw had to be its own character, an extension of evil, but I also wanted it to be mildly erotic. Some people said Freddy was a pervert and a paedophile. They criticised the way I licked my lips at the teenagers as I haunted them in their dreams. But that was forgetting that Freddy is invading people\u2019s dreams, a very private and intimate thing. If someone gets into your subconscious, it\u2019s like they\u2019re in your underwear drawer. Teenagers always think about sex, so Freddy was a natural extension of that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCVh4lBfW-c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dCVh4lBfW-c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>My favourite scene is when Freddy drags Tina across the ceiling. We shot some really nasty stuff: there was one particularly disturbing shot of me between her legs that we couldn\u2019t get past the censors. That scene, plus the one where Johnny Depp\u2019s character gets swallowed by me into the bed and his blood pours upwards, were filmed by bolting the kids\u2019 beds to the ceiling and filming upside down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For the part where Nancy\u2019s feet sink into the stairs the steps were mushroom soup. The set absolutely stank.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The makeup took three and a half hours each morning. It was uncomfortable, hot and itchy. I remember seeing some of the teenagers waltz on to the set one day, envying their youth and beauty. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d I thought. \u201cI need to channel this jealousy into Freddy.\u201d</p> <p>I played the character in eight films, so he\u2019s never really left me. Sometimes, I\u2019ll be stuck in traffic in LA and he just comes out. I\u2019ll do the Freddy voice and shout: \u201cGet out my way, motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019m glad he\u2019s become this iconic bogeyman, but the films were so much more than him. They\u2019re all about a strong girl surviving Freddy. She\u2019ll realise her inner strength and beat this symbol of patriarchy. Nancy in the first movie was basically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/13/ridley-scott-alien-ripley\">Alien\u2019s Ripley</a> for teenagers.</p> <h2><strong>Heather Langenkamp, played Nancy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fd236503a9da1fe6b35a2cb14ee4aa5acf09d57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd236503a9da1fe6b35a2cb14ee4aa5acf09d57/57_71_3104_1862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018To this day I find it scary to take a bath\u2019...

Heather Langenkamp as Nancy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New Line/The Elm Street Venture/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the tone of the script I read at the audition, I didn\u2019t know this was a horror movie. It seemed more like a John Hughes film, with all these mischievous teenagers. Boy, was I wrong!</p> <p>Wes wanted to tap into how teenagers live a double life. They project confidence but inside they are terrified \u2013 and they have all kinds of personal Freddys. I think he cast me because I really was Nancy. I studied hard in school, I was earnest and respected my parents and I had a nice boyfriend. He wanted me to bring that to Nancy so that her transition into someone who can defeat Freddy is even more powerful. I remember being terrified when I first saw Robert in his Freddy makeup, but he was like a big brother and taught me so much about movement.</p> <p>I loved all the dream sequences. The part where Nancy\u2019s feet sink into the stairs was based on a real nightmare people have. The steps were mushroom soup, as it was the same beige as the carpet. The set absolutely stank. The moment when Freddy puts his head through my bedroom wall was created with loads of Lycra from a DIY store \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a lot of money, so we had to be creative. The bath sequence was crazy, too. It was 8ft deep and, as I floated on the surface, the SFX guy was below me in a scuba suit. Wes would tap on the side when he wanted him to raise Freddy\u2019s claws between my legs. To this day, I find it scary to take a bath.</p>",

People wonder why Freddy has this strange posture with his right shoulder slouched, but it was because that claw was so heavy it weighed me down. But I liked the way it made me look like a cowboy drawing a gun. I knew Freddy\u2019s claw had to be its own character, an extension of evil, but I also wanted it to be mildly erotic. Some people said Freddy was a pervert and a paedophile. They criticised the way I licked my lips at the teenagers as I haunted them in their dreams. But that was forgetting that Freddy is invading people\u2019s dreams, a very private and intimate thing. If someone gets into your subconscious, it\u2019s like they\u2019re in your underwear drawer. Teenagers always think about sex, so Freddy was a natural extension of that. My favourite scene is when Freddy drags Tina across the ceiling. We shot some really nasty stuff: there was one particularly disturbing shot of me between her legs that we couldn\u2019t get past the censors. That scene, plus the one where Johnny Depp\u2019s character gets swallowed by me into the bed and his blood pours upwards, were filmed by bolting the kids\u2019 beds to the ceiling and filming upside down. The makeup took three and a half hours each morning. It was uncomfortable, hot and itchy. I remember seeing some of the teenagers waltz on to the set one day, envying their youth and beauty. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d I thought. \u201cI need to channel this jealousy into Freddy.\u201d I played the character in eight films, so he\u2019s never really left me. Sometimes, I\u2019ll be stuck in traffic in LA and he just comes out. I\u2019ll do the Freddy voice and shout: \u201cGet out my way, motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019m glad he\u2019s become this iconic bogeyman, but the films were so much more than him. They\u2019re all about a strong girl surviving Freddy. She\u2019ll realise her inner strength and beat this symbol of patriarchy. Nancy in the first movie was basically Alien\u2019s Ripley for teenagers. Heather Langenkamp, played Nancy From the tone of the script I read at the audition, I didn\u2019t know this was a horror movie. It seemed more like a John Hughes film, with all these mischievous teenagers. Boy, was I wrong! Wes wanted to tap into how teenagers live a double life. They project confidence but inside they are terrified \u2013 and they have all kinds of personal Freddys. I think he cast me because I really was Nancy. I studied hard in school, I was earnest and respected my parents and I had a nice boyfriend. He wanted me to bring that to Nancy so that her transition into someone who can defeat Freddy is even more powerful. I remember being terrified when I first saw Robert in his Freddy makeup, but he was like a big brother and taught me so much about movement. I loved all the dream sequences. The part where Nancy\u2019s feet sink into the stairs was based on a real nightmare people have. The steps were mushroom soup, as it was the same beige as the carpet. The set absolutely stank. The moment when Freddy puts his head through my bedroom wall was created with loads of Lycra from a DIY store \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a lot of money, so we had to be creative. The bath sequence was crazy, too. It was 8ft deep and, as I floated on the surface, the SFX guy was below me in a scuba suit. Wes would tap on the side when he wanted him to raise Freddy\u2019s claws between my legs. To this day, I find it scary to take a bath.",

      "bodyText": "Former federal environment minister Josh Frydenberg has defended setting up a departmental meeting for fellow minister Angus Taylor in March 2017 on laws to protect critically endangered native grasslands when he knew that Taylor had an interest in a company that was under investigation for breaching those very same laws. Frydenberg backed Taylor\u2019s version of events, namely that Taylor had told the then-environment minister about his personal interest and that of his family when he requested the meeting. \u201cI became aware when he asked me for a meeting,\u201d Frydenberg told Patricia Karvelas on ABC Radio National on Monday evening. \u201cHe was very upfront. And he said that there was a family company which was subject to a compliance issue. And that he had an indirect interest in that company. But he was seeking a meeting on the technical aspects of the listing and in those circumstances, as is appropriate, would there [not] be any discussion of the compliance issue.\u201d Asked whether the approach from Taylor \u201chad rung alarm bells\u201d, Frydenberg responded that the \u201ckey component was that the meeting itself was only about the technical aspects of the listing\u201d. Taylor had constituents who had been concerned about the listing of those grasslands as critically endangered and there had been confusion around compliance with that law, he said. \u201cSo it is only relevant and only appropriate that in relation to the technical aspects of that listing, which the officials made very clear, that this was about, that he had that briefing. You would expect him to be advocating on behalf of constituents,\u201d Frydenberg said. Guardian Australia has revealed that Taylor had sought briefings from Frydenberg\u2019s department the day after compliance officers met with officers of Jam Land Pty Ltd over an alleged contravention involving poisoning of native grasslands near Delegate in southern New South Wales in late 2016. One of the directors of Jam Land is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and Taylor himself has an interest in the parcel of land, via his family investment company. Officials have confirmed to the Senate that the only compliance action in relation to clearing of grasslands for agriculture at the time was the Jam Land case. Taylor said on the weekend that he had disclosed his interest in the Jam Land and the existence of the compliance action to Frydenberg and that by doing had met his ministerial responsibilities. Frydenberg has now confirmed Taylor\u2019s version of events. Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal the department was acutely sensitive to the issue of the compliance action when Taylor asked for a briefing, which took place about two weeks later in Taylor\u2019s office in Parliament house. Departmental officials and a compliance officer attended. No notes were taken, the department has said After the meeting someone in Frydenberg\u2019s office asked for advice about whether the grasslands listing could be changed, but they were advised that any such decision would need to be made public and would go against the recent scientific advice. Frydenberg insisted that his officials had told the Senate that it \u201cwas absolutely appropriate for Angus Taylor to do that [seek the briefing]\u201d and the Labor party was \u201chyperventilating over this issue\u201d. \u201cWe have seen from subsequent documents released under FOI and in testimony to parliamentary hearings by the Department of Environment officials, that at no stage was the compliance matter discussed. And the last thing I want to make very clear, Patricia, that the grasslands were elevated to critically endangered and they remain at the level\u201d Frydenberg said. But Labor\u2019s shadow environment minister, Terri Butler, said Taylor had failed in his obligations to properly disclose his interests in accordance with the parliamentary requirements and his obligations under the ministerial standards. \u201cIt\u2019s clear also from the revelations that we\u2019ve had this weekend in relation to this scandal, that both minister Taylor and treasurer Frydenberg have questions to answer,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWhy did minister Frydenberg have his ministerial office arrange a meeting for minister Taylor with environment department officials, including an explicit request for a compliance officer, to talk about how the grasslands could be delisted? \u201cWhy is it that under this government, if you\u2019ve got a mate who is a minister, you get access to the department that is presently investigating the property in which you have a direct and personal interest?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s rows over Brexit worsened on Monday, as a split emerged in Momentum over whether to back Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position and Unison said it would back the pro-remain motion instead. Before crucial votes on Labour\u2019s Brexit position at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Brighton, the leadership was desperately trying to shore up support for the policy of delaying a decision on how the party would campaign in a referendum until after an election. The party\u2019s largely pro-EU membership will vote first on whether to support Corbyn\u2019s position, then a more neutral motion expressing backing for Corbyn and finally a statement in favour of Labour having a clear position in favour of remaining in the EU. Pro-remain campaigners received a boost after Unison, one of the biggest unions, said it would be backing the motion in favour of campaigning to stay in the EU. But they believed it would be \u201ctight\u201d because of a huge effort by the party leadership and unions to get delegates to support Corbyn\u2019s position, which was endorsed by the national executive committee (NEC) on Sunday. Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, decided during a phone meeting on Monday morning to support the leadership and reject the remain motion. But the decision was not supported by Jon Lansman, the chair of Momentum and one of its co-founders, who said he was \u201ccompletely supportive of Jeremy\u2019s leadership but incredibly disappointed with the process by which the NEC statement on Brexit was produced \u2026 there was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership\u201d. \u201cOn one of the biggest issues of the day, this is a travesty. Across the membership there are many different views on Brexit, and on conference floor members should feel free to vote with their conscience,\u201d he added. It is understood the Labour leader\u2019s office had been working behind the scenes to put pressure on Momentum officers to back Corbyn\u2019s position and reject a clear remain stance. The vote, expected in the late afternoon or early evening on Monday, will pitch Corbyn, Momentum, and some of the biggest unions including Unite and the GMB, against much of the party\u2019s membership, shadow cabinet ministers such as Emily Thornberry, and Unison. Earlier, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, made clear he wanted to campaign to remain in any second referendum, but he attempted to play down the row on Monday by saying he was happy to delay a decision on how the party would campaign. \u201cI smiled when you used the language earlier of civil war and revolt but there isn\u2019t any war in the Labour party. It\u2019s about honest, democratic debate,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cPeople have high emotions on this because they feel it\u2019s important.

It isn\u2019t \u2013 what we\u2019re having is an honest debate.\u201d He did, however, differ from Corbyn in saying he believed that no future deal could be better than Britain staying in the European Union. McDonnell said he wanted Labour to continue to promise an EU renegotiation, followed by a second referendum, if it won the next election. McDonnell also described the decision of Andrew Fisher, a key policy aide to the leader, to quit his post as the result of \u201ca bad day at the office\u201d. Fisher, who masterminded the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto, said he no longer had faith that Labour would be successful.

Perhaps you remember <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/06_june/08/wordhunt.shtml\">the appeal made by the BBC and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2005</a>: then, the earliest use of \u201ccodswallop\u201d on the OED\u2019s books was from a 1963 edition of the Radio Times, and they hoped viewers might be able to provide something older.</p> <p>It seemed possible that there might be a <em>much</em> earlier use of the word, as one theory for its origin involves a 19th-century maker of fizzy drinks named Hiram Codd. Since \u201cwallop\u201d is a term for beer, the idea is that \u201cCodd\u2019s wallop\u201d is, to a lover of beer, about the worst drink you can imagine and then the term found its more general sense.</p> <p>Apart from its being a bit too cute, the main problem with the theory is \u2026 well, that the OED couldn\u2019t find it in print before 1963, three-quarters of a century after the death of Mr Codd. But then, a breakthrough! <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/20/piffle.shtml\">A viewer got in touch</a> with an earlier use. Sid James, to be precise, to Tony Hancock:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Tony</strong>. I was not. <br><strong>Sidney</strong>. Don\u2019t give me that old codswallop.

      "bodyText": "It was Philistine\u2019s puzzle that made the news, but we mustn\u2019t overlook other remarks from Guardian setters, such as Arachne\u2019s clue \u2026 17ac Briefly anointed barbarous Boris Johnson? (7) [ wordplay: anagram (\u201cbarbarous\u201d) of ANOINTED without final letter (\u201cbriefly\u201d) ] [ anagram of ANOINTE ] [ definition: what Boris Johnson is an example of (hence the question mark) ] \u2026 for ETONIAN and Picaroon\u2019s clue \u2026 9ac Leading Brexiteer Boris ending, unfortunately, ruling people (9,6) [ surname of leading Brexiteer + anagram (\u201cunfortunately\u201d) of BORISENDING ] [ GOVE + anagram of BORISENDING ] [ definition: ruling people ] \u2026 for GOVERNING BODIES in a prize puzzle for which the annotated solution is now available. And if you come to the crossword page in a poignant effort to escape all that, there\u2019s still a topical ring to this Times clue \u2026 8d Oval game unfortunately is last of the series (5) [ wordplay: letter with oval shame + anagram (\u201cunfortunately\u201d) of GAME ] [ O + anagram of GAME ] [ definition: last of the series ] \u2026 for OMEGA. But if you prefer a puzzle of pure abstraction, you might enjoy What3Clues, to which Peter Moore Fuller of this parish contributes. Here\u2019s an explanation and an example: Latter patter A Telegraph setter who I take to be Jeremy Mutch has a surface reading \u2013 which, in an ideal world, would be cartoonish and fanciful rather than purely descriptive \u2013 in a clue \u2026 13ac Fish eat mostly plastics at first, and rubbish (10) [ definition: type of fish + synonym for \u201ceat\u201d without final letter (\u201cmostly\u201d) + initial letter of PLASTICS (\u201cat first\u201d) ] [ COD + SWALLOW without final letter + P ] [ definition: rubbish ] \u2026 for CODSWALLOP. Perhaps you remember the appeal made by the BBC and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2005: then, the earliest use of \u201ccodswallop\u201d on the OED\u2019s books was from a 1963 edition of the Radio Times, and they hoped viewers might be able to provide something older. It seemed possible that there might be a much earlier use of the word, as one theory for its origin involves a 19th-century maker of fizzy drinks named Hiram Codd. Since \u201cwallop\u201d is a term for beer, the idea is that \u201cCodd\u2019s wallop\u201d is, to a lover of beer, about the worst drink you can imagine and then the term found its more general sense. Apart from its being a bit too cute, the main problem with the theory is \u2026 well, that the OED couldn\u2019t find it in print before 1963, three-quarters of a century after the death of Mr Codd. But then, a breakthrough! A viewer got in touch with an earlier use. Sid James, to be precise, to Tony Hancock: Tony. I was not. Sidney. Don\u2019t give me that old codswallop. You were counting your money. So, 1959. So much, again, for \u201cCodd\u2019s wallop\u201d. But I have exciting news, if you\u2019re a word fan, which you are. I have submitted to the dictionary this, from, it seems, 1951: Commenting on the competition results the Architectural Design said \u2018If you believe that the Christian Church has no function in our society then a cathedral is a building without a function; this is fair enough, but in that case you are acting irresponsibly if you try to design one\u2019, which is a load of old codswallop. If you can find an earlier one, please trump me. And here\u2019s a reminder that the scheme ended with the announcement: \u201cSome Wordhunt mysteries remain unsolved\u201d: Can you prove you bonked before 1975? Did you play on a bouncy castle before 1986? Did you sport a mullet hairstyle before 1994 \u2013 and why was it named after a fish? There was also a plea for any evidence to back up or deny that another word \u2013 the subject of our next change \u2013 is a nautical acronym. The matter appears unresolved; reader, how would you clue POSH? Cluing competition Thanks for your clues for RAAB. Tomrollock gets the ingenuity award for the definition in \u201cAbracadabra: Abba\u2019s SOS\u201d and Alberyalbery made a shameless bid for the audacity award with \u201cSwedish politician?\u201d, pipped by Shenguin\u2019s \u201cBreexiiteeeer\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct has pounced on Goals Soccer Centres with an offer to buy out the struggling five-a-side football pitch operator for almost \u00a34m. Sports Direct, which is the largest shareholder in Goals with a stake of just under 19%, said it had made an offer for the company worth 5p a share on 5 September, ahead of its expected delisting from the stock market next week. Goals put itself up for sale in late August following a \u00a312m tax accounting scandal. The offer from Sports Direct values the company at \u00a33.8m, a fraction of its \u00a320.5m market value when its shares were suspended in March from London\u2019s junior Aim market, after it uncovered a potential \u00a312m unpaid tax bill. Goals employs 700 people across 45 sites in the UK and four in the US. Goals said it was discussing the proposal with Sports Direct and stressed that \u201cit remains committed to looking after the interests of all stakeholders\u201d. Sports Direct has been at loggerheads with the firm\u2019s management and unsuccessfully tried to oust the entire board at its annual meeting in June. Shares in Goals are expected to be cancelled at the end of this month because the company has said it will be unable to file its accounts by that date, due to an ongoing probe into the mis-statement of historic financial statements. It commissioned accountancy and business advisory firm BDO to carry out a detailed investigation after it found \u201csubstantial\u201d VAT errors totalling \u00a312m. The company said in August the investigation had uncovered \u201cimproper behaviour\u201d by a number of individuals since at least 2010. Sports Direct warned on Monday that if the delisting goes ahead, Goals shareholders will be unable to influence the sale process. Sports Direct, which first invested in Goals in 2015, said: \u201cSports Direct believes that due to Goals\u2019 well-publicised difficulties the board of Goals is not committed to maintaining Goals\u2019 trading facility. \u201cInstead, it seems only interested in pursuing the [sale] process whilst, at the same time through the loss of the trading facility, depriving Goals\u2019 shareholders of the ability to vote on it. Sports Direct is strongly of the view that the Goals shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider the possible offer. \u201cThe possible offer would, if progressed, provide shareholders with an exit and allow them to determine what is fair value and in their best interests.\u201d",

Currently, a single person with no dependents incurs a waiting period with $5,500 in cash savings or shares. A 13-week wait time applies from $11,500 or more. A couple or parent incurs a delay from $11,000, with the maximum 13-week period applying from $23,000 or more. Under the new rules, the six-month waiting period would apply for a single person with $18,000 or more, or $36,000 for a couple or parent. A spokesperson for social services minister Anne Ruston said the government was focused on \u201cmanaging taxpayers\u2019 money responsibly and maintaining the sustainability of the welfare system\u201d. \u201cAustralians expect people to use their own financial resources to support themselves before they call on taxpayer-funded welfare.\u201d",

When Hawkins arrived, this immensely impressive dynasty had 4 million men under arms. When slighted by Portuguese merchant adventurers who built unauthorised fortifications around trading posts at the mouth of the Ganges, the emperor swept the Europeans into the river with embarrassing ease. Mughal capitals were busy with traders, artists, poets, aristocrats, warriors and clerics, all of whom contributed to the flow of around \u00a3100m annually, equivalent to roughly \u00a310bn today, to the imperial exchequer in the northern city.</p> <p>India was an industrial powerhouse, the world\u2019s leader in manufactured textiles.

So, too, is loot, and that is exactly what the British were to extract from India over the next several centuries. For, within 200 years of Hawkins\u2019s arrival on subcontinental shores, the Mughal emperor had become an effective vassal, not of the British crown but of a private for-profit corporation based in London, the East India Company (EIC).

In other words, it seems the program was teaching its students about the complex and varied cultures of countries in the Middle East instead of how to dominate them.</p> <p>The letter did not mention directly<a href=\"http://gazaconference.web.unc.edu/featured-speakers/\"> the conference on Gaza</a>, during which several well-respected American, Israeli and Palestinian experts spoke. But it didn\u2019t have to. The DeVos-ordered investigation is part of the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to crack down on campus criticism of Israeli policy \u2013 a goal to which the administration made its commitment explicit when it appointed Kenneth L Marcus assistant secretary of civil rights in the Department of Education. That the investigation was followed by the threat of defunding is an indication of just how serious the Trump administration is about this goal.</p> <p>Marcus\u2019s confirmation was opposed by major civil rights organizations, including the NAACP and the Human Rights Campaign, as well as by the National Bar Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the National Council of Jewish Women. The reasons are manifold \u2013 for example, Marcus\u2019s opposition to affirmative action, his spotty record on disability rights, and his shaky commitment to LGBTQ equality. A letter signed by the<a href=\"https://civilrights.org/resource/oppose-confirmation-kenneth-marcus-assistant-secretary-civil-rights/\"> more than 30 groups</a> that opposed Marcus\u2019s nomination noted: \u201cMr Marcus\u2019s attitudes and beliefs fail to demonstrate a commitment to protecting students of color from discrimination.\u201d It also observed that Marcus had, since leaving the Bush Department of Education, sought to use anti-discrimination law \u201cto chill a particular point of view, rather than address unlawful discrimination\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Trump era, the repression of left-wing viewpoints is free speech; federal intervention in university curriculum is academic freedom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By \u201cchill a particular point of view,\u201d what the civil rights groups\u2019 letter was referring to was Marcus\u2019s work as a professional pro-Israel operative, and, more specifically, his efforts to use civil rights law to shut down the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement (BDS) on university campuses. Marcus articulated his strategy in a 2013 op-ed for the Jerusalem Post. \u201cAt many campuses, the prospect of litigation has made a difference,\u201d<a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Standing-up-for-Jewish-students-325648\"> he wrote</a>. \u201cIf a university shows a failure to treat initial complaints seriously, it hurts them with donors, faculty, political leaders and prospective students.\u201d</p> <p>Pace Marcus\u2019s op-ed, the threat of litigation or the withdrawal of funds would be enough to pressure universities into clamping down on BDS and BDS-adjacent activism. But, more recently, since assuming his post at the Department of Education Marcus has attempted to take this strategy even further, pushing the government to define the BDS movement as antisemitic and designate anti-occupation and Palestine solidarity activism as violations of Jewish students\u2019 civil rights. A range of groups, from the free-speech watchdog Fire to the liberal pro-Israel lobby J Street,<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/09/13/trump-administration-will-use-more-expansive-definition-anti-semitism-ways-critics\"> have warned</a> that the conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism poses serious threats to campus free speech.</p> <p>In the Orwellian grammar of the Trump era, though, the repression of left-wing viewpoints is free speech; federal intervention in university curriculum is academic freedom. The Department of Education threat against the Duke-UNC consortium is yet another example of the Trump administration\u2019s spectacular hypocrisy and cynicism, not to mention its clash-of-civilizations-style Islamophobia \u2013 among other things, the Education Department\u2019s letter accused the Duke-UNC program of devoting disproportionate emphasis \u201con understanding the positive aspects of Islam.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the significance, and the reasons behind, the education department\u2019s attack on the Duke-UNC program goes beyond just Israel-Palestine and even the politics of Middle East studies. In a Trump administration marked by unceasing staff turnover, stark policy reversals, and more general unpredictability and chaos, one of the few constants has been the president and his allies\u2019 hostility to institutions of higher education.</p> <p>There is a long history of right-wing antipathy to universities, seen as breeding grounds for unpatriotic thought, cultural deviance, and liberal decadence. The Trump administration\u2019s higher policies have largely reflected this view \u2013 from the appointment of right-wing, education war stalwarts such as Besty DeVos and Marcus to Trump\u2019s signing of<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/03/21/trump-expected-sign-executive-order-free-speech/\"> a farcical \u201cfree speech\u201d executive order</a> intended \u201cto defend American students and American values that have been under siege\u201d. And the UNC-Duke consortium letter was not even the sole higher-education-related punch the Trump administration landed this week. The National Labor Relations Board<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/business/economy/grad-students-labor.html\"> announced</a> it would move to strip the right to unionize from teaching and research assistants at private universities.</p> <p>Indeed, when it comes to higher education, the Trump administration\u2019s approach is uncharacteristically coherent, to fight its enemies \u2013 variously conceived of as liberals, Arabs, Muslims, Palestinians, LGBTQ people, people of color, and women \u2013 by enforcing ideological constraints, amplifying conservative viewpoints, dismantling or manipulating anti-discrimination statutes and, when possible, slashing federal funding.</p>",

A letter signed by the more than 30 groups that opposed Marcus\u2019s nomination noted: \u201cMr Marcus\u2019s attitudes and beliefs fail to demonstrate a commitment to protecting students of color from discrimination.\u201d It also observed that Marcus had, since leaving the Bush Department of Education, sought to use anti-discrimination law \u201cto chill a particular point of view, rather than address unlawful discrimination\u201d. By \u201cchill a particular point of view,\u201d what the civil rights groups\u2019 letter was referring to was Marcus\u2019s work as a professional pro-Israel operative, and, more specifically, his efforts to use civil rights law to shut down the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement (BDS) on university campuses. Marcus articulated his strategy in a 2013 op-ed for the Jerusalem Post. \u201cAt many campuses, the prospect of litigation has made a difference,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf a university shows a failure to treat initial complaints seriously, it hurts them with donors, faculty, political leaders and prospective students.\u201d Pace Marcus\u2019s op-ed, the threat of litigation or the withdrawal of funds would be enough to pressure universities into clamping down on BDS and BDS-adjacent activism. But, more recently, since assuming his post at the Department of Education Marcus has attempted to take this strategy even further, pushing the government to define the BDS movement as antisemitic and designate anti-occupation and Palestine solidarity activism as violations of Jewish students\u2019 civil rights. A range of groups, from the free-speech watchdog Fire to the liberal pro-Israel lobby J Street, have warned that the conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism poses serious threats to campus free speech. In the Orwellian grammar of the Trump era, though, the repression of left-wing viewpoints is free speech; federal intervention in university curriculum is academic freedom. The Department of Education threat against the Duke-UNC consortium is yet another example of the Trump administration\u2019s spectacular hypocrisy and cynicism, not to mention its clash-of-civilizations-style Islamophobia \u2013 among other things, the Education Department\u2019s letter accused the Duke-UNC program of devoting disproportionate emphasis \u201con understanding the positive aspects of Islam.\u201d Yet the significance, and the reasons behind, the education department\u2019s attack on the Duke-UNC program goes beyond just Israel-Palestine and even the politics of Middle East studies. In a Trump administration marked by unceasing staff turnover, stark policy reversals, and more general unpredictability and chaos, one of the few constants has been the president and his allies\u2019 hostility to institutions of higher education. There is a long history of right-wing antipathy to universities, seen as breeding grounds for unpatriotic thought, cultural deviance, and liberal decadence. The Trump administration\u2019s higher policies have largely reflected this view \u2013 from the appointment of right-wing, education war stalwarts such as Besty DeVos and Marcus to Trump\u2019s signing of a farcical \u201cfree speech\u201d executive order intended \u201cto defend American students and American values that have been under siege\u201d. And the UNC-Duke consortium letter was not even the sole higher-education-related punch the Trump administration landed this week. The National Labor Relations Board announced it would move to strip the right to unionize from teaching and research assistants at private universities. Indeed, when it comes to higher education, the Trump administration\u2019s approach is uncharacteristically coherent, to fight its enemies \u2013 variously conceived of as liberals, Arabs, Muslims, Palestinians, LGBTQ people, people of color, and women \u2013 by enforcing ideological constraints, amplifying conservative viewpoints, dismantling or manipulating anti-discrimination statutes and, when possible, slashing federal funding.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve always been a diligent worker. Having had a part-time job in a fish and chip shop throughout my A-levels, I know what hard work means. When I received my offer to study at Cambridge University I was congratulated by my colleagues for finally \u201cmaking it\u201d. In the warm heat of June, a few days before my last exam, I thought this would be the last time I would smell the fish in batter as it hit the sizzling oil. I reflected on the idea that Cambridge meant I was finally competing on a level playing field with socially and economically privileged students.</p> <p>Within my first four days at university, by which time tickets had already sold out for the winter ball, I realised this was not the case. Around me, students effortlessly parted with well over \u00a3100 for that one night out. I could only struggle to do the same, so I applied to work for half of the ball in order to enjoy the other half for free. It soon dawned on me that, for a working-class student, a Cambridge education did not give me equal status.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would urge schools and teachers to not raise expectations: to paint an Oxbridge degree as a working-class escape route</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, my first year has exposed the significant wealth disparities between me and other students. While they are comforted by their parents\u2019 financial cushions, I have to think about the risks I take career-wise. I had hoped to pursue journalism. But in the work is often inconsistent and poorly paid. My privileged counterparts will be able to explore opportunities in the form of unpaid internships; I need a career path that provides monetary stability.</p> <p>Research shows that Oxbridge graduates from more privileged backgrounds earn about \u00a35,000 a year more than those that are less well off. When I discovered this, I was shocked. I\u2019d been told by teachers that a Cambridge degree would be the \u201cgreat equaliser\u201d. After all, I had been chosen through meritocracy, selected on the basis of my ability. It didn\u2019t matter where I had come from. I could achieve anything.</p> <p>Now, as I enter my second year and feel closer to the jungle of graduate job-hunting, I have come to realise the power of financial patronage. These worries about money are shared by many of my working-class friends at Cambridge. One told me how she dreamed of pursuing a career in acting, but soon realised that the financial insecurity of that industry means that it won\u2019t be an option.</p> <p>I worry, too, that I do not display the \u201cpolish\u201d that many recruiters seek. At one of the first talks I attended at university, the speaker made several references to 17th-century French politicians and compared them with contemporary British MPs. Each of the examples were greeted with bursts of laughter. Did I keep missing the punchline? How was I expected to know the biography of Louis XIV? This episode made me realise how strongly people\u2019s very sense of humour was tied to class background.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/09/abolish-eton-labour-groups-aim-to-strip-elite-private-schools-of-privileges\">Abolish Eton: Labour groups aim to strip elite schools of privileges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Middle-class parents instil cultural wherewithal in their children, such as knowledge of the arts. I began to wonder: if I was unable to understand a highbrow reference during an interview, would the recruiter think I might not \u201cfit in\u201d? Would they be less likely to hire me? As I navigate Cambridge, I often feel alienated as student colleagues confidently charm their way through conversations \u2013 referencing their favourite poetry by the likes of Keats, Browning and Hardy. I could not name a single title.</p> <p>Many working-class friends tell me they often feel isolated like this, too. I worry that, in job interviews, this lack of knowledge will be unfairly confused with my ability to do the job. At Eton they learn the art of \u201coiling\u201d: how to charm your way to success. Maybe that\u2019s how Boris Johnson got into Downing Street: not by merit or hard work but because of his lessons in charm and persuasion.</p> <p>During freshers\u2019 week, I overheard a conversation between students discussing their social networks. Their family friends ranged from various CEOs to big names in the City. These often help to \u201cpull strings\u201d for privileged students once they graduate. My parents cannot provide valuable connections.</p> <p>I would urge schools and teachers to not raise expectations: not to paint an Oxbridge degree as a working-class escape route. It\u2019s an empty promise. I was sold a dream of upward mobility, but my one year has already exposed this as being far from the truth. I\u2019ve learned that our class shapes our economic, cultural and social capital, and much of our potential, from birth. This is something a Cambridge degree cannot erase.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniella Adeluwoye is an undergraduate at Cambridge University</p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve always been a diligent worker. Having had a part-time job in a fish and chip shop throughout my A-levels, I know what hard work means. When I received my offer to study at Cambridge University I was congratulated by my colleagues for finally \u201cmaking it\u201d. In the warm heat of June, a few days before my last exam, I thought this would be the last time I would smell the fish in batter as it hit the sizzling oil. I reflected on the idea that Cambridge meant I was finally competing on a level playing field with socially and economically privileged students. Within my first four days at university, by which time tickets had already sold out for the winter ball, I realised this was not the case. Around me, students effortlessly parted with well over \u00a3100 for that one night out. I could only struggle to do the same, so I applied to work for half of the ball in order to enjoy the other half for free. It soon dawned on me that, for a working-class student, a Cambridge education did not give me equal status. Instead, my first year has exposed the significant wealth disparities between me and other students. While they are comforted by their parents\u2019 financial cushions, I have to think about the risks I take career-wise. I had hoped to pursue journalism. But in the work is often inconsistent and poorly paid. My privileged counterparts will be able to explore opportunities in the form of unpaid internships; I need a career path that provides monetary stability. Research shows that Oxbridge graduates from more privileged backgrounds earn about \u00a35,000 a year more than those that are less well off. When I discovered this, I was shocked. I\u2019d been told by teachers that a Cambridge degree would be the \u201cgreat equaliser\u201d. After all, I had been chosen through meritocracy, selected on the basis of my ability. It didn\u2019t matter where I had come from. I could achieve anything. Now, as I enter my second year and feel closer to the jungle of graduate job-hunting, I have come to realise the power of financial patronage. These worries about money are shared by many of my working-class friends at Cambridge. One told me how she dreamed of pursuing a career in acting, but soon realised that the financial insecurity of that industry means that it won\u2019t be an option. I worry, too, that I do not display the \u201cpolish\u201d that many recruiters seek. At one of the first talks I attended at university, the speaker made several references to 17th-century French politicians and compared them with contemporary British MPs. Each of the examples were greeted with bursts of laughter. Did I keep missing the punchline? How was I expected to know the biography of Louis XIV? This episode made me realise how strongly people\u2019s very sense of humour was tied to class background. Middle-class parents instil cultural wherewithal in their children, such as knowledge of the arts. I began to wonder: if I was unable to understand a highbrow reference during an interview, would the recruiter think I might not \u201cfit in\u201d? Would they be less likely to hire me? As I navigate Cambridge, I often feel alienated as student colleagues confidently charm their way through conversations \u2013 referencing their favourite poetry by the likes of Keats, Browning and Hardy. I could not name a single title. Many working-class friends tell me they often feel isolated like this, too. I worry that, in job interviews, this lack of knowledge will be unfairly confused with my ability to do the job. At Eton they learn the art of \u201coiling\u201d: how to charm your way to success. Maybe that\u2019s how Boris Johnson got into Downing Street: not by merit or hard work but because of his lessons in charm and persuasion. During freshers\u2019 week, I overheard a conversation between students discussing their social networks. Their family friends ranged from various CEOs to big names in the City. These often help to \u201cpull strings\u201d for privileged students once they graduate. My parents cannot provide valuable connections. I would urge schools and teachers to not raise expectations: not to paint an Oxbridge degree as a working-class escape route. It\u2019s an empty promise. I was sold a dream of upward mobility, but my one year has already exposed this as being far from the truth. I\u2019ve learned that our class shapes our economic, cultural and social capital, and much of our potential, from birth. This is something a Cambridge degree cannot erase. \u2022 Daniella Adeluwoye is an undergraduate at Cambridge University",

Her social media profiles have been wiped clean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/22/antonio-brown-quits-nfl-robert-kraft-ben-roethlisberger\">Antonio Brown quits NFL, and references Kraft massage parlor charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This Friday will mark the one-year anniversary of Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford testifying before Congress about the sexual misconduct of then-nominee, now-sitting associate justice of the US supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, when they were both in high school.</p> <p>Much of the current related media coverage is, like that of Brown, Kavanaugh-centered \u2013 on the fallout from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/15/brett-kavanaugh-donald-trump-impeachment-supreme-court-justice\">publication of The Education of Brett Kavanaugh</a>, the New York Times\u2019 woeful lapse in judgement <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-times-brett-kavanaugh-offensive-tweet-misconduct_n_5d7e91b0e4b03b5fc8859081\">when describing a second accuser</a>, the ensuing correction, the President\u2019s defense of Kavanaugh \u2013 the list goes on. Part of what has been lost in the swirl of this news cycle is the notion that through the act of testifying, Ford offered a platform to even have these kinds of conversations. The problem is, she hasn\u2019t been included in any of them. The conversations happening now, one year after her coming forward and more than 30 years after the alleged assault, have to do with the man she accused: his actions, his character, his politics, his career.</p> <p>I watched Ford\u2019s testimony on my laptop at work. Watching her face, her movements \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the testimony of an emboldened, empowered woman. This wasn\u2019t a warrior, a fighter, or any of the other trite stereotypes used to label women advocating for themselves. This was a professional woman, uncomfortable and subject to profound misinterpretation and condemnation on a very public stage, who was coming forward anyway.</p> <p>One of the problems with conversations around sexual misconduct, and abuse, is that we tend to oversimplify the takeaways. We compress the narratives to soundbites: Did it happen or not? Can you remember every precise detail? Yes or no? It is stripped of the painfully complicated nuances it entails, of the deep ambivalences, ambiguities and contradictory feelings that can result when the assailant is a known acquaintance. We don\u2019t have enough of a safety net in place for these kinds of discussions to unfold post-disclosure, to cushion the aftershock of ongoing criticism and doubt. The alleged victim appears, discloses and is chased out of the public eye in a cloud of Twitter outrage. The news cycle and our attention moves on.</p> <p>For now, Brown remains in limbo under ongoing NFL investigation. But there is a sense of process taking place, legal formalities that will help his story move forward. What is unclear is whether these events will yield a wider cultural understanding of how to care for victims after the disclosure, or whether the headlines will peak, fizzle and dry out. Today, it is still Brown\u2019s future we\u2019re waiting to hear about, not Taylor\u2019s.</p>",

TMZ reported Brown \u201clooking sad\u201d as he touched down in Miami. CBS pondered \u201cwhy the Patriots could be in trouble if things get any worse\u201d. Iterations of \u201cBrown out. What now?\u201d sprouted up innumerably across the web. Brown, for his part, tweeted eight similar \u201cthank you\u201d messages to the Patriots for the opportunity and a \u201cJust got fired on Friday\u201d with a facepalm emoji. A sizable chunk of the thousands of comments in response to his posts invoked God and prayer for Brown\u2019s resolve to stay strong and keep fighting. He capped off his thread with a photo sitting on the hood of a Rolls Royce in front of a private jet, with the caption: Beat the odds. Brown will not face criminal charges for the accusations leading to his dismissal, including most notably one of rape in a civil lawsuit by his former trainer, Britney Taylor (Brown has denied the allegations). He took again to Twitter on Sunday morning to answer the headlines\u2019 musings himself. He said he was quitting the NFL and took shots at Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his former teammate Ben Roethlisberger. Earlier this week, Taylor spent 10 hours in discussion with the NFL investigation team going over her lawsuit. Her social media profiles have been wiped clean. This Friday will mark the one-year anniversary of Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford testifying before Congress about the sexual misconduct of then-nominee, now-sitting associate justice of the US supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, when they were both in high school. Much of the current related media coverage is, like that of Brown, Kavanaugh-centered \u2013 on the fallout from the publication of The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, the New York Times\u2019 woeful lapse in judgement when describing a second accuser, the ensuing correction, the President\u2019s defense of Kavanaugh \u2013 the list goes on. Part of what has been lost in the swirl of this news cycle is the notion that through the act of testifying, Ford offered a platform to even have these kinds of conversations. The problem is, she hasn\u2019t been included in any of them. The conversations happening now, one year after her coming forward and more than 30 years after the alleged assault, have to do with the man she accused: his actions, his character, his politics, his career. I watched Ford\u2019s testimony on my laptop at work. Watching her face, her movements \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the testimony of an emboldened, empowered woman. This wasn\u2019t a warrior, a fighter, or any of the other trite stereotypes used to label women advocating for themselves. This was a professional woman, uncomfortable and subject to profound misinterpretation and condemnation on a very public stage, who was coming forward anyway. One of the problems with conversations around sexual misconduct, and abuse, is that we tend to oversimplify the takeaways. We compress the narratives to soundbites: Did it happen or not? Can you remember every precise detail? Yes or no? It is stripped of the painfully complicated nuances it entails, of the deep ambivalences, ambiguities and contradictory feelings that can result when the assailant is a known acquaintance. We don\u2019t have enough of a safety net in place for these kinds of discussions to unfold post-disclosure, to cushion the aftershock of ongoing criticism and doubt. The alleged victim appears, discloses and is chased out of the public eye in a cloud of Twitter outrage. The news cycle and our attention moves on. For now, Brown remains in limbo under ongoing NFL investigation. But there is a sense of process taking place, legal formalities that will help his story move forward. What is unclear is whether these events will yield a wider cultural understanding of how to care for victims after the disclosure, or whether the headlines will peak, fizzle and dry out. Today, it is still Brown\u2019s future we\u2019re waiting to hear about, not Taylor\u2019s.",

Four of its stars were nominated for best supporting actress, and all of them lost to Ozark. Three directors were nominated for best direction, and all of them lost to Ozark. Peter Dinklage at least deserved his best dramatic supporting actor win, because he did more than anyone to root this dog\u2019s dinner of a season in some form of humanity. But after a long night of sustained losses, Game of Thrones\u2019 eventual best drama victory felt a little hollow.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dec3bc992643b19990fba02c3e81d48c87ab51b2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dec3bc992643b19990fba02c3e81d48c87ab51b2/0_98_2363_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You might be good, Game of Thrones, but you\u2019re no Ozark ...

Jason Bateman after his shock directing win.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Much more deserved was all the attention won by Fleabag, which took home lead comedy actress (over Catherine O\u2019Hara!), comedy writing, comedy directing and comedy series. A sweep like this \u2013 while once again hinting at the possibility that Emmy voters only watch one comedy a year \u2013 is a terrific achievement that is thoroughly deserved and just about validates this publication\u2019s decision to write three separate headlines about Fleabag every single day. I\u2019d question the directing award, because it won against a Barry episode that qualified as an actual work of art. But let\u2019s not quibble too much. Today the world belongs to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and I can\u2019t wait to see what she does next.</p> \n<p>The success of Chernobyl continues to fascinate. Not because it doesn\u2019t deserve the attention \u2013 my god, it deserves all the attention in the world \u2013 but because Craig Mazin won for his writing. Mazin, you\u2019ll remember, wrote The Hangover. If Joker wins big at the Oscars next year, as is predicted, it\u2019s odd to think that the two most critically acclaimed works of the year will have their roots in a film where Ed Helms drugs Mike Tyson\u2019s tiger with Rohypnol.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, Bandersnatch\u2019s win helped to classify what it actually was. It won best television movie, despite not being on television or being a movie. It\u2019s useful to have this level of categorisation because, if interactive dramas really take off, it prevents the Emmys from having to create a category called Best Bandersnatch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b82f1387-37cf-405e-a144-713ab561a6e4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y81YE75AJ5M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This being the Emmys, there were snubs. Of course there were snubs. Pretty much any time The Marvellous Mrs Maisel wins anything, it\u2019s a snub. This year its awards were confined to the supporting and guest comedy performer categories, with Alex Borstein and Tony Shaloub winning. But they did so at the expense of Henry Winkler, Stephen Root and Anthony Carrigan from Barry, and Fleabag\u2019s Olivia Colman, GLOW\u2019s Betty Gilpin and The Good Place\u2019s D\u2019Arcy Carden who wasn\u2019t even nominated in the first place. For the most part, the Emmys did well this year. But man, when it gets things wrong it really gets things wrong.</p> \n<p>But, really, the night belonged to the giant back-handed compliment paid to Game of Thrones. Sure, you\u2019re the biggest show of all time. Sure, you changed television forever. But never forget this: you\u2019re no Ozark.</p>",

It\u2019s usually such a mess. So last night was strange. For the most part, the awards went to people who actually deserved them. Fleabag won. Barry won. Succession won. Killing Eve won. Ben Whishaw won. Chernobyl won. All the shows you wanted to win, but assumed wouldn\u2019t because they were slightly more challenging than the usual Emmys fare, all won. But let\u2019s start with Game of Thrones, which stormed into the Emmys trailing dozens of nominations behind it, and very nearly came away empty-handed. Four of its stars were nominated for best supporting actress, and all of them lost to Ozark. Three directors were nominated for best direction, and all of them lost to Ozark. Peter Dinklage at least deserved his best dramatic supporting actor win, because he did more than anyone to root this dog\u2019s dinner of a season in some form of humanity. But after a long night of sustained losses, Game of Thrones\u2019 eventual best drama victory felt a little hollow. Much more deserved was all the attention won by Fleabag, which took home lead comedy actress (over Catherine O\u2019Hara!), comedy writing, comedy directing and comedy series. A sweep like this \u2013 while once again hinting at the possibility that Emmy voters only watch one comedy a year \u2013 is a terrific achievement that is thoroughly deserved and just about validates this publication\u2019s decision to write three separate headlines about Fleabag every single day. I\u2019d question the directing award, because it won against a Barry episode that qualified as an actual work of art. But let\u2019s not quibble too much. Today the world belongs to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and I can\u2019t wait to see what she does next. The success of Chernobyl continues to fascinate. Not because it doesn\u2019t deserve the attention \u2013 my god, it deserves all the attention in the world \u2013 but because Craig Mazin won for his writing. Mazin, you\u2019ll remember, wrote The Hangover. If Joker wins big at the Oscars next year, as is predicted, it\u2019s odd to think that the two most critically acclaimed works of the year will have their roots in a film where Ed Helms drugs Mike Tyson\u2019s tiger with Rohypnol. If nothing else, Bandersnatch\u2019s win helped to classify what it actually was. It won best television movie, despite not being on television or being a movie. It\u2019s useful to have this level of categorisation because, if interactive dramas really take off, it prevents the Emmys from having to create a category called Best Bandersnatch. This being the Emmys, there were snubs. Of course there were snubs. Pretty much any time The Marvellous Mrs Maisel wins anything, it\u2019s a snub. This year its awards were confined to the supporting and guest comedy performer categories, with Alex Borstein and Tony Shaloub winning. But they did so at the expense of Henry Winkler, Stephen Root and Anthony Carrigan from Barry, and Fleabag\u2019s Olivia Colman, GLOW\u2019s Betty Gilpin and The Good Place\u2019s D\u2019Arcy Carden who wasn\u2019t even nominated in the first place. For the most part, the Emmys did well this year. But man, when it gets things wrong it really gets things wrong. But, really, the night belonged to the giant back-handed compliment paid to Game of Thrones. Sure, you\u2019re the biggest show of all time. Sure, you changed television forever. But never forget this: you\u2019re no Ozark.",

      "body": "<p>How much can be expected of a single player? That N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is an exceptional footballer is no revelation but there is still something remarkable about the fact that the best holding midfielder in the world has become a totemic Roy of the Rovers figure at Chelsea. There he is darting across his own box to stifle a Liverpool attack. There he is slipping a pass in to the edge of the box and looking for a return. And there he is, drifting in from the right and finding the top corner with an ungainly but nonetheless precise finish. He is their alpha and their omega, their beginning and their end. He is all things to all men and by that means he might save some games \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">not this one</a>.</p> <p>Kant\u00e9 was exceptional against Liverpool, in the second half a blur, the force driving Chelsea forward. Only one Chelsea player made more tackles than him, only one more interceptions than him, only one had more shots than him and nobody completed more dribbles than him. He has, against expectations, transformed himself into a complete midfielder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Roberto Firmino rises above Chelsea to keep up Liverpool\u2019s perfect start</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But seeing him play like that it is impossible not to feel a certain ambivalence. Why is he having to do this? Ultimately, for all that it fits football\u2019s love of narrative and its continuing obsession with individuals, Roy of the Rovers football is for comics. Steven Gerrard pulled off more implausible feats than was reasonable and gave defining performances in the finals of the FA Cup and Champions League but, as his time at Liverpool showed, that is no way to mount a consistent challenge in the league.</p> <p>Chelsea had a supremely gifted holding midfielder, somebody who had been instrumental to two title wins with two different sides and had then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/15/france-croatia-world-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">lifted the World Cup</a>, but opted to bring in a very different player who operated in his position to satisfy the demands of Maurizio Sarri.

      "bodyText": "How much can be expected of a single player? That N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is an exceptional footballer is no revelation but there is still something remarkable about the fact that the best holding midfielder in the world has become a totemic Roy of the Rovers figure at Chelsea. There he is darting across his own box to stifle a Liverpool attack. There he is slipping a pass in to the edge of the box and looking for a return. And there he is, drifting in from the right and finding the top corner with an ungainly but nonetheless precise finish. He is their alpha and their omega, their beginning and their end. He is all things to all men and by that means he might save some games \u2013 but not this one. Kant\u00e9 was exceptional against Liverpool, in the second half a blur, the force driving Chelsea forward. Only one Chelsea player made more tackles than him, only one more interceptions than him, only one had more shots than him and nobody completed more dribbles than him. He has, against expectations, transformed himself into a complete midfielder. But seeing him play like that it is impossible not to feel a certain ambivalence. Why is he having to do this? Ultimately, for all that it fits football\u2019s love of narrative and its continuing obsession with individuals, Roy of the Rovers football is for comics. Steven Gerrard pulled off more implausible feats than was reasonable and gave defining performances in the finals of the FA Cup and Champions League but, as his time at Liverpool showed, that is no way to mount a consistent challenge in the league. Chelsea had a supremely gifted holding midfielder, somebody who had been instrumental to two title wins with two different sides and had then lifted the World Cup, but opted to bring in a very different player who operated in his position to satisfy the demands of Maurizio Sarri. The result has been Kant\u00e9 operating in a more advanced position that has forced him to learn new tricks. Profoundly gifted and diligent as he is, he has. He may have skewed one chance wide from the edge of the box on Sunday but he then scored with a little scuttle in-field and precise shot into the top corner. But, remarkable as that strike was, it was only his 15th league goal in a career now in its eighth season of regular senior football. Since Chelsea signed Jorginho their transfer ban has made it harder for them to rectify the situation. And so the issue persists: Jorginho, frail and neat, playing his cerebral passes and looking a little bewildered by the tumult around him, Kant\u00e9 charging forward rather than controlling the area just in front of the defensive line as he used to. With Kant\u00e9 in the side from the start for only the third time this season, Chelsea looked a little more secure than they have done, less vulnerable to attacks through that central area. But still, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that fielding him and Jorginho together creates needless complications. That Liverpool\u2019s two goals here came from free-kicks, following the concession to a free-kick against Valencia last Tuesday makes defending from set-plays a specific and immediate concern. The first was a ferocious drive from Trent Alexander-Arnold but it was noticeable that Jorginho, whose job was to charge down the taker after it had been laid off, ended up making himself as small as possible. Defending, it is fair to say, does not come naturally to him. To criticise Frank Lampard for that is perhaps a little unfair.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after achieving our target of breakeven in March 2019, we started work on tackling our new ambitious goal to persuade 2m readers to support the Guardian by 2022. Against the backdrop of a volatile political landscape around the world and with a frugal budget, we have chosen to take a bold creative approach which we hope will inspire readers to support Guardian journalism in a number of ways. The campaign\u2019s central message, \u201cHope is Power\u201d, is inspired by our editor-in-chief Katharine Viner\u2019s essay \u2018A mission for journalism in a time of crisis\u2019. The campaign highlights the Guardian\u2019s purpose to not only hold power to account, but to explore new ways of doing things, bringing new ideas to the table and giving people the facts to challenge the status quo. The result is something we are enormously proud of, \u201cHope is Power\u201d feels relevant and urgent in these disorientating times. It\u2019s a message we can all rally behind. Below is a first look at the campaign. The campaign\u2019s short film, which you might see as an advert in cinema, television or video-on-demand platforms, is directed by Academy Award-winning director James Marsh, known for his Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything. It is set to music from the Tony award-winning musical \u2018Hadestown\u2019, the track \u2018Nothing Changes\u2019 is written by Ana\u00efs Mitchell. In addition to the film, we have developed bright and powerful statements which will be posted online and in locations across the UK, US and Australia, and will feature across our digital platforms for the Guardian\u2019s global audience. This campaign is a moment in time to build on what we\u2019ve achieved, what we mean to our readers and put our stake in the ground about the Guardian\u2019s purpose is in these tumultuous times. Over one million people have supported the Guardian over the past three years, and we\u2019re constantly working to deepen those relationships, and persuade more readers to support us. We know readers believe in the power of Guardian journalism to make a positive impact in the world. Their support means we can maintain our commitment to keeping our journalism open for all. For those who are yet to financially support us and want to see us thrive, please consider supporting our quality, independent journalism by contributing or subscribing.

Fed up with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/a-killer-is-always-a-killer-gambia-gripped-by-junglers-testimony\">constant fear and human rights abuses</a>, a floundering economy and endemic corruption, Gambians voted out one of Africa\u2019s most notorious strongmen.</p> <p>The man who beat him, estate agent, businessman and one-time Argos security guard Adama Barrow, was a political nobody who united a divided opposition in a coalition, promising to create jobs, repeal bad laws and create a level political playing field. He also promised to be only a transitional president, resigning after three years.</p> <p>With the deadline creeping up, however, Gambians who voted Barrow in say there has been little progress and many abuses of power in the country since he took over.

Multiple abuses continue all the time,\u201d said the prominent Gambian human rights activist Madi Jobarteh. \u201cThe only difference one would see would be [that there are fewer] gross human rights violations \u2026 and probably the extent to which Jammeh was grabbing land [and] properties.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment in 2016, Barrow inspired hope in a cowed country. Two days before the election, a group of opposition politicians rarely seen together arrived in a clearing near the capital. This was not the kind of meeting you usually got away with attending in Jammeh\u2019s repressive country, where many opposition leaders were in jail. As uncharismatic, mild Barrow arrived, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/gambia-election-voters-polls-adama-barrow-yahya-jammeh\">mobbed by a euphoric crowd</a>.</p> <p>The elation reached its peak after Jammeh finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/20/the-gambia-jammeh-has-agreed-to-leave-new-president-tweets\">accepted defeat</a>, flying off to Equatorial Guinea with a plane full of close aides and luxury cars. Barrow was hailed by adoring crowds wherever he went.</p> <p>However, the coalition fell apart within months due to political infighting, and hopes have been deflating ever since.</p> <p>With 41.5% of the Gambia\u2019s youth unemployed in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.voicegambia.com/2019/01/14/sanyang-gambia-working-age-population-is-1256859-persons/\">according to</a> the Gambia Bureau of Statistics, tens of thousands of people each year are still risking their lives trying to get to Europe to find work. People\u2019s living conditions have not improved, experts say, and neither have basic services.</p> <p>In the official budget, most of the country\u2019s money is spent on defence, security and foreign affairs. Education and health are lower priorities.</p> <p>Off the books, the situation is even worse. The Gambia was heavily criticised in the US\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/2019-fiscal-transparency-report/\">report</a> on fiscal transparency, which said that the government had off-budget accounts supporting military and intelligence spending that \u201cwere not subject to adequate oversight or audit\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of abuse of resources, abuse of power,\u201d Jobarteh said. \u201cThat\u2019s huge frustration and, practically, people have not seen tangible socio-economic change in their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Between security spending and the high level of debt inherited from Jammeh, there is little to invest in building Gambia\u2019s economy, which Barrow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/10/gambian-president-elect-adama-barrow-vows-return-to-commonwealth\">said was his top priority</a> in an interview with the Guardian shortly after taking office. New concessional loans are making the country even more indebted.</p> <p>The country\u2019s donors are getting worried.</p> <p>\u201cPerception is, a bit, changing [on] how good a story this is going to be,\u201d said Attila Lajos, the EU\u2019s ambassador to the Gambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a degree of frustration among international partners \u2026 because of a certain kind of deficit, aspects of transition or development, or pretty much the lack of that. Security sector reform, for example, is seriously lagging behind.\u201d</p> <p>A truth, reconciliation and reparations commission examining the abuses of the previous regime has won much praise. However, little has been done to reduce the Gambia\u2019s outsize army, or remove those with questionable human rights records in the military, police and intelligence service.</p> <p>The security services have cracked down heavily on protests. In July, dozens of protesters calling for better services in the city of Brikama were tear-gassed and hospitalised. The rapper <a href=\"https://allafrica.com/stories/201909130140.html\">Killa Ace, arrested with 36 others</a> in August after protests against alleged police brutality, was only last week released on bail.</p> <p>The government is bracing for much bigger protests over Barrow\u2019s plans to stay beyond the agreed three years, however. With the political coalition he fronted long dead, he plans to serve the full five-year term and then run again.</p> <p>\u201cHe was misguided and misled into this [agreeing to serve for only three years]. There is no transitional president, he\u2019s not a transitional president. He\u2019s an elected president and executive president,\u201d said Barrow\u2019s close adviser Seedy Njie. \u201cWhen they made this agreement, there were a lot of politicians around him who were misguiding him. When he assumed office \u2026 he looked at the laws and he realised that he was elected to serve a period of five years.\u201d</p> <p>A movement, Three Years Jotna (Three Years is Enough), is calling on Barrow to step down as promised, with large protests expected in December. The government has bought a water cannon in preparation, to \u201cpour hot water\u201d on troublemakers.</p> <p>\u201cThe government generally doesn\u2019t want protest,\u201d said Jobarteh, adding that the protests had the potential to explode, particularly if the government tried to ban or limit them.</p> <p>Jobarteh said he thought people might accept Barrow staying for the full five years if he negotiated with them, offering to fulfil some of the promises made in the manifesto, but nothing beyond that.</p> <p>\u201cAnything that would look like him continuing for more than five years \u2013 I don\u2019t think these folks are ready for that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/a-killer-is-always-a-killer-gambia-gripped-by-junglers-testimony\">'A killer is always a killer\u2019: Gambia gripped by Junglers\u2019 testimony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barrow is expected to announce the creation of a new party within the next six months, to run for a second term in 2021. The groundwork has been laid in the form of two new groups, the Barrow Youth Movement and the Barrow Fans Club, which are trying to attract Jammeh\u2019s old supporters. People like Njie, who was Jammeh\u2019s last information minister, are key to this mission.</p> <p>Analysts and diplomats worry that Barrow may try to stay on even beyond two terms because, although a new constitution is being drafted that would reinstate term limits, he could decide that when it is adopted, it resets the clock on his own terms.</p> <p>If he does, he could hold power for almost as long as Jammeh did. According to analysts he is using similar tactics, allegedly dishing out cash at government events, promising basic services to villagers in return for setting up branches of the Barrow Youth Movement, and spending off-budget.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any accountability. It\u2019s very worrying,\u201d said Jobarteh.</p> <p>Lajos said that eventually, these methods could erode any of the government\u2019s positive achievements. \u201cIf the average Gambian doesn\u2019t feel there\u2019s anything better about this change, I think democracy in this country will not really prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond the fact that it\u2019s illegal, beyond the fact that it\u2019s against any kind of democratic rules, the danger is that people will perceive no difference between a dictatorship and a democracy.\u201d</p>",

With 41.5% of the Gambia\u2019s youth unemployed in 2018, according to the Gambia Bureau of Statistics, tens of thousands of people each year are still risking their lives trying to get to Europe to find work. People\u2019s living conditions have not improved, experts say, and neither have basic services. In the official budget, most of the country\u2019s money is spent on defence, security and foreign affairs. Education and health are lower priorities. Off the books, the situation is even worse. The Gambia was heavily criticised in the US\u2019s recent report on fiscal transparency, which said that the government had off-budget accounts supporting military and intelligence spending that \u201cwere not subject to adequate oversight or audit\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of abuse of resources, abuse of power,\u201d Jobarteh said. \u201cThat\u2019s huge frustration and, practically, people have not seen tangible socio-economic change in their lives.\u201d Between security spending and the high level of debt inherited from Jammeh, there is little to invest in building Gambia\u2019s economy, which Barrow said was his top priority in an interview with the Guardian shortly after taking office. New concessional loans are making the country even more indebted. The country\u2019s donors are getting worried. \u201cPerception is, a bit, changing [on] how good a story this is going to be,\u201d said Attila Lajos, the EU\u2019s ambassador to the Gambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a degree of frustration among international partners \u2026 because of a certain kind of deficit, aspects of transition or development, or pretty much the lack of that. Security sector reform, for example, is seriously lagging behind.\u201d A truth, reconciliation and reparations commission examining the abuses of the previous regime has won much praise. However, little has been done to reduce the Gambia\u2019s outsize army, or remove those with questionable human rights records in the military, police and intelligence service. The security services have cracked down heavily on protests. In July, dozens of protesters calling for better services in the city of Brikama were tear-gassed and hospitalised. The rapper Killa Ace, arrested with 36 others in August after protests against alleged police brutality, was only last week released on bail. The government is bracing for much bigger protests over Barrow\u2019s plans to stay beyond the agreed three years, however. With the political coalition he fronted long dead, he plans to serve the full five-year term and then run again. \u201cHe was misguided and misled into this [agreeing to serve for only three years]. There is no transitional president, he\u2019s not a transitional president. He\u2019s an elected president and executive president,\u201d said Barrow\u2019s close adviser Seedy Njie. \u201cWhen they made this agreement, there were a lot of politicians around him who were misguiding him. When he assumed office \u2026 he looked at the laws and he realised that he was elected to serve a period of five years.\u201d A movement, Three Years Jotna (Three Years is Enough), is calling on Barrow to step down as promised, with large protests expected in December. The government has bought a water cannon in preparation, to \u201cpour hot water\u201d on troublemakers. \u201cThe government generally doesn\u2019t want protest,\u201d said Jobarteh, adding that the protests had the potential to explode, particularly if the government tried to ban or limit them. Jobarteh said he thought people might accept Barrow staying for the full five years if he negotiated with them, offering to fulfil some of the promises made in the manifesto, but nothing beyond that. \u201cAnything that would look like him continuing for more than five years \u2013 I don\u2019t think these folks are ready for that.\u201d Barrow is expected to announce the creation of a new party within the next six months, to run for a second term in 2021. The groundwork has been laid in the form of two new groups, the Barrow Youth Movement and the Barrow Fans Club, which are trying to attract Jammeh\u2019s old supporters. People like Njie, who was Jammeh\u2019s last information minister, are key to this mission. Analysts and diplomats worry that Barrow may try to stay on even beyond two terms because, although a new constitution is being drafted that would reinstate term limits, he could decide that when it is adopted, it resets the clock on his own terms. If he does, he could hold power for almost as long as Jammeh did. According to analysts he is using similar tactics, allegedly dishing out cash at government events, promising basic services to villagers in return for setting up branches of the Barrow Youth Movement, and spending off-budget. \u201cI don\u2019t see any accountability. It\u2019s very worrying,\u201d said Jobarteh. Lajos said that eventually, these methods could erode any of the government\u2019s positive achievements. \u201cIf the average Gambian doesn\u2019t feel there\u2019s anything better about this change, I think democracy in this country will not really prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond the fact that it\u2019s illegal, beyond the fact that it\u2019s against any kind of democratic rules, the danger is that people will perceive no difference between a dictatorship and a democracy.\u201d",

If you feel you are approaching burnout, your first port of call should be your GP. \u201cWe all have stress in our lives,\u201d says Dr Zoe Norris, a GP, \u201cbut the definition of anxiety as a disease is different from stress.\u201d If patients come to her complaining of stress, she will ask them whether they have been having palpitations, panic attacks or long-term sleep disturbances.

It\u2019s better to resolve your sleep issues by dealing with the underlying source of stress.\u201d Cognitive behavioural therapy can also help address your anxiety and improve the quality of your sleep.</p> <h2><strong>Get smart about how you cope</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf you feel overwhelmed, it\u2019s usually a combination of work and home-life factors,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.andrewkinder.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Andrew Kinder</a>, an occupational psychologist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.</p> <p>Develop your support structures. \u201cLook at your relationships,\u201d says Kinder. \u201cWho are your potential allies? It may be family or friends. When people open up, they\u2019re often overwhelmed by how much support is available to them.\u201d</p> <p>Problem-solving approaches will mitigate extreme stress. If you are worried about debt, for example, tackle it head-on. \u201cGet out the brown envelopes, open them up, start talking with your creditor and negotiate. That will give you more hope than just sitting on it and knowing that it\u2019s festering in the background.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Remember: your job does not define you</strong></h2> <p>We live in a society that fetishises overwork, whether it is the side hustle you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2019/apr/23/rise-slashie-glamorous-new-work-or-ultimate-grind\" title=\"\">balance on top of your full-time job</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/stroke-presenteeism-culture-working-long-hours\" title=\"\">toxic culture of presenteeism</a> that increasingly blights British offices. \u201cAsk yourself the question: what do you really care about?\u201d suggests Prof Josh Cohen, the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/08/not-working-why-we-have-to-stop-by-josh-cohen-review\" title=\"\">Not Working: Why We Have to Stop</a>.</p> <p>Strip your workload down to the essentials. \u201cExcessive workloads are one of the main sources of stress,\u201d Cohen says. Many things that we do in the workplace to endear ourselves to our bosses or appear more proactive than our colleagues are basically pointless. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s just window dressing, where you\u2019re being seen to do something.\u201d Stop doing that and your stress levels may reduce.</p> <p>To avoid burnout, remember you don\u2019t have to spend every hour in productive or fruitful labour. Sometimes, it is good to just do nothing at all. \u201cResist a permanent state of task orientation. There are other dimensions of life, and selfhood, that are worth believing in. Reducing yourself to the sum of what you do and identifying yourself so fully with your work won\u2019t do your work any good in the long term. You\u2019ll just end up resenting it.\u201d</p>",

Develop your support structures. \u201cLook at your relationships,\u201d says Kinder. \u201cWho are your potential allies? It may be family or friends. When people open up, they\u2019re often overwhelmed by how much support is available to them.\u201d Problem-solving approaches will mitigate extreme stress. If you are worried about debt, for example, tackle it head-on. \u201cGet out the brown envelopes, open them up, start talking with your creditor and negotiate. That will give you more hope than just sitting on it and knowing that it\u2019s festering in the background.\u201d Remember: your job does not define you We live in a society that fetishises overwork, whether it is the side hustle you balance on top of your full-time job or the toxic culture of presenteeism that increasingly blights British offices. \u201cAsk yourself the question: what do you really care about?\u201d suggests Prof Josh Cohen, the author of Not Working: Why We Have to Stop. Strip your workload down to the essentials. \u201cExcessive workloads are one of the main sources of stress,\u201d Cohen says. Many things that we do in the workplace to endear ourselves to our bosses or appear more proactive than our colleagues are basically pointless. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s just window dressing, where you\u2019re being seen to do something.\u201d Stop doing that and your stress levels may reduce. To avoid burnout, remember you don\u2019t have to spend every hour in productive or fruitful labour. Sometimes, it is good to just do nothing at all. \u201cResist a permanent state of task orientation. There are other dimensions of life, and selfhood, that are worth believing in. Reducing yourself to the sum of what you do and identifying yourself so fully with your work won\u2019t do your work any good in the long term. You\u2019ll just end up resenting it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>America has a grand tradition of the brazenly dumb criminal: the kind who is so desperately needy that he brags about his guilt.</p> <p>Back in the earliest days of the new media known as newspapers, a certain Chicago mob boss rose to fame by calling a press conference to proclaim everyone else\u2019s guilt, if not exactly his innocence.</p> <p>Al Capone <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304017404575166330817151588\">claimed</a> he played no role in the gunning down of a young state\u2019s attorney called Bill McSwiggin. In fact he said he could have killed him any time but preferred to keep him alive. \u201cI paid McSwiggin,\u201d Capone said. \u201cI paid him plenty and I got what I was paying for.\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, Capone was cleared of the murder and became the darling of an insatiable press pack. If you don\u2019t act guilty, will anyone really think you\u2019re guilty? Especially if everyone else is guilty too.</p> <p>Almost a century later, Donald Trump has cornered the Scarface strategy. If he didn\u2019t think neo-Nazis were very fine people, Trump could win a Maccabiah medal for chutzpah.</p> <p>In some corner of his orange-tipped cranium there are surely a handful of brain cells that are fully aware that his entire family has engaged with foreign dictators and their oligarchs for personal profit.</p> <p>But the rest of Trump\u2019s brain is an irony-free zone entirely empty of self-awareness. So he and much of his Cabinet fanned out across the gullible media to proclaim everyone else\u2019s guilt in a Ukraine scandal that would normally lead to certain impeachment.</p> <p>To be clear, the only scandal involving Ukraine is that Trump openly admits that he repeatedly pressed a foreign leader for dirt on his political opponents ahead of a presidential election. For the second election in a row. Only this time, he could use the promise of military and foreign aid to grease his request.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth quoting Trump\u2019s bizarre explanation of this gambit in full, describing his call to the newly-elected president of Ukraine as follows: \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. \u201cIt was largely corruption. All of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p>Now Donald Trump is something of an expert in corruption, if not creating to the corruption. It takes a great deal of creativity to get your own vice-president to stay at your Irish hotel when it\u2019s 180 miles away from his meetings in Dublin. You can\u2019t even conceive of the creativity needed to explain away the US Air Force staying at a luxury golf resort in Scotland that just happens to be another Trump property.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s excuse was that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/09/donald-trump-mike-pence-doonbeg-turnberry-golf\">knew nothing</a> about the military staying at his hotel, and had nothing to do with Mike Pence\u2019s long commute from Doonbeg to Dublin. So what if Pence\u2019s chief of staff said Trump had made a suggestion about the stay? He just had great taste \u2013 like the military that loves Turnberry so much.</p> <p>Trump apparently knows nothing about his own officials lining his own pockets. But he does know a thing or two about Ukraine.</p> <p>It was at his own convention in 2016 when his own campaign chairman changed his own party platform to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568310790/2016-rnc-delegate-trump-directed-change-to-party-platform-on-ukraine-support\">weaken</a> US support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine\u2019s politics.</p> <p>\u201cUkraine has got a lot of problems,\u201d Trump explained to reporters. \u201cThe new president is saying that he\u2019s going to be able to rid the country of corruption. And I said that would be a great thing. We had a great conversation. We backed \u2013 I backed Ukraine from the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Amnesia is a terrible problem for today\u2019s world leaders. Especially the morally dubious ones who are either too brazen or too lazy to think of a decent excuse.</p> <p>Somehow Trump has forgotten about how bad a liar his lawyer is, or why Ukraine is even enmeshed in the multiple scandals that would lead to the impeachment of any other president.</p> <p>Would Trump let Rudy Giuliani testify to Congress about his own efforts?</p> <p>\u201cOh I would have no problem with it,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. \u201cRudy is a very straight shooter. And Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people with respect to your Ukraine. Ukraine has had a tremendous corruption problem. Somehow they were involved in a lot of different things that took place in our country, and hopefully it can be straightened out.\u201d</p> <p>Hopefully we can straighten this out for you, Mr President. Rudy shoots so straight that he can break land speed records for lying on national television. Did he ask Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate Joe Biden? \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/21/ukraine-imbroglio-confirms-giulianis-as-trumps-most-off-kilter-advocate\">told</a> CNN, before admitting 30 seconds later, \u201cof course I did.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow Ukraine was involved in a lot of things in American politics, Mr President. Most of them involving Paul Manafort, your old campaign chairman, now serving time in jail for tax evasion on all the cash he made from Ukraine\u2019s former president. The one supported by Vladimir Putin, whom you asked for help to hack into the emails of your opponents in the last election during a press conference.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a perfect call.

      "bodyText": "America has a grand tradition of the brazenly dumb criminal: the kind who is so desperately needy that he brags about his guilt. Back in the earliest days of the new media known as newspapers, a certain Chicago mob boss rose to fame by calling a press conference to proclaim everyone else\u2019s guilt, if not exactly his innocence. Al Capone claimed he played no role in the gunning down of a young state\u2019s attorney called Bill McSwiggin. In fact he said he could have killed him any time but preferred to keep him alive. \u201cI paid McSwiggin,\u201d Capone said. \u201cI paid him plenty and I got what I was paying for.\u201d Sure enough, Capone was cleared of the murder and became the darling of an insatiable press pack. If you don\u2019t act guilty, will anyone really think you\u2019re guilty? Especially if everyone else is guilty too. Almost a century later, Donald Trump has cornered the Scarface strategy. If he didn\u2019t think neo-Nazis were very fine people, Trump could win a Maccabiah medal for chutzpah. In some corner of his orange-tipped cranium there are surely a handful of brain cells that are fully aware that his entire family has engaged with foreign dictators and their oligarchs for personal profit. But the rest of Trump\u2019s brain is an irony-free zone entirely empty of self-awareness. So he and much of his Cabinet fanned out across the gullible media to proclaim everyone else\u2019s guilt in a Ukraine scandal that would normally lead to certain impeachment. To be clear, the only scandal involving Ukraine is that Trump openly admits that he repeatedly pressed a foreign leader for dirt on his political opponents ahead of a presidential election. For the second election in a row. Only this time, he could use the promise of military and foreign aid to grease his request. It\u2019s worth quoting Trump\u2019s bizarre explanation of this gambit in full, describing his call to the newly-elected president of Ukraine as follows: \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. \u201cIt was largely corruption. All of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d Now Donald Trump is something of an expert in corruption, if not creating to the corruption. It takes a great deal of creativity to get your own vice-president to stay at your Irish hotel when it\u2019s 180 miles away from his meetings in Dublin. You can\u2019t even conceive of the creativity needed to explain away the US Air Force staying at a luxury golf resort in Scotland that just happens to be another Trump property. Trump\u2019s excuse was that he knew nothing about the military staying at his hotel, and had nothing to do with Mike Pence\u2019s long commute from Doonbeg to Dublin. So what if Pence\u2019s chief of staff said Trump had made a suggestion about the stay? He just had great taste \u2013 like the military that loves Turnberry so much. Trump apparently knows nothing about his own officials lining his own pockets. But he does know a thing or two about Ukraine. It was at his own convention in 2016 when his own campaign chairman changed his own party platform to weaken US support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine\u2019s politics. \u201cUkraine has got a lot of problems,\u201d Trump explained to reporters. \u201cThe new president is saying that he\u2019s going to be able to rid the country of corruption. And I said that would be a great thing. We had a great conversation. We backed \u2013 I backed Ukraine from the beginning.\u201d Amnesia is a terrible problem for today\u2019s world leaders. Especially the morally dubious ones who are either too brazen or too lazy to think of a decent excuse. Somehow Trump has forgotten about how bad a liar his lawyer is, or why Ukraine is even enmeshed in the multiple scandals that would lead to the impeachment of any other president. Would Trump let Rudy Giuliani testify to Congress about his own efforts? \u201cOh I would have no problem with it,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. \u201cRudy is a very straight shooter. And Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people with respect to your Ukraine. Ukraine has had a tremendous corruption problem. Somehow they were involved in a lot of different things that took place in our country, and hopefully it can be straightened out.\u201d Hopefully we can straighten this out for you, Mr President. Rudy shoots so straight that he can break land speed records for lying on national television. Did he ask Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate Joe Biden? \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d he told CNN, before admitting 30 seconds later, \u201cof course I did.\u201d Somehow Ukraine was involved in a lot of things in American politics, Mr President. Most of them involving Paul Manafort, your old campaign chairman, now serving time in jail for tax evasion on all the cash he made from Ukraine\u2019s former president. The one supported by Vladimir Putin, whom you asked for help to hack into the emails of your opponents in the last election during a press conference. \u201cIt was a perfect call. A perfect call,\u201d Trump said on Sunday. \u201cWhat wasn\u2019t perfect is the horrible thing that Joe Biden said. And now he made it a lie when he said he never spoke to his son. I mean, give me a break. He\u2019s already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn\u2019t speak to your son? Of course you spoke to your son. So he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son.\u201d The son thing is troubling, Mr President. Troubling because you sound unhinged. \u201cBut more importantly,\u201d Trump continued, \u201cwhat he said about the billions of dollars that he wouldn\u2019t give them unless they fired the prosecutor. And then he bragged about how they fired the prosecutor and they got the money.\u201d Oh yes. The money thing. It\u2019s a beauty. Biden is smeared by the most braggadociously corrupt president for pushing Ukraine to have a prosecutor who will fight corruption. It may be no surprise that Trump is circling the drain while clinging on to his own dizzy conspiracies. His election prospects are miserable and he desperately needs another looney-tuned cartoon like the Clinton email saga. But it\u2019s still surprising to see his secretary of state and Treasury secretary peddling the same smear as if it was just another Sunday talk show subject. Is there anyone left with any self-respect in the Republican party? Step forward Mitt Romney, the former Republican nominee and now Utah senator. No really, step forward. \u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,\u201d Romney tweeted. Damn the torpedoes. The senator is extremely troubled, if not rather exercised, by the possibility of something that Trump and Giuliani have already admitted on camera. If you\u2019re wondering what the next 14 months of the presidential election looks like, you are already looking at it. The poor citizens of Ukraine have been looking at it for the last five years, ever since Russian troops marched in and unleashed their disinformation on an unsuspecting world.

In the old days, a good hacker was someone constantly on the lookout for better ways of writing code and there\u2019s a sense in which the young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/17/edward-snowden-memoir-us-government-lawsuit\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> was one of those. At high school, he resented the way homework absorbed valuable time that he would have preferred to spend at a computer. So he analysed the marking system and realised that it could be \u201chacked\u201d: if he just did the quizzes, he could get enough points to get by. He stopped turning in homework until one day his maths teacher questioned him and discovered his methods. \u201cPretty clever, Eddie,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you should be using that brain of yours not to figure out how to avoid work, but to do the best work you can. You have to start thinking about your permanent record.\u201d</p> <p>Well, eventually Snowden did, and this fascinating autobiography is the result. It tells the story of how an intense, bright, serious boy from a patriotic, quasi-military family (father in the coast guard, mother working as a clerk at the National Security Agency) came to tell the world how his beloved country\u2019s intelligence services had covertly pivoted from protection to mass surveillance in the name of national security. And in the process did us a great service.</p> <p>As a teenager, Snowden once visited the website of the Los Alamos nuclear research laboratory and noticed that it had a gaping security hole. So, being the kind of kid he was, he phoned the lab and left a message telling them about it. Nothing happened for a while; then one day the Snowdens\u2019 phone rang. It was a guy from Los Alamos thanking him for spotting the vulnerability, which they had now fixed. The man asked if he was looking for a job. Snowden replied that he was currently pretty busy at high school. \u201cWell, kid,\u201d said the lab guy after a pause, \u201cyou\u2019ve got my contact number. Be sure and get in touch when you turn 18.\u201d</p> <p>The first pivotal moment in Snowden\u2019s life was 11 September 2001. Living, as he did, in the shadow of NSA HQ in Maryland, he felt the seismic shock of the 9/11 attacks on the US. His response was to join the army as a way of serving his country. His parents, being navy folks, were not amused. The army flagged him as a possible special forces prospect and sent him off to Fort Benning for training. But a bad fall broke some bones and led to him being effectively invalided out of the service. Concluding that if he couldn\u2019t serve his country by parachuting into dangerous places that he\u2019d have to do it using his computing skills, he applied for security clearance and spent the year recuperating from his injuries while Uncle Sam crawled over his background, family, records and innermost thoughts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Instead of being in the business of targeted surveillance, the NSA had moved into the business of mass surveillance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He got the top-level clearance \u2013 TS/CSI in the jargon \u2013 which was the requirement for serving in the NSA and the CIA. But jobs in those agencies were scarce, while jobs in the contractors that worked for them were plentiful, so Snowden went to work for one of those. In the process, he discovered that much of the work of the US\u2019s intelligence agencies is actually done by private contractors rather than by civil servants. This is partly an administrative dodge to circumvent federal limits on hiring government employees and the fact that Snowden was for most of his career \u201cmerely\u201d a contractor was later used to discredit him.</p> <p>This was misleading because contractors with Snowden\u2019s level of security clearance were effectively employees of the NSA or the CIA, depending on the nature of their employers\u2019 contracts. In Snowden\u2019s case, as a system administrator (sysadmin in the jargon), he consistently had astonishing access to the most sensitive files of both agencies, access that he eventually used to great effect. One of the biggest mistakes that hierarchies in big organisations make is to underestimate the importance of the sysadmins who keep the IT systems going. They are often the people who know everything, because everything is digital and they have to have access to it to do their jobs.</p> <p>It was his unparalleled access to sensitive material that led to the second pivotal moment in Snowden\u2019s life.

He turned out to be astute and careful in both amassing the material and in choosing who his journalistic partners in the revelatory enterprise should be.

not befitting that of a Rugby World Cup, with some fans experiencing queuing delays and some vendors prematurely running out of some food options,\u201d the committee said in a statement on

      "bodyText": "After doomsday warnings over possible beer shortages during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, it is fans\u2019 appetite for solid, rather than liquid refreshment, that has created the first minor headache for organisers. Just four days into the tournament, an unpopular ban on fans taking food into the 12 venues has been dropped after complaints about long queues and food quickly selling out inside the stadiums. The organising committee said that from Monday \u2013 starting with the Pool D clash between Wales and Georgia in Toyota \u2013 supporters would be permitted to take in a \u201creasonable amount of food\u201d, and admitted that the service at some venues had fallen short of expectations. \u201cThe opening weekend has demonstrated that the level of service is not befitting that of a Rugby World Cup, with some fans experiencing queuing delays and some vendors prematurely running out of some food options,\u201d the committee said in a statement on Monday. \u201cWith fan experience a major priority, the organising committee, in consultation with World Rugby, has taken the decision to allow fans to bring a reasonable amount of food into the venue for personal consumption from today.\u201d However, the organisers added that fans were still banned from taking their own drinks into the stadium, saying there had been no issues with supplies of beer and other drinks. \u201cBeer and soft drinks provision has been significantly increased in venues, including the provision of free water stations, and is successfully meeting requirements,\u201d the statement said. Before the six-week tournament opened last Friday, organisers had predicted that thirsty supporters would work their way through as many as 100,000 350ml glasses of beer at each match. To meet the expected demand, Kirin, a Japanese brewery licensed to produce Heineken in Japan, said it had produced more than three times the amount of the Dutch beer in September than in the same month last year, Jiji news agency said. Hub, a chain of British-style pubs, said it had secured seven times its normal supply on tap at bars near World Cup stadiums. Food shortages at stadiums drew protests on social media, with some rugby fans posting photos of \u201csold out\u201d signs. One Twitter user noted that food had been hard to come by at Tokyo Stadium for the opening game between Japan and Russia on Friday, and again on Saturday when New Zealand played South Africa in Yokohama. Addressing her message to the organisers, she wrote: \u201cWhy are you hurting people\u2019s feelings and risking their health just to make money?\u201d Another said organisers had given over too much space to beer sellers, at the expense of food. \u201cIn any case, Japanese fans don\u2019t drink as much beer as the tournament\u2019s organisers think,\u201d the user wrote.",

So far their only victory has come against a bad team, the Jets. On Sunday they lost to the LA Rams, 20-13. That\u2019s no disgrace \u2013 the Rams are 3-0 this season, reached the Super Bowl in February and have one of the best defenses in the league. And yet the offense \u2013 led by Baker Mayfield and Beckham \u2013 aren\u2019t clicking as some expected. Mayfield in particular has been a concern and has five interceptions to three touchdowns after three games. The Browns still have plenty of time to turn things around but their next four games are against very tough teams \u2013 the Ravens, 49ers, Seahawks and Patriots. We\u2019ll have a better idea of who the Browns really are once those games have been played.</p> <p>-- The Atlanta Falcons lost starting free safety Keanu Neal to an achilles injury. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27676746/falcons-safety-neal-ruled-achilles-injury\">another brutal piece of misfortune for Neal</a>, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear last year. The Falcon, meanwhile ,nearly pulled off an impressive comeback over the Colts in the game\u2019s final minutes, but Indianapolis were able to hold onto the ball and secure the victory, 27-24.</p> <p>-- It was an impressive finish in San Francisco. The 49ers were down 20-17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers with just two minutes remaining. With time running down, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo connected with Dante Pettis for the game-winning touchdown in what ended up being a 24-20 victory. The 49ers remain perfect while the Steelers, still reeling after Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s season-ending injury, are still winless.</p> <p>-- The Detroit Lions upset the Philadelphia Eagles 27-24, thanks, in part, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isaCVezrRp4\">Jamal Agnew\u2019s 100-yard kickoff return</a> for a touchdown and improved their record to 2-0-1. The Eagles managed to block a Matt Prater field goal to give them a shot at pulling off a last-minute win, but Detroit were able to prevent Philadelphia from capitalizing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isaCVezrRp4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/isaCVezrRp4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>-- The Dallas Cowboys dismantled Miami for a 31-6 victory, dropping the Dolphins\u2019 record to 0-3. It most situations this would be a disastrous beginning to the season but since Miami are in the midst of one of the most blatant tank jobs in the history of the NFL, it means that they\u2019re one step closer to winning their own personal Super Bowl (aka snagging the top pick in next year\u2019s draft).</p> <p><br></p>",

With Sunday\u2019s 27-16 loss to the Green Bay Packers, the Broncos have gone seven regular-season games without a win. Their offense hasn\u2019t scored more than 20 points in that streak and their defense hasn\u2019t finagled a single sack this season. Video of the week Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 wide receiver Mecole Hardman went off for 83 yards in this touchdown reception against the Baltimore Ravens. He wasn\u2019t even the most impressive offensive player of the game, as Ravens running back Mark Ingram had three rushing touchdowns and the ever superb Patrick Mahomes threw for three of his own as he led the Chiefs to a 33-28 victory. Stat of the week Two. That\u2019s the number of defensive touchdowns that the New York Jets have scored this season, which doesn\u2019t sound like a bad stat considering it is only Week 3. But it\u2019s twice as many offensive touchdowns as they have managed. The Jets have some excuses, as starter Sam Darnold is infamously \u201cout indefinitely with mononucleosis\u201d and his backup Trevor Siemian is done for the season. The Patriots beat the Jets 30-14, and New England could have scored many more. \u201cObviously, we were atrocious,\u201d Jets head coach Adam Gase said after the game, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot to fix going into the bye.\u201d He wasn\u2019t quite as eloquent as Sanders, but the point was made just the same. Elsewhere around the league -- This is the season that the Cleveland Browns, packed with No1 draft picks and high-profile stars such as Odell Beckham Jr, are supposed to make the leap to a playoff team. So far their only victory has come against a bad team, the Jets. On Sunday they lost to the LA Rams, 20-13. That\u2019s no disgrace \u2013 the Rams are 3-0 this season, reached the Super Bowl in February and have one of the best defenses in the league. And yet the offense \u2013 led by Baker Mayfield and Beckham \u2013 aren\u2019t clicking as some expected. Mayfield in particular has been a concern and has five interceptions to three touchdowns after three games. The Browns still have plenty of time to turn things around but their next four games are against very tough teams \u2013 the Ravens, 49ers, Seahawks and Patriots. We\u2019ll have a better idea of who the Browns really are once those games have been played. -- The Atlanta Falcons lost starting free safety Keanu Neal to an achilles injury. It\u2019s another brutal piece of misfortune for Neal, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear last year. The Falcon, meanwhile ,nearly pulled off an impressive comeback over the Colts in the game\u2019s final minutes, but Indianapolis were able to hold onto the ball and secure the victory, 27-24. -- It was an impressive finish in San Francisco. The 49ers were down 20-17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers with just two minutes remaining. With time running down, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo connected with Dante Pettis for the game-winning touchdown in what ended up being a 24-20 victory. The 49ers remain perfect while the Steelers, still reeling after Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s season-ending injury, are still winless. -- The Detroit Lions upset the Philadelphia Eagles 27-24, thanks, in part, to Jamal Agnew\u2019s 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and improved their record to 2-0-1. The Eagles managed to block a Matt Prater field goal to give them a shot at pulling off a last-minute win, but Detroit were able to prevent Philadelphia from capitalizing. -- The Dallas Cowboys dismantled Miami for a 31-6 victory, dropping the Dolphins\u2019 record to 0-3. It most situations this would be a disastrous beginning to the season but since Miami are in the midst of one of the most blatant tank jobs in the history of the NFL, it means that they\u2019re one step closer to winning their own personal Super Bowl (aka snagging the top pick in next year\u2019s draft).",

      "body": "<h2>1) Emery faces tough captaincy call</h2> \n<p>Unai Emery is yet to find the right balance for his midfield but the claim of his de facto captain, Granit Xhaka, to be part of it is looking decidedly tenuous. First things first: the Switzerland international is a good player who cares tremendously and does not deserve anything like the negative reception he received upon his substitution against Aston Villa after 72 minutes. But his replacements, Lucas Torreira and the outstanding youngster Joe Willock, helped turbo-charge Arsenal\u2019s comeback while Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi played the second half like a man possessed. Xhaka, by contrast, looked hesitant and off the pace. He is nowhere near automatic selection territory on this season\u2019s form and Emery, who has delayed formally announcing Arsenal\u2019s next club captain, may have a tough decision to make. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal 3-2 Aston Villa</a></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/23/football-transfer-rumours-donyell-malen-to-arsenal-or-liverpool\">Football transfer rumours: Donyell Malen to Arsenal or Liverpool?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Matip steps out of Van Dijk\u2019s shadow</h2> \n<p>There has been no shortage of praise showered on Virgil van Dijk since his arrival from Southampton, and the Dutchman has of course been transformational, but Liverpool\u2019s standout defender during the early stages of this season has been the man playing next to him. Jo\u00ebl Matip was the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, ensuring that Tammy Abraham\u2019s rich vein of goalscoring form came to an abrupt halt, and is playing with a calm and poise unrecognisable from his first couple of seasons at Anfield, when Liverpool\u2019s defence often resembled a comedy troupe. The Cameroonian has certainly had the last laugh, having established himself as central part of the division\u2019s best defence and helping keep a clean sheet in a triumphant Champions League final. Quite where this leaves the hugely promising Joe Gomez, though, is another question. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6bc58f08-e7e6-4e84-a679-60eeecde0a0d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fFUo4uW6nGQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><br>3) Solskj\u00e6r plays the politician</h2> \n<p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r went for the carrot rather than the stick. In the wake of Manchester United\u2019s 2-0 loss at West Ham, which came about after a dreadfully passive performance, the manager suggested his team had merely been unlucky to come down on the wrong side of the finest of margins. Solskj\u00e6r would have been within his rights to read the riot act but that has not been his style since he took on the job. The initial transformation he effected after succeeding Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was built on injecting positivity. Yet behind the scenes, it would have been a surprise if Solskj\u00e6r had not given the players a dressing-down. He has that in him and it was easy to read into his decision to send them out early for the second half. What is clear is that if Solskj\u00e6r truly believes United were let down only by their decision-making, the club have problems. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 2-0 Manchester United</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8bb4f63c-c922-4ff3-b156-137211af0352\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HWPlDuWww0U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Wilder seeks improvement despite win</h2> \n<p>Chris Wilder wins the comedy Yorkshireman of the week award. The Blades manager thought his side were poor in possession at Goodison, and admitted he was berating his players until he was interrupted by a defender who could not believe what he was hearing. \u201cPhil Jagielka chipped in: \u2018Gaffer, we\u2019ve just won at Everton,\u2019\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe put it into perspective, so I ended up telling them they should go out and have a beer and not go home disappointed. I didn\u2019t mean to be over-critical, it\u2019s just the mardy-arse Yorkshireman in me. We are not much fun at times. It\u2019s a great feeling when you win any game of football, but I just felt if we play like that away from home for the rest of the season it is unlikely we will get anything.\u201d Wilder is probably right. They will not meet opponents as accommodating as Everton every week. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/everton-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\">Everton 0-2 Sheffield United</a></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/var-to-fore-excellence-goals-liverpool-victory\">VAR to the fore despite excellence of goals in Liverpool\u2019s victory</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>5) De Bruyne heading back to his very best</h2> \n<p>Can a team scoring eight goals finish a match with disappointment? With five minutes left, and Manchester United\u2019s 24-year-old Premier League record of 9-0 against Ipswich to surpass, Kevin De Bruyne brilliantly smashed home the eighth but another goal would not come. Instead, with Leroy San\u00e9 and Aymeric Laporte out for the long term, there was satisfaction the club\u2019s key midfielder was looking in full working order. Two years ago this month, it was the Belgian conducting the orchestra in a 6-0 win at Watford that was probably the best performance of Pep Guardiola\u2019s first Premier League title-winning season. And it was De Bruyne who set the tone and tempo on Saturday, starting with the cross for David Silva to open the scoring after 52 seconds. Watford\u2019s hopes of a first victory over City since 1989 met a sudden end. There was worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 to follow. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/manchester-city-watford-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City 8-0 Watford</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6b7632ad-5caa-492f-b2b2-16df39f53df7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GnwUAm2JqpI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Maddison thrives in central role</h2> \n<p>One of Brendan Rodgers\u2019s characteristics as a coach is his willingness to tinker with the make-up of his attacking unit, not for reasons of rotation but so as best to exploit what he perceives as the vulnerabilities of the opposition. That can mean changes of shape, but this season for Leicester it has tended to be more about switching personnel within that system. Three times, James Maddison has been used on the left; Saturday was the third time he has been used through the centre, a role he seemed to relish. His winner was fitting reward for an all-round performance in which Tottenham looked vulnerable to pretty much every Leicester attack. The presence of Jamie Vardy means defences are wary of exposing themselves to his pace by pushing too high, and that gives Leicester\u2019s creators a fraction more room in which to operate. Maddison exploited it brilliantly. <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/leicester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester 2-1 Tottenham</a></p> \n<h2>7) Bruce shows flexibility but problems run deep</h2> \n<p>Only 30 minutes had passed before Steve Bruce switched from a back three to a back four. His Newcastle side had only 21% possession and the midfielder Isaac Hayden was so concerned he had approached the bench to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t working\u201d. Hats off to Bruce for responding but his problems run considerably deeper than tactics and team shape. Miguel Almir\u00f3n, Jonjo Shelvey and Jetro Willems were woefully off the pace and the evening should have ended with Brighton winning comfortably. Instead poor finishing and Bruce\u2019s late introduction of Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s devastating pace and the returning Andy Carroll\u2019s aerial threat left Graham Potter\u2019s players ultimately clinging on for a point. Bruce\u2019s worry is that Saint-Maximin and Carroll\u2019s physical fragilities dictate they cannot always be relied on to rescue Newcastle. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/newcastle-united-brighton-hove-albion-premier-league-match-report\">Newcastle 0-0 Brighton</a><br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8) Saints home form remains a worry</h2> \n<p>Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl maintained he had no concerns about Southampton\u2019s home form but the statistics paint a bleak picture. Bournemouth\u2019s away win means that Southampton have won only 15 of their last 60 league matches at St Mary\u2019s. Or, to put it another way, they have averaged fewer than five victories a season at home over the past three years. At the risk of stating the obvious, that puts huge pressure on them to keep picking up the sort of results on the road that have seen them win at Brighton and Sheffield United already this season. Hasenh\u00fcttl said he takes comfort from the chances that have been created at St Mary\u2019s but the truth is that their most dangerous player on Friday was a midfielder \u2013 James Ward-Prowse. Moussa Djenepo\u2019s return from injury will help but Che Adams and Danny Ings \u2013 one goal between them so far \u2013 need to come good. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/20/southampton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Southampton 1-3 Bournemouth</a></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>9) Burnley show \u2018best of the rest\u2019 potential</h2> \n<p>Burnley rather flew under the radar as pre-season previews mulled over who might be among the Premier League\u2019s \u201cbest of the rest\u201d this term, as the prospects of Wolves, West Ham, Everton and others were talked up, but their performances this calendar year suggest a Europa League challenge is well within range. They showcased the best of themselves in a neat display against Norwich, playing with a tenacity and purpose their opponents lacked. And Chris Wood\u2019s partnership with Ashley Barnes up front is a force to reckon with, with the New Zealander finally getting the goals his performances have merited to see off Daniel Farke\u2019s side. Proper striker\u2019s goals too \u2013 a powerful set-piece header and a lovely near-post flick from a tricky angle. On their day they remain one of the best sides around at punishing defensive flimsiness. <strong>Tom Davies</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/burnley-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\">Burnley 2-0 Norwich</a></p> \n<h2>10) Jota\u2019s strike marks change of luck for Wolves</h2> \n<p>Before Sunday\u2019s game at Selhurst Park, Roy Hodgson had expressed sympathy with Wolves, blaming \u201cthe cruelty of fate\u201d for a winless run that has not reflected the team\u2019s performances. In the end, it was the Palace manager left cursing his luck after the visitors snatched a point, Diogo Jota scoring with virtually the last kick of the game. Hodgson cannot feel too hard done by - Palace dominated the second half, but were distinctly second best in the first. It had looked like Wolves would see another promising display end in demoralising defeat, but perhaps their luck has finally changed. You might also argue Wolves made their own luck. Jota showed great persistence and composure to profit from Joel Ward\u2019s late slip, lifting morale before another busy week. Reading visit Molineux in the Carabao Cup before a basement battle with Watford next Saturday. <strong>Niall McVeigh</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Match report: <a

      "bodyText": "1) Emery faces tough captaincy call Unai Emery is yet to find the right balance for his midfield but the claim of his de facto captain, Granit Xhaka, to be part of it is looking decidedly tenuous. First things first: the Switzerland international is a good player who cares tremendously and does not deserve anything like the negative reception he received upon his substitution against Aston Villa after 72 minutes. But his replacements, Lucas Torreira and the outstanding youngster Joe Willock, helped turbo-charge Arsenal\u2019s comeback while Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi played the second half like a man possessed. Xhaka, by contrast, looked hesitant and off the pace. He is nowhere near automatic selection territory on this season\u2019s form and Emery, who has delayed formally announcing Arsenal\u2019s next club captain, may have a tough decision to make. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 3-2 Aston Villa 2) Matip steps out of Van Dijk\u2019s shadow There has been no shortage of praise showered on Virgil van Dijk since his arrival from Southampton, and the Dutchman has of course been transformational, but Liverpool\u2019s standout defender during the early stages of this season has been the man playing next to him. Jo\u00ebl Matip was the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, ensuring that Tammy Abraham\u2019s rich vein of goalscoring form came to an abrupt halt, and is playing with a calm and poise unrecognisable from his first couple of seasons at Anfield, when Liverpool\u2019s defence often resembled a comedy troupe. The Cameroonian has certainly had the last laugh, having established himself as central part of the division\u2019s best defence and helping keep a clean sheet in a triumphant Champions League final. Quite where this leaves the hugely promising Joe Gomez, though, is another question. Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool 3) Solskj\u00e6r plays the politician Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r went for the carrot rather than the stick. In the wake of Manchester United\u2019s 2-0 loss at West Ham, which came about after a dreadfully passive performance, the manager suggested his team had merely been unlucky to come down on the wrong side of the finest of margins. Solskj\u00e6r would have been within his rights to read the riot act but that has not been his style since he took on the job. The initial transformation he effected after succeeding Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was built on injecting positivity. Yet behind the scenes, it would have been a surprise if Solskj\u00e6r had not given the players a dressing-down. He has that in him and it was easy to read into his decision to send them out early for the second half. What is clear is that if Solskj\u00e6r truly believes United were let down only by their decision-making, the club have problems. David Hytner \u2022 Match report: West Ham 2-0 Manchester United 4) Wilder seeks improvement despite win Chris Wilder wins the comedy Yorkshireman of the week award. The Blades manager thought his side were poor in possession at Goodison, and admitted he was berating his players until he was interrupted by a defender who could not believe what he was hearing. \u201cPhil Jagielka chipped in: \u2018Gaffer, we\u2019ve just won at Everton,\u2019\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe put it into perspective, so I ended up telling them they should go out and have a beer and not go home disappointed. I didn\u2019t mean to be over-critical, it\u2019s just the mardy-arse Yorkshireman in me. We are not much fun at times. It\u2019s a great feeling when you win any game of football, but I just felt if we play like that away from home for the rest of the season it is unlikely we will get anything.\u201d Wilder is probably right. They will not meet opponents as accommodating as Everton every week. Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Everton 0-2 Sheffield United 5) De Bruyne heading back to his very best Can a team scoring eight goals finish a match with disappointment? With five minutes left, and Manchester United\u2019s 24-year-old Premier League record of 9-0 against Ipswich to surpass, Kevin De Bruyne brilliantly smashed home the eighth but another goal would not come. Instead, with Leroy San\u00e9 and Aymeric Laporte out for the long term, there was satisfaction the club\u2019s key midfielder was looking in full working order. Two years ago this month, it was the Belgian conducting the orchestra in a 6-0 win at Watford that was probably the best performance of Pep Guardiola\u2019s first Premier League title-winning season. And it was De Bruyne who set the tone and tempo on Saturday, starting with the cross for David Silva to open the scoring after 52 seconds. Watford\u2019s hopes of a first victory over City since 1989 met a sudden end. There was worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 to follow. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 8-0 Watford 6) Maddison thrives in central role One of Brendan Rodgers\u2019s characteristics as a coach is his willingness to tinker with the make-up of his attacking unit, not for reasons of rotation but so as best to exploit what he perceives as the vulnerabilities of the opposition. That can mean changes of shape, but this season for Leicester it has tended to be more about switching personnel within that system. Three times, James Maddison has been used on the left; Saturday was the third time he has been used through the centre, a role he seemed to relish. His winner was fitting reward for an all-round performance in which Tottenham looked vulnerable to pretty much every Leicester attack. The presence of Jamie Vardy means defences are wary of exposing themselves to his pace by pushing too high, and that gives Leicester\u2019s creators a fraction more room in which to operate. Maddison exploited it brilliantly. Jonathan Wilson \u2022 Match report: Leicester 2-1 Tottenham 7) Bruce shows flexibility but problems run deep Only 30 minutes had passed before Steve Bruce switched from a back three to a back four. His Newcastle side had only 21% possession and the midfielder Isaac Hayden was so concerned he had approached the bench to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t working\u201d. Hats off to Bruce for responding but his problems run considerably deeper than tactics and team shape. Miguel Almir\u00f3n, Jonjo Shelvey and Jetro Willems were woefully off the pace and the evening should have ended with Brighton winning comfortably. Instead poor finishing and Bruce\u2019s late introduction of Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s devastating pace and the returning Andy Carroll\u2019s aerial threat left Graham Potter\u2019s players ultimately clinging on for a point. Bruce\u2019s worry is that Saint-Maximin and Carroll\u2019s physical fragilities dictate they cannot always be relied on to rescue Newcastle. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 0-0 Brighton 8) Saints home form remains a worry Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl maintained he had no concerns about Southampton\u2019s home form but the statistics paint a bleak picture. Bournemouth\u2019s away win means that Southampton have won only 15 of their last 60 league matches at St Mary\u2019s. Or, to put it another way, they have averaged fewer than five victories a season at home over the past three years. At the risk of stating the obvious, that puts huge pressure on them to keep picking up the sort of results on the road that have seen them win at Brighton and Sheffield United already this season. Hasenh\u00fcttl said he takes comfort from the chances that have been created at St Mary\u2019s but the truth is that their most dangerous player on Friday was a midfielder \u2013 James Ward-Prowse. Moussa Djenepo\u2019s return from injury will help but Che Adams and Danny Ings \u2013 one goal between them so far \u2013 need to come good. Stuart James \u2022 Match report: Southampton 1-3 Bournemouth 9) Burnley show \u2018best of the rest\u2019 potential Burnley rather flew under the radar as pre-season previews mulled over who might be among the Premier League\u2019s \u201cbest of the rest\u201d this term, as the prospects of Wolves, West Ham, Everton and others were talked up, but their performances this calendar year suggest a Europa League challenge is well within range. They showcased the best of themselves in a neat display against Norwich, playing with a tenacity and purpose their opponents lacked. And Chris Wood\u2019s partnership with Ashley Barnes up front is a force to reckon with, with the New Zealander finally getting the goals his performances have merited to see off Daniel Farke\u2019s side. Proper striker\u2019s goals too \u2013 a powerful set-piece header and a lovely near-post flick from a tricky angle. On their day they remain one of the best sides around at punishing defensive flimsiness. Tom Davies \u2022 Match report: Burnley 2-0 Norwich 10) Jota\u2019s strike marks change of luck for Wolves Before Sunday\u2019s game at Selhurst Park, Roy Hodgson had expressed sympathy with Wolves, blaming \u201cthe cruelty of fate\u201d for a winless run that has not reflected the team\u2019s performances. In the end, it was the Palace manager left cursing his luck after the visitors snatched a point, Diogo Jota scoring with virtually the last kick of the game. Hodgson cannot feel too hard done by - Palace dominated the second half, but were distinctly second best in the first. It had looked like Wolves would see another promising display end in demoralising defeat, but perhaps their luck has finally changed. You might also argue Wolves made their own luck. Jota showed great persistence and composure to profit from Joel Ward\u2019s late slip, lifting morale before another busy week. Reading visit Molineux in the Carabao Cup before a basement battle with Watford next Saturday. Niall McVeigh \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 1-1 Wolves",

Prisoners in China are often transferred with handcuffs and masks covering their faces. Nathan Ruser, a researcher with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s international cyber policy centre, used clues in the footage, including landmarks and the position of the sun, to verify the video, which he believes was shot at a train station west of Korla in south-east Xinjiang in August last year. Much of the focus of international criticism of China\u2019s far-reaching anti-terrorism campaign in Xinjiang has centred on the extrajudicial detentions of more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in internment and political re-education camps. The number of formal arrests and prison sentences has also increased.

Zon, the Spanish bishop of the Alto Solim\u00f5es, a vast diocese along Brazil\u2019s tri-border with Peru and Colombia, is one of more than 100 bishops from nine Amazon countries preparing to meet at the Vatican for the Synod for the Amazon. Pope Francis\u2019s three-week conclave, which starts on 6 October, is tasked with pondering the church\u2019s future in a sprawling and complex region where it is rapidly shedding believers to Pentecostal congregations. Among the controversial moves set to be discussed are allowing older married men to be ordained and speeding up the training of indigenous priests. \u201cThe more we can be physically present, the more meaningful our presence can be,\u201d Zon said during a post-mass interview on his veranda overlooking the River Solim\u00f5es. But it is the gathering\u2019s green focus that has triggered a political storm in Brazil, which controls about 60% of the Amazon region and has, since January, been governed by a far-right administration that has dismantled environmental protections and overseen a dramatic surge in deforestation. Brazil\u2019s answer to MI5 \u2013 Abin \u2013 has reportedly been mobilized in at least four Amazon cities to keep tabs on clergy involved in the synod. \u201cWe are worried and we want to neutralize this thing,\u201d said Gen Augusto Heleno, Bolsonaro\u2019s hawkish institutional security minister, in an interview with O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper in February.

Bolsonaro \u2013 who is nominally Catholic but has aligned himself with conservative sectors of Brazil\u2019s Pentecostal church \u2013 has done little to conceal his own displeasure. In June, he responded tetchily after the pope criticised \u201cthe blind and destructive mentality\u201d of those wrecking the rainforest. \u201cBrazil is the virgin that every foreign pervert wants to get their hands on,\u201d Bolsonaro told reporters.

He also denied the synod was designed to undermine Bolsonaro. \u201cThis is my government.

If the paper is unfolded again to make a flat sheet, what shape will it be? Prove it. 2) The same sheet is now folded again, this time increasing the amount folded over so that there is some overlap between the top and bottom flaps, illustrated below. This looks more realistic (it resembles the so-called \u2018Baronial style\u2019 envelope). By how much can the side flaps be made to overlap the top and bottom flaps, so that the rectangular envelope can be stuck down? Prove it. 3) The \u2018envelope\u2019 from question (1) is now opened as below. Can you draw all the lines this image without taking your pencil off the paper, and without re-tracing or crossing over one of the lines you\u2019ve already drawn? 4) Can you draw the image of the folded envelope from question (2) in the same way? Today\u2019s puzzles were devised by the maths writer Rob Eastaway in a nod to his latest book, Maths on the Back of an Envelope, a joyful primer about the lost art of calculating without a calculator. His book full of insightful tips on how to work things out quickly and sensibly, including a guide to arithmetical rules of thumb and a discussion of the importance of estimation.

We made posters, helped set up a charity and found the workforce. Through the studio we had a very wide social network and were able to use that to help projects like Meanwhile. It was intended to be temporary, hence the name.\u201d</p> <p>Another major campaign saw Phillips create the Iron Man \u2013 a businessman with the face of a digger. It began in 1986 when Westminster council tried to sell the Walterton and Elgin estates to a private developer. This happened to be the area where the Paddington Printshop was then located, and Phillips worked alongside residents to fight back, creating a range of images to support the campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"14c808d1abe9db1fe25879573bd05269d105042d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14c808d1abe9db1fe25879573bd05269d105042d/0_0_2021_3000/674.jpg\" alt=\"Meanwhile Gardens poster, 1976, John Phillips\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meanwhile Gardens, 1976, John Phillips</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"66d87ee64aa6152dfce20110a685f5f2d399b88a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d87ee64aa6152dfce20110a685f5f2d399b88a/0_0_2028_3000/676.jpg\" alt=\"Landlord poster, 1986, John Phillips\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Landlord, 1986, John Phillips</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAfter six years, the tenants were allowed to set up associations to compete with developers and they put in the first proposal under that legislation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/27/londons-housing-estates-and-the-case-for-community-control\">won the right to buy it</a>,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cSurveys of the estate[s] show that the housing conditions are better, rents are lower, health is better \u2013 all the social indicators show that it\u2019s a healthier and happier environment than comparable social housing and becomes a real community asset.\u201d</p> <p>Other posters addressed two related issues \u2013 squatters and empty homes. North Kensington had numerous squats. There were dozens in Elgin Avenue, where Piers Corbyn was based, while the 101\u2019ers were named after the squat at 101 Walterton Road.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f84348994cee376f9c10492e6cc46b42e165a42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f84348994cee376f9c10492e6cc46b42e165a42/0_0_3000_2194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Will Stop Westminster Council poster, 1988, John Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We Will Stop Westminster Council, 1988, John Phillips</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over in Freston Road, the writer and activist Heathcote Williams helped create the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/30/frestonia-london-commune-squatters\">independent republic of Frestonia</a>, which attempted to secede from the UK. Phillips printed posters for squatter benefits; for Frestonia; for campaigns against a proposed criminal trespass law that people feared would make squatting a criminal rather than civil offence; and for a squatters advisory service that offered the squatting community legal advice as well as acting as an underground estate agent, spreading the word about empty properties.</p> <p>Another campaign came at the problem from a different angle. While the squatters were largely white and middle-class, poorer residents, many from black communities, were desperate for secure and clean rented accommodation. Posters called out poor housing conditions, shaming housing associations and councils.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"bfbdbd7409dee0a9cb09f878cb037b5621bb225d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfbdbd7409dee0a9cb09f878cb037b5621bb225d/0_0_2212_3000/737.jpg\" alt=\"Freston Road poster, 1977, David Jones\" width=\"737\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freston Road, 1977, David Jones</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"dad781ee101643727a6111b8464ac57ed33da9b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dad781ee101643727a6111b8464ac57ed33da9b6/0_0_2000_2940/680.jpg\" alt=\"Advisory Service for Squatters poster, 1979, John Phillips\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Advisory Service for Squatters, 1979, John Phillips</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe \u2018red cross\u2019 campaign began with people who were on the housing association boards and wanted their organisations to refurbish properties rather than buy to invest,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cThey would give the addresses of empty properties to community workers.

      "bodyText": "John Phillips opened the Paddington Printshop in an old taxi-meter factory off the Harrow Road in 1974, and began making event and campaign posters for everybody \u201cfrom the vicar to the anarchists\u201d \u2013 what Phillips describes as the entire \u201crainbow coalition\u201d of leftwing interests. In addition to promoting such international causes such as the anti-apartheid movement, many of its posters were about local housing issues in this particular corner of west London, including squatters\u2019 rights, housing associations, hostile developers and derelict land. Customers were charged at different rates: squatters simply covered the cost of material, while groups receiving grants were asked to pay a little more. Posters were generally \u201cdouble crown\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s 20\u201d by 30\u201d \u2013 and screen-printed in runs of between 150 and 300 before being plastered around nearby streets. \u201cThe style was fairly eclectic,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cWe wanted to help people express themselves or find a form of expression for the campaign that was appropriate. Many of them hadn\u2019t picked up a pencil since childhood. For the left in those days there were only two colours in their vocabulary \u2013 red and black \u2013 and many of their images were from the 1930s, so we were trying to open people up to contemporary images.\u201d One frequent visitor was Piers Corbyn, brother of the current Labour leader. \u201cPiers was in the International Marxist Group with Tariq Ali and [was the] main organiser of the [nearby] Elgin Avenue squats,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cHe often came in to have posters made. There was a very crude red-and-white stencilled one about evictions that promoted a benefit by Joe Strummer\u2019s [pre-Clash band] 101\u2019ers.\u201d As well as providing a dash of background colour, the posters helped reshape the landscape of the area. One dramatic example was the creation of Meanwhile Gardens, a playground carved out of derelict land. \u201cThat was our friend the artist Jamie McCullough,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cHe had this idea you could shape wasteland with a JCB like a sculpture. We made posters, helped set up a charity and found the workforce. Through the studio we had a very wide social network and were able to use that to help projects like Meanwhile. It was intended to be temporary, hence the name.\u201d Another major campaign saw Phillips create the Iron Man \u2013 a businessman with the face of a digger. It began in 1986 when Westminster council tried to sell the Walterton and Elgin estates to a private developer. This happened to be the area where the Paddington Printshop was then located, and Phillips worked alongside residents to fight back, creating a range of images to support the campaign. \u201cAfter six years, the tenants were allowed to set up associations to compete with developers and they put in the first proposal under that legislation and won the right to buy it,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cSurveys of the estate[s] show that the housing conditions are better, rents are lower, health is better \u2013 all the social indicators show that it\u2019s a healthier and happier environment than comparable social housing and becomes a real community asset.\u201d Other posters addressed two related issues \u2013 squatters and empty homes. North Kensington had numerous squats. There were dozens in Elgin Avenue, where Piers Corbyn was based, while the 101\u2019ers were named after the squat at 101 Walterton Road. Over in Freston Road, the writer and activist Heathcote Williams helped create the independent republic of Frestonia, which attempted to secede from the UK. Phillips printed posters for squatter benefits; for Frestonia; for campaigns against a proposed criminal trespass law that people feared would make squatting a criminal rather than civil offence; and for a squatters advisory service that offered the squatting community legal advice as well as acting as an underground estate agent, spreading the word about empty properties. Another campaign came at the problem from a different angle. While the squatters were largely white and middle-class, poorer residents, many from black communities, were desperate for secure and clean rented accommodation. Posters called out poor housing conditions, shaming housing associations and councils. \u201cThe \u2018red cross\u2019 campaign began with people who were on the housing association boards and wanted their organisations to refurbish properties rather than buy to invest,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cThey would give the addresses of empty properties to community workers. We\u2019d then spray them with biblical red crosses and use posters to explain what it meant. Then the board members would attend board meeting and say \u2018have you seen what\u2019s happening out there\u2026?\u2019 It became a national issue.\u201d The print shop continued to produce posters for the local community \u2013 concerts, the Notting Hill carnival and festivals \u2013 alongside more radical topics, but community activities tapered off in the 1980s as the sector\u2019s funding dried up. The print shop formally closed in 1991 when Phillips transferred the assets to a new charitable organisation, London Print Studio. Based at 425 Harrow Road, it continues to work on community projects as well as with artists, galleries and educational institutions. Phillips made a poster for Grenfell but otherwise rarely works in that medium today. \u201cThere was a strong poster culture then,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople thought about posters and owned them and understood them. There isn\u2019t a poster culture now. Our posters contributed to campaigns. They indicated to the council and public that these were strong organisations they were up against and they contributed significantly to internal morale.\u201d Posters from Paddington Printshop is published by Four Corners Books Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe horse is dead.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the middle of a tense scene in the 1969 smash Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The town sheriff is attempting to round up a posse to track down Butch and Sundance, leaders of the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang, which has been robbing banks and trains with such impunity that they\u2019ve become an embarrassment for lawman across the frontier. Unbeknown to everyone, these celebrity outlaws are watching the scene unfold from a perch across the street, where they\u2019re blowing their loot on liquor and whores, but the sheriff\u2019s recruitment efforts were doomed to run aground regardless. There just isn\u2019t much appetite for going after an elusive and dangerous pair that seem to be generous in spreading their stolen loot around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/18/the-wild-bunch-at-50-sam-peckinpah-enduring-nihilism-western\">The Wild Bunch at 50: the enduring nihilism of Sam Peckinpah's western</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is, however, time for a brazen salesman to make a pitch: \u201cThe horse is dead,\u201d he says. The future is bicycles.</p> <p>The sequence everyone remembers from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid follows shortly afterwards, when Paul Newman, as Butch, pedals Katherine Ross\u2019s Etta Place around on the handlebars of a new bike, with the jaunty Oscar-winning song Raindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head playing in the background. It may not be accurate to call the film a \u201crevisionist western\u201d \u2013 a term reserved for less commercial visions like Monte Hellman\u2019s The Shooting, Robert Altman\u2019s McCabe &amp; Mrs Miller, and Sam Peckinpah\u2019s The Wild Bunch, released the same year \u2013 but even before our heroes meet a hail of bullets in the final freeze-frame, the end of an era is nigh. It\u2019s no wonder Butch winds up chucking the bike into the woods later on.</p> <p>Butch Cassidy was a box-office sensation when it premiered 50 years ago, more than doubling Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, which grossed $44.8m and $41.7m, respectively, against its colossal $102.3m. For perspective, only six films since have doubled up the competition since \u2013 three of them Star Wars movies (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi); two of them Steven Spielberg movies (Jaws and ET); and the other Titanic. It\u2019s important to understand the film as a commercial juggernaut, first and foremost, because it\u2019s so plainly eager to turn a horse into a bicycle, reconfiguring the hidebound traditions of the western for a hipper, more self-aware audience.</p> <p>In a William Goldman script peppered with memorable lines, the first exchange sets the tone. Butch looks around a bank at closing time, chatting with the security guard as he perhaps sizes up his next job.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to the old bank? It was beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople kept robbing it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a small price to pay for beauty.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"295449e215ae88ae3f37ec23602b3ce2ca02c6c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295449e215ae88ae3f37ec23602b3ce2ca02c6c6/0_0_2500_1868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Right away, Goldman establishes Butch as a charismatic mouthpiece for the quip-ready screenwriter, contrasting nicely with the Sundance Kid, Robert Redford\u2019s taciturn sharpshooter.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe horse is dead.\u201d It\u2019s the middle of a tense scene in the 1969 smash Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The town sheriff is attempting to round up a posse to track down Butch and Sundance, leaders of the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang, which has been robbing banks and trains with such impunity that they\u2019ve become an embarrassment for lawman across the frontier. Unbeknown to everyone, these celebrity outlaws are watching the scene unfold from a perch across the street, where they\u2019re blowing their loot on liquor and whores, but the sheriff\u2019s recruitment efforts were doomed to run aground regardless. There just isn\u2019t much appetite for going after an elusive and dangerous pair that seem to be generous in spreading their stolen loot around. There is, however, time for a brazen salesman to make a pitch: \u201cThe horse is dead,\u201d he says. The future is bicycles. The sequence everyone remembers from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid follows shortly afterwards, when Paul Newman, as Butch, pedals Katherine Ross\u2019s Etta Place around on the handlebars of a new bike, with the jaunty Oscar-winning song Raindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head playing in the background. It may not be accurate to call the film a \u201crevisionist western\u201d \u2013 a term reserved for less commercial visions like Monte Hellman\u2019s The Shooting, Robert Altman\u2019s McCabe &amp; Mrs Miller, and Sam Peckinpah\u2019s The Wild Bunch, released the same year \u2013 but even before our heroes meet a hail of bullets in the final freeze-frame, the end of an era is nigh. It\u2019s no wonder Butch winds up chucking the bike into the woods later on. Butch Cassidy was a box-office sensation when it premiered 50 years ago, more than doubling Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, which grossed $44.8m and $41.7m, respectively, against its colossal $102.3m. For perspective, only six films since have doubled up the competition since \u2013 three of them Star Wars movies (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi); two of them Steven Spielberg movies (Jaws and ET); and the other Titanic. It\u2019s important to understand the film as a commercial juggernaut, first and foremost, because it\u2019s so plainly eager to turn a horse into a bicycle, reconfiguring the hidebound traditions of the western for a hipper, more self-aware audience. In a William Goldman script peppered with memorable lines, the first exchange sets the tone. Butch looks around a bank at closing time, chatting with the security guard as he perhaps sizes up his next job. \u201cWhat happened to the old bank? It was beautiful.\u201d \u201cPeople kept robbing it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a small price to pay for beauty.\u201d Right away, Goldman establishes Butch as a charismatic mouthpiece for the quip-ready screenwriter, contrasting nicely with the Sundance Kid, Robert Redford\u2019s taciturn sharpshooter. But he\u2019s also created two heroes who break the western mold, neither justice-seeking white-hats nor grizzled, sneering black-hats, and not as traditionally masculine as either party. Butch is a man who appreciates beauty and art, but doesn\u2019t have the stomach for violence; it\u2019s not until late in the film that we (and the Kid) discover that he\u2019s never shot a man before and he looks sickened to have to do it. He\u2019s a pleasure-seeker above all else: robbing banks and trains are his way to make an easy living and enjoy whatever sinful freedoms his vocation affords him. Audiences in 1969 were all too happy to embrace the light, quippy irreverence of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after a turbulent summer, and Goldman, director George Roy Hill, and the two impossibly handsome stars made them feel cool for doing it. True Grit had performed well earlier in the year as a throwback to the genre\u2019s past, giving John Wayne a proper victory lap, but Butch Cassidy was thoroughly modern, a star-making vehicle for Newman and Redford that reflected a need for the genre to turn the page and that feels as much of its time as it does authentic to Wyoming in the late 1890s.

She was 24. A type 1 diabetic, Louis, who did not have health insurance coverage, couldn\u2019t afford the cost of her insulin doses and pay her rent. She chose to skip doses in order to pay her rent.</p> <p>In 1922 Frederick Banting and Charles Best, the Canadian scientists who discovered insulin, sold their patent to the University of Toronto for $1, hoping it would be a cure for diabetes. Today a vial of insulin \u2013 which will last 28 days once opened \u2013 costs about $300 in the US.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2019/jul/14/diabetes-insulin-mona-chalabi-data-blog\">Black, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2019/jul/14/diabetes-insulin-mona-chalabi-data-blog\">Hispanic and A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2019/jul/14/diabetes-insulin-mona-chalabi-data-blog\">sian adults have been hit hardest by escalating prices. </a>They are more likely to have diabetes than white adults and are less likely to be insured.

The group often organizes protests against the dominant insulin manufacturers in the US, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an entire ecosystem of profiteering.

      "bodyText": "Jada Renee Louis of Newport News, Virginia, died on 22 June 2019 about a week after requiring emergency hospital care for diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious complication caused by a lack of insulin, and a foot ulcer. She was 24. A type 1 diabetic, Louis, who did not have health insurance coverage, couldn\u2019t afford the cost of her insulin doses and pay her rent. She chose to skip doses in order to pay her rent. In 1922 Frederick Banting and Charles Best, the Canadian scientists who discovered insulin, sold their patent to the University of Toronto for $1, hoping it would be a cure for diabetes. Today a vial of insulin \u2013 which will last 28 days once opened \u2013 costs about $300 in the US. Black, Hispanic and Asian adults have been hit hardest by escalating prices. They are more likely to have diabetes than white adults and are less likely to be insured. One in four diabetes patients ration their insulin, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cPeople are literally dying over $300 like my sister did. It shouldn\u2019t have to be like that. People shouldn\u2019t have to choose between medications or shelter. That\u2019s the most outrageous decision for somebody to have to make, yet people are doing it daily,\u201d Jazmine Baldwin, Louis\u2019s sister, told the Guardian. \u201cShe was a wonderful person and now people don\u2019t get to experience that any more. There\u2019s no telling what she could have done, how many lives she could have touched, and now no one will know because of a $300 insulin bill.\u201d Her family is still struggling to cover the funeral expenses, and have set up a GoFundMe for support. Price gouging of insulin and other barriers to accessing it are symptomatic of America\u2019s broken healthcare system, diabetes advocates argue, and the resulting deaths and struggles of those with diabetes demonstrate the need for systemic reforms. \u201cThere is a lot of monopoly power, asymmetry of knowledge and power, and as a result you have sky-high prices across American healthcare, in particular the pharmaceutical sector,\u201d said Dr Vikas Saini, president of the Lown Institute and co-chair of Right Care Alliance, a grassroots organization focused on reforming the US healthcare system to put patients before profits. The group often organizes protests against the dominant insulin manufacturers in the US, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi. \u201cThis is an entire ecosystem of profiteering. We\u2019re going to need systemic fixes and that means people are going to have to organize and mobilize,\u201d added Dr Saini. Between 2012 to 2016, the average cost of insulin in the United States nearly doubled to $5,705 per year for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Production costs for a vial of insulin are estimated to cost around $5 while pharmaceutical companies charge as high as $540 per vial and Americans are dying as a result of being unable to afford it in addition to the expensive costs of medical care, and supplies such as syringes and glucose monitors. Some 1.25 million Americans are currently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, an illness where people fail to produce insulin to regulate their blood sugar levels. That number is estimated to grow to 5 million by 2050. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require several daily insulin doses, while those with type 2 diabetes require varying dosages. Individuals with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, are able to produce some of their own insulin, but are unable to rely on it to control blood sugar levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 23.1 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes, while millions more are either undiagnosed or pre-diabetic. An estimated 90 to 95% of diabetics have type 2 diabetes. According to a 2012 study, 2 million Americans under the age of 65 who are diabetic have no health insurance coverage. A 2017 study found diabetes is the third-leading cause of death in the United States. On Christmas Day in 2018, Meaghan Carter passed away in Dayton, Ohio, at the age of 47 after struggling for six months to afford insulin in the wake of losing her job with health insurance coverage. Carter was working part-time jobs as a nurse and waiting for her last paycheck that was deposited on 26 December as she was set to begin a new job with health insurance the week after Christmas. \u201cI want people to know that we miss Meaghan every day.

Knowing my way around a dancefloor and leading \u2013 in Cuban salsa the man is in that role \u2013 has given me back some sense of confidence, if only for a few, fleeting minutes at a time. Dancing to live music in Havana has also brought me joy, elation even, of the kind I haven\u2019t felt through music since my teenage years. Though I live far away now, I return when I can to recapture that mood. My Spanish teacher is probably right: Cuban music did save me. On Havana\u2019s rutted dance floors, I learned to move through the world in a different way.",

A letter, seen by the Guardian, is believed to have been sent to governments deemed sympathetic to the administration\u2019s view on reproductive health. In the letter signed by the secretary of state Mike Pompeo and health and human services secretary Alex Azar, governments are encouraged to sign a joint statement opposing \u201charmful\u201d UN policies that promote sexual and reproductive health and rights. The statement will be presented to a high-level meeting on universal health coverage at the UN general assembly on Monday, says the letter, which suggests multilateral agreements have been misinterpreted to promote pro-choice policies. \u201cAs a key priority in global health promotion, we respectfully request that your government join the United States in ensuring that every sovereign state has the ability to determine the best way to protect the unborn and defend the family as the foundational unity of society vital to children thriving and leading healthy lives,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cWe remain gravely concerned that aggressive efforts to reinterpret international instruments to create a new international right to abortion and to promote international policies that weaken the family have advanced through some United Nations fora. \u201cEvidence of this is found in references throughout many multilateral global health policy documents to interpret \u2018comprehensive sexuality education\u2019 and \u2018sexual and reproductive health\u2019 and \u2018sexual and reproductive health and rights\u2019 to diminish the role of parents in the most sensitive and personal family-oriented issues. The latter has been asserted to mean promotion of abortion, including pressuring countries to abandon religious principles and cultural norms enshrined in law that protect unborn life. \u201cThese approaches undermine our shared commitment to sustainable development and to achieving health for all, leaving no one behind.\u201d Efforts to advance these policies at the UN, specifically at the World Health Organization, were \u201cdisturbing and must be challenged\u201d, the letter said. The message called on governments to sign a joint statement \u2013 similar to one delivered to the World Health Assembly in May \u2013 that would be presented at Monday\u2019s meeting, \u201cand to work together to achieve an outcome document \u2026 that reflects our shared values\u201d. The May statement was signed by the US, Brazil, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Haiti, Ghana, Nigeria and Iraq. It stated that references to sexual and reproductive health \u201ccause confusion and misunderstanding\u201d. It called on the WHO to \u201cfocus on terms that enjoy broad consensus among member states\u201d. Requests for comment on the authenticity of the letter from the US State Department and Department of Health and Human Services went unanswered. The Trump administration has made repeated attempts to dilute and remove language from decades-old UN agreements. Intense lobbying by US officials in April resulted in the removal of references to sexual and reproductive health from a UN security council resolution on combatting rape in conflict. The US previously attempted to water down language and remove the word \u201cgender\u201d from UN documents. \u201cThis letter just shows how they are trying to erode international consensus and roll back the clock for women and girls,\u201d said Shannon Kowalski, director of advocacy and policy at the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s not just abortion that they care about, they care about women\u2019s ability to exercise autonomy over their bodies and about denying them critical access to the services they need.\u201d That Pompeo and Azur both signed the letter suggests an escalation of the US strategy to undermine policy statements, she added.

Suddenly you don\u2019t need to be the sort of person who starts the day with ice baths to get that first-light rush. This week, the sun is rising at 6.45am in the south of England, soon to be 7am.

Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not contagious \u2013 and there is really very little by way of rashes or twitches to give us away. Rather, like barn owls, bats or skunks, we can often be found haring through the half-light like \u2013 well, like a hare. You see, one of the great joys of our creaking, pink-edged tumble into autumn and the misty creep of winter in the willows is that regular, full-fat, white-flour schlubs can start to live through beautiful sunrises almost every day. Suddenly you don\u2019t need to be the sort of person who starts the day with ice baths to get that first-light rush. This week, the sun is rising at 6.45am in the south of England, soon to be 7am. By the end of October, before the clocks change, we\u2019ll be having crunchy orange dawns at a heady 7.42am.

It was plonked without fanfare on to the old wooden table in front of me. The wine was decanted from a battered carafe by a French hiker who had just woken up. But I wolfed the pasta down before you could say \u201cindependent principality\u201d, and did the same with the second helping. I bear no shame in saying it was a meal fit for the gods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b4cc4d49cec86711abe87069d9998361b419cdb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4cc4d49cec86711abe87069d9998361b419cdb7/0_0_951_658/500.jpg\" alt=\"Andorra\" width=\"500\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The food was, aptly enough, delivered from above. Andorra\u2019s four <em>refugis guardats</em> \u2013 staffed mountain refuges, each with around 50 dorm beds \u2013 are remote enough to require helicopter supplies. Everything from tinned peaches to wine is choppered in a couple of times a season.</p> <p>I was tackling the circular <a href=\"https://www.coronallacs.com/en/\" title=\"\">Coronallacs Trail</a>, a new, furiously undulating 58-mile walking route, devised to link Andorra\u2019s only four manned refuges and be the first long-distance loop that stays within its borders. All five stages involve between six and 10 hours of walking a day. To say I was working up an appetite would be fair.</p> <p>The landlocked, Catalan-speaking nation is a 180-square-mile pouch of the Pyrenees, with an average elevation of 1,996 metres, sandwiched between France and Spain. Say Andorra and people think skiing and tax-free shopping. But there\u2019s more.

      "bodyText": "On my second night in the mountains of Andorra, in a well-hidden hut where the bunk beds are stacked three tall, my dinner was a plate of cheesy pasta. It was plonked without fanfare on to the old wooden table in front of me. The wine was decanted from a battered carafe by a French hiker who had just woken up. But I wolfed the pasta down before you could say \u201cindependent principality\u201d, and did the same with the second helping. I bear no shame in saying it was a meal fit for the gods. The food was, aptly enough, delivered from above. Andorra\u2019s four refugis guardats \u2013 staffed mountain refuges, each with around 50 dorm beds \u2013 are remote enough to require helicopter supplies. Everything from tinned peaches to wine is choppered in a couple of times a season. I was tackling the circular Coronallacs Trail, a new, furiously undulating 58-mile walking route, devised to link Andorra\u2019s only four manned refuges and be the first long-distance loop that stays within its borders. All five stages involve between six and 10 hours of walking a day. To say I was working up an appetite would be fair. The landlocked, Catalan-speaking nation is a 180-square-mile pouch of the Pyrenees, with an average elevation of 1,996 metres, sandwiched between France and Spain. Say Andorra and people think skiing and tax-free shopping. But there\u2019s more. As well as winter-sports crowds, the mountains and valleys also attract summer hikers.

Labor\u2019s government services spokesman, Bill Shorten, labelled the doubling of the revenue reaped from the garnisheeing of tax returns \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of Australians potentially having their tax return unfairly wrenched from their hands,\u201d he said. \u201cWe support legitimate debt recovery but robodebt is so inaccurate and malfunctioning that at least one-fifth of these claimed debts are totally wrong.\u201d The ramp-up comes as the Coalition\u2019s controversial debt recovery scheme faces a potential class action from Gordon Legal, which was announced by Shorten last week, and a separate federal court challenge by Victoria Legal Aid. In the second case, the Department of Human Services has already been forced to repay the plaintiff, Deanna Amato, after it took her $1,700 tax return but later recalculated her debt at less than $2. Some people impacted by robodebt have complained of first learning that they owed the government money when their tax return was taken.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories on a very busy Monday morning.</p> \n<p>Thomas Cook has finally gone bust after last-ditch talks failed to provide \u00a3200m in new funding for the stricken travel company, placing 9,000 jobs at risk in Britain alone and triggering the biggest peacetime repatriation effort to help 150,000 stranded holidaymakers. The Civil Aviation Authority announced at 2am that the company, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/22/thomas-cook-in-last-ditch-talks-to-avoid-collapse\">had ceased trading</a> and that all related flights and bookings had been cancelled.

Boris Johnson hinted at possible government action against directors of travel firms who presided over bankruptcies. With Thomas Cook planes grounded, a huge plan \u2013 codenamed Operation Matterhorn \u2013 will swing into effect today to bring travellers home. British Airways and easyJet will be among the airlines providing aircraft to repatriate people stranded abroad in destinations from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean.

Jeremy Corbyn has tried to neutralise the contentious issue by saying the party won\u2019t decide until after it forms a government.

As she began her third winner\u2019s speech she said: \u201cThis is just getting ridculous.\u201d She could also claim a hand in another award when her writing for Killing Eve helped Jodie Comer win best actress in a drama series.

First, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/boris-johnson-plays-down-chance-of-brexit-breakthrough-at-un\">played down speculation that he might make a breakthrough on Brexit</a> this week when he holds a series of meetings with European leaders also attending the summit. He claimed that EU leaders might not \u201cnecessarily have an attachment to the backstop\u201d, but conceded there were still \u201cgaps and difficulties\u201d. The PM also told reporters on his flight to the US that the government now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/boris-johnson-says-uk-believes-iran-behind-saudi-arabia-oil-attack\">believes Iran was responsible for the drone attack on Saudi oil facilities </a>earlier this month, raising the possibility that the British military could become involved in helping secure the Saudis against future aggression. And he also had time to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/boris-johnson-repeatedly-declines-to-comment-on-claims-he-awarded-public-funds-to-friend\">deny six times</a> giving his friend Jennifer Arcuri access to taxpayers\u2019 money for her business.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018No time to lose\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Still in New York, the climate science body United in Science has warned world leaders gathering for the UN summit that countries must at least triple their carbon emissions targets if the world is going to limit global heating to 2C. The report says current plans would lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/countries-must-triple-climate-emissions-targets-to-limit-global-heating-to-2c\">a rise in average global temperatures of between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100</a>. Severe heatwaves, record-breaking wildfires, declining sea ice and glaciers, cyclones, floods and drought, have all hit sooner and harder than predicted a decade ago, it says, and the period 2014-19 has been the warmest five-year-period on record. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who presides over the climate action summit this week, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/un-secretary-general-antonio-gutteres-turning-point-climate-crisis\">\u201cwe have no time to lose\u201d</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Housing crisis \u2013 </strong>An estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/23/people-england-living-unsuitable-housing\">8.4 million people are living in unsuitable housing</a>, making them more likely to experience homelessness, serious debt and poor health .

      "bodyText": "Top story: Collapse is \u2018matter of profound regret\u2019, says boss Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories on a very busy Monday morning. Thomas Cook has finally gone bust after last-ditch talks failed to provide \u00a3200m in new funding for the stricken travel company, placing 9,000 jobs at risk in Britain alone and triggering the biggest peacetime repatriation effort to help 150,000 stranded holidaymakers. The Civil Aviation Authority announced at 2am that the company, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm, had ceased trading and that all related flights and bookings had been cancelled. You can follow all the latest developments on our live blog here. The company\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said the collapse was a \u201cmatter of profound regret\u201d and he apologised to the company\u2019s \u201cmillions of customers, and thousands of employees\u201d. Boris Johnson hinted at possible government action against directors of travel firms who presided over bankruptcies. With Thomas Cook planes grounded, a huge plan \u2013 codenamed Operation Matterhorn \u2013 will swing into effect today to bring travellers home. British Airways and easyJet will be among the airlines providing aircraft to repatriate people stranded abroad in destinations from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean. Hundreds of thousands of Thomas Cook customers from other countries are also facing uncertainty. You can find the the answers to all your questions about what happens now in our Q&amp;A here. And read an analysis from our business staff on how online competition and massive debts finally proved too much for the venerable company founded in 1841, which has more than 500 shops on Britain\u2019s high streets and employs thousands more people overseas. * * * Labour clash \u2013 Pro-European Labour MPs have succeeded in forcing a vote at the party conference today on whether the party should campaign for remain in the next general election. Jeremy Corbyn has tried to neutralise the contentious issue by saying the party won\u2019t decide until after it forms a government. But rebel MPs and activists have managed to bring a motion at the conference in Brighton that sets them on a collision course with the leader. On Sunday, activists voted for a radical policy to abolish private schools. * * * \u2018This is just getting ridiculous\u2019 \u2013 British stars have dominated the Emmy awards in Los Angeles overnight, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge winning three gongs for her series Fleabag as it swept the comedy accolades. The programme that started life as her one-woman show in Edinburgh was judged best comedy series, and she also won for best writing and best actress, the latter a surprise win ahead of much-tipped Julia Louis-Dreyfus for Veep. As she began her third winner\u2019s speech she said: \u201cThis is just getting ridculous.\u201d She could also claim a hand in another award when her writing for Killing Eve helped Jodie Comer win best actress in a drama series. Ben Whishaw was handed the best supporting actor prize for A Very English Scandal and John Oliver won for his talk series Last Week Tonight. Game of Thrones was nominated for 32 awards and came away with the prize for outstanding drama series and a best supporting actor for American star Peter Dinklage. Here\u2019s a full list of winners and you can also read how the night unfolded. * * * PM to NYC \u2013 Boris Johnson arrived in New York for the UN general assembly overnight but has been fielding questions on several fronts on his way. First, he played down speculation that he might make a breakthrough on Brexit this week when he holds a series of meetings with European leaders also attending the summit. He claimed that EU leaders might not \u201cnecessarily have an attachment to the backstop\u201d, but conceded there were still \u201cgaps and difficulties\u201d. The PM also told reporters on his flight to the US that the government now believes Iran was responsible for the drone attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month, raising the possibility that the British military could become involved in helping secure the Saudis against future aggression. And he also had time to deny six times giving his friend Jennifer Arcuri access to taxpayers\u2019 money for her business. * * * \u2018No time to lose\u2019 \u2013 Still in New York, the climate science body United in Science has warned world leaders gathering for the UN summit that countries must at least triple their carbon emissions targets if the world is going to limit global heating to 2C. The report says current plans would lead to a rise in average global temperatures of between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100. Severe heatwaves, record-breaking wildfires, declining sea ice and glaciers, cyclones, floods and drought, have all hit sooner and harder than predicted a decade ago, it says, and the period 2014-19 has been the warmest five-year-period on record. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who presides over the climate action summit this week, says \u201cwe have no time to lose\u201d. * * * Housing crisis \u2013 An estimated 8.4 million people are living in unsuitable housing, making them more likely to experience homelessness, serious debt and poor health . A survey of 40,000 people for the National Housing Federation estimated that 3.6 million are living in an overcrowded home, 2.5 million are unable to afford their rent or mortgage and 2.5 million cannot afford to move out of house shares or their parents\u2019 house. Another study today shows that the number of empty houses in Britain increased by almost 11,000 to 216,000 last year. Today in Focus podcast In the weeks leading up to the war in Iraq, Katharine Gun exposed a US plot to spy on the UN in leaks published in the Observer. She joins former Observer journalist Martin Bright to tell their story ahead of a forthcoming Hollywood adaptation. Plus the BBC\u2019s Carrie Gracie on how she fought for equal pay. Lunchtime read: Family demands answers to Wallenberg wartime mystery The mysterious end to the heroic life of Raoul Wallenberg has puzzled and troubled historians, governments and his family since he disappeared into the Soviet prison system in 1945. The Swedish diplomat had by that time saved an estimated 30,000 Hungarian Jews from the Nazi deaths camps but it has never been established exactly how, when or where he perished. This week his nieces are travelling to Stockholm to demand \u201cspecific answers to specific questions\u201d after what they believe has been a decades-long coverup. \u201cHis story is unfinished \u2013 the mystery must be resolved. There are still so many closed doors, and we must have help in opening them,\u201d says his niece Marie von Dardel-Dupuy. Sport Billy Vunipola, the England No 8 with Tongan heritage, is unbowed after emerging unscathed from a bruising Rugby World Cup encounter and here are five talking points from the match. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta was denied an equaliser for Chelsea against Liverpool before the Reds took a 2-0 lead as an imperfect VAR system continues to prevail at important moments in the Premier League. Sebastian Vettel won the Singapore Grand Prix in a Ferrari one-two finish, but Charles Leclerc was unhappy with team orders. And Danny Willett says he is enjoying his golf again after winning the PGA Championship at Wentworth. Business A grim warning about the perils of a no-deal Brexit comes from the European car industry, whose leading lights say today that it will have a \u201cseismic\u201d impact on the automotive sector. The FTSE100 is expected to open flat this morning despite a positive move by Asian stocks overnight on reports that renewed US-China trade talks had gone reasonably well. Sterling is sitting at $1.249 and \u20ac1.132. The papers The Labour party\u2019s Brexit woes provide the lead for several papers. The Guardian splashes with \u201cRevolt over Brexit policy throws Labour into chaos\u201d while the Telegraph reports \u201cLabour will be crushed over Brexit, Corbyn told\u201d. The i cuts to the chase and announces \u201cLabour civil war\u201d.

The prime minister said that in the wake of the collapse of the budget airline Monarch and Thomas Cook, it was time to \u201creflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivised to sort such matters out\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson said it did not seem the government could have done more to help, for example agreeing to Thomas Cook\u2019s request for a \u00a3150m bailout. \u201cIt is a very difficult situation, and obviously our thoughts are very much with the customers of Thomas Cook, the holidaymakers, who may now face difficulties getting home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do our level best to get them home.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that airlines including British Airways and easyJet will be involved in the airlift for holidaymakers using Thomas Cook, whose destinations range from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean.</p> \n<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government had contingency plans in place for passengers and sought to reassure holidaymakers that they would not end up stuck overseas. The company had appealed to ministers for a bailout but Raab said the government did not \u201csystemically step in\u201d unless it was in the national interest.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would wait to see and hope that [Thomas Cook] can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we\u2019ve got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded,\u201d Raab told the BBC.</p> \n<p>A last-ditch meeting at a law firm in central London between Thomas Cook executives and stakeholders including the firm\u2019s largest shareholder, Chinese conglomerate Fosun, came to a close after 5pm on Sunday, ending talks that began at 9am. </p> \n<p>The tour operator is understood to have made a number of proposals, including asking lenders to reduce a \u00a3200m demand for extra funding and for credit card companies to release about \u00a350m of cash they are holding as collateral against Thomas Cook bookings.</p> \n<p>Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauserleft the meeting through the City law firm\u2019s loading bay flanked by colleagues without saying anything about the deal.

The 11th-hour meeting came after the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/28/thomas-cook-agrees-terms-of-900m-rescue-deal-with-fosun\">had agreed a \u00a3900m bailout</a> \u2013 but was then told to find another \u00a3200m, which proved a step too far.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Thomas Cook holidaymakers were anxious that they might be evicted from their hotels or charged again for their holidays. Holiday companies do not normally pay hotels until up to 90 days after guests have left.</p> \n<p>Customers at a hotel in Tunisia reported being locked in by security guards as the hotel demanded extra money, fearing it would not be paid by Thomas Cook.

Atol covers holiday accommodation as well as return flights if customers are abroad at the time of a collapse. Future bookings are also protected.</p> \n<p>The total cost of holidaymakers\u2019 guarantees to be paid by the Atol scheme \u2013 underwritten by the Civil Aviation Authority watchdog \u2013 is an estimated \u00a3600m now that the company has gone bust. </p> \n<p>The business, which also has significant operations in mainland Europe, employs 21,000 people, including 9,000 in the UK. It has a total of 600,000 people on holiday currently, including British travellers, with Germany and Scandinavia among its major customer bases alongside Britain.

The first such outing to be run for commercial purposes was a trip to Liverpool in 1845.</p>\n    <p>Over the next decade or so, the business expanded to offer overseas trips, to France, Switzerland, Italy and beyond, to the US, Egypt and India.</p>\n    <p>His more business-minded son John expanded the tour operator and its reach was such that the government enlisted its expertise in an effort, ultimately in vain, to relieve General Gordon at the siege of Khartoum in 1885.</p>\n    <p>John\u2019s three sons inherited the business, which incorporated as Thos Cook &amp; Son Ltd in 1924 and benefited from the increasing ease of international travel.</p>\n    <p>Its first flirtation with collapse came during the second world war, when the government requisitioned some of its assets and it was sold to Britain\u2019s railway companies, effectively a nationalisation.</p>\n    <p>But it boomed in the postwar years as growing prosperity fuelled the appetite for holidays and it returned to private ownership in 1972.</p>\n    <p>Since then, it has changed hands and changed shape via a series of mergers and takeovers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/27/thomas-cook-short-sellers\">It nearly collapsed in 2011</a> but averted its demise with a bailout deal funded by banks.</p>\n    <p>Now, after 178 years of operation, it has ceased trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/21/thomas-cook-holiday-nightmare-big-debts-bad-luck-brink\">Holiday nightmare: big debts and bad luck push Thomas Cook to the brink</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mike Churcher, a 63-year-old retiree, who is currently on a Thomas Cook package holiday with his wife and 22-year-old son at the Royal Wings hotel in Antalya, Turkey, said he also feared being thrown out of his hotel.</p> \n<p>He told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s no information.

But it would be another four years before Cook got into the tourist business proper, organising train trips from Leicester, Nottingham and Derby to Liverpool. Scottish tours and trips to mainland Europe soon followed.</p> \n<p>In 1928 the family sold up to the Belgian owners of the Orient Express, but the second world war saw it become part of the nationalised British Railways. After the war, sales took off again with the era of package holidays.

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has ceased trading after talks failed to produce a funding lifeline for the ailing travel company, placing 9,000 British jobs at risk and triggering a huge repatriation effort to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers overseas. The Civil Aviation Authority announced at 2am on Monday morning that the world\u2019s oldest holiday company had gone into liquidation and that all flights and bookings had been cancelled. \u201cThomas Cook Group, including the UK tour operator and airline, has ceased trading with immediate effect,\u201d the aviation regulator said in a statement. \u201cAll Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and holidays, have now been cancelled.\u201d The official administration was timed for the early hours when the largest number of the 94-strong fleet of planes were on the ground. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, said the tour operator\u2019s collapse was a \u201cmatter of profound regret\u201d as he apologised to the company\u2019s \u201cmillions of customers, and thousands of employees\u201d. The government and the CAA have now triggered the UK\u2019s largest ever peacetime repatriation \u2013 codenamed Operation Matterhorn \u2013 to bring holidaymakers home. Speaking to reporters on his plane heading to the UN general assembly in New York, Boris Johnson hinted at possible government action against directors of travel firms who presided over bankruptcies. The prime minister said that in the wake of the collapse of the budget airline Monarch and Thomas Cook, it was time to \u201creflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivised to sort such matters out\u201d. Johnson said it did not seem the government could have done more to help, for example agreeing to Thomas Cook\u2019s request for a \u00a3150m bailout. \u201cIt is a very difficult situation, and obviously our thoughts are very much with the customers of Thomas Cook, the holidaymakers, who may now face difficulties getting home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do our level best to get them home.\u201d The Guardian understands that airlines including British Airways and easyJet will be involved in the airlift for holidaymakers using Thomas Cook, whose destinations range from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government had contingency plans in place for passengers and sought to reassure holidaymakers that they would not end up stuck overseas. The company had appealed to ministers for a bailout but Raab said the government did not \u201csystemically step in\u201d unless it was in the national interest. \u201cWe would wait to see and hope that [Thomas Cook] can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we\u2019ve got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded,\u201d Raab told the BBC. A last-ditch meeting at a law firm in central London between Thomas Cook executives and stakeholders including the firm\u2019s largest shareholder, Chinese conglomerate Fosun, came to a close after 5pm on Sunday, ending talks that began at 9am. The tour operator is understood to have made a number of proposals, including asking lenders to reduce a \u00a3200m demand for extra funding and for credit card companies to release about \u00a350m of cash they are holding as collateral against Thomas Cook bookings. Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauserleft the meeting through the City law firm\u2019s loading bay flanked by colleagues without saying anything about the deal. He also stayed quiet when asked if he had any message for customers trapped abroad. Thomas Cook has struggled to cope with a \u00a31.7bn debt burden. The 11th-hour meeting came after the company had agreed a \u00a3900m bailout \u2013 but was then told to find another \u00a3200m, which proved a step too far. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook holidaymakers were anxious that they might be evicted from their hotels or charged again for their holidays. Holiday companies do not normally pay hotels until up to 90 days after guests have left. Customers at a hotel in Tunisia reported being locked in by security guards as the hotel demanded extra money, fearing it would not be paid by Thomas Cook. However, the company said the dispute had been resolved and holidaymakers were able to leave the hotel. Thomas Cook also attempted to reassure worried customers that their package holidays were protected under the Atol scheme, which guarantees the bookings of package holidaymakers. Atol covers holiday accommodation as well as return flights if customers are abroad at the time of a collapse. Future bookings are also protected. The total cost of holidaymakers\u2019 guarantees to be paid by the Atol scheme \u2013 underwritten by the Civil Aviation Authority watchdog \u2013 is an estimated \u00a3600m now that the company has gone bust. The business, which also has significant operations in mainland Europe, employs 21,000 people, including 9,000 in the UK. It has a total of 600,000 people on holiday currently, including British travellers, with Germany and Scandinavia among its major customer bases alongside Britain. It also operates about 560 shops on UK high streets. Mike Churcher, a 63-year-old retiree, who is currently on a Thomas Cook package holiday with his wife and 22-year-old son at the Royal Wings hotel in Antalya, Turkey, said he also feared being thrown out of his hotel. He told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s no information. It\u2019s all very stoic \u2013 we\u2019re all stiff upper lip, they\u2019re all tight-lipped \u2026 we don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been paid for our holiday [by Thomas Cook] yet so we\u2019re worried they may throw us out \u2026 my concern is that if Thomas Cook goes under we could get turfed out. The Royal Wings staff are being very nice now though.\u201d Bryan Ferriman, 82, who is staying on Greek island of Leros with his wife, Louise Robertson, and has flights back to the UK with the tour operator booked for later this week. He said: \u201cWe have a flight from Kos to Birmingham late evening on Thursday \u2026 Kos airport is not a good place to be stranded in. I have tried to email Thomas Cook but this is impossible and phoning is futile.\u201d Revealing that the couple had made a flight-only booking that is not covered by Atol, he added: \u201cWe are independent and the suggestion is that this is a disadvantage given the present circumstances and that package holiday people will get preference in any rescue operation. \u201cI am familiar enough with this country to possibly find a room in a town five miles away, but who carries the cost here? \u201d The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), a trade union that represents workers at the company, said the British government should be ready to assist with \u201creal financial support\u201d. Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by Derbyshire cabinet-maker Thomas Cook. The first Thomas Cook holiday took customers 12 miles by train from Leicester to a temperance meeting in Loughborough. But it would be another four years before Cook got into the tourist business proper, organising train trips from Leicester, Nottingham and Derby to Liverpool. Scottish tours and trips to mainland Europe soon followed. In 1928 the family sold up to the Belgian owners of the Orient Express, but the second world war saw it become part of the nationalised British Railways. After the war, sales took off again with the era of package holidays. By 1950, more than a million Britons were travelling abroad each year, mainly to France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Thomas Cook returned to private ownership in 1972 and has seen a series of mergers and takeovers. In 2007, it merged with the UK-listed owner of Airtours, MyTravel Group, which nearly collapsed in 2011 but was bailed out by its banks. The rescue left Thomas Cook with a debt burden of \u00a31.7bn and the company struggled to cope, leaving administration as the only option. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 September 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said that Thomas Cook had gone into administration.",

      "bodyText": "A health check of Britain\u2019s manufacturers has shown thatsome of the most economically and socially deprived areas in UK are highly exposed to the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Exporters are already suffering losses, especially in Wales, north-east England, Yorkshire and Humberside, which have a significant exposure to trade with the EU, according to a report by manufacturing trade body Make UK and business advisory firm BDO. The East Midlands is also at risk, with manufacturing accounting for almost a fifth of its economy. The EU is its biggest market, accounting for just over half its exports. According to Make UK, given Wales and the north-east both contain some of the most economically disadvantaged areas of the UK, a hard Brexit is likely to prove especially damaging. The report also warned that the US-China trade war was affecting domestic manufacturing. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, said: \u201cAlthough Brexit stockpiling put manufacturing on steroids for a little while, the industry has since gone almost cold turkey and the overall picture over the last year now shows Brexit, global trade wars and the economic downturn in major markets are menacing UK manufacturers. \u201cIn particular, there are some regions of the UK with a very high exposure to trade with the EU and who are likely to suffer a disproportionate double whammy to their economies and jobs from a damaging no-deal exit.\u201d Last week, the Resolution Foundation said ministers would need to find at least \u00a360bn to protect families and compensate businesses damaged by the dramatic fall in trade that is expected should the UK quit the EU without a deal on 31 October. Official figures have show that manufacturers last month recorded the sharpest drop in factory output for seven years following a sharp decline in new orders. Ongoing difficulties in the automotive sector are having an \u201cominous\u201d impact on manufacturing and regions most closely linked to the industry, such as the West Midlands and the north-east, can expect to see further declines, according to the report. Tom Lawton, of BDO, said: \u201cThe long-term uncertainties around Brexit, minimal progress on the government\u2019s industrial strategy, technological disruption, skills shortages and heightened global competition are all taking their toll on the performance of manufacturers across the UK. \u201cCompanies are already holding back on investment as a result of the prolonged period of Brexit instability and risk lagging behind their global competitors when it comes to the uptake of industry processes and technology. It will be difficult for many manufacturers to regain lost ground in these areas particularly as digital transformation picks up pace.\u201d A Government spokesperson said: \u201cWe want every part of our country to benefit from the opportunities of Brexit. On 31 October, we would prefer to leave with a deal \u2013 and we will work in an energetic and determined way to get that better deal - but we are making all necessary preparations to make sure we are fully ready if that is not possible, including guaranteeing EU-funded programmes to give certainty to UK organisations receiving and applying for funding. \u201cWe are determined to level up every part of the country which is why we are investing billions of pounds through City and Growth deals across all parts of the UK, and launched the \u00a33.6 billion Towns Fund to create jobs, boost economic growth and deliver prosperity everywhere.",

After all, this is the city that gave birth to both the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which eventually merged to form the AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s largest federation of unions, as well as the USW.

      "bodyText": "The first time Nabisco tried to close its Pittsburgh factory in 1982, a coalition of labor unions and politicians successfully fought back, preserving hundreds of jobs and the smell of baking cookies in the city\u2019s East Liberty neighborhood. Sixteen years, three free-market presidents and numerous international trade deals later, Nabisco successfully shuttered the plant for good, laying off about 350 workers and leaving behind a hulking brick monument to the Pennsylvania city\u2019s storied industrial past. Today, the old factory building has been transformed into a shiny testament to Pittsburgh\u2019s future: the luxuriously renovated Bakery Square is home to hundreds of Google employees, assembly lines and industrial ovens replaced with cubicles, meeting rooms and an indoor bamboo garden, the only hint of the manufacturing past in a few tasteful design flourishes. On Tuesday, Google\u2019s Pittsburgh office could experience a striking return to Pittsburgh\u2019s industrial roots when a group of about 90 analysts will hold an election to decide whether to form a union with the United Steelworkers (USW). The workers, who are employed by the Indian outsourcing firm HCL America but work on Google projects at Google\u2019s offices, are just a tiny fraction of the legions of temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs) who make up an enormous \u201cshadow\u201d workforce at Google, outnumbering direct Google employees approximately 135,000 to 115,000. If their campaign is successful, they will become what is believed to be the first group of professional tech workers to unionize in the US since a wave of workplace activism began to roil the industry in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. In some ways, these workers are marginal to the broader tech industry. They live and work far from its center of gravity in Silicon Valley, and their actual employer is not exactly a household name. But they also sit at the center of urgent questions about the future of a tech-driven economy. Pittsburgh, the quintessential post-industrial city that lost half its population after the US steel industry collapsed in the 1980s, has enjoyed a tech-fueled renaissance in recent years as major companies including Google, Uber, Apple and Facebook opened offices there. The benefits of that economic rebirth have been distributed unevenly, community activists say, in part due to the industry\u2019s reliance on huge numbers of contractors \u2013 from Uber drivers to Google\u2019s TVCs \u2013 and preference to offer direct employment to as few people as possible. But as much as the tech industry has transformed Pittsburgh, it\u2019s possible that Pittsburgh could transform the tech industry. After all, this is the city that gave birth to both the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which eventually merged to form the AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s largest federation of unions, as well as the USW. That a campaign to challenge the severe power imbalance between subcontracted tech workers and one of the most powerful corporations in the world should emerge here is only in keeping with historical precedent. \u201cIn the 1930s, our union was created when there was a small group of workers who said, \u2018No more,\u2019\u201d said Maria Somma, the organizing director for the USW. \u201cIt was when they were courageous enough to do that that it allowed the rest of the sector to unionize.\u201d Somma joined the USW from a nurse\u2019s union 18 years ago, when the USW set its sights on organizing workers from new industries, including healthcare, education and, now, tech. At her office in the USW\u2019s downtown Pittsburgh headquarters, a large poster celebrates the union\u2019s recent success in organizing the 300 librarians and other staff of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh system with the slogan, \u201cHahahaha, suck it Andrew Carnegie! We won!\u201d beside a crossed-out photo of the 19th-century steel magnate\u2019s face. \u201cThe HCL workers are the first group that\u2019s daring enough \u2013 understanding the precarity of their situation \u2013 to say we\u2019ve got to take a step,\u201d she said. \u201cThat to me is unbelievably brave. You want to see working-class heroes in today\u2019s modern world, look at them.\u201d A history of workers fighting back In Pittsburgh, technology and labor have always been inextricably linked. It was the Bessemer converter \u2013 a furnace used to create steel in what\u2019s known as the Bessemer process \u2013 and other technological innovations that revolutionized the steel industry, turning Carnegie\u2019s Homestead steel mill, located just a few miles upriver from Pittsburgh, into a kind of late-19th-century Google, with the most advanced tech creating the most extraordinary wealth, as well as severe inequality and labor strife. Homestead was \u201cthe most modern mill in the country\u201d, explained Rosemary Trump, a retired labor leader, on a recent trip to the historic site. The mill itself no longer exists, shuttered in 1986 along with most of the other steel mills that once lined the Monongahela River and replaced with a shopping mall and housing development. But the red-brick pump house, which once supplied the factory with water from the river, still stands as a monument to the bloody history of the 1892 Homestead strike, in which thousands of striking workers faced off with hundreds of Pinkerton agents (a private police force used by industrialist to control workers) sent to take control of the mill by Carnegie\u2019s agent, Henry Clay Frick. The resulting gun battle left seven strikers and three Pinkertons dead. The Battle of Homestead was the result of \u201ca radical transformation of technology that completely changed the relationship between workers and owners\u201d, said Charlie McCollester, a retired labor activist and historian. Before the invention of the Bessemer process, a small group of highly skilled workers known as puddlers were essential to the process of turning iron into steel. After Henry Bessemer\u2019s innovation, McCollester explained, \u201cThe equipment was in charge. The workers became \u2018hands\u2019 and had much less control.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, productivity exploded, with mills going from producing 100 pounds of steel at a time to 100 tons. \u201cWe see an analogy with IT for young people,\u201d McCollester said as we drove through Homestead. The town\u2019s economic recovery is evident, though shaky; on one street we pass a crumbling former municipal building where the labor leader Mary Harris \u201cMother\u201d Jones was jailed for supporting a strike in 1919, as well as an imposing old bank building that was recently converted into a recreational axe-throwing gym. \u201cWe are facing as much of a shift now.\u201d Indeed, the HCL contractors are perfect examples of how technology is affecting not just blue-collar workers but professionals as well.

Low pay, stingy time off, a lack of responsiveness from management and a constant sense of precarity were common concerns among the HCL workers who spoke to the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that from one Monday to the next we will have a job,\u201d said Josh Borden, who has worked for HCL for three and a half years. \u201cIt feels like being on the edge of a cliff all the time.\u201d \u201cFrom the time I was hired until now, me and my colleagues have been asking for certain things, like a couple extra vacation days, a better healthcare plan, more pay sometimes,\u201d said another HCL worker, Johanne Rokholt. \u201cThe answer is always, \u2018We\u2019re doing as much as we can \u2026 You are lucky and you should feel grateful.\u2019 It\u2019s a one-sided conversation and I would like to see it be a dialogue.\u201d Several of the HCL contractors also expressed frustration with the two-tiered system that allows them to work on Google projects with Google employees in Google\u2019s offices, but doesn\u2019t provide them with the pay or security that direct employees earn. \u201cI\u2019ve been here five years,\u201d said Gabrielle Norton-Moore, who has been at Google Pittsburgh since before HCL got its contract there and says she often feels like a \u201cpeasant\u201d at work. \u201cI\u2019ve put in the loyalty and the time and the energy and everything, and it\u2019s just like, there\u2019s no reward at the end of the tunnel.\u201d The union effort is being closely watched by Googlers, many of whom have participated in their own workplace activism in recent years, including the November 2018 walkout over the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment. A Google software engineer who has worked in the Pittsburgh office for nearly 10 years, Todd Derr, said that he \u201cfully supports\u201d the unionization effort. \u201cI consider everyone who works in the office (and the whole company) to be co-workers, regardless of who technically employs them.\u201d When the HCL workers went public with their union drive, some Googlers published a letter of support and compiled a slide deck of memes with messages of support. After HCL began an anti-union campaign, Googlers published a petition calling on Google to sign a \u201cneutrality agreement\u201d, urging them to condemn the \u201cuse of union-busting consultants\u201d by HCL. \u201cGoogle must commit to a fair election, free of interference, and oppose unfair interference by their business partner, HCL,\u201d one of the Googlers involved with the petition told the Guardian. \u201cThey must commit to maintain their contract with HCL, without regard for whether or not those employees vote to unionize.\u201d Jenn Kaiser, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement: \u201cWe work with lots of partners, many of which have unionized workforces, and many of which don\u2019t. As with all our partners, whether HCL\u2019s employees unionize or not is between them and their employer.\u201d Meenakshi Benjwal, HCL\u2019s head of external communications, said in a statement: \u201cWe respect our employees legal right to decide whether or not they want to be represented by a union and are dedicated to fostering an inclusive and open office culture for all of our team members at HCL.\u201d The Pittsburgh Googler who spoke on condition of anonymity said that she was excited by the union drive. \u201cI understand in the case of something like restaurant services or custodial services why [Google would use] a separate contracting company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for me to understand why there\u2019s a separate contracting company for people who are helping build our core business, which is software.\u201d \u201cPittsburgh\u2019s the right city for it,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re an industrial city and there\u2019s a whole history of unionization here \u2026 Pittsburgh is positioning itself for moving from the steel industry to more of the tech industry and medical industry. I think it\u2019s really appropriate that some of the other ethos of Pittsburgh moves with it.\u201d Indeed, according to Somma, some Google employees have already gotten in touch with the USW. \u201cThere\u2019s been a few,\u201d Somma said. \u201cGoogle employees \u2013 they\u2019re self-organizing, they\u2019re walking out based on social issues, so they understand their power. They\u2019re walking out to send a message to Google. But they\u2019re doing it for others. Now the question is: are they willing to do it for themselves?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In a secluded room in the Guardian offices, Julian Clary is letting me have a look at his ring. Oh, do behave, readers \u2013 it\u2019s his wedding ring: black, ceramic, studded with a diamond and, as he gleefully points out, rather S&amp;M-looking.</p> <p>He wed his longtime partner, Ian Mackley, in 2016, although he is not here today to talk about that. The last time he did, telling Attitude magazine that he wasn\u2019t sure if he liked married life, he got into heaps of trouble. \u201cYes, I did! So now my mind is always going: \u2018Don\u2019t say anything too harsh!\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cAll I can say, really, is that I\u2019m highly amused by being married.\u201d</p> <p>But there aren\u2019t many subjects that are off-limits for Clary. He rose to fame in the 80s as an outrageously camp comic decked out in garish PVC who shocked audiences with his innuendo-packed gags about gay sex. He sent his career into a tailspin at the 1993 British Comedy awards by telling the audience: \u201cI\u2019ve just been fisting Norman Lamont.\u201d (The then chancellor was in the audience with his wife, Rosemary, and the tabloids had a field day.) And Clary\u2019s 2005 autobiography, A Young Man\u2019s Passage, could teach most millennials a thing or two about the art of oversharing, what with its inclusion of embarrassing ailments and graphic ejaculation scenes.</p> <p>At 60 years of age, Clary is still touring \u2013 his Born to Mince tour has just been extended \u2013 although he says it may be his last time around the circuit. \u201cAlthough I do always say that, rather lamely,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut can you go on doing buggery jokes into your 70s and 80s? I don\u2019t want to be one of those comedians who plays to ever-dwindling audiences. I met Danny La Rue in Australia once and he was doing a tour of care homes. I did think: \u2018Fuck me, does it come to that in the end?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0beb74bca11965781e73643119892cc4f5e2e615\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0beb74bca11965781e73643119892cc4f5e2e615/211_0_4406_4404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clary in 1989 on his TV show Trick or Treat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clary in 1989 on his TV show Trick or Treat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, Clary doesn\u2019t trade so much in shock these days. There\u2019s an element of the unknown to his shows, thanks to his fondness for audience interaction \u2013 \u201cthey might be drunk, they might be mad\u201d \u2013 but in general his shows have become cosy, affectionate affairs, full of people who have been coming to see him for decades; some of whom now bring their grownup kids along. This time, he has included a section called \u201cheterosexual aversion therapy\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse to get four straight men on stage and attach wires to their genitals. It\u2019s a bit of nonsense, really.\u201d But it\u2019s nonsense with a political edge if you\u2019re looking for it.</p> <p>When Clary first started out in comedy, he used to ditch any jokes that could potentially be deemed to have a political element: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be preachy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit camp, really. Camp needs to be trivial by its very nature.\u201d And yet simply by being who he was \u2013 an overtly effeminate male on mainstream TV, talking about \u201cshiny helmets\u201d and \u201cjuicy saveloys\u201d, he was hugely political. His first reviews prompted plenty of \u201cGet This Poof Off Our Screens!\u201d headlines: \u201cThings the Daily Mail wouldn\u2019t even print now,\u201d he notes. How did that feel at the time? \u201cOh, I loved it! It\u2019s just the reaction I would have wanted from them.\u201d</p> <p>By that time, Clary had had plenty of practice when it came to outraging straight society. Raised in the middle-class suburb of Teddington in south-west London, he surprised his family by winning a scholarship at St Benedict\u2019s, a Catholic private school in nearby Ealing. It was there he endured beatings from priests (something that wiped out his young religious fervour) and much bullying from peers for his effeminate mannerisms \u2013 something he gleefully played up to with his best (and only) friend, Nicholas Reader.</p> <p>\u201cWe found a way to turn it all into a performance,\u201d he says. \u201cJust mincing around, really, to escape from it into an imaginary world. Because we thought, well, this may be where we\u2019re stuck now, but we will do something with our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Their friendship endured throughout Clary\u2019s fame, and so it is upsetting to hear that Reader died in June, especially as Clary\u2019s eyes well up a little when mentioning him. He says he has a ritual before he goes on stage each night: a little conversation with friends who are no longer here. \u201cNow Nick has been added, and Auntie Tess, too,\u201d he says. \u201cI noticed on the last tour that I\u2019d started to think: \u2018Well, I wonder who will be in today?\u2019 And then you see all these little faces leering down at you.\u201d</p> <p>Clary says he has been thinking about Reader\u2019s influence on him a lot since he died: how they helped each other get through school, and how Reader probably shaped his comedy career. \u201cBecause we did escape through comedy, the usefulness of laughing at things that aren\u2019t actually nice. I was very shy [before they met] and quite effeminate, but the whole Quentin Crisp thing we adopted when we were together; that came from Nick, really.\u201d</p> <p>After school, Clary worked the cabaret circuit (along with a stint as a singing telegram), noticing a gap in the market for male glamour and escapism, and, after getting his TV break on Saturday Live in 1987, his fame swiftly soared. At about the same time, he became a regular at the \u201csordid little clubs\u201d in Soho, although it\u2019s a time he recalls with a sadness: \u201cBecause people kept disappearing.\u201d During the Aids crisis, Clary says the attitude within the gay community was basically: \u201c\u2018Everything\u2019s fucked, so we may as well party.\u2019 And so you would carry on \u2013 you\u2019d go out and be gayer than ever, really.\u201d</p> <p>His parents were unaware of how reckless he was being, and so, he says, was he. \u201cBecause, compared with everyone else, I wasn\u2019t being reckless. It was just normal. And today, people are still just as reckless. I wasn\u2019t taking crystal meth and going to sex parties for the entire weekend.\u201d</p> <p>Although he recalls it with some embarrassment, he thinks a nasty case of anal warts probably saved him from contracting HIV. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you realise in retrospect, where you think \u2013 gosh, maybe there is a God after all?\u201d he laughs. \u201cBecause I was very keen on it \u2026 and then I got the warts, and I was so mortified I wouldn\u2019t let anyone investigate that orifice for quite some time.\u201d</p> <p>Fate was less kind to others, including Clary\u2019s boyfriend, Christopher, who died in 1991. In his autobiography, Clary writes beautifully \u2013 and brutally \u2013 about caring for him in his final days: cleaning up the fleshy lumps his lover was hacking up; taking him on ill-advised holidays in the sun. When he died, Clary put a circle of flowers around his face and asked the hospital to leave him lying in state for three hours: \u201cI wanted three days, but I knew there was a queue for that room,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>He still has the notes Christopher wrote to him from hospital, and came across them recently: \u201cIt was upsetting,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause you\u2019re back in that moment, in the hospital. It\u2019s quite nice to remember happier times generally when I think of him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1eecbf0f33e42b315c69db8eb030bc32757cf061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eecbf0f33e42b315c69db8eb030bc32757cf061/30_586_4671_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clary in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clary in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darryn Lyons/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clary was still grieving, taking on far too much work, and was pumped full of Valium when he delivered his infamous Normal Lamont gag. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good joke, and I stand by it,\u201d he says now, slightly miffed that people remember the fisting part and not the punchline: \u201cTalk about a red box\u201d was largely drowned out by uproarious laughter. He didn\u2019t enjoy the backlash \u2013 \u201cyou become a comedian because you want to be popular\u201d \u2013 but thinks, as with the warts, it may have been another unlikely case of divine intervention. \u201cI like to think he made me say something outrageous in order to clear my diary and give me some time off. Television was never my forte. It\u2019s probably just as well that I stayed out of it.\u201d</p> <p>In some ways you can view Clary \u2013 who faced calls that he should be banned from television \u2013 as an early victim of \u201ccancel culture\u201d, although it was the right wing that Clary had offended: \u201cAnd I always felt that if you\u2019d outraged the Daily Mail then it was job done, really.\u201d So what does he think about today\u2019s comedy climate, where offending liberal sensibilities can cause you to be persona non grata?</p> <p>\u201cIf you start worrying about that, then it\u2019s all over,\u201d he says. \u201cYou end up with very safe, insincere comedy. That\u2019s where alternative comedy started \u2013 as a reaction to that.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a new prudishness going on that is stifling comedy \u2013 concepts such as LGBT venues being safe spaces, or comedians thinking long and hard about who their targets should be, are things he\u2019s fully onboard with: \u201cI quite understand things like safe spaces and refusing to engage because life\u2019s too short. I get that.\u201d</p> <p>Would he have appreciated safe-space venues in the 80s? \u201cWell, no,\u201d he laughs. \u201cPeople think of that time as the dark ages. It wasn\u2019t, but it was a bit grim. But I didn\u2019t really play the gay circuit \u2013 I needed heterosexuals to pick on.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve got these mannerisms, this voice and all the things that could be a problem in life. So I decided to emphasise them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Does he ever worry about jokes that could be deemed to stereotype gay people? \u201cNo, because I don\u2019t ever think of myself as a stereotype. I have the right to be a camp, effeminate homosexual.\u201d He remembers going on highly politicised Pride marches in the 1980s. \u201cBack when it was all chants and whistles. We would be quite cross, as opposed to the commercial celebration thing it is now, which is also great.\u201d</p> <p>He attended Pride this year, although it was \u2013 to paraphrase Withnail \u2013 by mistake (he was going elsewhere, but got caught up in things). He found himself shocked by just how debauched it all was. \u201cIt was a bit scary, the number of people and the \u2026\u201d he adopts a reaching-for-the-smelling-salts voice \u2013 \u201c<em>levels of intoxication</em>. I was worried for people \u2013 how are you going to get home? Where will you go to the toilet? I came over all paternal, much to my surprise.\u201d</p> <p>Clary says the recent embracing of sexual fluidity and non-binary identities is a great evolvement: \u201cWhy not? We are all on sliding scales and there\u2019s no reason why that shouldn\u2019t move around. I know people get very worked up about it, but speak to teenagers and they\u2019re perfectly accepting of it all. People come out really young now; they can change their minds, and no one screams. It\u2019s a very good omen for the future.\u201d Indeed, even this self-styled \u201crenowned homosexual\u201d thinks such labels would have been helpful to him during his own sexual awakening. He embarked on a heterosexual affair while he was a student at Goldsmiths, University of London. \u201cI was terribly good at heterosexual sex, I quite mastered it,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut obviously emotionally, and in other ways, it wasn\u2019t what I needed.\u201d</p> <p>Clary seems to enjoy his current life half out of the spotlight more than he did his peak fame years. Along with his tour, he has the \u201cunexpected joy in my life\u201d that is writing children\u2019s fiction \u2013 earlier this year, the fifth of his The Bolds series was published. The books are based on a story about the neighbours Clary made up himself as an eight-year-old boy \u2013 about a family of hyenas who have disguised themselves as humans and live in Teddington.</p> <p>\u201cI just regress to being a child when I write them,\u201d he says. Clary has just written a stage version, too, and the experience is so rewarding that it has put him off the idea of writing the next volume of his autobiography. (The first one only went up to 1993.) \u201cI\u2019m contemplating whether I can really face that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to write a children\u2019s book \u2013 25,000 words, thank you, goodbye. You don\u2019t have to bare your soul.\u201d</p> <p>So what, after several decades of fame, does Clary think his legacy is? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I think the way he brought the gay experience into people\u2019s living rooms, at a time when it was seen as something unpalatable by much of the press and public, must count for something. \u201cDemystifying gay sex \u2026 yes, I\u2019ll take that,\u201d he muses. \u201cSpecifically anal intercourse, because people just cannot cope with that, in all sorts of cultures.\u201d He smiles: \u201cIt\u2019s a very strange legacy, isn\u2019t it? But I did design it. I\u2019ve got these mannerisms and this voice and all the things that could be a problem in life. So I decided to emphasise them all the more.

      "bodyText": "In a secluded room in the Guardian offices, Julian Clary is letting me have a look at his ring. Oh, do behave, readers \u2013 it\u2019s his wedding ring: black, ceramic, studded with a diamond and, as he gleefully points out, rather S&amp;M-looking. He wed his longtime partner, Ian Mackley, in 2016, although he is not here today to talk about that. The last time he did, telling Attitude magazine that he wasn\u2019t sure if he liked married life, he got into heaps of trouble. \u201cYes, I did! So now my mind is always going: \u2018Don\u2019t say anything too harsh!\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cAll I can say, really, is that I\u2019m highly amused by being married.\u201d But there aren\u2019t many subjects that are off-limits for Clary. He rose to fame in the 80s as an outrageously camp comic decked out in garish PVC who shocked audiences with his innuendo-packed gags about gay sex. He sent his career into a tailspin at the 1993 British Comedy awards by telling the audience: \u201cI\u2019ve just been fisting Norman Lamont.\u201d (The then chancellor was in the audience with his wife, Rosemary, and the tabloids had a field day.) And Clary\u2019s 2005 autobiography, A Young Man\u2019s Passage, could teach most millennials a thing or two about the art of oversharing, what with its inclusion of embarrassing ailments and graphic ejaculation scenes. At 60 years of age, Clary is still touring \u2013 his Born to Mince tour has just been extended \u2013 although he says it may be his last time around the circuit. \u201cAlthough I do always say that, rather lamely,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut can you go on doing buggery jokes into your 70s and 80s? I don\u2019t want to be one of those comedians who plays to ever-dwindling audiences. I met Danny La Rue in Australia once and he was doing a tour of care homes. I did think: \u2018Fuck me, does it come to that in the end?\u2019\u201d Of course, Clary doesn\u2019t trade so much in shock these days. There\u2019s an element of the unknown to his shows, thanks to his fondness for audience interaction \u2013 \u201cthey might be drunk, they might be mad\u201d \u2013 but in general his shows have become cosy, affectionate affairs, full of people who have been coming to see him for decades; some of whom now bring their grownup kids along. This time, he has included a section called \u201cheterosexual aversion therapy\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse to get four straight men on stage and attach wires to their genitals. It\u2019s a bit of nonsense, really.\u201d But it\u2019s nonsense with a political edge if you\u2019re looking for it. When Clary first started out in comedy, he used to ditch any jokes that could potentially be deemed to have a political element: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be preachy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit camp, really. Camp needs to be trivial by its very nature.\u201d And yet simply by being who he was \u2013 an overtly effeminate male on mainstream TV, talking about \u201cshiny helmets\u201d and \u201cjuicy saveloys\u201d, he was hugely political. His first reviews prompted plenty of \u201cGet This Poof Off Our Screens!\u201d headlines: \u201cThings the Daily Mail wouldn\u2019t even print now,\u201d he notes. How did that feel at the time? \u201cOh, I loved it! It\u2019s just the reaction I would have wanted from them.\u201d By that time, Clary had had plenty of practice when it came to outraging straight society. Raised in the middle-class suburb of Teddington in south-west London, he surprised his family by winning a scholarship at St Benedict\u2019s, a Catholic private school in nearby Ealing. It was there he endured beatings from priests (something that wiped out his young religious fervour) and much bullying from peers for his effeminate mannerisms \u2013 something he gleefully played up to with his best (and only) friend, Nicholas Reader. \u201cWe found a way to turn it all into a performance,\u201d he says. \u201cJust mincing around, really, to escape from it into an imaginary world. Because we thought, well, this may be where we\u2019re stuck now, but we will do something with our lives.\u201d Their friendship endured throughout Clary\u2019s fame, and so it is upsetting to hear that Reader died in June, especially as Clary\u2019s eyes well up a little when mentioning him. He says he has a ritual before he goes on stage each night: a little conversation with friends who are no longer here. \u201cNow Nick has been added, and Auntie Tess, too,\u201d he says. \u201cI noticed on the last tour that I\u2019d started to think: \u2018Well, I wonder who will be in today?\u2019 And then you see all these little faces leering down at you.\u201d Clary says he has been thinking about Reader\u2019s influence on him a lot since he died: how they helped each other get through school, and how Reader probably shaped his comedy career. \u201cBecause we did escape through comedy, the usefulness of laughing at things that aren\u2019t actually nice.

      "body": "<p>In November of 2005, Jana Hunter released a collection of songs recorded almost entirely alone over a decade, titled Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom. It was Hunter\u2019s first solo album after years of collaborating with the 2000s freak-folk mainstay Devendra Banhart. The album contained short songs (mostly hovering around the two-minute mark) that were haunting and wistful, with muddled vocals and warped instrumentation, and earned Hunter glowing reviews and a proper spot in the then blossoming world of blog-approved indie music.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/18/tegan-and-sara-people-never-talk-about-women-and-drug-use-positively\">Tegan and Sara: \u2018People never talk about women and drug use positively\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom ends with an exclamation point, a surprising stylistic shift in the form of a pop song called K, which is based around a video game-like electronic loop, interwoven with ghostly vocal \u201cahs\u201d and twangs of guitar. The lyrics are a blend of mundane lightness and hints at darkness: \u201cI\u2019d love to see you Saturday afternoon / I\u2019d spin you out and show you what you\u2019re worth / I\u2019d love to hold your backbone in my hands / I\u2019d be your favorite cartoon.\u201d The song now feels prescient, a glimpse of the themes and sounds that permeate The Competition, the fourth album from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/26/lower-dens-escape-from-evil-review\">Lower Dens</a>, Hunter\u2019s band with drummer Nate Nelson, which formed in 2009.</p> <p>While on the surface, Hunter\u2019s early songs may appear to be more intimate and confessional by nature of their genre\u2019s styling, he says the pop songs on The Competition are his most honest yet. \u201cI spent most of my life hiding from myself,\u201d said Hunter, on the phone from Los Angeles, where he moved from Baltimore on Thanksgiving day in 2018 (though he still spends a lot of time there). \u201cI\u2019ve tried to limit myself\u201d with past albums, Hunter said. I wanted to push myself to write songs that felt a little less restrictive.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter is more nervous about releasing this album than he ever has been with anything before. \u201cI wanted to risk more vulnerability. I feel like I got to that place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c3d7f1769e75b30a3d48ae1dabc73b381823d24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3d7f1769e75b30a3d48ae1dabc73b381823d24/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunter in the video for the song I Drive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunter in the video for the song I Drive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Torso</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hunter was assigned female at birth. In <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/a38918/jana-hunter-lower-dens-essay/\">a 2015 essay for Cosmopolitan</a>, he described telling his parents he was a boy when he was three or four years old, the fifth child in a family of eight kids, and their dismissal of it: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that I realized there was more to that conversation than my childish fancy.\u201d He identifies as transmasculine, which he explains as identifying more as a man on some days and more as a woman on others. \u201cIt\u2019s not more toward one side of the binary or the other.\u201d</p> <p>The Competition was mostly written over a period of three years, in bursts of inspiration and creativity that were bordered by difficult periods that necessitated breaks from music to cope with mental health issues. For him, transitioning was bound up in those issues. \u201cWhen I was a kid I did express my gender identity and it didn\u2019t go over very well,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThat stuff has colored my whole life.\u201d</p> <p>The album also interweaves his personal experiences with politics. (The press release calls it \u201ca pop album that is politically urgent\u201d.) Hunter says writing the first single, Young Republicans, \u201cfelt politically risky\u201d. In the video for the song, directed by Raul Gonzo, Hunter acts as a narrator, singing in a glittering black bomber jacket as a bleak, Twin Peaks-esque montage plays out. A blond woman suns herself while glaring at detectives investigating a crime. A man in a white tennis outfit glares at a woman repairing his television. The whole thing ends with a group of preppy people in red suits pledging to the American flag before feasting on Hunter, who is lying face-up on a dining table with his torso sliced open. He used to follow the news closely but had to take a break in the Trump era, so he follows journalists he respects instead: \u201cAnd I worry that they\u2019re just losing their minds.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0xIaRaFvV8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D0xIaRaFvV8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The video for Young Republicans, a song Hunter said \u2018felt politically risky\u2019.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The song sounds like a crisp 80s dance pop hit, with all the requisite electronic synths, bleeps and bloops, but with an eeriness that\u2019s unsettling, lyrics about people who \u201cjust don\u2019t fit in\u201d and a world that\u2019s burning.

      "bodyText": "In November of 2005, Jana Hunter released a collection of songs recorded almost entirely alone over a decade, titled Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom. It was Hunter\u2019s first solo album after years of collaborating with the 2000s freak-folk mainstay Devendra Banhart. The album contained short songs (mostly hovering around the two-minute mark) that were haunting and wistful, with muddled vocals and warped instrumentation, and earned Hunter glowing reviews and a proper spot in the then blossoming world of blog-approved indie music. Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom ends with an exclamation point, a surprising stylistic shift in the form of a pop song called K, which is based around a video game-like electronic loop, interwoven with ghostly vocal \u201cahs\u201d and twangs of guitar. The lyrics are a blend of mundane lightness and hints at darkness: \u201cI\u2019d love to see you Saturday afternoon / I\u2019d spin you out and show you what you\u2019re worth / I\u2019d love to hold your backbone in my hands / I\u2019d be your favorite cartoon.\u201d The song now feels prescient, a glimpse of the themes and sounds that permeate The Competition, the fourth album from Lower Dens, Hunter\u2019s band with drummer Nate Nelson, which formed in 2009. While on the surface, Hunter\u2019s early songs may appear to be more intimate and confessional by nature of their genre\u2019s styling, he says the pop songs on The Competition are his most honest yet. \u201cI spent most of my life hiding from myself,\u201d said Hunter, on the phone from Los Angeles, where he moved from Baltimore on Thanksgiving day in 2018 (though he still spends a lot of time there). \u201cI\u2019ve tried to limit myself\u201d with past albums, Hunter said. I wanted to push myself to write songs that felt a little less restrictive.\u201d Hunter is more nervous about releasing this album than he ever has been with anything before. \u201cI wanted to risk more vulnerability. I feel like I got to that place.\u201d Hunter was assigned female at birth. In a 2015 essay for Cosmopolitan, he described telling his parents he was a boy when he was three or four years old, the fifth child in a family of eight kids, and their dismissal of it: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that I realized there was more to that conversation than my childish fancy.\u201d He identifies as transmasculine, which he explains as identifying more as a man on some days and more as a woman on others. \u201cIt\u2019s not more toward one side of the binary or the other.\u201d The Competition was mostly written over a period of three years, in bursts of inspiration and creativity that were bordered by difficult periods that necessitated breaks from music to cope with mental health issues. For him, transitioning was bound up in those issues. \u201cWhen I was a kid I did express my gender identity and it didn\u2019t go over very well,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThat stuff has colored my whole life.\u201d The album also interweaves his personal experiences with politics. (The press release calls it \u201ca pop album that is politically urgent\u201d.) Hunter says writing the first single, Young Republicans, \u201cfelt politically risky\u201d. In the video for the song, directed by Raul Gonzo, Hunter acts as a narrator, singing in a glittering black bomber jacket as a bleak, Twin Peaks-esque montage plays out. A blond woman suns herself while glaring at detectives investigating a crime. A man in a white tennis outfit glares at a woman repairing his television. The whole thing ends with a group of preppy people in red suits pledging to the American flag before feasting on Hunter, who is lying face-up on a dining table with his torso sliced open. He used to follow the news closely but had to take a break in the Trump era, so he follows journalists he respects instead: \u201cAnd I worry that they\u2019re just losing their minds.\u201d The song sounds like a crisp 80s dance pop hit, with all the requisite electronic synths, bleeps and bloops, but with an eeriness that\u2019s unsettling, lyrics about people who \u201cjust don\u2019t fit in\u201d and a world that\u2019s burning. Stylistically, the whole album is a giant leap away from the Heirs of Doom era (with the exception of K), and from the first Lower Dens album, 2010\u2019s Twin-Hand Movement (NPR described Lower Dens at the time as \u201ca blissful swarm of feedback\u201d). As a child, Hunter listened to mini-cassettes via headphones with a Fisher-Price Pocket Rocker, escaping into pop songs and a world where he imagined anything was possible. For this album, he says, he wanted to recreate that feeling: \u201cI wanted to write songs that might have the potential to do that.\u201d He says the ideal way to listen to it would be with headphones, to get the feeling of not being in a physical space (whereas his older, more lo-fi recordings could be described as all about physical space, with the echoes and reverb of wherever they were recorded ingrained in the songs). Hunter has experimented with a progression of musical styles over the last 14 years, and The Competition is the latest iteration of that, but thankfully the core elements of his singular songwriting are still always present \u2013 the unusual chord shifts, the serene vocals, the way Hunter invites listeners to settle into a song and become transfixed by it (the best example of this might be the gorgeous song Brains, from their 2012 album Nootropics), the sense of hopefulness that\u2019s always present, even if it\u2019s nearly imperceptible. \u201cI love the textures they use in their production and the songwriting is always heartfelt,\u201d said :3LON (Elon Battle), a Baltimore electronic musician who appears on four songs on The Competition. \u201cI love working with artists that push the boundaries of societal norms.\u201d :3LON lends a vocal complexity to I Drive, a song Hunter says is about feeling rejected by his family, \u201cleaving behind obligations to people who don\u2019t love or care about you, being with and about people who do.

That\u2019s the driving I\u2019m doing.\u201d While Hunter views The Competition as an escape, at the same time he hopes its deeply confessional nature might serve as a beacon for others struggling with their own realities: \u201cAnguish is how we start looking for other people to connect to.\u201d The Competition is out now",

Each sovereign state gets one vote so it is not exactly representative of the world\u2019s population but then again, its votes are not binding on the membership, except in budgetary matters.</p> <p>The general assembly is not nearly as powerful as the security council, which can pass binding resolutions, and is dominated by the five permanent members, the US, China, the UK, France and Russia, who each have a veto.</p> <p>But the general assembly can express world opinion, make recommendations to the security council and elect the council\u2019s non-permanent members. The 74th session takes place this month.</p> <p>The general assembly and the security council are two of six main organs of the UN.

Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year.</p> <p>In truth, the general assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off.</p> <p>For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d1d86581df8b598cacfe7a3d797d8d136154f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d1d86581df8b598cacfe7a3d797d8d136154f8b/0_0_2898_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"speech\" width=\"1000\" height=\"828\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castro and Khrushchev in 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marty Lederhandler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The general assembly is also the preferred venue for America\u2019s great antagonists to land a few blows while on US soil. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/khrushchev-sent-wine-to-irish-diplomat-after-shoe-incident-at-un\">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/21/usa.venezuela\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/23/gaddafi-un-speech\">Muammar </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/23/gaddafi-un-speech\">Gaddafi</a> all had a go at this. Gaddafi unleashed a 90-minute diatribe in 2009 but that was pithy compared to Fidel Castro\u2019s record 269 minutes in 1960.</p> <p>More recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/binyamin-netanyahu-cartoon-bomb-un\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> made headlines in 2012 by bringing visual aids to illustrate his allegations against Iran, one of them a cartoon bomb.</p> <h2>Does anything ever get done at the general assembly?</h2> <p>Good question. It is more about posturing than policy but there are summit meetings on critical subjects. Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/24/nuclear-weapons-un-security-council\">chaired a meeting on nuclear proliferation at his first </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/24/nuclear-weapons-un-security-council\">general assembly in 2009</a>.</p> <p>This year, there is a climate action summit on the eve of the general debate, attended by the teen activist, Greta Thunberg. Putting the climate emergency centre stage and forcing states to do something are two very distinct things, however.</p> <h2>What do New Yorkers make of it?</h2> <p>Not a lot, it has to be said. A large section of east midtown Manhattan is closed to traffic and roads outside the zone are frequently blocked to allow for the motorcades criss-crossing the area. The sidewalks are filled with people in suits with collections of passes around their necks arguing with police about which entrances they can use.</p> <p>It is good news for midtown hoteliers, however. They are booked up months in advance. The power centre during general assembly week used to be the Waldorf Astoria, where the US ambassador\u2019s residence was situated in a penthouse suite. It is also where the US would host many of its meetings in the margins of the general assembly. But the US moved out after the hotel was bought by the Chinese insurance group, Anbang.</p> <p>One visitor tried to break with the routine of luxury hotels. When he attended in 2009, Gadaffi tried to pitch an enormous tent in the town of Bedford, 45 miles north of New York, until the locals complained. The owner of the site said he had no previous knowledge of Gaddafi\u2019s camping intentions. The landlord\u2019s name: Donald Trump.</p> <h2>What should we look for at this year\u2019s general assembly week?</h2> <p>The big question this year, like last year and the year before that, is who is going to meet whom on the sidelines of the assembly. In that way it has the same compelling appeal as a dating show, watching two people who plainly hate each other try to find something in common. This year, like last year, there was some early anticipation of a meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani. That started off unlikely and has veered towards the near impossible following last week\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil installations.</p> <p>Trump and Rouhani both face resistance within their own governments to any form of reconciliation. There would have to be a significant easing of sanctions for Rouhani to agree to a Trump meeting on the sidelines of the general assembly but there are few signs that Trump would be willing to do this.</p> <p>Trump might be keen to spring a surprise encounter, to generate some positive headlines, but that is not how Tehran operates. Rouhani is still being criticised in Iran for taking a phone call from Barack Obama as Rouhani was leaving UNGA in 2013, without checking in first with Iran\u2019s supreme leader.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro was expected to make his UNGA debut, to defend his policies against the near consensus view that they are destroying the Amazon. But his attendance is in doubt in the wake of surgery for a hernia caused by a knife attack during the campaign a year ago. He has vowed to show up, even if confined to a wheelchair. It is a unique opportunity to grab the global spotlight. By an accident of UN history, it is traditional for the Brazilian head of state to be the first world leader to talk at UNGA, on the first morning while everyone is still paying attention. Bolsonaro\u2019s doctors however, may take a different view.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3014e52f3275af8a04f1c6e843f2f3dc4ca7e256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3014e52f3275af8a04f1c6e843f2f3dc4ca7e256/0_132_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani (centre), with and vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri (right) and Ali Akbar Velayati shortly before leaving Tehran for last year\u2019s general assembly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, (centre) with members of his cabinet shortly before leaving Tehran for last year\u2019s general assembly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boris Johnson might welcome his general assembly appearance as a diversion from domestic woes. A second meeting with Trump is likely as both men have an interest in not looking isolated on the world stage. Face time with a US president is always an objective for most visiting leaders, to show their electorates their importance on the world stage.</p> <p>The circumstances of such an encounter can also be important. In 2009, the then UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, was desperate for even a brief meeting with Barack Obama. The meeting finally happened but under humiliating circumstances. Brown got a \u201cwalk and talk\u201d with Obama in the UN kitchens. As Obama strode past the pots and pans and gas ovens, Brown had to try to keep up and talk, out of sight of the world\u2019s cameras.</p> <p>Trump could try to achieve something on his stalled North Korea talks at this general assembly, either some progress with the Pyongyang regime, or a meeting of security council powers, in a bid to fix the holes in sanctions enforcement and put the screws back on.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech is expected to focus on global religious freedom, and he could well refer to the current US priorities at the UN, fighting abortion rights around the world and for a conservative stance on gender issues.</p> <h2>Any no-shows?</h2> <p>Some leaders might not bother with the general assembly at all. Vladimir Putin is a regular no-show. The Russian president tends to come only once a decade and the last time was in 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=true&amp;title=Finding%20a%20permanent%20home&amp;description=Before%20it%20established%20a%20permanent%20home%2C%20the%20general%20assembly%20moved%20around%20and%20held%20its%20first%20session%20with%2051%20states%20represented%2C%20in%20postwar%20London%2C%20in%20the%20Methodist%20Central%20Hall%2C%20in%20January%201946.%20A%20British%20diplomat%2C%20Gladwyn%20Jebb%2C%20was%20acting%20secretary%20general%20until%20the%20appointment%20of%20Trygve%20Lie%2C%20a%20Norwegian.%0A%0AIn%201951%2C%20the%20UN%20opened%20its%20headquarters%20in%20Turtle%20Bay%2C%20New%20York%20City%20and%20a%20permanent%20home%20was%20found%20for%20meetings%20of%20the%20general%20assembly.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Finding a permanent home sidebar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=true&title=Finding%20a%20permanent%20home&description=Before%20it%20established%20a%20permanent%20home%2C%20the%20general%20assembly%20moved%20around%20and%20held%20its%20first%20session%20with%2051%20states%20represented%2C%20in%20postwar%20London%2C%20in%20the%20Methodist%20Central%20Hall%2C%20in%20January%201946.%20A%20British%20diplomat%2C%20Gladwyn%20Jebb%2C%20was%20acting%20secretary%20general%20until%20the%20appointment%20of%20Trygve%20Lie%2C%20a%20Norwegian.%0A%0AIn%201951%2C%20the%20UN%20opened%20its%20headquarters%20in%20Turtle%20Bay%2C%20New%20York%20City%20and%20a%20permanent%20home%20was%20found%20for%20meetings%20of%20the%20general%20assembly.&link=false\">Finding a permanent home sidebar</a> </figure>  <p>A bigger question is whether Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, will turn up. He came at the last moment in 2018, but this year, with the US and its allies no longer recognising him as head of state and accusing his regime of numerous crimes, his presence in New York, even as the theoretically protected guest of the UN, would be a much more risky endeavour.</p> <h2>Who runs the general assembly?</h2> <p>Although it is the UN secretary general who gets the limelight for most of the year, the event gives the president of the general assembly, elected each year by the member states ahead of general debate, a chance to shine.</p> <p>This year it is Nigeria\u2019s Tijjani Muhammad-Bande. After the initial excitement of greeting the world leaders, however, it is rather a thankless task, introducing each leader to the assembly and then sitting through one speech after another, most of them turgid and self-congratulatory.</p> <h2>What about the sideshows?</h2> <p>This is the world\u2019s biggest summit and it attracts a lot of side events because of the proximity and potential participation of world leaders. The most glittering of these events is the Goalkeepers conference run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where celebrities, activists and politicians will talkbout global inequality.</p> <h2>Further reading</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/27345/take-the-u-n-general-assembly-seriously-but-don-t-expect-results\">Take the U</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/27345/take-the-u-n-general-assembly-seriously-but-don-t-expect-results\">N</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/27345/take-the-u-n-general-assembly-seriously-but-don-t-expect-results\"> general assembly seriously \u2013 but don\u2019t expect results</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/27345/take-the-u-n-general-assembly-seriously-but-don-t-expect-results\"> World Politics Review</a></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/samantha-power-former-us-ambassador-un-interview\">The Education of an Idealist</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/samantha-power-former-us-ambassador-un-interview\"> Samantha Power</a></p></li> </ul>",

The only time the world really pays heed to its great talking shop is the week commencing 23 September, when the high-level general debate takes place at its customary moment in the annual diplomatic calendar. The world\u2019s leaders converge on New York, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium and orate in front of the world. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year. In truth, the general assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off. For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries. The general assembly is also the preferred venue for America\u2019s great antagonists to land a few blows while on US soil. Nikita Khrushchev, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Muammar Gaddafi all had a go at this. Gaddafi unleashed a 90-minute diatribe in 2009 but that was pithy compared to Fidel Castro\u2019s record 269 minutes in 1960. More recently, Binyamin Netanyahu made headlines in 2012 by bringing visual aids to illustrate his allegations against Iran, one of them a cartoon bomb. Does anything ever get done at the general assembly? Good question. It is more about posturing than policy but there are summit meetings on critical subjects. Barack Obama chaired a meeting on nuclear proliferation at his first general assembly in 2009. This year, there is a climate action summit on the eve of the general debate, attended by the teen activist, Greta Thunberg. Putting the climate emergency centre stage and forcing states to do something are two very distinct things, however. What do New Yorkers make of it? Not a lot, it has to be said. A large section of east midtown Manhattan is closed to traffic and roads outside the zone are frequently blocked to allow for the motorcades criss-crossing the area. The sidewalks are filled with people in suits with collections of passes around their necks arguing with police about which entrances they can use. It is good news for midtown hoteliers, however. They are booked up months in advance. The power centre during general assembly week used to be the Waldorf Astoria, where the US ambassador\u2019s residence was situated in a penthouse suite. It is also where the US would host many of its meetings in the margins of the general assembly. But the US moved out after the hotel was bought by the Chinese insurance group, Anbang. One visitor tried to break with the routine of luxury hotels. When he attended in 2009, Gadaffi tried to pitch an enormous tent in the town of Bedford, 45 miles north of New York, until the locals complained. The owner of the site said he had no previous knowledge of Gaddafi\u2019s camping intentions. The landlord\u2019s name: Donald Trump. What should we look for at this year\u2019s general assembly week? The big question this year, like last year and the year before that, is who is going to meet whom on the sidelines of the assembly. In that way it has the same compelling appeal as a dating show, watching two people who plainly hate each other try to find something in common. This year, like last year, there was some early anticipation of a meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani. That started off unlikely and has veered towards the near impossible following last week\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil installations. Trump and Rouhani both face resistance within their own governments to any form of reconciliation. There would have to be a significant easing of sanctions for Rouhani to agree to a Trump meeting on the sidelines of the general assembly but there are few signs that Trump would be willing to do this. Trump might be keen to spring a surprise encounter, to generate some positive headlines, but that is not how Tehran operates. Rouhani is still being criticised in Iran for taking a phone call from Barack Obama as Rouhani was leaving UNGA in 2013, without checking in first with Iran\u2019s supreme leader. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro was expected to make his UNGA debut, to defend his policies against the near consensus view that they are destroying the Amazon. But his attendance is in doubt in the wake of surgery for a hernia caused by a knife attack during the campaign a year ago. He has vowed to show up, even if confined to a wheelchair. It is a unique opportunity to grab the global spotlight. By an accident of UN history, it is traditional for the Brazilian head of state to be the first world leader to talk at UNGA, on the first morning while everyone is still paying attention. Bolsonaro\u2019s doctors however, may take a different view. Boris Johnson might welcome his general assembly appearance as a diversion from domestic woes. A second meeting with Trump is likely as both men have an interest in not looking isolated on the world stage. Face time with a US president is always an objective for most visiting leaders, to show their electorates their importance on the world stage. The circumstances of such an encounter can also be important. In 2009, the then UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, was desperate for even a brief meeting with Barack Obama. The meeting finally happened but under humiliating circumstances. Brown got a \u201cwalk and talk\u201d with Obama in the UN kitchens. As Obama strode past the pots and pans and gas ovens, Brown had to try to keep up and talk, out of sight of the world\u2019s cameras. Trump could try to achieve something on his stalled North Korea talks at this general assembly, either some progress with the Pyongyang regime, or a meeting of security council powers, in a bid to fix the holes in sanctions enforcement and put the screws back on. Trump\u2019s speech is expected to focus on global religious freedom, and he could well refer to the current US priorities at the UN, fighting abortion rights around the world and for a conservative stance on gender issues. Any no-shows? Some leaders might not bother with the general assembly at all. Vladimir Putin is a regular no-show. The Russian president tends to come only once a decade and the last time was in 2015. A bigger question is whether Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, will turn up. He came at the last moment in 2018, but this year, with the US and its allies no longer recognising him as head of state and accusing his regime of numerous crimes, his presence in New York, even as the theoretically protected guest of the UN, would be a much more risky endeavour. Who runs the general assembly? Although it is the UN secretary general who gets the limelight for most of the year, the event gives the president of the general assembly, elected each year by the member states ahead of general debate, a chance to shine. This year it is Nigeria\u2019s Tijjani Muhammad-Bande. After the initial excitement of greeting the world leaders, however, it is rather a thankless task, introducing each leader to the assembly and then sitting through one speech after another, most of them turgid and self-congratulatory. What about the sideshows? This is the world\u2019s biggest summit and it attracts a lot of side events because of the proximity and potential participation of world leaders. The most glittering of these events is the Goalkeepers conference run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where celebrities, activists and politicians will talkbout global inequality.

      "body": "<p>The first thing you notice about <a href=\"https://lucyguerininc.com/\">Lucy Guerin</a>\u2019s award-winning duet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/09/split-review-lucy-guerins-sparse-and-powerful-portrait-of-escalating-conflict\">Split</a>, is that one of the dancers seems to have forgotten to put any clothes on. The two performers start moving in unison, identical except for the fact one of them is wearing a grey top and skirt, while the other is totally starkers. It seems like a provocation, but that\u2019s not what this piece is about at all.</p> <p>In fact, it was more of an afterthought. Originally, Guerin had assumed that since the dancers were doing the same thing, she\u2019d dress them in the same outfits. But when it came to designing the costumes, she realised that wasn\u2019t right. The piece evolved in her Melbourne studio and the choreographer began to see the two dancers as representing two sides of the same person. She tried various ways of characterising them \u2013 one in a unitard, one in office clothes \u2013 then alighted on the idea of no clothes at all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuI8XuWIVlE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fuI8XuWIVlE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Split by Lucy Guerin.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cWhen I asked the dancer, <a href=\"http://www.liliansteiner.com/about\">Lilian Steiner</a>, she just burst out laughing \u2013 slightly hysterically, I think,\u201d says Guerin. \u201cBut she said, if that\u2019s the right thing for the work then I want to try it. When we closed all the curtains and tried it, it seemed to reinforce this idea of the public and private self I\u2019d been thinking about. And because Lilian is completely unselfconscious, it just felt like she was doing her work as a dancer, it wasn\u2019t about being a victim or being sexual, it felt like a strong statement for a female body, so I really liked that.\u201d</p> <p>Guerin admits that nudity on stage is \u201cfraught\u201d, especially female nudity, and \u201cas the person who has the power,\u201d she felt uncomfortable asking Steiner to do it. But after getting used to it, Steiner enjoys the feeling.</p> <p>For the audience, the effect is striking. After a few minutes you don\u2019t really see the nakedness any more, but you do see the clean geometry of unclad limbs and the divide between the two dancers. Even when their moves are matching, there are all sorts of potential stories and power-plays evolving.</p> <p>Nudity aside, the real concept of Split \u2013 which came to Guerin in the shower \u2013 is based on a pleasingly simple idea. After the first 20 minutes, the dancers bisect the stage, laying down gaffer tape and restricting their performing area to one half. Ten minutes later, they halve the stage again, then again after five minutes, and so on, until the two have taped themselves into a corner, with barely room for four feet. The space becomes ever more claustrophobic and their once harmonious movements ever more fractious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6439689052a25295d8ce2f067fa5edacafbc65ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6439689052a25295d8ce2f067fa5edacafbc65ae/0_0_4508_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macbeth in collaboration with Carrie Cracknell at the Young Vic in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macbeth in collaboration with Carrie Cracknell at the Young Vic in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guerin was expecting the result to be \u201cdry and clinical and abstract and geometric\u201d but in fact, \u201cit was a much more poetic and evocative structure than I thought,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had some really diverse and very intense responses from audience members about that idea of the shrinking of time and space. Like about someone\u2019s partner dying and what that was like, very personal things.\u201d</p> <p>The simplicity of the structure, and its readability, seems to liberate audiences. \u201cFor a lot of people, that clarity makes them feel comfortable \u2013 they feel safe and it lets other thoughts, produced by the dancing, come up,\u201d says Guerin. \u201cI find sometimes people are very confused by contemporary dance and they\u2019re often wondering: what is it? But something about the framing in Split seemed to let them into the dance.\u201d</p> <p>Guerin has been making dance for 20 years, but very little of the Australian choreographer\u2019s work has actually been seen in the UK. Most recently she collaborated with theatre director Carrie Cracknell on productions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/15/medea-national-theatre-dance-carrie-cracknell\">Medea at the National Theatre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/04/macbeth-review-torture-frenzy-young-vic-london-anna-maxwell-martin\">Macbeth at the Young Vic</a>, and made a danced deconstruction of the latter play, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/11/rambert-review-lucy-guerin-dancers-macbeth\">Tomorrow</a>, for Rambert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48e336a1ea9c561ca08f96043c2899325f2ab1c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48e336a1ea9c561ca08f96043c2899325f2ab1c8/0_0_4000_2713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A strong statement for a female body ...

Lilian Steiner and Melanie Lane in Split.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregory Lorenzutti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But those works aren\u2019t typical of what she does with her own company. Much of Guerin\u2019s own dance career took place in New York, where there was still a great influence of the postmodern choreographers of the <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3927\">Judson Church</a>.

      "bodyText": "The first thing you notice about Lucy Guerin\u2019s award-winning duet, Split, is that one of the dancers seems to have forgotten to put any clothes on. The two performers start moving in unison, identical except for the fact one of them is wearing a grey top and skirt, while the other is totally starkers. It seems like a provocation, but that\u2019s not what this piece is about at all. In fact, it was more of an afterthought. Originally, Guerin had assumed that since the dancers were doing the same thing, she\u2019d dress them in the same outfits. But when it came to designing the costumes, she realised that wasn\u2019t right. The piece evolved in her Melbourne studio and the choreographer began to see the two dancers as representing two sides of the same person. She tried various ways of characterising them \u2013 one in a unitard, one in office clothes \u2013 then alighted on the idea of no clothes at all. \u201cWhen I asked the dancer, Lilian Steiner, she just burst out laughing \u2013 slightly hysterically, I think,\u201d says Guerin. \u201cBut she said, if that\u2019s the right thing for the work then I want to try it. When we closed all the curtains and tried it, it seemed to reinforce this idea of the public and private self I\u2019d been thinking about. And because Lilian is completely unselfconscious, it just felt like she was doing her work as a dancer, it wasn\u2019t about being a victim or being sexual, it felt like a strong statement for a female body, so I really liked that.\u201d Guerin admits that nudity on stage is \u201cfraught\u201d, especially female nudity, and \u201cas the person who has the power,\u201d she felt uncomfortable asking Steiner to do it. But after getting used to it, Steiner enjoys the feeling. For the audience, the effect is striking. After a few minutes you don\u2019t really see the nakedness any more, but you do see the clean geometry of unclad limbs and the divide between the two dancers. Even when their moves are matching, there are all sorts of potential stories and power-plays evolving. Nudity aside, the real concept of Split \u2013 which came to Guerin in the shower \u2013 is based on a pleasingly simple idea. After the first 20 minutes, the dancers bisect the stage, laying down gaffer tape and restricting their performing area to one half. Ten minutes later, they halve the stage again, then again after five minutes, and so on, until the two have taped themselves into a corner, with barely room for four feet. The space becomes ever more claustrophobic and their once harmonious movements ever more fractious. Guerin was expecting the result to be \u201cdry and clinical and abstract and geometric\u201d but in fact, \u201cit was a much more poetic and evocative structure than I thought,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had some really diverse and very intense responses from audience members about that idea of the shrinking of time and space. Like about someone\u2019s partner dying and what that was like, very personal things.\u201d The simplicity of the structure, and its readability, seems to liberate audiences. \u201cFor a lot of people, that clarity makes them feel comfortable \u2013 they feel safe and it lets other thoughts, produced by the dancing, come up,\u201d says Guerin. \u201cI find sometimes people are very confused by contemporary dance and they\u2019re often wondering: what is it? But something about the framing in Split seemed to let them into the dance.\u201d Guerin has been making dance for 20 years, but very little of the Australian choreographer\u2019s work has actually been seen in the UK. Most recently she collaborated with theatre director Carrie Cracknell on productions of Medea at the National Theatre and Macbeth at the Young Vic, and made a danced deconstruction of the latter play, called Tomorrow, for Rambert. But those works aren\u2019t typical of what she does with her own company. Much of Guerin\u2019s own dance career took place in New York, where there was still a great influence of the postmodern choreographers of the Judson Church. In the decades since, she has watched trends come and go, moving from postmodern to conceptual dance, from a focus on physical technique to dancers giving up going to daily class altogether. In Australia, she says, \u201cPeople are coming back to class and they seem keen to move. Although I walk past the rehearsal rooms in my studio and the dancer is often sitting there working on their laptop,\u201d she laughs. Even dance cannot escape the shift to the digital world, it seems, but Guerin values the importance of \u201cthinking through the body\u201d, of getting up and doing. Not all her experiments will end up on stage. The early weeks of Split involved \u201ca lot of time with a big roll of cellophane and dancers inside plastic bags, and learning lots of cartoon movement off YouTube, like Bugs Bunny\u201d. But in the end she came back to the fundamentals of choreography: time, space, movement and the body, in its starkest form.

Speaking to reporters on his plane en route to the UN general assembly (UNGA) in New York, the prime minister said there was \u201ca very high degree of probability\u201d that Iran was behind the drone and missile attack two major oil installation on 14 September. Stressing his desire to avoid any escalation in the rumbling crisis, Johnson said he saw the UK\u2019s role as \u201cserving as a bridge between our European friends and the Americans\u201d on the issue. The US and Saudi Arabia have previously said they believe the attack was carried out by Iran, and not by Houthi rebels battling Saudi forces in Yemen, who Iran says were to blame. Johnson was due to hold joint talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, while in New York, in the guise of the so-called E3 group, which formulates policy on Iran between the nations. Neither France nor Germany has so far said who it believed was responsible. The prime minister was also due to hold bilateral talks with Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, on Tuesday, where he will discuss the Saudi attack and the continued detention of UK-Iran dual nationals including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Speaking on the plane Johnson said one of his key objectives at UNGA was to help \u201cbring the world together in response to what happened in Saudi Arabia, in our management of Iran\u201d. He said: \u201cI can tell you that the UK is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the Aramco attacks.

And why oil, rather than, say, essential medical supplies? Is a 90-day stock the right amount for Australia?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/saudi-arabia-oil-attacks-everything-you-need-to-know\">Everything you need to know about the Saudi Arabia oil attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A bit of history helps. These agreements date back nearly 50 years, to the oil crisis of the early 1970s. The crisis arose when the Yom Kippur war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, Egypt and Syria, coincided with a massive boom in commodity markets and an ill-fated wage-price freeze in the US. The commodity boom shifted the balance of market power from a cartel of oil companies (the \u201cSeven Sisters\u201d), which had held prices artificially low, to a cartel of nations, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). Opec was dominated by Arab countries, most notably Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>In the normal course of events, the result of the market shift would have been a sharp increase in prices, followed by a gradual decline, as cartel members quietly raised their sales above the agreed quotas. And, in the long run, that\u2019s exactly what happened.</p> <p>In the short run, two dramatic events intervened. First, in October 1973, Opec happened to be meeting just as the Yom Kippur war broke out. With the Arab countries losing badly, <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/opec-enacts-oil-embargo\">their Opec imposed an embargo on oil exports to Israel\u2019s backers</a>, most importantly the United States. Although the embargo had only limited success (the ultimate settlement of the war was highly favourable to Isreal), it gave enduring force to the idea that control of oil supplies was a powerful strategic weapon.</p> <p>The second event was the failure of the US system of wage and price controls imposed by the Nixon administration in 1971. The controls were removed in 1973, with a single exception. Controls on gasoline prices remained in force until 1974, and were not fully removed until the 1980s. The inevitable result of holding prices far below the market level was a lengthy and painful period of rationing. However, the blame for this exercise was not placed on Nixon\u2019s attempt to defy the logic of markets, but on the evil machinations of Opec.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/saudi-oil-attack-shines-light-on-geopolitical-truth-and-lies\">Saudi oil attack shines light on geopolitical truth and lies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was in this context that the idea of oil as a magical commodity immune from the normal logic of economics took hold of both the popular and the bureaucratic imagination.</p> <p>How likely is it that Australia could be cut off from access to oil supplies? To begin with, it\u2019s useful to observe that, in the decades since the oil crisis, no exporting country or alliance has ever been successful in imposing an embargo for geopolitical reasons. The most notable attempts have been Russia\u2019s attempt to coerce Ukraine by cutting off supplies of natural gas, and China\u2019s restrictions on the supplies of so-called \u201crare earths\u201d to Japan.</p> <p>Both caused some initial inconvenience, but neither achieved their political goals.

      "bodyText": "The recent drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil refineries has raised fresh concerns that Australia is not meeting our obligation to the International Energy Agency to maintain oil stocks equal to 90 days of consumption. Among other things, it has been suggested that the defence forces might run out of fuel. This all sounds alarming. But a moment\u2019s thought raises more questions than answers. Why should the adequacy of our oil stocks be a matter of international concern? And why oil, rather than, say, essential medical supplies? Is a 90-day stock the right amount for Australia? A bit of history helps. These agreements date back nearly 50 years, to the oil crisis of the early 1970s. The crisis arose when the Yom Kippur war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, Egypt and Syria, coincided with a massive boom in commodity markets and an ill-fated wage-price freeze in the US. The commodity boom shifted the balance of market power from a cartel of oil companies (the \u201cSeven Sisters\u201d), which had held prices artificially low, to a cartel of nations, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). Opec was dominated by Arab countries, most notably Saudi Arabia. In the normal course of events, the result of the market shift would have been a sharp increase in prices, followed by a gradual decline, as cartel members quietly raised their sales above the agreed quotas. And, in the long run, that\u2019s exactly what happened. In the short run, two dramatic events intervened. First, in October 1973, Opec happened to be meeting just as the Yom Kippur war broke out. With the Arab countries losing badly, their Opec imposed an embargo on oil exports to Israel\u2019s backers, most importantly the United States. Although the embargo had only limited success (the ultimate settlement of the war was highly favourable to Isreal), it gave enduring force to the idea that control of oil supplies was a powerful strategic weapon. The second event was the failure of the US system of wage and price controls imposed by the Nixon administration in 1971. The controls were removed in 1973, with a single exception. Controls on gasoline prices remained in force until 1974, and were not fully removed until the 1980s. The inevitable result of holding prices far below the market level was a lengthy and painful period of rationing. However, the blame for this exercise was not placed on Nixon\u2019s attempt to defy the logic of markets, but on the evil machinations of Opec. It was in this context that the idea of oil as a magical commodity immune from the normal logic of economics took hold of both the popular and the bureaucratic imagination. How likely is it that Australia could be cut off from access to oil supplies? To begin with, it\u2019s useful to observe that, in the decades since the oil crisis, no exporting country or alliance has ever been successful in imposing an embargo for geopolitical reasons. The most notable attempts have been Russia\u2019s attempt to coerce Ukraine by cutting off supplies of natural gas, and China\u2019s restrictions on the supplies of so-called \u201crare earths\u201d to Japan. Both caused some initial inconvenience, but neither achieved their political goals. The longer-term effect was a loss of markets, as buyers sought out more reliable suppliers. In this context, it\u2019s worth noting that we import all our cars, and nearly all our parts, mostly from a small number of Asian countries . If these supplies were cut off long enough, we would truly be immobilised. Yet we have no national policy, and certainly no international agreements, mandating any particular level of stocks.

It feels like the result of an expanded and more diverse academy, voters who are younger and less willing to reward the obvious, safer choices.

Amy Adams, Michael Douglas, Viola Davis, Michelle Williams, Hugh Grant, Mahershala Ali and Benicio Del Toro are just some of the A-listers in contention tonight and with competition this fierce, it\u2019s made the whole thing way harder to predict.</p> <p>Perhaps the surest bet of the evening is that you\u2019ll be hearing the words Game of Thrones quite a lot with HBO\u2019s extravagant fantasy drama leading the pack with 32 nominations. It\u2019s been a TV academy favourite for years and given that this will be the final time they\u2019ll get to reward it, expect a big showing. The same can also be said for Veep, which could well dominate the comedy side of things. But there\u2019s also an exciting influx of newer shows and talent from Succession to Fleabag so some surprises could be in store.</p> <p>Stay with us for the night if you want to see how it all unfolds, from awkward moments to earnest speeches to relentless reminders that you\u2019ve been bingeing the wrong shows. We\u2019ll be here until late! <br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So while the ceremony might have felt like a drag at times (did all of those awards really need to be televised) and while the decision not to have a host didn\u2019t pay off quite as well as it did for the Oscars, there were enough surprise wins to make this year\u2019s Emmys a compelling night. The biggest story was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose self-confessed \u201cpervy\u201d show cursing its way into the hearts of Emmy voters was something not many had predicted, especially given the competition. It was less of a surprise that Game of Thrones would win the biggest award of the night but the dramatic categories did at least offer some surprise acting wins, such as Billy Porter and Jodie Comer. Brits enjoyed a strong showing across the board, the best for years, with further wins for Ben Whishaw, Charlie Brooker and Jesse Armstrong. It feels like the Emmys is in need of a clearer vision for the ceremony next year, as well as some more logical music cues, and I have a feeling that when the ratings come in tomorrow, the night will be down on last year but the unpredictability made it mostly tolerable. It feels like the result of an expanded and more diverse academy, voters who are younger and less willing to reward the obvious, safer choices. Here\u2019s hoping that same riskiness pays off at the Oscars come February ... Here\u2019s your full news wrap: One of tonight\u2019s biggest surprise winners was Jodie Comer, named outstanding lead actress in a drama series for Killing Eve. Here\u2019s Rebecca Nicholson\u2019s interview with her from earlier this year: Someone asked Chernobyl writer Craig Mazin backstage if a second season was happening and errr yeah, no it\u2019s not: \u201cWe will not be doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe told a story of a place in time and we did it pretty darn well, and it\u2019s time to start thinking about other places and other times \u2026 whatever we look at, whether it\u2019s fiction or based on history, it\u2019s relevant to who we are now and what we\u2019re facing.\u201d Backstage, Michelle Williams expanded on her speech on gender pay inequality: An important re-reminder here of the night\u2019s most memorable speech, courtesy of Michelle Williams: Let\u2019s hope she has a suitable rucksack with her: When it comes down to the networks and streaming services behind the scenes, the night\u2019s big winner was HBO, who last year tied with Netflix with 23 wins each. This year the channel was way out in the lead with 32 awards. Netflix finished second with 27 and Amazon was third with 15. An interesting moment backstage here: Fair: Gwyneth\u2019s on stage entrance has already become a \u201cme\u201d meme: The unusual number of surprise wins tonight meant that there were some notable snubs including no love for the final season of Veep and star Julia Louis-Dreyfus while Sharp Objects and Escape at Dannemora were also left out in the cold. Apparently Bill Hader was asked about the firing of Saturday Night Live cast member Shane Gillis after racist comments were unearthed. Backstage he avoided tackling the question, saying: \u201cNo, I have no thoughts on that.\u201d He added: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t want to hurt anybody\u2019s feelings, I think especially in comedy. [If] you did stuff six or seven years ago that wouldn\u2019t be good now, that\u2019s for good reason ... Like everybody, you have to grow.\u201d And here\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s final speech of the night in case you haven\u2019t seen it yet: While Game of Thrones only won two televised awards tonight, it picked up 12 in total with the technical wins at the Creative Arts Emmys earlier this month. It\u2019s only the second time a show has won 12 Emmys in one year. The last time was in 2015 and the show was, yup, Game of Thrones! In case you need to recap on who won what tonight, here\u2019s a list of the main winners: A snippet here of Billy Porter\u2019s moving speech: Aaand as predicted, the final season of HBO\u2019s hit fantasy drama has won the night\u2019s biggest trophy. It was a critically divisive season but given that it was the Academy\u2019s final chance to show its support for the show, this was a foregone conclusion. Given that the show lost out on some of the other big awards it was up for, it\u2019s not quite the sweep many expected though. Woah and Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s dark comedy has pulled off one of the night\u2019s biggest surprises winning out against the final season of Veep and Emmys favourite The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. \u201cThis is just getting ridiculous,\u201d Waller-Bridge says on stage. She jokes that she told two jokes over a pint and got the show optioned. She also gives a big shoutout for Andrew Scott who received a huge applause from a sexy priest-loving crowd. Every time: More British success here with Jodie Comer deservedly winning for her villainous role in the acclaimed drama Killing Eve. She beat out co-star Sandra Oh who many tipped to win, following on from her Bafta win, and it continues a huge night for Phoebe Waller-Bridge who created the show. Well another surprise win here for Ozark, a show that\u2019s clearly being appreciated by the Academy more than it\u2019s being appreciated by critics and another dent for Game of Thrones, which is quickly losing out on some of the bigger awards. But can it still win the last award of the night? A big win here for Billy Porter in a stacked category that also includes Jason Bateman and Kit Harington. \u201cThe category is love y\u2019all!\u201d he says, clearly overjoyed before delivering a powerful James Baldwin quote about having the right to be here and to be seen. \u201cWe are the people that get to change the molecular structure of the hearts and minds of the people that live on this planet,\u201d he adds in one of the most crowd-friendly moments of the night, receiving a standing ovation. And the award for best Felicity Huffman joke goes to: In case you didn\u2019t see it, here\u2019s some of Patricia Arquette\u2019s emotive speech: Big surprise here with the Ozark star winning against THREE Game of Thrones cast members. She seems as surprised as we are, giving a genuine and emotional speech. It\u2019s a big boost for the show which has received a lot of nominations from different bodies but never usually wins. A lovely surprise here given that Game of Thrones was also stuffed in this category with The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Killing Eve. \u201cQuite a lot of British winners, maybe too many, might want to have a think about those immigration restrictions,\u201d Armstrong quips on stage. A much-deserved win here for one of the best and least awarded shows on TV right now. And this could be the start of Game of Thrones winning the evening. \u201cI count myself so fortunate to be a member of a community that is all about tolerance and diversity,\u201d Dinklage says for winning yet another award for his performance in the hit series. There are swears! The first of the evening which were bleeped out but will surely get revealed on Twitter within minutes. Twitter has been wondering what the hell is going on with RuPaul and Billy Porter: And here it is: Fleabag be Fleabaggin: The fourth win in a row in this category for John Oliver\u2019s acclaimed HBO series. \u201cThank you to Game of Thrones for the lead in over these years,\u201d he jokes on stage. The ninth win here for SNL\u2019s Don Roy King, a show that the Emmys continues to reward year after year. But two awards tonight after a mostly laugh-free season does make one wonder if anyone from the Academy has been watching it lately. There\u2019s been a ton of great Chernobyl content on the site but here\u2019s one of the most revealing and fascinating reads: The Emmys music tonight has been odd and I\u2019m not the only one a bit confused by some of the intros: It was a hugely underwhelming season but that didn\u2019t stop SNL from winning this one yet again. It\u2019s the most nominated show of all time with more than 250 nods to date. The show\u2019s big chief, Lorne Michaels, is using the speech to pay tribute to Chris Farley, whose legacy was part of the episode he submitted this year, hosted by Adam Sandler. Emmys mainstay John Oliver is on stage with his very big and very talented writing staff, beating out Stephen Colbert\u2019s and Samantha Bee\u2019s teams. For anyone who watches the show, even in snippets, it\u2019s a much-deserved win and implies that the show will probably win variety series in a few awards time. Here\u2019s a snippet of Michelle Williams\u2019s speech, unarguably the most powerful of the night thus far: Aaaand to the bizarrely picked sounds of Nina Simone\u2019s Feeling Good, the tough but gripping series about the Chernobyl disaster has picked up one of the night\u2019s biggest awards, beating out Ava DuVernay\u2019s When They See Us. \u201cWe can make stories be known permanently,\u201d Craig Mazin says about the importance of telling true stories on screen. No big surprise here given that she was one of the biggest names in the category and that her performance was seen by pretty much everyone as the best thing about a show that had a mixed response from critics. Given her history of being unfairly underpaid because of her gender, Williams is using the moment to speak out about gender parity in the workplace. It\u2019s a powerful speech, delivered quite wonderfully. Now it\u2019s time for a Veep tribute given that we\u2019ve just seen its final season. The cast have all arrived on stage and this time the camera crew have wisely avoided checking to see if Gwyneth is engaged or not. Oh wait, they found her! She\u2019s still bored! More Brits on stage here with Charlie Brooker beating out Deadwood: The Movie and Brexit with the interactive Christmas episode. \u201cI think being British we were conditioned to think 52% of you would vote for Brexit,\u201d Brooker says, one of the sharper jabs of the night. Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s disinterest in the Game of Thrones cast on stage has been attracting attention on the Twitter A highly competitive category here, which also included Hugh Grant and Mahershala Ali, but a much-deserved win for Moonlight star Jharrel Jerome, whose performance in Ava DuVernay\u2019s Central Park Five drama was arguably the most haunting. \u201cI feel like I should be in the Bronx right now,\u201d he says before expressing love for his mother, which chokes him up. He ends with a shoutout for the five men in the audience, leading to a big audience response. It\u2019s a huge win against more high-profile actors and suggests that Chernobyl might not be the big limited series winner after all. More love here for Chernobyl and a big award for its writer whose previous credits include The Hangover 2 and The Hangover 3. It\u2019s looking like Chernobyl could end up triumphing over When They See Us, which has yet to pick up anything tonight. A much deserved win here for Ben Whishaw for his effective turn in the fact-based drama who just complained on stage about being hungover, not an ideal place to be hungover in front of an audience who didn\u2019t seem to find it very funny. Yeah this was awkward... A sign of Emmy support for the grim HBO/Sky drama despite starrier competition, including Stephen Frears and Ava DuVernay. It\u2019s undeniably the most cinematic show on the list and now all eyes are waiting to see whether Chernobyl or When They See Us will win for limited series in a few awards time. Two nominations for Arquette tonight and she\u2019s won her first for a role in Hulu\u2019s fact-based crime drama. Many, including myself, predicted Patricia Clarkson to win this for Sharp Objects but there has been huge support for this show, Hulu\u2019s biggest ever numbers-wise. \u201cI\u2019m grateful at 50 to be geting the best parts of my life,\u201d she says before a tearful ode to sister Alexis Arquette and a rallying cry for more trans acceptance, one of the night\u2019s most touching moments. Seth Meyers in on stage to ermmm introduce a montage of Game of Thrones scenes? Sure, makes sense. Just a reminder that the show was a record 32 nominations tonight and will likely be the big winner. Oh and now the cast has assembled on stage or at least some of the bigger names. There\u2019s a standing ovation, including from the cast members who weren\u2019t invited to join them. Someone needs to sort this out fast No big surprise here given that RuPaul had already picked up an award for host at the Creative Arts Emmys earlier this month. \u201cSpeaking of voting and love, go and register to vote,\u201d he said at the end of his speech, before giving a URL to the audience, the first political moment of the night if that\u2019s on your bingo card. And she did it! Many predicted another win for Rachel Brosnahan or Julia Louis-Dreyfus but Phoebe Waller-Bridge has found herself on stage yet again. She\u2019s overwhelmed again, understandably! Maybe season three might not be such an impossibility now ... \u201cWell, well, well, how\u2019s the old no host thing going?\u201d Stephen Colbert asks before Jimmy Kimel jokes that even Applebee\u2019s has a host. Kimmel just made a joke about feigning interest in Jason Bateman\u2019s vacation stories which led to a pretty amusing reaction shot of Bateman\u2019s heart quietly breaking, soon to be a gif. Here\u2019s a quick snippet of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s speech if you fancy a gander: Another actually rather funny intro from Maya Rudolph and Ike Barinholtz, who pretended to have arrived directly from laser eye surgery which led to them misreading every nominee. Rudolph called Michael Douglas Nicky Twotimes, for example. Barry\u2019s Bill Hader beat out Anthony Anderson, Ted Danson and the aforementioned Douglas for one of the night\u2019s biggest awards for a show that the Emmys continues to praise. Another big win for Fleabag, beating out Emmys favourite The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. \u201cFor a director, something like Fleabag only comes once in your life,\u201d Harry Bradbeer says before panicking that he only has 28 seconds left before he gets kicked off the stage. Can Fleabag continue its streak and win some even bigger trophies? True Wahey. A big win here for Fleabag\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who has two shows in contention with this and Killing Eve in the dramatic categories. She\u2019s rather overwhelmed. \u201cI find writing really hard and really painful but I\u2019d like to say from the bottom of my heart that the reason I do it is this,\u201d she says to much laughter before thanking everyone involved with her acclaimed BBC comedy. She says she\u2019s reassured that a dirty, pervy and angry woman can make it to the Emmys. As are we. Aggressive ads tonight for The Masked Singer given that it\u2019s on the same network as the Emmys, which now means that Ken Jeong and Nick Cannon are doing a thirsty \u201cplease make this viral\u201d but about making a TikTok for his kids. It\u2019s like the memorable Ellen selfie except that it\u2019s entirely, annoyingly forgettable instead. Amy Poehler and Catherone O\u2019Hara arrived on stage to announce this one with a bit that will most likely be retweeted with the words \u2018THESE TWO FOR EMMYS HOSTS 2020!!!1\u201d but they were rather undeniably funny, the only amusing moment so far. Another win here for The Marvelous Mrs Maisel with Alex Borstein winning for the second year in a row, beating out Fleabag\u2019s Olivia Colman. She just said the audience reminds her of a hot bikram yoga class as there are lots of hot and nervous women. Quite a powerful speech after about women needing to step out of line to be heard. Video footage coming later. More stars in dresses! It\u2019s the first award of the night and the fourth Emmy for Tony Shalhoub. \u201cLike many of you, I\u2019m not a fan of those endless lists,\u201d he says before understandably getting out his own list to thank the team of the acclaimed Amazon show. He beat out Henry Winkler to win this one and it\u2019s a strong sign that Maisel may be the biggest comedic winner of the night but can it win the big awards against the final season of Veep? I mean... So without a host the ceremony has started with Homer Simpson on stage as a fake host and plenty of confused celebrity reactions given that he\u2019s animated and not there at all. What year is it and why is Homer Simpson considered a zeitgeisty figure to kick things off with? An \u201caccident\u201d has meant that Anthony Anderson has to \u201csave the Emmys\u201d in a rather frantic and unfunny bit. So now Bryan Cranston is the new host instead, he who hasn\u2019t appeared on TV since Breaking Bad ended. Again, huh? He\u2019s talking about the moon landing in what\u2019s now being taken very seriously, going through the history of TV. Tonally, this is all over the shop already. \u201cTelevision has never been bigger, television has never mattered more and television has never been this damn good\u201d he says before a montage. Woof. This year\u2019s ceremony will follow in the footsteps of the Oscars by going host-less, a relief to anyone who endured Michael Che and Colin Jost\u2019s wildly unfunny performance in 2018. There\u2019s a whole bunch of big name presenters though, including: Gwyneth Paltrow, Jon Hamm, Kerry Washington, Naomi Watts, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Ben Stiller, Viola Davis, Angela Bassett and the cast of the Kardashians. Suits are less suity than usual! Who wore it better? Ava DuVernay is here with the Central Park Five and her Netflix drama, When They See Us, about the injustices they faced is set to be one of the night\u2019s big winners: Because there are roughly 13,000 awards to give out, earlier this month the Creative Arts Emmys took place to ensure that tonight\u2019s ceremony isn\u2019t three days long. Here are some of the major winners (it was a good night for Game of Thrones which could be a good sign of how things work out later): Outstanding guest actress in a drama: Cherry Jones (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) Outstanding guest actor in a comedy: Luke Kirby (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel) Outstanding special visual effects: Game of Thrones Outstanding guest actor in a drama: Bradley Whitford (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) Outstanding guest actress in a comedy: Jane Lynch (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel) Outstanding original main title theme music: Succession Outstanding structured reality program: Queer Eye Outstanding documentary: Leaving Neverland Outstanding host for a reality program: RuPaul (RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race) So word is that the red carpet is aggressively humid today thanks to a particularly scorching LA day which has led to big industrial hanging fans, water on hand and a touch-up station for celebrities to ensure they\u2019re looking as unsweaty as possible. The girls from Go Fug Yourself are already prepping for some underarm embarrassment: People are here! Wearing things! Here they are! Laverne Cox has arrived with ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio to highlight the case of Aimee Stephens who next month will become the first plaintiff in a case about the civil rights of transgender people before the Supreme Court. Stephens was fired after coming out at work as trans. Here\u2019s a closer look at her bag: As mentioned, it\u2019s a tough night to predict given the fierce competition but brave Guardian warrior Adrian Horton has battled through her fears of being completely, shamefully wrong to deliver this sturdy list of guesses: Taylor Swift fans are getting excited about Taylor Swift maybe being at the Emmys and it\u2019s all based on this picture of a white woman in a dress being spotted: A surprise return tonight for Billy Bush, back at the Emmys for the first time since his Trump Access Hollywood scandal. He\u2019s back at Extra and will be interviewing celebrities tonight as they arrive on the red carpet which could lead to some interestingly awkward moments. If you like to imagine the kind of awkward small talk that might occur in the audience during commercial breaks then these pictures of who\u2019s sitting where should help: Game of Thrones v Killing Eve! Veep v The Marvelous Mrs Maisel! Julia Louis-Dreyfus v Phoebe Waller-Bridge! Your unwavering attention v your desire to sleep! It\u2019s time for battle upon battle upon battle yet again with TV\u2019s biggest night of the year, the 71st edition of the Emmys. You\u2019ve probably not heard this mentioned at all by anyone ever but we\u2019re in a \u201cgolden era\u201d of television, which other than being hugely stressful for anyone hoping to keep on top of it all has meant that the Emmys has become starrier than ever before. Amy Adams, Michael Douglas, Viola Davis, Michelle Williams, Hugh Grant, Mahershala Ali and Benicio Del Toro are just some of the A-listers in contention tonight and with competition this fierce, it\u2019s made the whole thing way harder to predict. Perhaps the surest bet of the evening is that you\u2019ll be hearing the words Game of Thrones quite a lot with HBO\u2019s extravagant fantasy drama leading the pack with 32 nominations. It\u2019s been a TV academy favourite for years and given that this will be the final time they\u2019ll get to reward it, expect a big showing. The same can also be said for Veep, which could well dominate the comedy side of things. But there\u2019s also an exciting influx of newer shows and talent from Succession to Fleabag so some surprises could be in store. Stay with us for the night if you want to see how it all unfolds, from awkward moments to earnest speeches to relentless reminders that you\u2019ve been bingeing the wrong shows. We\u2019ll be here until late!",

This month the federal court awarded Ridd $1.2m in compensation. The court has made clear its finding related to Ridd\u2019s employment rights and not his academic freedom. After JCU lodged its appeal and most of the compensation payout was ordered to be quarantined in a trust account, Ridd relaunched a public fundraising site for his legal costs. The site has collected more than $350,000 in total public donations, including about $100,000 in the past 24 hours. In recent months Ridd has held a speaking tour, promoted by agricultural groups, that supported their campaign against new Great Barrier Reef pollution regulations. Ridd has personally promoted their cause and joined lobbying efforts. In a statement soliciting donations, Ridd cites his position on the reef issue \u2013 which disputes the scientific consensus and has been compared with the strategy used by the tobacco industry to raise doubt about the impact of smoking \u2013 as a \u201cpoint of principle we must fight for\u201d. \u201cJCU will use its infinite financial resources \u2013 effectively government money \u2013 to appeal,\u201d Ridd said. He said donations would \u201csend a powerful message to governments about what the public expect of our universities\u201d. The court last week put a stay on the compensation payout. JCU is required pay more than $1.2m into a trust administered by Ridd\u2019s lawyer. Of that money $1m will be quarantined and $215,000 made available for Ridd\u2019s legal costs. In April federal circuit court judge Salvatore Vasta found the actions of the university, including Ridd\u2019s repeated censure and ultimate dismissal, were unlawful. Vasta made clear the case was about employment law and not \u2013 as Ridd, his supporters and conservative media outlets have repeatedly stated \u2013 about academic freedom. \u201cSome have thought that this trial was about freedom of speech and intellectual freedom,\u201d Vasta said. \u201cMedia reports have considered that this trial was about silencing persons with controversial or unpopular views. \u201cRather, this trial was purely and simply about the proper construction of a clause in an enterprise agreement.\u201d JCU\u2019s appeal argues there are \u201cerrors of law\u201d in the judgments.",

But while the barbs rain beautifully and relentlessly throughout, this episode carries sombre weight, with Kendall forced to face up once again to the terrible secret he has borne since the first series.</p> <p>He\u2019s chipper at the start, though, acquiescing to demands for a \u201cdick pic\u201d from Naomi. Shiv, by contrast, is finding Tom more of a pest than a partner, too preoccupied with her own pursuit of succession to handle his constant, solipsistic anxiety, tonight over an impending internal investigation into his period at Parks.</p> <p>She\u2019s frustrated because she can\u2019t get a meeting with Logan about a memo she\u2019s written. Again, he\u2019s cut her out of family business as he orders a trip to London to appease wavering shareholders; one \u201cJack the Ulsterman\u201d \u2013 and the other Logan\u2019s ex-wife Caroline. He\u2019ll deal with Jack. Kendall and Roman are to butter up their mother.</p> <p>En route to Britain, Logan attempts an apology to Roman for \u201caccidentally\u201d striking him, which descends into a morass of awkwardness and denial by both.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Succession season two, which airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episode seven. \u2018I suppose everyone has to apologise for everything nowadays\u2019 Following the collapse of Logan\u2019s plans to buy out PGM, Waystar face the prospect of a shareholder\u2019s revolt, requiring a charm offensive from a family who do offensive far better than they do charm. But while the barbs rain beautifully and relentlessly throughout, this episode carries sombre weight, with Kendall forced to face up once again to the terrible secret he has borne since the first series. He\u2019s chipper at the start, though, acquiescing to demands for a \u201cdick pic\u201d from Naomi. Shiv, by contrast, is finding Tom more of a pest than a partner, too preoccupied with her own pursuit of succession to handle his constant, solipsistic anxiety, tonight over an impending internal investigation into his period at Parks. She\u2019s frustrated because she can\u2019t get a meeting with Logan about a memo she\u2019s written. Again, he\u2019s cut her out of family business as he orders a trip to London to appease wavering shareholders; one \u201cJack the Ulsterman\u201d \u2013 and the other Logan\u2019s ex-wife Caroline. He\u2019ll deal with Jack. Kendall and Roman are to butter up their mother. En route to Britain, Logan attempts an apology to Roman for \u201caccidentally\u201d striking him, which descends into a morass of awkwardness and denial by both. On the plane, the brothers are surprised to find that Rhea, sacked CEO of PGM, is along for the ride. Privately, Logan sounds her out about the succession, revealing that he\u2019s genuinely undecided. She gives fair but disparaging assessments of all three sibling contenders.
