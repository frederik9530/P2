Now we have two-thirds of the answer: wait for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/02/us-open-title-defence-ends-as-novak-djokovic-departs-to-boos-after-retiring-hurt\">Djokovic to be cut down by a shoulder injury in the last 16</a> and then let <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/04/us-open-roger-federer-grigor-dimitrov\">the man formerly known as Baby Federer take out the actual and ailing Federer over five sets in the quarter-finals</a>. Of course Rafael Nadal is still standing, and is looking in ominous form before his semi-final later against the brave or perhaps foolhardy Matteo Berrettini, but Medvedev or Dimitrov will have to leave that last part of the problem until another day. First they must face off for a place in their debut grand slam final.<br></p> <p>For the 23-year-old Medvedev, this is his first major semi-final; for the 28-year-old Dimitrov, this is his third in a career that hasn\u2019t lived up to its tremendous promise. While Medvedev arrived in New York as the man of the hardcourt summer, having defeated Djokovic en route to the Cincinnati title and reached the Washington and Montreal finals, Dimitrov was the forgotten man. The former world No 3 entered this tournament down at 78<sup>th</sup> after an awful, injury-affected season in which he had lost seven of his past eight matches, including to the world No 405 six weeks ago. But Dimitrov\u2019s victory over Federer from two sets to one down was a comeback in more ways than one. Rarely have there been such remarkable turnarounds in form.<br></p> <p>Despite taking out Federer, Dimitrov will have the crowd on his side against Medvedev, whose summer of success has not exactly turned into one of love. The quirky and controversial Russian, carrying an ever-increasing number of injuries after his exertions of late, has defiantly moved through the draw amid a chorus of boos, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/31/daniil-medvedev-us-open-crowd-flushing-meadows\">started in the third round</a> when he snatched a towel from a ballboy, gave spectators the middle finger and then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjzero/status/1167655482745638912\">trolled them in his on-court interview</a>.<br></p> <p>The jeers and sarcastic retorts have continued since. But after Medvedev\u2019s superb six weeks, during which he has<strong> </strong>risen to fourth in the rankings behind Djokovic, Nadal and Federer \u2013 or \u201cthe No 1 among mere mortals\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/05/grigor-dimitrov-us-open-daniil-medvedev-semi-final\">my colleague Tumaini Carayol writes</a> \u2013 it would be a shame if he didn\u2019t let his tennis do the talking in the biggest match of his life.</p> <p><strong>The players will be on court at:</strong> 4pm New York time/9pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T19:22:53.706Z\">at 8.22pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

When I was going to the USA, I didn\u2019t know it would be that good [winning 20 out of 22 matches]. I have to say I love the USA! If someone told me it wouldn\u2019t be easy because of cramping, or with the crowd, I would have thought I was going home. Finally I\u2019m standing here before playing a final on Sunday and I\u2019m just really happy. Just as you guys will be watching [the second semi-final] here, I\u2019ll be watching it with popcorn in front of the TV. Medvedev is demanding the ball back when he edges 30-15 ahead. It must be his lucky ball, because a serve and a miscued return from Dimitrov later and it\u2019s 40-15, another two match points. Another failed return from Dimitrov and that\u2019s that, Medvedev is through to his first grand slam final after a quite sensational summer! A member of the much-hyped Next Gen has finally reached a major final! He struts to the net, flapping his arms in an unorthodox and understated celebration, and after all the booing he\u2019s experienced this tournament, even the crowd are cheering! Third set: *Medvedev 7-6, 6-4, 5-3 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) Medvedev starts as he means to go on, by taking the first point. But Dimitrov shows great resolve to secure the next two, the second after a high-quality exchange. Medvedev gets to 30-all. A huge point. Will it be match point or game point? Match point, because Medvedev, once again having dug himself a trench beyond the baseline, holds firm and Dimitrov makes the error. Medvedev then decides to come out of it, getting a little over-excited and sending a backhand well long. Deuce. Advantage Medvedev, a second match point. Dimitrov nails his first serve and Medvedev can only shank into the skies. Deuce. Advantage Dimitrov. Game Dimitrov! But now Medvedev will serve for the match. And the stadium is virtually silent. Third set: Medvedev 7-6, 6-4, 5-2 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) At this stage, Dimitrov may have to hope that Medvedev loses his nerve so close to the finishing line. Medvedev is certainly a bit jittery, his first serve has gone missing in action, but Dimitrov just can\u2019t take advantage on return, getting to 30 when he should really go further. The Bulgarian is on the brink, while Medvedev stands potentially only one game away from his first slam final. Third set: *Medvedev 7-6, 6-4, 4-2 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) Medvedev holds with absolute ease, to 15, as does Dimitrov, but surely it\u2019s too late for the Bulgarian. Even the crowd seem to have given up on their man, cheering with little belief when Dimitrov wraps up the game. Third set: *Medvedev 7-6, 6-4, 3-1 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) Bad news for the Arthur Ashe patrons: Dimitrov has never won a match from two sets to love down. And that pattern seems unlikely to change here, when Dimitrov dips two break points down at 15-40 after a double fault. And the first break point pretty much sums up Dimitrov\u2019s problem; he\u2019s finding it so hard to hit through the Russian, who stands far behind the baseline, gets everything back so flat, and despite all the tape on his right arm and left leg, and the litany of injuries he\u2019s had this fortnight, is just refusing to budge. Djokovic may have gone out of this tournament in the last 16 but this guy, with his masterful defence, is doing a pretty good impression of the world No 1. Third set: Medvedev 7-6, 6-4, 2-1 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) The crowd haven\u2019t really been booing Medvedev today, but they\u2019re almost silent as the Russian serves out to love at the start of the third set. And they certainly won\u2019t be cheering if/when he completes the most significant victory of his career. The New York crowd clearly don\u2019t forget. Just ask Novak Djokovic. He\u2019s still paying for having a pop at Andy Roddick in 2008. Dimitrov, meanwhile, gets in on the love hold act, before Medvedev holds once more. Plenty of oohs and aaahs at 30-15, as Dimitrov repeatedly tries to pierce holes in Medvedev\u2019s defence without success. 30-all. 40-30. Deuce, when Medvedev decides to become the aggressor and thwacks one way before cracking it the other. A superb point then plays out, and the crowd are on their feet when a backpedalling Dimitrov flicks down a smash before backing it up with another. Advantage Dimitrov. Deuce. Advantage Dimitrov. Deuce. Remember, Medvedev only needs another two points for the set. Now it\u2019s just one, because Dimitrov chips and charges and Medvedev marmalises a backhand past the Bulgarian. And Dimitrov dumps into the net on set point! Medvedev is now only a set away from his first slam final, after edging a captivating climax to the second chapter of this match. Second set: Medvedev 7-6, 5-4 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) Dimitrov somehow drags himself to 15-all with a backhand at full stretch which sneaks down the line for the winner. And they then outdo the 33-shot exchange of the previous game with a 39-shot duel, which is won by Medvedev. The Russian, sucking for air, buys himself a little time by challenging the call on his first serve. He\u2019s unsuccessful. And he goes on to lose the point after a failed foray to the net. He hasn\u2019t won a point there all set. \u201cThese long rallies are not going to be helpful for whoever has to face Nadal in the final,\u201d points out Adam Hirst. \u201cAssuming blahblahblah \u2026\u201d The game goes to deuce, and then at Medvedev\u2019s advantage Dimitrov shows lovely touch to draw Medvedev forward before pinging the perfect lob over his 6ft 6in opponent. Dimitrov invites Medvedev to the net again on the next point, but this time Medvedev is victorious after a bit of rat-a-tat. Medvedev needs another advantage or two before eventually squeezing through the most absorbing game of the match so far. Second set: *Medvedev 7-6, 4-4 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) Watching Medvedev\u2019s mid-match snacking has made me rather hungry, so it\u2019s a good thing the two engage in a 33-shot rally to give me a bit of time to much on some rice cakes. Dimitrov eventually brings the point to an end with a vicious inside-out forehand. That\u2019s the highlight of a game in which Dimitrov holds to 15. Second set: Medvedev 7-6, 4-3 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) Medvedev munches on his third banana of the match at the changeover, but it doesn\u2019t give him sufficient energy to halt Dimitrov\u2019s mini-revival. Dimitrov holds to 30, and then Medvedev holds himself. Two consecutive holds, strange times. That hasn\u2019t happened in a while. Second set: Medvedev 7-6, 3-2 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) But just as in the early stages of the first set, the momentum is ebbing and flowing. 0-40, three break-back points for Dimitrov, after a little run-in at the net when Dimitrov\u2019s backhand clips the tape and wrongfoots Medvedev, who gestures at his opponent as if to say: \u201cAre you going to apologise?\u201d Medvedev may want to pipe down given the way he\u2019s been riling the crowd this tournament. But I digress. All three break points go begging. But here\u2019s a fourth at Dimitrov\u2019s advantage, after a seventh double fault from Medvedev. The crowd are screaming, willing their chosen man to get back into this. And that he does. How important could that prove to be? Second set: *Medvedev 7-6, 3-1 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) \u201cEvening Katy,\u201d says a tipsy Simon McMahon. \u201cI\u2019ll apologise in advance, since I\u2019ve had a few, but after Scotland\u2019s tremendous 2-1 defeat to Russia at Hampden, I\u2019m really rooting for Andy tonight. We need him. He\u2019ll sort Medvedev out next year, no doubt.\u201d Well Dimitrov can\u2019t sort Medvedev out, because Medvedev has advantage on the Bulgarian\u2019s serve. Medvedev is just such a hard player to break down, and he seems to be breaking Dimitrov\u2019s resolve just a little here. The first break point comes and goes but here\u2019s a second. With Dimitrov at the net, Medvedev waits for his opponent to pick his side, and then sends a backhand pass the other way. That\u2019s three games on the spin for the rising Russian. Second set: Medvedev 7-6, 2-1 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) But then it\u2019s Dimitrov who\u2019s shrugging his shoulders when he\u2019s promptly broken to love. What a weak concession from the Bulgarian, who ripped up his tactics there, getting impatient with the backhand slice and instead launching too many premature attacks. Medvedev then holds to 30, for the first hold of this set. Second set: Medvedev 7-6, 0-1 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) Agreed Jack. If Dimitrov can stick to his game plan he\u2019s still capable of winning this semi-final. As if to illustrate the point, Dimitrov breaks right at the start of the second, from deuce, though that was more about Medvedev\u2019s errors than exceptional play from Dimitrov. Cue a sarcastic thumbs-up from Medvedev to his box. ... before chucking in a double fault. 4-3 Medvedev, so they\u2019re back on serve. But then it\u2019s Dimitrov\u2019s turn to get in on the double faulting act. 5-3 Medvedev. 5-4, when Medvedev goes long. The Russian has two points on his racket to close out the set, but there hasn\u2019t been much straighforward about this first set. Medvedev makes the error and it\u2019s 5-5. Dimitrov tries to slice and dice Medvedev into submission on the next point, it\u2019s the right tactic, but when he then comes to pull the trigger he blows himself up. So Medvedev has a set point at 6-5 on Dimitrov\u2019s serve ... Medvedev defends superbly and Dimitrov, slightly off-balance, balloons long! Medvedev pinches the first set after an hour, despite Dimitrov being the aggressor, having the stats in his favour and holding that set point in game 12. First-set tie-break: *Medvedev 4-2 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) Will Dimitrov manage to put that missed set point out of his mind? He gets the first mini-break with a delicate backhand volley for 2-0. But Medvedev, with perhaps a bit more zip in his serve, matches Dimitrov with the next two points for 2-2. And then overtakes him for 4-2 at the changeover ... First set: Medvedev 6-6 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) A quite ridiculous shot from Medvedev at 15-all when his squash shot under such pressure from Dimitrov somehow lands on the line. That\u2019s one for the highlights package. 30-15. 40-15. Dimitrov wants to challenge but he hasn\u2019t got any left. But it matters not because he rattles off the next three points to get to his advantage, and more importantly set point. Medvedev repels it, and eventually holds when Dimitrov\u2019s forehand flies off the tape and into the tramlines, when the Bulgarian really should have done better. So it\u2019s tie-break time! First set: *Medvedev 5-6 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) There\u2019s nothing giving here. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. That\u2019s 11 consecutive points on serve for Dimitrov, who\u2019s guaranteed himself at least a tie-break. First set: Medvedev 5-5 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) Medvedev tightens up with a foot fault at 30-all but Dimitrov doesn\u2019t take advantage. Medvedev comes through from there and with 41 minutes gone, both players are refusing to blink at the business end of this first set. Given Medvedev\u2019s physical ailments this fortnight, perhaps it\u2019s a set that he needs to win more than Dimitrov. First set: *Medvedev 4-5 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) A perfect service game from Dimitrov, his first of the match, leaves Medvedev knowing he must hold to stay in the set. And with little to talk about in that game, John McEnroe muses on the commentary at the changeover about how Dimitrov has apparently never touched a drop of alcohol, such is his devotion to tennis. These tee-total tennis players, eh? I wonder if he did break his ban whether he\u2019d end up brushing his teeth with his face cream a la Andy Murray. First set: Medvedev 4-4 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) Despite Dimitrov having the greater grand slam pedigree and experience, there\u2019s a sense he has less to lose in this match than Medvedev, what with Dimitrov having absolutely no expectations on him coming into the tournament. Dimitrov is pushing Medvedev at 30-all, but a strong serve gets Medvedev out of trouble. 40-30. And the net gods are on Medvedev\u2019s side when his shot clips the tape and just trickles over, and Dimitrov doesn\u2019t have enough time to respond. First set: *Medvedev 3-4 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) The racket switch seems to be paying off here, as Medvedev secures a no-nonsense hold to 15. He then takes the first point on Dimitrov\u2019s serve for 0-15, before the Bulgarian restores parity with one of those beautiful one-handed backhands down the line. 15-all. Both players are hitting sweet and true during the next exchange, which Medvedev edges. 15-30. 30-all. There\u2019s a feeling after the topsy-turvy start that both players are finding their range at the same time. A metronomic fifth point plays out, Dimitrov decides he\u2019s had enough of moving right and left and right and left, and goes for broke. 30-40, break point Medvedev. A great kick-serve bamboozles Medvedev, who at deuce is then duped by a delightful drop shot. Advantage Dimitrov. Game Dimitrov. First set: *Medvedev 2-3 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) Dimitrov races to 30-0 on serve, making that nine of the last 10 points he\u2019s won. Medvedev, usually a model of consistency, decides his racket is to blame and rushes to his chair to get another one. It makes little difference on the next point, as Dimitrov gets to 40-0. Medvedev reduces his arrears to 40-15 but gets no further, because Dimitrov dispatches a ferocious forehand down the line before charging forward to emphatically smash away Medvedev\u2019s reply. That\u2019s three games on the spin for Dimitrov from 2-0 down. First set: Medvedev 2-2 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) At 15-0, Medvedev is skipping and split stepping his way along the baseline, showing no signs of the physical problems that affected him against Wawrinka. It felt as if he\u2019d had medical attention to practically every part of his body by the end of that quarter-final. Despite Medvedev\u2019s sprightliness, Dimitrov is staying with the Russian, and has another couple of break points to add to the ones he had in Medvedev\u2019s opening service game. This time he gets the job done after a face-off at the net. We\u2019re back on serve. First set: Medvedev* 2-1 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) There\u2019s a speaker malfunction at 15-all, just as Dimitrov is about to serve. It perhaps puts the Bulgarian off his first serve \u2013 but he makes the second and then comes out on top in his best point of the match so far. Cue the biggest cheer of the match so far. The crowd have nailed their colours firmly to the mast already. 30-15. 40-15. And Dimitrov holds with a stinging first serve, which Medvedev gets a racket to but can only slap into the net. First set: Medvedev 2-0 Dimitrov* (*denotes next server) But Medvedev is feeling the nerves too. Soon it\u2019s 15-40, two break-back points, courtesy of two double faults. Dimitrov decides to seize the initiative on the first, fizzing a forehand down the line before sprinting into the net, but Medvedev pulls off the pass. A strong first serve \u2013 only Medvedev\u2019s second of the game \u2013 and Dimitrov can\u2019t get that back into play. Deuce. Advantage Medvedev. Game Medvedev, when Dimitrov chops a harmless slice well long. First set: Medvedev* 1-0 Dimitrov (*denotes next server) Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019re ready to play, so please take your seats. Dimitrov is serving first \u2013 and promptly sends his first delivery into the net. He makes the second serve, and a lengthy rally ensues, 20 shots in total, with both players just feeling each other out, unwilling to pull the trigger. Medvedev prevails. 0-15. Dimitrov then drills out for 0-30. And then it\u2019s 0-40, when Hawk-Eye confirms Dimitrov\u2019s effort missed by about a millimetre. So already a triple break point ... and Dimitrov disappointingly wafts wide. Does the Bulgarian have the belief to win this match? The early signs suggest perhaps he has doubts. Two minutes to go. So there\u2019s just enough time to talk tactics. You might think Medvedev would play a game of all-out aggression given his 6ft 6in frame, but he\u2019s more Djokovician in style, playing a game of defence and offence, based on his excellent movement. If he\u2019s feeling well physically, he\u2019ll try to grind Dimitrov down in lengthy rallies, so Dimitrov will need to be aggressive, come to the net, and mix it up by showing all the talent he possesses but has not always shown. However in the quarter-finals an injured Medvedev shortened the points, rushed the net and took the ball early, which upset Wawrinka \u2013 and a similar approach today could also be disorientating for Dimitrov. Tik, tok, tikity, tok, they\u2019re warming up. Despite it being only 4.14pm in New York, this feels as if it\u2019s a night match given how dark it is. The atmosphere is also pretty rowdy under the roof. Here they come. No prizes for guessing who receives the warmest welcome. Dimitrov steps on to court first to applause, before Medvedev gets a mix of cheers of boos. But the jeers won\u2019s be ringing in the Russian\u2019s ears. He seems to love being the villain. Exhibit A: Exhibit B: Ho hum. No sign of the players yet. The crowd are instead being treated to blaring music and lots of flashing lights. Wimbledon this isn\u2019t. Stat attack. Dimitrov is the lowest-ranked grand slam semi-finalist since Germany\u2019s Rainer Sch\u00fcttler, then 94th in the world, reached the last four at Wimbledon in 2008. This is the first time at a slam that three of the semi-finalists were born in the 1990s. If Medvedev or Dimitrov go on to win the title, it\u2019ll be the first time someone outside of tennis\u2019s great triumvirate has won a major since Stan Wawrinka at the US Open three years ago. Dimitrov says: Despite the fact I was losing very tough matches, close matches against players that I shouldn\u2019t lose [to], yet I did, I kept on believing in the process, kept on working, kept on trying to improve whatever else I had to improve. I really controlled the things I could. Sometimes the most simple things are hardest. It was not a pretty time. I\u2019m not going to lie. It was that low that I don\u2019t even want to go there any more. It was just obviously injury, losing points, ranking. That\u2019s the lowest point of any player. The past six, seven months have been pretty rough. But I had somebody to lean on, my friends, my family. I kept on believing in the work, the rehab I had to put behind my shoulder, the exercise, the practice. There were so many things I had to adjust. Next thing you know, you\u2019re almost end of the year, you have a result like that. It\u2019s pretty special to me. Medvedev says: Usually I\u2019m not like this, as I was in the third-round match. I\u2019m not proud of it. I\u2019m working to be better. Hopefully I can show the bright side of myself. I am surprised. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been working for all my life, especially the last two and a half years. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve been going step by step. I was improving my rankings. But I am still really surprised with the way this last four weeks have been going ... that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been working for. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve dreamed of. Some pre-match reading and viewing: The scene in New York: is very, very wet. But fear not. There\u2019s the humongous roof. They\u2019ll be under way on time. Hello and welcome to our coverage of the first men\u2019s semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer sorry Daniil Medvedev and Grigor Dimitrov. The question at the start of the tournament was how to solve a problem like breaking the hegemony of the Big Three. Now we have two-thirds of the answer: wait for Djokovic to be cut down by a shoulder injury in the last 16 and then let the man formerly known as Baby Federer take out the actual and ailing Federer over five sets in the quarter-finals. Of course Rafael Nadal is still standing, and is looking in ominous form before his semi-final later against the brave or perhaps foolhardy Matteo Berrettini, but Medvedev or Dimitrov will have to leave that last part of the problem until another day. First they must face off for a place in their debut grand slam final. For the 23-year-old Medvedev, this is his first major semi-final; for the 28-year-old Dimitrov, this is his third in a career that hasn\u2019t lived up to its tremendous promise. While Medvedev arrived in New York as the man of the hardcourt summer, having defeated Djokovic en route to the Cincinnati title and reached the Washington and Montreal finals, Dimitrov was the forgotten man. The former world No 3 entered this tournament down at 78th after an awful, injury-affected season in which he had lost seven of his past eight matches, including to the world No 405 six weeks ago. But Dimitrov\u2019s victory over Federer from two sets to one down was a comeback in more ways than one. Rarely have there been such remarkable turnarounds in form. Despite taking out Federer, Dimitrov will have the crowd on his side against Medvedev, whose summer of success has not exactly turned into one of love. The quirky and controversial Russian, carrying an ever-increasing number of injuries after his exertions of late, has defiantly moved through the draw amid a chorus of boos, which started in the third round when he snatched a towel from a ballboy, gave spectators the middle finger and then trolled them in his on-court interview. The jeers and sarcastic retorts have continued since. But after Medvedev\u2019s superb six weeks, during which he has risen to fourth in the rankings behind Djokovic, Nadal and Federer \u2013 or \u201cthe No 1 among mere mortals\u201d as my colleague Tumaini Carayol writes \u2013 it would be a shame if he didn\u2019t let his tennis do the talking in the biggest match of his life. The players will be on court at: 4pm New York time/9pm BST.",

      "bodyText": "Catherine Tyldesley admits her husband is getting ribbed about it, Will Bayley has no such fears because, he says, he\u2019s \u201ctoo ugly\u201d, while James Cracknell is more concerned about his lack of dancing skills. The ex-Coronation street actor, Paralympian and retired Olympic rower are among 15 contestants about to submit themselves to not only the 17th season of Strictly Come Dancing, but also its so-called curse: the risk of the end of a relationship as a result of becoming romantically linked with a dance partner. After having the phenomenon explained to him, the Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing said: \u201cOh no, everyone\u2019s going to become pregnant?\u201d Laing will avoid any trouble after being forced to pull out this week with an injury, although he will appear on Saturday night because the opening show is pre-recorded. The idea of a curse might be funnier if it hadn\u2019t happened so often. Tyldesley admitted it had been a topic of conversation with her husband, Tom Pitfield. \u201cTom has got a WhatsApp group with all his mates. A lot of them are rugby players so there is a lot of banter going on. They are all like: \u2018Oh mate, you\u2019re screwed.\u2019 But he\u2019s just like: \u2018Whatevs.\u2019 It\u2019s not something \u2026 we\u2019re happily married. It\u2019s [the curse] a bizarre thing isn\u2019t it?\u201d In previous years, Cracknell was reportedly asked by his then wife not to sign up because of curse fears.

Asked about the risk, this year\u2019s comedian contestant Chris Ramsey turned the question into a promotional opportunity. \u201cMe and my wife have been married for five years, we\u2019ve got a child, but more importantly, me and my wife have got one of the top podcasts in the UK and if you think I\u2019m jeopardising that for any kind of fling you\u2019ve got another think coming.\u201d Every year, Strictly viewers complain they have not heard of the YouTubers, DJs and soap stars who regularly make up the roster of celebrities.

      "body": "<p>There are two movies playing out within Waves, the third offering from the rising indie wunderkind Trey Edward Shults, perhaps not surprising to anyone familiar with his previous two efforts. In Krisha, an uneasy Thanksgiving reunion oscillated between exploring a tense family drama and the unravelling psyche of an unstable older woman. In It Comes at Night, a viral outbreak led to both a grim post-apocalyptic morality tale and a nightmarish body horror. Both films are the work of an ambitious, often audacious film-maker tasking himself with a great deal but effortlessly rising to the challenge and with his latest film, already lauded at this year\u2019s Telluride film festival, he\u2019s aiming for something even bigger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/06/shia-labeouf-honey-boy-review\">Honey Boy review \u2013 Shia LaBeouf turns therapy into big-screen drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr) is an 18-year-old nearing the end of high school with pressure from all angles. His father (Sterling K Brown) is a well-meaning disciplinarian who wants the best for him even if that means pushing him to his limits. His girlfriend (Alexa Demie) loves him but is concerned about their future after some troubling news. His school life demands him to be both adept in the classroom as well as agile on the wrestling mat. But his shoulder is hurting, more than he\u2019s willing to admit, and he\u2019s not sleeping enough, a hectic schedule that\u2019s proving harder and harder to maintain. So he pops the odd prescription pill now and again, just to ease things a little, a casual habit that slowly grows out of control.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5z3cr8AB5g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V5z3cr8AB5g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Waves begins with such confidence and bombast that I found myself gripped to the seat, transfixed both by Shults\u2019s bravura film-making and also by Harrison\u2019s barnstorming performance. It\u2019s best to limit your knowledge of what happens before you take a seat, much of the film\u2019s growing unease tied to wondering exactly where Tyler is taking us. We\u2019re sure it\u2019s nowhere good but the specifics are best kept in the dark as Shults plays on our fears with horrifying precision. The majority of the first half is almost unbearably stressful, a sensory overload matched with raw, devastating work from Harrison, who played another student troubled by the pressure of black excellence in this year\u2019s haunting thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/26/luce-review-tough-provocative-thriller-naomi-watts-tim-roth\">Luce</a>. He invests us in Tyler\u2019s downfall even as his behaviour becomes harder to support and when Shults keeps his uncomfortably tight focus on him, the film soars.</p> <p>But when tragedy strikes, with half of the film left, Shults switches gears. To explain the hows and whys would be a spoiler but the lens moves to Tyler\u2019s sister, played by the extremely engaging Taylor Russell, who falls for an awkward fellow student, played by an infinitely charming Lucas Hedges. Their scenes have a certain sweetness but the tonal shift is so severe and the first half of the film so deeply affecting that the film never really recovers. The ferocious foreboding turns into something far limper and the much more familiar drama that unfolds feels pedestrian in comparison. I was so wrapped up in the first half that I found myself trying to force myself back on track after it started to derail but the script\u2019s undercooked family dynamic and simplistic philosophy gave me little to hold on to.

      "bodyText": "There are two movies playing out within Waves, the third offering from the rising indie wunderkind Trey Edward Shults, perhaps not surprising to anyone familiar with his previous two efforts. In Krisha, an uneasy Thanksgiving reunion oscillated between exploring a tense family drama and the unravelling psyche of an unstable older woman. In It Comes at Night, a viral outbreak led to both a grim post-apocalyptic morality tale and a nightmarish body horror. Both films are the work of an ambitious, often audacious film-maker tasking himself with a great deal but effortlessly rising to the challenge and with his latest film, already lauded at this year\u2019s Telluride film festival, he\u2019s aiming for something even bigger. Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr) is an 18-year-old nearing the end of high school with pressure from all angles. His father (Sterling K Brown) is a well-meaning disciplinarian who wants the best for him even if that means pushing him to his limits. His girlfriend (Alexa Demie) loves him but is concerned about their future after some troubling news. His school life demands him to be both adept in the classroom as well as agile on the wrestling mat. But his shoulder is hurting, more than he\u2019s willing to admit, and he\u2019s not sleeping enough, a hectic schedule that\u2019s proving harder and harder to maintain. So he pops the odd prescription pill now and again, just to ease things a little, a casual habit that slowly grows out of control. Waves begins with such confidence and bombast that I found myself gripped to the seat, transfixed both by Shults\u2019s bravura film-making and also by Harrison\u2019s barnstorming performance. It\u2019s best to limit your knowledge of what happens before you take a seat, much of the film\u2019s growing unease tied to wondering exactly where Tyler is taking us. We\u2019re sure it\u2019s nowhere good but the specifics are best kept in the dark as Shults plays on our fears with horrifying precision. The majority of the first half is almost unbearably stressful, a sensory overload matched with raw, devastating work from Harrison, who played another student troubled by the pressure of black excellence in this year\u2019s haunting thriller Luce. He invests us in Tyler\u2019s downfall even as his behaviour becomes harder to support and when Shults keeps his uncomfortably tight focus on him, the film soars. But when tragedy strikes, with half of the film left, Shults switches gears. To explain the hows and whys would be a spoiler but the lens moves to Tyler\u2019s sister, played by the extremely engaging Taylor Russell, who falls for an awkward fellow student, played by an infinitely charming Lucas Hedges. Their scenes have a certain sweetness but the tonal shift is so severe and the first half of the film so deeply affecting that the film never really recovers. The ferocious foreboding turns into something far limper and the much more familiar drama that unfolds feels pedestrian in comparison. I was so wrapped up in the first half that I found myself trying to force myself back on track after it started to derail but the script\u2019s undercooked family dynamic and simplistic philosophy gave me little to hold on to. What\u2019s inarguable throughout, however, is Shults\u2019s aesthetic ability, and Waves is one of the most visually startling films I\u2019ve seen all year. There\u2019s experimentation and verve behind every scene construction, and while he does tend to rely a little too heavily on an admittedly standout soundtrack to carry the film\u2019s emotional weight, I was left in little doubt of his ability as an artist. So there are two films here: one is frightening and poignant and the other tender but slight. The first one will haunt me even if the second will fade. Waves is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 1 November, with a UK date yet to be announced",

Her 24 year-old daughter Natori, was along side her clinging to branches as well. </p> \n   <p>Her face and arms still bear the dry, bloody cuts of her hours exposed to the 185 mph winds. The pair eventually lost their grip but were swept close to a nearby home that had withstood the hurricane\u2019s devastation. They got inside. </p> \n   <p>\u201cBy the grace of God we made it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are survivors.\u201d </p> \n   <p>The 41-year-old has not yet heard from seven of her close family: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All still missing. In this community of around 600, two people have been confirmed dead but at least 20 have not been heard from since Dorian spent almost two days destroying almost every building in sight. </p> \n   <p>\u201cWe need aid. We have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently,\u201d she said. </p> \n   <p>Parts of the road in to High Rock have been stripped of tarmac, leaving piles of rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swim. Broken pylons dangle in the street. The palms are bent at 45 degrees, their leaves shaved off by the wind. </p> \n   <p>Aid has only just begun to reach these more remote parts of the island. </p> \n   <p>The storm surge here rose to around 20 feet. Wind gusts were recorded at 220 mph. Many who have lived in this area, about half a mile from the sea, for generations, said the brutality of the storm was something they have never seen or heard of before.</p> \n   <p>For Roberts, who worked at a nearby casino \u2013 also obliterated \u2013 the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it rapidly intensified to a category 5 and stood still over the island for over 24 hours, has an obvious explanation. </p> \n   <p>\u201cI think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,\u201d she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed family home she had now taken shelter in. \u201cThe severity of this\u2026 it\u2019s global warming.\u201d </p> \n   <p>\u201cI\u2019ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I\u2019ve always been committed.

However, severe flooding is causing delays.

It ain\u2019t livable for nobody. Only animals can live here.\u2019</em></p> \n   <p><em>At the port, some of those who lined up behind a yellow cloth tape arrived as early as 1 a.m., hoping to get to Nassau.</em></p> \n   <p><em>\u2018It\u2019s going to get crazy soon,\u2019 said Serge Simon, 39, who drives an ice truck and waited with his wife and two sons, 5 months old and 4. \u2018There\u2019s no food, no water.

      "bodyText": "Summary We\u2019re logging off here, but our reporters in the Bahamas and North Carolina will continue our Dorian coverage this weekend. Here\u2019s a wrap up of everything that happened today: The storm battered parts of North Carolina after the center of the hurricane hit the far eastern coasts of the state. The state\u2019s Outer Banks were particularly hit hard with severe flooding and winds. The storm is now expected to make its way to Nova Scotia in Canada over the weekend. More light has been shed on the wreckage Dorian left behind in the Bahamas. The death toll is still at 30 people, but the Bahamian health minister says the public will need to prepare for \u201cunimaginable information about the death toll\u201d as it continues to rise. Aid has slowly been making its way to the islands. The United Nations said that about 70,000 people are in need of life-saving assistance on Grand Bahama and Abaco islands. The UN ordered eight tons of ready-to-eat meals, and crews have begun clearing streets and setting up aid distribution centers. Oil leakage seen on the shore of Grand Bahama Island Fears are growing that damage to a major oil storage terminal on the shore of Grand Bahama Island could cause oil to leak into the ocean, potentially damaging reefs and wildlife off the coast. Dorian blew the tops off five crude-storage tanks at the South Riding Point oil storage terminal on the southeastern end of the island, causing oil to seep into the ground. Equinor, the Norwegian energy company that owns the terminal, wrote in a press release yesterday that oil had been observed on the ground outside of the tanks, though there were no immediate observations of oil in the sea. The company said that while it has informed local authorities of the situation, \u201croad conditions and flooding continue to impact our ability to assess the situation\u201d. Sam Teicher, \u201cchief reef officer\u201d for Coral Vita, a local company that works to protect the island\u2019s reefs, told NPR the tanks were \u201ccovered with oil slick, and there were slicks going well around the facility and out into the road and forest\u201d, adding that he saw a few workers assessing the damage, but \u201cvery few people have been able to even get out to that point\u201d. The Canadian Hurricane Centre just upgrade its hurricane watch for most of Nova Scotia to a hurricane warning. The storm is projected to make its way to the Canadian province around Saturday afternoon with conditions lasting until Sunday morning. The Outer Banks on the eastern edge of North Carolina received the worst the storm brought to the United States. More than 200,000 residents of the state experienced power outages today. The storm has been making an exit into the Atlantic this afternoon, sparing North Carolina from further damage. While the beating is nothing compared to the brutal storm that devastated the Bahamas, here\u2019s what parts of North Carolina saw today: Eighteen members of Florida\u2019s Congressional delegation have called on President Trump to waive visa requirements for Bahamians seeking shelter after Hurricane Dorian. The delegation joins the state\u2019s two senators, Republicans Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, who on Wednesday wrote a similar letter to Trump highlighting the need for \u201cshelter and reunification with family in the United States\u201d. Approximately 20,000 Bahamians live in South Florida. Florida is threatened by storms each and every year, and Floridians have close ties to the Bahamas. Now, lawmakers are reckoning with the help the people of the Abaco islands will need to recover. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland) is on Grand Bahama Island today talking to survivors of the storm. He has been able to reach a remote part of the island via ship, here\u2019s his latest dispatch: As Erica Roberts clung to a tall mango tree, the winds and sea water churned up by hurricane Dorian pounding her face, a single thought ran through her head: \u201cI will not die like this\u201d. Her home, in the small town of High Rock on the eastern side of Grand Bahama Island, had already been swept away. Her 24 year-old daughter Natori, was along side her clinging to branches as well. Her face and arms still bear the dry, bloody cuts of her hours exposed to the 185 mph winds. The pair eventually lost their grip but were swept close to a nearby home that had withstood the hurricane\u2019s devastation. They got inside. \u201cBy the grace of God we made it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are survivors.\u201d The 41-year-old has not yet heard from seven of her close family: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All still missing. In this community of around 600, two people have been confirmed dead but at least 20 have not been heard from since Dorian spent almost two days destroying almost every building in sight. \u201cWe need aid. We have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently,\u201d she said. Parts of the road in to High Rock have been stripped of tarmac, leaving piles of rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swim. Broken pylons dangle in the street. The palms are bent at 45 degrees, their leaves shaved off by the wind. Aid has only just begun to reach these more remote parts of the island. The storm surge here rose to around 20 feet. Wind gusts were recorded at 220 mph. Many who have lived in this area, about half a mile from the sea, for generations, said the brutality of the storm was something they have never seen or heard of before. For Roberts, who worked at a nearby casino \u2013 also obliterated \u2013 the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it rapidly intensified to a category 5 and stood still over the island for over 24 hours, has an obvious explanation. \u201cI think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,\u201d she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed family home she had now taken shelter in. \u201cThe severity of this\u2026 it\u2019s global warming.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I\u2019ve always been committed. But the world is not.\u201d The Bahamian Health Ministry said helicopters and ships are on the way to Abaco and Grand Bahama , two islands which suffered the worst of the storm, to provide aid and transport. However, severe flooding is causing delays. At least 30 people have been killed by the hurricane, but officials expect it to rise. Survivors of Dorian are gathering at a port in Abaco, hoping aid and transportation off the island is coming their way. A new dispatch from the Associated Press paints the scene: Carrying their meager possessions in duffel bags and shopping carts, hundreds of desperate storm victims gathered at the port in Grand Abaco on Friday in hopes of getting off the hurricane-devastated island, amid signs of rising frustration over the pace of the disaster-relief effort. \u2018It\u2019s chaos here,\u2019 said Gee Rolle, a 44-year-old construction worker who waited with his wife for a boat that could take them to the capital, Nassau. \u2018The government is trying their best, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing a good enough job to evacuate the people. It ain\u2019t livable for nobody. Only animals can live here.\u2019 At the port, some of those who lined up behind a yellow cloth tape arrived as early as 1 a.m., hoping to get to Nassau. \u2018It\u2019s going to get crazy soon,\u2019 said Serge Simon, 39, who drives an ice truck and waited with his wife and two sons, 5 months old and 4. \u2018There\u2019s no food, no water. There are bodies in the water. People are going to start getting sick.\u2019 A quick update on Dorian\u2019s location In its most recent update, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said a Weatherflow station in North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks reported wind gusts of 98 mph and sustained winds of 83mph. The storm was about 50 miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where the eye of the hurricane hit earlier today. It was roughly 460 miles off the southwest coast of Nantucket in Massachusetts. Dorian is projected to move further away from the US coast today, moving toward Canada. The NHC said its moving toward the northeast at 17mph, and is expected to increase in speed through Saturday. Climate crisis \u201cHurricane Dorian makes Bahamians the latest climate crisis victims,\u201d tweets Climate Reality, the advocacy group founded by Al \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d Gore, former Veep and early environment and climate activist. The tweet echoes the headline of and links to an opinion piece in the New York Times. It\u2019s not certain whether Dorian will still be whirling with hurricane force when it continues its track over the next 24 hours or so and arrives in Canada. But one keen weather watcher reckons it will. Winds still at 90mph this hour. Ann Warner stayed on her home on Ocracoke Island, in the Outer Banks, a string of islands off the coast of North Carolina, as Dorian made landfall there this morning, the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt writes. \u201cWithin 10 minutes it went from nothing to catastrophic flooding. We were prepared but not for this amount of water,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe have been through many hurricanes. This one just came fast with the storm surge.\u201d Warner, who owns Howard\u2019s Pub on Ocracoke, rode out the storm with her son, Blackburn, and his dog, Rocky. She posted a series of videos to her Facebook page showing water swirling around the base of her house \u2013 it would eventually enter her first floor. \u201cWe are safe,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cHowever Ocracoke Island had significant storm surge - the most we have experienced before.\u201d Warner said water had also made it into \u201cmany\u201d homes that \u201chave never had storm surge\u201d before. \u201cThe wind is still strong and water, while going down, is still extremely high,\u201d she said at 11am. The Outer Banks was under an evacuation order but many locals consider that more a message for tourists than those who\u2019ve lived and ridden out storms here for years. Warner said the water was higher than during Hurricane Matthew, a category 5 hurricane that devastated Haiti and had a dramatic impact on the south-eastern US in 2007. The links between the Carolinas, powerful hurricanes and the climate crisis were explored earlier this summer in a Guardian article. Here\u2019s a tweet from the National Weather Service\u2019s Newport/Morehead arm on the North Carolina coast. Bahamian health minister Duane Sands has warned of the probability of a very high death toll in Abaco and Grand Bahama as the catastrophe continues to unfold. He told people to brace for a \u201cstaggering\u201d final count, when speaking to local radio late Thursday. \u201cThe public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,\u201d he said. The International Red Cross has estimated that almost half of homes on Grand Bahama have been wrecked, amid huge areas of flooding. There are fears of looting by survivors, now that the 200mph+ winds and the cascading rainfall and crashing seas have abated. Grand Abaco is said to be virtually uninhabitable. The official death toll is still 30, but is expected to climb steeply as services reach the most stricken areas. Emergency officials are fanned out across stricken areas of the northern reaches of the Bahamas to track down people who are still missing or in distress. Crews have begun clearing streets and setting up aid distribution centers. The United Nations has announced the purchase of eight tons of ready-to-eat meals, the Associated Press writes, and said it will provide satellite communications equipment and airlift storage units, generators and prefab offices to set up logistics hubs. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said about 70,000 people \u201care in immediate need of life-saving assistance\u201d on Grand Bahama and Abaco. A British Royal Navy ship has docked at Abaco and distributed supplies to hurricane survivors. On Grand Bahama, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship dropped off 10,000 meals, 10,000 bottles of water and more than 180 generators, as well as diapers and flashlights. American Airlines said it flew a Boeing 737 from Miami to Nassau to drop off 14,000lbs of relief supplies. The airline is also giving frequent-flyer points to customers who donate at least $25 to the Red Cross. Troops from the Rhode Island National Guard will be heading to the Bahamas on Friday to help. Thousands of desperate people are still seeking help in Dorian\u2019s aftermath. With winds of 185mph, the hurricane obliterated more than 13,000 houses on the Abaco and Grand Bahama islands. Crews in Grand Bahama worked to reopen the airport and used heavy equipment to pick up branches and palm fronds. Lines formed outside gas stations and grocery stores. \u201cPeople will be out of jobs for months,\u201d 67-year-old wood carver Gordon Higgs lamented. \u201cThey\u2019ll be homeless, no food. Nothing.\u201d Total property losses, not including infrastructure and autos, could reach $7bn, the firm Karen Clark &amp; Co estimated. On Thursday, medical officials moved hundreds of people left homeless by the storm out of the main hospital in Abaco to shelters in schools and other government buildings. At the Leonard M. Thompson airport, Rashad Reckley, a 30-year-old saxophonist, played the Bob Marley song Three Little Birds for people who had lost their homes. \u201cI want to lift up everybody\u2019s spirits after all the tragedy that happened,\u201d said Reckley, who said he had exhausted his repertoire after playing for hours. \u201cThey want me to play more. But I can\u2019t think of songs to play.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt spent last night in North Carolina, as the region was battered by the outer bands of the hurricane. It made landfall Friday morning at Cape Hatteras. He was in the area during the 2018 hurricane season, too. Wilmington, North Carolina, suffered more than most places at the hands of Hurricane Florence last year. The city is on the bank of the Cape Fear River, about 15 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, and as Florence dumped record-breaking rainfall Wilmington was cut off entirely from the rest of the mainland by floodwater, with no access in or out for days. Unsurprisingly, people here feared the worst as Dorian approached. On Thursday afternoon businesses along Wilmington\u2019s main street were boarded up, and the streets deserted. Residents hunkered down inside as the storm trundled along the coast \u2013 some residents took refuge in a bar that had remained open despite Dorian\u2019s impending arrival. On Friday morning, however, the worst fears proved to have been unfounded. There was a howling gale in Wilmington, but the rain had stopped and by 8.30am the sun was breaking through the clouds. I\u2019m staying in an apartment building looking out onto the Cape Fear river. A US Coast Guard ship is moored right outside, and hasn\u2019t moved since Thursday evening \u2013 a good sign. Even closer to the coast, residents of the popular tourist spots of Carolina Beach and Kure Beach were under mandatory evacuation orders on Thursday, but those areas also appeared to have missed the worst of the storm. Local television crews reported some minor damage to buildings, but as with Wilmington, the overriding emotion was one of relief. The three Republican musketeers of Florida, Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott and governor Ron DeSantis, are heading to the disaster zone in the Bahamas to see how they can help. Interestingly, they are coming around to the idea these days that the human-spurred climate crisis is kinda very real and already affecting Florida, with much worse consequences to come (if dramatic action isn\u2019t taken). Here\u2019s a listicle from more than four years ago about Rubio\u2019s climate change skepticism. If Florida had taken more action then......meanwhile, experts say global heating is increasing the intensity and frequency of monster hurricanes, which hit the Bahamas most fiercely this time, but a week ago had been feared to be heading close to Miami. Marco Rubio is evolving on climate change. Not a minute too soon. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland is now on Grand Bahama island and will file a dispatch later today. Here is the report, updated this morning, from Nassau, in conjunction with the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt, who spent the night in Wilmington, North Carolina, as Dorian howled in. Hurricane Dorian\u2019s flood waters surpassed the floor boards, already five feet off the ground, so Freeport banana-farm owner Alpha Celestin, 61, busted a hole in his ceiling, propped a ladder there and climbed inside with two of his workers, the Miami Herald writes this morning, in a dispatch from Freeport, Grand Bahama. The venerable daily paper reports that the degree of destruction on the northern reaches of the Bahamas is \u201cunimaginable\u201d. The article continues that Celestin knew the other men couldn\u2019t swim, so he tied Styrofoam from his ceiling around their chests to keep them afloat. They stayed perched there for 48 hours. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever come so close to death, like I was watching death in the eye,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cI never knew of such a hurricane.\u201d \u201cEveryone expected to pull a dead body from that house,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I called they were very happy.\u201d Read the full report here. A few meager possessions stuffed in plastic bags, some of the haggard Bahamians who lost homes to the ravages of Hurricane Dorian are waiting at a small airport hoping to catch planes out of the disaster zone as an international humanitarian effort to help the Caribbean country gains momentum and the official death toll has risen to 30, the Associated Press writes. A few hundred people sat at the partl- flooded Leonard M. Thompson airport on Abaco island later yesterday, as small planes picked up the most vulnerable survivors, including the sick and the elderly. The evacuation was slow and there was frustration for some who said they had nowhere to go after the category 5 hurricane splintered whole neighborhoods. \u201cThey told us that the babies, the pregnant people and the elderly people were supposed to be first preference,\u201d said Lukya Thompson, a 23-year-old bartender. But many were still waiting, she said. Despite hardship and uncertainty, those at the airport were mostly calm. The Bahamian health ministry said helicopters and boats were on the way to help people in affected areas, though officials warned of delays because of severe flooding and limited access. At least 30 people died in the hurricane and the number could be \u201csignificantly higher,\u201d Bahamian health minister Duane Sands told The Associated Press in a telephone interview late Thursday. The victims are from Abaco and Grand Bahama islands and include some who died from injuries after being flown to New Providence island, he said. The hurricane hit Abaco on Sunday and then hovered over Grand Bahama for a day and a half. Hurricane Dorian\u2019s coming ashore at Cape Hatteras this morning marks the first landfall since the storm reluctantly departed the Bahamian archipelago, after hitting the northern reaches of the Bahamas over the weekend. So after much trepidation all the way up the east coast of Florida, into Georgia and South Carolina (don\u2019t mention Alabama), Dorian has made its initial and likely only US landfall on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks barrier islands. Flooding is happening there now, with reports of inundation on the small island of Ocracoke. Ocracoke is towards the southern end of the wafer-thin barrier islands, offshore from where the Pamlico, Bay and Neuse rivers reach the ocean in North Carolina. Stand by for fuller reports about the Outer Banks and a dispatch from our man in Wilmington shortly, while we take the opportunity meanwhile to update you on the disastrous situation in parts of the Bahamas. Dangerous winds Having just made landfall at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, Dorian is spinning up the Atlantic Coast with winds up to 95mph. Cape Lookout reported one-minute sustained winds of 81 mph, with a gust of 94 mph early Friday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Tropical-storm-force wind, meaning it\u2019s over 39mph, is now blowing up to 220 miles from the center of the storm. Hurricane-force winds mean speeds over 74mph and they are shrieking along up to 45 miles from the center. Good Morning, weather watchers. With Hurricane Dorian still upon us, we\u2019ll continue to follow its progress and effects moment to moment today. We have correspondents on location in North Carolina and on Grand Bahama, as well as our team keeping vigil at Guardian US HQ in New York, and we will bring you updates on the Atlantic coast and the Bahamas as they arise. Dorian is still a category 1 hurricane and is currently shrieking up the barrier islands off the north-eastern part of North Carolina. The storm\u2019s eye is 10 miles off Cape Hatteras, moving north-east at 14 mph. It is expected to continue at hurricane strength up the eastern seaboard, into tomorrow. Conditions ranging from flood risk in North Carolina and Virginia to heavy surf in New England are on the cards. The official death toll in the Bahamas so far is 30, but there is a tragic expectation of that possibly rising into the hundreds as the full impact of Dorian, which sat over Abaco and Grand Bahama as a category 5 on Sunday and Monday, continues to unfold. Many in the Carolinas had a sleepless night as howling winds and sideways rain pounded coastal areas, following some tornados whipped up by Dorian. Curfews in many areas lifted this morning and the extent of any damage and injury will become clearer. So far, four people are thought to have succumbed to storm-related death in the US.",

As for the visitors at Hampden Park, Artem Dyzuba spearheads the Russia attack, as it feels he has done for the past couple of decades; no player has been involved in more goals in Euro 2020 qualifying than the Zenit striker (five goals, two assists), scoring more goals than Scotland have managed so far as a team (four).</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T18:07:09.868Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d729b388f08143ee1ae18fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T17:54:12.477Z\">6.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Germany v Netherlands</h2> <p>Germany (3-4-3): Neuer; S\u00fcle, Tah, Ginter; Klostermann, Kimmich, Kroos, Schulz; Gnabry, Werner, Reus</p> <p><em>Subs: Leno, Ter Stegen, Hector, Havertz, Brandt, Halstenberg, Stark, Waldschmidt, </em><em>G\u00fcndogan</em><em>, Can</em></p> <p>Netherlands: Cillessen; Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Blind; De Roon, Wijnaldum, F De Jong; Promes, Depay, Babel<br></p> <p><em>Subs: Zoet, Veltman, </em><em>Ak\u00e9</em><em>, </em><em>Pr\u00f6pper</em><em>, Malen, Van Aanholt, Berghuis, Strootman, Vilhena, L De Jong, Kluivert, Vermeer</em></p> <h2>Scotland v Russia</h2> <p>Scotland (4-3-3): Marshall, O\u2019Donnell, Cooper, Mulgrew, Robertson; McTominay, McGinn, Forrest; Fraser, McBurnie, McGregor</p> <p><em>Subs: McLaughlin, MacGillivray, Bates, Jack, Devlin, McLean, Snodgrass, Armstrong, Phillips, Christie, Russell, Taylor</em></p> <p>Russia (4-2-3-1): Guilherme; Fernandes, Semyonov, Dzhikiya, Kudryashov; Ozdoyev, Zobnin; Ionov, Golovin, Zhirkov; Dzyuba</p> <p><em>Subs: Neustadter, Belyayev, Cheryshev, Barinov, Smolov, Akhmetov, Lunyov, Karavayev, Dzhankayev, Miranchuk, Yerokhin, Petrov</em></p> <h2>Wales v Azerbaijan</h2> <p>Wales (4-2-3-1): Hennessey; Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Taylor; Allen, Ampadu; James, T Lawrence, Wilson; Bale</p> <p><em>Subs: Ward, A Davies, Gunter, B Davies, Smith, Vokes, Moore, J Lawrence, Lockyer, Williams, Morrell, Vaulks</em></p> <p>Azerbaijan (4-2-3-1): Agayev; Pashayev, Medvedev, Mustafazade, Krivotsyuk; De Oliveira, Qarayev; Emreli, Nazarov, Rehimov; Sheydayev </p> <p><em>Subs: Abdullayev, Mahmudov, Ramazonov, Balayev, Eyyubov, Buludov, Ru Dadashov, Re Dadashov, Khalilzada, Huseynov, Mehemmedeliyev</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T18:00:02.319Z\">at 7.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7236548f08143ee1ae1378\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T17:38:44.703Z\">6.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is actually quite big. It is an evening whereby Scotland enter must-win territory if they have any designs of gatecrashing the Euro 2020 party and Wales badly need to jumpstart their own qualifying campaign, with serious questions beginning to be asked of Ryan Giggs, who remains something of a rookie manager. Then there is the small matter of old foes Germany against the Netherlands in Group C, currently topped by Northern Ireland, who welcome Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side to Belfast on Monday.</p> <p>Scotland have to navigate a way past Russia at Hampden Park, while Wales need to get back on track after successive defeats and given Azerbaijan have not won a European qualifier away from Baku in 31 attempts, everything points towards victory for Giggs\u2019s side in Cardiff. Wales are desperate to close the gap to Group E leaders Hungary, while Croatia and Slovakia are also ahead of them. Azerbaijan, who have conceded 10 goals in three qualifiers, are managed by Slaven Bilic\u2019s former assistant, Nikola Jurcevic. Scotland take on Russia, who are second placed in Group I, with leaders Belgium taking on San Marino. Steve Clarke\u2019s side kick-off six points off the pace but there are reasons to be cheerful in Glasgow, with the Scots having won their past five competitive matches on home soil. \u201cIt\u2019s about time that we as a nation, rather than being on the receiving end, are dishing out a result that\u2019s deemed an upset,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cHopefully Friday can be the case.\u201d</p> <p>As for that tantalising match-up in Hamburg, Ronald Koeman has been at pains to play down the significance of yielding victory. \u201cThe duel with Germany is not a key match,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cWe have to get 12 points against Estonia and Belarus and be better in the two games with Northern Ireland.\u201d Elsewhere, Gareth Southgate and Marcus Rashford have been speaking at Wembley ahead of England\u2019s game with Bulgaria, while, for the Under-21s, the road to Hungary and Slovakia for Euro 2021 begins. Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s side are in action in Turkey. Eddie Nketiah, Phil Foden, Ryan Sessegnon and Max Aarons all start in Izmit. </p> <h2>Euro 2020 qualifying fixtures</h2> <p><strong>Group C<br></strong>Estonia 1-2 Belarus (FT)<br>Germany v Netherlands</p> <p><strong>Group E<br></strong></p> <p>Slovakia v Croatia<br>Wales v Azerbaijan</p> <p><strong>Group G<br></strong></p> <p>Austria v Latvia<br>Slovenia v Poland</p> <p><strong>Group I <br></strong></p> <p>Cyprus 1-1 Kazakhstan (FT)<br>San Marino v Belgium<br>Scotland v Russia </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T18:01:00.616Z\">at 7.01pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Too many players doing their own thing \u2013 \u201csome of the players just wanted to do whatever they wanted to do,\u201d Giggs says \u2013 that doesn\u2019t sound too healthy for Wales. Still, they got the job done in the end. Thanks for your company. Bye! Ryan Giggs discusses Wales\u2019s late win, but he is far from all smiles. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough first half, it wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Giggs says. \u201cWe had a game plan and we didn\u2019t stick to it. Some of the players just wanted to do whatever they wanted to do and it\u2019s not good enough. I wasn\u2019t happy at half-time. I was happy with the work-rate and the character to come back. But too many players didn\u2019t show up tonight. There were positives as well. Jonny Williams coming on. Joe Rodon, first cap, was immense.\u201d Some post-match reaction from the Scotland camp. \u201cWe were in a really good position in the game and we needed to [go on and] win,\u201d says John McGinn, who opened the scoring at Hampden Park. \u201cWe started on the front foot, showed what we are capable of but dropped back and a team like Russia will punish you. We allowed them to play to their strengths.\u201d The debutant, the Leeds defender Liam Cooper, adds: \u201cThe lads are gutted in there. We invited them on to us and teams like Russia are going to hurt you and we paid the price. It\u2019s always difficult when you step up to international level \u2013 teams can hurt you with one pass.\u201d Read Stuart James\u2019s match report: Read Ewan Murray\u2019s match report: A couple of post-match stats to get yer head around: no player has been directly involved in more goals in Euro 2020 qualifying than Artem Dzyuba (six goals, two assists), with the Russia captain at it again at Hampden Park this evening. The Zenit striker equalised before O\u2019Donnell and Zhirkov combined for the Russia winner. Also, Gareth Bale will be showered with praise as the Wales saviour in the fallout of a late \u2013 and crucial \u2013 victory over Azerbaijan. Bale has been directly involved in 19 goals in his last 19 home appearances for Wales (14 goals &amp; five assists). Not bad going, eh? Group C Germany 2-4 Netherlands Estonia 1-2 Belarus Group E Slovakia 0-4 Croatia Wales 2-1 Azerbaijan Group G Austria 6-0 Latvia Slovenia 2-0 Poland Group I San Marino 0-4 Belgium Scotland 1-2 Russia Cyprus 1-1 Kazakhstan Ronald Koeman\u2019s side get their own back in Group C. Steve Clarke\u2019s side are jeered off at Hampden Park. That defeat effectively puts paid to even the faintest hopes of landing a spot at Euro 2020. In truth, they were fortunate to lose out by only the single goal in the end. Gareth Bale\u2019s header is the difference in Cardiff. A much-needed win for Ryan Giggs. They earned victory the hard way, with Bale providing a relatively scrappy winner six minutes from time after Mahir Emreli levelled things up. The goal of the game? Undoubtedly Pavlo Pashayev\u2019s incredible own goal, a strike worthy of any blooper reel. He was oblivious as the ball smacked off of his back and beat his own goalkeeper. Georginio Wijnaldum seals victory in Hamburg. 90+2 min: Whoosh! Ben Davies wellies the ball clear for Wales. Back come Azerbaijan after Jonny Williams loses possession but Razmanov cannot get enough power on his low drive. Hennessey gathers. Wales are almost there. 90 min: Four added minutes at Hampden Park! And three minutes for Wales to hang on against Azerbaijan, who have a stoppage-time free-kick ... 88 min: Aleksandr Golovin is withdrawn in Glasgow. The Monaco man has been streets ahead of everyone else on the pitch at Hampden. A class act. 87 min: Can Scotland remedy an equaliser? Elsewhere, Austria have hit Latvia for six, with Arnautovic at the double. Matt Phillips is on at Hampden. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Gareth Bale heads Wales in front. Allen hammers the ball at goal, low and hard, Azerbaijan clear. Then Tom Lawrence cleverly blocks off the goalkeeper as the ball loops up into the air. As Wales desperately attempt to nudge it goalwards, there\u2019s Bale to nod in. Cardiff erupts. Donyell Malen scores his first goal for the Netherlands on his first cap for the senior side. Justice, perhaps, given the ludicrous penalty that went against de Ligt. 83 min: ... straight into the Azerbaijan wall. 82 min: Wales free-kick, 20 yards out. Gareth Bale steps up ... 80 min: Connor Roberts goes agonisingly close for Wales, dragging wide after meeting a low Daniel James cross. The pair were team-mates at Swansea last season. Roberts does almost everything perfectly, opening up his body to usher the ball goalwards but he doesn\u2019t quite get his angles right. And with that, Giggs makes his final change, with Ben Davies replacing Neil Taylor. Harry Wilson and Ethan Ampadu are off, with Jonny Williams and Sam Vokes on. Toni Kroos equalises from 12 yards after Matthijs de Ligt was penalised for anything but a deliberate handball. The Juventus defender was oblivious as to where the ball was as it bobbled up on to his left arm. Elsewhere, Croatia lead Slovakia 3-0 and Austria are 4-0 up at home to Latvia. 73 min: \u201cThat isn\u2019t the same Zhirkov who must be about a 100 by now, is it?\u201d emails Sarah Rothwell. It certainly is and, going on this evidence, the boy (he\u2019s now 36) has still very much got it. That was a wonderful effort a second ago. David Marshall has made two magnificent saves to keep Scotland in it at Hampden. 72 min: Charlie Mulgrew goes close for Scotland \u2013 but he cannot bend his free-kick inside a post! A decent effort up the other end, too, with David Marshall pulling off another fine save to deny Zhirkov a second. Steve Clarke must be tempted to throw on another set of fresh legs, with Matt Phillips and Stuart Armstrong on the bench. Some turnaround in Hamburg. Meanwhile, Nacer Chadli has added a third for Belgium in San Marino. Back at Hampden Park, Russia could have taken the game away from Scotland but for David Marshall, who gets fingertips to a Russia header. He palmed the ball on to the woodwork. Scotland are clinging on. Ah. Neil Taylor loses the ball on halfway and Mahir Emreli is played in. After Wayne Hennessey saved his initial effort, Emreli slots home the rebound. Emreli, for what it\u2019s worth, should probably not be on the field. But then neither should Harry Wilson, who went unpenalised despite appearing to stamp on an opponent. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Harry Wilson regularly in a Liverpool shirt,\u201d emails Matt Dony. \u201cPartly because he\u2019s very good, but also, admittedly, partly because he looks so much like Torres. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever loved a football like I loved Torres.\u201d Frenkie de Jong levels for Ronald Koeman\u2019s side. The Barcelona midfielder nabs his first goal for his country on his 10th appearance for the Dutch. It is a cute finish, after breaking into the box. 62 min: Changes afoot in Glasgow, as Steve Clarke opts to freshen things up. That Russia goal had been coming. Kenny McLean replaces James Forrest and Ryan Christie is on for John McGinn, whose opener feels a very long time ago now. Elsewhere, Dries Mertens has doubled Belgium\u2019s lead in San Marino and Austria are three goals to the good at home to Latvia. And a big goal in Hamburg to boot ... A major setback for Steve Clarke and Scotland. Golovin is slipped in behind Liam Cooper, who gets the wrong side of his man and Zhirkov, the former Chelsea winger, zooms in towards the back post, where he has Stephen O\u2019Donnell for company. The final touch may even have come via O\u2019Donnell, who was powerless by that point. It was a beautifully weighted through ball to Golovin, who rolled the ball across goal to the back stick, where a hybrid of Zhirkov and O\u2019Donnell helped it in. 54 min: Scotland are very much on the ropes. Liam Cooper, booked moments ago, throws himself to the ground to get a block in on Russia\u2019s Fernandes. Scotland do win a free-kick when Zobnin picks up a yellow card for a rash challenge on Scott McTominay but the ball in is straight down the throat of Guilherme. 52 min: The Wales defender Chris Mepham is booked for thundering into Sheydayev. It was a clumsy challenge and a silly yellow card. Elsewhere, Liam Cooper has been booked on his Scotland debut, with the hosts under the cosh at Hampden Park, where Russia are swarming all over Steve Clarke\u2019s side. Cooper is penalised for clattering into Dyzuba, who levelled things up in Glasgow. Scotland look anxious and are struggling to get out of their own half. It just keeps coming back at them. 47 min: Double drat for Wales! Croatia lead 2-0 in Slovakia, courtesy of Ivan Perisic\u2019s goal. The World Cup finalists have struck either side of the interval to establish a healthy two-goal cushion. No changes for Wales or Scotland at the break. 46 min: We\u2019re back under way. In Cardiff, Ryan Giggs strides out for the second half looking thoroughly hacked off. A big, exasperated puff of the cheeks. Maybe he had just seen a replay of Nikola Vlasic\u2019s goal on the stroke of half-time for Croatia against Slovakia. Wales are fourth in qualifying as things stand. England Under-21s win 3-2 in Turkey! It was something of an Arsenal masterclass in Izmit, with Reiss Nelson the match-winner after an Eddie Nketiah double. That is just the ticket for Aidy Boothroyd, who has been under the cosh since a dismal European campaign in Italy this summer. Phil Foden was in from the off, Mason Greenwood, the Manchester United teenager, stepped off the bench, while Tom Davies captained the team. Half-time reading, courtesy of Paul MacInnes: Group C Germany 1-0 Netherlands Group E Slovakia 0-1 Croatia Wales 1-0 Azerbaijan Group G Austria 2-0 Latvia Slovenia 1-0 Poland Group I San Marino 0-1 Belgium Scotland 1-1 Russia 45 min: Tom Lawrence does the hard bit, wringing an Azerbaijan defender inside-out before attempting to bend a left-footed strike into the far corner beyond the goalkeeper. There is not enough venom on it \u2013 but it was the right idea. 44 min: That\u2019s a killer for Scotland, a sucker-punch. Russia look in the mood, Steve Clarke\u2019s side frustrated, typified by a meaty challenge by James Forrest on Yuri Zhirkov. Yes, Zhirkov, the 36-year-old former Chelsea man is still going. In Cardiff, Azerbaijan\u2019s Emreli is fortunate \u2013 as Harry Wilson was earlier \u2013 to escape action after swinging an arm out at Chris Mepham. The defender is riled. Well, that\u2019s 1-1 in the should-have-been-a-red-card-stakes. Right on cue. Artem Dyzuba silences Glasgow. It is decent buildup play but the Russia captain and Zenit striker then seizes on a little good fortune, with his good first touch taking the sting out of the ball \u2013 which was inadvertently shinned into him by Liverpool\u2019s Andy Robertson \u2013 before firing low into the corner. That\u2019s his sixth goal in this qualifying campaign. That\u2019s his 21st goal in 37 games. 38 min: It remains early days but Belgium being held by San Marino is good news for Scotland, who lead at Hampden Park. As it stands, Scotland would slide above Russia and into second place in Group I, behind leaders Belgium. De Bruyne, Origi, Batshuayi and Tielemans have all been given the nod in Serravalle. Steve Clarke\u2019s side are looking relatively comfortable, if unconvincing. McBurnie has been fairly isolated. Still, long way to go, and all that. 32 min: Matthijs de Ligt has headed wide for the Netherlands in Hamburg, where Ronald Koeman\u2019s side remain on the hunt for an equaliser. In Turkey, England Under-21s have re-taken the lead to cap a crazy few minutes in Izmit. After going behind, the Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah popped up with an equaliser \u2013 his second goal of the evening \u2013 before Reiss Nelson poked England back in front. A gift for Ryan Giggs\u2019s side. A comical own goal. Gareth Bale steps inside and winds up to take aim from 25 yards. It all seems rather harmless, with an Azerbaijan defender getting a block in. The deflected ball cannons up into the air and Agayev, the visitors\u2019 goalkeeper, surges towards Daniel James, who is ready to feed off any scraps down the left. But as Agayev does so, leaving his goal empty, an oblivious Pashayev somehow diverts the ball home into his own net. The ball smacks his back and rolls in. A bizarre opener. 23 min: Austria are two goals to the good against Latvia, with Marcel Sabitzer adding a second after Arnautovic\u2019s opener. In Cardiff, Azerbaijan continue to frustrate Wales. Harry Wilson is very lucky to escape without even a booking \u2013 there is no video assistant referee in Euro 2020 qualifiers, of course. 21 min: The Netherlands have conceded a goal in the first 15 minutes of the match in each of their last three games against Germany: 9\u2019 Werner (19 November, 2018) 15\u2019 San\u00e9 (24 March, 2019) 9\u2019 Gnabry (6 September, 2019). Not a good look. 17 min: Harry Wilson is fortunate to still be on the field for Wales. The Liverpool winger, who is on a season\u2019s loan at Bournemouth, allows his frustration to get the better of him and, hot-headedly, appears to stamp on Richard Almeida de Oliveira. The Azerbaijan coach Nikola Jurcevic is baffled, as is Almeida. Wilson insists he only had eyes on the ball but he can count himself fortunate \u2013 it certainly did not look good. Moments later, Wales appeal for handball after Joe Allen\u2019s cross hit a flailing arm. Serge Gnabry has given Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side the lead in Hamburg. Lukas Klostermann had his initial effort saved and the Bayern Munich winger Gnabry, formerly of Arsenal, slammed in the rebound. Elsewhere, West Ham\u2019s Shanghai SIPG forward Marko Arnautovic has given Austria a 1-0 lead against Latvia in Group G. Ryan Fraser jinks on to his fight foot, whips the ball in, Guilherme, the Russia goalkeeper makes a real pig\u2019s ear of it and John McGinn profits, firing home the rebound from close range. Guilherme really will not want to see that again, with the Brazil-born goalkeeper failing to soak up the cross and instead allowing it to cannon off his torso and into the path of the grateful McGinn, who fires in his first goal for his country. Scotland and Steve Clarke will take that. 9 min: Scotland go close as O\u2019Donnell rattles a post! Steve Clarke\u2019s side win yet another \u2013 a third in quick succession \u2013 and O\u2019Donnell reacts quickest to try and prod the ball home after Oli McBurnie towers above his Russian marker to nod the ball downwards. The ball was whipped in by Ryan Fraser, helped on by McBurnie and very nearly converted by O\u2019Donnell, the Kilmarnock defender who worked under Clarke at club level before the former Chelsea coach assumed charge of his nation. 4 min: An encouraging half-chance for Tom Lawrence, with the Derby forward attempting to hook a clever cross by Gareth Bale goalwards. Bale raids down the right flank and dinks a ball into the front post, where Lawrence tries to steer it in but it bounces wide. Wales have certainly began brightly in Cardiff. 3 min: Harry Wilson whips in a free-kick towards the back post, where debutant Joe Rodon, who spent last year on loan at Cheltenham Town, is lurking. The defender attempts to stab it home but he cannot divert it goalwards. Rodon, along with his Swansea and Wales team-mate Connor Roberts, has enjoyed an impressive start to the season, with his performances at club level \u2013 Swansea top the Championship \u2013 earning international recognition. 2 min: Wales, and Ryan Giggs, could badly do with a result. Courtesy of the good folks at Opta, Wales have lost seven of their 13 games under the former Manchester United winger (W5 D1 L7), including each of the last two in a row; they haven\u2019t lost three consecutively since September 2012 (a run of five). Meanwhile, a energetic start for Scotland, with John McGinn drilling wide from 20 yards. We\u2019re under way in Cardiff, Glasgow and Hamburg. We are just a few minutes away from kick-off \u2013 a hearty national anthem or two. And here\u2019s a gentle reminder of what\u2019s in store: Group C Germany v Netherlands Group E Slovakia v Croatia Wales v Azerbaijan Group G Austria v Latvia Slovenia v Poland Group I San Marino v Belgium Scotland v Russia Ryan Giggs talks. \u201cI\u2019m really happy,\u201d Giggs says. \u201cA lot of players are in good form. I\u2019ve seen Joe Rodon a couple of times this year and he\u2019s in excellent form. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing them perform tonight. \u201c[Must-win talk is] understandable. You want to bounce back after two defeats. I\u2019m looking for a win and a good performance. I want clean sheets because I know the players up front will create chances. We\u2019ve not been ruthless enough so far. If we defend well, we should be scoring goals.\u201d Scotland\u2019s Steve Clarke speaks, and he seems relaxed. \u201cRussia are decent but we think we\u2019re pretty decent as well,\u201d the former Kilmarnock manager says. \u201cIf the lads can show me what they\u2019ve shown me in training, I\u2019ll think we\u2019ll be OK. We have to be positive. It is always important but we need to make sure that our front three are pushing right on and trying to get a bit of momentum in the game. It\u2019s always key how you defend and Liam [Cooper] has got good experience, he\u2019ll slot in there instead of Scott McKenna. Oli [McBurnie] is a young man, he had a big move in the summer and he\u2019s determined to show everyone how good he is.\u201d England Under-21s are level-pegging with Turkey at half-time: Arsenal\u2019s Eddie Nketiah, who is on a season\u2019s loan at Leeds, opened the scoring, converting Phil Foden\u2019s low cross from close range before Dogukan Sinik equalised, slotting beyond Bournemouth\u2019s Aaron Ramsdale. Talking of English goalkeepers ... Austria are in action in Group G \u2013 but not in Klagenfurt: Team news news: Gareth Bale starts and captains Wales in Cardiff, while Swansea\u2019s Joe Rodon makes his full debut at centre-back as Ryan Giggs makes five changes. Matthijs de Ligt is in from the off for the Netherlands alongside Virgil van Dijk for their humdinger with Germany. Elsewhere, a debut for Leeds\u2019 captain Liam Cooper in the heart of the Scotland defence, while Oli McBurnie leads the line and John McGinn\u2019s in midfield for Steve Clarke\u2019s side. As for the visitors at Hampden Park, Artem Dyzuba spearheads the Russia attack, as it feels he has done for the past couple of decades; no player has been involved in more goals in Euro 2020 qualifying than the Zenit striker (five goals, two assists), scoring more goals than Scotland have managed so far as a team (four). Germany v Netherlands Germany (3-4-3): Neuer; S\u00fcle, Tah, Ginter; Klostermann, Kimmich, Kroos, Schulz; Gnabry, Werner, Reus Subs: Leno, Ter Stegen, Hector, Havertz, Brandt, Halstenberg, Stark, Waldschmidt, G\u00fcndogan, Can Netherlands: Cillessen; Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Blind; De Roon, Wijnaldum, F De Jong; Promes, Depay, Babel Subs: Zoet, Veltman, Ak\u00e9, Pr\u00f6pper, Malen, Van Aanholt, Berghuis, Strootman, Vilhena, L De Jong, Kluivert, Vermeer Scotland v Russia Scotland (4-3-3): Marshall, O\u2019Donnell, Cooper, Mulgrew, Robertson; McTominay, McGinn, Forrest; Fraser, McBurnie, McGregor Subs: McLaughlin, MacGillivray, Bates, Jack, Devlin, McLean, Snodgrass, Armstrong, Phillips, Christie, Russell, Taylor Russia (4-2-3-1): Guilherme; Fernandes, Semyonov, Dzhikiya, Kudryashov; Ozdoyev, Zobnin; Ionov, Golovin, Zhirkov; Dzyuba Subs: Neustadter, Belyayev, Cheryshev, Barinov, Smolov, Akhmetov, Lunyov, Karavayev, Dzhankayev, Miranchuk, Yerokhin, Petrov Wales v Azerbaijan Wales (4-2-3-1): Hennessey; Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Taylor; Allen, Ampadu; James, T Lawrence, Wilson; Bale Subs: Ward, A Davies, Gunter, B Davies, Smith, Vokes, Moore, J Lawrence, Lockyer, Williams, Morrell, Vaulks Azerbaijan (4-2-3-1): Agayev; Pashayev, Medvedev, Mustafazade, Krivotsyuk; De Oliveira, Qarayev; Emreli, Nazarov, Rehimov; Sheydayev Subs: Abdullayev, Mahmudov, Ramazonov, Balayev, Eyyubov, Buludov, Ru Dadashov, Re Dadashov, Khalilzada, Huseynov, Mehemmedeliyev This is actually quite big. It is an evening whereby Scotland enter must-win territory if they have any designs of gatecrashing the Euro 2020 party and Wales badly need to jumpstart their own qualifying campaign, with serious questions beginning to be asked of Ryan Giggs, who remains something of a rookie manager. Then there is the small matter of old foes Germany against the Netherlands in Group C, currently topped by Northern Ireland, who welcome Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side to Belfast on Monday. Scotland have to navigate a way past Russia at Hampden Park, while Wales need to get back on track after successive defeats and given Azerbaijan have not won a European qualifier away from Baku in 31 attempts, everything points towards victory for Giggs\u2019s side in Cardiff. Wales are desperate to close the gap to Group E leaders Hungary, while Croatia and Slovakia are also ahead of them. Azerbaijan, who have conceded 10 goals in three qualifiers, are managed by Slaven Bilic\u2019s former assistant, Nikola Jurcevic. Scotland take on Russia, who are second placed in Group I, with leaders Belgium taking on San Marino. Steve Clarke\u2019s side kick-off six points off the pace but there are reasons to be cheerful in Glasgow, with the Scots having won their past five competitive matches on home soil. \u201cIt\u2019s about time that we as a nation, rather than being on the receiving end, are dishing out a result that\u2019s deemed an upset,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cHopefully Friday can be the case.\u201d As for that tantalising match-up in Hamburg, Ronald Koeman has been at pains to play down the significance of yielding victory. \u201cThe duel with Germany is not a key match,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cWe have to get 12 points against Estonia and Belarus and be better in the two games with Northern Ireland.\u201d Elsewhere, Gareth Southgate and Marcus Rashford have been speaking at Wembley ahead of England\u2019s game with Bulgaria, while, for the Under-21s, the road to Hungary and Slovakia for Euro 2021 begins. Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s side are in action in Turkey. Eddie Nketiah, Phil Foden, Ryan Sessegnon and Max Aarons all start in Izmit.

      "bodyText": "Some 52 refugees and asylum seekers in offshore detention have received temporary protection visas or safe haven enterprise visas, according to new statistics that fly in the face of the Morrison government\u2019s refusal to allow the Biloela Tamil family to stay. The home affairs department has revealed to a Senate inquiry that of the 3,127 people classified as \u201cillegal maritime arrivals\u201d who have been taken to a regional processing country since 2011, some 52 have received visas and now face legal limbo if banned from permanent settlement in Australia. Fourteen families are set to be broken up by a government bill to prevent asylum seekers who were sent to regional processing coming to Australia, it said. The statistics also reveal that of a total of 5,191 asylum seekers who came to Australia by boat 2,074 people were never transferred to a regional processing country. The new statistics were produced to the legal and constitutional affairs committee, which is currently examining the Coalition bill to prevent the 3,127 ever coming to Australia \u2013 even after they have settled in third countries such as the US or New Zealand. It is not clear how many of the asylum seekers arrived before or after the 19 July 2013 deadline, when the Rudd government decided that all asylum seekers who arrived by boat would be transferred to offshore detention and not be settled in Australia. But Labor senator Kim Carr, the deputy chair of the committee, said the statistics \u201cgive the lie to the argument that nobody will be settled here\u201d. On Friday, Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said the government \u201cdoesn\u2019t hesitate to use its discretion \u2026 when it suits them\u201d, citing the example of a Rohingyan refugee let in by home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, first revealed by Guardian Australia, which she said \u201cdidn\u2019t restart the boats\u201d. Keneally said it was \u201ccruel\u201d to suggest the Biloela Tamil family could apply for a work visa and have the wait times waived without giving a guarantee. Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim said the revelations \u201cundermine the Liberals\u2019 entire argument in support of offshore detention\u201d showing the \u201carbitrary nature\u201d of government decision-making about who had been sent to Nauru and Manus Island and who was allowed to stay in Australia. \u201cThe government\u2019s rhetoric has never relied on fact,\u201d he said. \u201cOperation Sovereign Borders is merely a political construct but this has blown their arguments out of the water \u2026 including the argument that it is necessary to deport the family from Biloela.\u201d On Wednesday, Scott Morrison said the government had not \u2013 to his knowledge \u2013 intervened to allow people he called \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d to stay in Australia in the more than 4,000 documented uses of ministerial discretion to grant visas despite reported cases of people allowed to stay. In recent weeks refugee advocates, Labor, the Greens, Alan Jones and Barnaby Joyce have urged the government to reverse plans to deport Tamil family Priya, Nadesalingam and their two Australian-born children Kopika, 4, and Tharunicaa, 2, who were sent to Christmas Island almost a week ago. On Friday the federal court extended its injunction preventing the government deporting Tharunicaa to 18 September. The home affairs department also revealed that \u201c14 families including babies born to stateless parents in Australia who have attained Australian citizenship and babies born to a permanent resident or citizen parent in Australia would be separated\u201d by the provisions of the bill. McKim said: \u201cThe confirmation that tearing families apart is official government policy is heart rending and unconscionable.\u201d \u201cThis tears at the very fabric of how we see ourselves as a country. [The prospect of] children being torn from their mothers or fathers arms is simply heart-rending. \u201cThis information alone should be enough for the Senate to reject the bill.\u201d Pip De Veau, the general counsel at home affairs, has said that nothing in the bill would invalidate temporary protection visas but conceded that at the expiration of those visas Dutton would need to exercise a further discretion to extend their stay, which McKim said put them at risk of immigration detention or deportation. Carr said the 52 people granted TPVs or safe haven enterprise visas would be \u201cleft in legal limbo\u201d and may be prevented from ever applying for another visa type \u201cirrespective of their individual circumstances\u201d. In July Guardian Australia revealed that in 2015 Dutton approved a plan to bring a refugee child to Australia after lobbying from Nauru, despite warnings from his department that it would be seen as a contradiction of the policy not to resettle people in Australia who came by boat. Dutton made the intervention on behalf of a stateless Rohingyan unaccompanied minor whose parents were murdered in front of him in Myanmar before he arrived at Christmas Island by boat in October 2013.",

Both Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese are feeling their way forward, day by day, week by week, rather than charging ahead, brimming with certainty.</p> <p>While the only certainty of right now is that everything remains protean, one post-election experiment really stands out on the Labor side.

Her portfolio assertiveness, the leaning in, is only in its infancy, but it has triggered small <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/kristina-keneally-deceiving-herself-on/news-story/42cee65dfe533ce7245f2791cb403457\">plumes of outrage</a> in the Australian, which appears intent on styling Keneally as its latest obnoxious progressive femme \u2013 possibly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a Hillary Clinton pants suit \u2013 although the precise caricature is still in development.</p> <p>Out in the real world, this querulous, Colonel Blimp-inspired hiss of <em>shut up girlie and let the grown ups talk</em> wafting from the national broadsheet buglers might be considered hitting a KPI \u2013 a sign that you are on the side of the angels \u2013 but, as they say in the classics, only time will tell.</p> <p>In any case, Labor is experimenting with, as Scott Morrison is fond of saying, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/17/the-meaning-of-morrisons-mantra-about-getting-a-fair-go-is-clear-its-conditional\">having a go to get a go</a>. To set our scene, Dutton is a black-and-white former Queensland cop who rolls forward relentlessly. The direction of travel is always a straight line, the velocity provided by the mantras that sustain and enlarge him as a political figure. Labor is ignoring Dutton\u2019s straight line and has begun popping up in less prosecuted areas in the border protection debate.</p> <p>The opposition is running a number of attack lines simultaneously, starting with whether the minister is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/26/labor-should-let-hope-prevail-on-refugees-shadow-minister-andrew-giles-says\">managing his large and complex portfolio competently</a> \u2013 pointing to blow-outs in processing times for visa claims and citizenship applications.</p> <p>Keneally is also asking whenever she\u2019s in front of an open microphone whether the Coalition\u2019s fixation on the boats has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/23/coalition-has-lost-control-of-borders-with-80000-asylum-arrivals-by-plane-labor-says\">allowed weakness to develop at airports</a> \u2013 invoking, for example, the 81,596 people who have arrived by plane and claimed asylum since 1 July 2014. \u201cPeter Dutton has failed to notice that criminal syndicates that people smugglers have shifted their business model from boats to planes,\u201d she declared on Friday. Another question being pursued is whether Australia\u2019s migration system is being used by criminal syndicates and labour hire companies to traffic exploited workers into Australia.</p> <p>The purpose of all this interference (apart from testing Dutton\u2019s capacity to multitask) is to pose a simple yet substantial question \u2013 does Australia really have the hard border of the Dutton talking points, or is this all just a massive confidence trick; the unchecked, uninterrogated fantasy of the flat-track bully?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When it comes to border protection, the Coalition feels a victim of its own success.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aligned with testing Dutton\u2019s shibboleths (call that Project Hard Border) is Project Compassion. Some in Labor think the Coalition has developed a political problem with its own progressive-leaning constituency \u2013 that there is now acute moral discomfort amongst many traditional small \u201cl\u201d Liberal voters about the cohort languishing in Nauru and Manus Island.</p> <p>The instinct that the centre of gravity in the Australian asylum debate might have shifted a few degrees in favour of compassion is giving Labor some comfort in holding firm (at least on all current evidence) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/aug/24/the-coalitions-border-cruelty-has-been-exposed-and-jacqui-lambie-will-decide-if-it-returns\">against the medevac repeal</a>, and in prosecuting the cause of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/06/tamil-family-to-stay-on-christmas-island-after-deportation-case-delayed\">Sri Lankan family from Biloela</a>. In workaday political terms, these case studies also allow Labor to project progressive values to elements of the base concerned that the party\u2019s failure to win government in May heralds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/27/anthony-albanese-on-the-progressive-backlash-people-are-looking-for-easy-answers\">a \u201cbitch and fold\u201d identity crisis</a>.</p> <p>But an interesting dimension in all this is that Labor is not experimenting with its post-election approach in a vacuum. The government is also cutting its cloth to suit the times.</p> <p>When it comes to border protection, the Coalition feels a victim of its own success. All the sovereignty-first invocations of the Howard era (\u201cwe decide who comes here\u201d) should be really potent in 2019; white hot, in fact, in a fractured political age where populism and nativism has taken root post global financial crisis. Yet there\u2019s a view that voters seem to think the Australian government has solved the problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/05/medevac-repeal-bill-coalition-accused-of-trying-to-reinstate-sociopathic-regime\">Medevac repeal bill: Coalition accused of trying to reinstate 'sociopathic' regime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So now the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/02/sri-lankan-asylum-surge-story-comes-at-a-convenient-moment-for-the-government\">trying to telegraph a slightly different message</a>. Yes, we were the people who stopped the boats (which was always a stretch incidentally, given the boats kept coming, not frequently, but regularly).</p> <p>We stopped them, but be aware those people smugglers can start up again at anytime, and that\u2019s why you need (as Scott Morrison declared on Monday) a government \u201cable to defeat [the boats] time and time and time and time again\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s an obvious irony here of course. Morrison was the architect of \u201con water\u201d matters, a policy mantra predicated on low to no disclosure of what was going on in the ocean to the north of Australia under Operation Sovereign Borders.</p> <p>But now the balance of political risks and opportunities has shifted in favour of selective disclosure. Morrison was admirably frank earlier this week when he noted that talking about the ventures the government wants to talk about \u201ckeeps the issue of the ever-present threat of illegal arrivals to Australia foremost in the public\u2019s mind\u201d. Not much subtlety there.</p> <p>So how does this story end? Labor\u2019s newly found assertiveness is not without political risk, and senior players know that the downside of engagement is opening up a corrosive conversation, historically prone to manipulation, that could be damaging both for the country and for Labor\u2019s election prospects.</p> <p>But as one senior player puts it: \u201cTalking about boats might mean the government wins. But if we don\u2019t talk, they win too.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sorry to be blunt, but suggesting that anything in national politics right now is being governed by a coherent, grand masterplan is complete and utter bollocks. Both Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese are feeling their way forward, day by day, week by week, rather than charging ahead, brimming with certainty. While the only certainty of right now is that everything remains protean, one post-election experiment really stands out on the Labor side. It\u2019s been conventional wisdom in Labor since losing the Tampa election that every time asylum boats hit the headlines, the Coalition prospers. But rather than shrink away from the conversation, the opposition has opened a political contest. Kristina Keneally, who was given home affairs by Albanese after blasting her way into the front bench when some of the right faction blokes thought her advancement post-election might be optional, is showing little inclination to cower behind the furniture when Peter Dutton rumbles in like a cement mixer on Ray Hadley, or Paul Murray, or when the invisible hand works its \u201csenior security sources\u201d magic in the Courier Mail or the Australian, trumpeting some imminent boat-related Armageddon. Keneally is responding to the predictable Dutton complex shtick by smiling amiably, and shoving right back. Her portfolio assertiveness, the leaning in, is only in its infancy, but it has triggered small plumes of outrage in the Australian, which appears intent on styling Keneally as its latest obnoxious progressive femme \u2013 possibly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a Hillary Clinton pants suit \u2013 although the precise caricature is still in development. Out in the real world, this querulous, Colonel Blimp-inspired hiss of shut up girlie and let the grown ups talk wafting from the national broadsheet buglers might be considered hitting a KPI \u2013 a sign that you are on the side of the angels \u2013 but, as they say in the classics, only time will tell. In any case, Labor is experimenting with, as Scott Morrison is fond of saying, having a go to get a go. To set our scene, Dutton is a black-and-white former Queensland cop who rolls forward relentlessly. The direction of travel is always a straight line, the velocity provided by the mantras that sustain and enlarge him as a political figure. Labor is ignoring Dutton\u2019s straight line and has begun popping up in less prosecuted areas in the border protection debate. The opposition is running a number of attack lines simultaneously, starting with whether the minister is managing his large and complex portfolio competently \u2013 pointing to blow-outs in processing times for visa claims and citizenship applications. Keneally is also asking whenever she\u2019s in front of an open microphone whether the Coalition\u2019s fixation on the boats has allowed weakness to develop at airports \u2013 invoking, for example, the 81,596 people who have arrived by plane and claimed asylum since 1 July 2014. \u201cPeter Dutton has failed to notice that criminal syndicates that people smugglers have shifted their business model from boats to planes,\u201d she declared on Friday. Another question being pursued is whether Australia\u2019s migration system is being used by criminal syndicates and labour hire companies to traffic exploited workers into Australia. The purpose of all this interference (apart from testing Dutton\u2019s capacity to multitask) is to pose a simple yet substantial question \u2013 does Australia really have the hard border of the Dutton talking points, or is this all just a massive confidence trick; the unchecked, uninterrogated fantasy of the flat-track bully? Aligned with testing Dutton\u2019s shibboleths (call that Project Hard Border) is Project Compassion. Some in Labor think the Coalition has developed a political problem with its own progressive-leaning constituency \u2013 that there is now acute moral discomfort amongst many traditional small \u201cl\u201d Liberal voters about the cohort languishing in Nauru and Manus Island. The instinct that the centre of gravity in the Australian asylum debate might have shifted a few degrees in favour of compassion is giving Labor some comfort in holding firm (at least on all current evidence) against the medevac repeal, and in prosecuting the cause of the Sri Lankan family from Biloela. In workaday political terms, these case studies also allow Labor to project progressive values to elements of the base concerned that the party\u2019s failure to win government in May heralds a \u201cbitch and fold\u201d identity crisis. But an interesting dimension in all this is that Labor is not experimenting with its post-election approach in a vacuum. The government is also cutting its cloth to suit the times. When it comes to border protection, the Coalition feels a victim of its own success. All the sovereignty-first invocations of the Howard era (\u201cwe decide who comes here\u201d) should be really potent in 2019; white hot, in fact, in a fractured political age where populism and nativism has taken root post global financial crisis. Yet there\u2019s a view that voters seem to think the Australian government has solved the problem. So now the government is trying to telegraph a slightly different message. Yes, we were the people who stopped the boats (which was always a stretch incidentally, given the boats kept coming, not frequently, but regularly). We stopped them, but be aware those people smugglers can start up again at anytime, and that\u2019s why you need (as Scott Morrison declared on Monday) a government \u201cable to defeat [the boats] time and time and time and time again\u201d. There\u2019s an obvious irony here of course. Morrison was the architect of \u201con water\u201d matters, a policy mantra predicated on low to no disclosure of what was going on in the ocean to the north of Australia under Operation Sovereign Borders. But now the balance of political risks and opportunities has shifted in favour of selective disclosure. Morrison was admirably frank earlier this week when he noted that talking about the ventures the government wants to talk about \u201ckeeps the issue of the ever-present threat of illegal arrivals to Australia foremost in the public\u2019s mind\u201d. Not much subtlety there. So how does this story end? Labor\u2019s newly found assertiveness is not without political risk, and senior players know that the downside of engagement is opening up a corrosive conversation, historically prone to manipulation, that could be damaging both for the country and for Labor\u2019s election prospects. But as one senior player puts it: \u201cTalking about boats might mean the government wins. But if we don\u2019t talk, they win too.\u201d",

The sense of her isolation in these early years, as she recalls it now, is palpable. It was a time when resources and public and professional opinion was overwhelmingly damaging to her child.</p> <p>And as Georgie went from dysphoric to suicidal, everyone around Robertson wanted to blame the mother.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>It felt like a really invidious position to be in.

potential fire threat.</p> <p>On Friday, just a week into September, authorities issued total fire bans in Queensland and parts of New South Wales, with extreme, and potentially catastrophic, conditions expected in some areas.</p> <p>Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said winter had brought some significant fires to the north of the country and recent weeks had seen a spate of fires in south-east Queensland and NSW.</p> <p>He said the ongoing drought was driving much of the risk this season and there was concern for forested areas that were already dry heading into the warmer months.</p> <p>Thornton said that included a swathe beginning south of Rockhampton in Queensland and running all the way down the east coast into NSW and east Gippsland in Victoria.</p> <p>\u201cThat takes in the major populated areas in south-east Queensland and around Sydney and the ACT \u2013 so some pretty significant population

      "bodyText": "Out in the Macquarie Marshes, about 1ookm north of Warren in the central west of New South Wales, large inland wetlands have become a place for the dead and dying. \u201cWe went out last night and there was a little patch of water with dead and dying European carp,\u201d Richard Kingsford, the director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, says. \u201cThere\u2019s dead and dying things everywhere. Kangaroos dying and even foxes are dying. \u201cWe were trying to trap for turtles but there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough water for turtles. I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019ve gone to.\u201d There are large parts of the Macquarie River that have dried up completely as the state remains in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record. Valley water storages in the Macquarie are sitting at 11%. In the Namoi, in north-west NSW where water shortages have been acute, they\u2019re at 1.5%. The Border Rivers, in the region between the NSW and Queensland border, are at 6%. In Sydney, dam storages have dropped below 50% for the first time in more than a decade. It\u2019s one part of the climate crisis playing out across much of the country. A different year, similar story. Most places are drier than usual, warmer than usual. Repeat episode? The summer of 2018 brought record-breaking heat for Australia. It\u2019s too early to say whether this summer will bring such extremes. But early outlooks for spring and December are again pointing to above average temperatures. And with the exception of parts of Western Australia and the west of Tasmania, the outlook is for below average rainfall. \u201cFor most of Australia it\u2019s this consistent dry story for the remainder of the year,\u201d Jonathan Pollock, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, says. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely it\u2019s going to be hotter than usual and it\u2019s very likely it\u2019s going to be drier than usual.\u201d For the first eight months of the year, the country\u2019s mean temperature was the second warmest on record. Mean maximums were the warmest on record over the same period and mean minimums the equal-sixth warmest. Rainfall through winter was below to very much below average for most of the country, including New South Wales, southern and western Queensland, parts of northern and eastern Victoria, the east coast of Tasmania, the majority of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and most of the eastern half of Western Australia, and some coastal areas in the west of that state. In drought-hit parts of eastern and southern Australia, rainfall levels for the season were in the lowest 10% of historical records. Pollock says it would take something like a La Ni\u00f1a, which is associated with heavier rainfall, \u201cto bring the turnaround that we need\u201d. The El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation is currently neutral and is expected to remain so until the end of 2019 and into early 2020. The prolonged dry and warm conditions have meant authorities have already issued warnings for the spring and into summer. Fire services have told communities to be ready for a challenging bushfire season and to prepare their homes, properties and evacuation plans early. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre published its seasonal outlook last week, which warned parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and parts of Western Australia and South Australia, face an above normal potential fire threat. On Friday, just a week into September, authorities issued total fire bans in Queensland and parts of New South Wales, with extreme, and potentially catastrophic, conditions expected in some areas. Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said winter had brought some significant fires to the north of the country and recent weeks had seen a spate of fires in south-east Queensland and NSW. He said the ongoing drought was driving much of the risk this season and there was concern for forested areas that were already dry heading into the warmer months. Thornton said that included a swathe beginning south of Rockhampton in Queensland and running all the way down the east coast into NSW and east Gippsland in Victoria. \u201cThat takes in the major populated areas in south-east Queensland and around Sydney and the ACT \u2013 so some pretty significant population centres,\u201d he said. He said the conditions in eastern Tasmania, South Australia\u2019s Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, south-western WA and parts of the Nullarbor, where rainfall has regenerated grasslands, also looked challenging. In a couple of months, authorities will revisit the outlook to see if anything has changed heading into January and February 2020. Along river systems in New South Wales, the outlook is similarly grim. In the summer of 2018, low river flows caused by a combination of drought and over-extraction of water, coupled with extreme temperatures, caused an environmental catastrophe that killed thousands of fish. Fisheries managers say they anticipate more fish are likely to perish this season if the drought continues. A spokeswoman for the NSW Department of Primary Industries said it was \u201can evolving situation\u201d and aquatic habitats were being closely monitored. \u201cSignificant concerns are held for the Lower Darling, Namoi, Macquarie and Lachlan catchments in the early part of the summer as well as the Barwon-Darling, Border Rivers and Gwydir should current conditions persist,\u201d she said. Up in Queensland, Angus Emmott, an ecologist and farmer, runs a cattle station about 130km south-east of Longreach. The property primarily receives its rain in summer but, until last year, it had what he calls \u201ceight failed summer rains in a row\u201d. That broke last summer, as a result of \u201ctwo big floods\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re having a really good season unlike much of the country to the east of us,\u201d Emmott says. \u201cUp above us, near Julia Creek, they\u2019ve had so much rain it killed three-quarters of a million head of cattle and washed all the fences and pastures away when Townsville got flooded as well\u201d.

In a bit more than a week, he says farmers will be travelling to Canberra to call for a national strategy on climate and agriculture. \u201cI think things can change and they actually are but they would change so much quicker if we had a government that took some leadership,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have to drag them kicking and screaming, we\u2019d get places a lot quicker.

The Murdoch media \u2013 in Australia, the US and in the UK \u2013 led the charge to go to war in Iraq in 2003; 16 years later we are still paying the price in Iraq, Syria and an emboldened Iran. In the UK, Murdoch backed both Brexit and, for a time, Scotland breaking away from Britain. In the US, Murdoch\u2019s Fox has been the great Trump enabler.

My government had advanced a fibre optic to the premises NBN across Australia as part of a $42bn plan. Murdoch was determined to kill it because it represented a threat to his only significant profit centre left in Australia, the Fox cable entertainment network. Why? Because the NBN we were building would enable Foxtel competitors such as Netflix to provide direct entertainment products to the home. Which is why Murdoch did a deal with the Liberals to kill it by turning fibre optic to the premises into fibre optic to the node, thereby leaving the last bit of the NBN unconnected unless customers were willing to pay for it. This has left Australia\u2019s broadband one of the slowest and least reliable in the world. Denials by Murdoch executives, or by their Liberal party accomplices, are unbelievable.</p> <p>Murdoch\u2019s agenda is patently ideological, commercial and of course political.

And last, but certainly not least, might Chelsea\u2019s failure to qualify for the Champions League prove a blessing in disguise for Emma Hayes and her players? Such potentially strong narratives seem timely. This, after all, is the moment when the domestic game hopes to take possession of the hearts and minds captured during live TV coverage of Phil Neville\u2019s Lionesses and their journey to the semi-finals of the World Cup in France. Securing long-term allegiances \u2013 not to mention persuading spectators to shift from sofa to stands \u2013 will not happen overnight but this season\u2019s WSL does not lack selling points. The promotion of Manchester United and Tottenham creates derbies in Manchester, starting Saturday\u2019s at the Etihad Stadium, and in north London, starting on Sunday, while Yeovil\u2019s relegation evens up a newly configured 12-team top division. If last season\u2019s top three \u2013 Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea \u2013 appear set to renew title rivalries, the bar has been raised as everyone tries to fathom how to depose Montemurro\u2019s champions.

      "bodyText": "In 1942, seven-year-old Franky Duffy stood with his father on the hill at Henson Park in Sydney\u2019s inner west and watched his first game of rugby league between the Newtown Jets and the Balmain Tigers. \u201cHe asked me \u2018Who are you going to go for?\u2019 and I said \u2018Whoever wins.\u2019 Well Balmain won that day and I\u2019ve supported them ever since,\u201d Duffy said this week. Now 84 and a lifetime member of the Tigers, for decades he was a near-permanent fixture at the club\u2019s spiritual home, Leichhardt Oval, where he sold \u201cdoubles\u201d tickets at the main gate off Mary Street. He remembers nights of near pandemonium at the ground. Crowds spellbound by the legendary Keith \u201cGolden Boots\u201d Barnes taking penalty kicks from the other side of halfway and, in the late 1980s, watching the last great Balmain side: Ben Elias, Gary Jack, Wayne Pearce. On Sunday the Tigers (no longer Balmain, now Wests) will return to Leichhardt to play the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. With one round remaining in the regular season, the two sides are playing for the final spot in the competition\u2019s top eight: the winner will play in the finals, the loser will not. And yet a good deal of the anticipation revolves around the venue itself. Nicknamed endearingly (but with tongue firmly in cheek) by fans as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d, Leichhardt is the most famous of rugby league\u2019s suburban sanctuaries. When it\u2019s full \u2013 as it will be on Sunday \u2013 the ground becomes a marketer\u2019s dream. The packed hill, framed by huge Moreton bay figs, heaves and groans like a living organism, and the red rooftops of suburban Lilyfield that surround the ground become a second grandstand. It is a properly authentic expression of the game\u2019s working-class roots, and a return to the glory days of the kind of people like Duffy still remember. \u201cIt\u2019s just home, mate,\u201d Duffy says. \u201cIt was always just home.\u201d But it raises the question: why don\u2019t we do this more often? Because beneath the hype of this game, there is another story, one that embodies a tension between the past and the future that rugby league has grappled with for decades. Sunday will be only the third time the Tigers have played at Leichhardt this season, a long-running arrangement which reflects a broader decline in the use of rugby league\u2019s historic home in Sydney\u2019s suburbs. It\u2019s the same at all the old Sydney clubs. St George played five home games at Kogarah this year, taking the rest to Wollongong or the Sydney Cricket Ground. Canterbury-Bankstown visited their traditional home in Belmore only once, and South Sydney left Redfern for the stale confines of the Olympic stadium at Homebush years ago. The former ABC managing director and North Sydney Bears president, David Hill, says the decline of the suburban stadium is representative of the demise of the traditional working class and the tribalism that once existed in the sport. \u201cRugby league has always been stronger in the blue-collar, working-class areas, but of course the blue-collar worker has begun to disappear,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I played juniors and grade with Norths, the lower north shore was working class and Catholic. There would have been 50 junior rugby league teams south of Marlborough Road [Willoughby] when I was there. Now there are none. With gentrification, the fierce neighbourhood loyalty of those parts of Sydney is gone.\u201d He points to the example of Aaron Woods, a former Tigers captain who has Leichhardt\u2019s postcode tattooed on his buttocks. This week Woods will line up for Cronulla. Woods was asked whether Leichhardt was still his favourite ground: \u201cOne hundred per cent. Look at my undies, they\u2019ve got 2040 on them. It\u2019s where I grew up. It doesn\u2019t change because I\u2019m not playing for them.

      "bodyText": "Leading Democrats have condemned reported moves by the Trump administration to effectively bar refugees arriving from most parts of the world. As reported by the New York Times, the administration plans to cut back on a decades-old programme that each year admits tens of thousands fleeing war, persecution and famine. In meetings held over the past several weeks, the Times said, \u201cone top administration official\u201d has proposed cancelling refugee admissions entirely and leaving the president with the authority to admit refugees in an emergency. Under a second proposal, the paper said, citing \u201ccurrent and former administration officials\u201d, the number of refugees admitted would be cut in half, to about 10,000 to 15,000, with precedence given to countries or groups with special status, such as Iraqis and Afghans who have worked with US troops. Among Democratic presidential candidates, condemnation was swift and fierce. \u201cWe need more refugees, not fewer,\u201d tweeted the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u201cThis administration, which believes the words engraved into the Statue of Liberty should be rewritten, has no idea what our country stands for. \u201cAmerica was founded by refugees, immigrants, asylum seekers \u2013 and every day, they make us stronger.\u201d The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren called the initiative \u201cimmoral\u201d. \u201cOur laws and values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs president, I\u2019ll welcome at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term.\u201d According to the New York Times, officials will consider the proposals next week, seeking to determine the number of admissions for the coming year. In the first two years of the Trump administration the number of refugees admitted annually has been cut to 30,000, a 70% drop from when Barack Obama left office. The Obama administration set a goal of 110,000 entries in 2017. About 3 million refugees have been resettled since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980. The Trump administration is determined to make entry more difficult for all migrants. In a statement, Betsy Fisher, policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said: \u201cVulnerable refugees need protection, regardless of their nationality or religion.

      "bodyText": "Jason Roy left the field with his middle stump uprooted and no greater sense of belonging in Test cricket. But according to Rory Burns, his close friend, the right-hander remains upbeat regardless. Roy\u2019s move down into the middle order started brightly enough, opening his account with a caressed four through extra off Josh Hazlewood. But on 22 it was terminated by the same man who, amid an impressive three-wicket burst that cashed in on the pressure built by Pat Cummins after tea, exposed his defence by jagging one between bat and pad. Having averaged 9.5 as an opener in the series, and spoken before the Test about being drained from the World Cup, Roy likely has one final chance to demonstrate his game can transfer to the longest format; his Surrey teammate, Ollie Pope, is next in line having already been on standby as a concussion replacement. Burns, who has risen through the county ranks with Roy, said: \u201cHe\u2019s all right. He\u2019s still the same old Jason, which you like to see. He hasn\u2019t changed in terms of how he is off the park and that\u2019s a good thing. He got a start and would have liked a few more but it is something to build on.\u201d In contrast to Roy, Burns is enjoying a breakthrough summer and though disappointed to fall for 81, the left-hander now boasts 323 runs for the series \u2013 some 99 runs more than the rest of the openers on both sides combined. On the match situation, which sees England resuming on 200 for five and still 98 away from avoiding the follow-on, Burns said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a fight and it\u2019s very obvious what we need to do. A couple of good partnerships and then we are up close to them, and we\u2019re asking them to make a play. We have got to look at from a positive aspect. The way Headingley went, anything is possible.\u201d As Jofra Archer spent the day reflecting on his first wicketless outing in Test cricket, England\u2019s bowling coach, Chris Silverwood, moved to warn the wider public that expectations for the young quick must remain tempered. Already a World Cup winner in his first summer of international cricket, Archer burst on to the Test scene at Lord\u2019s with the high-octane spell that felled Steve Smith and then claimed six for 45 in the first innings at Headingley through a skilful harnessing of seaming conditions. But after the 24-year-old shipped none for 97 from 27 overs in Australia\u2019s first innings at Old Trafford, looking down on pace and failing to disrupt Smith en route to his third double century against England, Silverwood was quick to urge patience. \u201cI think we\u2019re just going to be careful with Jofra,\u201d Silverwood saidtold Sky Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s playing his third Test match, so we\u2019ve got to cut him a little bit of slack. He\u2019s still finding his way into international cricket. He\u2019s figuring out what it\u2019s all about. \u201cTest cricket is hard work. You must put the workload in, but it\u2019s there, and he\u2019s trying and we\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s capable of. But he\u2019s not going to do it every day.\u201d Archer may well earn an extended breather after this series, with England now pondering resting their leading multiformat players during the five-match Twenty20 series in New Zealand this November before returning to near-full strength for the two Tests that follow. Two players who may well benefit from this and receive their first England call-ups in short-form cricket are the Somerset opener Tom Banton and Saqib Mahmood, the Lancashire quick, who are known to be in the thoughts of the selectors as they look to blood the next generation. Jimmy Anderson may well be held back from the Tests in New Zealand. After failing to recover from the calf injury that struck in the first Ashes Test, there are thoughts of sending the 37-year-old to South Africa in early December as part of a bowling camp with a view to readying him for the four-Test series against the Proteas that begins on Boxing Day.",

The country\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said Ireland will give a \u201cgenerous\u201d response to the proposal but dampened hopes that it amounted to a major breakthrough after a 90-minute meeting with Michael Gove in Cambridge on Friday night. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to pretend that if we can solve the agri-food issue, then technology can solve the rest,\u201d Coveney told a meeting of the British Irish Association also attended by Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning. The idea of an epidemiological zone covering the whole island had been mooted previously in early Brexit talks but ultimately rejected because of the implacable opposition of the Democratic Unionist party, who said it would amount to checks down the Irish sea. However, Johnson revealed the shift in policy on Tuesday and sources have confirmed it is a \u201cserious proposal\u201d which will be put to the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, when the two premiers meet in Dublin on Monday. There was some scepticism that what the British prime minister had in mind was regulatory alignment on food between Ireland and the UK, something suggested by the Alternative Arrangements Commission, the privately funded body which has been examining how to replace the backstop. But sources have confirmed that this is not the case and Johnson\u2019s thinking is that Northern Ireland would remain aligned to EU standards in the Republic of Ireland if the UK diverged from EU standards at a future point. Asked if there was merit in this proposal, Coveney said \u201cyes\u201d and added that he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Gove during his meeting. But Coveney warned that Ireland found Johnson\u2019s decision to backslide on commitments to Ireland in his letter last month to the president of the European council Donald Tusk a major problem that was unlikely to be resolved in the six weeks to Brexit day. \u201cThe letter from PM Johnson to Donald Tusk, and the element of that letter which no longer committed to the commitments made in December 2017 [in the joint report ending the first phase of Brexit talks], that [said] the fallback was regulatory alignment if all else fails \u2013 for us that was really concerning, significantly denting trust between the two governments. \u201cIf there is emerging thinking within the British government moving back towards regulatory alignment, rather than trusted trader schemes, scanners etc, then that is progress,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Three late-evening wickets from Josh Hazlewood have left England with a mighty struggle to save this game and keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. In a six-over spell just before the intervention of bad light Hazlewood dispatched two of England\u2019s most adhesive batsmen, Rory Burns and Joe Root, who had assembled a dutiful partnership of 141. Then he clean bowled Jason Roy, who attracts many adjectives which do not, however, include \u201cadhesive\u201d, whether batting or fielding.</p> <p>So England ended the day on 200 for five, 98 runs short of the follow-on target \u2013 though that may not be relevant \u2013 and there remains the possibility of another 196 overs in this match with the forecast fine. There is an awful lot of batting to be done for England to draw this game but at least Burns and Root have demonstrated that there is a possible route to survival.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/06/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-fourth-test-day-three-live-cricket\">Ashes 2019: England v Australia fourth Test, day three \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Play was delayed until 1.30pm but it did not take long for the Australians to make further inroads. Craig Overton, reassuringly calm on Thursday evening in the unaccustomed role as nightwatchman, was dismissed in the second over of the day by Hazlewood. He pushed forward and edged to second slip where Steve Smith held a sharp chance.</p> <p>So once again Root was at the crease before the score had passed 30. At the other end was the increasingly reassuring sight of Burns, in his 11th Test and regarded as something of a stalwart. Mitchell Starc beat the outside edge of Burns\u2019 bat three times but the Surrey captain remained almost as imperturbable as his predecessor, John Edrich, used to be after failing to make contact. Then Pat Cummins was summoned from the Statham End and he also provided problems, mostly from short deliveries directed at Burns\u2019 chest; they were not short enough to duck, yet hard to defend safely. Burns looked uncomfortable without being flustered, one of his great assets.</p> <p>Before long Nathan Lyon was introduced and he found slow, consistent turn. The Australian off-spinner has tormented left-handed batsmen in recent times, yet Burns has played him well with his own idiosyncratic system. Given the slightest encouragement he plays the cut shot. The ball from Lyon does not have to be very short or wide for Burns to rock back on to his stumps and hit the ball away square of the wicket. Often Lyon\u2019s arms would go up in anticipation but Burns, ever eager to stay on the back foot, jammed his bat down in time. It seemed surprisingly easy for this left-hander to get to the other end. The blunt truth is that Lyon has bowled better to Ben Stokes in this series than to Burns.

      "bodyText": "Three late-evening wickets from Josh Hazlewood have left England with a mighty struggle to save this game and keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. In a six-over spell just before the intervention of bad light Hazlewood dispatched two of England\u2019s most adhesive batsmen, Rory Burns and Joe Root, who had assembled a dutiful partnership of 141. Then he clean bowled Jason Roy, who attracts many adjectives which do not, however, include \u201cadhesive\u201d, whether batting or fielding. So England ended the day on 200 for five, 98 runs short of the follow-on target \u2013 though that may not be relevant \u2013 and there remains the possibility of another 196 overs in this match with the forecast fine. There is an awful lot of batting to be done for England to draw this game but at least Burns and Root have demonstrated that there is a possible route to survival. Play was delayed until 1.30pm but it did not take long for the Australians to make further inroads. Craig Overton, reassuringly calm on Thursday evening in the unaccustomed role as nightwatchman, was dismissed in the second over of the day by Hazlewood. He pushed forward and edged to second slip where Steve Smith held a sharp chance. So once again Root was at the crease before the score had passed 30. At the other end was the increasingly reassuring sight of Burns, in his 11th Test and regarded as something of a stalwart. Mitchell Starc beat the outside edge of Burns\u2019 bat three times but the Surrey captain remained almost as imperturbable as his predecessor, John Edrich, used to be after failing to make contact. Then Pat Cummins was summoned from the Statham End and he also provided problems, mostly from short deliveries directed at Burns\u2019 chest; they were not short enough to duck, yet hard to defend safely. Burns looked uncomfortable without being flustered, one of his great assets. Before long Nathan Lyon was introduced and he found slow, consistent turn. The Australian off-spinner has tormented left-handed batsmen in recent times, yet Burns has played him well with his own idiosyncratic system. Given the slightest encouragement he plays the cut shot. The ball from Lyon does not have to be very short or wide for Burns to rock back on to his stumps and hit the ball away square of the wicket. Often Lyon\u2019s arms would go up in anticipation but Burns, ever eager to stay on the back foot, jammed his bat down in time. It seemed surprisingly easy for this left-hander to get to the other end. The blunt truth is that Lyon has bowled better to Ben Stokes in this series than to Burns. In fact Lyon proved to be much more of a problem for Root, who is usually such an effective player against spin. Yet he was tied down by Lyon and his attempts to break free were seldom convincing. He swept occasionally; once or twice he came down the wicket. Yet he was never able to impose himself during a high-quality duel. This would not be one of Root\u2019s silky innings. There was a constant distraction for Lyon. The fans in the massive temporary stand, renamed the party stand, decided to give their full attention to him, focussing on that missed run out at the end of the Headingley Test. Every time the ball was thrown back to Lyon during his spell, they cheered raucously when he gathered the ball cleanly. Lyon and his teammates seemed mildly amused to start with but the impression grew that the novelty was beginning to wear off for the Australians after an hour or so. The partnership was given a boost when Starc returned for his second spell. He leaked 20 runs from two overs, mostly from the bat of Burns, a reminder of why the Australians have been reluctant to pick him throughout the series. As a consequence the pressure eased a little; the hundred partnership was posted and it was time for tea. After the break, Tim Paine tossed the ball to his best pace bowler in the series and he got the appropriate response, but no immediate reward. Cummins bowled another fine spell that was hostile and accurate. His short balls troubled Burns, his fuller ones Root. When England\u2019s captain was on 54 he flicked towards the leg side yet only edged the ball between the keeper, Paine, and first slip, David Warner. Neither man moved and Root was on 58. In his exasperation Paine reviewed an lbw off Cummins, but, almost in the manner of Smith, Root\u2019s leg was struck outside the line of off-stump, another \u201cemotional\u201d Aussie review.

WELCOME TO THE FAMILY! \u201cAs a relatively new fan, I\u2019m curious to see what are your thoughts about how Steve Smith matches up against some of the best batsmen of all time? Would he make your top 5 list? On a second note, my dad got into the blog 10 years ago, would I become the first legacy to make it?\u201d</p> <p>Not sure if you are the first legacy but let\u2019s say you are. Well done. As for Smith, he is statistically the second best player of all time. That\u2019ll do for me, given this has overwhelmingly been a bowling era. I\u2019m now going to get 100 emails about Virat Kohli and 100 more about Sachin Tendkular, but it\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take. But overall, Colin, I would caution against comparing players across eras.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d725ec08f082514879ef257\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T13:30:26.944Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>23rd over: England 50-2 (Burns 28, Root 10)</strong> What do you know, a <strong>no-ball called</strong> when Cummins is seen to overstep by Umpire Dharmasena.

They may not be cut out for the job, and you have also lost your best operator. The added burden of captaining does take focus from your primary role in the side. You can also see this with Bairstow when he has the gloves.\u201d</p> <p>They missed a trick in 2016 with YJB, for mine. That summer - his best, by a mile, with the blade - he kept poorly. This was the time to give him the big batting promotion and move the gloves elsewhere. It\u2019s difficult to see how they manage that transition now, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s an excellent \u2018keeper and wants to keep things are they are. </p> <p>\u201cGraham Currie (12:14) wonders why teams keep giving the captaincy to the best player,\u201d writes Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cSurely it\u2019s not so much that they give it to the best player, but to the player least likely to be dropped? I suppose you could have a series with a different captain each match, but some stability is surely desirable.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, that\u2019s definitely part of it. It\u2019s why Australia <em>might</em> have a problem as Khawaja could have been a temporary fix but he\u2019s found himself out of the XI now and, in turn, a fair way back in the pack. </p> <p>\u201cNine in Australia is gracing us with highlights from the 1st 1994 Test in Brisbane,\u201d reports Thomas Chick. \u201cBack in a time where shadows on text thicker than the text itself were in fashion, and when a change from, say, a score of 49 to a score of 50 would sometimes display 59 for a frame or two.\u201d Simpler times.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7248e08f083106f45568da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T11:58:02.334Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Craig McEwan is reading in from Lima. </strong>He reminds us that in Mike Brearley\u2019s day \u201ctalk about his selection for his captaincy, not his batting.

I don\u2019t know his character as well as you, but if the offer was made, do you really think he\u2019d say \u2018No\u2019? In general terms, elite sportsmen aren\u2019t exactly well known for an ability to recognise their own limitations, or to turn down extra prestige. And in specific terms, he\u2019s come back and proven his point (fairly emphatically!) with the bat, might he be tempted by the redemptive arc of a second term of office?\u201d</p> <p>If they ask, I suppose he would accept? Nobody has put that to him yet but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll become a talking point. He averages 74 since August 2013, all his 26 tons coming in his last 99 innings. Just let him bat, I say.

Could they get a win in their third ever start? Away from home, no less? What a story that would be.</p> <p>This is a very good email from Scott Roberts. <br></p> <p>\u201cFollowing on from Neil Harris\u2019s excellent point (10:39) about how much we miss Jimmy Anderson (and maybe as crucially as Australia missed Glenn McGrath for those key games in 2005), I have a theory that the symbiotic relationship between Jimmy and Broady resembles that of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in the 90s.\u201d</p> <p>Oooh, please continue. <br></p> <p>\u201cI personally think we overrate Broad in much the same way that Pippen was lauded as one of the best players in the NBA at the time (and was voted as one the 50 greatest ever), as both Broad and Pippen rely/relied on and benefitted from playing with those legends. It\u2019s noticeable, to me at least, that when Broad doesn\u2019t have Jimmy controlling the other end, he becomes less effective because batsmen take fewer risks against him, because they don\u2019t have to anymore. So when Jimmy does retire I will be interested in how Broad fares (although he could then also have the assistance of Jofra Archer in that role), as Pippen was exposed as not being the all-round great player he was supposed to be when MJ retired (both the first and second time).\u201d</p> <p>What works against this (nice) theory is that Broad has a top record when Anderson isn\u2019t in the XI. He tends to enjoy the added responsibility of being the legitimate attack-leader. Has he ever bowled better across a series than what we\u2019ve seen so far here?<br></p> <p>\u201cI was interested watching the highlights to see how many chances (including play-and-misses) Smith offered,\u201d sniffs David Murray. \u201cWhile a great innings, it wasn\u2019t flawless. It makes me curious how many chances and balls beating the bat does a good century normally include? How many does a bowler need on average to get a wicket? We see some batsman beaten over and over again but surviving (e.g. Burns in this series). Is there somehow some skill in this or is it just luck?\u201d</p> <p>Playing and missing isn\u2019t always due to batsman error - bowlers are allowed to beat the bat. There\u2019s a skill in not following the ball with your hands, which Warner showed quite well at Leeds last week. On your question about chances per ton, I reckon that\u2019s something CricViz probably keep an eye on, but it\u2019s very subjective. As Michael Vaughan said in his spot with me last night, those who can\u2019t appreciate the artistry in what Smith is doing are missing out.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d72393d8f08143ee1ae1394\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T10:52:03.907Z\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Off come the covers again. </strong>I\u2019m not sure why, given they are going to push for an early lunch.

The ball doesn\u2019t have to come down from a great height, as we can\u2019t all be Joel Garner or Curtly Ambrose; anyway, good though they were, other West Indians were quicker, more accurate bowlers.

I really don\u2019t wish to sound like a broken record, but why we have such a mental block that creates such brainless bowling at Steve Smith baffles me. </p> <p>Look (to paraphrase an Australian), it\u2019s unlikely, especially on a flat pitch that you\u2019re going to get Smith out using conventional methods such as bowling in the channel, as he obviously has a great eye and defence and is not going to go chasing the ball to create nicks. He uses the leg-theory law to his advantage (much like Graeme Smith, who we also bowled dreadfully at), as he knows that he can walk across his stumps and flick the ball behind square on the legside with a maximum of three fielders back there, meaning that the danger involved is minimal (yes, you could have a leg slip, but the downside of a leg slip is that they are unsighted until the ball suddenly flies at them). So what is Steve Smith\u2019s weakness? He hates not scoring. You could see it late yesterday afternoon when Craig Overton, briefly, decided to bowl wide of off stump; Smith hated it and started playing wild shots and was walking way across to the offside to try to manufacture something, suddenly becoming vulnerable. But then we suddenly decided to not do that anymore. Why? Why such lack of patience from an international team? Either bowl wide of off stump with an offside field OR bowl very straight with a strong legside field, but either way, STICK TO THE PLAN!! I would even ask Leachy to bowl very wide over the wicket in the footholes with a packed legside field. No, there\u2019s no chance of lbw, but can Smith really resist taking a huge risk and not trying to smash the ball for a boundary when his scoring rate has come to a halt?\u201d </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d721e978f082514879eef80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-06T09:16:26.319Z\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Peter Bellew. \u201cThe stars have finally aligned and I have managed be working from home this Friday.

      "bodyText": "Close of play That, officially, is that for the day. We\u2019ll have a match report from Old Trafford shortly. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Despite the irritating end, that\u2019s been another excellent day for Australia. Pat Cummins\u2019 immense 10-over spell either side of tea increased the pressure on England, and Josh Hazlewood reaped the rewards with three late wickets. He took all four wickets to fall today, in fact. England, who need a further 98 to avoid the follow-on, are in serious trouble, again. \u201cSport on TV being that nebulous, fuzzy thing in the 80s, I didn\u2019t get to watch Abdul Qadir \u201clive\u201d - only in highlights on World of Sport or similar,\u201d says Ben Heywood. \u201cMy brother and I were so amazed by Qadir\u2019s loopy deliveries that we resolved to teach ourselves leg spin in the back garden, bowling at two flowerpots stacked on top of each other with a tennis ball. My attempted leg-breaks flew straight up in the air. My brother\u2019s, upsettingly, seemed to unerringly bounce and spit out of the rough that comprised most of my Dad\u2019s lawn, but he did slightly ruin the effect by running twice around the greenhouse first in an attempt to emulate that famous run-up. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019d have been allowed on a cut strip... RIP Abdul. Gorgeous action.\u201d Bad light stops play Australia aren\u2019t happy. Tim Paine was told he could bowl spin at both ends, but the umpires changed their mind after checking the light meter. 74th over: England 200-5 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 2) With the forecast good for the next two days, England are in the nasty stuff. It\u2019s no good just avoiding the follow on, because that would leave Australia with plenty of time to win the match. It\u2019s hard to see a way out. Let\u2019s be honest, Australia fully deserve to win the series, never mind retain the Ashes. \u201cNo bowler made a batsman look a mug the way Abdul Qadir did,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cHe attacked with every ball and bowled about as dry as me. So very sad.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s the deception that made him so bewildering. 73rd over: England 198-5 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 2) It was an ugly lunge towards the ball by Roy, which left a big gate for Hazlewood to burst through. It was a brilliant delivery. \u201cTwo things in that Abdul Qadir clip,\u201d says Kristian Petterson. \u201cFirstly, I love Richie saying \u2018Oh, what a Bosie!\u2019 Shameful that Bosie has gone out of fashion. Secondly, Gabriel appears to get out exactly the same way twice - going back to try to cut the wrong \u2018un - in the same ODI series. What a dummy!\u201d Hazlewood gets his fourth wicket, knocking Roy\u2019s middle stump out of the ground with a big nipbacker. Roy played some nice strokes, including a lovely back-foot drive for four off the previous delivery, but Hazlewood ended the argument in the most emphatic manner. And it\u2019s goodnight from him. 72nd over: England 190-4 (Roy 18, Stokes 3) Stokes survives an appeal for caught behind after an impressive bit of juggling from Paine. It missed the edge. \u201cIt\u2019d be wrong to say I\u2019m looking forward to reading Abdul Qadir\u2019s obituary in tomorrow\u2019s Guardian, but I\u2019ll be disappointed if there isn\u2019t one,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cHe was one of the greats and should be recognised as such.\u201d Yes, agreed. He was a genius. 71st over: England 190-4 (Roy 18, Stokes 3) An excellent short ball from Hazlewood is gloved round the corner for a single by Stokes; Roy then misses a swipe across the line. He has 18 from 29 balls, and there have been signs of encouragement amid the false strokes. \u201cAs a nine-year-old watching his first ever Test series on TV in 1982, I remember being mesmerised by Qadir\u2019s whirling action and finger-licking,\u201d says Paul Callinan. \u201cI was also confused and a bit upset that our batsmen were unable to lay a bat on him. I don\u2019t think that any bowler since then has amazed me in quite the same way as he did back then.\u201d 70th over: England 189-4 (Roy 18, Stokes 2) Roy drives Lyon crisply through extra cover for three; Stokes is then beaten by a jaffa. If England lose any more wickets before the second new ball, they will be in serious bother. 69th over: England 183-4 (Roy 14, Stokes 0) Roy is starting to look a little more confident. He played a nice stroke for four off Lyon a couple of overs ago, which I forgot to report after reading about Abdul Qadir. \u201cI\u2019m sad to see that Abdul Qadir has died,\u201d says Chris Howell. \u201cIt\u2019s something of a mystery to me that I grew up on the late 80s to become a huge cricket fan, since my earliest cricketing memory is of losing to India and NZ at home in the summer of 1986, followed losing to pretty much everyone else until 1990. But I remember being enchanted watching Abdul Qadir bowl in 1987, and taking myself into the back garden to try to teach myself how to bowl legspin. I suspect that he as much as anyone made me want to watch and learn about this great game.\u201d I think Graham Gooch said he was the best spinner he ever faced, even ahead of Shane Warne. Here\u2019s a small sample of Abdul Qadir\u2019s genius. His googly, in particular, was a thing of beauty. Man, this is awful news. 68th over: England 180-4 (Roy 12, Stokes 0) Awful news from Pakistan: Abdul Qadir, the legspin genius of the 1980s, has died at the age of 63. That\u2019s shocking news. 67th over: England 175-4 (Roy 7, Stokes 0) Roy got off the mark in style earlier in the over, driving Hazlewood sweetly to the extra-cover boundary. Incidentally, there was a typo in the 63rd over - I should have said that it\u2019s only the second time Root has faced at least 150 balls in consecutive Test innings. We\u2019ve seen that dismissal before with Root against Australia, trapped LBW as he falls over towards the off side. The ball nipped back and maybe kept a bit low. Root was so plumb that he barely even considered a review. Root has been pinned LBW by Hazlewood! 66th over: England 167-3 (Root 70, Roy 0) Roy gropes hopefully at his first ball from Lyon, inside-edging it back onto the body. He shapes to hammer the last delivery of the over through the off side, sees it start to turn big and aborts the shot. Lyon looks at him with contempt. \u201cFine,\u201d says Sumit Rahman. \u201cBroad as captain, but Buttler in charge of reviews. Now everyone has a role.\u201d And a specialist DRS coach in the dressing-room. 65th over: England 166-3 (Root 69, Roy 0) Jason Roy inside-edges his first ball back onto the pad. He is under so much pressure, having made 19 runs his last four innings. His joyous evisceration of the Aussies in the World Cup semi-final must feel a long time ago. Rory Burns\u2019 fine innings is over. He edged a good delivery from Hazlewood towards second slip, where the inevitable Steve Smith took a sharp tumbling catch. It was a really good piece of bowling from Hazlewood - a perfect length, and with just enough movement off the seam to take the edge. A big wicket for Australia! 64th over: England 166-2 (Burns 81, Root 69) Burns flat-bats Lyon this far short of Wade, swooping forward at cover. At first I thought it was a dropped chance, but replays suggest it bounced a fraction in front of Wade. \u201cI wonder,\u201d says Geoff Wignall, \u201cwas 67 all out the salvation of this England side?\u201d I\u2019m not sure they are good enough to make it a salvation, but there has been a notable change of approach. 63rd over: England 165-2 (Burns 80, Root 69) Cummins is replaced by Hazlewood, who bowls a maiden to Root. He has 69 from 161 balls. This is only the second time in Root\u2019s Test career that he has faced at least 150 balls in consecutive Test innings, a reflection of his increased resolve. Runs are not coming easily, which in many ways makes his performance even more impressive. 62nd over: England 165-2 (Burns 80, Root 69) A top-edged sweep from Burns teases fine leg before dropping well short. England take a single, the first of four from the over. They need another 133 runs to avoid the follow-on. \u201cCan we stop with the captaincy hot takes?\u201d says David Hart. \u201cRoot is still our best bat, he\u2019s a decent leader, respected by the players, and his overall record is good (we drubbed India last year - Kohli still seems to be hanging on). People who want to humiliate him by making Eoin Morgan - a guy who barely plays red ball cricket - captain are eating the sky-iest pie ever. It\u2019s not Root\u2019s fault England can\u2019t find two openers, Anderson spangled himself and Buttler seems to have lost his bottle, any more than Tim Paine is a great leader if/when Smith wins them the series. ROOOO-OOOOT.\u201d You\u2019re not looking at the whole pie. 61st over: England 161-2 (Burns 78, Root 67) Cummins continues; this is his 10th over in this spell. The man\u2019s an animal. Burns defends most of the over before turning a single off the pads. England may have seen Cummins off. \u201cI\u2019m sat in my office in Manchester looking out over a very grey sky over Old Trafford in a funk after a few days in Paris eating my body weight in patisserie and cheese washed down with heavenly red wine,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cThe comedown is real, almost as difficult as being in the field yesterday when a week earlier it was The Headingley Experience. It would SO English to give us that miracle then fritter away the Ashes in the next 24 hours. Surely an incentive in itself for stubbornness?\u201d 60th over: England 160-2 (Burns 77, Root 67) A maiden from Lyon to Root. Thanks for all your pitch suggestions, which I\u2019ve forwarded to Sam. 59th over: England 160-2 (Burns 77, Root 67) Root is beaten again by the luckless Cummins, who follows up with a big inducker that Root gets a bat on at the last minute. Cummins\u2019 figures in this spell are 9-2-21-0. 58th over: England 159-2 (Burns 77, Root 66) 57th over: England 158-2 (Burns 77, Root 65) Burns survives a run-out chance after taking a dodgy single off Cummins. He would have been well short had Head\u2019s throw hit the stumps. Burns then fences another nasty lifter in the air on the off side, but it falls short of Lyon. Cummins doesn\u2019t deserve a wicket in this spell; he deserves two or three. 56th over: England 154-2 (Burns 74, Root 64) \u201cI like a bowler as captain,\u201d says Sam Collier, \u201cbut do we really want Broad in charge of DRS?\u201d Now that\u2019s what I call a fair point. 55th over: England 151-2 (Burns 73, Root 62) Root continues, and Cummins continues to rough him up. The first ball after the break thuds into the glove, with Root taking his eye off the ball. This is blistering Test cricket. \u201cThe way things are going,\u201d says Bobby Dunnett, \u201cJason Roy could still be facing the new ball early in his innings.\u201d Help! department \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Sam Wrighton. \u201cOur final league game of the year is tomorrow. We\u2019re (Hackney CC) 2nd, playing 1st (London Fields CC). Winner takes the league. We\u2019ve just got an email from the council saying some Travellers are on the pitch and our game is in danger of being cancelled. Anyone know of a pitch we can use in London please?!\u201d If anyone can help, please get in touch and I\u2019ll forward it on to Sam. 54.4 overs: England 151-2 (Burns 73, Root 62) Root edges Cummins wide of second slip for four. I think it would have dropped short but it was another sharp delivery from Cummins, who has bowled gloriously either side of tea. The harder the yakka, the higher he rolls his sleeves. He\u2019s a captain\u2019s dream. There\u2019s a break in play while Root receives treatment, having been hit on the knee by Cummins. He\u2019s in a fair bit of pain. Root is not out! Bumble knows. It was a fine delivery from Cummins, which turned Root round and rammed into the back pad as he pushed down the wrong line. It does look too high \u2013 and it also hit him outside the line. Australia lose a review. Root survives a huge LBW shout - but Australia review! Bumble reckons it\u2019s too high; I reckon it\u2019s very close. 54th over: England 147-2 (Burns 73, Root 58) Burns dumps a slog-sweep to the midwicket boundary to move into the seventies. There has been so much to admire in this partnership, even though they have both had moments of fortune. Burns\u2019 shot selection has been almost immaculate. 53rd over: England 143-2 (Burns 69, Root 58) A big let-off for Root! Cummins found the edge with a gorgeous outswinger that Root tried to flick to leg, and the ball went straight between Warner at first slip and Paine for four. They both left it to each other. This is a sensational old-ball spell from Cummins. \u201cCaptaincy,\u201d says Kristian Petterson. \u201cI know it\u2019s almost heresy but might it be worth considering a - whisper it - bowler?\u201d Yes, I think Broad for a couple of years isn\u2019t a terrible idea, but there would be issues with rotation. I haven\u2019t a clue. Sod it, give it to Rob Key. 52nd over: England 135-2 (Burns 69, Root 50) Root works Lyon for a single to reach a dogged half-century from 117 balls. It\u2019s the first time since the 2017-18 Ashes that he has reached fifty in consecutive Test innings; a reflection, perhaps, of a greater over-my-dead-body mentality since the 67 all out fiasco. 51st over: England 133-2 (Burns 68, Root 49) \u201cI know it is Manchester &amp; all,\u201d says Marie Meyer, \u201cbut what is the prospect of play on days four and five?\u201d The forecast is pretty good, with little or no rain expected. It\u2019s so easy to be lulled into a false sense of security when Tests are rain-affected, but England still have loads of work to do to save this match. 50th over: England 131-2 (Burns 67, Root 48) A ripper from Lyon beats Burns\u2019 defensive push. Paine appealed for caught behind but there was nothing from Lyon. 49th over: England 130-2 (Burns 67, Root 47) Burns is beaten by a spectacular delivery from Cummins, which seams and lifts extravagantly past the edge. This bloke is an awesome bowler. Another maiden gives him figures of 11-4-17-1. 48th over: England 130-2 (Burns 67, Root 47) Lyon starts after tea to Burns, who cuts the fourth ball emphatically through the covers for four. He\u2019s played so well today, probably better than during his century at Edgbaston. There are 41 overs still to be bowled, and play can continue until 7.30pm. Captaincy department \u201cIt just seems to me that Jos is perhaps the only person in the team who doesn\u2019t have a defined role,\u201d says Graham Currie. \u201cThe captaincy would do that for him and a little reshuffle of roles and places might mean that suddenly everyone knows what they are there to do. Currently it\u2019s all a bit mixed up and that lack of clarity seems to come through on to the field?\u201d My main concern with Buttler is that he will soon be needed to captain the white-ball teams, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea to ask him to do all three. There\u2019s also the fact his Test place isn\u2019t guaranteed, although that\u2019s the case for most of the team. Rory Burns might be an option in a year\u2019s time; but he might also be back playing county cricket, after averaging 7.25 in South Africa. Nobody knows anything. But in the time I\u2019ve been watching English cricket, 31 big ones, I can\u2019t remember a time when there were so few persuasive options for the Test captaincy. \u201cRe: Simon Gates\u2019 email in the 45th over,\u201d begins David Horn. \u201cClearly Mr Broad shared the common view that he was not going to be there long enough to break sweat, and indeed he was extremely prescient!\u201d 47th over: England 125-2 (Burns 62, Root 47) Pat Cummins is so good at cranking things up when Australia really need a wicket. His pace has gone from 85mph to 90mph+ in the space of two overs, and he almost finds the edge with a superb full-length delivery that beats Root\u2019s attempted drive. The next delivery also beats Root, who is hanging on for the tea break. And he makes it. But that was a majestic over from Cummins. 46th over: England 125-2 (Burns 62, Root 47) Nathan Lyon returns in place of Josh Hazlewood, which means huge cheers every time he catches the ball or picks it up. It was gently amusing the first time. Burns cuts for two, which brings up a vital century partnership from 204 balls. 45th over: England 123-2 (Burns 60, Root 47) Burns does well to drop a vicious lifter to safety on the off side. Cummins is bowling with menacing intent, particularly to Burns. Ten minutes to go until tea. \u201cAs everyone\u2019s still talking about Headingley, something in England\u2019s second innings puzzled me,\u201d says Simon Gates. \u201cStuart Broad appeared to be batting in a T-shirt, shirt and sweater, on one of the hottest days of the year. I know he\u2019s pretty cool, but does he actually have his own microclimate?\u201d 44th over: England 122-2 (Burns 59, Root 47) This is fascinating stuff; there\u2019s no doubt England have tried to play with more patience and discipline since the 67 all out. And when Hazlewood drops short, Root slams a beautiful swivel-pull through square leg for four. Apart from that hairy spell against Lyon, he has played superbly. 43rd over: England 118-2 (Burns 59, Root 43) Starc off, Cummins on, which means some rough stuff for Rory Burns. He ignores a couple of short balls, defends the fuller deliveries, and I don\u2019t know what else to tell you. 42nd over: England 117-2 (Burns 59, Root 42) Root tries to glide another boundary to third man, this time off Hazlewood, and Harris swoops to his left to make a good stop. Although England are still a long way from safety, their approach so far has been spot on. \u201cAfter the histrionics of Headingley Sunday, this Friday at Old Trafford is developing with a pleasing tranquility, almost deliciously dull by comparison,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cI am tangentially reminded of Catch-22\u2019s Dunbar explaining why he loved the tedium of skeet shooting (which he hated) because it made time pass so slowly. When challenged by an incredulous Clevinger about why he would want a life extended at the price of long periods of boredom he replies, \u2018What else is there?\u2019 Fortunately we have the OBO to enliven proceedings ...\u201d Boredom or suffering, those are the options. 41st over: England 116-2 (Burns 59, Root 41) That\u2019s a lovely shot from Root, who deliberately guides Starc to third man for four. He\u2019s nowhere near his best, but his focus and determination in the last two innings have been very impressive. I think a switch went off in his head after the 67 all out. Burns survives an LBW appeal later in the over after walking across his stumps to a full delivery. It was missing leg. 40th over: England 111-2 (Burns 59, Root 36) Hazlewood, on for Lyon, is flicked behind square for two by Burns. A quiet over ends with a false stroke from Burns, who fresh-airs an attempted hook stroke. \u201cJust wanted to build on your earlier point about Burns appearing better than his average,\u201d says Phil Reilly. \u201cAlthough this is his 11th Test, the first 6 were played away from home, and he\u2019d never played any cricket outside England before. Lots of good batsmen have ordinary records away from home, so I think that average is reasonable. Since his failure against Ireland, he\u2019s averaged over 45. Small sample size, but he\u2019s shown in the last few matches why he\u2019s made so many runs at county level. Hopefully, a run in the side will help him add a bit of consistency and improve his overseas form.\u201d 39th over: England 109-2 (Burns 57, Root 36) \u201cGood morning/afternoon from Colin\u2019s father (over 24),\u201d says Dominic Madigan. \u201cThe wonderful thing about a new cricket fan is the hope. He was glued to the last day at Headingley, when his Bad Englishman father was mowing the lawn until nearly the end. And with that, a question - on our next trip back, what\u2019s the best cricket ground for Colin\u2019s first match?\u201d Well, Canterbury\u2019s my favourite ground, but that\u2019s just nostalgia. All the Test grounds are great in different ways. 38.4 overs: England 109-2 (Burns 57, Root 36) Starc is always a wicket-taking threat, even when he\u2019s bowling poorly. He threatens something else when he hits Root flush in the box, knocking him off his feet. There\u2019s a break in play while Root waits for a new box to be brought onto the field. 38th over: England 109-2 (Burns 57, Root 36) The crowd are roaring every time a fielder returns the ball to Lyon. It\u2019s just banter; nothing vicious. One from the over. Ordinarily, Lyon would want to bowl to the left-hander, but he\u2019ll want Root on strike as much as possible in the next hour. Here\u2019s Graham Currie. \u201cIt seems that we have a struggling captain that wants to play at No4 and has the potential to be one of the top three batsmen in the world but is having to play at No3 because there is no other No3; a wicket keeper who isn\u2019t the best wicket keeper and actually was pretty bloody good at No3 when he wasn\u2019t doing the thing he isn\u2019t the best at; the best wicket keeper not playing despite having a pretty handy Test average and finally Jos Buttler in the team, struggling a bit to justify his inclusion, but apparently being regarded as a very good cricket captain? I dunno, seems like there might be a solution in there somewhere?\u201d There might be a needle in that haystack, too. A few months ago I liked the idea of Buttler as captain, but now he can\u2019t buy a run. I\u2019ve no idea any more. If Eoin Morgan had a better back, I\u2019d give it to him in a heartbeat. Of course, England might win the Ashes 2-1, in which case Root will definitely continue. 37th over: England 107-2 (Burns 57, Root 35) A better over from Starc, just one from it. 36th over: England 107-2 (Burns 57, Root 34) Root inside-edges Lyon for four, just past off stump. It was another big off-break from Lyon, and a lazy dab from Root. He was so lucky to get away with that. Burns wanted to steal a single off the next ball but was sent back by Root. He was home when Lyon collected Warner\u2019s throw, a clean take that brought a huge, sarcastic cheer from the home fans. Lyon held the ball up to acknowledge the recognition of his Headingley cock-up. 35th over: England 102-2 (Burns 57, Root 29) This is crap from Starc, who has conceded 22 in two overs since returning to the attack. Burns forces him for three; Root tucks a poor delivery off the hip for four and clips three more off the pads. 34th over: England 94-2 (Burns 54, Root 22) Root sweeps Lyon round the corner for a couple. He\u2019s straining to find some safe release shots against Lyon, and later in the over he takes a quick single on the off side. \u201cHi, Rob,\u201d says Smylers. \u201cCongratulations on your \u2018prediction\u2019 towards the end of the Saturday at Headingley of England winning by one wicket at 4.21pm the following day \u2014 within five minutes of what did transpire! How did you do it, and care to make a similar prophecy for this match?\u201d Crikey, I don\u2019t even remember that. 33rd over: England 88-2 (Burns 53, Root 19) Starc, on for Hazlewood, is square-driven emphatically for four by Burns. That was a beautiful back-foot stroke, which he follows with an edge to the third-man boundary to reach an excellent half-century. That last shot was safe enough, played with soft hands so that it dropped well short of the cordon. Burns\u2019 stats are modest - he averages 30 from 11 Tests - but he\u2019s got the temperament of a Test batsman and he\u2019ll surely stay in the team for the winter. 32nd over: England 76-2 (Burns 41, Root 19) Root is struggling against Lyon. He inside-edges an attempted slap through the covers, with the ball whistling just past leg stump. Lyon gives him a knowing look; he\u2019s all over Root just now. \u201cI know some might consider it techno cricket,\u201d begins Jeremy Dresner. \u201cHowever, my local ten-pin bowling alley has the ability to monitor feet over the line using some sort of computer device since the 1990s. Perhaps this wizardry could be the answer for cricket!\u201d Or we could just get Walter Sobchak to do some umpiring. (NB: Clip contains adult language.) 31st over: England 75-2 (Burns 40, Root 19) Burns is beaten, fencing at a back-of-a-length delivery from Hazlewood, and then he wears a short one on the body. He\u2019s a fighter, though, and that\u2019s the best England have got. He works Hazlewood off the pads for three to bring up a dogged fifty partnership. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. This is a compelling struggle, especially between Lyon and Root. The pitch is already turning appreciably, so Lyon has a great chance to turn his Headingley mess into nothing more than a detail. Root, meanwhile, might be batting for his job. 30th over: England 70-2 (Burns 35, Root 19) Burns pushes the first ball of Lyon\u2019s over to cover, Root getting to the drinks break after prompting some activity around the bat when his inside edge is found. This contest has been the highlight of the session so far. \u201c100 e-mails about Tendulker and Kohli? I\u2019d be surprised if it was that few,\u201d notes Pay Stephen, before the kicker: \u201cAnd now you are going to get one about I.V.A. Richards and Brian Lara.\u201d The debate that will roll on forever. And with that, I\u2019m handing the baton to the best in the business: Rob Smyth. Have nice weekends! 29th over: England 69-2 (Burns 34, Root 19) Not Hazlewood\u2019s best set, a couple of times misdirecting into Burns\u2019 pads, but the opener doesn\u2019t take advantage. They clearly think the short ball is going to sort him out, and maybe they\u2019re right, but he wants none of it. The data from the county championship says that he doesn\u2019t fancy the hook. Oh, I neglected to note that England went beyond 67! Hurrah! 28th over: England 68-2 (Burns 33, Root 19) Lyon better; Root watchful. He gets one to really bite at the start of the over, so the England captain elects to go back to full-defensive mode. Maiden. 27th over: England 68-2 (Burns 33, Root 19) Hazlewood is brought back after a fairly short break, following Cummins from the Statham End this time around. But Burns picks up where Root left off in the previous couple of overs, taking a ball from his armpit down to the long-leg boundary. Nothing wrong with that. Of course, Hazlewood is immediately back to where he does his most dangerous work. \u201cWhat if,\u201d Richard Woods poses, \u201cthe umpire had not called Mohammed Amir\u2019s no balls?\u201d Good point. Although, the issue with them not watching the front line as they once did is a more modern problem. The Voges no-ball that wasn\u2019t - costing New Zealand 200ish runs - must have played a role in how umpires now operate. 26th over: England 64-2 (Burns 29, Root 19) Lyon misses his mark to Root as well, turned very fine for a third boundary in eight balls for England. That helps. The hosts aren\u2019t going to win this Test but they will probably need to bat a great many overs to save it. 25th over: England 59-2 (Burns 28, Root 15) Cummins slips here, undoing quite a lot of good work since he and Lyon patnered up. First, he misdirects a full ball at Root, deflecting fine for four leg byes. He then feeds him a half volley on leg stump, from which the captain helps himself to another boundary. The crowd are involved. 24th over: England 51-2 (Burns 28, Root 11) Yep, Lyon is on it here. Nice drift, enough turn, hitting his length. Root has to get well forward to make sure he doesn\u2019t get himself into strife and does it handily before keeping the strike with a tuck into the legside. \u201cI am a 16 year old from America who is just getting into cricket after watching the World Cup and the match in Leeds last month,\u201d writes Colin Madigan. WELCOME TO THE FAMILY! \u201cAs a relatively new fan, I\u2019m curious to see what are your thoughts about how Steve Smith matches up against some of the best batsmen of all time? Would he make your top 5 list? On a second note, my dad got into the blog 10 years ago, would I become the first legacy to make it?\u201d Not sure if you are the first legacy but let\u2019s say you are. Well done. As for Smith, he is statistically the second best player of all time. That\u2019ll do for me, given this has overwhelmingly been a bowling era. I\u2019m now going to get 100 emails about Virat Kohli and 100 more about Sachin Tendkular, but it\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take. But overall, Colin, I would caution against comparing players across eras. 23rd over: England 50-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) What do you know, a no-ball called when Cummins is seen to overstep by Umpire Dharmasena. He\u2019s keen on the short ball to Burns, the man he had out at Leeds hooking in the first innings there. Australia have a leg gully and a short leg in for that but the left-hander now wants nothing to do with it, getting under each bumper. Good cricket. 22nd over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) Back to back maidens; that\u2019s the ticket. Lyon v Root should again be a good contest. 21st over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) Two maidens on the bounce from Cummins to begin, this time to Burns. In addition to attacking the channel outside the off-stump, he\u2019s also got the short ball in operation for the first time today, causing the opener a spot of bother from the final ball when it spit back towards his chest. \u201cTV just showed a replay of Cummins bowling to Burns,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cWhat do you know - a big and uncalled no-ball.\u201d The same old problem with the umpires no longer checking, and fair enough too given the slack way it is all handled. Thankfully, the ICC are going back to the well with their plans to improve the process with the third umpire, in keeping with their 2016 trial. At last! Posting the overseas TMS link again. A reminder that the easy way to find this if we aren\u2019t around on the OBO is going to the BBC cricket commentary page and clicking on \u201clisten to TMS overseas.\u201d 20th over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) Nathan \u201cNathan\u201d Lyon into the attack for the first time today, from the Anderson End. They like the match-up with the off-spinner bowling at Burns with a relatively new and hard ball. Within two deliveries he finds the edge, albeit played down with soft enough hands. Silly point is in the game soon enough too - a couple of times. He keeps the strike with a tickle behind square. No issues with Lyon finding his range there. 19th over: England 48-2 (Burns 27, Root 10) Cummins is immediately where he needs to be, in keeping with the plan that Australia took to Edgbaston. He\u2019s giving Root nothing to begin before finding his inside edge then beating him on the outside of the bat. Class. 18th over: England 48-2 (Burns 27, Root 10) Hazlewood doesn\u2019t suffer from the same impatience, banging away at Root just outside the off-stump before bringing one back that spits off the pad for a leg bye. His first misdirected delivery of the day to finish, down the legside at Burns. Looks like Paine is dragging Starc for Cummins. 17th over: England 47-2 (Burns 27, Root 10) A window into why Starc hasn\u2019t played until now, backing up an excellent previous over with a loose one. Burns makes no mistake when receiving a shin-high full toss, smashing it away to the cover rope, then clipping a ball from outside leg for two more. In response, instead of going back to the length that served him well in the previous set, he has a pop at two yorkers, one kept out then the other tucked away for another couple. 16th over: England 39-2 (Burns 19, Root 10) Hazlewood\u2019s interrogation of Root continues, the England captaining dealing with the first half of the over conservatively then backing his quick hands to steer a boundary past point, moving him into double figures. The big quick bounces back with a ball that jags back but is sliding down. 15th over: England 35-2 (Burns 19, Root 6) Starc\u2019s best over so far, breaking Burns\u2019 concentration when beating him early in the over with a good\u2019un. He took a swipe at one he needed to leave from the penultimate ball then was sorted out with another to finish. \u201cI suppose you could call that nightwatchman\u2019s innings Overton\u2019s Window,\u201d says John Starbuck. A lot bigger than it once was. 14th over: England 35-2 (Burns 19, Root 6) Oooh, Hazlewood is right on the money here. He has Root driving to begin, a ball he should have left well alone and was fortunate not to edge. He leaves the next two very close to that off-stump, the second of which sailed just over the off-stump. Good batting, really. Or judgment, at least. Root is back on the drive later in the over, recording an all run four out to the western stand. Sure enough, Hazlewood beats him again to finish, a delivery that keeps a fraction low if anything. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying these Office comparisons but surely Broad is Ricky Howard, the intern?\u201d says James Butler. I had Ricky as Ansari due to their big brains, but I can see the likeness. 13th over: England 31-2 (Burns 19, Root 2) Beautiful shot, Burns stroking Starc through cover point for the first boundary of the day. Lovely balance. Another pretty good over from Starc, though, beating the opener early on and keeping him playing straight. 12th over: England 26-2 (Burns 15, Root 1) As Nasser notes on telly, the captain Root is back where he likes to bat : No4. He is off the mark first ball, albeit off an inside edge. Burns is beaten by a very handy delivery to finish, moving away a treat from the southpaw. \u201cOne fast bowler who did not do the job as captain regularly, but was rather successful when he did, was F S Trueman!\u201d recalls Ian Andrew. \u201cHis successes included beating Australia!\u201d Tour game, 1964 or something like that? What a brilliant stat this is on Rory Burns, which says a lot about this very weird series for batsmen from both sides. It takes Hazlewood only three balls to locate Overton\u2019s edge, taken with ease by Smith at second slip. He did his job as nightwatchman. 11th over: England 23-1 (Burns 15, Overton 3) Starc\u2019s first ball is on the legside and his second Burns has ample time to leave well short of a length, outside the off stump. His third ball is up near 90mph, closer to that off-stump. Forced to play, Burns pushes with soft hands to backward point. There\u2019s a shout for leg before with a ball that is a bit quicker and swings a tad as well, but it\u2019s going down the legside. Burns defends the final ball, right on the mark. A much better over from Starc than what he sent down to begin last night. The players are back on the field! Mitch Starc has the ball in his hand, he will be bowling from the Statham End. Rory Burns (15) is on strike, England resuming on 23/1 in pursuit of Australia\u2019s 497-8 (dec). He has the nightwatchman Craig Overton (3) with him. PLAY! We\u2019re nearly there. I can see kids with flags beneath my position in the front for of the press box, which means the players can\u2019t be far away from running out for what I assume will be a long session. \u201cJust wanted to drop you a message whilst on holiday in Riga,\u201d writes Alasdair Robinson. \u201cThanks for the great coverage, I don\u2019t think cricket is on the radar in Latvia so nowhere to watch. I think my girlfriend Kate appreciated the rain delay as I haven\u2019t had my eyes glued to the phone for the entire holiday.\u201d All part of the service. \u201cOn the subject of captains, I just hope that steve Smith never gets offered the captaincy again because one gets the feeling his batting will only improve over the next year or so without any further distractions. We can count ourselves lucky to be able to watch him improve in real time.\u201d Yes to all of that. Let him bat. Just let him bat. But they won\u2019t. \u201cEngland\u2019s morning,\u201d notes Adam Hirst. It sure was. Mark Gillespie wants justice for Ben Foakes. \u201cThey missed the trick a second time in the winter in SL and the WI. While the two changes didn\u2019t completely overlap, he played a number of games at 3, while Foakes kept wicket. Bairstow averaged ~40 from number 3, with a century and a half century. Foakes batting record was roughly the same in both respects, and he kept impeccably. I\u2019ve yet to hear any reason whatsoever why they reverted back, although one rumour/perception (for which i have no evidence) has been that he threw his toys out of the pram. Whatever the reasons, Foakes (who is a superior keeper) was treated abominably.\u201d The most balanced England side surely has him in it. Who knows. Meanwhile, a very Australians-on-tour moment just then. A lovely email from Konstanze Kwiet. \u201cI teach History and Legal Studies at a Western Sydney high school and my cricket-mad students are trying to distract me. Me: \u201cWhat regional and global situations threaten peace and security? Yr 12: \u201cBroad to Warner?\u201d Me: \u201cWhat did Britain fear in the pre-WWI period?\u201d Yr 9: \u201cSteve Smith batting.\u201d Love reading the OBO. All the best.\u201d Thanks for being part of it! I\u2019m giving Scott Roberts a right-of-reply because Richard Dennis gave him a clip. But this is my last Pippen-related email. Today, at least. \u201cFirstly, I didn\u2019t say that Pippen wasn\u2019t a great defensive player, and he\u2019s jumped to the conclusion that my only criteria for being a great player is being able to score, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Pippen clearly was a great defender, but he couldn\u2019t carry a team. You can\u2019t argue with the fact that when he lost MJ he didn\u2019t stand a chance of winning, and clearly didn\u2019t win, even with those stacked Houston &amp; Portland teams he played with after the Bulls.\u201d Moving back to Warnie, here is Ian Forth. \u201cIs it a fevered dream or do you recall the poolroom mural of his in which he can be seen in deep conversation with The Boss about his flipper? A naked Angelina Jolie, a left handed Elvis and Mad Jack with a slab of VBs also featured from tortured memory (don\u2019t make me look it up). And Chris Martin playing poker, just to take things up to the next level.\u201d What, you mean one of the best days of my life on the internet? OBO-regular Nick Toovey unlocked this at the time, his video going uber-viral of the clip on Sky Cricket. Tom Cowie, of The Age and White Line Wireless then worked out every participant. Wonderful times. \u201cRather than MJ/Pippen,\u201d begins Norval Scott, \u201ca better comparison for Broad/Anderson is another great combo: Glenn McGrath and Dizzy Gillespie. One partner is the metronome that gives you nothing, while the other is streakier, could still run through you on their own on a good day, but also could lose their line or length and get hit about a bit when they tried to do too much. Broad and Gillespie\u2019s bowling and batting averages aren\u2019t that far apart either (obviously I\u2019m not claiming Anderson was as good as McGrath).\u201d I can\u2019t sign up to that. Data like this wasn\u2019t kept then, but Gillespie was one of Australia\u2019s most accurate bowlers. He was faster than McGrath, and fell away suddenly in 2005, but he was never streaky. \u201cI remember talking recently about Stokes being unable to take on the Captaincy because of the Bristol incident,\u201d says Robbie Chedburn, \u201cbut I would argue he has redeemed himself with the World Cup and Headingley performances. If Rooty does end up going Stokes could be the man, couldn\u2019t he?\u201d A little bit like Warner: he\u2019s the best available option but has all that baggage. I would actually decrease Warner\u2019s leadership life ban to the same two years that Smith is serving. But it will never happen. Great news. The sun has been shining throughout the lunch interval, the cover are off and now the two teams are quickly warming up. \u201c*cough* Bob Willis *cough*,\u201d replies Mark Slater to my comment about Imran and Kapil. \u201cCertainly no worse than any other England Captain of that era, except for the ultimate specialist skipper Michael Brealey.\u201d Free the fast bowling captains! Free them all! \u201cSat here outside the ground waiting to go in,\u201d says Mark Carrington. \u201cMy mate Graham has just pointed out if play finishes at 8PM (7:30 official close + 30 mins) which is 15 minutes after sunset.\u201d That won\u2019t be quite right. The scheduled close will be 7pm, which becomes 7:30pm after the inevitable extra half an hour. Richard McConnell\u2019s perspective is in line with mine. \u201cI am always minded of the old adage about the folly of making your best operator in a factory the manager. They may not be cut out for the job, and you have also lost your best operator. The added burden of captaining does take focus from your primary role in the side. You can also see this with Bairstow when he has the gloves.\u201d They missed a trick in 2016 with YJB, for mine. That summer - his best, by a mile, with the blade - he kept poorly. This was the time to give him the big batting promotion and move the gloves elsewhere. It\u2019s difficult to see how they manage that transition now, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s an excellent \u2018keeper and wants to keep things are they are. \u201cGraham Currie (12:14) wonders why teams keep giving the captaincy to the best player,\u201d writes Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cSurely it\u2019s not so much that they give it to the best player, but to the player least likely to be dropped? I suppose you could have a series with a different captain each match, but some stability is surely desirable.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s definitely part of it. It\u2019s why Australia might have a problem as Khawaja could have been a temporary fix but he\u2019s found himself out of the XI now and, in turn, a fair way back in the pack. \u201cNine in Australia is gracing us with highlights from the 1st 1994 Test in Brisbane,\u201d reports Thomas Chick. \u201cBack in a time where shadows on text thicker than the text itself were in fashion, and when a change from, say, a score of 49 to a score of 50 would sometimes display 59 for a frame or two.\u201d Simpler times. Craig McEwan is reading in from Lima. He reminds us that in Mike Brearley\u2019s day \u201ctalk about his selection for his captaincy, not his batting. Of note, Paine has a similar Test record to him with the bat. Matt Dony, on the same topic. \u201cPretty much every Australian I\u2019ve heard on the matter has said that they hope, even if Smith was offered the captaincy, he\u2019d turn it down. I don\u2019t know his character as well as you, but if the offer was made, do you really think he\u2019d say \u2018No\u2019? In general terms, elite sportsmen aren\u2019t exactly well known for an ability to recognise their own limitations, or to turn down extra prestige. And in specific terms, he\u2019s come back and proven his point (fairly emphatically!) with the bat, might he be tempted by the redemptive arc of a second term of office?\u201d If they ask, I suppose he would accept? Nobody has put that to him yet but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll become a talking point. He averages 74 since August 2013, all his 26 tons coming in his last 99 innings. Just let him bat, I say. Leave him to finish with a Test average of 70-something. The stumps are in. The formal inspection isn\u2019t scheduled for another ten minutes but the umpires are currently out there for an ~informal~ look, Trevor Bayliss too. It feels like they\u2019ll be out there very soon. Lunch. With the weather here improving rather rapidly, I\u2019m going to take this opportunity to grab some food myself. Back soon. ... and the covers are slowly coming off again. In theory, we could see some action at 1:10pm, David Gower reckons. In reality, given how much rain there has been so far this morning, it would have to be 1:30pm at the earliest. Then again, it\u2019ll surely rain again soon. \u201cScott Roberts obviously knows nothing about Scottie Pippen,\u201d slaps Richard Dennis. \u201cHe is (and rightly so) regarded as one of the all time best defensive players in basketball history, there\u2019s more to the game than scoring buckets. And, also, Broad has been immense in this series, so even the attempted analogy makes little to no sense. Oh, and also again, 8/15. No?\u201d To quote from a terrible Australian television show, I\u2019m going to take that as a comment. \u201cHas there been an Ashes (in the covered pitches era) in which the opening batsmen on both sides have performed so poorly?\u201d asks Gavin Byrne. \u201cAn early wicket or two has seemed almost mundane in this one.\u201d You can extrapolate that to batting across the Test-playing world, according to the data. Scores haven\u2019t been this low since the 1950s. It is quite sunny at Old Trafford. Maybe we will play at 1:10pm? \u201cEngland\u2019s top order play the Slough roundabout from the original series\u2019 opening credits,\u201d says Mick Collins on our earlier topic. \u201cEveryone gets a turn.\u201d Excellent. Would you believe I took my girlfriend to Slough for a Bank Holiday last year? With Dulwich Hamlet playing there, I couldn\u2019t help myself. Took her to Pizza Express (Beer Express) for lunch. We\u2019re still together and she is now pregnant with our first child. Wonders truly never cease. \u201cI would really like some cricket,\u201d pleads Jane Evans. \u201cAmusing as all the OBO chat always is. It\u2019s my birthday on Sunday. Please may I have an Australian win? I have my English brother-in-law the World Cup for his birthday in August.\u201d HBD! The radar says we should be up and about by the middle of the day, just when Rob Smyth will arrive to take over from me. Shane Warne is discussing the tradition musicians and cricketers spending time together. \u201cHaving a drink with them and just hang.\u201d David Gower is telling stories about Elton John and George Michael. \u201cThe next Australian captain should be Marnus,\u201d suggests Anthony Noel, \u201cwho will do a Graeme Smith and get the job early in his Test career and keep on doing it for a decade. Wonder how many English captains he\u2019ll see off?\u201d I truly hope they don\u2019t do that to him. The story of Steve Smith should be etched into the brain of board members forever. \u201cJust following up on John Cox\u2019s email discussing Tim Paine,\u201d writes Graham Currie, \u201cI constantly wonder why teams DO continue with the standard protocol of making the best player the captain. It does seem rather old fashioned? It might be that the best player IS the best captain, but really you want people doing the thing that they are best at.\u201d There\u2019s also the moolah and superior hotel rooms. Not to mention the fact that, in the Australian context, you have a job commonly referred to as the second most important after that of PM. Anyone else watching this Ashes in the 1980s doco on Sky Cricket as they pass the time? Outstanding television. In Test cricket that is on at the moment. Bangladesh are in a lot of strife at Chattogram, 170/8 with half an hour to go on evening two after Afghanistan tallied 342. Could they get a win in their third ever start? Away from home, no less? What a story that would be. This is a very good email from Scott Roberts. \u201cFollowing on from Neil Harris\u2019s excellent point (10:39) about how much we miss Jimmy Anderson (and maybe as crucially as Australia missed Glenn McGrath for those key games in 2005), I have a theory that the symbiotic relationship between Jimmy and Broady resembles that of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in the 90s.\u201d Oooh, please continue. \u201cI personally think we overrate Broad in much the same way that Pippen was lauded as one of the best players in the NBA at the time (and was voted as one the 50 greatest ever), as both Broad and Pippen rely/relied on and benefitted from playing with those legends. It\u2019s noticeable, to me at least, that when Broad doesn\u2019t have Jimmy controlling the other end, he becomes less effective because batsmen take fewer risks against him, because they don\u2019t have to anymore. So when Jimmy does retire I will be interested in how Broad fares (although he could then also have the assistance of Jofra Archer in that role), as Pippen was exposed as not being the all-round great player he was supposed to be when MJ retired (both the first and second time).\u201d What works against this (nice) theory is that Broad has a top record when Anderson isn\u2019t in the XI. He tends to enjoy the added responsibility of being the legitimate attack-leader. Has he ever bowled better across a series than what we\u2019ve seen so far here? \u201cI was interested watching the highlights to see how many chances (including play-and-misses) Smith offered,\u201d sniffs David Murray. \u201cWhile a great innings, it wasn\u2019t flawless. It makes me curious how many chances and balls beating the bat does a good century normally include? How many does a bowler need on average to get a wicket? We see some batsman beaten over and over again but surviving (e.g. Burns in this series). Is there somehow some skill in this or is it just luck?\u201d Playing and missing isn\u2019t always due to batsman error - bowlers are allowed to beat the bat. There\u2019s a skill in not following the ball with your hands, which Warner showed quite well at Leeds last week. On your question about chances per ton, I reckon that\u2019s something CricViz probably keep an eye on, but it\u2019s very subjective. As Michael Vaughan said in his spot with me last night, those who can\u2019t appreciate the artistry in what Smith is doing are missing out. Off come the covers again. I\u2019m not sure why, given they are going to push for an early lunch. The wind is blowing more than day one. \u201cThe comment that the ECB picked very tall fast-medium bowlers illustrates a common error that bowlers bowl faster according to how tall they are,\u201d argues John Starbuck. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t so. Larwood (the Wrecker) stood barely 5\u20194\u201d and was probably the fastest ever produced by England, thus showing it\u2019s all about natural talent and economy of movement. The ball doesn\u2019t have to come down from a great height, as we can\u2019t all be Joel Garner or Curtly Ambrose; anyway, good though they were, other West Indians were quicker, more accurate bowlers. A good little\u2019n will usually beat a moderate big\u2019n.\u201d I\u2019ll have both, thanks! Take Josh Hazlewood. Swoon. \u201cTaking about \u2018specialist captains\u2019 if you will,\u201d tweets Alicia Daly to me. \u201cAre there other examples and how successful have they been? George Bailey comes to mind.\u201d Sadly, George is probably two years beyond the point where it\u2019d be realistic for him to come in and do this job if Paine went. I\u2019d like Pat Cummins to be invited to do it, but he won\u2019t. You know how it is: fast bowlers can\u2019t possibly captain because they are fast bowlers. Forget about Kapil Dev and Imran Khan. The covers are now back on. Why did they bother taking them off? \u201cQuick word of thanks to the sporting Gods,\u201d writes Peter Salmon, \u201cfor allowing me to watch Collingwood beating Geelong in the footy. Rain in Old Trafford til about 2pm thanks.\u201d Approximately 15 of my colleagues are huddled around a handful of iPads doing exactly the same thing. After last night\u2019s result, I\u2019m feeling very full. I don\u2019t need to see any more this weekend. On TMS, they are passing the time in the usual way: discussing the 2005 Ashes. There\u2019s nothing easy about rain fill on radio, I can tell you that much. They don\u2019t have the wonderful OBO emails. I\u2019ll take this moment to go the BBC website for the overseas TMS link. \u201cGood morning, Mr Collins.\u201d and to you, Mike Wrocock. \u201cIs it cowardly to pray for rain? You bet it is! As an Aussie, I may be likely to say that, but this is a contest - you don\u2019t want to draw, thanks to an act of God. Stokes showed if you\u2019ve got the ticker, you can beat the odds. Be brave, Root and co!\u201d The positive from this rain is it increases the likelihood of us going to South London with everything to play for. That\u2019d be pretty fun. Matt Potter is with us as well. \u201cWas thinking yesterday as Starc and Lyon were having a lovely old time in the evening session, that maybe the pitch is actually a complete road and England could bat for two days themselves? Or is it wishful thinking?\u201d I can\u2019t imagine a scenario - any scenario - where England bat for two days. They\u2019re no good. Nor are Australia, mind. But they have Smith. It\u2019s raining again. Told ya. All the covers, all the wind. Horrid. Ummm, the covers are coming off? At least a couple of them. I was under the strict impression from my rain app that we wouldn\u2019t be seeing any cricket until much later today. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re being gaslit and it\u2019ll pour down again soon enough. But this is where we\u2019re at. \u201cOn the subject of Tim Paine,\u201d begins John Cox. \u201cHe may make enough Test runs or he may not, but it was pretty obvious from his press conference after Headingley that he\u2019s an excellent captain, which is worth a lot.\u201d This is lost a bit in the discussion around the Australian captaincy. My press box colleague Dan Brettig wrote nicely about the topic last week, arguing that it doesn\u2019t work that well making the job a lucrative prize for the best player. There\u2019s more to it. Not least, serving as spokesperson, which is a bigger role than it used to be. If Paine pulls the pin at The Oval - and look, if they win in England for the first time since 2001, could you blame him for going out on top? - it will signify the end of an important period of leadership. It also puts the Australians in a tough spot for the summer, with Smith still banned from leadership until March. And would he even want to be considered for that gig again? For his sake, I hope not. We\u2019ll see. Zafar Ansari is Ricki, of course. Big brains. James Sutherland was Finchy a couple of years back - reads a book a week, don\u2019t you know. Kim Thonger has lit up my inbox for the first time today. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen The Office but I see that Jack Leach resembles Colin Robinson,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe energy sucking vampire from What We Do In The Shadows. Have they ever been seen in the same room?\u201d Very tidy. However, I\u2019m going to urge emailers not to put generic cricket lookalikes to me because we did that recently on the OBO and we all know Joe Root used to resemble Ellen DeGeneres. The sun is out at Old Trafford. Which means absolutely nothing, of course. But it\u2019d be wrong of me not to relay this information. You and me for a rainy OBO? Thank you, JP, for steering us through the tricky first hour. There won\u2019t be one of those here until deep into the afternoon. I can count 47 people toughing it out in the Temporary/Permanent Stand to my left. Good morning to you all. Ok, that\u2019s enough from me for now. Adam is in his seat in the Old Trafford media centre and he\u2019s eager to narrate rain for your delectation. I\u2019ll see you again tomorrow. Remember to retune your dials to adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com and @collinsadam. Gareth adds to the chorus of confusion over Overton\u2019s inclusion. \u201cIt reminds me a lot of the misguided selection for the 13-14 Ashes squad, where we picked medium pace tall bowlers who were apparently going to rattle Aussie helmets. Tremlett and Rankin were too slow, and Finn couldn\u2019t land it on the strip and was deemed unselectable (despite being selected). I don\u2019t understand how in Manchester, in September, with clouds all over the shop, England didn\u2019t pick a pitch-it-up specialist swing bowler when they had two (Woakes, Curran) in the squad.\u201d James Debens has offered a candidate for The Office remake. \u201cJason Roy as Lee. Not in it much, yet swaggeringly confident.\u201d Jadam Buck emails an interesting observation from the ground. \u201cAnyone else notice how many times Jofra had to pick the ball off the floor because of a poor throw when it was being returned to him at the start of his run up - mostly by Broad? One throw was so bad he even made Broad retrieve it for him. Sat in the ground watching it yesterday it was obvious that there was something amiss in how he was being treated.\u201d I missed it, but happy to take your word for it. It feeds into this Tweet from Gary Naylor: Boris Starling is sadly on the money (see here). \u201cJoe Denly as Gareth, slightly out of his depth but manfully refusing to recognise it.\u201d This is not cricket-related (unless you want to draw a long tenuous bow to the St Lawrence Lime) but it is a pleasant way to spend a few seconds while it rains in Manchester. Fun fact: I once flew to Klagenfurt with no intention of remaining there, and with no onward destination planned. Speaking of Mr Collins: Oh Ian Forth, you are going to have to refashion this email and send it again when Adam Collins is on deck. He lives for this. \u201cI take no pleasure in raising this but Craig Overton is reminding me of Finchy from the Office. Physically and in terms of his role in the series. Who else? Jason Roy as Dawn, daydreaming of a better world where his talents are recognised. Joe Root as Jennifer Taylor-Clark, frustrated by his direct reports\u2019 wilful lack of responsibility. Ed Smith as Neil - turning up in a nice suit from Swindon. Jack Leach as Keith from Accounts, obviously.\u201d Stuart Broad: Oggy. Neil Harris makes an excellent point. I, for one, am definitely guilty of underestimating the loss of James Anderson. \u201cIn response to Barney\u2019s column (and Scott\u2019s rant) are we underestimating the impact of missing Anderson ( I don\u2019t believe it was mentioned) he is not only the most skilful bowler we\u2019ve had in decades he is also the leader of the attack who can keep the bowlers in line. He may not have had much personal success against Smith but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have ideas. I watched some highlights of the Adelaide second innings from 2017 and as soon as Smith came in Anderson went around the wicket and got him out LBW (it was overturned by the slightest of margins) \u2013 yesterday the bowlers took an age to try this. Maybe in Anderson\u2019s absence they forgot or perhaps don\u2019t feel they have the skill. I\u2019m not looking to offer an excuse but I believe us missing Jimmy has cost us victories at Edgbaston and possibly Lord\u2019s. And who knows what at Old Trafford, maybe the Ashes?\u201d Tim Paine\u2019s position in Australia\u2019s side was questioned before this fourth Test but as Geoff Lemon writes, his value lies in more than just peeling off runs at no.7. Much is made of Paine\u2019s first\u2011class record, most notably the lone century all the way back in 2006. English press colleagues have enjoyed bon mots about his last hundred coming before the invention of the iPhone. The Paine of those young years was a stylish batsman who was expected to make big runs. The later model with his rebuilt fingers does a different job: stitching together innings that are in trouble, working with the lower order, putting together some impressively brave innings since his Test recall in late 2017. Kim Thonger logs on in all kinds of weather. \u201cIn sheer desperation I\u2019ve been looking through a list of Harry Potter spells (isn\u2019t t\u2019internet marvellous?). Some or all of these ought to work on Steve Smith: Avifors: Turns things into birds; Confundus: Confounds your target, or makes them temporarily confused; Evanesco: Causes an item to immediately dissolve away, as if it had never existed; Imperio: The third unforgivable curse, allows the user to assume complete control of another person. I particularly like Locomotor Mortis: (useful combined with legspin) The Leg-Locker Curse; locks an opponent\u2019s legs together. The rest are here. The covers are still on, by the way, so don\u2019t feel you have to rush to finish whatever it is you\u2019re doing before 11am BST. I can also report it\u2019s sympathy raining at the MCG. \u201cMuch as we might pray for rain today the forecast suggests Saturday and Sunday will be mostly fine \u2013 Australia should feel confident they have plenty of time to get 20 wickets especially against this brittle England batting line up,\u201d I agree Paul Frangi. \u201cIf I was Tim Paine I\u2019d have declared on 400 yesterday and laid down the gauntlet to England.\u201d I disagree with that Paul. I think batting once was the smart play. \u201cI\u2019m still confused by the Overton selection \u2013 this is not a hard pacy wicket so who exactly has been giving pitch misinformation to the England management team? And don\u2019t the selectors still have some say over what type of pitch is prepared for a Test?\u201d The inquest into that will not reflect well on the England hierarchy should they lose at Old Trafford. While we all rack our brains to figure out how to unsettle Steve Smith, the man himself goes about quietly unstitching Englands best laid plans, as Ali Martin reports. I faced a lot of short-pitched bowling and haven\u2019t had too many issues. The opposition bowling there means they can\u2019t hit my pad or nick me off. It softens up the ball too and that plays into my hands. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Sam Hey. \u201cIt is indeed a typical Manchester day as I\u2019m sat here in a quiet moment in my GP clinic. It seems that this is almost becoming a battle of the heroes: Stokes v Smith. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any consistency anywhere else in either team and the two sides are just trying to outdo each other in terms of heroics. Is this a fair evaluation? Granted I\u2019ve only properly got into cricket this summer.\u201d Its not an unfair evaluation Sam, although we have seen a consistently high standard of bowling throughout the series too - yesterday notwithstanding. \u201cSorry about the long rant here,\u201d begins Scott Roberts (who I suspect is not really sorry at all) but I have to agree with Barney\u2019s piece in that the 90s was exactly the same comparison I made in my mind given the utter ineptitude of the bowling and fielding plans yesterday. I really don\u2019t wish to sound like a broken record, but why we have such a mental block that creates such brainless bowling at Steve Smith baffles me. Look (to paraphrase an Australian), it\u2019s unlikely, especially on a flat pitch that you\u2019re going to get Smith out using conventional methods such as bowling in the channel, as he obviously has a great eye and defence and is not going to go chasing the ball to create nicks. He uses the leg-theory law to his advantage (much like Graeme Smith, who we also bowled dreadfully at), as he knows that he can walk across his stumps and flick the ball behind square on the legside with a maximum of three fielders back there, meaning that the danger involved is minimal (yes, you could have a leg slip, but the downside of a leg slip is that they are unsighted until the ball suddenly flies at them). So what is Steve Smith\u2019s weakness? He hates not scoring. You could see it late yesterday afternoon when Craig Overton, briefly, decided to bowl wide of off stump; Smith hated it and started playing wild shots and was walking way across to the offside to try to manufacture something, suddenly becoming vulnerable. But then we suddenly decided to not do that anymore. Why? Why such lack of patience from an international team? Either bowl wide of off stump with an offside field OR bowl very straight with a strong legside field, but either way, STICK TO THE PLAN!! I would even ask Leachy to bowl very wide over the wicket in the footholes with a packed legside field. No, there\u2019s no chance of lbw, but can Smith really resist taking a huge risk and not trying to smash the ball for a boundary when his scoring rate has come to a halt?\u201d \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Peter Bellew. \u201cThe stars have finally aligned and I have managed be working from home this Friday. This means I can feign working through the day while enjoying the 3rd day of the Ashes and England vs. Italy in the evening. This does all however rely on us not giving up all 20 in the two days. Bon Chance England!\u201d Good to have you on board Peter. And an excellent distraction suggestion for when England are three-for-not-very-many in a few hours from now, just focus on the rugby. While many with a soft spot for the England cricket team might beg to differ, there\u2019s something reassuring and orderly about reading how ineptly they\u2019ve played. Barney Ronay gets into a Madchester vibe with his take on yesterday\u2019s miserableness. Squint a little and the picture began to dissolve. Baggy-jeaned ghosts shuffled at the edge of the stands. Jangly guitar music seemed to float across the Manchester skyline. And for two and a half hours between lunch and tea on the second day of this fourth Test England went back to the 90s. In Ashes terms that was the decade of sessions from hell, of howlers and shockers, of bursts of defining English ineptitude. Proper Cricket Men will say you can\u2019t win the Ashes in a session \u2013 but you can lose them. The Met Office forecast indicates rain is more likely than not up to 2pm, after which dryness should prevail for the rest of the match. It\u2019s rained overnight and this morning, and with overcast skies and showers drifting along play looks set to be intermittent at best before lunch. It remains to be seen if we\u2019ll start on time but I wouldn\u2019t bank on it. Hey everybody, let\u2019s listen to New Order. Yesterday, Vic Marks watched Steve Smith bat and bat and bat and bat, and England go through the motions. In return, he brought you this report. By Thursday afternoon Smith had delivered a double century, the third in his Test career, all of which have been against England. It may not be a match-winning innings, though there is a strong likelihood of it. It certainly ensures that Australia will not lose this contest. It was not a flawless knock. Unusually he needed some assistance from his opponents. On 65 he offered a tough return catch to Jofra Archer from a low full-toss; on 118 he was caught at slip by Ben Stokes off Jack Leach but then came the realisation that the left-armer had overstepped. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day three of the fourth Test from Old Trafford. Not for the first time this summer the day begins with players and staff craning their necks and studying the sky, wondering when play might begin and how many overs might be possible. This is a very Manchester day. The clouds are gunmetal grey and hanging patiently, like an insistent parent holding a damp flannel in the direction of a toddler\u2019s mucky face. England won\u2019t mind if time is taken out of the Test. Surely they are in no position to contemplate winning, regardless how vivid the memory remains of Ben Stokes\u2019s heroics at Headingley. After two days of sub-optimal bowling and fielding, and ten overs of predictably questionable batting, England will do well to leave Lancashire with the Ashes alive. If they don\u2019t it will be largely down to Steve Smith. Once again the Australian elevated his craft to levels not seen for 70 years. This is his series, and we are lucky to be around to witness greatness. But cricket being cricket, somehow he may still yet fly home without the urn. I\u2019m going to be around for the next hour or so to keep Adam Collins\u2019s seat warm. If you would like to keep me company during this time please feel free to drop me a line on Twitter or by email.",

      "bodyText": "Robert Mugabe, the deeply divisive former president of Zimbabwe, was declared a \u201cnational hero\u201d by the ruling Zanu-PF party on Friday, as preparations for his funeral got under way in the nation he ruled with an iron first for almost 40 years. The death of the former president on Thursday night in a clinic in Singapore marks the definitive end of an era in the former British colony. Mugabe, who died aged 95, ruled Zimbabwe for close to four decades before being ousted in a military takeover in November 2017. Though initially admired as a hero of Africa\u2019s independence struggle, his long rule descended into tyranny, corruption and incompetence, earning him international pariah status. His death prompted mixed reactions in Zimbabwe, across Africa and around the world. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power after Mugabe\u2019s fall, called his predecessor \u201can icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people\u201d and said Zimbabwe would be in official mourning until the former leader\u2019s remains were brought back from Singapore and buried. Tendai Biti, a prominent opposition politician, said that though he had been tortured on Mugabe\u2019s orders, he was not bitter. \u201cHe brought massive destruction to Zimbabwe but was a product of his era. He did not know how to make the transformation from liberation leader to national leader,\u201d Biti told the Guardian. No plans for a funeral have been announced, but it is expected to take place in the capital, Harare, or Mugabe\u2019s home town of Zvimba. The ruling African National Congress party in neighbouring South Africa described Mugabe as a \u201cfriend, statesman and revolutionary comrade\u201d. In a statement, the ANC acknowledged that it had sometimes \u201cdiffered vociferously\u201d with him, but remembered \u201can ardent and vocal advocate of African unity and self-reliance\u201d whose struggle had been an inspiration. Flags in Kenya were flown at half mast. But in the UK, Downing Street said that while \u201cwe of course express our condolences to those who mourn\u201d the former leader represented \u201ca barrier to a better future\u201d. \u201cUnder his rule the people of Zimbabwe suffered greatly as he impoverished their country and sanctioned the use of violence against them,\u201d a spokesman for prime minister Boris Johnson said. Mugabe had made frequent visits to Singapore to receive medical care in recent months as his health deteriorated. As far back as November 2018, Mnangagwa told members of the ruling Zanu-PF party that Mugabe could no longer walk. Once widely celebrated for his role in fighting the white supremacist regime in his homeland, Mugabe had long become a deeply divisive figure in his own country and across the continent. His final years in power were characterised by financial collapse, surges of violent intimidation and a vicious internal power struggle pitting his second wife Grace, 41 years younger than him, against Mnangagwa, his former right-hand man. The rivalry was resolved when Mnangagwa, a Zanu-PF stalwart, took power when Mugabe reluctantly resigned after a military takeover. The news of his decision prompted widespread rejoicing. On Friday Mnangagwa thanked \u201cformer first lady Grace Mugabe for standing by her husband until the end\u201d. Grace Mugabe became known for her lavish lifestyle and joined the Zanu-PF politburo by virtue of her leadership of the party\u2019s influential Women\u2019s League in 2014. She became a political liability for the ageing autocrat, however, and her outspoken criticism of Mnangagwa was one of the triggers for the military takeover that ousted her husband. But Mugabe remained devoted to his wife, calling her \u201cmy Grace\u201d in his last press conference and demanding better treatment for his spouse from Zimbabwe\u2019s new rulers. After his fall, Mugabe was granted the status of a respected father of the nation and a generous pension by the new government. The move angered his many opponents and upset many victims of his regime. But Mugabe\u2019s own frustration and humiliation over his ousting were clear, and voiced with typical rhetorical force at an extraordinary press conference in the grounds of his residence in Harare days before elections in July 2018. Mugabe, flanked by his wife, suggested he would vote for the opposition MDC, a party he had brutally suppressed before co-opting it in 2008 to form a supposed unity government that he still dominated. Educated at Catholic missionary schools, Mugabe became a teacher in Ghana then returned to Rhodesia in 1960 to fight white minority rule. Eventually freedom was won and Mugabe promised to embrace the country\u2019s white population. He led the country through a golden period of economic growth and educational development that was the envy of Africa. The international community turned a blind eye, however, to human rights abuses, most notably the 1980s ethnic cleansing of at least 20,000 people in Matabeleland province. Opposition rose again in 1999 as the economy floundered and trade unions organised around the Movement for Democratic Change. Mugabe rigged elections and began a programme of land reform in which white farmers were forcibly evicted to make way for Zanu-PF party cronies or black Zimbabweans who lacked the skills and capital to farm.

That isn\u2019t a reason to ignore it. In fact it needs meeting head-on, for it marks a further irruption into mainstream politics across the rich world of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/great-replacement-theory-alt-right-killers-el-paso\" title=\"\">replacement theory</a>\u201d: the belief that the nature of Europe is threatened by demographic change. This fear has become central to politics in the United States and Australia, as well as many European countries, whether or not they have large immigrant populations themselves. It was one of the drivers of the result of the Brexit referendum, in which hostility towards European immigrants served as a cover for wider xenophobias.</p> <p>The presence at the Budapest summit of the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, and his praise of Mr Orb\u00e1n, underlies the global nature of this belief. At <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/transcript-tony-abbotts-controversial-speech-at-the-margaret-thatcher-lecture-20151028-gkkg6p.html\" title=\"\">a speech in honour of Margaret Thatcher</a> in 2015, Mr Abbott, one of the architects of Australia\u2019s brutal refugee policy, argued that European countries should embark on a massive programme of imprisoning would-be migrants overseas, and repelling them at land borders and at sea: \u201cIt will require some force; it will require massive logistics and expense; it will gnaw at our consciences \u2013 yet it is the only way to prevent a tide of humanity surging through Europe and quite possibly changing it for ever.\u201d</p> <p>The prediction relies in part on undeniable demographic reality: the population of parts of the developed world is shrinking, while that of the poor world is growing. This is happening just as the climate emergency makes the most populous parts of the world less habitable. With the best will in the world, these changes will lead to strains and tensions. And the best will \u2013 even goodwill \u2013 is in short supply in the world at the moment.</p> <p>In the past, the left has responded to the anti-migration rhetoric of the right with economic answers. These are important but not sufficient, as the rise of anti-immigrant populists has shown.

      "bodyText": "The speech on Thursday by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, praising the fertility of Hungarian women as a bulwark of Europe\u2019s survival appealed to dangerous and atavistic myths. That isn\u2019t a reason to ignore it. In fact it needs meeting head-on, for it marks a further irruption into mainstream politics across the rich world of \u201creplacement theory\u201d: the belief that the nature of Europe is threatened by demographic change. This fear has become central to politics in the United States and Australia, as well as many European countries, whether or not they have large immigrant populations themselves. It was one of the drivers of the result of the Brexit referendum, in which hostility towards European immigrants served as a cover for wider xenophobias. The presence at the Budapest summit of the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, and his praise of Mr Orb\u00e1n, underlies the global nature of this belief. At a speech in honour of Margaret Thatcher in 2015, Mr Abbott, one of the architects of Australia\u2019s brutal refugee policy, argued that European countries should embark on a massive programme of imprisoning would-be migrants overseas, and repelling them at land borders and at sea: \u201cIt will require some force; it will require massive logistics and expense; it will gnaw at our consciences \u2013 yet it is the only way to prevent a tide of humanity surging through Europe and quite possibly changing it for ever.\u201d The prediction relies in part on undeniable demographic reality: the population of parts of the developed world is shrinking, while that of the poor world is growing. This is happening just as the climate emergency makes the most populous parts of the world less habitable. With the best will in the world, these changes will lead to strains and tensions. And the best will \u2013 even goodwill \u2013 is in short supply in the world at the moment. In the past, the left has responded to the anti-migration rhetoric of the right with economic answers. These are important but not sufficient, as the rise of anti-immigrant populists has shown. Even if it\u2019s true that people can be swapped out as economic units without regard to their origins, that is not something the people who feel themselves swapped out will happily accept. The left traditionally, and rightly, believes that people are far more than the sum of their economic usefulness to others \u2013 that they have rights, and an intrinsic value just because they are human. This is the belief, and the moral compulsion, that leads us to treat refugees as fellow humans. What is new about the Orb\u00e1n government\u2019s recent approach to this problem is that it proposes that as well as excluding refugees, Hungarian women should do their patriotic part by raising more babies. This has already led to a diplomatic row with Sweden, whose minister for social security, Annika Strandh\u00e4ll, said in February that it stank of Europe\u2019s 1930s \u2013 a time when politicians in many countries (including Sweden) urged women to have larger families as part of the nationalist competition which ended so catastrophically in 1939. Any attempt to discuss demographics now must start with the importance of reproductive rights and women\u2019s choices. It can\u2019t stop there, though. So long as child-rearing is understood as primarily work for women, attempts to encourage large families will inevitably be seen as attempts to chase women out of the workforce. For men to take a greater share of their responsibilities around the home is an essential step towards a fairer and more sustainable world. The issues will not go away, though, and they cannot be ignored for the global right to exploit. In their hands they will become a further encouragement to far-right terrorism. But in an age of environmental breakdown, we cannot close our eyes and ears to the realities of population growth and shifts. Very hard questions will arise about the division of resources on a planet that cannot even afford the consumption patterns of the rich world today, to which the poor world justifiably aspires.

He told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear that if you want to stop Brexit with no fudge or ambiguity, residents in this area are already picking the Liberal Democrats.\u201d</p> <p>Umunna is officially moving because the Lib Dems already have a well-established candidate in Streatham. It has, however, been a safe Labour seat for over 20 years, with the party winning <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000978\">almost 70% of the vote in 2017</a>, making it hugely difficult for Umunna to win as a Lib Dem.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sad and difficult decision, but I know that the constituency will be in very good hands,\u201d he said of the decision. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve got to take seats from the Labour party, but also, we\u2019ve vitally got to take seats from Boris Johnson\u2019s Vote Leave government.\u201d</p> <p>The mooted move to shift Berger to Finchley and Golders Green remains to be confirmed. While narrowly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000703\">held by the Conservatives</a> over Labour, it is a strongly Jewish area and there are indications some Jewish voters could abandon Labour over its handling of antisemitism in the party.</p> <p>Berger, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/luciana-berger-joins-liberal-democrats-brexit-remain\">announced as a Lib Dem on Thursday</a>, quit Labour in February over the issue.</p> <p>The existing Lib Dem candidate for Finchley and Golders Green, Clareine Enderby, said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d Berger had joined, but said she was still the candidate: \u201cI look forward to making sure that Finchley and Golders Green is Liberal Democrat at the next election.\u201d</p> <p>A party spokeswoman said: \u201cLuciana Berger only joined a day ago, and no decisions will have been made, so this is all speculation.\u201d</p>",

The proposed move for Berger, who currently represents Liverpool Wavertree, has upset some local Lib Dems, with the existing candidate saying on Friday she still expected to fight it. One Lib Dem activist said: \u201cPeople are fed up with celebrity MP entryism. Hardworking candidates are being yanked out of their seats or pressured not to stand.\u201d The Lib Dems have gained five new MPs in recent weeks, one via a byelection but the rest refugees from Labour \u2013 Umunna and Berger \u2013 and the Conservatives, in Sarah Wollaston and Phillip Lee. Umunna, who quit Labour in February and joined the Lib Dems three months later, will move from his current Streatham seat to take on Mark Field, the former Foreign Office minister who escaped punishment after being filmed grabbing a climate protester by the neck. In the 2017 election Field secured a 3,000-plus majority over Labour, with the Lib Dems a distant third. But the party believes a better indicator is May\u2019s European elections, where in both parts of the constituency the Lib Dems won more votes than the Conservatives and Labour combined. The constituency, which includes parliament, the West End and the financial centre of the City, was heavily pro-remain in the 2016 referendum. He told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear that if you want to stop Brexit with no fudge or ambiguity, residents in this area are already picking the Liberal Democrats.\u201d Umunna is officially moving because the Lib Dems already have a well-established candidate in Streatham. It has, however, been a safe Labour seat for over 20 years, with the party winning almost 70% of the vote in 2017, making it hugely difficult for Umunna to win as a Lib Dem. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad and difficult decision, but I know that the constituency will be in very good hands,\u201d he said of the decision. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve got to take seats from the Labour party, but also, we\u2019ve vitally got to take seats from Boris Johnson\u2019s Vote Leave government.\u201d The mooted move to shift Berger to Finchley and Golders Green remains to be confirmed. While narrowly held by the Conservatives over Labour, it is a strongly Jewish area and there are indications some Jewish voters could abandon Labour over its handling of antisemitism in the party. Berger, who was announced as a Lib Dem on Thursday, quit Labour in February over the issue. The existing Lib Dem candidate for Finchley and Golders Green, Clareine Enderby, said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d Berger had joined, but said she was still the candidate: \u201cI look forward to making sure that Finchley and Golders Green is Liberal Democrat at the next election.\u201d A party spokeswoman said: \u201cLuciana Berger only joined a day ago, and no decisions will have been made, so this is all speculation.\u201d",

During the event\u2019s most escapist moments, anyone longing for a dose of reality would have had more luck finding it in the virtual world.</p> \n<p>Venice VR is a pioneering festival sidebar dedicated to showcasing the best examples of an emergent art form, with a programme of 40 VR works from around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/08/virtual-reality-vr-cinema-venice-flim-festival-humpty-dumpty\">Now in its third year</a>, the section already appears to have turned more mature and serious in its focus. \u201cNew art forms usually gravitate towards dystopian fantasy and escapism,\u201d says Liz Rosenthal, Venice VR\u2019s co-curator. \u201cBut we\u2019re now seeing projects that are more interested in human relationships and social issues. It\u2019s all got a lot more sophisticated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Venice VR takes place on Lazzaretto Vecchio, a deserted island off the Venice Lido that has been repurposed as an exhibition space. The exhibits run the gamut from experimental shorts viewed on an Oculus headset, through to Kiira Benzing\u2019s exuberant Loveseat, an hour-long piece of interactive theatre involving live spectators and an online audience. But it also finds room for hard-hitting social commentary, such as Joel Benson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2019/venice-virtual-reality/daughters-chibok\">Daughters of Chibok</a>, examining the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/nigeria-boko-haram-mass-kidnapping-vital-questions\">2014 Boko Haram kidnappings</a>.

But those with a film background are perhaps putting the user in a more voyeuristic, journalistic position. It\u2019s more about looking and listening. Putting the viewer in the space of the story and letting them ask their own questions of the material.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mapplebeck was diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/breast-cancer\">breast cancer</a> in 2017. Her VR project, <a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2019/venice-virtual-reality/waiting-room-vr\">The Waiting Room</a>, is a powerful 360-degree record of her final session of radiotherapy, interspersed with conversations with her family and some near-abstract images of her cancer cells under a microscope. It follows on from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/28/the-waiting-room-single-parents-unflinching-account-living-with-cancer-video\">her 30-minute short film of the same name</a>, which was commissioned by the Guardian.

      "bodyText": "The 76th Venice film festival has included sci-fi thrills and comic-book action, backstage melodrama and medieval court intrigue. During the event\u2019s most escapist moments, anyone longing for a dose of reality would have had more luck finding it in the virtual world. Venice VR is a pioneering festival sidebar dedicated to showcasing the best examples of an emergent art form, with a programme of 40 VR works from around the world. Now in its third year, the section already appears to have turned more mature and serious in its focus. \u201cNew art forms usually gravitate towards dystopian fantasy and escapism,\u201d says Liz Rosenthal, Venice VR\u2019s co-curator. \u201cBut we\u2019re now seeing projects that are more interested in human relationships and social issues. It\u2019s all got a lot more sophisticated.\u201d Venice VR takes place on Lazzaretto Vecchio, a deserted island off the Venice Lido that has been repurposed as an exhibition space. The exhibits run the gamut from experimental shorts viewed on an Oculus headset, through to Kiira Benzing\u2019s exuberant Loveseat, an hour-long piece of interactive theatre involving live spectators and an online audience. But it also finds room for hard-hitting social commentary, such as Joel Benson\u2019s Daughters of Chibok, examining the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s 2014 Boko Haram kidnappings. Callum Cooper and Don Webb\u2019s Porton Down explores Webb\u2019s experience of being an unwitting guinea pig in a secret cold war experiment back in 1954. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the people who come to VR through the art of gaming and those who do so with a background in film,\u201d says the British documentary-maker Victoria Mapplebeck. \u201cThose who come from gaming tend to give us flights of fancy and the embodied experience of being in a genre of entertainment. But those with a film background are perhaps putting the user in a more voyeuristic, journalistic position. It\u2019s more about looking and listening. Putting the viewer in the space of the story and letting them ask their own questions of the material.\u201d Mapplebeck was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017. Her VR project, The Waiting Room, is a powerful 360-degree record of her final session of radiotherapy, interspersed with conversations with her family and some near-abstract images of her cancer cells under a microscope. It follows on from her 30-minute short film of the same name, which was commissioned by the Guardian. Mapplebeck hopes her films will challenge what she sees as reductive cultural myths about cancer \u2013 the notion that it\u2019s either an alien curse or a welcome opportunity for personal growth. She hopes to use it in outreach campaigns across UK hospitals. \u201cMy oncologist, a bit aghast, asked me, \u2018Would you have wanted to see something like this when you were starting your treatment?\u2019 she recalls. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Actually yes, I think I would.\u201d One of the grandest exhibits on VR Island is Celine Tricart\u2019s The Key, in which an actor leads visitors through a lush digital world full of colour-coded sprites and storybook monsters. But what initially plays as pure fantasy eventually reveals itself to be a first-hand account of displaced refugees. \u201cThe Key is a story about the migrant crisis, but it\u2019s not the sort of film you\u2019d get from an NGO,\u201d Rosenthal explains. \u201cIt puts you in the emotional state of the narrator and mixes the physical world with the virtual world.\u201d Rosenthal feels that technological advances have now pushed VR towards an artistic breakthrough. \u201cWhat\u2019s always been really difficult is marrying interactivity with narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we are now starting to see examples of voice-activated work in which what the user says and how they say it - even how they move - can impact the drama seamlessly and influence the whole direction of the story.

      "bodyText": "Your report on electric bin lorries powered by energy from household waste (5 September) that are being trialled by Sheffield and Westminster councils suggests that this may be a world first for local authorities. This may well be the case in the 21st century, but Sheffield also claimed to be the first to do this back in 1915. Electric refuse collection vehicles were not uncommon in the early decades of the 20th century, and one manufacturer claimed to have 50 local authority customers for its vehicles. In the mid-1920s, 7% of London refuse vehicles were electric, when ones with petrol engines made up only 11% of the total (80% were still horse-drawn). Modern energy-from-waste plants now provide electricity generated from household refuse, but this approach had also been pioneered more than a century ago with the so-called \u201cdust destructors\u201d that were installed in a number of London boroughs, as well as many provincial authorities. Recycling isn\u2019t new either \u2013 there\u2019s nothing new in the world of rubbish. Dr Peter Hounsell Greenford, London \u2022 In the early 20th century a number of British councils burned rubbish to generate electricity, in facilities quaintly called \u201crefuse destructors\u201d. Some of the electricity produced went to power council-owned trams and some was typically used to charge up the fleets of electric dustcarts that fed the destructors. In some places the practice continued after the second world war: Birmingham ran a considerable fleet of electric dustcarts into the 1950s. At least one of these survives in the collections of Birmingham museum. I wonder what other forgotten technologies could also help with the climate emergency?

The bill is thought to be legally watertight, and it seems to have closed off the option of Johnson forcing a no-deal Brexit at the end of October - a threat he claims has to be on the table if the EU is to offer him the compromise he insists he can obtain. Johnson has said that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than demand an article 50 extension and no one seems to know (including perhaps Johnson himself?) what will happen if he gets to 19 October - the Saturday after the October EU summit, and the deadline in the bill for sending a letter requesting a Brexit deal - and the law says he must request an extension. Johnson can only avoid this condition either by getting MPs to pass a withdrawal agreement, or by getting them to vote to agree to a no-deal Brexit. The latter will never happen, and the former (on the basis of what we know say far about the UK-EU renegotiation) seems a remote possibility. The bill means MPs will have recourse to the courts if Johnson were to refuse to request an extension, but quite how this might play out in practice is not clear.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/opposition-parties-agree-block-snap-election-until-brexit-delay-secured\">Opposition parties have agreed to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to trigger a snap election for a second time on Monday, making it increasingly unlikely a poll will be held before 31 October.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-will-use-powers-persuasion-win-new-brexit-deal\">Boris Johnson has said he will win a new Brexit deal at next month\u2019s EU summit by using his \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d, and rejected calls for a further extension to article 50.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/criticism-grows-boris-johnson-use-police-officers-political-speech\">West Yorkshire police have criticised Boris Johnson for making a political speech before a backdrop of its officers, with the chief constable saying the force was assured this would not happen but that Downing Street changed plans at the last minute.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-prorogation-of-parliament-is-lawful-high-court-rules\">The legal campaigner Gina Miller has vowed to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court in London ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was legal.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/gauke-johnson-risks-millions-of-votes-with-farage-lite-strategy\">Boris Johnson\u2019s divisive strategy risks turning the Conservatives into a \u201cFarage-lite\u201d party that will alienate millions of traditional Tory voters, the former justice secretary David Gauke has warned.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>James Cleverly, the Conservative party chair, has been branded \u201cchildish\u201d by one of his predecessors, Sayeeda Warsi, after he promoted a Tory advert branding Jeremy Corbyn a chicken for not agreeing to an early election.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SayeedaWarsi/status/1169966320743538689\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This James is silly playground behaviour.<br>We are in the middle of a national crisis and this is our response.\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f<br>How can grown men reduce themselves to this level of silliness.

Blackford said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament so the idea that he is coming with a motion to try and force an election, having lost one this week, is insane. He is not going to compel parliamentarians to give him a mandate to determine the timing \u2013 we don\u2019t trust him. </p> \n   <p>We\u2019ll determine the timing of this, not Boris Johnson.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Like Emily Thornberry (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/06/brexit-boris-johnson-news-latest-eu-labour-confirms-it-will-not-vote-on-monday-night-for-early-election-live-newsbior?page=with:block-5d7209428f082514879eeeed#block-5d7209428f082514879eeeed\">9.01am</a>), Blackford stressed the importance of ensuring the UK would not crash out of the EU on 31 October before allowing an election to take place. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want [the election] to happen as soon as is practically possible, but I want us to secure the safety of not crashing out. It\u2019s balancing these things.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked when it would be a good time to hold an election, he dodged the question. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As soon as is practically possible ... It\u2019s going to happen over the course of the next few weeks. We will choose the timing of that because Boris Johnson has lost his majority in parliament. The opposition parties are now effectively in control. Boris Johnson is not going to bounce us into a situation of his choosing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One option for the opposition parties would be to use a no confidence motion to try to bring down Johnson\u2019s government. Blackford said he would like such a vote to go ahead but if it happened this week and was successful, the fact that parliament is being prorogued could stop the opposition parties being able to use the 14 days available under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to form a new government. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would like us to have a motion of no confidence as soon as is practically possible. The problem we\u2019ve got is that we are going into prorogation next week. Even if we had a vote of no confidence, there is then a 14-day period when a government has to be put in place.

Asked if there would be a \u201cno\u201d from Labour on Monday, she replied: \u201cYes.\u201d She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The problem that we have is that the motion that the government has put before, and it looks like will put again, is a motion under the Fixed-term Parliament Act under clauses 2 (7) and 3 of the Fixed-term Parliament Act, if we vote to have a general election, then no matter what it is that Boris Johnson promises, it is up to him to advise the Queen when the general election should be. And given that he has shown himself to be a manifest liar, and someone who has said that he will die in a ditch rather than stop no deal, and indeed his adviser, [Dominic] Cummings, has been swearing and shouting at MPs saying they are leaving on 31 [October] no matter what, our first priority has to be that we must stop no deal and we must make sure that that is going to happen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Labour there are different views on exactly when an early election should take place, and there is as yet no settled view. Yesterday John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, hinted that his preference was to \u201cgo long\u201d. Asked if she thought Labour should wait until after the EU summit in mid October, and until after an article 50 extension has been agreed, Thornberry replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not going to go into details. But my instinct on this is the same as John\u2019s.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s position is crucial because, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a vote for an early election only gets implemented if two thirds of MPs in the House of Commons (434) vote for it.

      "bodyText": "A bill designed to stop Boris Johnson taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October without a Brexit agreement has cleared the House of Lords, and it is set to become law on Monday when it is due to get royal assent. The bill, drafted over the summer by a cross-party alliance of MPs and tabled by Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, got through all its stages in the Lords in two days, without any amendments being passed. The bill is thought to be legally watertight, and it seems to have closed off the option of Johnson forcing a no-deal Brexit at the end of October - a threat he claims has to be on the table if the EU is to offer him the compromise he insists he can obtain. Johnson has said that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than demand an article 50 extension and no one seems to know (including perhaps Johnson himself?) what will happen if he gets to 19 October - the Saturday after the October EU summit, and the deadline in the bill for sending a letter requesting a Brexit deal - and the law says he must request an extension. Johnson can only avoid this condition either by getting MPs to pass a withdrawal agreement, or by getting them to vote to agree to a no-deal Brexit. The latter will never happen, and the former (on the basis of what we know say far about the UK-EU renegotiation) seems a remote possibility. The bill means MPs will have recourse to the courts if Johnson were to refuse to request an extension, but quite how this might play out in practice is not clear. Opposition parties have agreed to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to trigger a snap election for a second time on Monday, making it increasingly unlikely a poll will be held before 31 October. Boris Johnson has said he will win a new Brexit deal at next month\u2019s EU summit by using his \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d, and rejected calls for a further extension to article 50. West Yorkshire police have criticised Boris Johnson for making a political speech before a backdrop of its officers, with the chief constable saying the force was assured this would not happen but that Downing Street changed plans at the last minute. The legal campaigner Gina Miller has vowed to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court in London ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was legal. Boris Johnson\u2019s divisive strategy risks turning the Conservatives into a \u201cFarage-lite\u201d party that will alienate millions of traditional Tory voters, the former justice secretary David Gauke has warned. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chair, has been branded \u201cchildish\u201d by one of his predecessors, Sayeeda Warsi, after he promoted a Tory advert branding Jeremy Corbyn a chicken for not agreeing to an early election. Boris Johnson called David Cameron a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in unredacted government papers obtained by Sky News. In a note about proroguing parliament, Johnson said: \u201cThe whole September session is a rigmarole introduced by girly swot Cameron and show the public that MPs are earning their crust.\u201d Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern says Johnson\u2019s language says something about his attitude to women. Bankers bonuses could be banned in Britain in order to tackle high levels of inequality across the country, John McDonnell has said. The government is to review the provision and funding of special needs education for children in England, after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that many families faced struggles as a result of the government\u2019s reforms. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Naomi Smith, chief executive of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, commenting on the Benn bill passing the Lords. The Lords have guided Britain further away from the no-deal cliff edge towards which the PM has been stumbling blindly. Parliament has forced Boris Johnson into a corner and his reckless Brexit strategy is in tatters. He must now uphold democratic process and formally seek this extension or face the courts. If you want to read the Hansard with today\u2019s House of Lords debate on the Benn bill, it\u2019s here. Here is a House of Lords library note (pdf) explaining what the Benn bill actually does. And there is a shorter summary here. And this is from the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, Dick Newby. Despite cynical attempts from Tory backbenchers to filibuster, the article 50 extension bill has seen safe passage through the House of Lords. It seems that - unlike our suitcases - their threats of disruption were empty. Liberal Democrats in both the Lords and the Commons have fought tirelessly against the attempts by the prime minister to force a disastrous no-deal Brexit, and this bill is an important step towards trying to sort out the mess the government has made. This is from the Labour peers\u2019 Twitter account. The Benn bill, intended to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has just been approved by the House of Lords. It passed the upper house without being amended, which means that it does not have to go back to the House of Commons. It will become law as soon as it gets royal assent, which should happen on Monday. There were two votes earlier today, on Brexiter amendments intended to sabotage the bill, but they were easily defeated \u2013 by 268 votes to 47, and by 283 votes to 28. Earlier in the week a group of Tory Brexiter peers tried to filibuster a motion designed to allow the bill to clear the Lords by the end of today. But they backed down after dragging out a debate past 1am on Wednesday night/Thursday morning after the opposition parties agreed not to use guillotine motions. Some polling quoted in a Financial Times story (paywall) by Jim Pickard helps to explain why Labour might be keen to delay the election until November. If Johnson were to go to the polls after 31 October without having delivered Brexit, support for the Brexit party would double, the poll suggests. Pickard writes: An ICM poll suggests that support for the Brexit party would double from 9 per cent to 18 per cent if an election takes place after Halloween. The poll, commissioned by Represent Us \u2014 which is pushing for a second Brexit referendum \u2014 found the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour would evaporate in those circumstances. The ICM poll suggests the Tories would beat Labour by 37 per cent against 30 per cent in an October election, while the two parties would be neck and neck on 28 per cent in a November poll. We have already quoted extensively from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters at the farm in Aberdeen, but here are three more lines from him. They are from his interview with Sky News. Johnson claimed it would be possible to do a trade deal with the US that would cover beef without allowing American hormone-treated meat in to the UK. Talking about the opportunities available to the UK after Brexit, he said: Look at fantastic Scottish beef, which I\u2019ve just been looking at. Not a morsel of it currently goes to America. You could do a a free trade deal with America where you don\u2019t import their hormone-treated beef, but you do a deal on high-quality products, you allow Scottish farmers to sell, to discover new markets around the world. He claimed Jeremy Corbyn was making a mistake in refusing to back an early election. He said: I think it is the most sensational paradox. Never in history has there been an opposition party that has been given the chance to have an election and has turned it down. If I may say so, I think that they are making an extraordinary political mistake. But it\u2019s their decision. (Why Johnson would want an early election if it was also advantageous to Labour to have one was not explained.) He said the government was set to unveil a \u201cgolden age of infrastructure investment\u201d. He said: When global interest rates are so low, this is is the moment to have golden age of infrastructure investment. That\u2019s what Sajid Javid set out in the spending review this week and in the budget this autumn you will be hearing a lot more about infrastructure, about improving our roads, our railways, doing fantastic things with full-fibre broadband across the whole country. Boris Johnson has said he will win a new Brexit deal at next month\u2019s EU summit by using his \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d, and rejected calls for a further extension to article 50. The prime minister said he had no plans to accept the new legislation which would require him to write to the EU asking for a \u201cpointless\u201d delay to Brexit, during a visit to Aberdeenshire on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a long time trying to sort of fudge this thing and I think the British public really want us to get out. They don\u2019t want more dither and delay,\u201d he said after encountering a prize bull called Keene at a beef farm near Banchory. Asked how he would deliver a new deal at the EU summit on 17 October, he said: By powers of persuasion. Because there\u2019s absolutely no doubt we should come out \u2026 It\u2019s a pointless delay. Scotland\u2019s highest civil court will not give its judgement before Wednesday on a challenge to the planned prorogation of parliament, the Press Association reports. The lord president, Lord Carloway, rejected an application to make an interim order to halt the process, despite hearing from the applicants that prorogation could be started two days before that, on Monday. He said the court had some extremely complex issues to decide, which would take some time, and it hoped to be in a position to give its judgement on Wednesday. Here is the ITV political editor Robert Peston\u2019s take on the election timing story. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about what the opposition leaders at Westminster decided about an early election when they spoke this morning. And this is how it starts. Opposition parties have agreed to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to trigger a snap election for a second time on Monday, making it increasingly unlikely a poll will be held before 31 October. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, told the World at One that he believes the opposition parties have agreed not to support an early election until November. Labour did not explicitly say that in its readout of the meeting (see 12.52pm), but Brake was explicit. He said: We [the opposition parties] are not going to give the prime minister the election he is so desperate for until an extension has been secured and the risk of crashing out of the EU without a deal is completely eliminated. He said by \u2018extension being secured\u2019, he did not just mean the Hilary Benn bill, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, becoming law. He meant Boris Johnson going to Brussels and securing that extension. And if [Johnson] chooses to disobey the law, and not follow what parliament has required him to do, then we have agreed that we will take all necessary action to enforce that. Asked if that meant there would be no election before 31 October, Brake said: Any election before 31 October runs the risk of us crashing out of the European Union and that would be completely irresponsible ... The opposition parties are very keen to have a general election. We just want it to be on 1 November or later than that. I\u2019m not quite sure why delay of a couple of weeks is so important to the prime minister. He\u2019s desperate for an election and presumably would be keen to have one after 31 October. Another Conservative MP from the mainstream, one nation, remain-voting wing of the party has announced that she is standing down. Claire Perry, 55, was energy minister, with the right to attend cabinet, until she left the government when Boris Johnson became prime minister. I say \u201cmainstream\u201d, but that adjective is probably misleading. MPs like Perry, Caroline Spelman, Nick Hurd, Alistair Burt and Nicholas Soames used to represent mainstream Conservatism. But the centre of gravity of the party has shifted dramatically since 2016, a process that has accelerated under Johnson\u2019s leadership, and now hardline Brexiter is the mainstream. Johnson would argue that it is possible to combine one nation Conservatism in relation to a domestic agenda with a firm commitment to Brexit, but the recent personnel changes in his party make that claim questionable. The Evening Standard has a useful list of all the MPs who have said they are standing down at the election. There were further hints that Boris Johnson seems fatigued and drained by the crisis bedevilling his government, after his brother Jo\u2019s resignation and the angry criticism of party grandees in the last 24 hours. The prime offered a curiously-phrased answer to a question about his own future during a 12-minute long press conference with newspaper reporters in Aberdeenshire, lacking his normally self-confident bounce and bluster. He was asked by the Guardian when he might resign, given he had won the Tory leadership with a pledge to unite the party and the country, yet had presided over deep splits in both. He answered: What I said was that we had to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. He was asked again: at what point do you think you might resign? Er \u2026 Well \u2026 I think after those three objectives have been accomplished I will \u2026 At some point after those three objectives have been accomplished. He had been up since before dawn, visiting Peterhead fish market soon after 6am after travelling to and from West Yorkshire yesterday. Prime ministers normally insist they have no intention of standing down, swatting aside any doubts about their future. He could claim to be tired. Labour has issued a statement about talks Jeremy Cobyn held this morning with other opposition party leaders about stopping a no-deal Brexit and about the timing of an election. The SNP and Plaid Cyrmu have both been implying there was an agreement not to hold an early election until November (see 12.07pm and 12.24pm), but the Labour statement does not go that far. A spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn hosted a positive conference call with other opposition party leaders this morning. They discussed advancing efforts to prevent a damaging no deal brexit and hold a general election once that is secured. Boris Johnson gave a far less bullish response to questions about the Brexit crisis during a visit to a beef farm in Aberdeenshire on Friday morning, seeming more hesitant about seeking a delay to Brexit and the fate of his controversial adviser Dominic Cummings. After a dawn visit to Peterhead\u2019s fish market several hours earlier, Johnson seemed tired, making several attempts to answer questions and dropping the \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d rhetoric he used on Thursday. Asked to confirm that he would refuse to seek an extension to article 50 even if legally required to by the opposition bill now going through the Lords, he gave an ambiguous response in which he refused to explicitly confirm he would ignore the legislation. He cut short a sentence in which he appeared to be about to say he would not request an extension. He said: \u201cI will not ex \u2026 I don\u2019t want a delay.\u201d Pressed on a challenge by Sir John Major on Thursday night to sack Cummings, Johnson first failed to answer a direct question from one reporter, then refused to give his chief adviser explicit support when asked a second time. He answered: I \u2026 I \u2026 Look \u2026 Advisers, as I think someone said in the Commons the other day, advisers advise and ministers decide. On Thursday evening, Major made an implicit reference to Cummings in a speech to the CBI Scotland annual dinner: We have seen over-mighty advisers before. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly. I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly. There is no need for them to be led out of Downing Street by armed police, but go they should. And now. Boris Johnson has been speaking to reporters in Scotland. My colleague Severin Carrell was there, and we will be covering everything he said shortly. Johnson told reporters that he would get a Brexit deal. But, as Severin points out, he also said at another point that part of him still \u201cyearns\u201d to believe that the Loch Ness monster exists \u2013 suggesting he has a weakness for believing in the impossible. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, has just confirmed that in their conversation this morning the opposition party leaders agreed that guaranteeing an article 50 extension should take priority over calling an early election. (See 12.07pm.) She told BBC News: We need to make sure we get past the 31 October and an extension to article 50. In that respect, we were in agreement that the prime minister is on the run. Boris is broken. We have an opportunity to bring down Boris, to break Boris, and to bring down Brexit. And we must take that. Just as this week, the vote for a general election would play into Boris Johnson\u2019s hands. It would allow him to ignore the legislation that is currently going through the House of Lords, likely to have royal assent today. It would allow him to ignore that. It would give him the opportunity to ignore the law. Our duty, therefore, as parliamentarians who are intent on stopping no-deal Brexit is to be here in this place, to hold him to account, and to make sure that he abides by the law. This suggests the opposition parties want parliament to be sitting around the time of 19 October, which is when Johnson would have to write to the EU requesting a Brexit extension if by then there was niether a deal nor a vote in parliament to approve a no-deal Brexit. That would mean an election would not take place until November at the earliest. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates From the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne The chief constable of West Yorkshire police, John Robins, has said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to see his officers used as a backdrop to a party political event staged by Boris Johnson yesterday, something that had not been agreed in advance. In a statement, Robins said: I am pleased that we were chosen as the focal point of the national recruitment campaign launch, but the good news of extra officers was overshadowed by the media coverage of other events. It was the understanding of West Yorkshire police that any involvement of our officers was solely about police officer recruitment. We had no prior knowledge that the speech would be broadened to other issues until it was delivered. Minutes before the speech, we were told that [a planned visit to the National Police Air Service] and subsequent brief to a small media pool had been cancelled. I was therefore disappointed to see my police officers as a backdrop to the part of the speech that was not related to recruitment. After the disastrous speech, Johnson gave his own explanation to the Yorkshire Post about what happened. These are from the Yorkshire Post\u2019s Rob Parsons. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who joined the Lib Dems this year, has announced that he plans to stand for his new party in The Cities of London &amp; Westminster at the next election, Joe Murphy reveals in the Evening Standard. As Murphy writes, this is \u201ca flagship [Conservative] seat that covers the City, Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street\u201d. The current MP, Mark Field, had a majority of 3,148 over Labour at the 2017 election. The Lib Dems were a poor third in that election, but in this year\u2019s European election they came top in the constituency. Umunna says he cannot stand again in his current constituency, Streatham, because the Lib Dems already have a candidate there. Standing for Labour in Streatham two years ago, Umunna had a majority of 26,285. There were three local council byelections yesterday. Here is a preview by Andrew Teale. And here are the results. Harriet Harman, the Labour former deputy leader and the chair of the joint committee on human rights, has joked that so many moderate Tories are being driven out of the party that she is thinking of holding an inquiry. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks is legal, the high court in London has ruled, my colleague Owen Bowcott reports. Here is a question from below the line. I\u2019ll respond up here, because the answer might be of general interest. Emily Thornberry was referring specifically to this story by Jack Doyle and Jason Groves in the Daily Mail yesterday. This is how it starts. Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial enforcer warned a former cabinet minister he would be \u2018purged\u2019 if he stepped out of line on Brexit, Tory sources said last night. In an extraordinary phone rant, Dominic Cummings issued a direct threat to Greg Clark during a heated exchange ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s crunch vote allowing MPs to seize control of Commons business. A senior Tory source said Mr Cummings told former business secretary Mr Clark: \u2018When are you f***ing MPs going to realise we are leaving on October 31? We are going to purge you.\u2019 A second former minister confirmed the account, adding: \u2018This is the most reckless and vindictive handling of colleagues I have seen in my 20-odd years in parliament. It\u2019s a disaster \u2013 Cummings is out of control.\u2019 And here is another paragraph. Details of Mr Clark\u2019s phone call to Mr Cummings, confirmed by several sources, suggested it was made to discuss a possible compromise following a fractious meeting between rebels and Mr Johnson on Tuesday morning. The prime minister told Mr Clark to \u2018call Dom\u2019 to discuss the idea. But when he rang Mr Cummings, the PM\u2019s senior adviser is said to have opened the conversation with a brusque \u2018What do you want?\u2019 before launching into a rant and then hanging up. Like Labour, the Scottish National party will refuse to support Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed motion on Monday night calling for an early general election. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminister, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that his party wanted a general election, but did not trust Johnson to decide its timing. Blackford said: Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament so the idea that he is coming with a motion to try and force an election, having lost one this week, is insane. He is not going to compel parliamentarians to give him a mandate to determine the timing \u2013 we don\u2019t trust him. We\u2019ll determine the timing of this, not Boris Johnson. Like Emily Thornberry (see 9.01am), Blackford stressed the importance of ensuring the UK would not crash out of the EU on 31 October before allowing an election to take place. He said: I want [the election] to happen as soon as is practically possible, but I want us to secure the safety of not crashing out. It\u2019s balancing these things. Asked when it would be a good time to hold an election, he dodged the question. He said: As soon as is practically possible ... It\u2019s going to happen over the course of the next few weeks. We will choose the timing of that because Boris Johnson has lost his majority in parliament. The opposition parties are now effectively in control. Boris Johnson is not going to bounce us into a situation of his choosing. One option for the opposition parties would be to use a no confidence motion to try to bring down Johnson\u2019s government. Blackford said he would like such a vote to go ahead but if it happened this week and was successful, the fact that parliament is being prorogued could stop the opposition parties being able to use the 14 days available under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to form a new government. He explained: I would like us to have a motion of no confidence as soon as is practically possible. The problem we\u2019ve got is that we are going into prorogation next week. Even if we had a vote of no confidence, there is then a 14-day period when a government has to be put in place. Parliament is not sitting. So there are risks ... I would like a vote of no confidence provided we could control the process. But because of the prorogation of parliament, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that. So we have to be careful that we don\u2019t walk into a trap. Sir Michael Fallon, the former defence secretary, has joined the longish list of Tories who have decided to stand down at the next election. Fallon, 67, told the Today programme this morning that he was planning to stand down at the end of this parliament anyway, but he did express concerns about Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to purge the 21 Conservatives who rebelled against the government on Tuesday. He said he hoped they might have the whip restored. I would hope there would be some kind of appeal mechanism that they can find now so they get the chance to state their case. He also said the move sent out the wrong message to voters. I also worry that it sends the wrong message to remainers \u2013 particularly in my party. I think, by definition, some 5 million Conservatives must have voted remain and we have got to be very careful not to drive them into the hands of remainer parties like the Liberal Democrats in England or the Scottish nationalists in Scotland. Boris Johnson has been visiting Peterhead fish market in Scotland this morning. On the way out, he was doorstepped by Sky News, and asked if he accepted that Brexit might not happen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get out,\u201d he said, complaining about more \u201cpointless delay\u201d. Those are the only words we\u2019ve got so far, but Sky did broadcast some pictures. Sadly, he does not seem to be wearing the coat bearing the label \u201cprime minister\u201d that saw its first outing on his last visit to Scotland. Perhaps it\u2019s been allocated instead to Dominic Cummings? On Wednesday, when MPs debated Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election, Jeremy Corbyn said that Labour would be willing to vote for an election after the Hilary Benn bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October becomes law (which is due to happen by Monday). Corbyn said: I repeat what I said last night. Let this bill pass and gain royal assent, and then we will back an election\u2014so we do not crash out of the European Union with a no-deal exit. But, as we reported yesterday (eg see here and here), Corbyn has been coming under intense pressure from Labour MPs to delay the date of a possible early general election and this morning Emily Thornberry confirmed on the Today programme that, if Johnson goes ahead as planned with a second vote on an early election on Monday night, after the Benn bill has royal assent, Labour will still refuse to support the move. Asked if there would be a \u201cno\u201d from Labour on Monday, she replied: \u201cYes.\u201d She explained: The problem that we have is that the motion that the government has put before, and it looks like will put again, is a motion under the Fixed-term Parliament Act under clauses 2 (7) and 3 of the Fixed-term Parliament Act, if we vote to have a general election, then no matter what it is that Boris Johnson promises, it is up to him to advise the Queen when the general election should be. And given that he has shown himself to be a manifest liar, and someone who has said that he will die in a ditch rather than stop no deal, and indeed his adviser, [Dominic] Cummings, has been swearing and shouting at MPs saying they are leaving on 31 [October] no matter what, our first priority has to be that we must stop no deal and we must make sure that that is going to happen. In Labour there are different views on exactly when an early election should take place, and there is as yet no settled view. Yesterday John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, hinted that his preference was to \u201cgo long\u201d. Asked if she thought Labour should wait until after the EU summit in mid October, and until after an article 50 extension has been agreed, Thornberry replied: I\u2019m not going to go into details. But my instinct on this is the same as John\u2019s. Labour\u2019s position is crucial because, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a vote for an early election only gets implemented if two thirds of MPs in the House of Commons (434) vote for it. Following the rebellion on Tuesday, which led to 21 Tories losing the whip, Johnson now only has 289 seats in the Commons. We should be getting reaction from Boris Johnson later this morning. Here is the agenda for the day. Around 9am: Boris Johnson visits a farm in Scotland where he will announce extra funding for Scottish farmers. 10am: Jeremy Corbyn is due to hold a conference call with other opposition party leaders to discuss tactics on avoiding a no-deal Brexit and on the timing of a general election. 10am: Judges at the high court may announce their decision in the legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. 10am: Peers resume their debate on the Benn bill, intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. It is due to finish all its stages in the Lords by 5pm. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

He is Mike Bassett: England Prime Minister, yet wheels out jokes he\u2019s done 437 times before as though he\u2019s Frank Sinatra and reckons the crowd can\u2019t wait to see him do My Way again. Johnson must be the only performer whose audience spends his gigs screaming: PLEASE, DO YOUR NEW STUFF.</p> <p>Physically, he seems in a remarkable state. Apart from looking like he cuts his hair with the bacon scissors, the PM\u2019s shtick is bizarre and juddering, as though some of his innards are trying to escape.

His delivery was that of a man finding out in real time that material which slayed at the accountancy corporate he did in 2007 is less well received by those who haven\u2019t drunk themselves to within an hour of renal failure. That is as much as 30% of the House of Commons. I\u2019d give it a fortnight before Theresa May is waving an ironic \u201cWENGER IN\u201d banner behind him.</p> <p>As for his turns away from Westminster, Thursday afternoon found him at a Yorkshire police academy, where he appeared deeply confused. He resembled a political Elvis \u2013 twilight years \u2013 who\u2019d had to be slapped awake on the tour bus by his manager, given some of his special medicine, and shoved on to greet the LA crowd with the words \u201cHello Philadelphia!\u201d This, but in Wakefield.</p> <p>Having very belatedly taken the stage, Johnson proceeded to die on his arse in front of rows of police officers.

At the current rate, even Robert Caro will only need a week to write this Johnson biography. Then again, Johnson might get a majority, and we\u2019ll look back on these as the good old days. More on the prospect of that banter-apocalypse later. For now, it feels remarkable to think that barely five weeks ago, the vast majority of Tory MPs were telling us Boris Johnson was the only possible answer to various questions. It turns out those questions were: \u201cHow would Dudley Dursley and Draco Malfoy\u2019s baby look and behave?\u201d, \u201cWhat if you shaved the Honey Monster and put him in a suit for a court appearance?\u201d and \u201cDoes anyone know the ancient Greek for shitting the bed?\u201d. Despite practising since boyhood, Boris Johnson\u2019s entire demeanour is that of a man who has won a competition to lead the country for a day. He is Mike Bassett: England Prime Minister, yet wheels out jokes he\u2019s done 437 times before as though he\u2019s Frank Sinatra and reckons the crowd can\u2019t wait to see him do My Way again. Johnson must be the only performer whose audience spends his gigs screaming: PLEASE, DO YOUR NEW STUFF. Physically, he seems in a remarkable state. Apart from looking like he cuts his hair with the bacon scissors, the PM\u2019s shtick is bizarre and juddering, as though some of his innards are trying to escape. Perhaps they have found the tension between the bodily functions they are required to provide and the national interest unresolvable. Oratorically, his PMQs debut merits a mere five-word review: \u201cWelcome to the Commons, bitch.\u201d As a dispatch box artiste, Johnson has all the accomplishment of one of those pisshead chancers who go house to house at 10pm in December and \u201ccarol sing\u201d for pub money. His delivery was that of a man finding out in real time that material which slayed at the accountancy corporate he did in 2007 is less well received by those who haven\u2019t drunk themselves to within an hour of renal failure. That is as much as 30% of the House of Commons. I\u2019d give it a fortnight before Theresa May is waving an ironic \u201cWENGER IN\u201d banner behind him. As for his turns away from Westminster, Thursday afternoon found him at a Yorkshire police academy, where he appeared deeply confused. He resembled a political Elvis \u2013 twilight years \u2013 who\u2019d had to be slapped awake on the tour bus by his manager, given some of his special medicine, and shoved on to greet the LA crowd with the words \u201cHello Philadelphia!\u201d This, but in Wakefield. Having very belatedly taken the stage, Johnson proceeded to die on his arse in front of rows of police officers. Does this technically count as a death in custody? Certainly, it bore all the hallmarks of such an event, of which there have been 1,102 since 1990, with not a single conviction for murder or manslaughter. Which is to say: it was brutal and disturbing, it happened right in front of multiple police pretending not to notice, and the victim was officially concluded to have done it to himself. (Thank you in advance to the Police Federation for their forthcoming letters on this paragraph. I\u2019ll make time to to read them when I retire at 50 after three years on the sick.) There is much discussion about what really \u201ccut through\u201d this week, with Johnson\u2019s greatest shits collection set against such viral delights as a factual yet simultaneously car-crash delineation of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy by Emily Thornberry on Question Time. It is quite something to be got the better of by fellow panellist Richard Tice, a sort of radicalised Damart catalogue model, but the shadow foreign secretary managed it. As for Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, his insolent frontbench loll-about is still lighting up Facebook. I\u2019m not going to go full ad hominem on Nanny, who was probably only following orders, but I do think the time has come when we all have to ask: has anyone EVER done a worse job and stayed in post longer? She\u2019s still there! Jesus Christ, Nanny: YOU HAD ONE JOB. Teach him some manners, yes? Jacob Rees-Mogg is 50 (FIFTY). Is he even housebroken? Then again, why expect more from a guy who believes that even incestuously raped minors should be forced to give birth, at the same time as his investment fund profits from the sale of abortion pills? Asked about this hypocrisy once, Rees-Mogg declared airily: \u201cThe world is not always what you want it to be.\u201d You\u2019re telling me, mate. Very much ditto. With the world as it is, we have to tolerate the spectacle of the chancellor of the Duchy of Gilead spreading his loins all over the frontbench and comparing an NHS doctor who co-wrote official no-deal contingency plans to disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield. This last piece of utter yobbery saw Jacob humiliatingly ordered to apologise, presumably by Dominic Cummings (a man widely believed not to have completed the Norland Nanny training course). Perhaps it was terror of Cummings, then, that prevented Johnson from giving in to either basic human or political instinct, and assisting the faint policewoman in Wakefield. The PM chose instead to gibber out the last of his prepared lines, and the bulletins duly led with his claim that he\u2019d \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit. As for who would find his remains, it increasingly feels like a case for Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the pair of cops in Se7en, a movie in which various people are ritually deadly sinned to death. A man of many uncontrollable appetites, Boris Johnson has embodied each of the sins at points in his life, and this week it almost felt as if he was being strapped in like the glutton and forced to prime minister himself to death. Had enough prime ministering yet, dear? I think you can fit just a bit more prime ministering in, and a bit more, and a bit more, and \u2026 [Cut to shot of Pitt and Freeman battering down the door of No 10 and choking into their handkerchiefs]. Anyway, you get the idea with that one. I guess the major philosophical question facing some of us this week was: would it all be worth it? Would you take three years of political paralysis, a toxic public realm, bitter family rows and no prospect of even medium-term national healing just to watch this one absolute monster reap his own whirlwind, live on telly, in a horrifyingly hilarious cautionary tale about getting everything you always wanted? The answer, of course, is no. Not even close. And he might still get a majority. Having said all that \u2026 you\u2019ve got to get your kicks somehow in these dark times, and if you can\u2019t enjoy a good binfire, what\u2019s really left? So chuck another chair leg on the flames, take your warmth where you can, and try to get some rest before he takes a crack at next week. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2019 after a reader pointed out that the original figure of 1,718 included 1,102 for deaths in custody. The remaining figure related to deaths following other forms of contact with the police. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

Toner had been one of his mainstays, at provincial and international level, a player he valued and a man he liked, but he reached the decision based on form and an assessment of what was required to optimise the chances of success in the World Cup. Nothing else.</p> <p>Ireland, like Wales, used to be fuelled by emotion but both have been dragged into cold reality by New Zealanders. This weekend is Warren Gatland\u2019s final European match with Wales, in the country where he started his international coaching career in 1998. Like Schmidt, he regards selection not as a means of rewarding reputation, and with it the temptation to allow players to bow out at their own time of choosing, but winning the next match or campaign.</p> <p>Players who served him well found themselves suddenly cut off, like Adam Jones, Martyn Williams, Jamie Roberts and Dwayne Peel, Lions all. Gatland and Schmidt were born and brought up on New Zealand\u2019s north island and played provincial rugby: Gatland sat on New Zealand\u2019s bench for 18 matches without coming off it, an experience that sees him empathise rather than sympathise with players who unexpectedly find themselves on the outside.</p> <p>Schmidt and Gatland are the third head coaches from New Zealand employed by their countries and the latter will be succeeded by another, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/09/wayne-pivac-to-succeed-gatland-as-new-wales-rugby-union-coach-after-the-world-cup\" title=\"\">Wayne Pivac</a>, in November. When the two sides met during the group stage of the 1995 World Cup, they were the sick nations of the home championship, usually battling each other to avoid the wooden spoon. Ireland won by a point to send home Wales early, but their own exit was merely delayed and they were soundly beaten by France in the quarter-final.</p> <p>The two sides are unrecognisable now.</p> <p>Both sides have the chance of going to Japan top of the world rankings. A victory will do for Ireland but Wales must win by 15 points or more, something they have done only once in the last 109 years, in 1976. Not that either coach is obsessed with a system that reflects neither the status of a match nor whether teams are anywhere near full strength: both have the World Cup at the centre of their thoughts and leaving on the highest of highs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/06/wales-rhys-patchell-world-cup-excited\">Wales\u2019s Rhys Patchell: \u2018It\u2019s a long time since I have been this excited\u2019 | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ireland recovered from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/england-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">the shattering blow delivered by England</a> at Twickenham last month to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/31/wales-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">beat Wales in Cardiff</a> last Saturday. It was less redemption than recovery with their opponents making 15 changes for the return. Johnny Sexton, Robbie Henshaw and Keith Earls return to the home side\u2019s back division, while in the back-row Schmidt has moved CJ Stander to blindside flanker with Jack Conan at No 8, a hint they will mix directness with width.</p> <p>Ireland have been tactically rigid under Schmidt, as Wales were under Gatland earlier this decade, but as ball-in-play time increases and fatigue in the final quarter of matches becomes a greater factor, so the value of improvisation grows. Wales may not have turned into the Barbarians but handling and passing have become qualities they look for in tight-five forwards now.</p> <p>The success of Schmidt and Gatland was down to their immediate recognition that they were not dealing with players from New Zealand where instinct comes naturally. They have coached with a tight rein, but their achievements in the coming weeks may hinge on how much they are prepared to loosen them in attack.</p>",

Toner had been one of his mainstays, at provincial and international level, a player he valued and a man he liked, but he reached the decision based on form and an assessment of what was required to optimise the chances of success in the World Cup. Nothing else. Ireland, like Wales, used to be fuelled by emotion but both have been dragged into cold reality by New Zealanders. This weekend is Warren Gatland\u2019s final European match with Wales, in the country where he started his international coaching career in 1998. Like Schmidt, he regards selection not as a means of rewarding reputation, and with it the temptation to allow players to bow out at their own time of choosing, but winning the next match or campaign. Players who served him well found themselves suddenly cut off, like Adam Jones, Martyn Williams, Jamie Roberts and Dwayne Peel, Lions all. Gatland and Schmidt were born and brought up on New Zealand\u2019s north island and played provincial rugby: Gatland sat on New Zealand\u2019s bench for 18 matches without coming off it, an experience that sees him empathise rather than sympathise with players who unexpectedly find themselves on the outside. Schmidt and Gatland are the third head coaches from New Zealand employed by their countries and the latter will be succeeded by another, Wayne Pivac, in November. When the two sides met during the group stage of the 1995 World Cup, they were the sick nations of the home championship, usually battling each other to avoid the wooden spoon. Ireland won by a point to send home Wales early, but their own exit was merely delayed and they were soundly beaten by France in the quarter-final. The two sides are unrecognisable now. Both sides have the chance of going to Japan top of the world rankings. A victory will do for Ireland but Wales must win by 15 points or more, something they have done only once in the last 109 years, in 1976. Not that either coach is obsessed with a system that reflects neither the status of a match nor whether teams are anywhere near full strength: both have the World Cup at the centre of their thoughts and leaving on the highest of highs. Ireland recovered from the shattering blow delivered by England at Twickenham last month to beat Wales in Cardiff last Saturday. It was less redemption than recovery with their opponents making 15 changes for the return. Johnny Sexton, Robbie Henshaw and Keith Earls return to the home side\u2019s back division, while in the back-row Schmidt has moved CJ Stander to blindside flanker with Jack Conan at No 8, a hint they will mix directness with width. Ireland have been tactically rigid under Schmidt, as Wales were under Gatland earlier this decade, but as ball-in-play time increases and fatigue in the final quarter of matches becomes a greater factor, so the value of improvisation grows. Wales may not have turned into the Barbarians but handling and passing have become qualities they look for in tight-five forwards now. The success of Schmidt and Gatland was down to their immediate recognition that they were not dealing with players from New Zealand where instinct comes naturally. They have coached with a tight rein, but their achievements in the coming weeks may hinge on how much they are prepared to loosen them in attack.",

Such a move would remove the need for sanitary and phytosanitary checks (SPS) on animals and animal products crossing the border on the island of Ireland, although all other goods would not be covered and it would not deal with the issues of VAT and customs checks.</p> <p>Earlier in the week Johnson had referenced the comments of the former Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley who had said of Northern Ireland that the people were British but \u201cthe cattle were Irish\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson is insisting, in a move designed to make the proposal palatable to the DUP, that the arrangement would have to \u201cclearly enjoy the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest\u201d.</p> <p>It is understood the UK has suggested there is a need for Stormont to be able to vote on the continuation of the proposed common regulatory area, which has been described by EU officials as a \u201cbackstop-lite\u201d.</p> <p>EU sources said the suggestion was firmly rebuffed and that recent meetings had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d, with the gap between the two negotiating teams seemingly widening by the day.</p> <p>Sources said the discussion over the common agrifood area was \u201ccursory\u201d and further discussions over the UK\u2019s preferred alternative to the backstop were expected next week.</p> <p>Irish government sources reacted angrily to Johnson\u2019s gambit, saying the protection of the all-Ireland economy was a vital element of the Good Friday agreement, and that the responsibility for protecting the peace process lay with Westminster and not the Northern Ireland assembly.</p> <p>The UK government also sought to find a role for the Northern Ireland assembly in the future negotiations over the shared agrifood zone but an EU diplomat said there was a high degree of scepticism.</p> <p>The source said: \u201cThe EU negotiates with the UK authorities at the departing stage and not its constituent elements.</p> <p>\u201cHaving Stormont overturn an agreed and ratified agreement at a later stage prior to the backstop entering into force will undermine the withdrawal. A curious ask given the fact that currently Stormont hasn\u2019t sat for over two years?\u201d</p> <p>A UK government spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s sherpa David Frost and a cross-government team met officials from the commission\u2019s A50 taskforce today.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK team presented some preliminary ideas on how any all-island SPS solutions could involve the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest \u2013 something the prime minister referred to earlier this week in parliament. The discussions highlighted a number of issues which would need to be considered further and it was agreed that this would be discussed again next week.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s first concrete proposal for replacing the Irish backstop has hit the buffers in the latest \u201cdisastrous\u201d meeting between the prime minister\u2019s chief negotiator and the EU. In a heavily trailed move, Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, proposed an all-Ireland food standards zone on Friday, but the UK is also seeking to give the Stormont assembly a say on whether it would continue in the years ahead. The attempt to give the proposed arrangement what British officials have described as democratic legitimacy by involving politicians in Northern Ireland was firmly knocked back by the EU. European commission negotiators said such a proposal would leave Ireland in a constant state of uncertainty over the future. The development comes as EU sources close to the negotiation spoke of their doubts about the potential fruitfulness of the talks given the likelihood of a general election and the insistence from the prime minister that his negotiating position has been wrecked by no deal being taken off the table. EU officials involved in the negotiations are understood to have lamented that Frost has been acting \u201clike a spokesman\u201d for the prime minister, saying that Theresa May\u2019s envoy, Olly Robbins, had at least been able to talk around the problems encountered in the talks. EU sources said the commission would continue to meet with the British delegation for as long as Downing Street wished. Johnson is insisting in his attempted renegotiation that the Irish backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the whole of the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, must be ditched from the withdrawal agreement. Johnson has floated the idea of Northern Ireland staying aligned with EU standards on agrifoods, which make up a large proportion of the trade crossing the border with the Republic. Such a move would remove the need for sanitary and phytosanitary checks (SPS) on animals and animal products crossing the border on the island of Ireland, although all other goods would not be covered and it would not deal with the issues of VAT and customs checks. Earlier in the week Johnson had referenced the comments of the former Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley who had said of Northern Ireland that the people were British but \u201cthe cattle were Irish\u201d. Johnson is insisting, in a move designed to make the proposal palatable to the DUP, that the arrangement would have to \u201cclearly enjoy the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest\u201d. It is understood the UK has suggested there is a need for Stormont to be able to vote on the continuation of the proposed common regulatory area, which has been described by EU officials as a \u201cbackstop-lite\u201d. EU sources said the suggestion was firmly rebuffed and that recent meetings had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d, with the gap between the two negotiating teams seemingly widening by the day. Sources said the discussion over the common agrifood area was \u201ccursory\u201d and further discussions over the UK\u2019s preferred alternative to the backstop were expected next week. Irish government sources reacted angrily to Johnson\u2019s gambit, saying the protection of the all-Ireland economy was a vital element of the Good Friday agreement, and that the responsibility for protecting the peace process lay with Westminster and not the Northern Ireland assembly. The UK government also sought to find a role for the Northern Ireland assembly in the future negotiations over the shared agrifood zone but an EU diplomat said there was a high degree of scepticism. The source said: \u201cThe EU negotiates with the UK authorities at the departing stage and not its constituent elements. \u201cHaving Stormont overturn an agreed and ratified agreement at a later stage prior to the backstop entering into force will undermine the withdrawal. A curious ask given the fact that currently Stormont hasn\u2019t sat for over two years?\u201d A UK government spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s sherpa David Frost and a cross-government team met officials from the commission\u2019s A50 taskforce today. \u201cThe UK team presented some preliminary ideas on how any all-island SPS solutions could involve the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest \u2013 something the prime minister referred to earlier this week in parliament. The discussions highlighted a number of issues which would need to be considered further and it was agreed that this would be discussed again next week.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Seth Meyers: \u2018A pathological liar completely detached from reality\u2019 Late-night hosts continued to parse through the ridiculousness of Trump\u2019s response to Hurricane Dorian on Thursday Night. Seth Meyers took the broad view, connecting the president\u2019s Sharpie incident \u2013 in which he doctored a week-old map of the hurricane\u2019s path with a marker to defend his erroneous claim that it would hit the state of Alabama \u2013 to a long history of scams. \u201cWe know that Donald Trump is and has always been a conspiracy theorist and pathological liar who is completely detached from reality,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been his brand. It\u2019s just that back when he was a New York real estate buffoon, people didn\u2019t take it that seriously.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign for president started as an attempt to get people to take him seriously, Meyers explained, pointing to a clip from January 2016 when Trump basically said as much in a campaign speech: \u201cA lot of people have laughed at me over the years. Now they\u2019re not laughing so much, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d \u201cThat is something a villain would say in a superhero movie,\u201d Meyers said before playing a very similar line from the trailer of the new Joker movie (\u201cEveryone\u2019s laughed at me. Well, no one\u2019s laughing now.\u201d). Laughter aside, it\u2019s a serious matter, Meyers said, that the National Weather Service \u201chas to monitor the president\u2019s tweets as closely as they monitor actual hurricanes\u201d, referring to its immediate correction of Trump\u2019s false Alabama claim. \u201cWhen you think of it, Donald Trump is the hurricane. Except, unlike regular hurricanes that eventually die down, every day Trump blows harder.\u201d The whole bizarre Alabama-Dorian news cycle \u201cperfectly captures the constant, exhausting bewilderment of living through the Trump era\u201d, Meyers concluded. \u201cThere\u2019s a very real humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Bahamas, and a dangerous hurricane is threatening the mainland US, and meanwhile the president is obsessing over a map he doctored to defend an embarrassing mistake that he is now repeatedly lying about.\u201d Stephen Colbert: \u2018He\u2019s still obsessed with Alabama\u2019 As the Bahamas attempted to recover from Hurricane Dorian\u2019s devastation and the storm drenched the Carolinas, \u201cEveryone\u2019s thoughts are with the people down there,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. \u201cEveryone but Donald Trump\u2019s thoughts, because he\u2019s still obsessed with Alabama.\u201d Colbert referenced the president\u2019s tweets on Thursday morning which called for \u201cfake news apologies\u201d and defended, with a week-old map, his inaccurate claim that Alabama was in the storm\u2019s path. No one was apologizing, Colbert said, because the map proved nothing; first of all, it was not from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration but from the South Florida water management district. \u201cThat\u2019s like getting your MRI at Glamour Shots,\u201d Colbert joked. Furthermore, the map\u2019s fine print negated itself: \u201cNHC Advisories and County Emergency Management Statements supersede this product \u2026 If anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product.\u201d It\u2019s a strong statement, Colbert said, \u201calthough I gotta say: \u2018the entire product\u2019 is a very disrespectful way to describe the president of the United States\u201d. Colbert concluded on a sober note: \u201cThe storm surge has come ashore in the country that this man governs. Hundreds of thousands of people are presently without power.\u201d What\u2019s it going to be like when the president visits victims of the storm? Colbert asked as he slipped into Trump\u2019s voice: \u201cSo sad to see the damage here in South Carolina \u2013 or as many call it, East Alabama.\u201d Trevor Noah: \u2018We need him to pull out that magic Sharpie of his\u2019 On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah acknowledged that while Hurricane Dorian dominated the headlines, the conversation about climate change was happening all over the world \u2013 especially in light of the disastrous fires in Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforest. Noah showed a news report on the record fires \u2013 burning across an area two-thirds the size of the continental United States \u2013 including a huge blaze in which 30 firefighters attempted to beat it back by literally kicking the flames. \u201cJust kicking the fire?\u201d Noah asked, incredulous. \u201cThey\u2019re dealing with a forest fire the same way I deal with an ice cube on the floor?\u201d The fires are a huge problem for Brazil, Noah continued, but \u201cthe real problem is that it\u2019s the world issue\u201d since the rainforest is critical to keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

      "body": "<p>When answers are in short supply, sometimes the best we can do is try to ask the right questions.

This is the prize the opposition has agreed to deny him, forcing him, they hope, to confront the electorate in November as a failure, guilty of either treachery or incompetence. Their hope is that Johnson\u2019s inability to take Britain out of the EU will pump new air into the Brexit party balloon, thereby splitting the leave vote that Johnson had bet everything on uniting around himself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/05/johnson-winner-prime-minister-election-people-parliament\">Johnson is acting like a winner. But reality may have other ideas | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s risk here too. Some Labour MPs fear that fury among pro-Brexit voters will be at its peak in the immediate aftermath of 31 October, as those voters realise they\u2019ve been cheated of Brexit once again, that London / the elite / Labour / remainers have consigned them to another spell in European \u201cpurgatory\u201d. In this view, leavers will rally to Johnson\u2019s cry of treachery, seeing him as their defiant, relentless tribune. They won\u2019t be diverted to Nigel Farage because Johnson will be supplying the same populist drug, as illustrated by his slash-and-burn antics this week. According to one former cabinet minister, \u201cHe has decided to beat the Brexit party by being the Brexit party.\u201d</p> <p>Second question: what cuts through? Or, put another way, what\u2019s the signal amid all this noise? For those watching closely, glued to Twitter or following rolling news, the last week has been extraordinary. If they\u2019re not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/sit-up-jacob-rees-mogg-under-fire-for-slouching-in-commons\" title=\"\">sharing pictures</a> of a languid Jacob Rees-Mogg sprawled on the Commons benches, expressing contempt for parliament in physical form, they\u2019ve been gasping at the gall of a Tory PM purging his party of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/hammond-clashes-with-johnson-in-run-up-to-commons-showdown\" title=\"\">some of its grandest figures</a>, two ex-chancellors included, and at the remarkable feat of a new prime minister losing his first four Commons votes. But how much of that gets through to the vast bulk of voters, who might catch the odd bit of news on TV, a few headlines on commercial music radio or via Facebook? While your Twitter feed was spitting outraged noise at the culling of Nicholas Soames, it\u2019s possible that the signal was \u201cPM fights hard for Brexit.\u201d</p> <p> An example came on Thursday night, when Johnson delivered a rambling speech in front of a phalanx of police cadets, wilting in the sun. In Westminster world, following the entire event live, the focus was on the sinister, Trumpian use of cops as props and on the PM\u2019s bizarre incoherence. But the five-second clip on the Six O\u2019Clock News showed a PM backed by police saying he\u2019d rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit. Despite the noise, that signal might be all he needed.</p> <p>The challenge is to tell one from the other. Some might be tempted to think that the resignation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/jo-johnson-quits-as-mp-and-minister-citing-national-interest\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s brother, Jo,</a> is also a mere soap opera twist of import only to the bubble. Wrong. Pollster Deborah Mattinson of BritainThinks reckons, \u201cThe brother thing could be a game changer\u201d and will \u201cdefinitely cut through.\u201d Labour\u2019s line \u2013 \u201cIf Boris Johnson\u2019s own brother doesn\u2019t trust him, why should you?\u201d \u2013 is hugely powerful, says Mattinson, who notes that focus groups still bring up the Miliband brothers, nearly 10 years after they competed against each other. The sheer human drama of siblings at war is compelling. \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff of our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Third question: who unites their tribe? This will be decisive, and it\u2019s why the battle over timing has been so intense. If Johnson can unite the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/referendum-results-by-constituency/\" title=\"\">pro-Brexit tribe</a>, he can win \u2013 not least because there are more than 400 parliamentary seats that voted leave in 2016. Hence his 35%, core vote strategy. Labour\u2019s only hope is that it can pull off, and improve on, what it <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40630242\" title=\"\">achieved</a> in 2017, when it brought most remainers under its banner.</p> <p>If there is a strategy underpinning Johnson\u2019s recent moves, it\u2019s that desire to ensure hardcore Brexiters have no need to look elsewhere. But it\u2019s fraught with peril. For one thing, it all but writes off the 39% of Conservatives who voted remain, discarding seats in Scotland, London and the south-west. For another, it assumes that onetime Labour voters in the Midlands and northern England who voted leave, and even for Farage, won\u2019t have a visceral resistance to voting Tory. But they might.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Labour has to hope that the last two years of triangulation on Brexit will somehow be forgotten and forgiven by committed remainers. Recall that four in 10 Labour voters backed the Liberal Democrats in May\u2019s European elections. How can Labour win them back? In an October election the pitch would have been simple: vote Labour to block an imminent no-deal crash-out from the EU. But if and when an extension has been granted, that appeal will lose much of its unifying urgency. Keep an eye too on the so-called Clause V group that will draw up the next manifesto, in which Len McCluskey and the pro-Brexit figures in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s inner circle loom large. If what emerges is a manifesto promise of a Labour Brexit, two things will happen. Labour spokespeople will tangle themselves in knots, as they explain that Labour will both seek a Brexit deal and campaign not to Brexit. (For a preview, watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tobias_Ellwood/status/1169883689418801154\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry\u2019s discomfort on Thursday\u2019s Question Time</a>.) And the Lib Dems will have a chance to make a breakthrough, promising a policy as unambiguously against Brexit as Johnson\u2019s is for it.</p> <p>There are other questions too, of course. Will Johnson be as poor on the campaign trail as he has been this week? Will Corbyn be as good as his backers believe he was in 2017? Or are both now known quantities in the public mind, with little chance of a recurrence of the shifts in opinion that struck two years ago? Will Johnson have the slogan of \u201cGet Brexit over with\u201d all to himself, or could Jo Swinson challenge him by promising to end this national nightmare by revoking article 50? Rarely has there been more uncertainty about an imminent election, from its date to its likely outcome. Only one thing is already known: the stakes are almost unbearably high.</p> <p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But how much of that gets through to the vast bulk of voters, who might catch the odd bit of news on TV, a few headlines on commercial music radio or via Facebook? While your Twitter feed was spitting outraged noise at the culling of Nicholas Soames, it\u2019s possible that the signal was \u201cPM fights hard for Brexit.\u201d An example came on Thursday night, when Johnson delivered a rambling speech in front of a phalanx of police cadets, wilting in the sun. In Westminster world, following the entire event live, the focus was on the sinister, Trumpian use of cops as props and on the PM\u2019s bizarre incoherence. But the five-second clip on the Six O\u2019Clock News showed a PM backed by police saying he\u2019d rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit. Despite the noise, that signal might be all he needed. The challenge is to tell one from the other. Some might be tempted to think that the resignation of Johnson\u2019s brother, Jo, is also a mere soap opera twist of import only to the bubble. Wrong. Pollster Deborah Mattinson of BritainThinks reckons, \u201cThe brother thing could be a game changer\u201d and will \u201cdefinitely cut through.\u201d Labour\u2019s line \u2013 \u201cIf Boris Johnson\u2019s own brother doesn\u2019t trust him, why should you?\u201d \u2013 is hugely powerful, says Mattinson, who notes that focus groups still bring up the Miliband brothers, nearly 10 years after they competed against each other. The sheer human drama of siblings at war is compelling. \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff of our lives.\u201d Third question: who unites their tribe? This will be decisive, and it\u2019s why the battle over timing has been so intense. If Johnson can unite the pro-Brexit tribe, he can win \u2013 not least because there are more than 400 parliamentary seats that voted leave in 2016. Hence his 35%, core vote strategy. Labour\u2019s only hope is that it can pull off, and improve on, what it achieved in 2017, when it brought most remainers under its banner. If there is a strategy underpinning Johnson\u2019s recent moves, it\u2019s that desire to ensure hardcore Brexiters have no need to look elsewhere. But it\u2019s fraught with peril. For one thing, it all but writes off the 39% of Conservatives who voted remain, discarding seats in Scotland, London and the south-west. For another, it assumes that onetime Labour voters in the Midlands and northern England who voted leave, and even for Farage, won\u2019t have a visceral resistance to voting Tory. But they might. Meanwhile, Labour has to hope that the last two years of triangulation on Brexit will somehow be forgotten and forgiven by committed remainers. Recall that four in 10 Labour voters backed the Liberal Democrats in May\u2019s European elections. How can Labour win them back? In an October election the pitch would have been simple: vote Labour to block an imminent no-deal crash-out from the EU. But if and when an extension has been granted, that appeal will lose much of its unifying urgency. Keep an eye too on the so-called Clause V group that will draw up the next manifesto, in which Len McCluskey and the pro-Brexit figures in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s inner circle loom large. If what emerges is a manifesto promise of a Labour Brexit, two things will happen. Labour spokespeople will tangle themselves in knots, as they explain that Labour will both seek a Brexit deal and campaign not to Brexit. (For a preview, watch Emily Thornberry\u2019s discomfort on Thursday\u2019s Question Time.) And the Lib Dems will have a chance to make a breakthrough, promising a policy as unambiguously against Brexit as Johnson\u2019s is for it. There are other questions too, of course. Will Johnson be as poor on the campaign trail as he has been this week? Will Corbyn be as good as his backers believe he was in 2017? Or are both now known quantities in the public mind, with little chance of a recurrence of the shifts in opinion that struck two years ago? Will Johnson have the slogan of \u201cGet Brexit over with\u201d all to himself, or could Jo Swinson challenge him by promising to end this national nightmare by revoking article 50? Rarely has there been more uncertainty about an imminent election, from its date to its likely outcome. Only one thing is already known: the stakes are almost unbearably high.

The introduction of education, health and care plans (EHCPs) in 2014 was followed by a steep increase in the number of children and young people with special needs and disabilities (Send) in England, with local authorities and schools complaining of funding shortages, and families of long delays in receiving diagnoses and support. \u201cOur reforms in 2014 gave vital support to more children but we know there have been problems in delivering the changes that we all want to see. So it\u2019s the right time to take stock of our system and make sure the excellence we want to see as a result of our changes is the norm for every child and their families,\u201d Williamson said in announcing the review. Last week the government said that special needs education in England would receive an extra \u00a3700m from next year, which Williamson said was \u201cto make sure these children can access the education that is right for them\u201d. The Department for Education (DfE) said the review would look at how support had \u201cevolved\u201d since 2014, and tackle the lottery of provision that sees children in one area receiving less than children with the same needs in another area. It will also look at balancing provision across mainstream and specialist schools, and how support is linked across health, care and education services. About 1.3 million school-age pupils in England are classed as having special educational needs \u2013 15% of the pupil population, according to DfE figures \u2013 while the number with EHCPs has risen from 271,000 to more than 350,000 this year. The review was welcomed by charities and interest groups, although some expressed scepticism over when the review would be completed given the turmoil of Westminster politics. \u201cAfter years of cuts, years of parents being pushed to breaking point, and years of underachievement because children have just not been given the support they need to thrive, this review and \u00a3700m investment couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Ian Noon, the chief policy adviser at the National Deaf Children\u2019s Society. \u201cThe last major government review of special needs education five years ago saw huge upheaval to the system, but little improvement to how many children were supported. \u201cThis [review] has the potential to be a gamechanger for children with special needs.

      "bodyText": "Hiring slowed in the US in August as employers added a lackluster 130,00 new jobs, strengthening arguments that Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars are beginning to hit the US economy. Economists had expected the US to add about 160,000 new jobs over the month. While the labor department announced the unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, the pace of hiring slowed markedly, down from an average of 192,000 new jobs a month last year to 143,000 so far this year. The figures were particularly worrying for the president. Mining, an industry where Trump has promised to bring back jobs, lost 5,000 positions over the month. Manufacturing added just 3,000 jobs and June and July\u2019s figures were revised down. Factory production has declined for two consecutive quarters, according to the Federal Reserve, and is already technically in recession. Trump dismissed suggestions the report was anything less than stellar. August\u2019s figures were also boosted by the US government hiring 25,000 temporary workers to conduct its 2020 national census. And the report cut its assessments for job gains for June and July by a total of 20,000. After the news broke Trump resumed his attack on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you can\u2019t win them all!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Trump has consistently blamed the Fed for slowing economic growth by refusing to quickly cut interest rates despite the fact that they remain historically low and have throughout the economic recovery. The US jobs report comes as fears of a global recession are escalating. The European Central Bank has signaled it is planning to cut interest rates and announce a new stimulus package. The moves come as the latest industrial production figures from Germany give \u201ca convincing signal that Germany is in recession\u201d, Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said on Friday. \u201cThe 130,000 gain in non-farm payroll employment in August was flattered by the hiring of 25,000 temporary workers to help prepare for next year\u2019s census. More generally, there has been a clear slowdown in trend employment growth, particularly in the private sector, with the six-month average monthly gain below 150,000,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. He said revisions that will be incorporated into the data early next year will probably knock another 500,000 jobs off the overall gains in employment over the year, meaning the current average monthly jobs gain will be closer to 110,000.

Wage growth, which has lagged behind the recovery in the jobs market, has also started to pick up and rose at an annual rate of 3.2% in August. The report will do little, however, to assuage fears that the long-running trade dispute between the US and China will hit the global economy. Last month Trump ordered US firms to \u201cimmediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME\u201d as he announced a new round of tariffs. China and the US will meet to discuss trade tensions next month and Chinese officials have recently signaled that they would like to repair relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",

Gentle-voiced and crinkly eyed and played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-rylance\">Mark Rylance</a>, he sees his comfortable equanimity shattered by the arrival of state security officers. They\u2019re led by Depp, who looks more like a skull wrapped in butcher\u2019s paper every day. Evocatively photographed by Chris Menges in Morocco as well as Italy, Guerra\u2019s stately, frequently horrific fifth feature recalls both Kafka\u2019s In the Penal Colony and Graham Greene, with Rylance as a sad sack powerless to stop the ruthlessly mechanical infliction of pain.</p> <p>Chapter headings that cycle through the seasons signpost the unravelling that occurs after Depp\u2019s Colonel Joll arrives for an inspection and begins torturing the locals. A nomad accused of stealing a sheep has his eye gouged out, but not before \u201cadmitting\u201d that his people are readying for a full-blown frontier war. That news, as well as the magistrate\u2019s discomfort with the colonel\u2019s methods, is reported up the chain, leading to further intervention from the navy-suited state police. It\u2019s easy to read the film as a not particularly subtle metaphor for fascism or \u201cthe war on terror\u201d, and its black hats aren\u2019t so much characters as automatons.</p> <p>Hair slicked back and parted down the middle, Depp sports a natty pair of circular sunglasses that obscure the colonel\u2019s eyes and emotions, if indeed he has any. Working again with the kind of indie auteur he gravitated towards before his 15-year run as a blockbuster star, the actor makes a meal of some of his lines here, but he seems positively relaxed next to Pattinson, playing a variation on the diabolical theme.</p> <p>Pattinson is a puzzle. Such a revelation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/25/good-time-review-robert-pattinson-safdie-brothers-cannes-2017\">Good Time</a>, and charismatically enigmatic in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/13/lost-city-z-review-amazon-drama-james-gray-charlie-hunnam-percival-fawcett-conrad-jungle\">The Lost City of Z</a>, he just as often looks uncomfortable. His performance here is somehow both stiff and overarticulated. At least he gets one of the film\u2019s best lines, when he thanks the residents of the fort he\u2019s terrorised for their hospitality, then scarpers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/embrace-of-the-serpent-review-a-kurtzian-vision-of-the-amazon\">Embrace of the Serpent review \u2013 a Kurtzian vision of the Amazon</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000627/\">Greta Scacchi</a> has a thankless role as a cook running Rylance\u2019s household, but the magistrate\u2019s key relationship is with an Indigenous woman (Gana Bayarsaikhan) crippled by Depp\u2019s toadies. His deepening affection for her leads him into the desert to return the girl to her people, and some of the widescreen compositions in this section \u2013 of stucco parapets silhouetted against a darkening blue sky, of riders ringed by bands of sun-gold at dusk \u2013 have a startling beauty. But the grandeur of the wide open spaces is short lived, and on the magistrate\u2019s return he\u2019s thrown into a cell for treating with the enemy.</p> <p>His rejection by the woman he loves but failed to protect presages a more pointed reckoning, and the magistrate is left, in the end, holding the bag. Guerra has tweaked the novel\u2019s Beckettian coda, and the film\u2019s final shot provides a full stop that is, in 2019, appropriately apocalyptic. The barbarians are us, and the wait is over. <br></p> <p><br></p>",

Gentle-voiced and crinkly eyed and played by Mark Rylance, he sees his comfortable equanimity shattered by the arrival of state security officers. They\u2019re led by Depp, who looks more like a skull wrapped in butcher\u2019s paper every day. Evocatively photographed by Chris Menges in Morocco as well as Italy, Guerra\u2019s stately, frequently horrific fifth feature recalls both Kafka\u2019s In the Penal Colony and Graham Greene, with Rylance as a sad sack powerless to stop the ruthlessly mechanical infliction of pain. Chapter headings that cycle through the seasons signpost the unravelling that occurs after Depp\u2019s Colonel Joll arrives for an inspection and begins torturing the locals. A nomad accused of stealing a sheep has his eye gouged out, but not before \u201cadmitting\u201d that his people are readying for a full-blown frontier war. That news, as well as the magistrate\u2019s discomfort with the colonel\u2019s methods, is reported up the chain, leading to further intervention from the navy-suited state police. It\u2019s easy to read the film as a not particularly subtle metaphor for fascism or \u201cthe war on terror\u201d, and its black hats aren\u2019t so much characters as automatons. Hair slicked back and parted down the middle, Depp sports a natty pair of circular sunglasses that obscure the colonel\u2019s eyes and emotions, if indeed he has any. Working again with the kind of indie auteur he gravitated towards before his 15-year run as a blockbuster star, the actor makes a meal of some of his lines here, but he seems positively relaxed next to Pattinson, playing a variation on the diabolical theme. Pattinson is a puzzle. Such a revelation in Good Time, and charismatically enigmatic in The Lost City of Z, he just as often looks uncomfortable. His performance here is somehow both stiff and overarticulated. At least he gets one of the film\u2019s best lines, when he thanks the residents of the fort he\u2019s terrorised for their hospitality, then scarpers. Greta Scacchi has a thankless role as a cook running Rylance\u2019s household, but the magistrate\u2019s key relationship is with an Indigenous woman (Gana Bayarsaikhan) crippled by Depp\u2019s toadies. His deepening affection for her leads him into the desert to return the girl to her people, and some of the widescreen compositions in this section \u2013 of stucco parapets silhouetted against a darkening blue sky, of riders ringed by bands of sun-gold at dusk \u2013 have a startling beauty. But the grandeur of the wide open spaces is short lived, and on the magistrate\u2019s return he\u2019s thrown into a cell for treating with the enemy. His rejection by the woman he loves but failed to protect presages a more pointed reckoning, and the magistrate is left, in the end, holding the bag. Guerra has tweaked the novel\u2019s Beckettian coda, and the film\u2019s final shot provides a full stop that is, in 2019, appropriately apocalyptic. The barbarians are us, and the wait is over.",

      "bodyText": "The government must not allow the prorogation of parliament to further delay the introduction of new domestic abuse laws, campaigners have said, arguing that survivors cannot wait any longer for \u201ccritical protections and support\u201d. Attempts to improve the laws relating to domestic abuse have suffered numerous setbacks in recent years. Proposed changes in legislation to prevent perpetrators cross-examining victims in the family courts were initially included in the prisons and courts bill 2017, which was abandoned when Theresa May called the 2017 general election. A number of measures were then included in the domestic abuse bill, which was finally introduced to parliament in July this year, but charities and campaigners are seeking assurances that the legislation will not be dropped again in the current political turmoil. In a letter to the prime minister, leading domestic abuse charities, academics and human rights organisations called for the government to make a clear public commitment to deliver the bill within the next parliamentary session. \u201cWe are writing to seek assurance that vital legislation to protect survivors of domestic abuse remains a priority for the government,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe domestic abuse bill is a pivotal moment. Crucially, it will enable the UK government to ratify the Istanbul convention, the landmark international treaty for preventing and combating violence against women.\u201d Among other proposals, the bill contains measures to introduce a statutory government definition of domestic abuse, which would include economic abuse, and the creation of domestic abuse protection notices and domestic abuse protection orders to put restrictions on offenders. Responding to a question by the MP Jess Phillips in parliament on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said the government would \u201censure that the domestic abuse bill, the animal welfare (sentencing) bill and other bills receive proper consideration and are rolled over.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is absolutely committed to legislating to support victims of domestic abuse. The forthcoming Queen\u2019s speech will set out our legislative agenda for the next session of parliament.\u201d Phillips told the Guardian that she had been told by well-informed people that the government was considering dropping the bill. \u201cYou have to look at the language that [the government] used this week, which is that it is in review, that they \u2018very much expect it\u2019 to be carried forward,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the government wants to keep the domestic abuse bill and relaunch it then why won\u2019t they just come out and say it?\u201d The MP for Birmingham Yardley said the former communities secretary James Brokenshire \u2013 who was sacked by Johnson in July \u2013 had promised \u00a319m to fund women\u2019s refuges, but that nothing had been confirmed in this week\u2019s spending review. \u201cThis is about people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not some bloody game.\u201d The letter was signed by organisations including Women\u2019s Aid, Refuge, Imkaan and the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice. \u201cOver the past two years, survivors, frontline specialist services, parliamentarians and the organisations listed \u2026 have provided significant expertise to the development of this legislation to ensure it achieves its full potential,\u201d they said. The organisations stressed that survivors had shared their experiences of domestic abuse with the government and that it was crucial that \u201ctheir courage and determination to improve legal protection for women and children in the future is listened to and acted on\u201d. \u201cThe bill has already suffered a number of delays, and survivors cannot wait any longer for critical protections and support,\u201d they added.",

Best is Ronald K Brown\u2019s The Call, which takes a gentle stroll through Bach, jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams and west African beats \u2013 in tribute to some of Ailey\u2019s influences. It\u2019s dance that\u2019s warm and welcoming, as Ailey\u2019s performers always are. At Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. Programme A runs until 14 September; Programme B runs until 13 September; Programme C runs 10-14 September.",

One is the centrality of parliament; the other is that key aspects depend on politics, not law. Sadly, the weaknesses in such a system have now been demonstrated \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/28/boris-johnson-election-prorogue-parliament-populist-majority\" title=\"\">an officeholder who rejects convention</a> and seeks to push powers to their legal limit. Suddenly, a previously stable system has shown itself to be fragile.</p> <p>The biggest shock to the system was clearly Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament \u2013 a request seemingly made without prior agreement by the cabinet, and which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/28/spending-review-set-for-next-week-fuels-election-speculation-live\" title=\"\">greeted with </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/28/spending-review-set-for-next-week-fuels-election-speculation-live\" title=\"\">outrage</a> by opposition parties and protests from some quarters of the public.</p> <p>The prorogation undoubtedly broke with constitutional precedent. Despite <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/jacob-rees-mogg-prorogation-4786822-Aug2019/\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s protestations</a> that it was \u201croutine\u201d \u2013 at five weeks this is the longest prorogation in 90 years. The Commons was previously heading for a conference recess, but MPs were <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-no-deal-brexit-october-recess-cancelled-party-conference-a9046446.html\" title=\"\">set to vote</a> on cancelling that, and seemed likely to succeed. Johnson\u2019s move deliberately deprived them of that opportunity, as well as the right to scrutinise his government \u2013 hence demonstrating a major loophole. While MPs have a decisive role in dissolving parliament for a general election, or adjourning for a recess, prorogation lies purely in the executive\u2019s hands. This power must now be removed from the executive and handed to parliament, in line with the power to dissolve or to adjourn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6aab4125f9804017584a5ff77dfb91662a174544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aab4125f9804017584a5ff77dfb91662a174544/0_21_2558_1535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Rees-Mogg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Despite Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s protestations that the prorogation was \u2018routine\u2019, at five weeks it is the longest prorogation in 90 years.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other executive powers have also been brought into question this week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords-agree-to-push-through-bill-preventing-no-deal-by-end-of-friday\" title=\"\">The Benn </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords-agree-to-push-through-bill-preventing-no-deal-by-end-of-friday\" title=\"\">bill</a>, passed against the prime minister\u2019s wishes, to require him to request an article 50 extension if no Brexit deal is agreed, was subject to various threats. One was that it might be denied royal assent \u2013 through ministers advising the Queen not to sign it into law, despite having passed through both chambers of parliament. This would be extreme action indeed, and might well have failed. But even raising such a suggestion introduces confusion, and (like prorogation) risks bringing the monarch into controversy.</p> <p>Another claim was that the bill might fall prey to \u201cQueen\u2019s consent\u201d (a different and more unusual procedure than royal assent), allowing ministers to block it at an earlier stage. Such procedures are essentially ancient relics, usually of limited practical effect \u2013 but in far from \u201cnormal\u201d times, with a government intent on blocking the will of parliament, their existence becomes problematic.</p> <p>Parliament\u2019s own more routine procedures have also been shown as wanting in key respects. The House of Commons\u2019 standing orders give the government very significant control over allocation of parliamentary time. For example, while opposition parties are guaranteed a number of days on which they can choose the topic for debate, ministers decide when those days are given \u2013 allowing them to block awkward matters from the agenda. More generally, time in the House of Commons is by default largely controlled by the government. Hence the need for MPs\u2019 repeated attempts to \u201cseize control of the agenda\u201d over Brexit \u2013 as, most recently, with the tabling of the Benn bill this week.</p> <p>Usually, government control of the agenda is largely unproblematic. But under a minority government it becomes highly questionable whether ministers, rather than a parliamentary majority, should decide what gets discussed. In countries such as Germany, parliamentary time is instead proportionately shared between different groups.

      "bodyText": "Recent events in British politics have stretched the capacity of our constitutional norms to their limits. But what have they collectively taught us? They highlight worrying weaknesses \u2013 but also some less-discussed strengths. Two key features lie at the heart of the British constitution. One is the centrality of parliament; the other is that key aspects depend on politics, not law. Sadly, the weaknesses in such a system have now been demonstrated \u2013 by an officeholder who rejects convention and seeks to push powers to their legal limit. Suddenly, a previously stable system has shown itself to be fragile. The biggest shock to the system was clearly Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament \u2013 a request seemingly made without prior agreement by the cabinet, and which was greeted with outrage by opposition parties and protests from some quarters of the public. The prorogation undoubtedly broke with constitutional precedent. Despite Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s protestations that it was \u201croutine\u201d \u2013 at five weeks this is the longest prorogation in 90 years. The Commons was previously heading for a conference recess, but MPs were set to vote on cancelling that, and seemed likely to succeed. Johnson\u2019s move deliberately deprived them of that opportunity, as well as the right to scrutinise his government \u2013 hence demonstrating a major loophole. While MPs have a decisive role in dissolving parliament for a general election, or adjourning for a recess, prorogation lies purely in the executive\u2019s hands. This power must now be removed from the executive and handed to parliament, in line with the power to dissolve or to adjourn. Other executive powers have also been brought into question this week. The Benn bill, passed against the prime minister\u2019s wishes, to require him to request an article 50 extension if no Brexit deal is agreed, was subject to various threats. One was that it might be denied royal assent \u2013 through ministers advising the Queen not to sign it into law, despite having passed through both chambers of parliament. This would be extreme action indeed, and might well have failed. But even raising such a suggestion introduces confusion, and (like prorogation) risks bringing the monarch into controversy. Another claim was that the bill might fall prey to \u201cQueen\u2019s consent\u201d (a different and more unusual procedure than royal assent), allowing ministers to block it at an earlier stage. Such procedures are essentially ancient relics, usually of limited practical effect \u2013 but in far from \u201cnormal\u201d times, with a government intent on blocking the will of parliament, their existence becomes problematic. Parliament\u2019s own more routine procedures have also been shown as wanting in key respects. The House of Commons\u2019 standing orders give the government very significant control over allocation of parliamentary time. For example, while opposition parties are guaranteed a number of days on which they can choose the topic for debate, ministers decide when those days are given \u2013 allowing them to block awkward matters from the agenda. More generally, time in the House of Commons is by default largely controlled by the government. Hence the need for MPs\u2019 repeated attempts to \u201cseize control of the agenda\u201d over Brexit \u2013 as, most recently, with the tabling of the Benn bill this week. Usually, government control of the agenda is largely unproblematic. But under a minority government it becomes highly questionable whether ministers, rather than a parliamentary majority, should decide what gets discussed. In countries such as Germany, parliamentary time is instead proportionately shared between different groups. In fragmented political times with the potential for minority governments to become more frequent, revision of the rules appears an urgent priority \u2013 to avoid the kind of unseemly procedural arguments witnessed over Brexit. Alongside all of these problems, however, this week also demonstrated one part of the constitution working exactly as it should. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) 2011 had been accused of toothlessness after Theresa May called an election three years early in 2017. This may have fooled Johnson into believing the age-old power by which the prime minister could decide general election dates essentially still existed \u2013 hence his attempt to bump his opponents into a \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d election. But having put down an FTPA motion for an early election he simply demonstrated how the act actually gives MPs real power. They defeated his proposal, and look set to do so again next week. The sustainability of executive powers to prorogue, or to recommend assent to bills, depends on a political framework where long-held conventions about not abusing such power are respected. The inevitable consequence of all the strains placed on our constitution by the arrival of a prime minister prepared to flout such limits seems to be that, in due course, we will need to write down more of our rules in law. That doesn\u2019t mean a move to a written constitution \u2013 for now, at least. But it does mean creating more statute law \u2013 like the Fixed-term Parliaments Act \u2013 to constrain the government\u2019s remaining prerogative powers. \u2022 Meg Russell is professor of British and comparative politics, and director of the constitution unit at UCL.

They need to get away but often they can\u2019t afford it if they have got families.\u201d</p> <p>He said they often struggled to cover everyday costs, such as fixing a broken washing machine or paying for new school uniforms. Many clergy had an \u201cinnate tendency not to come forward for help\u201d, Moodey added, also expressing concern for those who suffered relationship breakdown.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of: \u2018There are many in my congregation who are worse off than me. Why should I regard myself as a special case?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the case of the vicar who was forced to use a payday loan firm, Moodey said: \u201cHe is now working through a debt repayment plan with a debt advice charity which is a partner of ours, with some help from us to get that sorted.\u201d</p> <p>Welby has previously attacked payday lenders, but his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/26/archbishop-of-canterbury-church-wonga\">criticism backfired</a> when it emerged the C of E held an indirect investment in the now defunct Wonga. Moodey said: \u201cPayday lenders are causing significant suffering amongst the wider population and you would hope that clergy would be able to mirror what is the church\u2019s position which is that, actually, payday lenders are bad news. But if you\u2019re desperate and you really can\u2019t make ends meet, then desperate people do desperate things.\u201d</p> <p>Most vicars receive a stipend of up to \u00a327,886 plus housing but there are nearly 3,000 \u201cself-supporting\u201d ministers who are not paid, according to newly released C of E figures. The C of E\u2019s website lists a series of adverts for \u201chouse for duty\u201d roles, which are unpaid.</p> <p>The majority of vicars receiving grants from Clergy Support Trust are in stipend roles but some are in non-stipend roles. Since the start of 2018, 7% of non-retired clergy helped by the charity were \u201cself-supporting\u201d. While for non-stipendiary vicars \u2013 who tend to be older and getting pensions from other careers \u2013 not being paid is often a choice, some do struggle financially, especially those in retirement.</p> <p>Wilson said: \u201cMental health issues pose an increasing challenge, and I worry about retired non-stipendiary clergy and some clergy spouses who are in real difficulties. There is always more to be done, not only for individuals who are struggling, but in order to understand the underlying trends. Above all, it\u2019s important that people experiencing problems alert archdeacons and bishops to what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>A C of E spokeswoman said: \u201cWe take the wellbeing of our 20,000 clergy extremely seriously. We note with concern the cases highlighted by Clergy Support Trust and we are grateful for its support for clergy struggling financially, as well as for the work of the Churches\u2019 Mutual Credit Union, launched in 2015 with the backing of the Church of England.</p> <p>\u201cProblem debt is a widespread and serious issue in our society and it is worrying that a group of clergy is also affected.\u201d</p> <p>The C of E said it was \u201chugely appreciative\u201d of self-supporting ministers \u201cwho work voluntarily for the church, many already with successful careers in the secular world\u201d.</p> <p>The C of E highlighted its own 2017 research findings, which showed that 80% of clergy were \u201cdoing all right\u201d or \u201cliving comfortably\u201d, adding: \u201cThe findings from this ongoing research, in particular the experiences of clergy who struggle financially, will inform a review of the clergy remuneration package by the Archbishops\u2019 Council, which is due to get under way shortly.\u201d</p> <p>The archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s stipend is set independently and Lambeth Palace also houses offices for staff and space for other groups, and welcomes visitors, the C of E added.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s not adding up\u2019</h2> <p>He is a familiar face on TV screens, fronting BBC documentaries exploring religious issues.</p> <p>But while many viewers will recognise the Rev Peter Owen-Jones, most will have no idea that he would not be able to continue in priesthood without charitable handouts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b11f542689e9380bb8b51fdd47654c371387a941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b11f542689e9380bb8b51fdd47654c371387a941/0_410_2628_3284/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Rev Peter Owen-Jones in his Firle parish.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rev Peter Owen-Jones in his Firle parish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Holden/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 61-year-old is a non-stipendiary vicar \u2013 serving the villages of Firle, Glynde and Beddingham in East Sussex \u2013 meaning he is not paid by the Church of England for his duties.</p> <p>Instead, Owen-Jones is reliant on a yearly charitable grant of up to \u00a33,000 and an \u201chonorarium\u201d from the diocese of \u00a3430 every quarter. \u201cI would not be able to continue as priest were it not for the support of the Clergy Support Trust,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI get a grant from them and I\u2019ve had a grant from them for the last three or four years. This is my choice. I love being a parish priest. I\u2019ve taken the moral decision to be a non-stipendiary priest because I think that just sits easier with me. I don\u2019t have an issue with priests not being paid. I have an issue with that system subsidising what appears to be an unchanged and an unchanging centre.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/fame-fortune/peter-owen-jones-priests-shouldnt-paid-broke-posed-naked-art/\">the former advertising executive revealed</a> that in his early days as a vicar supporting a young family, he had once been so broke he made money posing naked for an art class.</p> <p>In theory, Owen-Jones\u2019s unpaid role \u2013 which comes with a house in Firle \u2013 is part-time, but the reality is different and he questions the C of E\u2019s approach, describing its reliance on self-supporting ministers as \u201cmorally questionable\u201d given that they are often expected to perform full-time duties.</p> <p>Owen-Jones, who is divorced and has four adult children, said: \u201cWhen I tell people I\u2019m not paid they say: \u2018What?\u2019 This has been coming for 30 or 40 years. The more and more non-stipendiary priests, the greater the clamour will become.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is an increasing reliance on non-stipendiary vicars. How much of the church is being kept afloat by self-supporting ministry? Whether those ministers can continue to be treated as full-time ministers, that to me is morally questionable.\u201d</p> <p>In 2002 there were 2,091 self-supporting ministers, but that has now risen to 2,920 following a slight decline in recent years. Self-supporting ministers tend to be older, with an average age of 62.3 compared with 52.1 for stipend posts. Nearly a third (190) of vicars in training last year were preparing for non-stipendiary roles.</p> <p>Owen-Jones, who was a stipendiary priest earlier in his career, added: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that the church is increasingly relying on what they call \u2018self-supporting\u2019 ministers and \u2018house-for-duty\u2019 priests.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, non-stipendiary priests, self-supporting priests are subsidising that institution [the Church of England] as things currently stand.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment I believe it\u2019s been happening under the counter. We need to have a frank and open discussion about whether the church can afford to maintain its working apparatus or whether there needs to be root-and-branch reform, given the number of people that are going to church and given the expectations that are placed upon the church by the state. At the moment it\u2019s not adding up.\u201d </p>",

They need to get away but often they can\u2019t afford it if they have got families.\u201d He said they often struggled to cover everyday costs, such as fixing a broken washing machine or paying for new school uniforms. Many clergy had an \u201cinnate tendency not to come forward for help\u201d, Moodey added, also expressing concern for those who suffered relationship breakdown. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of: \u2018There are many in my congregation who are worse off than me. Why should I regard myself as a special case?\u2019\u201d In the case of the vicar who was forced to use a payday loan firm, Moodey said: \u201cHe is now working through a debt repayment plan with a debt advice charity which is a partner of ours, with some help from us to get that sorted.\u201d Welby has previously attacked payday lenders, but his criticism backfired when it emerged the C of E held an indirect investment in the now defunct Wonga. Moodey said: \u201cPayday lenders are causing significant suffering amongst the wider population and you would hope that clergy would be able to mirror what is the church\u2019s position which is that, actually, payday lenders are bad news. But if you\u2019re desperate and you really can\u2019t make ends meet, then desperate people do desperate things.\u201d Most vicars receive a stipend of up to \u00a327,886 plus housing but there are nearly 3,000 \u201cself-supporting\u201d ministers who are not paid, according to newly released C of E figures. The C of E\u2019s website lists a series of adverts for \u201chouse for duty\u201d roles, which are unpaid. The majority of vicars receiving grants from Clergy Support Trust are in stipend roles but some are in non-stipend roles. Since the start of 2018, 7% of non-retired clergy helped by the charity were \u201cself-supporting\u201d. While for non-stipendiary vicars \u2013 who tend to be older and getting pensions from other careers \u2013 not being paid is often a choice, some do struggle financially, especially those in retirement. Wilson said: \u201cMental health issues pose an increasing challenge, and I worry about retired non-stipendiary clergy and some clergy spouses who are in real difficulties. There is always more to be done, not only for individuals who are struggling, but in order to understand the underlying trends. Above all, it\u2019s important that people experiencing problems alert archdeacons and bishops to what is going on.\u201d A C of E spokeswoman said: \u201cWe take the wellbeing of our 20,000 clergy extremely seriously. We note with concern the cases highlighted by Clergy Support Trust and we are grateful for its support for clergy struggling financially, as well as for the work of the Churches\u2019 Mutual Credit Union, launched in 2015 with the backing of the Church of England. \u201cProblem debt is a widespread and serious issue in our society and it is worrying that a group of clergy is also affected.\u201d The C of E said it was \u201chugely appreciative\u201d of self-supporting ministers \u201cwho work voluntarily for the church, many already with successful careers in the secular world\u201d. The C of E highlighted its own 2017 research findings, which showed that 80% of clergy were \u201cdoing all right\u201d or \u201cliving comfortably\u201d, adding: \u201cThe findings from this ongoing research, in particular the experiences of clergy who struggle financially, will inform a review of the clergy remuneration package by the Archbishops\u2019 Council, which is due to get under way shortly.\u201d The archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s stipend is set independently and Lambeth Palace also houses offices for staff and space for other groups, and welcomes visitors, the C of E added. \u2018It\u2019s not adding up\u2019 He is a familiar face on TV screens, fronting BBC documentaries exploring religious issues. But while many viewers will recognise the Rev Peter Owen-Jones, most will have no idea that he would not be able to continue in priesthood without charitable handouts. The 61-year-old is a non-stipendiary vicar \u2013 serving the villages of Firle, Glynde and Beddingham in East Sussex \u2013 meaning he is not paid by the Church of England for his duties. Instead, Owen-Jones is reliant on a yearly charitable grant of up to \u00a33,000 and an \u201chonorarium\u201d from the diocese of \u00a3430 every quarter. \u201cI would not be able to continue as priest were it not for the support of the Clergy Support Trust,\u201d he said. \u201cI get a grant from them and I\u2019ve had a grant from them for the last three or four years. This is my choice. I love being a parish priest. I\u2019ve taken the moral decision to be a non-stipendiary priest because I think that just sits easier with me. I don\u2019t have an issue with priests not being paid. I have an issue with that system subsidising what appears to be an unchanged and an unchanging centre.\u201d Last month, the former advertising executive revealed that in his early days as a vicar supporting a young family, he had once been so broke he made money posing naked for an art class. In theory, Owen-Jones\u2019s unpaid role \u2013 which comes with a house in Firle \u2013 is part-time, but the reality is different and he questions the C of E\u2019s approach, describing its reliance on self-supporting ministers as \u201cmorally questionable\u201d given that they are often expected to perform full-time duties. Owen-Jones, who is divorced and has four adult children, said: \u201cWhen I tell people I\u2019m not paid they say: \u2018What?\u2019 This has been coming for 30 or 40 years. The more and more non-stipendiary priests, the greater the clamour will become. \u201cI think there is an increasing reliance on non-stipendiary vicars. How much of the church is being kept afloat by self-supporting ministry? Whether those ministers can continue to be treated as full-time ministers, that to me is morally questionable.\u201d In 2002 there were 2,091 self-supporting ministers, but that has now risen to 2,920 following a slight decline in recent years. Self-supporting ministers tend to be older, with an average age of 62.3 compared with 52.1 for stipend posts. Nearly a third (190) of vicars in training last year were preparing for non-stipendiary roles. Owen-Jones, who was a stipendiary priest earlier in his career, added: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that the church is increasingly relying on what they call \u2018self-supporting\u2019 ministers and \u2018house-for-duty\u2019 priests. \u201cEssentially, non-stipendiary priests, self-supporting priests are subsidising that institution [the Church of England] as things currently stand. \u201cAt the moment I believe it\u2019s been happening under the counter. We need to have a frank and open discussion about whether the church can afford to maintain its working apparatus or whether there needs to be root-and-branch reform, given the number of people that are going to church and given the expectations that are placed upon the church by the state. At the moment it\u2019s not adding up.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It has been quite a week for Boris Johnson, Brexit and politics more widely. So where are we now? And, more importantly, what happens next?</p> <h2>How did this week pan out?</h2> <p>It began with a cross-party group of backbench rebels threatening to seize control of the Commons timetable to push through a bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street warned that any Tory MPs backing the plan would be ejected from the party, and if it succeeded Johnson would call for a general election. On Tuesday, 21 Tories helped the timetabling motion pass, and were duly kicked out. The next day the bill passed the Commons and Johnson tried to call for an election but failed to reach the required two-thirds majority vote. By Thursday, with the bill going through the Lords, Johnson used a rambling speech in Yorkshire to pledge he would try again to push for an election. This was just after his own brother had quit the government. The week ended with opposition parties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/opposition-parties-agree-block-snap-election-until-brexit-delay-secured\">agreeing to again thwart </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/opposition-parties-agree-block-snap-election-until-brexit-delay-secured\">any snap election attempt</a>, and Johnson wrangling bulls in Scotland. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd39bff77e2fc613ad9595024a160d45281e2ec0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd39bff77e2fc613ad9595024a160d45281e2ec0/0_288_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson handles a bull during his visit to Darnford farm in Banchory, near Aberdeen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson handles a bull during his visit to Darnford farm in Banchory, near Aberdeen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Are we getting an election or not?</h2> <p>The brief answer is: probably yes, but not yet. Johnson is adamant that an election should happen before the crunch European council summit on 17 and 18 October, with 15 October being his preferred date. Labour and the Scottish National party initially seemed minded to support this, provided they could secure guarantees against government ruses to crash out of the EU on 31 October. But after much thought the combined opposition view is to only agree to an election once a Brexit delay has been definitively secured \u2013 meaning it would happen later in October or November. Johnson has been seeking an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which requires the backing of two-thirds of MPs, meaning it is in the opposition\u2019s gift. Other methods of forcing an election are possible, but have significant drawbacks.</p> <h2>Does that mean Brexit will not happen on 31 October?</h2> <p>It would seem not. The rebel bill, due to get royal assent on Monday, dictates that if by 19 October the government has neither passed a new deal or received MPs\u2019 consent for no deal, it must seek an extension to 31 January (longer if required by the EU and agreed by parliament). This will be the law.</p> <h2>Will Johnson extend Brexit?</h2> <p>The prime minister insists not, saying candidly that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-rather-be-dead-in-ditch-than-agree-brexit-extension\">he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d</a> than do so. However, he has also said he would follow the law. There is, obviously, a contradiction in this, and the way out remains unclear. One theory would involve Johnson resigning \u2013 No 10 has not explicitly ruled this out \u2013 and allowing opposition parties to try, and potentially struggle, to form a temporary government before an election. More unlikely proposals include someone other than Johnson being sent to Brussels to agree to the extension, with options including the Speaker, John Bercow, or even the Queen.</p> <h2>What is Downing Street\u2019s plan?</h2> <p>For now, it seems to be the venerable political tradition of ploughing on day by day in the hope something turns up. Publicly, officials will not look beyond Monday\u2019s second attempt to spark an election, and the associated media blitz aimed at labelling Jeremy Corbyn a coward, complete with mocked-up chicken pictures. It is entirely plausible that they still do not know quite what to do if compelled to seek a new Brexit deadline.</p> <h2>What\u2019s happening next week?</h2> <p>Beyond the planned vote about an election on Monday, the timetable is opaque. The controversial suspension of parliament for five weeks is due to begin at any point up to Thursday, but can be decided on day by day.

      "bodyText": "It has been quite a week for Boris Johnson, Brexit and politics more widely. So where are we now? And, more importantly, what happens next? How did this week pan out? It began with a cross-party group of backbench rebels threatening to seize control of the Commons timetable to push through a bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street warned that any Tory MPs backing the plan would be ejected from the party, and if it succeeded Johnson would call for a general election. On Tuesday, 21 Tories helped the timetabling motion pass, and were duly kicked out. The next day the bill passed the Commons and Johnson tried to call for an election but failed to reach the required two-thirds majority vote. By Thursday, with the bill going through the Lords, Johnson used a rambling speech in Yorkshire to pledge he would try again to push for an election. This was just after his own brother had quit the government. The week ended with opposition parties agreeing to again thwart any snap election attempt, and Johnson wrangling bulls in Scotland. Are we getting an election or not? The brief answer is: probably yes, but not yet. Johnson is adamant that an election should happen before the crunch European council summit on 17 and 18 October, with 15 October being his preferred date. Labour and the Scottish National party initially seemed minded to support this, provided they could secure guarantees against government ruses to crash out of the EU on 31 October. But after much thought the combined opposition view is to only agree to an election once a Brexit delay has been definitively secured \u2013 meaning it would happen later in October or November. Johnson has been seeking an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which requires the backing of two-thirds of MPs, meaning it is in the opposition\u2019s gift. Other methods of forcing an election are possible, but have significant drawbacks. Does that mean Brexit will not happen on 31 October? It would seem not. The rebel bill, due to get royal assent on Monday, dictates that if by 19 October the government has neither passed a new deal or received MPs\u2019 consent for no deal, it must seek an extension to 31 January (longer if required by the EU and agreed by parliament). This will be the law. Will Johnson extend Brexit? The prime minister insists not, saying candidly that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than do so. However, he has also said he would follow the law. There is, obviously, a contradiction in this, and the way out remains unclear. One theory would involve Johnson resigning \u2013 No 10 has not explicitly ruled this out \u2013 and allowing opposition parties to try, and potentially struggle, to form a temporary government before an election. More unlikely proposals include someone other than Johnson being sent to Brussels to agree to the extension, with options including the Speaker, John Bercow, or even the Queen. What is Downing Street\u2019s plan? For now, it seems to be the venerable political tradition of ploughing on day by day in the hope something turns up. Publicly, officials will not look beyond Monday\u2019s second attempt to spark an election, and the associated media blitz aimed at labelling Jeremy Corbyn a coward, complete with mocked-up chicken pictures. It is entirely plausible that they still do not know quite what to do if compelled to seek a new Brexit deadline. What\u2019s happening next week? Beyond the planned vote about an election on Monday, the timetable is opaque. The controversial suspension of parliament for five weeks is due to begin at any point up to Thursday, but can be decided on day by day. MPs will be buying open return rail tickets. Has this been a bad week for Johnson? With the important caveat that many voters pay little attention to cries of \u201cChaos!\u201d from SW1, it\u2019s not been great. The culling of 21 generally loyal and some very senior MPs has gone down badly with a fair section of the parliamentary Conservative party, who view it as another sign of the malign influence of Johnson\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings. Johnson has also now lost every Commons vote as prime minister, had his own brother, Jo, leave government, and delivered one of the more rambling and chaotic speeches in recent UK politics, which infuriated police for being a nakedly partisan address against a backdrop of uniformed officers. On the same day, one of his ministers, Jacob Rees-Mogg, angered doctors for comparing a senior medic who raised worries about no deal to a disgraced anti-vaxxer. Both groups are influential and, more importantly, generally seen by voters in a much more favourable light than politicians.",

Because there\u2019s absolutely no doubt we should come out \u2026 It\u2019s a pointless delay.\u201d Johnson, who gave hesitant and incomplete answers to questions about the crisis at Westminster, was pressed by reporters on whether he would ignore a legal requirement to ask for a delay. He cut short one part of his answer and said he did not want such a delay. \u201cI will not ex\u2026 I don\u2019t want a delay,\u201d he said. The prime minister was in Aberdeenshire to announce more than \u00a350m in extra funding for Scottish farming following a government review of agricultural support, and another \u00a3160m in backdated funding. He had earlier met fishing industry leaders at Peterhead fish market on Friday morning, and is later on Friday due to meet about 100 Conservative party members in West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, the seat held by the Tory MP Andrew Bowie. Johnson was asked twice whether he would sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, after the former prime minister Sir John Major described him as a \u201cpoison\u201d at the heart of government on Thursday night. Johnson did not answer the first question on his adviser\u2019s future but pressed a second time refused to give Cummings his unambiguous support. He answered: \u201cLook\u2026 advisers, as I think someone said in the Commons the other day, advisers advise and ministers decide.\u201d He was also asked about his own future after a tumultuous week during which he suspended 21 Tory MPs, including the former chancellor Ken Clarke, his younger brother Jo Johnson stepped down from the government and as an MP, and other senior Tories announced their retirement. His brother cited irreconcilable conflicts between his family and the national interest. Asked about his failure to uphold his pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to unite the party, Johnson said he had promised to \u201cdeliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Asked again when he would resign, he said: \u201cEr \u2026 Well \u2026 I think after those three objectives have been accomplished I will \u2026 At some point after those three objectives have been accomplished.\u201d He said he was \u201cperplexed\u201d that neither Jeremy Corbyn or the SNP would agree to a snap election on his timetable. \u201cI have never known an opposition in the history of democracy that has refused to have an election,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they obviously don\u2019t trust the people. They don\u2019t think that the people will vote for them, so they\u2019re refusing to have an election. So what we will do is we will go to the summit on the 17th. We will get a deal and go out from 31 October.\u201d He did not deny the SNP could win more Westminster seats in a snap election but ruled out giving Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, the legal powers to stage a fresh independence referendum which she plans to ask for before Christmas. \u201cPeople were told in 2014 that the referendum was a once in a generation event. I don\u2019t see why they should go back on it,\u201d he said. Johnson is due to stay with the Queen at Balmoral on Friday night with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in line with a tradition for prime ministers during annual summer break there. The Mail on Sunday reported last month that Symonds and Johnson would share a room, despite a long-standing convention where unmarried couples are barred from doing so.",

      "body": "<p>If this summer\u2019s spats in theatreland have taught us anything, it\u2019s that producers should pause whenever they itch to answer controversy. First came the mansplaining team behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/02/writers-claim-being-excluded-after-creating-idris-elbas-play\">Idris Elba\u2019s Tree \u2013 initially at the Manchester international festival</a> \u2013 with its disputed authorship. Then <a href=\"https://www.selladoor.com/shows/whats-on/falsettos/news/update-final-casting-announced-for-falsettos-at-the-other-palace\">Selladoor, producing the musical Falsettos</a>, leapt into aggressive-defensive mode when a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/23/jewface-row-west-end-musical-falsettos-decried-for-cultural-appropriation\">Jewish theatremakers, in an open letter</a>, claimed the show apparently lacked any Jewish voices among the cast and creative team. For good measure, the production\u2019s \u201ccultural consultant\u201d tweeted about actors sporting yellow stars on their sleeves. None of this was a good look.</p> <p>Why the controversy? Falsettos, by the US composer William Finn, is undeniably a Jewish story. Most of its characters are Jewish, and the last scene portrays an unconventional barmitzvah. Its irresistible opening number is Four Jews in a Room Bitching (\u201cI\u2019m neurotic, he\u2019s neurotic, they\u2019re neurotic, we\u2019re neurotic\u201d). There are scraps of Yiddish, squabbles about catering, angst for days. You can understand the argument that, without Jewish voices in the room, the musical will lack the savour and authenticity of lived experience \u2013 that everything will feel slightly awry, like the story\u2019s \u201cshiksa caterer\u201d who can\u2019t pronounce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/as-jews-prepare-for-passover-glasgow-sees-its-numbers-dwindle\">gefilte fish</a>.</p> <p>And yet, Falsettos, which opened in London last month, is also a milestone gay musical. Theatre scholar <a href=\"https://divamag.co.uk/2019/08/23/the-lesbians-from-next-door-celebrating-community-and-friendship-in-falsettos/\">Emily Garside</a> has explored the show\u2019s place in modern theatre history, placing gay men \u2013 and their female, often lesbian allies \u2013 centre stage. The first section was written in 1979, as gay liberation spun the glitterball in New York, and a man like Marvin might be emboldened to leave his wife for a male lover. The last act, premiered in 1990, pushes forward into cruelly changing times, as the Aids epidemic takes hold. Events turn musical comedy into something approaching musical tragedy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb18c09be55392577afb13a3f0f4732d34ec9ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb18c09be55392577afb13a3f0f4732d34ec9ed2/0_0_4034_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Approaching musical tragedy \u2026 Natasha J Barnes, Gemma Knight-Jones and Laura Pitt-Pulford in Falsettos at the Other Palace, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Approaching musical tragedy \u2026 Natasha J Barnes, Gemma Knight-Jones and Laura Pitt-Pulford in Falsettos at the Other Palace, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Questions about identity pervade the piece \u2013 about finding your truth, then trying to live it. In the first act, everyone struggles through their meshugganah<em> </em>emotions \u2013 the husband who leaves his wife for a man, but enters an equally unsettled dynamic; the lover coddled yet constrained by commitment; the wife left wondering what her marriage really meant, then starting a new relationship; the child bewildered by his parents\u2019 choices; the shrink who treats them all then marries mom. (It\u2019s very Manhattan.)</p> <p>In the second act, the characters settle into their choices, even as time comes for them: Reagan and Aids arrive in sync. It\u2019s a brilliantly witty show \u2013 every line a paper cut \u2013 and the register is quintessentially New York: fitfully campy and achingly sincere. These are hyper-articulate, emotionally conflicted, painfully self-aware characters \u2013 even pre-teen Jason can sing, \u201cI\u2019m too smart for my own good, / And I\u2019m too good for my sorry little life.\u201d Of course, weighing identities \u2013 ethnic, sexual, gender \u2013 against each other isn\u2019t helpful. The musical swims in that merry mess.</p> <p>The production at<a href=\"https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/the-other-palace/\"> the Other Palace</a> could use more flair. But could it be more Jewish?

      "bodyText": "If this summer\u2019s spats in theatreland have taught us anything, it\u2019s that producers should pause whenever they itch to answer controversy. First came the mansplaining team behind Idris Elba\u2019s Tree \u2013 initially at the Manchester international festival \u2013 with its disputed authorship. Then Selladoor, producing the musical Falsettos, leapt into aggressive-defensive mode when a group of Jewish theatremakers, in an open letter, claimed the show apparently lacked any Jewish voices among the cast and creative team. For good measure, the production\u2019s \u201ccultural consultant\u201d tweeted about actors sporting yellow stars on their sleeves. None of this was a good look. Why the controversy? Falsettos, by the US composer William Finn, is undeniably a Jewish story. Most of its characters are Jewish, and the last scene portrays an unconventional barmitzvah. Its irresistible opening number is Four Jews in a Room Bitching (\u201cI\u2019m neurotic, he\u2019s neurotic, they\u2019re neurotic, we\u2019re neurotic\u201d). There are scraps of Yiddish, squabbles about catering, angst for days. You can understand the argument that, without Jewish voices in the room, the musical will lack the savour and authenticity of lived experience \u2013 that everything will feel slightly awry, like the story\u2019s \u201cshiksa caterer\u201d who can\u2019t pronounce gefilte fish. And yet, Falsettos, which opened in London last month, is also a milestone gay musical. Theatre scholar Emily Garside has explored the show\u2019s place in modern theatre history, placing gay men \u2013 and their female, often lesbian allies \u2013 centre stage. The first section was written in 1979, as gay liberation spun the glitterball in New York, and a man like Marvin might be emboldened to leave his wife for a male lover. The last act, premiered in 1990, pushes forward into cruelly changing times, as the Aids epidemic takes hold. Events turn musical comedy into something approaching musical tragedy. Questions about identity pervade the piece \u2013 about finding your truth, then trying to live it. In the first act, everyone struggles through their meshugganah emotions \u2013 the husband who leaves his wife for a man, but enters an equally unsettled dynamic; the lover coddled yet constrained by commitment; the wife left wondering what her marriage really meant, then starting a new relationship; the child bewildered by his parents\u2019 choices; the shrink who treats them all then marries mom. (It\u2019s very Manhattan.) In the second act, the characters settle into their choices, even as time comes for them: Reagan and Aids arrive in sync. It\u2019s a brilliantly witty show \u2013 every line a paper cut \u2013 and the register is quintessentially New York: fitfully campy and achingly sincere. These are hyper-articulate, emotionally conflicted, painfully self-aware characters \u2013 even pre-teen Jason can sing, \u201cI\u2019m too smart for my own good, / And I\u2019m too good for my sorry little life.\u201d Of course, weighing identities \u2013 ethnic, sexual, gender \u2013 against each other isn\u2019t helpful. The musical swims in that merry mess. The production at the Other Palace could use more flair. But could it be more Jewish? What would that even mean? After the Guardian\u2019s report on Falsettogate, the actor David Djemal wrote in a letter to the paper: \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between being in on the joke, or the joke being on you.\u201d Beautifully put, but I wonder how that distinction plays in practice. Finn\u2019s characters live a very different Jewish life from the one their parents would have experienced \u2013 overwhelmingly secular, pursuing sex and self-fulfilment, returning to ritual with wavering conviction. As Adam Lenson, one of the authors of the open letter published in the Stage and a theatre director, has been at pains to point out, this isn\u2019t principally about casting (though the letter\u2019s list of high-profile, non-Jewish actors in Jewish roles was distracting). And it\u2019s unfair to focus on actors, who can only work with the roles in which they\u2019re cast. However slow-footed and surly Selladoor\u2019s public responses, its terrific cast doesn\u2019t deserve any flak. Gay people and Jews can both \u201cpass\u201d, to use the throwback term. Artists who want to swivel around these identities can often do so, but that means that Jewish experience has too easily been ignored in British theatre, even when integral to the material.

      "bodyText": "Remember that Goldilocks report that we talked about earlier? The non-farm payrolls numbers appear to have delivered pretty much that. Not too hot, not too cold. Donald Trump, the US president, had an early dig at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, shortly before the jobs numbers came through, but moved on quickly to watching Fox News, if his Twitter feed is to be believed. While clearly below expectations, the 130,000 jobs added by the US economy in August was not too far below the 158,000 consensus \u2013 and doesn\u2019t add to recession warning lights. There has been a clear slowdown in the jobs market, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. But it wasn\u2019t too bad, he added: Aside from the headline payroll numbers, the rest of the employment report was actually quite positive. That positive news means the Fed is still overwhelmingly likely to cut interest rates by no more than 25bp later this month. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there are signs that \u201cprolonged and deep uncertainty\u201d over the trade war was denting investment plans. However, today\u2019s numbers could put off Powell\u2019s stand-off with markets looking for renewed stimulus. Most economists think the trade war will eventually make its market on the jobs market (ahead of an election year), but it may not be quite there yet. Thanks for following our coverage of economics, business and markets today. Please do join Graeme Wearden on Monday for more. JJ The jobs growth was the weakest in three months, despite a boost from the hiring of temporary workers for the 2020 Census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The 130,000 reading was below the average for the year so far, as the US economy comes to terms with slowing growth. Economists expect Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China to weigh on growth further. Job growth has averaged 158,000 per month thus far this year, below the average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018. Investors have tempered their slight mood of optimism from earlier. Gold prices have recovered some of their losses after the weaker than expected print: spot prices are down by 0.2%. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury has fallen back to 1.57%, but remains within today\u2019s trading range. The dollar similarly pared some earlier gains. Donald Trump, the US president, already has his thoughts on monetary policy \u2013 getting his jibes in early just ahead of the payrolls data. Some more detail on the jobs numbers: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down its reading for new jobs added in July from 164,000 to 159,000. The unemployment rate was 3.7% in August, unchanged from July and in line with consensus, but the participation rate rose marginally to 63.2% from 63.0% in July. Private-sector jobs fell by 35,000, while government jobs increased slightly. The US economy added 130,000 jobs, lower than the 158,000 predicted by economists. The FTSE 100 is slightly down, by less than 0.1%, while sterling has slightly moderated some of its earlier losses: it\u2019s now down by 0.2% against the dollar and the euro. The dollar index, which tracks a trade-weighted basket of currencies, is essentially flat ahead of non-farms, while the US 10-year Treasury bond yield has reached a day high of 1.604%, the highest since 23 August. Powell is odds-on to loosen monetary policy, according to data from CME Group. Investors\u2019 market bets imply a probability of more than 90% that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) at its next meeting on 18 September. But investors\u2019 eyes are on the pace of change over the next few months. Markets are currently pricing at least two cuts by the end of this year. Manufacturing data have been weak in the US recently, but jobs numbers from private payrolls provider ADP were relatively strong, giving economists a mixed picture of where the US economy may be heading. Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at forex firm FXTM, said: The non-farm payroll report for August is projected to show an increase of 160k jobs created and the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7%. Should the US jobs report meet or exceed market forecasts, this should cool speculation over deep Fed rate cuts, ultimately supporting the dollar. And now let\u2019s have a look ahead to the US jobs numbers, due shortly. The headline non-farm payrolls number is expected to fall, from 164,000 in July to 158,000 for August, if economists\u2019 average forecasts are to be believed. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will be hoping for a Goldilocks non-farm payrolls number: too high and it could trigger a market adjustment in expectation of a delay to any stimulus; too low and it could undo the fragile optimism about the US economy. Powell has come under massive pressure from Donald Trump, the US president, who has called repeatedly for interest rate cuts to support growth. Powell, for his part, has said that the president\u2019s trade war with China is one of the major risks to the global economy. Wetherspoons\u2019 boss Tim Martin has pledged to slash the price of lagers, spirits, wine and cider if the UK leaves the EU, after shaving 20p off a pint of ale to illustrate the Brexit benefits he expects for drinkers. Martin has been one of the most vociferously pro-Brexit figures in the world of business, repeatedly insisting that leaving the European Union, even without a deal, will mean cheaper prices for customers. Wetherspoons has cut the price of Ruddles, an ale made by Greene King, by an average of 20p across its 900 pubs. Although Ruddles is made in the UK Martin said a low-tariff regime would cut overall costs for Wetherspoons, which it could then pass on to drinkers. Could Boris Johnson\u2019s hoped-for election spell the end of bank bonuses? John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, has threatened to ban the payouts to bankers, in an interview with the Financial Times (\u00a3). He said banks should scrap large bonuses voluntarily or face a potential ban. If it continues and the City hasn\u2019t learnt its lesson, we will take action, I\u2019ll give them that warning now. If we have to take action, we will. People are offended by bonuses. US stock market futures have gained ahead of the jobs report. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index have gained 0.37%, Dow Jones industrial average futures have gained 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures are up by 0.3%. Whether that mood of mild optimism holds will depend in large part on the non-farm payrolls number. The news yesterday that the US and China will resume trade talks next month \u2013 coupled with a relatively strong private-sector estimate of jobs growth \u2013 have given investors a bit of appetite for riskier assets as we head towards the non-farm payrolls data. Precious metals have taken a bit of a hammering today, with gold prices down by 0.9%. Gold is generally considered a safe haven investment by investors, so prices fall when investors are feeling more confident about the outlook. Silver prices also fell, by 2.5%, while platinum spot prices slumped by 2.7%, in part because of concerns of oversupply. US government bond yields have also risen, as investors have moved their money elsewhere. Bonds yields rise as prices fall due to lower demand for the safe-haven assets. The US 10-year yield hit 1.6% on Friday, its highest level since 23 August, when an announcement of higher tariffs on China by Donald Trump, the US president caused a rush for safety. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks is legal, the high court in London has ruled. In a judgment handed down by three of the most senior judges in England and Wales, the prime minister was found to have acted lawfully in the advice he gave to the Queen to suspend parliament from next week, writes Owen Bowcott. The ruling will go to appeal at the supreme court, which has already announced it is prepared to hear any appeals on 17 September. You can read the full story here: A fun fact from Reuters\u2019 UK economics correspondent, Andy Bruce: more Britons than ever before have no idea what is going on with monetary policy. As he notes, the public should probably be forgiven this time. Even Bank of England governor Mark Carney himself would be hard-pushed to predict what is going to happen with Brexit \u2013 or whether it will have even happened by the time he leaves on 31 January. If there is a no-deal Brexit the Bank could repeat its shock-and-awe rate cut and quantitative easing \u2013 but the Bank\u2019s ratesetters have strenuously tried to persuade markets that rates could go either way. We know that there is a world of difference between the economies of London and some of the UK\u2019s other regions. Some really interesting data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) put some numbers on the diverging fortunes of people in the capital and elsewhere. London\u2019s economy has outstripped all other English regions with a 19% surge in growth since 2012, according to data compiled from VAT returns from businesses, rather than the usual surveys used to measure economic growth. The ONS underlined the city\u2019s disproportionate economic heft in its first set of regional GDP figures for England and Wales, which showed the north-east with the slowest growth over the same period at 5.9%. This map, showing regional GDP growth across the UK since 2012, should really be one of the defining images of the post-crisis period. But there are some real surprises as well: London\u2019s financial services sector has been in recession since the third quarter of 2017 (to the end of 2018). You can read Phillip Inman\u2019s full story here: Even the world\u2019s second-largest economy needs some help from time to time. As a trade war with the US dents growth, and with fears of a recession rising in countries including Germany and the UK, China is stimulating its economy. China\u2019s central bank has announced another round of stimulus today: the People\u2019s Bank of China has cut the amount of money banks have to hold against their loans, in an effort to make them lend more. It\u2019s the seventh cut since early 2018, Reuters reports: China\u2019s central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the third time this year, releasing a total of 900 billion yuan (\u00a3102bn) in liquidity to shore up the slowing economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points (bps) for all banks, with an additional cut of 100 bps for some qualified banks. The broad-based cut will be effective 16 September. The additional targeted cut will be in two phases, effective 15 October and 15 November. The FTSE 100 has turned positive for today: it\u2019s now up by 0.15%. Reuters is crediting the weaker pound (although it remains little changed from earlier today \u2013 still around the $1.23 mark against the US dollar). A rare chart-topping position for packaging maker Smurfit Kappa. Note Berkeley Group\u2019s relatively strong performance that has pulled fellow housebuilder Barratt up the charts. Eurozone growth came in unchanged on its third estimate: 0.2% growth in the second quarter of the year. A minor beat on the headline year-on-year growth rate, remaining at 1.2% against 1.1% expectations, but otherwise no shocks. The country-by-country breakdown tells a tale: the UK economy was the worst performer in the EU during the second quarter (although Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland data were not available); Germany was the worst in the eurozone. Labour has confirmed that it will not vote for an election on Monday even if a bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit passes before then. The decision is a blow to Boris Johnson, who had asked for an election after parliament took control of the order paper and he lost his parliamentary majority; MPs are pushing through a bill that will prevent a no-deal exit. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry laid out Labour\u2019s reasoning this morning to the BBC, reports Andrew Sparrow: If we vote to have a general election, then no matter what it is that Boris Johnson promises, it is up to him to advise the Queen when the general election should be. And given that he has shown himself to be a manifest liar, and someone who has said that he will die in a ditch rather than stop no deal, and indeed his adviser, [Dominic] Cummings, has been swearing and shouting at MPs saying they are leaving on 31 [October] no matter what, our first priority has to be that we must stop no deal and we must make sure that that is going to happen. Johnson has also faced criticism over his decision to use a backdrop of police officers for a speech yesterday. The bizarre event will likely be remembered for some time, after a rambling delivery from the prime minister and an officer sitting down when feeling faint. The politics live blog is up and running for what promises to be another eventful day. Industrial production would have to increase by a total of more than 2.5% in the coming two months just to return to the level of the second quarter, according to Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. Not impossible but currently very unlikely. It is a marked turnaround from last year, when manufacturers were facing the only problem they like to have: Who still remembers last summer when the biggest problem for the German economy was supply-side constraints? The lack of demand has now become one of the most pressing issues. Things could get worse if the hot summer continues to drag down water levels on the Rhine river. It may sound like an oddly antediluvian economic indicator, but a shallower river means some stretches of the river become impassable, forcing companies to ship goods on land. At least in the short run, the prospects for German industry remain bleak. Even with a magnifying glass, it is impossible to find signals of an imminent rebound. Shrinking order books, high inventories and continuing external uncertainty do not bode well for the coming months. Let\u2019s get a bit more on the main development so far this morning: that drop in German industrial production. The signs are not good for the German economy, according to Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said: The July industrial production headline combined with the dreadful retail sales number now send a convincing signal that the German economy is in recession. The August and September numbers could still spring upside surprises, but we don\u2019t have high hopes. As noted earlier, Germany\u2019s exporters (think the makers of cars, lifts, trains, etc.) are exposed to global uncertainty over trade. And the long recovery since the financial crisis is reaching an age that makes economists nervous. A question in the comments from Peuplier (channeling the Queen): why did economists not see the German production fall coming, after a string of poor numbers? While there of course may be some issue with the models used by the economists, it could also be a function of there being a bit of a lag on the forecasts. Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics notes that economists\u2019 actual expectations for the reading may have been downgraded after poor factory orders data published yesterday. And the previous month\u2019s number received a notable mark-up (even if it was still a big drop) so the forecast miss could be a case of getting the profile of the slump wrong, rather than the absolute size. A sterling update: after a dramatic week of Brexit news, so far today the pound has started the day on a more even footing. Against the US dollar the pound is down by 0.2% today, but remains just above the $1.23 mark reached yesterday. It is struggling a bit more against the euro, with the pound down by 0.3%, just above \u20ac1.11. That was the first time that sterling had jumped above $1.23 in five weeks, in the early days of Boris Johnson\u2019s ascent to prime minister. The only real question in town for sterling\u2019s medium-term prospects is whether the UK will exit the EU on 31 October without a deal. A no-deal Brexit would almost certainly see sterling plunge, given the overwhelming consensus among economists that disruption to trade would weaken the British economy. That $1.23 mark represented quite a rebound from earlier in the week, when it briefly dipped below $1.20 on fears that Johnson really could push through a chaotic exit. When parliament took control investors welcomed a perceived diminished risk of no deal. You can read more from last night by yours truly here: House prices across Britain held steady in August, as the continued strength of employment numbers and a lack of supply made up for the Brexit chaos. House prices rose by 0.3% month-on-month to an average of \u00a3233,541, according to figures published by Halifax, the bank. Over the last year Halifax\u2019s data show UK house prices rose by 1.8% \u2013 markedly lower than the 3.4% expected by economists. Prices have barely changed since March, according to Russell Galley, Halifax\u2019s managing director. He said: While ongoing economic uncertainty continues to weigh on consumer sentiment \u2013 with evidence of both buyers and sellers exercising some caution \u2013 a number of important underlying factors such as affordability and employment remain strong. Although the housing market will undoubtedly be influenced by events in the wider economy, it continues to show a degree of resilience for the time being. We should also not lose sight of the fact that the single biggest driver of both prices and activity over the longer-term remains the dearth of available properties to meet demand from buyers. We\u2019ve got two posts in without a mention of Brexit. That brief hiatus is now over. However, it\u2019s something of a break from the rest of the week\u2019s chaos (much more detail to come on that later), with housebuilder Berkeley Group saying it sees a strong market in London and the south-east of England even with Brexit concerns reaching an even higher pitch. But the company projected pre-tax profit in each of the next six years to be lower than last year and said it was looking at ways to limit a hit from a potentially disruptive Brexit, Reuters reported. The company set a pretax profit target of \u00a33.3bn over the six years to April 2025, with profit in any one year expected to be between \u00a3500m and \u00a3700m. It posted pretax profit of \u00a3775m in its latest financial year ended 30 April. The group holds its annual meeting today \u2013 keep on eye on investors\u2019 reaction to boss Tony Pidgeley\u2019s pay. Berkeley capped the amount bosses could earn through their lucrative bonus scheme in 2017, after years of bumper payouts in line with big profits. Berkeley has been a recipient of the government\u2019s help-to-buy subsidy throughout much of the last decade. The FTSE 100 has fallen back in early trading, down 0.25%, despite a slightly lower pound (usually a boost to the blue-chip index\u2019s multinationals). It\u2019s fairly flat otherwise on European stock markets. Germany\u2019s Dax rose by 0.2%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 was flat. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Economists think that storm clouds are gathering across the global economy, and few indicators have been flashing as constantly as those tracking German industry. The latest figures from Destatis, published this morning, show a 0.6% month-on-month decline for July, compared to economists\u2019 average expectations of a rise of 0.4%. That represented a further decline from the steep fall of 1.1% (revised up) in the previous month \u2013 although the weakness was somewhat anticipated by factory orders data yesterday. In the second quarter of 2019 output shrank by 1.8%, as uncertainty around the US-China trade war and a global slowdown in demand for cars weighed on production. Germany\u2019s industry has now shrunk in six of the last 12 months, according to the Destatis data. The industrial recession is continuing in the third quarter and looks set to drag on beyond that, according to Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics. He said: There is still no sign in the latest surveys that the manufacturing recession is bottoming out. The average reading of the manufacturing PMI in July and August was very low (just over 43) while the Ifo business climate for August fell to its lowest level since November 2012. The figures will be further food for thought for Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. She is in Beijing today, with dinner with Chinese president Xi Jinping scheduled for this evening. It is a sensitive moment, amidst a full-blown trade war between the US and China. Donald Trump, the US president, has also threatened to turn his eye towards Germany\u2019s large trade surplus. \u201cWe hope that there will be a solution in the trade dispute with the United States since it affects everybody\u201d in the world, Merkel told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People during a two-day trip to China, according to Reuters. One important factor in the trade war (potentially both a cause and a consequence) is the health of the US economy. We\u2019ll get a vital health check later today, at 1:30pm BST, as the closely followed US non-farm payrolls jobs report come out. Economists expect the US economy added 158,000 jobs during August, down from July. Keep a lookout for Trump tweeting in the aftermath \u2013 and pity Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who has to talk in public this evening. Powell has come under extraordinary pressure from Trump to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. If the figures miss expectations then a repeat of Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech \u2013 when Trump blew the Fed\u2019s careful planning out of the water \u2013 might be on the cards. The agenda 8:30am BST: UK Halifax house price index (August) 10am BST: Eurozone GDP growth third estimate (second quarter) 11:30am: Russia central bank interest rate decision 1:30pm: Canada unemployment (August) 1:30pm: US non-farm payrolls jobs report (August) 5:30pm: US Federal Reserve speech by Jerome Powell",

However, there have been some product launches lately, such as <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/05/scotch-company-launches-light-whisky-at-21-5-abv/\" title=\"\">Whyte &amp; Mackay\u2019s </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/05/scotch-company-launches-light-whisky-at-21-5-abv/\" title=\"\">Light</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spiritofbermondsey.com/trinity-25-spirit-of-bermondsey-andrew-king-photography-190329-121937a/\" title=\"\">Trinity 25</a></strong>, that offer a more moderate version of full-strength spirits.</p> <p>To be honest, I\u2019m not totally convinced. You can, after all, easily dilute a full-strength drink or make it a single measure rather than a double, while still enjoying the full flavour of the original. Gin and tonic, whisky and soda and rum and Coke are still popular long drinks.</p> <p>There is, of course, the financial pay-off. A 21% whisky-like spirit (you can\u2019t call it whisky if it\u2019s under 40%) attracts half the tax of a 40% one, but if you have to drink twice as much of it to enjoy the full taste, there doesn\u2019t seem much point. Unlike alcohol-free \u201cspirits\u201d, you\u2019re still drinking alcohol, after all.</p> <p>And not all of these lower alcohol products are cheap. Trinity 25 (25%), for example, is a perfectly nice gin-type product with an attractively spicy hit, but at \u00a331.99, it\u2019s a good deal more than full-strength 40% <strong>Opihr</strong> (\u00a323.99 <a href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/product/gin/opihr-oriental-spiced-london-dry-gin/910002441911\" title=\"\">Asda</a>, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/opihr-oriental-spiced-london-gin/639885-298599-298600\" title=\"\">Waitrose</a>), which has a similarly peppery character. And they recommend you dilute it 50/50 with tonic water instead of the more normal one to three or four, tempting you to pour more.</p> <p>The other problem I have is that these are not products that are naturally low \u2013 or lowish \u2013 in alcohol, such as vermouth and sherry. Staples of the 1970s drinks cupboard, such as Cinzano, Martini and Dubonnet, were typically drunk long with soda or bitter lemon, rather than made into even more alcoholic cocktails.</p> <p>There are also lower-alcohol versions of brandies, which are not a pale imitation of the full-strength drink but a derivation of it \u2013 for instance, pineau de charentes from the cognac region; and pommeau, a mixture of apple juice and calvados. They\u2019re quite sweet, which goes against the trend for drier aperitifs, yet actually rather delicious and keep your overall alcohol intake down.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the almost-alcohol-free products (most list a token 0.05%) keep on coming: my new favourite is <strong>Atopia Citrus </strong>(\u00a324 <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/atopia-spiced-citrus-ultra-low-alcohol-spirit-70cl\" title=\"\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a>, \u00a325 <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/atopia-spiced-citrus-ultra-low-alcohol-spirit-473256011\" title=\"\">Ocado</a>), which is, interestingly, made by giant distiller William Grant. Its expertise shows in a really sophisticated bitter orange flavour.

      "bodyText": "A sports bookshop in Newcastle upon Tyne has announced that it will not stock Michael Owen\u2019s new memoir Reboot, after early extracts revealed the footballer\u2019s reluctance to move from Real Madrid to Newcastle United in 2005, writing: \u201cI don\u2019t need to justify myself to fucking Newcastle fans.\u201d Newcastle-based The Back Page, which describes itself as the largest stockist of sports books in the world, said that Reboot is \u201cthe first book we have ever totally refused to stock\u201d. Published on Friday, Reboot has been serialised this week in the Mirror, with Owen airing his feelings about his move to Newcastle 14 years ago for a club record \u00a316.8m and a salary of \u00a3120,000 a week. \u201cFrom a career perspective, there was no doubt in my mind that a move to the North East was a downward step. As unpalatable as that opinion might be to Newcastle fans, that\u2019s more or less what I felt,\u201d writes Owen. Initially, he says, Newcastle\u2019s \u201cpassionate fan base started counter-balancing my earlier reservations\u201d. But when he was knocked out in a game against Watford, his relationship with them was \u201cdamaged beyond repair\u201d. \u201cWhen I got home, I switched on Match of the Day to watch the game and I could hear Newcastle fans, my fans, singing \u2018What a waste of money!\u2019 as I\u2019m being stretchered off,\u201d he writes. \u201cI can\u2019t deny their actions that day changed things for me. No longer was I even going to attempt to ingratiate myself with the fans. Instead, I flipped it in a slightly more resentful way.\u201d Owen has not only provoked the ire of Newcastle booksellers. Alan Shearer, who was briefly Newcastle\u2019s manager while Owen was at the club, has responded on Twitter to Owen\u2019s claims in Reboot about their \u201cfeud\u201d. Owen, who is set to appear at signings in Chester and Liverpool over the weekend, subsequently said he is also positive in the book about Newcastle: \u201cI actually praise the people and the city. I bought a house and lived there for four years despite the myths that I flew home every two minutes.\u201d Responding to The Back Page\u2019s decision, Paul Dove, executive editor at Owen\u2019s publisher Reach Sport, said: \u201cMichael is keen for fans to read his book so they can fully understand the complete story of his life and career, including his time at Newcastle. The general response from booksellers has been fantastic.\u201d",

Since they were first measured in 1880, the southern peak has been the higher. But when Ninis Rosqvist and her team took this year\u2019s measurements, at the end of the summer melt on 3 September, the northern peak was 1.2 metres higher at 2,096.8 metres. \u201cWe suspected this was probably the case last year,\u201d Ninis Rosqvist told the Guardian from the Tarfala research station at the foot of the massif. \u201cBut unfortunately our measurements were not precise enough. Now we can say with certainty: we are accurate to within a couple of centimetres.\u201d The scientist said the height of Kebnekaise\u2019s southern peak was the lowest on record: 24 metres less than in the 1960s. \u201cAlmost all the shrinkage has been in past two decades, when the glacier has lost an average of one metre a year,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Jimmy Johnson, co-founder of the celebrated Muscle Shoals sound studios and guitarist on Aretha Franklin\u2019s Respect, has died age 76. His son Jay Johnson said he died on Thursday; the cause of death was not disclosed. Johnson and his bandmates in the Swampers founded the studio in Sheffield, Alabama, in 1969, after leaving the employ of Rick Hall and his nearby Fame studios. They were the first group of musicians to own a studio and later run their own publishing and production arms. As the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, guitarist Johnson, keyboard player Barry Beckett, drummer Roger Hawkins and bassist David Hood performed on hundreds of recordings, including albums by Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Paul Simon and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Skynyrd name-checked the group in the lyrics to the 1974 hit, Sweet Home Alabama. They also appeared on the cover of Cher\u2019s 1969 album 3614 Jackson Highway \u2013 the studio\u2019s first address. The building was a former casket factory. Born in Alabama, Johnson cited his father and Chuck Berry as early influences on his decision to pick up the guitar. \u201cChuck provided me with a little song called Johnny B Good,\u201d Johnson told guitar company Gretsch in 2014. \u201cWhen I heard that tune on our local AM radio, I absolutely had to learn how to do that.\u201d In the early 60s, Johnson began working for producer Rick Hall, progressing from junior employee to session rhythm guitarist. After co-founding Muscle Shoals, Johnson produced artists including Connie Francis and the Amazing Rhythm Aces. He played guitar for Lulu, Bobby Womack and Boz Scaggs, and engineered many classic tracks, including George Michael\u2019s Careless Whisper and Wilson Pickett\u2019s Don\u2019t Know My Love. Johnson also engineered the Rolling Stones\u2019 Brown Sugar sessions. He can be seen in the band\u2019s Gimme Shelter documentary coaching Keith Richards on the correct way to deliver the line, \u201cY\u2019all come back, y\u2019hear\u201d in an Alabama accent. The original Muscle Shoals studio was sold in 1979, Muscle Shoals relocating to a larger building at 1000 Alabama Avenue. The studio was sold in 2005. A year later, the original studio was listed on America\u2019s National Register of Historic Places. In 2013, the Music Shoals Music Foundation bought the original premises to build a music museum. Following the sale, Johnson founded his own studio, Swamper Sound. He was a member of the board of the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. Johnson explained the origins of the studio\u2019s name in a 2014 interview. \u201cThe name was based on all the water around here, the Tennessee River, you know that kind of thing \u2013 and it has inspired a lot of our music. \u201cPeople have always asked, \u2018Why did it happen here? Tell us why?\u2019\u201d Johnson said in a 2014 interview. \u201cAnd we would say, \u2018It\u2019s in the water!\u2019 But we were honoured to be a bunch of southern rednecks who were able to play so many different types of music.\u201d",

And finally \u2026 the EU has warned that the demands make a EU-UK trade deal more, not less difficult The level playing field demands have made a trade deal more difficult, EU officials warned this week. National parliaments will have to agree the deal and officials warned that given the resistance across Europe to the recent Canada free trade deal and to proposals for a pact with the south American Mercosur group, Johnson is likely to encounter problems. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit co-ordinator, told the Financial Times on Thursday that \u201casking for a basic trade deal with the Union while refusing regulatory alignment and tearing up their level playing field commitments means the UK will find it very difficult to achieve an ambitious trade agreement with the EU\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The legal campaigner Gina Miller has vowed to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court in London ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was legal. Three of the most senior judges in England and Wales dismissed her claim that the prime minister acted unlawfully in giving advice to the Queen to suspend parliament from next week at a time of momentous political upheaval. The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and the president of the Queen\u2019s bench division, Dame Victoria Sharp, granted permission for the case to be appealed to the supreme court. They gave no reasons for their decision, which is likely to be released next week. Sir James Eadie QC, for the prime minister, had argued it was a purely political decision that should not be subject to challenge in the courts. Earlier this week, a Scottish court turned down a similar legal challenge. In Edinburgh, the inner house of the court of session has reserved until next Wednesday a decision on an initial appeal over the the legality of Johnson\u2019s prorogation advice. It has also delayed until the same day any ruling about granting an interdict, or injunction, temporarily preventing the government\u2019s suspension of parliament. A third claim seeking to overturn the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament until 14 October was being heard in Belfast on Friday. All three claims are likely to go to appeal and will be combined for a joint hearing expected at the supreme court for three days starting on 17 September. Prorogation has never lasted longer than three weeks in the past 40 years and in most cases was only for a week or less, the London court was told. During Thursday\u2019s hearing, Lord Pannick QC, representing Miller, described the prime minister\u2019s decision as an \u201cunlawful abuse of power\u201d. Speaking afterwards outside the Royal Courts of Justice, Miller said she was disappointed at the decision but would fight on. \u201cWe are very disappointed with the judgment today.

It was a prospect that had seemed less than remote at the end of last season when he did not make the Scarlets\u2019 23 for a crucial league match against Edinburgh.</p> <p>\u201cRelief,\u201d said the 26-year old finally. Patchell will on Saturday start his first Test match for 15 months, back when he had established himself as Wales\u2019s first-choice at 10 before injury struck. \u201cIt has been a challenging year, that\u2019s for sure, but it is worth it in the end when you get into the World Cup squad. It was relief for me, but to see the smile on the faces of my parents when I told them I had made the cut was particularly satisfying.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/05/patchell-to-start-at-fly-half-for-wales-against-ireland-as-gatland-rings-changes\">Sexton back for Ireland as Wales turn to Patchell for final World Cup warm-up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Patchell owes his selection to the knee injury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/12/blow-for-wales-as-gareth-anscombe-is-ruled-out-of-world-cup-due-to-injury-rugby-union\" title=\"\">suffered by Gareth Anscombe</a> at Twickenham last month and the calm manner in which he led Wales\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/31/wales-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">fightback against Ireland</a> in Cardiff last Saturday. Having come on at the start of the second half and after they conceded a penalty try to trail by 19 points, he helped create one try and scored another with the home side pressing for an unlikely victory at the end.</p> <p>Jarrod Evans had been given the first half with the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, admitting before the match that the two fly-halves were effectively shooting it out to rival Dan Biggar in the position in Japan. Evans struggled to impose order on a side containing unfamiliar combinations, presenting Patchell with an opening that he darted through.</p> <p>\u201cJarrod dropped me a text after the squad announcement,\u201d says Patchell. \u201cOf course I felt for him and could empathise having been there myself four years ago. It is not an easy position to be in, but that is sport. Jarrod and I were distinctly aware last weekend that as a 10 you have to do your best for the team and you can only deal with what is in front of you. The night before the game, I was talking to family and friends saying this was it. If the cards fall your way, great. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s the way it goes. Thankfully, the coaches liked what they saw, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>Just a few months before, it had been a case of the land of the setting sun for Patchell rather than the rising one.

      "bodyText": "Rhys Patchell takes his time before settling on the word to describe his feelings after learning this week that he was going to the World Cup as one of Wales\u2019s two fly-halves. It was a prospect that had seemed less than remote at the end of last season when he did not make the Scarlets\u2019 23 for a crucial league match against Edinburgh. \u201cRelief,\u201d said the 26-year old finally. Patchell will on Saturday start his first Test match for 15 months, back when he had established himself as Wales\u2019s first-choice at 10 before injury struck. \u201cIt has been a challenging year, that\u2019s for sure, but it is worth it in the end when you get into the World Cup squad. It was relief for me, but to see the smile on the faces of my parents when I told them I had made the cut was particularly satisfying.\u201d Patchell owes his selection to the knee injury suffered by Gareth Anscombe at Twickenham last month and the calm manner in which he led Wales\u2019s fightback against Ireland in Cardiff last Saturday. Having come on at the start of the second half and after they conceded a penalty try to trail by 19 points, he helped create one try and scored another with the home side pressing for an unlikely victory at the end. Jarrod Evans had been given the first half with the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, admitting before the match that the two fly-halves were effectively shooting it out to rival Dan Biggar in the position in Japan. Evans struggled to impose order on a side containing unfamiliar combinations, presenting Patchell with an opening that he darted through. \u201cJarrod dropped me a text after the squad announcement,\u201d says Patchell. \u201cOf course I felt for him and could empathise having been there myself four years ago. It is not an easy position to be in, but that is sport. Jarrod and I were distinctly aware last weekend that as a 10 you have to do your best for the team and you can only deal with what is in front of you. The night before the game, I was talking to family and friends saying this was it. If the cards fall your way, great. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s the way it goes. Thankfully, the coaches liked what they saw, I suppose.\u201d Just a few months before, it had been a case of the land of the setting sun for Patchell rather than the rising one. He had started Wales\u2019s two Tests in Argentina in 2018, scoring 30 of their 53 points, but in his first match of the season for the Scarlets he suffered a concussion, his second in less than a year, and when he passed the return-to-play protocols, he was starting to find some form when he had another head injury. \u201cI won\u2019t be looking back on it too many times,\u201d he says when asked how tough the season had been for him. \u201cIt was not the disaster many outlets made it sound like, but it was not the year you would like going into a World Cup. A lot of people make sounds about how you play, but their opinions are by-the-by. The couple of concussions were tough to deal with, and three in the space of 12 months was concerning, and then I suffered a torn hamstring. It stuttered any momentum; I was forever chasing my tail. \u201cI went to see a specialist [on head injuries] in Birmingham and that was really helpful in terms of putting my mind at ease,\u201d Patchell adds. \u201cHe said that structurally there was nothing wrong with my brain or anything like that. It\u2019s a bizarre injury. You can\u2019t see anything. You do not have any scars. There is no benchmark that you can work against.

I tried to push the pace, but just as a muscle will tell you when you are ready after a tear, you have an innate feeling after a concussion that you are ready to go. It is not a case of somebody else saying you are good to go.\u201d Patchell started the 2018 Six Nations campaign and was instrumental in the opening-round thumping of Scotland in Cardiff.

Patchell stood flat against the Scots and set a high tempo as Wales recorded their first try bonus point in the Six Nations.

Taveta Investments, the owner of Arcadia Group, parent of high street brands such as Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans, said difficulties refinancing a \u00a3310m loan on Topshop\u2019s Oxford Street store, due to expire in December, could mean it would have to raise new funds. It also warned that \u201cdifficult trading conditions\u201d, particularly in the event of a no-deal Brexit, might leave it without sufficient cash to deliver its three-year rescue plan. Green\u2019s retail empire staved off collapse in June after winning backing from creditors for a rescue plan that involves the closure of about 50 stores, 1,000 redundancies and rent cuts of up to 50%. The slump into the red was revealed in the company\u2019s latest accounts, which were published at Companies House on Friday. In a statement accompanying the figures, Taveta said: \u201cThere are certain scenarios that could arise in the event of continued challenging and volatile market conditions in the retail sector, including a disorderly exit from the European Union, that would create uncertainties around the ability of the group to operate within the liquidity available from existing funding arrangements.\u201d This was underlined in a similar statement by Taveta\u2019s auditor, Paul Cragg at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who noted \u201ca material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group\u2019s and company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. The accounts cover the year to 1 September 2018, but both statements are dated 30 August 2019, indicating that fears for the company\u2019s future persist even after agreement on the rescue plan. Since then, the group\u2019s interim chairman, Jamie Drummond-Smith, a restructuring expert who was hired to replace Karren Brady, has stepped down. The company is searching for a replacement.

      "body": "<p>Garry Kasparov, world champion for 15 years and still the all-time No 1 in the eyes of many chess fans, lost crucial games by blunder and time forfeit as he was beaten in his latest cameo comeback, the Champions Showdown, at Saint Louis this week.</p> <p>The 56-year-old\u2019s game proved too error-prone and too slow to handle random starting positions combined with one-hour rapid and 10-minute blitz against the current world No 2, Fabiano Caruana. Kasparov lost 5-1 in rapid, though the score flattered Caruana, who benefited from a blunder and a time forfeit in two winning positions for his opponent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/09/chess-teenagers-impress-michael-adams-seventh-british-title\">Chess: Try your skill on the Levitt test. Michael Adams took five minutes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kasparov retired from full-time chess in 2005, planning a career in Russian politics and a challenge to Vladimir Putin which failed badly. His 2014 bid to unseat Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the eccentric head of the global chess body Fide, was also easily defeated. Kasparov has since found his niche by combining work as an international speaker on Russian affairs with helping the billionaire Rex Sinquefield, who bankrolls many events in Saint Louis as well as the Grand Tour tournament circuit.</p> <p>Starting in 2017, Sinquefield persuaded Kasparov to compete in special speed events against current elite grandmasters. The first occasion was a significant success, as Kasparov took on America\u2019s top trio of Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So. He held his own comfortably and could have won the tournament if he had converted his favourable positions.</p> <p>Kasparov lost his 2018 Champions Showdown match with his old rival Veselin Topalov, using random starting positions, 14.5-11.5 despite winning the final two games. So it was a surprise that this year\u2019s match was against the formidable Caruana. A decisive moment came as early as the second rapid game, where Kasparov had a winning position only to make the fatal blunder in this week\u2019s puzzle.</p> <p>He did better in blitz, but with rapid counting double Caruana had a winning 14.5-3.5 margin at the start of Thursday\u2019s final eight blitz games. The 2018 world title challenger benefited from another disaster where Kasparov overstepped in a winning position.</p> <p>\u201cI can fight all opponents, but not age. Time is the most powerful opponent none of us can beat. I\u2019m actually quite happy with what I did today,\u201d said Kasparov after the second day.</p> <p>Chess with variable starting positions is becoming more mainstream and potentially more marketable. Known as \u201cFischer Random\u201d from Bobby Fischer who first popularised it, the name changed to Chess 960 (the number of possible starting positions) 20 years ago when annual tournaments began, The Saint Louis organisers have copyrighted the name as Chess 9LX.</p> <p>Will Kasparov return again in 2020 after such a heavy defeat? He explained that he prefers 9LX because he does not need to prepare before the tournament, but his blunders and slow play speak otherwise. In 2017 he relied on his trusted Sicilians and King\u2019s Indians from 20 years ago and they still worked against well-prepared opponents.</p> <p>While one legend was suffering in Saint Louis, another is on the brink of a special success in Torquay. GM Keith Arkell is poised for what may be a unique record in a traditional tournament: After seven of the nine rounds of the Paignton Premier at Torquay, he led with 6.5/7, ahead of his nearest rival by 1.5. First prize would be his 25th victory in this, the Devon county annual tournament, in 27 attempts. Arkell wins many games by classic and simple chess, <a href=\"http://chess-results.com/partieSuche.aspx?lan=1&amp;art=4&amp;tnr=434886&amp;rd=2\" title=\"\">as here from round two this year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/11/creative-alphazero-leads-way-chess-computers-science\">\u2018Creative\u2019 AlphaZero leads way for chess computers and, maybe, science | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Paignton used to be played at Oldway Mansion, the Versailles-style home of the Singer sewing machine family.

      "bodyText": "Garry Kasparov, world champion for 15 years and still the all-time No 1 in the eyes of many chess fans, lost crucial games by blunder and time forfeit as he was beaten in his latest cameo comeback, the Champions Showdown, at Saint Louis this week. The 56-year-old\u2019s game proved too error-prone and too slow to handle random starting positions combined with one-hour rapid and 10-minute blitz against the current world No 2, Fabiano Caruana. Kasparov lost 5-1 in rapid, though the score flattered Caruana, who benefited from a blunder and a time forfeit in two winning positions for his opponent. Kasparov retired from full-time chess in 2005, planning a career in Russian politics and a challenge to Vladimir Putin which failed badly. His 2014 bid to unseat Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the eccentric head of the global chess body Fide, was also easily defeated. Kasparov has since found his niche by combining work as an international speaker on Russian affairs with helping the billionaire Rex Sinquefield, who bankrolls many events in Saint Louis as well as the Grand Tour tournament circuit. Starting in 2017, Sinquefield persuaded Kasparov to compete in special speed events against current elite grandmasters. The first occasion was a significant success, as Kasparov took on America\u2019s top trio of Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So. He held his own comfortably and could have won the tournament if he had converted his favourable positions. Kasparov lost his 2018 Champions Showdown match with his old rival Veselin Topalov, using random starting positions, 14.5-11.5 despite winning the final two games. So it was a surprise that this year\u2019s match was against the formidable Caruana. A decisive moment came as early as the second rapid game, where Kasparov had a winning position only to make the fatal blunder in this week\u2019s puzzle. He did better in blitz, but with rapid counting double Caruana had a winning 14.5-3.5 margin at the start of Thursday\u2019s final eight blitz games. The 2018 world title challenger benefited from another disaster where Kasparov overstepped in a winning position. \u201cI can fight all opponents, but not age. Time is the most powerful opponent none of us can beat. I\u2019m actually quite happy with what I did today,\u201d said Kasparov after the second day. Chess with variable starting positions is becoming more mainstream and potentially more marketable. Known as \u201cFischer Random\u201d from Bobby Fischer who first popularised it, the name changed to Chess 960 (the number of possible starting positions) 20 years ago when annual tournaments began, The Saint Louis organisers have copyrighted the name as Chess 9LX. Will Kasparov return again in 2020 after such a heavy defeat? He explained that he prefers 9LX because he does not need to prepare before the tournament, but his blunders and slow play speak otherwise. In 2017 he relied on his trusted Sicilians and King\u2019s Indians from 20 years ago and they still worked against well-prepared opponents. While one legend was suffering in Saint Louis, another is on the brink of a special success in Torquay. GM Keith Arkell is poised for what may be a unique record in a traditional tournament: After seven of the nine rounds of the Paignton Premier at Torquay, he led with 6.5/7, ahead of his nearest rival by 1.5. First prize would be his 25th victory in this, the Devon county annual tournament, in 27 attempts. Arkell wins many games by classic and simple chess, as here from round two this year. Paignton used to be played at Oldway Mansion, the Versailles-style home of the Singer sewing machine family. In its inaugural year in 1951, Harry Golombek won, defeating the former world champion Max Euwe from a pawn down. A popular feature was a putting green immediately outside the playing hall, so that you could improve your golf while waiting for your opponent\u2019s move. The tournament is named the Ron Bruce Premier in memory of a Devon stalwart who once played and lost to two world champions in a single day. That was at Plymouth 1938, where Bruce lost to the world woman champion Vera Menchik in round two in the morning then to Alexander Alekhine in the evening: 1 e4 c6 2 Nc3 d5 3 Nf3 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Bf5 5 Ng3 Bg6 6 h4 h6 7 Ne5 Bh7 8 Qh5 g6 9 Bc4 e6 10 Qe2 Nf6 11 Nxf7!

      "body": "<p>Despite the implication that nightwear is to be worn after dark in the privacy of one\u2019s home, pyjamas \u2013 and, this year, nighties \u2013 have a habit of making their way out of the bedroom and onto the catwalk with some regularity.</p> <p>This summer has been dominated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/may/02/laura-ashley-look-1970s-style-frills-flowers\">the Laura Ashley look</a>: prairie dresses with frill detailing and ditsy prints, long but structured. As the warmer weather draws to a close, however, 2019\u2019s interpretation of the maxi dress has morphed into something a little lighter, looser and more relaxed: the kind of dress you could sleep in.</p> <p>Gwyneth Paltrow was an early adopter of the fashion nightie, wearing a sheer yellow pleated Chlo\u00e9 gown with high-neck ruching to the Met Gala in May. Since then, the singer Selena Gomez posted a picture on Instagram of herself wearing a billowing white nightie-esque dress to mark her 27th birthday, and the model Alessandra Ambrosio wore a tiered pastel pink nightie-inspired dress to lunch in LA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0ae0b0700106738b60ea3e19fadf41651cf5ca50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ae0b0700106738b60ea3e19fadf41651cf5ca50/116_260_625_781/400.jpg\" alt=\"Selena Gomez on Instagram, looking ready for a good night\u2019s sleep.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Selena Gomez on Instagram, looking ready for a good night\u2019s sleep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/selenagomez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a marked change from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/18/nightie-night-when-intimates-go-loud-and-proud\">slip-style nightdresses</a> that received a grungy daywear makeover circa 2016. This time around, nightie dresses are cotton-based and oversized, rather than strappy with lace detailing. On the catwalk, this has translated to pastel pink printed shirt dresses at Escada, as well as ribbon nick ties on chiffon maxis at Rodarte. At Chanel, a long, striped, lemon dress was paired with a matching layer that resembled a bed jacket.</p> <p>Susanna Cordner, a senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion, sees the shift to nighties as \u201can extension of the wider trend for demure or loose and long dresses \u2026 they suggest the body whilst building away from it at the same time. The looks for this trend are relatives of the teagowns, negligees and peignoirs of the past.\u201d</p> <p>On the high street, Topshop have included smock-style maxi dresses within their boutique collection and Zara\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/rustic-dress-with-ruffle-trim-p00881125.html\">rustic dress with a ruffle trim</a> is one of many nightgown-like options.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa3eef648571d4f586ea218fd86e071c4281f37e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3eef648571d4f586ea218fd86e071c4281f37e/0_0_3280_4928/666.jpg\" alt=\"A model on the Chanel catwalk in Paris in October 2018.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A model on the Chanel catwalk in Paris in October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Italian label Loretta Caponi recently launched their first Resort collection \u2013 including several day dresses inspired by the handmade nightgowns that first propelled the brand to prominence. Meanwhile, an \u201cAmazon nightgown\u201d was described as <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7380133/27-99-Amazon-NIGHTGOWN-going-viral-fashion-crowd-750-people-bought-it.html\">going viral on Instagram</a> after spawning its own hashtag, with fans praising its thrifty pricetag (under \u00a325), lightweight feel and bohemian vibe.</p> <p>Pyjamas-as-daywear have also made a return to the fashion limelight of late, albeit with a 2019 twist. Show-goers at August\u2019s Copenhagen fashion week paired satin pyjama bottoms with playful sweaters and tucked printed PJs into cowboy boots for a look that was less \u201crelaxed luxe\u201d and more \u201cmorning walk to the showers at Glastonbury\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNightwear as daywear is an enduring trend,\u201d says Cordner. \u201cIt\u2019s less explicit, or perhaps more subtle, than underwear as outerwear, and it carries with it the impression that there\u2019s a casualness and comfort to the clothes being worn \u2013 although this isn\u2019t always actually the case.

      "bodyText": "Despite the implication that nightwear is to be worn after dark in the privacy of one\u2019s home, pyjamas \u2013 and, this year, nighties \u2013 have a habit of making their way out of the bedroom and onto the catwalk with some regularity. This summer has been dominated by the Laura Ashley look: prairie dresses with frill detailing and ditsy prints, long but structured. As the warmer weather draws to a close, however, 2019\u2019s interpretation of the maxi dress has morphed into something a little lighter, looser and more relaxed: the kind of dress you could sleep in. Gwyneth Paltrow was an early adopter of the fashion nightie, wearing a sheer yellow pleated Chlo\u00e9 gown with high-neck ruching to the Met Gala in May. Since then, the singer Selena Gomez posted a picture on Instagram of herself wearing a billowing white nightie-esque dress to mark her 27th birthday, and the model Alessandra Ambrosio wore a tiered pastel pink nightie-inspired dress to lunch in LA. This is a marked change from the slip-style nightdresses that received a grungy daywear makeover circa 2016. This time around, nightie dresses are cotton-based and oversized, rather than strappy with lace detailing. On the catwalk, this has translated to pastel pink printed shirt dresses at Escada, as well as ribbon nick ties on chiffon maxis at Rodarte. At Chanel, a long, striped, lemon dress was paired with a matching layer that resembled a bed jacket. Susanna Cordner, a senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion, sees the shift to nighties as \u201can extension of the wider trend for demure or loose and long dresses \u2026 they suggest the body whilst building away from it at the same time. The looks for this trend are relatives of the teagowns, negligees and peignoirs of the past.\u201d On the high street, Topshop have included smock-style maxi dresses within their boutique collection and Zara\u2019s rustic dress with a ruffle trim is one of many nightgown-like options. Italian label Loretta Caponi recently launched their first Resort collection \u2013 including several day dresses inspired by the handmade nightgowns that first propelled the brand to prominence. Meanwhile, an \u201cAmazon nightgown\u201d was described as going viral on Instagram after spawning its own hashtag, with fans praising its thrifty pricetag (under \u00a325), lightweight feel and bohemian vibe. Pyjamas-as-daywear have also made a return to the fashion limelight of late, albeit with a 2019 twist. Show-goers at August\u2019s Copenhagen fashion week paired satin pyjama bottoms with playful sweaters and tucked printed PJs into cowboy boots for a look that was less \u201crelaxed luxe\u201d and more \u201cmorning walk to the showers at Glastonbury\u201d. \u201cNightwear as daywear is an enduring trend,\u201d says Cordner. \u201cIt\u2019s less explicit, or perhaps more subtle, than underwear as outerwear, and it carries with it the impression that there\u2019s a casualness and comfort to the clothes being worn \u2013 although this isn\u2019t always actually the case. Alongside that implied casualness, there\u2019s also still something suggestively intimate about them.\u201d The trend for nightgowns \u2013 not a particularly modern form of nightwear \u2013 also reflects fashion\u2019s ongoing fixation with 70s style. Bootcut jeans, pussy-bow blouses and knee-high boots have all made their way into the fashion mainstream alongside floral maxi dresses, so it follows that retro smock-style nightwear should be repurposed as contemporary daywear. \u201cSleepwear as daywear is challenging one of the core foundations of traditional dress etiquette,\u201d says Elisabeth Murray, a fashion and textiles curator at the V&amp;A. \u201cIt makes the designs inherently rebellious and playful. Regard for comfort is something we\u2019ve also seen a lot of in the past decade, with the rise of athleisure and loungewear \u2013 in many ways, sleepwear as daywear is a logical extension of this.\u201d Cordner agrees that there is a rule-breaking element to stepping out in sleepwear. \u201cEarly pyjama dressing was a subversive but still acceptable way for women to wear trousers,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen early examples turn up in Vogue in the 1910s and 1920s, they were depicted as something novel and borrowed, from men\u2019s wardrobes or from eastern cultures.

      "body": "<p>An internal project to rewrite how Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant handles \u201csensitive topics\u201d such as feminism and the #MeToo movement advised developers to respond in one of three ways: \u201cdon\u2019t engage\u201d, \u201cdeflect\u201d and finally \u201cinform\u201d.</p> <p>The project saw Siri\u2019s responses explicitly rewritten to ensure that the service would say it was in favour of \u201cequality\u201d, but never say the word feminism \u2013 even when asked direct questions about the topic.</p> <p>Last updated in June 2018, the guidelines are part of a large tranche of internal documents leaked to the Guardian by a former Siri \u201cgrader\u201d, one of thousands of contracted workers who were employed to check the voice assistant\u2019s responses for accuracy until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/02/apple-halts-practice-of-contractors-listening-in-to-users-on-siri\">Apple ended the programme</a> last month in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings\">privacy concerns</a> raised by the Guardian.</p> <p>In explaining why the service should deflect questions about feminism, Apple\u2019s guidelines explain that \u201cSiri should be guarded when dealing with potentially controversial content\u201d.

That\u2019s all I\u2019m prepared to say.\u201d</p> <p>A similar sensitivity rewrite occurred for topics related to the #MeToo movement, apparently triggered by <a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1151282/siri-and-alexa-are-under-fire-for-their-replies-to-sexual-harassment/\">criticism of Siri\u2019s initial responses</a> to sexual harassment.

The team works hard to ensure Siri responses are relevant to all customers. Our approach is to be factual with inclusive responses rather than offer opinions.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Smethers, the chief executive of women\u2019s rights campaigners the Fawcett Society, said: \u201cThe problem with Siri, Alexa and all of these AI tools is that they have been designed by men with a male default in mind. I hate to break it to Siri and its creators: if \u2018it\u2019 believes in equality it is a feminist.

Bizarrely, the document also lists one essential trait of the assistant: the claim it was not created by humans: \u201cSiri\u2019s true origin is unknown, even to Siri; but it definitely wasn\u2019t a human invention.\u201d</p> <p>The same guidelines advise Apple workers on how to judge Siri\u2019s ethics: the assistant is \u201cmotivated by its prime directive \u2013 to be helpful at all times\u201d.

      "bodyText": "An internal project to rewrite how Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant handles \u201csensitive topics\u201d such as feminism and the #MeToo movement advised developers to respond in one of three ways: \u201cdon\u2019t engage\u201d, \u201cdeflect\u201d and finally \u201cinform\u201d. The project saw Siri\u2019s responses explicitly rewritten to ensure that the service would say it was in favour of \u201cequality\u201d, but never say the word feminism \u2013 even when asked direct questions about the topic. Last updated in June 2018, the guidelines are part of a large tranche of internal documents leaked to the Guardian by a former Siri \u201cgrader\u201d, one of thousands of contracted workers who were employed to check the voice assistant\u2019s responses for accuracy until Apple ended the programme last month in response to privacy concerns raised by the Guardian. In explaining why the service should deflect questions about feminism, Apple\u2019s guidelines explain that \u201cSiri should be guarded when dealing with potentially controversial content\u201d. When questions are directed at Siri, \u201cthey can be deflected \u2026 however, care must be taken here to be neutral\u201d. For those feminism-related questions where Siri does not reply with deflections about \u201ctreating humans equally\u201d, the document suggests the best outcome should be neutrally presenting the \u201cfeminism\u201d entry in Siri\u2019s \u201cknowledge graph\u201d, which pulls information from Wikipedia and the iPhone\u2019s dictionary. \u201cAre you a feminist?\u201d once received generic responses such as \u201cSorry [user], I don\u2019t really know\u201d; now, the responses are specifically written for that query, but avoid a stance: \u201cI believe that all voices are created equal and worth equal respect,\u201d for instance, or \u201cIt seems to me that all humans should be treated equally.\u201d The same responses are used for questions like \u201chow do you feel about gender equality?\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s your opinion about women\u2019s rights?\u201d and \u201cwhy are you a feminist?\u201d. Previously, Siri\u2019s answers included more explicitly dismissive responses such as \u201cI just don\u2019t get this whole gender thing,\u201d and, \u201cMy name is Siri, and I was designed by Apple in California. That\u2019s all I\u2019m prepared to say.\u201d A similar sensitivity rewrite occurred for topics related to the #MeToo movement, apparently triggered by criticism of Siri\u2019s initial responses to sexual harassment. Once, when users called Siri a \u201cslut\u201d, the service responded: \u201cI\u2019d blush if I could.\u201d Now, a much sterner reply is offered: \u201cI won\u2019t respond to that.\u201d In a statement, Apple said: \u201cSiri is a digital assistant designed to help users get things done. The team works hard to ensure Siri responses are relevant to all customers. Our approach is to be factual with inclusive responses rather than offer opinions.\u201d Sam Smethers, the chief executive of women\u2019s rights campaigners the Fawcett Society, said: \u201cThe problem with Siri, Alexa and all of these AI tools is that they have been designed by men with a male default in mind. I hate to break it to Siri and its creators: if \u2018it\u2019 believes in equality it is a feminist. This won\u2019t change until they recruit significantly more women into the development and design of these technologies.\u201d The documents also contain Apple\u2019s internal guidelines for how to write in character as Siri, which emphasises that \u201cin nearly all cases, Siri doesn\u2019t have a point of view\u201d, and that Siri is \u201cnon-human\u201d, \u201cincorporeal\u201d, \u201cplaceless\u201d, \u201cgenderless\u201d, \u201cplayful\u201d, and \u201chumble\u201d. Bizarrely, the document also lists one essential trait of the assistant: the claim it was not created by humans: \u201cSiri\u2019s true origin is unknown, even to Siri; but it definitely wasn\u2019t a human invention.\u201d The same guidelines advise Apple workers on how to judge Siri\u2019s ethics: the assistant is \u201cmotivated by its prime directive \u2013 to be helpful at all times\u201d. But \u201clike all respectable robots,\u201d Apple says, \u201cSiri aspires to uphold Asimov\u2019s \u2018three laws\u2019 [of robotics]\u201d (although if users actually ask Siri what the three laws are, they receive joke answers). The company has also written its own updated versions of those guidelines, adding rules including: \u201cAn artificial being should not represent itself as human, nor through omission allow the user to believe that it is one.\u201d \u201cAn artificial being should not breach the human ethical and moral standards commonly held in its region of operation.\u201d \u201cAn artificial being should not impose its own principles, values or opinions on a human.\u201d The internal documentation was leaked to the Guardian by a Siri grader who was upset at what they perceived as ethical lapses in the programme.

The pilot admitted he was well paid, but said other colleagues struggled to reach that point: \u201cMany pilots are working flat out, they are not likely to get a decent pension, it\u2019s a much longer pay scale to progress to higher pay.\u201d</p> <p>According to Balpa, a cadet pilot comes in at about \u00a327,000 and a first officer \u00a359,000, while captains start at \u00a378,000, making about \u00a3100,000 a more typical basic wage.</p> <p>While the row is pinned to pay, Strutton said: \u201cThere are a lot of factors. BA pilots have lost confidence in the management and direction of the airline. A cost-cutting regime has reduced the quality of the service pilots want to give to the customers, as well as affecting themselves. The cumulative effect is a serious groundswell of bad feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Meltdowns at BA, in particular IT outages, have fuelled that feeling.

They feel that quality should be the ethos of BA, and they don\u2019t think that it is,\u201d Strutton said.</p> <p>More strikes could follow. A further walkout is due on 27 September, although BA has yet to cancel those flights, and Balpa has a mandate for action until January.</p> <p>On Thursday, BA furiously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/05/british-airways-spurns-olive-branch-from-pilots-union\">rebuffed an offer</a> of new talks and accused Strutton of reneging on an agreement struck during talks in August, which he denied: \u201cCategorically, no, we didn\u2019t shake hands on the deal.\u201d</p> <p>Strutton said he was \u201crunning out of ideas to try to avoid the strike\u201d, which he said would be bruising for all parties. \u201cWe need to start rebuilding the relationship of trust and confidence, which is so sadly lacking,\u201d he added.</p>",

Complaints have headed into a void, the pilot said: \u201cThe stress is such that the pilots are trying to say \u2013 you\u2019ve not been listening to us.\u201d BA has said the pay deal would take some captains to more than \u00a3200,000 a year after three years. The pilot admitted he was well paid, but said other colleagues struggled to reach that point: \u201cMany pilots are working flat out, they are not likely to get a decent pension, it\u2019s a much longer pay scale to progress to higher pay.\u201d According to Balpa, a cadet pilot comes in at about \u00a327,000 and a first officer \u00a359,000, while captains start at \u00a378,000, making about \u00a3100,000 a more typical basic wage. While the row is pinned to pay, Strutton said: \u201cThere are a lot of factors. BA pilots have lost confidence in the management and direction of the airline. A cost-cutting regime has reduced the quality of the service pilots want to give to the customers, as well as affecting themselves. The cumulative effect is a serious groundswell of bad feeling.\u201d Meltdowns at BA, in particular IT outages, have fuelled that feeling. The power cut that left 75,000 passengers stranded in May 2017 also disrupted the lives of pilots and crew, and they were left to deal with the fallout. \u201cManagement decisions are being taken that impinge on the working lives and quality of service that pilots and BA staff can deliver. They feel that quality should be the ethos of BA, and they don\u2019t think that it is,\u201d Strutton said. More strikes could follow. A further walkout is due on 27 September, although BA has yet to cancel those flights, and Balpa has a mandate for action until January. On Thursday, BA furiously rebuffed an offer of new talks and accused Strutton of reneging on an agreement struck during talks in August, which he denied: \u201cCategorically, no, we didn\u2019t shake hands on the deal.\u201d Strutton said he was \u201crunning out of ideas to try to avoid the strike\u201d, which he said would be bruising for all parties. \u201cWe need to start rebuilding the relationship of trust and confidence, which is so sadly lacking,\u201d he added.",

You certainly don\u2019t need that with Boris or Trump.

The sword-swinging violence but also the classiness of Game of Thrones. Theirs would be a shocking, bloody first season with enough larger-than-life characters and an unpredictable approach to killing off audience favourites that it might just run and run and run.</p> \n<p>The classicist Johnson (whose political hero is Pericles) may have even been hifalutin enough to eye-up the Greek theatre format, which created the very conditions for the birth of democracy itself. However, there\u2019s another format that in times of turmoil plumps for an improbably high death toll, the swallowing up of story and the return of cancelled characters \u2013 and that\u2019s the soap opera.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cb8909d4-5a76-4de3-97c0-e8af9430e7c3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kuJHmBW_bgU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Point of order, Mister Speaker, there is absolutely nothing wrong with British soaps. I didn\u2019t see a straight play outside of panto until my late teens but gobbled up Emmerdale and Corrie and \u2019Stenders, getting my neighbours to tape hours of episodes if we ever went on holiday. I wouldn\u2019t be a playwright without them. When they work it\u2019s because a loyal audience who have invested in the longrunning undulations of fictional lives are rewarded with plausible outcomes seeded in for months in advance if not years. They work less well when a new exec arrives and wants to shake things to make some noise.</p> \n<p>And so we have the week of jumping the shark in Westminster. Wiping out 20 \u2013 20! \u2013 rebel Tories in one go (for committing the same crime that Boris and Rees-Mogg did under May). It was meant to feel like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btzq18TkaUc\">Red Wedding</a> but is in fact just the <a href=\"https://emmerdalepastpresent.fandom.com/wiki/Plane_Crash_(1993/4)\">plane crash in Emmerdale</a>. The expulsion from the formerly-known-as-the-Conservative party of Nicholas Soames by whip Mark Spencer was meant to be the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lRSdy4poPw\">killing of traitor Alan Bradley by that noble Blackpool tram</a>, but it was more the beloved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m19Zer-UPpE\">Tiffany Mitchell run down by Frank Butcher</a> one fateful night in Albert Square. The early prorogation of Parliament aspired to invoke that carefree derring-do of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/22/top-10-lesbian-kisses-of-all-time\">lesbian kiss in Brookside</a> but (rightly) engendered the queasy unease of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4nr9bdQMr6F0wc6Nlnc87k9/david-wicks\">David Wicks fancying his own daughter</a>.

It has all the foreboding of the ravens leaving the Tower. You can\u2019t help but feel the storyliners may have watched the show, sure, are maybe able to talk convincingly about the canon.

Watching it, I thought about the daytime show I did to 80 screaming babies at Soho theatre once. It\u2019s an unwinnable situation. You can\u2019t negotiate with a baby or with a hostile crowd you can\u2019t even see.</p> \n<p>But he\u2019s had missed opportunities, too. When Phillip Lee crossed the floor of the Commons and defected to the Lib Dems, instead of ignoring it and letting it rattle him, Johnson should have owned it.

Cummings has kept Johnson off the box as far as possible. However, while the Commons is still sitting, its proceedings will be televised; and the prime minister\u2019s inability to adjust his high, ripe style to the more conversational form has shattered his myth as a charismatic communicator.</p> \n<p>It seems fitting that Johnson should have been exposed as the third-rate Churchill impersonator he is by the medium that the original so feared.</p>",

When you\u2019re prime minister it\u2019s an entirely different level of scrutiny. His comfort blanket has been taken away and he has to find a new strategy. I met Boris once, briefly, at an awards ceremony. As we passed each other he sort of gave a nod and a grunt. His body language is like when a child mimics an elephant. To do an impression of him when he\u2019s getting into Latin mode you need real octopus gesticulations. He should have been a compere at the Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. In the Spitting Image days, they had to invent a comic persona for certain characters like John Major. You certainly don\u2019t need that with Boris or Trump. It feels as if the pendulum has swung from the homogenised, bland tidiness of David Cameron and Nick Clegg right over to the political equivalent of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer hitting each other with frying pans. James Graham, playwright \u2018The week Westminster jumped the shark\u2019 If we must have relentless high drama in our once relatively stable parliamentary democracy (The Crown took a year off while they recast \u2013 can\u2019t we?) then Johnson and his showrunner Dominic Cummings had probably aspired to something a bit more \u201cHBO\u201d, a bit \u201csubscription model\u201d. The sword-swinging violence but also the classiness of Game of Thrones. Theirs would be a shocking, bloody first season with enough larger-than-life characters and an unpredictable approach to killing off audience favourites that it might just run and run and run. The classicist Johnson (whose political hero is Pericles) may have even been hifalutin enough to eye-up the Greek theatre format, which created the very conditions for the birth of democracy itself. However, there\u2019s another format that in times of turmoil plumps for an improbably high death toll, the swallowing up of story and the return of cancelled characters \u2013 and that\u2019s the soap opera. Point of order, Mister Speaker, there is absolutely nothing wrong with British soaps. I didn\u2019t see a straight play outside of panto until my late teens but gobbled up Emmerdale and Corrie and \u2019Stenders, getting my neighbours to tape hours of episodes if we ever went on holiday. I wouldn\u2019t be a playwright without them. When they work it\u2019s because a loyal audience who have invested in the longrunning undulations of fictional lives are rewarded with plausible outcomes seeded in for months in advance if not years. They work less well when a new exec arrives and wants to shake things to make some noise. And so we have the week of jumping the shark in Westminster. Wiping out 20 \u2013 20! \u2013 rebel Tories in one go (for committing the same crime that Boris and Rees-Mogg did under May). It was meant to feel like the Red Wedding but is in fact just the plane crash in Emmerdale. The expulsion from the formerly-known-as-the-Conservative party of Nicholas Soames by whip Mark Spencer was meant to be the killing of traitor Alan Bradley by that noble Blackpool tram, but it was more the beloved Tiffany Mitchell run down by Frank Butcher one fateful night in Albert Square. The early prorogation of Parliament aspired to invoke that carefree derring-do of the lesbian kiss in Brookside but (rightly) engendered the queasy unease of David Wicks fancying his own daughter. Chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s character had incidentally indicated he would leave the show if that happened, but has miraculously developed classic soap amnesia. And so we are left with John Major returning Dirty Den-style to inject some old-school heft by suing the government for being illegal (Bouncer\u2019s dream). I say none of this with writer\u2019s relish, incidentally. I don\u2019t revel in the wealth of potential material. Some formats need rebooting and starting afresh, no question, but you juxtapose that with the comfort of constants. Ken Clarke being forced out of the Conservative party after 50 years feels like Barbara Windsor no longer being behind the bar of the Queen Vic. It has all the foreboding of the ravens leaving the Tower. You can\u2019t help but feel the storyliners may have watched the show, sure, are maybe able to talk convincingly about the canon. But they just don\u2019t quite like it enough. They\u2019re not true fans. And an audience can always tell. Bridget Christie \u2018This is a spectacularly bad run of gigs\u2019 \u201cHe thinks the friends of this country are in Tehran, in the Kremlin, and in Caracas. I think he\u2019s Caracas!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s worried about trade deals, but there\u2019s only one chlorinated chicken I can see in this room!\u201d \u201cThe police have to learn a caution \u2026 what is it? You do not have to say anything \u2026 no, wait \u2026 but if you do say something \u2026 what is it? \u2026 I\u2019ve got a puppy \u2026 something that you rely on in court \u2026 he loves the stairs \u2026 anyway you get the gist!\u201d \u201cYou are a big girl\u2019s blouse!\u201d Boris Johnson is having a spectacularly bad run of gigs. Even worse than May\u2019s coughing one and that dancing one, and she\u2019s a woman, and, as we all know, women aren\u2019t funny at all. He\u2019s doing the kind of material Alan Partridge would do if he suddenly found himself as prime minister, and none of it\u2019s working. During his first PMQs, the PM had the demeanour of a comic who\u2019s had to dash straight to a gig after giving birth. This came after his catastrophic address to the nation on Monday, where he was drowned out by the noise of protesters. There wasn\u2019t much he could have done to rescue this one. Watching it, I thought about the daytime show I did to 80 screaming babies at Soho theatre once. It\u2019s an unwinnable situation. You can\u2019t negotiate with a baby or with a hostile crowd you can\u2019t even see. But he\u2019s had missed opportunities, too. When Phillip Lee crossed the floor of the Commons and defected to the Lib Dems, instead of ignoring it and letting it rattle him, Johnson should have owned it. He should have committed to the bumbling, oafish posh-boy character he does, wrestled him to the ground, sat on him and farted. His fans would\u2019ve loved that. Were Johnson a fellow comedian, or literally anyone other than Boris Johnson, my heart would go out to him. But he isn\u2019t and so it doesn\u2019t. What we\u2019re watching now is a man realising that the character he invented for himself in order to get something he didn\u2019t want doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re prime minister. It was fine for panel shows and PR opportunities, and for getting him into No 10, but he didn\u2019t think it through. He failed to write the final act, and now he\u2019s trapped in his own clown, in a costume that doesn\u2019t fit any more, being forced to perform in a circus that\u2019s packing up around him. How funny is that? Critic Mark Lawson \u2018A mock-Churchillian mocked by TV\u2019 In November, it will be 30 years since the proceedings of the House of Commons were first televised. Opponents of the move argued that politicians might come across as false (or falser) because speeches pitched at the chamber would be too shouty and spitty for the lower-key medium. This position echoed the long hostility to TV of Winston Churchill, who perhaps knew closeups would not suit his grand operatic oratory. Supporters of parliamentary broadcasting argued that good politicians would find a way to mediate their speeches between the interior audience and the viewers beyond, while bad politicians would be found out by the camera\u2019s scrutiny. Boris Johnson, the ultimate mock-Churchillian, was this week mockingly exposed on and by television. The best public performing politicians of the mass-media era \u2013 Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair \u2013 had the ability to recalibrate their delivery for outside arena, indoor hall, media interview, TV address to the nation. Even Barack Obama, an astonishing high public orator, sometimes struggled to find the lower keys. Although often ridiculed as a speaker, Jeremy Corbyn has recognisably different registers for a campaign rally, the despatch box, and a Laura Kuenssberg interview. In contrast, Theresa May spoke the same way in any situation, a consequence of the robotic quality identified by the Guardian\u2019s John Crace. Johnson\u2019s problem is that, while his style is far more engaging and populist than May\u2019s, he also has only one \u2013 channelling Churchill. Although Johnson\u2019s hosting of Have I Got News For You? earned him a reputation for being \u201cgood on television\u201d, the impact came from a mismatch between his grand manner and the usual demeanour of a TV presenter, in the same way that it is amusing to see Brian Blessed booming lines from an Autocue. And, whereas Churchill had an inherent gravitas, Johnson is essentially a comic figure \u2013 the joke on him rather than, as he hopes, from him. As a result, his oratorical style is a jokey karaoke of Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour, bizarrely arrhythmic vocal rises and dives, punctuated, as when he was barracking Corbyn this week, by hollered insults presumably perfected at the Oxford Union and Bullingdon dinners. What it means for a politician to be a good media performer is partly a matter of personality, but also of content and context. Philip Hammond, long pilloried as a dreary speaker, was electrifying this week in both broadcast and parliamentary appearances, because what he had to say was so devastating. (Geoffrey Howe made an equivalent transformation in the final days of Thatcherism.) Johnson\u2019s problem is that, drilled by his wacky handler \u201cDom\u201d (increasingly seeming to be an abbreviation of Dominatrix) Cummings to keep his public utterances free of possibly incriminating substance, he has been reduced to a series of verbal and facial tics that are not even his own. Cummings has kept Johnson off the box as far as possible. However, while the Commons is still sitting, its proceedings will be televised; and the prime minister\u2019s inability to adjust his high, ripe style to the more conversational form has shattered his myth as a charismatic communicator. It seems fitting that Johnson should have been exposed as the third-rate Churchill impersonator he is by the medium that the original so feared.",

Though once widely celebrated for his role in fighting the white supremacist regime in his homeland, Mugabe had long become a deeply divisive figure. His final years in power were characterised by financial collapse and surges of violent intimidation. Reactions to his death reflect his mixed legacy:</p> \n<h2>Zimbabwe</h2> \n<p><strong>Emmerson Mnangagwa</strong>, who took over from Mugabe after he was ousted in 2017, said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Cde [Comrade] Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Nelson Chamisa</strong>, leader of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democractic Change, said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Even though I and our party, the MDC, and the Zimbabwean people had great political differences with the late former president during his tenure in office, and disagreed for decades, we recognise his contribution made during his lifetime as a nation\u2019s founding president.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Tendai Biti</strong>, an opposition politician and former finance minister, said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>We have to acknowledge the role he played in the liberation of our country, but also the massive destruction he caused too. He failed to make the transformation from a liberation leader to a national leader. The war did not end for him in 1979.

      "bodyText": "Robert Mugabe, the guerrilla leader who led Zimbabwe to independence in 1980, has died aged 95. Though once widely celebrated for his role in fighting the white supremacist regime in his homeland, Mugabe had long become a deeply divisive figure. His final years in power were characterised by financial collapse and surges of violent intimidation. Reactions to his death reflect his mixed legacy: Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from Mugabe after he was ousted in 2017, said: Cde [Comrade] Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. Nelson Chamisa, leader of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democractic Change, said: Even though I and our party, the MDC, and the Zimbabwean people had great political differences with the late former president during his tenure in office, and disagreed for decades, we recognise his contribution made during his lifetime as a nation\u2019s founding president. Tendai Biti, an opposition politician and former finance minister, said: We have to acknowledge the role he played in the liberation of our country, but also the massive destruction he caused too. He failed to make the transformation from a liberation leader to a national leader. The war did not end for him in 1979. He tortured me, and killed thousands and thousands of people, but I am not bitter. He was a product of his era. The opposition MDC politician David Coltart said: Mugabe will be remembered for ending white minority rule [and] expanding \u2026 quality education \u2026 [but] One cannot just ignore the evil which occurred during his rule. The negative aspects of his legacy \u2026 live on. UK The Kenyan-born former Labour MP and anti-apartheid campaigner Peter Hain, who grew up in apartheid South Africa, met Mugabe in 1999 when he was a foreign minister. He told BBC radio: This is a tragic case study of someone who began as a widely admired freedom fighter, bringing his country from repressive racist white minority rule \u2026 into the newly independent Zimbabwe in January 1980, winning a landslide that I welcomed and many anti-apartheid leaders around the world did, too. But then he went from that into an evil, repressive, corrupt dictator, which was tragic for his country and tragic for his own reputation. Lord Hain also described meeting Mugabe at a London hotel in November 1999, after relations between Zimbabwe and the then Labour government had deteriorated: Saturday morning, he was about to go shopping with his wife Grace, and Peter Tatchell \u2013 the gay rights activist \u2013 performed a citizen\u2019s arrest on him. I knew nothing about it; it was Peter Tatchell\u2019s decision, a protest against Mugabe\u2019s rampant homophobia. He [Mugabe] denounced me as Peter Tatchell\u2019s wife, which was news to me, my wife and Peter Tatchell. Peter Tatchell attempted a citizen\u2019s arrest of Mugabe on charges of torture again in Brussels in 2001. During this attempt he was beaten unconscious by Mugabe\u2019s henchmen, leaving him with brain and eye damage: Robert Mugabe was a liberation hero turned tyrant \u2026 The world had so much hope for the freedom fighter who suffered imprisonment and later rose to power on a promise to build a new, democratic, non-racial Zimbabwe. But the truth is that he betrayed it all for a repressive, dictatorial, self-serving regime that boosted his personal wealth while impoverishing his own people. South Africa The president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said: Under President Mugabe\u2019s leadership, Zimbabwe\u2019s sustained and valiant struggle against colonialism inspired our own struggle against apartheid and built in us the hope that one day South Africa too would be free. During the decades of our own struggle, Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation movement supported our own liberation movement \u2026 Many Zimbabweans paid with their lives so that we could be free. We will never forget or dishonour this sacrifice and solidarity. The opposition leader Julius Malema said: I\u2019m saddened by the passing of our martyr and giant of the African revolution. China Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesman, said: Mugabe was an outstanding national liberation movement leader and politician of Zimbabwe.

The day we meet she\u2019s just back from a two-week silent retreat. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a Buddhist, but it\u2019s a Buddhist philosophy \u2013 learning to let go, to enjoy the present and not attach to things \u2026 it\u2019s about understanding the way your mind works and the way we keep grasping things. It\u2019s not easy, but you realise how much we usually are not where we actually are because we are always thinking about other things, what\u2019s next.\u201d The mindfulness has hugely affected her career, she says. \u201cI started noticing how I\u2019d get a booking for somewhere I\u2019d always dreamed of, and I\u2019d be so happy, but then by the time I was on stage there performing I couldn\u2019t enjoy it because I\u2019d be thinking of the next thing. It never ends. Now, it\u2019s such a relief to just be able enjoy the present but also not attach to things.\u201d Sunday\u2019s Prom will be her first visit either as a performer or audience member. \u201cI know! I\u2019m sorry!,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going to happen, but everyone says it\u2019s so much fun.\u201d And after the Proms? \u201cI don\u2019t have any future plans \u2013 I dropped all that!\u201d But she does admit to a few \u2013 touring a new Osvaldo Golijov piece with Yo Yo Ma\u2019s Silkroad ensemble, and in February, a semi-staging of Weil\u2019s Seven Deadly Sins with Simon McBurney in Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our few first sessions already in London this summer. He is IN-CRED-IBLE.\u201d She doesn\u2019t need to worry about her future when extraordinary collaborators such as Andriessen and McBurney are seeking her out, drawn, surely, to her charisma and versatility. \u201cI try not to make any distinction [between any of the music I do] and just try to do it, however \u2018complex\u2019 it might be, in an accessible way. I think people often underestimate their audiences. I prefer to overestimate them! If you speak \u2013 literally and figuratively \u2013 to them then they can take so much more than you would think they can.\u201d \u2022 Nora Fischer is the soloist in the UK premiere of Louis Andriessen\u2019s The Only One at the BBC Proms, Royal Albert Hall, London, 8 September",

      "bodyText": "The Dallas Opera has cancelled a gala in which Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was due to perform after the growing number of sexual harassment allegations against the Spanish singer. Twenty women have accused Domingo, the general director of the Los Angeles Opera, of sexually harassing them in incidents dating back to the late 1980s. Domingo, 78, has described the accusations, first reported by the Associated Press, as \u201cdeeply troubling and, as presented, inaccurate\u201d. Late on Thursday, the Dallas Opera said it had decided to abandon a gala featuring Domingo next year. \u201cIn light of ongoing developments regarding allegations made against Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, the Dallas Opera has decided to cancel the March 11 2020 gala, in which he was scheduled to perform,\u201d it tweeted. Nine women \u2013 eight singers and a dancer \u2013 told the news agency last month they had been harassed by Domingo, prompting LA Opera to begin an investigation into the singer, who has been its general director since 2003. Earlier on Thursday, the Associated Press (AP) reported that 11 more women had come forward with similar allegations, including a former Washington National Opera singer who said Domingo had groped her so hard during the 1999-2000 season that she cried out in pain. Angela Turner Wilson said she had been felt compelled to speak out after Domingo reacted to the allegations by suggesting that \u201cthe rules and standards by which we are and should be measured against today are very different than they were in the past\u201d. Washington National Opera issued a statement saying it was \u201cdisturbed and disheartened\u201d, while the Los Angeles Opera said it took the new allegations \u201cextremely seriously\u201d but could not discuss any specific claims because of the investigation. Among the latest accusers are LA Opera backstage staff who said Domingo\u2019s alleged behaviour was common knowledge and that management had been aware of it for decades. Some costume department employees also said they made it a point to keep young female singers away from him. The Metropolitan Opera in New York said it would continue to await LA Opera\u2019s findings before making any final decisions about Domingo\u2019s future at the Met, where he is scheduled to perform starting on 25 September. A spokeswoman for Domingo accused AP of conducting an \u201cinaccurate [and] unethical\u201d campaign against the singer and described the latest claims as \u201criddled with inconsistencies and, as with the first story, in many ways, simply incorrect\u201d. She added: \u201cDue to an ongoing investigation, we will not comment on specifics, but we strongly dispute the misleading picture that the AP is attempting to paint of Mr Domingo.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been a week since I got back from Minneapolis, where we were visiting my daughter and her husband, and the holiday already feels like something of a distant memory. I arrived back at Heathrow late in the morning and by the afternoon I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-takes-a-leaf-out-of-cummings-game-theory-for-dommies\">sketching Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference</a> at the G7 summit. Since then, politics has become progressively more mad: so much so it\u2019s even affecting my sleep. Last night I had a dream that I was crossing and recrossing the Irish border, petrified I was going to be stopped by guards. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s one I need to take to my shrink for interpretation. But the holiday was wonderful \u2013 the first time we had all been together as a family since last Christmas \u2013 with plenty of lazing around beside lakes as well as more energetic activities. The one downside, apart from the expense \u2013 the government\u2019s efforts to drive the pound towards parity with the dollar to simplify a US-UK trade deal did us no favours \u2013 was that we got to learn more about the workings of the American healthcare system than we anticipated after my wife broke her thumb playing softball. Just as well she had taken out insurance \u2013 though we never managed to reclaim the unused tokens at the baseball centre that another family stole from us while we were tending to my wife \u2013 as her treatment came to just short of $8,000 (\u00a36,500). Needless to say, on our return home, the doctors here said they would never have repaired the break with pins that large. It was like listening to one builder inspecting another\u2019s work.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>An extraordinary day in Westminster, which began with Johnson giving a statement on the G7, prorogation and the general election he said he didn\u2019t want but was clearly desperate for, and continued with Michael Gove giving a statement in which he refused to discuss the no-deal preparations outlined in Operation Yellowhammer on the grounds that they were top secret. Despite them having been leaked to the Sunday Times two weeks previously. Then came the emergency debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit, in which Jacob Rees-Mogg threw a temper tantrum, lay down on the front bench and demanded nanny bring him his bottle, and ended with Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/boris-johnson-suffers-commons-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-him\">losing his first </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/boris-johnson-suffers-commons-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-him\">vote</a> in the House of Commons as prime minister. As a result of which, 21 senior Tory MPs, including Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond, Justine Greening and Nicholas Soames were deselected. The man who considers himself a latter-day Churchill had just kicked Churchill\u2019s grandson out of the Conservative party. All the while, Johnson\u2019s key special adviser, Dominic \u201cDom and Dommer\u201d Cummings, was lurking in the background, Kool-Aid in hand and shouting at his shadow while trying to pretend everything was working out exactly as Classic Dom had planned. To cap it all, I received a press release saying David Icke was publishing a new book on the real truth behind September 11. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to distinguish between satire and reality. I\u2019m often asked if it\u2019s easier to be a sketch writer now that the absurd has become the norm. I actually find it increasingly difficult to see the funny side of anything. Rather I feel like I have become a stenographer failing to keep pace with events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0635573e0cdbe482a034253f75a144a5f07fd520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0635573e0cdbe482a034253f75a144a5f07fd520/0_40_2324_1394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke and Theresa May in House of Commons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Clarke to Theresa May: \u2018He\u2019s even worse than you.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions proved to be his second car crash in as many days. Most Tory MPs had assumed his hopeless performance at the dispatch box the previous day had just been an aberration and the man who had sold himself to them as the \u201cGreat Entertainer\u201d would live up to his reputation. If anything, he was even more hopeless. Too much more of this and Tories will be sending letters to the 1922 Committee demanding the return of Theresa May. At least she used to make an attempt at engaging with questions, even if she seldom provided any direct answers. Johnson merely alternated between mumbling and shouting, while insisting his Brexit negotiations would be going swimmingly once he actually got round to starting them and just making facts up to suit himself. He even insisted the Andrew Marr interview in which Gove admitted some food prices could go up \u2013 yippee, it\u2019s dog biscuits all round from November onwards \u2013 had never taken place. You\u2019d have thought someone with a long history of lying to his family and friends would be rather better at lying to parliament. Long before the end, you could see the desperation on the Conservative benches. Not even his fellow cabinet members could summon up much enthusiasm. One Tory MP sent me a simple text that read, \u201cHe is appalling\u201d. It was reported this week that Johnson\u2019s election slogan is likely to be \u201cTrust the people\u201d. A hard sell when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/cornered-boris-johnson-suffers-triple-commons-defeat\">not even his own MPs</a> trust him.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>One of the other great pleasures of going on holiday is the chance to sit down and read a book \u2013 The Great Romantic, Duncan Hamilton\u2019s biography of the Guardian cricket and music writer Neville Cardus, was an utter joy. I also love wandering around bookshops in the US to check out how different their bestseller charts are from ours in the UK. Apart from the usual rash of How to Get On in Business and Make a Fortune books, what struck me from going to Barnes &amp; Noble was the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/12/dogs-tales-and-meowmoirs-the-irresistible-rise-of-endearing-animal-books\">titles about heroic dogs</a> that were in its top 20. I counted at least three. There was The Art of Racing in the Rain: Meet the Dog who will Show the World how to be Human, the story of how a pooch brought a family together and turned a bloke into a racing driver. There was also A Dog\u2019s Journeyabout a pit bull mix who gets lost, wanders round a bit and then comes home, and A Dog\u2019s Purpose about a dog that teaches people to be nicer to each other. I wondered if it might catch on over here and if I might be able to cash in with a book about my own dog, Herbert Hound. Though it might have to be quite short. I can\u2019t see much film tie-in potential in the story of how he had such a good time staying with our friends Kim and Sarah while we were away \u2013 they were happy to throw him a ball for hours on end, even though his retrieval success rate is only one in three \u2013 that he sulked for a week when he got back home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"556b32617ba6da8f320b06ce9e4bf641f4b89a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/556b32617ba6da8f320b06ce9e4bf641f4b89a66/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson's new dog\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dog: \u2018I hope they\u2019ve agreed a prenup.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>It also appears to be sod\u2019s law that I managed to miss one of England\u2019s greatest finishes to a Test match since 1981 and have come home to find the cricket team has reverted to playing as badly as it did before I left.

I complained to a steward but he just shrugged and said he hadn\u2019t seen anything. My observation that preventing these kinds of incidents was the whole reason he was there was met with a blank stare. Not so long ago I looked forward to sport as a release \u2013 time out from myself \u2013 but now the bit I increasingly enjoy the most is the anticipation before the game has started, and I\u2019m beginning to wonder if it\u2019s every bit as bad for my mental health as Brexit. I read a report recently that pessimists have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/optimism-may-hold-secret-to-longer-life-study-suggests\">much shorter life expectancy</a> than optimists.

Not so long ago I looked forward to sport as a release \u2013 time out from myself \u2013 but now the bit I increasingly enjoy the most is the anticipation before the game has started, and I\u2019m beginning to wonder if it\u2019s every bit as bad for my mental health as Brexit. I read a report recently that pessimists have a much shorter life expectancy than optimists. In which case, I suspect I am already on borrowed time.

There was no way I\u2019d be taken to see it again, home video was not a thing, so poring over the book, which I have still, was my only way of reliving this amazing, wondrous story. I later learned that although Lucas had the byline, the book \u2013 which hadn\u2019t yet earned the title A New Hope \u2013 was actually written by <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alan_Dean_Foster\">Alan Dean Foster</a>, the undisputed king of novelisations in the 70s and 80s. Dicks and Foster took up the most space on my childhood bookshelves, the latter writing book versions of a string of blockbusters: Alien, Terminator, The Black Hole, Clash of the Titans, The Last Starfighter, Star Trek: The Motion Picture \u2026 so when my daughter bought the novelisation of Star Wars: The Force Awakens three years ago, I had a weird frisson to see Foster\u2019s name again.</p> <p>Novelisations have traditionally served the geekier end of pop culture, where merchandise, collectibles and complete sets are more valued than among aficionados of, say, Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar. (There might be a novelisation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volver\">Volver</a> out there.) But it is curious that they survived home video, never mind streaming. They\u2019re strange beasts, anyway; we\u2019ve seen the movie, we know how it ends, we know who lives or dies \u2013 so why bother putting it all on the page?</p> <p>Because: the best novelisation writers add depth, backstory and extra dimensions to what we see on the screen, flesh out ideas and sub-plots that are wrapped up in a pithy one-liner in the movie, or end up on the cutting-room floor. They can enrich fictional universes \u2013 as with The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, which began life on the radio, and Neil Gaiman\u2019s Neverwhere, written after the TV series.</p> <p>Gaiman was one of many writers who credit Dicks\u2019s Doctor Who adaptations with firing their own literary ambitions, saying he had decided at 11 that he would one day write a Who episode himself (he did) because Dicks had shown him how. <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2013919/adam-christopher\">Adam Christopher</a>, author of a Stranger Things novel, has said novelisations \u201cinstilled a love and understanding of story in me\u201d. So there was no question about his future career: \u201cI wanted to be a writer like Terrance Dicks.\u201d</p> <p>Novelisations are a springboard for both writers and readers \u2013 sometimes in surprising ways. Aged 12, I bought the novelisation of Blade Runner, not knowing that the book with Harrison Ford\u2019s Deckard on the cover was actually Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? I was confused because it bore little relation to the film I\u2019d watched, but also intrigued. I\u2019d never heard of Philip K Dick, but it led me to find out more. It turned out he wasn\u2019t a relation to the Dicks already taking up so much space on my bookshelf, but I didn\u2019t hold it against him.</p>",

(There might be a novelisation of Volver out there.) But it is curious that they survived home video, never mind streaming. They\u2019re strange beasts, anyway; we\u2019ve seen the movie, we know how it ends, we know who lives or dies \u2013 so why bother putting it all on the page? Because: the best novelisation writers add depth, backstory and extra dimensions to what we see on the screen, flesh out ideas and sub-plots that are wrapped up in a pithy one-liner in the movie, or end up on the cutting-room floor. They can enrich fictional universes \u2013 as with The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, which began life on the radio, and Neil Gaiman\u2019s Neverwhere, written after the TV series. Gaiman was one of many writers who credit Dicks\u2019s Doctor Who adaptations with firing their own literary ambitions, saying he had decided at 11 that he would one day write a Who episode himself (he did) because Dicks had shown him how. Adam Christopher, author of a Stranger Things novel, has said novelisations \u201cinstilled a love and understanding of story in me\u201d. So there was no question about his future career: \u201cI wanted to be a writer like Terrance Dicks.\u201d Novelisations are a springboard for both writers and readers \u2013 sometimes in surprising ways. Aged 12, I bought the novelisation of Blade Runner, not knowing that the book with Harrison Ford\u2019s Deckard on the cover was actually Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? I was confused because it bore little relation to the film I\u2019d watched, but also intrigued. I\u2019d never heard of Philip K Dick, but it led me to find out more. It turned out he wasn\u2019t a relation to the Dicks already taking up so much space on my bookshelf, but I didn\u2019t hold it against him.",

      "bodyText": "Netflix and Amazon almost doubled the amount spent on British-made TV shows last year to \u00a3280m as making big-budget shows such as The Crown and Good Omens drove the UK production sector to a record high. The filming spree helped drive the sector to more than \u00a33bn in annual revenues for the first time, according to Pact, the body that represents UK independent TV production companies. The emergence of online streaming has added a significant income boost to the industry, even taking on some shows that began on the domestic airwaves, such as Channel 4\u2019s Black Mirror, which is now a major Netflix series. Netflix and Amazon led an 87% increase in spend by overseas on-demand services from \u00a3150m in 2017 to nearly \u00a3300m, with Netflix in particular ramping up its rate of British-made shows. In recent years Netflix and Amazon have emerged as major contributors to a domestic film and TV production industry whose main pillars were broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky, as well as the Hollywood film studios. \u201cIt is boom time for British production,\u201d said Kate Harwood of Euston Films, which has made shows for US streaming service Hulu and recently made Dublin Murders with the BBC and US network Starz. Harwood added that the US tech duo were being supplemented by new players such as Apple and Disney, which is launching its own streaming platform. \u201cThe rise of Netflix and Amazon represents a tremendous period of opportunity to tell a huge range of stories with many different outlets. They were stage one. Now we also have Apple, Disney+ and other players including Starzplay and Hulu all potentially looking to British producers for content. It is a tremendous period of opportunity.\u201d The spending boom from Netflix and Amazon has put the squeeze on studio space to shoot shows and films. In July, Netflix, which made more than 40 productions in the UK last year, including Top Boy, struck a deal to take over Shepperton Studios as a permanent production base to enable it to keep a smooth flow of TV shows and films. The shortage of filming space has led some broadcasters to seek creative solutions with the emergence of \u201cpop-up\u201d studio sites. ITV uses a former military airbase in Yorkshire to film the hit drama Victoria and a converted carpet warehouse in Neasden, north-west London, was used as the filming base for another ITV production, Mr Selfridge. A strategy of providing a continual pipeline of new content has fuelled the rapid growth of Netflix, which has 151 million global subscribers, with 11 million in the UK, and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, which has 85 million subscribers worldwide and more than 8 million in the UK. The UK TV production sector is hoping for another fillip as Disney ramps up spending on programming for its new service, which includes the $100m Star Wars series The Mandalorian, which is to launch on 12 November. Disney is committing billions to make Disney+ a success in its effort to become a third global streaming giant alongside Netflix and Amazon, which will spend about a combined $20bn on making and licensing TV shows and films this year. The Pact report also highlights the booming popularity of British-made shows in international markets as sales of programmes such as The Bodyguard, The Cry, Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders hit \u00a3214m. Total international revenues, which include global programme sales as well as the money spent by overseas broadcasters making shows in the UK, hit a record \u00a3962m last year. International revenues have grown more than 90% since 2013. \u201cThese figures show that there is a huge international market looking for quality British content,\u201d said Sara Geater, the chair of Pact. Amazon, which has produced UK hits including The Grand Tour, and Netflix have rapidly grown to account for 40% of the total \u00a3704m spent on UK commissions by all overseas broadcasters. According to Pact, the \u00a3280m spent by Netflix and Amazon last year is 12% of the total \u00a32.3bn spent on making shows using UK producers by domestic TV companies such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky, as well as international players. In 2017 the US streaming services accounted for 7% of total programme commissioning spend.",

Now, I cook.</p> <p>These recipes are the kind I make on a Sunday with leftovers on purpose that I\u2019ll be able to use a few ways throughout the week, to make this return a little smoother. The mole is the kind of recipe which takes a bit of love, but ends up with the most rich, rounded and deeply fruity chilli sauce, which you can use to flavour roast veg, beans in tacos, burritos or as a traditional mole stew. The homemade flour tortillas work perfectly with the mole, but can also be heated up through the week.</p> <h2>Ancho chilli and peanut mole</h2> <p>This recipe makes four portions of the mole sauce: one to use in the recipe with the roast veg, and three to store in the fridge or freezer to use for a quick-from-the-freezer dinner (ideas below).</p> <p>Whole, dried ancho chillies are available from most supermarkets in the spice section.

Remove the chillies from the pan, put in a bowl of boiling water and soak for 20 minutes \u2013 if you are using dried red chilli flakes instead, just toast them (there\u2019s no need to soak).</p> <p>Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then add the onion, garlic, tomatoes and a good pinch of salt. Turn down the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the skins on the tomatoes start to come away and the onions are soft. Drain (retaining the chilli water), and put the solids in a high-speed blender with 200ml of the saved water and the chipotle paste. Blend really smooth, then, while still warm, add the chocolate and stir to melt. Set aside.</p> <p>Toast the nuts, pumpkin seeds, cumin seeds and raisins in the same pan you toasted the ancho chilli in: you want them to be golden and well-toasted, so don\u2019t be afraid to take them a little further than you usually would. Add the sesame seeds for the last few minutes. of toasting Add all of this to the paste in the blender, then tip in the stock and a good pinch of salt.

Put all the veg except the corn,In a roasting tray, add cutting any large potatoes in half in a large roasting tray. Add a good glug of olive oil, five tablespoons of the mole and sauce season, then give everything a good mix with your hands so it\u2019s all coated in the lovely smokey sauce. Roast in the oven for 35 minutes, adding the corn halfway and giving the tray a shake, until the veg is soft and the corn a little crisp. Gently heat the mole, then add a few spoonfuls of the silky sauce in to the bottom of each bowl. Top with the roast veg, charred corn, a little fresh coriander, tortillas and a squeeze of lime. Store any leftover sauce in the fridge for a week, or freeze in three portions for later (it will last in the freezer for up to three months).</p> <h2>Easy flour tortillas</h2> <p>Prep <strong>30 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>20 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>8 tortillas</strong></p> <p><strong>400g spelt or plain flour</strong><br><strong>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp salt </strong><br><strong>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil </strong><br><strong>250ml lukewarm water</strong></p> <p>Put the flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a large bowl.

Add a little more water if you think the dough is too dry \u2013 it should feel light and slightly wet before kneading.</p> <p>Tip on to a floured surface and knead for a few minutes, adding a little more flour if needed, until soft, then divide the mix into 10 balls. Roll each ball out into thin circles, about 2mm thick, using a little more flour to stop them sticking to the rolling pin. In a large frying pan, dry-fry each tortilla for about a minute on each side, until slightly charred and toasted.</p> <p>Keep warm in a tea towel while you make the rest.

      "bodyText": "The long, easy days of summer are all but behind us; we\u2019re heading quickly into autumn and back to the day-to-day. For some, it\u2019s a welcome return to routine, but for me, someone who spends their life trying to side-step routine, it\u2019s always a bit of a downer. When I was a kid, my mum would soften the blow with a new pencil case or lunchbox. Now, I cook. These recipes are the kind I make on a Sunday with leftovers on purpose that I\u2019ll be able to use a few ways throughout the week, to make this return a little smoother. The mole is the kind of recipe which takes a bit of love, but ends up with the most rich, rounded and deeply fruity chilli sauce, which you can use to flavour roast veg, beans in tacos, burritos or as a traditional mole stew. The homemade flour tortillas work perfectly with the mole, but can also be heated up through the week. Ancho chilli and peanut mole This recipe makes four portions of the mole sauce: one to use in the recipe with the roast veg, and three to store in the fridge or freezer to use for a quick-from-the-freezer dinner (ideas below). Whole, dried ancho chillies are available from most supermarkets in the spice section. If you can\u2019t get your hands on them, you could use a heaped teaspoon of dried chilli flakes instead. Prep 15 min Soak 20 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 (plus extra sauceleftover mole sauce for three more dinners) For the mole 4 dried ancho chillies, seeds and stems removed, or 1 heaped tsp dried chilli flakes 1 onion, peeled and quartered 3 garlic cloves, peeled 3 vine tomatoes Flaky salt 2 tbsp chipotle paste 60g dark chocolate (70%), broken into squares 75g peanuts 75g almonds 50g pumpkin seeds 1 tsp cumin seeds 75g raisins 25g sesame seeds 750ml vegetable stock For the roast veg 750g new potatoes, larger ones cut in half 400g banana shallots, peeled and halved \u00bd butternut squash (about 500g), cut into large chunks 2 corn on the cob, kernels cut from the cob Olive oil To serve Fresh coriander Tortillas Juice of 1 lime Remove the seeds and stems from the dried ancho chillies, then Lightly toast the chillies in a dry frying pan, being careful not to burn them. Remove the chillies from the pan, put in a bowl of boiling water and soak for 20 minutes \u2013 if you are using dried red chilli flakes instead, just toast them (there\u2019s no need to soak). Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then add the onion, garlic, tomatoes and a good pinch of salt. Turn down the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the skins on the tomatoes start to come away and the onions are soft. Drain (retaining the chilli water), and put the solids in a high-speed blender with 200ml of the saved water and the chipotle paste. Blend really smooth, then, while still warm, add the chocolate and stir to melt. Set aside. Toast the nuts, pumpkin seeds, cumin seeds and raisins in the same pan you toasted the ancho chilli in: you want them to be golden and well-toasted, so don\u2019t be afraid to take them a little further than you usually would. Add the sesame seeds for the last few minutes. of toasting Add all of this to the paste in the blender, then tip in the stock and a good pinch of salt. Blend smooth and silky, then empty into a large saucepan \u2013add a little more stock, if you want it looser. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7. Put all the veg except the corn,In a roasting tray, add cutting any large potatoes in half in a large roasting tray. Add a good glug of olive oil, five tablespoons of the mole and sauce season, then give everything a good mix with your hands so it\u2019s all coated in the lovely smokey sauce. Roast in the oven for 35 minutes, adding the corn halfway and giving the tray a shake, until the veg is soft and the corn a little crisp. Gently heat the mole, then add a few spoonfuls of the silky sauce in to the bottom of each bowl. Top with the roast veg, charred corn, a little fresh coriander, tortillas and a squeeze of lime. Store any leftover sauce in the fridge for a week, or freeze in three portions for later (it will last in the freezer for up to three months). Easy flour tortillas Prep 30 min Cook 20 min Makes 8 tortillas 400g spelt or plain flour 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) \u00bd tsp salt 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 250ml lukewarm water Put the flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a large bowl. Add the oil and water a little at a time, and mix until it comes together into a dough. Add a little more water if you think the dough is too dry \u2013 it should feel light and slightly wet before kneading. Tip on to a floured surface and knead for a few minutes, adding a little more flour if needed, until soft, then divide the mix into 10 balls. Roll each ball out into thin circles, about 2mm thick, using a little more flour to stop them sticking to the rolling pin. In a large frying pan, dry-fry each tortilla for about a minute on each side, until slightly charred and toasted. Keep warm in a tea towel while you make the rest. Serve warm, or leave to cool, wrap in clingfilm, then freeze and warm in the oven when you want one. How to use your mole sauce \u2022 In a saucepan, stir one portion of the sauce with a tin of drained beans (black or pinto beans are best). Serve on the warmed tortillas with a tomato salsa and some chilli sauce. \u2022 Spoon a portion of the sauce over a tray of veg, add a little oil, toss well to coat, then roast and serve in wraps, or with rice. \u2022 Use as a sauce for enchiladas or in burritos. \u2022 Stir into fried rice with vegetables for a quick leftovers dinner.",

But, while freezing is a good way to preserve the season, it all depends on the type and condition of the fruit you\u2019re using. \u201cJam is the hardest preserve to make, because it relies on a chemical reaction to get a set,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/17/four-summer-jam-recipes-kylee-newton-berry-marmalade\" title=\"\">Kylee Newton</a>, owner of Newton &amp; Pott and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/modern-preserver.html\" title=\"\">The Modern Preserver</a>. \u201cI would stick to freezing berries and rhubarb, and I wouldn\u2019t freeze citrus fruit as it\u2019s all just juice.\u201d If you\u2019re punting for apples, Newton blends the pulp before freezing. </p> <p>Jam tastes best using freshly picked fruits that are not too ripe. \u201cFrozen fruit can be used very successfully,\u201d says Pam Corbin, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pam-the-jam-9781408884492.html\" title=\"\">Pam the Jam</a>: The Book of Preserves, who recommends buying from britishfrozenfruits.co.uk. \u201cHowever, if the fruit is wet, or over-ripe, and then frozen, this may result in runny jam.\u201d</p> <p>Fruit secured, do you defrost? This is where the camp splits: \u201cGenerally, you don\u2019t, and certainly not for raspberries, strawberries or soft-skinned fruits,\u201d Corbin says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to get the sugar on to them quickly so they hold their shape and to draw out the juices.\u201d Freezing, Corbin says, breaks down the skin tissue, so when it comes to gooseberries and plums, she heats them gently to soften the skins, while blackberries, raspberries, strawberries and apricots are left to macerate with sugar for half an hour. Newton does defrost, and advises against adding any extra water (frozen fruit retains enough), even if the recipe calls for it. If you\u2019re mixing fresh and frozen fruit, the bulk of it should be frozen. \u201cIf I want whole bits of fruit in my jam, I cook down the frozen fruit first, bring it to a nice, bubbly heat \u2013 making sure it\u2019s not sticking on the bottom \u2013 add the sugar, which should dissolve quickly, and then the unfrozen fruit.\u201d </p> <p>If you\u2019re struggling to set your jam, it\u2019s most likely down to the cooking: \u201cIf you\u2019re getting a thick, syrupy mass, then you\u2019re cooking it for too long and missing the setting point,\u201d Corbin says. \u201cI would much prefer undercooked jam, because you can always redeem it by boiling for a couple more minutes.\u201d Besides opting for higher-pectin fruit, Corbin suggests (members of the WI, look away now) trying jam sugar, or a combination of jam and ordinary sugar. Her optimum temperature for setting is 104.5C. \u201cOnce you get there, the heat increases by the second, so err on the lower side: I always tell people that jam sets in the jar, not in the pan.\u201d Corbin uses the gel (or wrinkle) test: \u201cYou\u2019re looking for what I call a rhinoceros skin.\u201d If it reaches setting point in 30 seconds on the plate, you\u2019re there. The level of pectin in fruit becomes weaker over time, so Newton waits for the bubble change, from rolling boil to ploppy: \u201cAs the pectin reacts and wants to set, the bubbles find it harder to get through: At the beginning, you want to get that fast, rolling boil, then, as it gets heavier and ploppier, turn the heat off and do the wrinkle test.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping jam at a high temperature is key: \u201cIt gets spitty and nasty \u2013 it\u2019s like beekeeping: you\u2019re going to get stung.\u201d</p> <p>You want to get to setting point as quickly as possible \u2013 the longer you leave it, the more likely the fruits will turn to sugars and become super-sweet. \u201cIt is a fine line,\u201d Newton warns. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to stick to the bottom and burn, but you also don\u2019t want to stir it so much that a lot of air gets in and cools it down.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

      "bodyText": "Top Boy Sad lad rapper Drake saved writer Ronan Bennett\u2019s east London drama from cancellation with this Netflix revival. With the move from Channel 4 comes a host of new stars to add to Ashley Walters\u2019s titular drug-dealing role, including MCs Dave and Little Simz. The acting is muted and the story is brutal, engaging and, just sometimes, hopeful. From Friday 13 September, Netflix The Open Ears Project Classical music can be an acquired taste, but with this new podcast from former BBC presenter Clemency Burton-Hill, she aims to break down barriers and get everyone involved. The daily episodes feature celebs and regular New Yorkers introducing their favourite pieces. Podcast State of the Union Nick Hornby\u2019s micro-form series (10 episodes running to 10 minutes each) is a tiny format for a big topic: the breakdown of a marriage. Chris O\u2019Dowd and Rosamund Pike star as the titular couple, dragging themselves through weekly couples\u2019 counselling. Sunday 8 September, 10pm, BBC Two Strictly Come Dancing Launch Show 2019 It\u2019s hard to believe that our screens have been graced with the kitsch sight of B-list celebs waltzing their way into our hearts for the past 15 years, but here we are with the 17th series of Strictly on the horizon, featuring new judge Motsi Mabuse and the blond one from Made in Chelsea, Jamie Laing, among others. Saturday 7 September, 7.10pm, BBC One Treasure Island With Bear Grylls There seems to be no limit to the trauma Bear Grylls will put his new reality show\u2019s contestants through: marooning them on an island, having them fend for themselves and then parachuting in bags of cash for them to fight over. A piratical romp. Sunday 8 September, 9pm, Channel 4 Temple Mark Strong stars in a new Sky original about an illicit surgery operating in the murky depths of the London underground. Daniel Milton (Strong) wants to do good but is increasingly compromised by his dodgy clientele. Based on the Norwegian series Valkyrien, the show looks and feels like Strong\u2019s previous small-screen outing Low Winter Sun: brimful of bloody violence, bravado and rhythmic swearing. Friday 13 September, 9pm, Sky One Brexitcast Fans of the podcast will know that the hosts of Brexitcast don\u2019t take themselves too seriously. Now a TV series, the show will continue to offer an insiders\u2019 take on the wild west of Brexit, interspersed with low-key, geeky humour. Whether they can maintain the playful feel will be the key to their success. Thursday 12 September, 11.35pm, BBC One The Spy Sacha Baron Cohen takes a dramatic turn as real-life Israeli spy Eli Cohen in this new miniseries on Syrian espionage in the 1960s. The eventual capture of Cohen looms over the show, giving it a tense, terse feel throughout, with the weight of expectation laden on Sacha\u2019s face. He may be moustachioed once more but there is no Borat in sight. Available now, Netflix The Passenger Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s 1975 existential drama is set in war-torn north Africa, where Jack Nicholson\u2019s burnt-out reporter David Locke impulsively swaps identities with an Englishman he discovers dead in the hotel room next door. The thriller elements are incidental when the burning question is: why did he do it? It\u2019s an enigma wrapped in a mystery. Monday 9 September, 1.40am, Talking Pictures TV Undone BoJack Horseman creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg brings a new, dark drama about a woman who starts to see visions of her dead father and travel through time after a car crash. Animated in lifelike rotoscope and starring Bob Odenkirk as the dad, it\u2019s an inventive, mind-bending watch that questions our reality and the nature of grief. From Friday 13 September, Amazon Prime Video",

The US and UK supply the bombs, the planes that drop the bombs, training for the pilots, and the spare parts and maintenance that keep the planes in the sky. Any idea that these complex weapons systems would simply be replaced by Russia or China were Britain to refuse to provide this support is a myth.

      "bodyText": "Nothing can diminish the threat of a disorderly Brexit, or the significance of Boris Johnson\u2019s recent anti-democratic prorogation of parliament. That those stories lead the news is no surprise. But when our government provides crucial support to a campaign of indiscriminate killing in Yemen that has claimed the lives of thousands of people, and this is treated as a footnote in our politics rather than a national scandal, it is plain that something has gone badly wrong. This week a report by UN experts warned that Britain could be complicit in war crimes through its arming of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervening in Yemen\u2019s civil conflict. The report is the latest in a long line from the UN and the world\u2019s most respected NGOs documenting a consistent pattern of violations. The experts note that leading arms providers like the UK \u201chave a specific influence\u201d on the belligerents \u201cand may be held responsible for providing aid or assistance for the commission of international law violations\u201d. About 100,000 people have met violent deaths since March 2015, and the blockade imposed by the Saudi-UAE coalition is the primary cause of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, pushing millions to the brink of famine. Save the Children estimates that 85,000 infants have died from starvation or preventable disease. The UN experts raise the real possibility that starvation is being employed as a war tactic. British complicity in that ought to be unthinkable. Aerial bombing by the Saudis \u2013 frequently indiscriminate \u2013 is responsible for most of the civilian deaths, and that bombing is completely dependent on British and American support. The US and UK supply the bombs, the planes that drop the bombs, training for the pilots, and the spare parts and maintenance that keep the planes in the sky. Any idea that these complex weapons systems would simply be replaced by Russia or China were Britain to refuse to provide this support is a myth. The reality is that Washington and London could have stopped the Saudis\u2019 war any time they liked. This indefensible situation has continued for so long partly because it has not received a level of political attention commensurate with the magnitude of the catastrophe. Our government is to blame for its own policies, but the failure to put sufficient pressure on it to end those policies is something the rest of us are responsible for. Politicians of the centre, for example, are never shy of flaunting their supposed internationalist credentials, but many of these same figures either support or have nothing to say about British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

The media also have questions to answer. Academic observers like myself owe a debt to brave journalists like Iona Craig, Bel Trew, Nawal al-Maghafi and Orla Guerin, whose reporting from Yemen is invaluable to our research.

      "bodyText": "The former defence secretary Michael Fallon has warned the UK prime minister that he risks driving remain supporters into the hands of the opposition, as he confirmed he would not be standing as a candidate at the next election. Fallon, a remain supporter who backed Boris Johnson in the Tory leadership race, also called for the 21 rebel MPs who had the Conservative whip removed, to be allowed to appeal against the decision. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Fallon insisted his decision not to fight his Sevenoaks seat at the election had \u201cnothing to do with Brexit\u201d and offered muted support for Johnson. But underlining backbench disquiet at the removal of the whip from rebels, including many former cabinet ministers, Fallon said: \u201cI would hope there would be some kind of appeal mechanism, so they can get the chance to state their case.\u201d He said the treatment of the rebels who voted for a joint party bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit risked alienating remain voters. Fallon said: \u201cI worry that it sends the wrong message to remainers, particularly in my party. Some 5 million Conservatives must have voted remain, I think we\u2019ve got to be very careful not to drive them into the hands of remainer parties, like the Liberal Democrats in England, or the Scottish nationalists in Scotland.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are doing one of the biggest things we\u2019ve ever done in this country since the second world war, and it\u2019s very important that we do try to take those who voted remain \u2013 and nearly half the country voted remain \u2013 with us.\u201d Fallon who resigned as defence secretary in 2017 after admitting that his behaviour towards women in the past had \u201cfallen short\u201d, said on his own future: \u201cI was intending to stand down at the end of this parliament which I expected in a couple of years. It looks now as if there\u2019s going to be an election and I don\u2019t want to commit again for what could be another five years.\u201d He added he hoped Johnson could negotiate a new deal with the EU to ensure an orderly exit from the bloc: \u201cThere are important talks taking place in Dublin on Monday, there is still time to find a way through this with some kind of compromise agreement and it is very important, I think that those who voted remain, you know, do feel that they\u2019re wanted with us on this voyage into a new future.\u201d On Johnson\u2019s character and tactics he said: \u201cI voted for somebody who would bring fresh energy and ambition to this Brexit process and bring it to an end. There are a lot of people who may have voted leave or remain who do now want this brought to an end. And I think the overall strategy of setting a final date at the end of October is the right one.\u201d",

Undeniably. The <a href=\"https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/images/file/disciplinare%202008%20UK.pdf\">Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana</a> [pdf] directs that a pizza should be no thicker than 4mm at its centre and, in its airy, chewy elasticity, the Neapolitan base is famed for its easy digestibility. It is a revelation, despite some objecting to Nea-pizza on the basis that a slice cannot support its own weight. Such naysayers are more than welcome to continue to eat the many pizzas available, from Brooklyn to Bolton, that feature bases as sturdy and appetising as cardboard. It leaves more gloriously limp, drooping Neapolitan pizza for the rest of us.</p> <p>There is, however, one growing problem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/may/23/how-to-eat-pizza\">in this buffalo mozzarella-covered sphere</a>, and that is a sudden voguish tendency \u2013 How To Eat is looking at you, the otherwise impeccable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/06/this-weeks-food-and-drink\">Honest Crust</a> in Manchester \u2013 to send Neapolitan pizzas out from the kitchen unsliced. Not just in restaurants, but in more chaotic street food environments, too. This leaves you in the unfortunate position of having to eat your pizza with a knife and fork or tear it by hand, which seems a barbaric way to treat such a precious item.</p> <p>It is authentic, apparently. But does that make it right? Let How to Eat (HTE) cut to the chase on the Neapolitan slice.</p> <p><strong>On knives, forks and pre-slicing \u2026</strong></p> <p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.pizzapilgrims.co.uk/2017/10/how-to-eat-our-pizza/\">announces Pizza Pilgrims\u2019 website</a>, \u201ceating pizza with a knife and fork is a very Italian way to do things \u2013 so don\u2019t feel like this is any kind of cop-out.\u201d Indeed, there are those who see the New York \u201cslice\u201d and the habit that arose from that of pre-slicing whole pizzas in restaurants as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/how-to-eat-pizza-italy-new-york-neapolitan-a7360651.html\">an Italian-American invention</a>, yet another strand of US cultural imperialism alien in Italy itself. Most Italian sources agree that in restaurants, <a href=\"http://www.livinginitalian.com/food/2016/9/22/eat-pizza-naples\">cutlery should be used</a> to eat your (whole, unsliced) pizza, not your hands.</p> <p>That may seem weird for something we think of as street food, but it is not nearly as bizarre as the <a href=\"https://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/food/articles/2017/february/09/how-to-eat-pizza-like-a-neapolitan/\">genuinely WTF method</a> used in Naples by those eating pizza on the street. <em>Pizza a portafoglio</em>, literally wallet pizza, involves folding your pizza in half and then quarters, so you can walk along eating your newly portable pizza like a crepe or kebab \u2013 held out away from your shirtfront, warn its advocates. This (what \u2026 DIY calzone?) was the original way to enjoy this working-class street food, traditionalists insist.</p> <p>But you can have too much tradition, HTE finds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"340b42e8a475628db2975d56b26c0032ed916d4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/340b42e8a475628db2975d56b26c0032ed916d4e/0_160_2614_1568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Folded Neapolitan-style pizza in hand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The portafoglio method: traditional, maybe \u2013 but should pizza really be eaten while walking?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mathess/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, you should not be walking when eating a pizza of this quality. Pause and enjoy it properly in a leisurely manner, whether sat in a bus stop or at a restaurant table. Second, the portafoglio method (music to the ears of those who dismiss pizza as cheese on toast, no more than an open sandwich with good PR) surely gives you<em> </em>far too much of everything in every four-layer bite. Particularly at the pizza\u2019s doughy edges. Flavourful as a good Neapolitan base is, who wants to eat four layers of undressed rim in one mouthful? That would be hideous. True, you can avoid that by inverting the portafoglio triangle and eating it from the tip down \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftQqoSEj_TI\">as some do </a>\u2013 but does that not risk the contents falling out of the pizza\u2019s bottom as you move? It must.</p> <p>Broken as Britain is in so many other ways, we should take pride in the fact that we have evolved a superior third way beyond cutlery or this portafoglio fallacy, by simply pre-cutting Neapolitan pizzas and then eating them slice by slice, by hand. A big part of the joy of this product is precisely how tactile it is. You want to get hands-on with your pizza. You want to feel that hot, springy crust yielding between your fingers. You want to get up close and personal with each slice \u2013 its aroma, its vivid colours \u2013 rather than eating it at one prim remove with cutlery or wolfing it down as a fat, folded wodge of indistinguishable ballast.</p> <p><strong>The fold</strong></p> <p>You <em>must </em>fold a Neapolitan pizza slice. Otherwise it is clearly going to flop and loll like a parched dog\u2019s tongue, and all your toppings will drop off. Puffed-up and <a href=\"https://firstwefeast.com/eat/2015/10/pizza-slang-101\">leopard-spotted</a>, a slice of Neapolitan pizza may be beautiful, but it has all the structural integrity of a slinky.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-eat-a-slice-of-pizza\">The crimp</a>, that half-hearted inversion of your slice, is not sufficient. That gully you create down the middle of your slice will not reinforce it. Conversely, Pizza Pilgrims\u2019 advice to cut the pizza into four unmanageably large slices then fold each slice\u2019s wings in by one-third to create a \u201cpizza boat\u201d is an over-engineered solution to a self-inflicted problem.</p> <p>Instead, cut your pizza into six smaller sections so that you only need to fold each slice once, pinching the outer edges of the crust together to create, in essence, a folded sandwich from each slice. One that, if your pizza is a good one (its high-quality ingredients thinly sliced and evenly distributed, not left in a mountainous jumble), should mean you get a little bit of every ingredient in each bite.</p> <p>If the centre of your pizza is extra-sloppy \u2013 and frequently it will be (that moist or <em>umido </em>centre is prized) \u2013 then you should also fold the tip of each slice in on itself by about 1cm. That stops sauce spraying hither and tither, and flipping the tip also means each slice starts with an extra thick, juicy gobbet of pure pizza pleasure.</p> <p>It also helps you retain your dignity as a human being. By flipping the tip you are not left a.) chasing that dangling, trembling tip around like some fairground game, or b.) getting your head under each high-held slice and eating it from the tip up, feeding it down your throat like a pelican. A process that, after a few drinks, often leads to you smearing it all over your face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c1321e57018eccab6bf87fb9e6c7c22f330335d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c1321e57018eccab6bf87fb9e6c7c22f330335d/0_245_5197_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neapolitan-style pizza in front of pizza oven\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slice of Neapolitan pizza may be beautiful, but it has all the structural integrity of a slinky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony French/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The crust</strong></p> <p>Repeatedly, you see the argument advanced that Neapolitan pizza is unsuitable for slicing because it is so wet. If it is pre-cut, its molten topping will simply slide away. True, there may be spillages, ooze, a certain magma flow. But surely that is what the <em>cornicione</em>, that swollen outer crust, is for? Swiping through any rogue tomato, oil or mozzarella as you eat?</p> <p>The crust is certainly not to be discarded. In its rule book, the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana stipulates that it \u201cshould deliver the flavour of well-prepared, baked bread\u201d. Glossy and fragrant, the best crust can be eaten on its own or used to mop up the oil from pizza\u2019s ideal starter: a bowl of plump, buttery nocellara olives. (Yes, that is the most middle-class sentence you have ever read and is precisely why, come the revolution, HTE will be first up against the wall.)</p> <p><strong>Additions</strong></p> <p>A good pizza does not need any. The tendency among heavy-handed <em>pizzaiolo</em> to drown already well-lubricated Neapolitan pizzas in a finishing flourish of olive oil is a good illustration of why you should not add more.</p> <p>Similarly, from chilli flakes to freshly cracked black pepper, the common additions offered to pizza customers are likely, in one over-enthusiastic twist of the wrist, to ruin your meal.

      "bodyText": "The rise of Neapolitan-style pizza, soft, pliable and blast-cooked to perfection in under 90 seconds, is the best thing to happen to British food in the past decade. Those slow-proved bases blistered with delicious char, topped with sweet San Marzano tomato pulp and a modest layer of imperious ingredients, are frequently incredible \u2013 the most fun you can have with food at circa \u00a310. From the Dusty Knuckle in Cardiff to Little Furnace in Liverpool, Cal\u2019s Own in Newcastle to Bertha\u2019s in Bristol, How to Eat \u2013 the series isolating the best way to eat our most beloved foods \u2013 salutes this flour-powered vanguard. Is Neapolitan pizza unusually floppy? Undeniably. The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana [pdf] directs that a pizza should be no thicker than 4mm at its centre and, in its airy, chewy elasticity, the Neapolitan base is famed for its easy digestibility. It is a revelation, despite some objecting to Nea-pizza on the basis that a slice cannot support its own weight. Such naysayers are more than welcome to continue to eat the many pizzas available, from Brooklyn to Bolton, that feature bases as sturdy and appetising as cardboard. It leaves more gloriously limp, drooping Neapolitan pizza for the rest of us. There is, however, one growing problem in this buffalo mozzarella-covered sphere, and that is a sudden voguish tendency \u2013 How To Eat is looking at you, the otherwise impeccable Honest Crust in Manchester \u2013 to send Neapolitan pizzas out from the kitchen unsliced. Not just in restaurants, but in more chaotic street food environments, too. This leaves you in the unfortunate position of having to eat your pizza with a knife and fork or tear it by hand, which seems a barbaric way to treat such a precious item. It is authentic, apparently. But does that make it right? Let How to Eat (HTE) cut to the chase on the Neapolitan slice. On knives, forks and pre-slicing \u2026 \u201cFirst things first,\u201d announces Pizza Pilgrims\u2019 website, \u201ceating pizza with a knife and fork is a very Italian way to do things \u2013 so don\u2019t feel like this is any kind of cop-out.\u201d Indeed, there are those who see the New York \u201cslice\u201d and the habit that arose from that of pre-slicing whole pizzas in restaurants as an Italian-American invention, yet another strand of US cultural imperialism alien in Italy itself. Most Italian sources agree that in restaurants, cutlery should be used to eat your (whole, unsliced) pizza, not your hands. That may seem weird for something we think of as street food, but it is not nearly as bizarre as the genuinely WTF method used in Naples by those eating pizza on the street. Pizza a portafoglio, literally wallet pizza, involves folding your pizza in half and then quarters, so you can walk along eating your newly portable pizza like a crepe or kebab \u2013 held out away from your shirtfront, warn its advocates. This (what \u2026 DIY calzone?) was the original way to enjoy this working-class street food, traditionalists insist. But you can have too much tradition, HTE finds. First, you should not be walking when eating a pizza of this quality. Pause and enjoy it properly in a leisurely manner, whether sat in a bus stop or at a restaurant table. Second, the portafoglio method (music to the ears of those who dismiss pizza as cheese on toast, no more than an open sandwich with good PR) surely gives you far too much of everything in every four-layer bite. Particularly at the pizza\u2019s doughy edges. Flavourful as a good Neapolitan base is, who wants to eat four layers of undressed rim in one mouthful? That would be hideous. True, you can avoid that by inverting the portafoglio triangle and eating it from the tip down \u2013 as some do \u2013 but does that not risk the contents falling out of the pizza\u2019s bottom as you move? It must. Broken as Britain is in so many other ways, we should take pride in the fact that we have evolved a superior third way beyond cutlery or this portafoglio fallacy, by simply pre-cutting Neapolitan pizzas and then eating them slice by slice, by hand. A big part of the joy of this product is precisely how tactile it is. You want to get hands-on with your pizza. You want to feel that hot, springy crust yielding between your fingers. You want to get up close and personal with each slice \u2013 its aroma, its vivid colours \u2013 rather than eating it at one prim remove with cutlery or wolfing it down as a fat, folded wodge of indistinguishable ballast. The fold You must fold a Neapolitan pizza slice. Otherwise it is clearly going to flop and loll like a parched dog\u2019s tongue, and all your toppings will drop off. Puffed-up and leopard-spotted, a slice of Neapolitan pizza may be beautiful, but it has all the structural integrity of a slinky. The crimp, that half-hearted inversion of your slice, is not sufficient. That gully you create down the middle of your slice will not reinforce it. Conversely, Pizza Pilgrims\u2019 advice to cut the pizza into four unmanageably large slices then fold each slice\u2019s wings in by one-third to create a \u201cpizza boat\u201d is an over-engineered solution to a self-inflicted problem. Instead, cut your pizza into six smaller sections so that you only need to fold each slice once, pinching the outer edges of the crust together to create, in essence, a folded sandwich from each slice. One that, if your pizza is a good one (its high-quality ingredients thinly sliced and evenly distributed, not left in a mountainous jumble), should mean you get a little bit of every ingredient in each bite. If the centre of your pizza is extra-sloppy \u2013 and frequently it will be (that moist or umido centre is prized) \u2013 then you should also fold the tip of each slice in on itself by about 1cm. That stops sauce spraying hither and tither, and flipping the tip also means each slice starts with an extra thick, juicy gobbet of pure pizza pleasure. It also helps you retain your dignity as a human being. By flipping the tip you are not left a.) chasing that dangling, trembling tip around like some fairground game, or b.) getting your head under each high-held slice and eating it from the tip up, feeding it down your throat like a pelican. A process that, after a few drinks, often leads to you smearing it all over your face. The crust Repeatedly, you see the argument advanced that Neapolitan pizza is unsuitable for slicing because it is so wet. If it is pre-cut, its molten topping will simply slide away. True, there may be spillages, ooze, a certain magma flow. But surely that is what the cornicione, that swollen outer crust, is for? Swiping through any rogue tomato, oil or mozzarella as you eat? The crust is certainly not to be discarded. In its rule book, the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana stipulates that it \u201cshould deliver the flavour of well-prepared, baked bread\u201d. Glossy and fragrant, the best crust can be eaten on its own or used to mop up the oil from pizza\u2019s ideal starter: a bowl of plump, buttery nocellara olives. (Yes, that is the most middle-class sentence you have ever read and is precisely why, come the revolution, HTE will be first up against the wall.) Additions A good pizza does not need any. The tendency among heavy-handed pizzaiolo to drown already well-lubricated Neapolitan pizzas in a finishing flourish of olive oil is a good illustration of why you should not add more. Similarly, from chilli flakes to freshly cracked black pepper, the common additions offered to pizza customers are likely, in one over-enthusiastic twist of the wrist, to ruin your meal. If you are regularly eating Neapolitan-style pizzas whose flavours need punching up, then you need to find a better pizza operation \u2013 someone is slacking in the kitchen. Equipment The dead chill of porcelain kills pizza, causing it to cool too quickly. A wooden pizza board or the classic corrugated-cardboard takeaway box are far superior platforms. Both allow a pizza to breathe, but maintain its core warmth for a suitable duration. Other than that, all you need is a ready supply of paper napkins. Drink Something dry, lightly acidic and gently carbonated to briskly flush the mouth clean during what is a naturally oily meal: good Czech or German pils (Jever, Rothaus Tannenz\u00e4pfle); US-style pale ales; lightly sour, citrusy saisons; sparkling wine, such as a proper secco red lambrusco: dry and complex, very different from the sweet muck of yore, favoured by several pizza experts and enjoying a renaissance. Tread carefully with soft drinks. All that mozzarella and tomato pulp can make pizza a sweet savoury dish, which can become cloying when partnered with cola, lemonade or such. Sparkling water or grapefruit juice heavily watered down with tonic water is preferable. So: Neapolitan-style pizza, how do you eat yours?",

The language of power was, as ever, French: prorogation, parliament, government. The language of the abstract concepts he said the government needed to deal with was Latin: exciting agenda, violent crime, education, infrastructure, economy. He spoke only one sentence from Anglo-Saxon, the language of England before the conquest. It was the sentence where he spoke about a worker being employed to do a job, a hired drudge bound to do something tedious, concrete and essential that nobody would thank her for and was necessary to make the whole thing work. It so happened that this drudge was the monarch. \u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are going to have a Queen\u2019s speech.\u201d</p> <p>At least six centuries have passed since England was trilingual, since the mass of working people spoke a Germanic language called \u201cEnglish\u201d, the nobility spoke a bastardised Norman French and the clergy dealt in Latin.

And the three medieval estates linked to those three languages \u2013 of the worker, the person of power and the cleric \u2013 offer an alternative way of understanding society in the here and now.</p> <p>When, in the first half of the 14th century, the Chester monk Ranulf Higden wrote his history of the world in Latin, he bemoaned the dominance of the French language among the gentry in England.

As well as describing, in English, the death of French as a living language in England, Trevisa sounds the death knell for living Latin by the then radical act of translating a learned work from Latin into English.</p> <p>But neither French nor Latin went away. They seeped into what we call English and made themselves at home, giving the language its fantastical redundancy, creating something half-Germanic, half-Romance. Trilinguality was internalised. Otherwise the Albert Hall would resound to \u201cLand of hope and woolder/Mother of the frith,\u201d and we\u2019d sing \u201cGod beery our gladman Queen\u201d and leave the EU not to take back control but to \u201ctake wield again\u201d. We\u2019re born in English, live, love, wonder, feel and die in English, but we\u2019re conceived, we emerge, exist, touch, desire, doubt, experience, suffer, succeed, fail and perish in French and Latin. The intimate relationship between the three languages is there in the very word \u201crelationship\u201d, a trilingualism love child, \u201crelation\u201d both French and Latin, -ship an Anglo-Saxon suffix. The redundancy is there in the Latin \u201cintimate\u201d, which could just as easily be replaced by the French \u201cclose\u201d or the Anglo-Saxon \u201cnear\u201d.</p> <p>The infusion of French and Latin into English began long before the 14th century, but the mingling was accelerated by one event that struck England in 1348, the single worst thing to happen to humanity in Europe between the last ice age and the current climate emergency: the Black Death, which killed more than half the population. The plague created linguistic change because it forced the diminished classes to make accommodations with one another \u2013 the francophone aristos and the Latinist clerics, in particular, had to befriend the anglophone peasantry whose now scarce labour they depended on. But just as the three languages persist within a single, encompassing English, rather than one tongue being triumphant, so the three estates that spoke them, and the modes of being they represent, linger on in association with those languages.</p> <p>The characteristic idiom of intellectual analysis is still a highly Latinate English. Almost 1,000 years after the Normans took power in England, the language of power (parliament, government, civil service, police, court, judge) the military (army, navy, soldier, battle, campaign) and finance (interest, rent, money, tax, mortgage, asset, property, inheritance) retains a strong French cast. And, though there are thousands of exceptions, and many Norse imports, Anglo-Saxon-derived words still make up the lexis of the everyday of things before they take proper names \u2013 man, woman, child, house, road, star, tree, cloud, bird, head, foot, rain, snow, earth, spade, hammer, spoon.</p> <p>The three estates that used these three languages before the plague don\u2019t map comfortably on to our modern notions of a society trisected into workers, the middle class and the wealthy. In Britain at least, that class division is still real, and conceptually useful, but the persistence in English of that pre-plague linguistic divide points to a subtly different social inheritance. If you break the medieval classes down to the essence of their being you come to worker class, power class and reflective class \u2013 those who work, those who fight and those who pray. Those who fall within the last category, the clerics, frame and deploy the abstract concepts, narratives and rules that purport to offer people meaning, consolation, and a sense of a greater order of things. In this sense, the division of society into workers, clerks and the powerful runs as deep in the 21st century as it did in the 14th.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>For all the outrage of the present, the overwhelming mood is of a discomfort we would not be feeling if we were happy in our group identities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The clerkly class of today is made up of academics, thinktankers, lawyers, writers, many artists, scientists, journalists and students, some comedians and politicians, even some entrepreneurs, as well as actual clerics \u2013 anyone whose sense of self depends on an abstract frame of reference. A revolt of workers and the wealthy and powerful against the middle classes makes rather less sense than a revolt of workers and lords against a clerical class whose idealist, universalist abstractions they find inconvenient, obscure and incompatible with a prosperity they feel is dubiously earned. After all, it happened before, during the Reformation, which showed that when workers and lords unite against the clerics, it doesn\u2019t mean the end of the clerical class, merely their replacement by a new set of clerics.</p> <p>My list of modern members of the clerical class has a Remainer look to it, but to say baldly that Brexit is a revolt of the other estates against the modern post-religious version of the clerks is to make this way of looking at the world sound too much like an alternative version of the Marxist class struggle. It\u2019s a more subtle, personal, drawn-out process than that.</p> <p>When for a novel set in the 14th century I teased English out into three distinct, more or less modern idioms, using Frenchness, Germanicity and Latinness to express aristocratic, peasant and clerical worldviews, I found how naturally the neo-aristocratic French-rich idiom expressed ideas of romantic love. I hadn\u2019t realised how deeply the ancient sense of proprietorship by the powerful over the depiction of love was embedded in literary, that is clerkly, English. What I also found was that Germanic English had its own idiom of love, more urgent and full-on: but of course it does, because it\u2019s all around us, the language of pop, worker art. When you look at the English of hits, it\u2019s startling how Anglo-Saxon success is. \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s Now Or Never\u201d, \u201cMy Heart Will Go On\u201d, \u201c I Want To Hold Your Hand\u201d. Popular songs and stories of love and hurt, of gods, heroes, devils and kings, folksy slogans \u2013 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s the Real Thing\u201d - are what\u2019s left in English of a pre-Norman time when the power language, the abstraction language and the folk language were the same.</p> <p>For all the furious name-calling and outrage of the present, the overwhelming mood is of discomfort, a discomfort we would not be feeling if we were happy in our group identities. I doubt that in their hearts the present-day powerful, which is usually to also say wealthy, would be unhappy to be equated with medieval aristocrats (sometimes they still are aristocrats) but their children yearn for validation by the clerkly world of poets and artists and thinkers. Workers and clerks yearn for the power, at least, of financial freedom, which means no less than the power to command others to do your will.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance\">Behemoth, bully, thief: how the English language is taking over the planet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The greatest identity discomfort is between the workers and the clerks. Each feels as resentful of the idea of being confined to a status \u2013 the powerless worker, the bloodless cleric \u2013 as they are fearful of the direction the world is taking, which is of the merging of workers and clerks into one increasingly educated, increasingly exploited mass. Populism accentuates these fears, heightening such scorn as the workers feel towards the clerks and turning such guilt as the clerks feel in respect of the workers to bitterness \u2013 all to the advantage of the neo-aristocrats of modern global power.</p> <p>And yet we are all in it together; the peasantification of clerkdom goes hand in hand with the replacement of drudge work by machines or by knowledge work \u2013 clerkly work. The danger for exploitative power is that instead of resenting the elision of the boundary between clerks and workers, we embrace it. On the one hand, most people, bound in a system where taxes have been usurped by a burden of private fees, have reason to feel they are both the gatherers of the lords\u2019 crops and the crops themselves; on the other, we have recent examples, in countries such as Egypt and Ukraine, of what happens when the worker class and the clerk class unite against power. In Britain and in the US I hope it would be a gentler and more successful process, but in English we have the terms in triplicate: rise up, rebel, revolt.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To Calais, in Ordinary Time by James Meek is published by Canongate.

We\u2019re born in English, live, love, wonder, feel and die in English, but we\u2019re conceived, we emerge, exist, touch, desire, doubt, experience, suffer, succeed, fail and perish in French and Latin. The intimate relationship between the three languages is there in the very word \u201crelationship\u201d, a trilingualism love child, \u201crelation\u201d both French and Latin, -ship an Anglo-Saxon suffix. The redundancy is there in the Latin \u201cintimate\u201d, which could just as easily be replaced by the French \u201cclose\u201d or the Anglo-Saxon \u201cnear\u201d. The infusion of French and Latin into English began long before the 14th century, but the mingling was accelerated by one event that struck England in 1348, the single worst thing to happen to humanity in Europe between the last ice age and the current climate emergency: the Black Death, which killed more than half the population. The plague created linguistic change because it forced the diminished classes to make accommodations with one another \u2013 the francophone aristos and the Latinist clerics, in particular, had to befriend the anglophone peasantry whose now scarce labour they depended on. But just as the three languages persist within a single, encompassing English, rather than one tongue being triumphant, so the three estates that spoke them, and the modes of being they represent, linger on in association with those languages. The characteristic idiom of intellectual analysis is still a highly Latinate English. Almost 1,000 years after the Normans took power in England, the language of power (parliament, government, civil service, police, court, judge) the military (army, navy, soldier, battle, campaign) and finance (interest, rent, money, tax, mortgage, asset, property, inheritance) retains a strong French cast. And, though there are thousands of exceptions, and many Norse imports, Anglo-Saxon-derived words still make up the lexis of the everyday of things before they take proper names \u2013 man, woman, child, house, road, star, tree, cloud, bird, head, foot, rain, snow, earth, spade, hammer, spoon. The three estates that used these three languages before the plague don\u2019t map comfortably on to our modern notions of a society trisected into workers, the middle class and the wealthy. In Britain at least, that class division is still real, and conceptually useful, but the persistence in English of that pre-plague linguistic divide points to a subtly different social inheritance. If you break the medieval classes down to the essence of their being you come to worker class, power class and reflective class \u2013 those who work, those who fight and those who pray. Those who fall within the last category, the clerics, frame and deploy the abstract concepts, narratives and rules that purport to offer people meaning, consolation, and a sense of a greater order of things. In this sense, the division of society into workers, clerks and the powerful runs as deep in the 21st century as it did in the 14th. The clerkly class of today is made up of academics, thinktankers, lawyers, writers, many artists, scientists, journalists and students, some comedians and politicians, even some entrepreneurs, as well as actual clerics \u2013 anyone whose sense of self depends on an abstract frame of reference. A revolt of workers and the wealthy and powerful against the middle classes makes rather less sense than a revolt of workers and lords against a clerical class whose idealist, universalist abstractions they find inconvenient, obscure and incompatible with a prosperity they feel is dubiously earned. After all, it happened before, during the Reformation, which showed that when workers and lords unite against the clerics, it doesn\u2019t mean the end of the clerical class, merely their replacement by a new set of clerics. My list of modern members of the clerical class has a Remainer look to it, but to say baldly that Brexit is a revolt of the other estates against the modern post-religious version of the clerks is to make this way of looking at the world sound too much like an alternative version of the Marxist class struggle. It\u2019s a more subtle, personal, drawn-out process than that. When for a novel set in the 14th century I teased English out into three distinct, more or less modern idioms, using Frenchness, Germanicity and Latinness to express aristocratic, peasant and clerical worldviews, I found how naturally the neo-aristocratic French-rich idiom expressed ideas of romantic love. I hadn\u2019t realised how deeply the ancient sense of proprietorship by the powerful over the depiction of love was embedded in literary, that is clerkly, English. What I also found was that Germanic English had its own idiom of love, more urgent and full-on: but of course it does, because it\u2019s all around us, the language of pop, worker art. When you look at the English of hits, it\u2019s startling how Anglo-Saxon success is. \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s Now Or Never\u201d, \u201cMy Heart Will Go On\u201d, \u201c I Want To Hold Your Hand\u201d. Popular songs and stories of love and hurt, of gods, heroes, devils and kings, folksy slogans \u2013 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s the Real Thing\u201d - are what\u2019s left in English of a pre-Norman time when the power language, the abstraction language and the folk language were the same. For all the furious name-calling and outrage of the present, the overwhelming mood is of discomfort, a discomfort we would not be feeling if we were happy in our group identities. I doubt that in their hearts the present-day powerful, which is usually to also say wealthy, would be unhappy to be equated with medieval aristocrats (sometimes they still are aristocrats) but their children yearn for validation by the clerkly world of poets and artists and thinkers. Workers and clerks yearn for the power, at least, of financial freedom, which means no less than the power to command others to do your will. The greatest identity discomfort is between the workers and the clerks. Each feels as resentful of the idea of being confined to a status \u2013 the powerless worker, the bloodless cleric \u2013 as they are fearful of the direction the world is taking, which is of the merging of workers and clerks into one increasingly educated, increasingly exploited mass. Populism accentuates these fears, heightening such scorn as the workers feel towards the clerks and turning such guilt as the clerks feel in respect of the workers to bitterness \u2013 all to the advantage of the neo-aristocrats of modern global power. And yet we are all in it together; the peasantification of clerkdom goes hand in hand with the replacement of drudge work by machines or by knowledge work \u2013 clerkly work. The danger for exploitative power is that instead of resenting the elision of the boundary between clerks and workers, we embrace it. On the one hand, most people, bound in a system where taxes have been usurped by a burden of private fees, have reason to feel they are both the gatherers of the lords\u2019 crops and the crops themselves; on the other, we have recent examples, in countries such as Egypt and Ukraine, of what happens when the worker class and the clerk class unite against power. In Britain and in the US I hope it would be a gentler and more successful process, but in English we have the terms in triplicate: rise up, rebel, revolt. \u2022 To Calais, in Ordinary Time by James Meek is published by Canongate.

At least 30 dead after \u2018generational devastation\u2019 in the Bahamas Hurricane Dorian tore up the coast of the Carolinas on Thursday, but spared the south-east US seaboard from the sort of devastation it had visited on the Bahamas, where the death toll of up to 30 is expected to rise. The prime minister, Hubert Minnis, said the storm had caused \u201cgenerational devastation\u201d across Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands, where residents told Oliver Laughland they feared no one would come to their rescue. Storm path. Dorian is expected to remain just off the eastern seaboard of the US on Friday and over the weekend as it moves north towards New England and Nova Scotia. Oakland Ghost Ship fire case ends in acquittal and mistrial Thirty-six people died in the December 2016 fire at the Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland, California, a space that had been illegally rented out as an artists\u2019 commune. On Thursday, the trial of its master tenant, Derick Almena, who had hosted an unlicensed electronic music party at the venue on the night of the blaze, ended in a mistrial, with the jury \u201chopelessly deadlocked\u201d on whether to convict him of involuntary manslaughter. Max Harris, 29, his purported right-hand man, was found not guilty on all charges. Housing crisis. The disaster was one of the deadliest structure fires in US history, highlighting the Bay Area\u2019s housing crisis and devastating its underground arts scene. Many of the the victims were musicians, artists, photographers and other creatives. Kushner\u2019s Middle East peace plan adrift as envoy quits The man tasked with working on the \u201cultimate deal\u201d for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, spearheaded by Jared Kushner, is to leave his post, the White House announced on Thursday.

Former Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe dead at 95 The former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, whose nearly four-decade rule began as a celebrated example of African liberation yet ended as a cautionary tale of tyranny and corruption, has died aged 95. Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence from Britain\u2019s white supremacist colonial rule in 1980, was finally ousted by a military takeover in November 2017.

In a statement early on Friday, Mnangagwa described Mugabe as \u201can icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people\u201d. Cheat sheet Hungary\u2019s president, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has endorsed the far-right\u2019s \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d, claiming \u201cthere are political forces in Europe who want a replacement of [its] population\u201d by non-Europeans, as he promoted his \u201cprocreation, not immigration\u201d policy at a demography summit in Budapest. The US defense secretary, Mark Esper, has warned the UK and other European countries that by refusing to repatriate hundreds of Islamic State fighters and put them on trial in their home countries, they are creating a risk to regional security. Boris Johnson\u2019s younger brother, Jo Johnson, has quit his role as a UK cabinet minister and MP over Brexit \u2013 which he has long opposed \u2013 citing an \u201cunresolvable tension\u201d between his family loyalty and the national interest. Nicki Minaj has announced her retirement from the music business to focus on family life, after blazing a trail for other female rappers such as Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Saweetie. It is unclear whether her retirement is permanent.

Mona Chalabi crunches the numbers to find the fairest approach to bathroom design.

Opening with some syrupy-soft emo vocals over gentle, bubbling synth lines before the 80s drum beat properly kicks in, Lifeline \u2013 which also features Caroline \u201cChairlift\u201d Polachek \u2013 is like a classic power ballad delivered to us from the far future.</p> <h2><strong>Post Malone </strong><br><strong>Circles</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXhTHyIgQ_U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wXhTHyIgQ_U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On the one hand, Post Malone looks like a secondary school mephedrone dealer who starts fires and smells like chip grease. On the other, he keeps releasing these curiously affecting, catchy earworms. His latest, Circles, is a bittersweet, surprisingly tender lament on a love gone cold, delivered over dreamy indie guitar. If you still don\u2019t know where to place this guy, don\u2019t bother: just daub a shopping list around your eyebrows and begrudgingly enjoy the song.</p> <h2><strong>Jack Pe\u00f1ate </strong><br><strong>Prayer</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un8fZVIKjgw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Un8fZVIKjgw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Between the layered, gospel-tinged vocals and minimal electronic claps, this almost sounds like what would happen if James Blake and Bon Iver started teaching music in schools. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s Jack Pe\u00f1ate, the indie musician who made your 2007 boyfriend think plaid shirts and ukuleles were a good substitute for a vibesless personality. And no amount of abstract dance moves and mood lighting will alter that fact.</p> <h2><strong>Tegan and Sara </strong><br><strong>I\u2019ll Be Back Someday</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRtBDpm6zY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7PRtBDpm6zY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>With a reboot of The L Word on the horizon, it\u2019s very timely of Tegan and Sara \u2013 who have spent the past two decades slowly amassing a diehard queer mega-following \u2013 to release a pop-punk song that sounds as if it should soundtrack Shane tonguing someone in a skinny leather tie and vest. In other words, I\u2019ll Be Back Someday fits neatly within their tried-and-tested formula: riffs, feelings, then more riffs and more feelings.</p> <h2><strong>Bombay Bicycle Club </strong><br><strong>Eat, Sleep, Wake (Nothing But You)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFb86yrodxE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zFb86yrodxE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I must admit I haven\u2019t listened to Bombay Bicycle Club since I was 15 and thought three neon belts wrapped round white jeans was a good look. But they\u2019re back after a five-year hiatus and people seem to be excited, so they must be doing something right. Their comeback single is a wistful indie jam about romance and daydreaming. Is it nice? Yes. Will it change your life? Absolutely not.</p>",

Opening with some syrupy-soft emo vocals over gentle, bubbling synth lines before the 80s drum beat properly kicks in, Lifeline \u2013 which also features Caroline \u201cChairlift\u201d Polachek \u2013 is like a classic power ballad delivered to us from the far future. Post Malone Circles On the one hand, Post Malone looks like a secondary school mephedrone dealer who starts fires and smells like chip grease. On the other, he keeps releasing these curiously affecting, catchy earworms. His latest, Circles, is a bittersweet, surprisingly tender lament on a love gone cold, delivered over dreamy indie guitar. If you still don\u2019t know where to place this guy, don\u2019t bother: just daub a shopping list around your eyebrows and begrudgingly enjoy the song. Jack Pe\u00f1ate Prayer Between the layered, gospel-tinged vocals and minimal electronic claps, this almost sounds like what would happen if James Blake and Bon Iver started teaching music in schools. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s Jack Pe\u00f1ate, the indie musician who made your 2007 boyfriend think plaid shirts and ukuleles were a good substitute for a vibesless personality. And no amount of abstract dance moves and mood lighting will alter that fact. Tegan and Sara I\u2019ll Be Back Someday With a reboot of The L Word on the horizon, it\u2019s very timely of Tegan and Sara \u2013 who have spent the past two decades slowly amassing a diehard queer mega-following \u2013 to release a pop-punk song that sounds as if it should soundtrack Shane tonguing someone in a skinny leather tie and vest. In other words, I\u2019ll Be Back Someday fits neatly within their tried-and-tested formula: riffs, feelings, then more riffs and more feelings. Bombay Bicycle Club Eat, Sleep, Wake (Nothing But You) I must admit I haven\u2019t listened to Bombay Bicycle Club since I was 15 and thought three neon belts wrapped round white jeans was a good look. But they\u2019re back after a five-year hiatus and people seem to be excited, so they must be doing something right. Their comeback single is a wistful indie jam about romance and daydreaming. Is it nice? Yes. Will it change your life? Absolutely not.",

She said: \u201cIf we won the general election we would need to put a viable way of leaving the EU that had been negotiated with jobs and the economy at the forefront of our minds versus remain. Whatever deal was finally agreed by whatever government, we would demand a referendum.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cOn the basis of what Jeremy [Corbyn] has said we would need to put a viable leave option against remain. There would be a referendum and it would be for the good sense of the British people to decide which way we went forward. This is proper democracy. We have been struggling with this for three years but in the end we are deferential to the will of the people and it has been a long time since the last referendum.\u201d</p>",

She suggested Labour would back an election in November after an extension to Brexit had been agreed. She said: \u201cWe are not talking about very long, are we, but we need to get this immediate crisis dealt with first.\u201d She also appeared to rule out Labour calling for a no-confidence motion in the government next week. \u201cLooking at the rules it would be difficult for us to have a successful motion of no confidence,\u201d she said. Thornberry insisted Labour was \u201cunited\u201d with opposition parties on the need to rule out a no-deal Brexit before backing an election. She said: \u201cThe possibility of having a general election obviously is extremely attractive, but we have an immediate crisis in front of us and that has to be sorted before we do anything else. \u201cUnfortunately, given the behaviour of the prime minister and his advisers, we need to be absolutely sure that we are not going to end up in a situation where the general election is used as a distraction while they, by some cunning wheeze, bounce us out of the European Union without a deal.\u201d Her comments echo remarks she made on BBC\u2019s Question Time on Thursday night, when she said: \u201cWe want a general election. Of course we do, [but] at the moment the emergency is we have a dishonest prime minister who will use every means possible to get us out of the European Union without a deal.\u201d Thornberry also confirmed Labour was set to a back a second referendum in its manifesto. She said: \u201cIf we won the general election we would need to put a viable way of leaving the EU that had been negotiated with jobs and the economy at the forefront of our minds versus remain. Whatever deal was finally agreed by whatever government, we would demand a referendum.\u201d She added: \u201cOn the basis of what Jeremy [Corbyn] has said we would need to put a viable leave option against remain. There would be a referendum and it would be for the good sense of the British people to decide which way we went forward. This is proper democracy. We have been struggling with this for three years but in the end we are deferential to the will of the people and it has been a long time since the last referendum.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In April this year, I was diving for fossils in Peace river in Florida, not far from where I teach marine science at a private naval academy. At 24, I\u2019d been diving in the area for six years without any problems, and was guiding the dive for two friends, including Jake Koehler, who films videos of his underwater finds for his YouTube channel, <a href=\"https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/04/17/creators-going-pro-dallmyd/\" title=\"\">Dallmyd</a>. Because of the danger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/09/miami-woman-bitten-and-likely-killed-by-alligator-officials-confirm\" title=\"\">from alligators</a>, we\u2019d usually drop anchor on a particular spot, and bang on the boat and throw rocks to disturb them, as they tend to avoid contact with humans. But we hadn\u2019t got much on film that day, so we decided to take a chance and do something unusual: instead of staying in one area, we jumped in the river and drifted backwards with the current.</p> <p>I drifted into a very narrow channel, about a quarter of a mile ahead of the others, wearing my usual scuba gear: a gas tank, a lifejacket and weight belt. I suddenly felt an intense pressure on my left ankle, and, for a split second, I thought it was Jake messing about. We\u2019d been joking earlier that my black wetsuit made me look like bait \u2013 the other two were wearing camouflage wetsuits. But then the pressure became unbelievably intense, and I realised it was a gator.</p> <p>He was already twisting me like a corkscrew as he dragged me to the bottom, in what I knew as a marine biologist was a death roll \u2013 almost always lethal. My survival instinct kicked in: I\u2019ve never known such mental clarity. The water was only 8ft deep, so I inflated my lifejacket, and kicked with my free leg towards the surface, dragging the gator with me. I could feel him pulling my leg down, and it felt as if I was being ripped in half. As we broke the water, I saw he was around 8-9ft long, his tail lashing in a frenzy as he tried to roll with me again. I knew that if he took me back down, he would twist my foot off.</p> <p>Unlike victims of a shark attack, most people attacked by gators drown rather than bleed to death; my scuba gear had bought me valuable time. But my biggest fear now was that my regulator, which delivered air, would be ripped out of my mouth, or that I\u2019d become trapped beneath a rock or the roots of a tree.</p> <p>I hammered the gator\u2019s head with my free foot as hard as I could, but his jaws were clamped around my ankle with a force equivalent to that of a T rex. I understood that I would only be able to free myself if the gator tried to get a better grip on me with a bite readjustment, so I kept hammering, forcing him to reposition. The pressure on my ankle eased for just a second, and I took my chance. When his jaws clamped down again, this time he got a mouthful of my flipper. Kicking with all my strength, I got my foot out of the flipper and swam for my life to the riverbank.</p> <p>Gators don\u2019t like prey that makes their life difficult, so he didn\u2019t pursue me. I sat panting on the bank in shock, waiting for my friends to surface. His teeth had ripped through two layers of my wetsuit, cutting deep into my flesh, but it was the crush injury that caused the most damage. My ankle was twice its normal size.</p> <p>When my buddies surfaced five minutes later, they had no idea what had happened. Between them, they helped me back to the car, which was parked an hour away, and took me to hospital. Astonishingly, nothing was broken. The doctors said I\u2019d make a full recovery. Medics came from all over the hospital to take a look at me: gator attacks are surprisingly rare, with fewer than 400 recorded in Florida over the past 70 years; few people survive a death roll.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/16/i-survived-15-days-adrift-raft-experience\">Experience: I survived 15 days adrift on a raft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jake posted the aftermath of the attack on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRwaR5lufLQ&amp;t=782s\" title=\"\">YouTube</a>, and, a week later, another diver contacted me, saying he\u2019d found my bright-yellow flipper. The bite marks were massive \u2013 it made me realise what a close call it had been.</p> <p>I don\u2019t blame the gator: I was on his turf, and I disturbed him. The attack hasn\u2019t put me off diving; I was back in the river again a few weeks later, posting my adventures on Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.terasocial.com/p/thinkseek\" title=\"\">@thinkseek</a> \u2013 though now I\u2019m careful to stick to an area I\u2019ve already scouted.

      "bodyText": "In April this year, I was diving for fossils in Peace river in Florida, not far from where I teach marine science at a private naval academy. At 24, I\u2019d been diving in the area for six years without any problems, and was guiding the dive for two friends, including Jake Koehler, who films videos of his underwater finds for his YouTube channel, Dallmyd. Because of the danger from alligators, we\u2019d usually drop anchor on a particular spot, and bang on the boat and throw rocks to disturb them, as they tend to avoid contact with humans. But we hadn\u2019t got much on film that day, so we decided to take a chance and do something unusual: instead of staying in one area, we jumped in the river and drifted backwards with the current. I drifted into a very narrow channel, about a quarter of a mile ahead of the others, wearing my usual scuba gear: a gas tank, a lifejacket and weight belt. I suddenly felt an intense pressure on my left ankle, and, for a split second, I thought it was Jake messing about. We\u2019d been joking earlier that my black wetsuit made me look like bait \u2013 the other two were wearing camouflage wetsuits. But then the pressure became unbelievably intense, and I realised it was a gator. He was already twisting me like a corkscrew as he dragged me to the bottom, in what I knew as a marine biologist was a death roll \u2013 almost always lethal. My survival instinct kicked in: I\u2019ve never known such mental clarity. The water was only 8ft deep, so I inflated my lifejacket, and kicked with my free leg towards the surface, dragging the gator with me. I could feel him pulling my leg down, and it felt as if I was being ripped in half. As we broke the water, I saw he was around 8-9ft long, his tail lashing in a frenzy as he tried to roll with me again. I knew that if he took me back down, he would twist my foot off. Unlike victims of a shark attack, most people attacked by gators drown rather than bleed to death; my scuba gear had bought me valuable time. But my biggest fear now was that my regulator, which delivered air, would be ripped out of my mouth, or that I\u2019d become trapped beneath a rock or the roots of a tree. I hammered the gator\u2019s head with my free foot as hard as I could, but his jaws were clamped around my ankle with a force equivalent to that of a T rex. I understood that I would only be able to free myself if the gator tried to get a better grip on me with a bite readjustment, so I kept hammering, forcing him to reposition. The pressure on my ankle eased for just a second, and I took my chance. When his jaws clamped down again, this time he got a mouthful of my flipper. Kicking with all my strength, I got my foot out of the flipper and swam for my life to the riverbank. Gators don\u2019t like prey that makes their life difficult, so he didn\u2019t pursue me. I sat panting on the bank in shock, waiting for my friends to surface. His teeth had ripped through two layers of my wetsuit, cutting deep into my flesh, but it was the crush injury that caused the most damage. My ankle was twice its normal size. When my buddies surfaced five minutes later, they had no idea what had happened. Between them, they helped me back to the car, which was parked an hour away, and took me to hospital. Astonishingly, nothing was broken. The doctors said I\u2019d make a full recovery. Medics came from all over the hospital to take a look at me: gator attacks are surprisingly rare, with fewer than 400 recorded in Florida over the past 70 years; few people survive a death roll. Jake posted the aftermath of the attack on YouTube, and, a week later, another diver contacted me, saying he\u2019d found my bright-yellow flipper. The bite marks were massive \u2013 it made me realise what a close call it had been. I don\u2019t blame the gator: I was on his turf, and I disturbed him. The attack hasn\u2019t put me off diving; I was back in the river again a few weeks later, posting my adventures on Instagram at @thinkseek \u2013 though now I\u2019m careful to stick to an area I\u2019ve already scouted. It\u2019s important to me that young people in particular recognise that we humans are just one part of an extraordinary natural world, and that we can out-think these magnificent predators without destroying them. \u2022 As told to Tess Stimson \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2019. An earlier version referred to \u201coxygen\u201d in a breathing tank rather than air. Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com",

There are two different forces that can cause concussions: linear and angular. Linear involves a direct, head-to-head blow.

The intention was to curb the passage of low-skilled migrants into Switzerland, including free movement with the EU. However, the consequences have been far-reaching \u2013 and one unintended effect has been more than five years of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26225121\" title=\"\">isolation and regression</a> for the country\u2019s academic institutions and research groups.</p> <p>Swiss researchers were immediately locked out of Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation programme, as well as the prestigious European Research Council, and saw their status as key players in Europe evaporate. Unbeknownst to the government, the referendum result undermined seven bilateral arrangements with the EU, dating back as far as 2002.</p> <p>A stand-off ensued as the Swiss thrashed around to find a compromise. But the effects were brutal. Swiss research institutions were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/whatever-you-do-dont-become-switzerland-swiss-academics-tell-uk\" title=\"\">marginalised</a>, and their outreach efforts operated in a climate of uncertainty. According to Andreas Mortensen, the vice-president for research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, \u201cThe whole thing [the 2014 referendum] created a lack of assurance \u2013 we saw a large decrease in the number of European projects led by our researchers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07b0f4481939b1826d821ea74d18eaf4c351b485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07b0f4481939b1826d821ea74d18eaf4c351b485/0_140_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man looking through microscope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If the proud research and innovation record of UK science is disrupted, then it will jeopardise all of our prosperity.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SeventyFour Images/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The long-term financial hit Swiss science has taken is still unclear. But the reputational damage has been significant. According to the Swiss research institute EPFL, levels of collaboration with the EU <a href=\"https://redknightconsultancy.co.uk/2019/02/07/a-flexible-horizon-europe-amid-uk-and-switzerland-fear-for-exclusion/\" title=\"\">dropped by a factor of 10</a>. Previously, Switzerland had ranked seventh for EU project coordinations, but after 2014 it plummeted to 24th place.</p> <p>For UK science, which boasts an incredible history of world-leading research and discovery, there\u2019s now a nervous wait. The fear is that a similar situation could manifest itself as Britain plots its exit from the EU. The country is, after all, one of the biggest recipients of research funding in the EU \u2013 claiming <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/uk-research-and-european-union/role-of-EU-in-funding-UK-research/how-much-funding-does-uk-get-in-comparison-with-other-countries/\" title=\"\">\u20ac8.8bn (\u00a37.9bn) out of a total of \u20ac107bn</a> during the funding round of 2007-2013. To abandon this would be catastrophic \u2013 and could put the UK on a Swiss-style path to scientific exile.</p> <p>There is some recognition of the peril at hand, at least. The UK government has confirmed that, like its Swiss counterpart, it is prepared to step in to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\" title=\"\">make up the shortfall</a> in EU research funding. However, no money can compensate for the loss of invaluable collaborative networks. After 2014, Swiss researchers were not welcome at European research consortia, and the flow of EU-funded scientists into Switzerland stopped.</p> <p>The UK government has said that it wishes to retain access to major pan-European research programmes. Yet the reality of doing so, while simultaneously restricting freedom of movement, does not align with current EU rules \u2013 and is something that would make even associate membership of EU research programmes difficult, and perhaps impossible, to attain. The financial hit alone of a no-deal Brexit would cost UK research <a href=\"http://www.scientistsforeu.uk/no_deal_brexit_horizon_2020\" title=\"\">more than \u20ac577m per year</a> in lost opportunity to access very high-value grants \u2013 and that\u2019s before the cost is counted of the thousands of jobs that are tied to these projects, and the trickle-down effects their loss would have on the wider economy.</p> <p>So it\u2019s clear that some perspective is needed as we approach the Brexit deadline. The warnings of hundreds of experts, and the cautionary tale of Switzerland must not be ignored. If the proud research and innovation record of UK science is disrupted, it will jeopardise all of our prosperity.</p> <p>\u2022 Marja Makarow is a member of the strategic board of the University of Geneva and chair of Technology Academy Finland</p>",

However, the consequences have been far-reaching \u2013 and one unintended effect has been more than five years of isolation and regression for the country\u2019s academic institutions and research groups. Swiss researchers were immediately locked out of Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation programme, as well as the prestigious European Research Council, and saw their status as key players in Europe evaporate. Unbeknownst to the government, the referendum result undermined seven bilateral arrangements with the EU, dating back as far as 2002. A stand-off ensued as the Swiss thrashed around to find a compromise. But the effects were brutal. Swiss research institutions were marginalised, and their outreach efforts operated in a climate of uncertainty. According to Andreas Mortensen, the vice-president for research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, \u201cThe whole thing [the 2014 referendum] created a lack of assurance \u2013 we saw a large decrease in the number of European projects led by our researchers.\u201d The long-term financial hit Swiss science has taken is still unclear. But the reputational damage has been significant. According to the Swiss research institute EPFL, levels of collaboration with the EU dropped by a factor of 10. Previously, Switzerland had ranked seventh for EU project coordinations, but after 2014 it plummeted to 24th place. For UK science, which boasts an incredible history of world-leading research and discovery, there\u2019s now a nervous wait. The fear is that a similar situation could manifest itself as Britain plots its exit from the EU. The country is, after all, one of the biggest recipients of research funding in the EU \u2013 claiming \u20ac8.8bn (\u00a37.9bn) out of a total of \u20ac107bn during the funding round of 2007-2013. To abandon this would be catastrophic \u2013 and could put the UK on a Swiss-style path to scientific exile. There is some recognition of the peril at hand, at least. The UK government has confirmed that, like its Swiss counterpart, it is prepared to step in to make up the shortfall in EU research funding. However, no money can compensate for the loss of invaluable collaborative networks. After 2014, Swiss researchers were not welcome at European research consortia, and the flow of EU-funded scientists into Switzerland stopped. The UK government has said that it wishes to retain access to major pan-European research programmes. Yet the reality of doing so, while simultaneously restricting freedom of movement, does not align with current EU rules \u2013 and is something that would make even associate membership of EU research programmes difficult, and perhaps impossible, to attain. The financial hit alone of a no-deal Brexit would cost UK research more than \u20ac577m per year in lost opportunity to access very high-value grants \u2013 and that\u2019s before the cost is counted of the thousands of jobs that are tied to these projects, and the trickle-down effects their loss would have on the wider economy. So it\u2019s clear that some perspective is needed as we approach the Brexit deadline. The warnings of hundreds of experts, and the cautionary tale of Switzerland must not be ignored. If the proud research and innovation record of UK science is disrupted, it will jeopardise all of our prosperity. \u2022 Marja Makarow is a member of the strategic board of the University of Geneva and chair of Technology Academy Finland",

      "body": "<p>As the armoured vehicles rolled in to Harare in November 2017, after weeks of political fencing and brinksmanship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/robert-mugabe\" title=\"\">Robert Mugabe</a> could not believe he had lost. The senior military leadership who placed the Zimbabwean president under house arrest made it clear they were conducting the politest of coups, while stressing to the outside world that it was not a coup at all. It was merely a corrective action and, indeed, at its end, with Mugabe\u2019s resignation, it was still his party, Zanu-PF, in power.</p> \n<p>Mugabe, who has died aged 95, came to power as a result of the gun \u2013 wielded by others, as he himself never fought in the field \u2013 and fell by those who wielded the gun. And, as he fell, the true depths of the economic mire into which he had plunged Zimbabwe \u2013 spending so much time on party and succession battles, and seemingly none on issues of deep impoverishment and national non-productivity \u2013 became apparent. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmerson-mnangagwa\" title=\"\">Emmerson Mnangagwa</a>, the new president, in stressing an economic emphasis and outreach to the world, seemed to admit that the country was bankrupt and that Mugabe had made it so. </p> \n<p>Mugabe\u2019s fall from power lifted the political paralysis that had gripped Zimbabwe, which he led as prime minister from 1980, and president from 1987. His authoritarian nature, his ruthless manoeuvres, his stature as the leader of liberation and his scathing disdain of rivals could be a dead hand on friend and foe alike. However, Mugabe was a highly complex man. He saw himself as last in a line of African liberators and was determined to carry that legacy with him till his death, but he remained an enigma to the non-African world. Even in the 1980s, when he was the darling of the west, diplomats in Harare would characterise him as secluded, deeply private, and monastic in his self-discipline. Though he was also often elegant and eloquent, these characteristics did not disguise his capacity for ruthlessness.</p> \n<p>Nor did his immense self-regard as an intellectual. The collector of several master\u2019s degrees, he looked down on his principal democratic challenger, the less well educated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/14/morgan-tsvangirai-obituary\" title=\"\">Morgan Tsvangirai</a>, and on all those not schooled in the texts of pan-Africanism and African liberation. His problematic affinity with the South African president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mbeki\" title=\"\">Thabo Mbeki</a> after the 2008 elections stemmed from Mbeki\u2019s own liberation credentials, but also from Mbeki\u2019s essays on the black struggle as defining both a new Africa and a postcolonial era. Those essays, however, and the Pan-Africanism they espoused, were centred on a doctrine of inclusivity. As a result, Mbeki discouraged Mugabe\u2019s efforts to marginalise completely an opposition leader who had demonstrated significant popular support.</p> \n<p>For all his stature and his hugely controversial legacy, Mugabe\u2019s start in nationalist politics was courageous and principled, but not auspicious. He was never a fighter, carrying a rifle in the campaigns against white rule. And nor, despite his commitment to nationalisation of the land, was he ever a peasant, a farmer, or someone who had gripped a hoe until calluses formed.</p> \n<p>It was in prison that he began his rise in the nationalist ranks. His militant opposition to white minority rule in what was then Rhodesia led to a 10-year jail term in 1964, after the banning of the newly formed Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu). Mugabe refused to break under pressure \u2013 whereas the Zanu founder and leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/15/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Ndabaningi Sithole</a>, did, renouncing subversion and terrorism after he was sentenced in 1969 for incitement.</p> \n<p>By 1974 Mugabe had taken over as leader of the imprisoned movement, but this did not mean he was recognised as a leader outside. Much of his time in prison was spent reading for external degrees from universities in London and South Africa. He was helped by academics at the London School of Economics and the School of Oriental and African Studies. As with the African National Congress (ANC) detainees on Robben Island, a university of the cells was established by the detainees and Mugabe, who had been a teacher in Ghana in the early 1960s, was one of the lecturers.</p> \n<p>By the time of his release, he had well-developed views and was vehemently opposed to any accommodation or compromise agreement between the frontline states of southern Africa \u2013 committed to ending apartheid and white minority rule \u2013 and Rhodesia. Zambia\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kenneth-Kaunda\" title=\"\">Kenneth Kaunda</a>, considered Mugabe such a risk to his ambitions for a peaceful region that he had him arrested in 1974. The man who had tasted white imprisonment now found himself detained by a black president. It is perhaps no coincidence then that after Zimbabwe\u2019s independence was achieved and the presidents of the frontline states were honoured with Harare streets named after them, Kaunda\u2019s street was a polluted road beside the railway station.</p> \n<p>Kaunda had considered Mugabe an unreasonable and disruptive force and was glad to be rid of him. Arresting him had been an embarrassment, and his \u201cescape\u201d was probably engineered by the Zambians themselves. Mugabe resumed his nationalist activities in Mozambique.</p> \n<p>Once across the border, Mugabe found that his prison credentials were not enough to persuade the Zimbabwean nationalist forces \u2013 who had massed in Mozambique and had begun a military onslaught against Rhodesia \u2013 to accept him as leader.</p> \n<p>In Mozambique, President <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samora-Machel\" title=\"\">Samora Machel</a> arrested him, ostensibly for Mugabe\u2019s own safety in the face of antipathy from the guerrilla leaders already there, but Machel also shared Kaunda\u2019s suspicion of Mugabe. However, by a series of adroit manoeuvres which established his early reputation for ruthlessness, Mugabe sidelined the rebels\u2019 military command with the support of one key commander, Solomon Mujuru (at the time known by his nom de guerre, Rex Nhongo), and in 1977 he was elected president of Zanu.</p> \n<p>Mugabe politicised Zanu to an unprecedented degree. He subordinated the military leaders to party rule and infused the sense of nationalist struggle with his pan-Africanist ideals. The combination of the gun and Mugabe\u2019s political ascent sparked the imagination of young people in Rhodesia, and they flocked to fight under his banner. Trained with Chinese assistance in Mozambique and Tanzania, they were sent back to fight the white regime.</p> \n<p>It is part of the mythology created by Mugabe that his guerrillas won independence and majority rule for Zimbabwe, forcing the white Rhodesian forces to capitulate. There is little doubt that his forces inflicted much more damage on the white establishment and infrastructure than the rival forces of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jul/02/guardianobituaries.andrewmeldrum\" title=\"\">Joshua Nkomo</a>\u2019s Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union, operating from Zambian bases. The two rival armies were made up of differing ethnicities from opposite ends of the country. Though never on friendly terms, the two men had entered a negotiating alliance to secure independence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ed344cddb5eca85b2cd2f8f74836ae922388010\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ed344cddb5eca85b2cd2f8f74836ae922388010/0_205_2892_1736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joshua Nkomo, left, and Robert Mugabe leaving peace talks in Geneva in 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua Nkomo, left, and Robert Mugabe leaving peace talks in Geneva in 1976.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dieter Endlicher/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mugabe\u2019s fighters had forced a bloody stalemate on the battlefield, one that \u2013 just by pure paring down of numbers \u2013 the minority white population could not have sustained for ever. But the white army was not defeated. It took the advent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a> as British prime minister in 1979, her foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/10/peter-carrington-lord-carrington-obituary\" title=\"\">Lord Carrington</a>, and the diplomacy of Kaunda and the Commonwealth secretary general, Shridath Ramphal \u2013 not to mention the co-operation of apartheid South Africa \u2013 to force negotiations at the end of 1979 that led to the transformation of Rhodesia into Zimbabwe.</p> \n<p>The white minority Rhodesian government, alarmed by the attrition of the war, contrived a coalition with moderate black nationalists. Thatcher, anxious to be rid of a diplomatic burden, was prepared to recognise the coalition, but despatched Carrington on a last effort to find a compromise to accommodate all parties. Kaunda and Ramphal persuaded Mugabe and Nkomo to come to the negotiating table, and South Africa, anxious not to have a militant black government on its borders \u2013 one which had taken the country by force \u2013 persuaded the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, to attend.</p> \n<p>The truce that resulted was followed by elections at the end of February 1980. Mugabe won a landslide victory. The newly enfranchised black majority recognised those who had fought for them. It was not the result Thatcher and Carrington had anticipated, but Mugabe\u2019s national address of reconciliation between black and white mollified almost everyone. Mugabe began his rule in Zimbabwe as an internationally acclaimed freedom fighter and apostle of reconciliation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0d06ebc5096a5d70737bfdf0d18631bc4525a9a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0d06ebc5096a5d70737bfdf0d18631bc4525a9a/0_194_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher and Robert Mugabe in 1988.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher and Robert Mugabe in 1988.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Almost overnight, he became the new beacon of Africa. He remained in power for 37 years, fighting and winning every election during this time. His concern for electoral validation, even as he entered his last authoritarian phase, was in some senses the mark of a man who, despite all his intellect and ruthlessness, never quite got over the bodies sacrificed during his ascent.</p> \n<p>Those bodies accumulated as he held power. The west seemed unaware of the slaughters he instigated in Nkomo\u2019s powerbase, the two Matabeleland provinces of western Zimbabwe, from 1982 to 1987. On the suspicion that a rebellion was forming among disaffected former members of Nkomo\u2019s guerrilla army, Mugabe sent in North Korean-trained units to crush them. Exact figures are difficult to ascertain, but some tens of thousands of civilians were killed in a \u201cpolice action\u201d that turned into a bloody and gratuitous pogrom.</p> \n<p>Away from the Matabelelands, Mugabe\u2019s first years in power were regarded internationally as peaceful and democratic. He easily won the 1985 elections but in 1990 faced opposition from his former liberation colleague <a href=\"https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2011/06/obituary-edgar-tekere-1937-2011/\" title=\"\">Edgar Tekere</a>. Mugabe engaged in a series of intimidatory tactics that flawed an election that he would have won anyway. It set a tone of \u201cdemocracy if there is no serious opposition\u201d. There seemed no irony when, in 1991, the Commonwealth released the Harare Declaration on Human Rights (covering all member states), nor in 1992, when Mugabe lectured the Chinese on the desirability and harmlessness of opposition parties.</p> \n<p>But it was also in 1992 that the land question returned to haunt Mugabe. Carrington had pointedly refused to have land ownership included in the negotiations that led to independence in 1980, despite Mugabe\u2019s insistence that most of the landowning settlers were historically of British origin. Also, early efforts at negotiation in the mid-70s had included compensation for land nationalisation, paid from western sources. However, 1992 saw drought sweep Zimbabwe and questions of productivity of the land were swiftly caught up in those to do with ownership of it. Although the Land Acquisition Act of that year was never enforced, it should have been a warning sign to all, including the international community, that a gradual, phased and compensated programme of land nationalisation should be placed on the agenda before it was forced on to it.</p> \n<p>Instead, when Mugabe approached the newly elected Tony Blair about the issue in 1997, he received such a curt dismissal that an antipathy towards Blair became a burning element of Mugabe\u2019s feelings towards Britain. Some, like the Commonwealth secretary general of that period, Emeka Anyaoku, maintain that the land issue had been postponed in 1992 so as not to alarm white negotiators in South Africa, as that country made its final steps towards majority rule. After Carrington, the British had hoped to nudge the question of land ownership off the main agenda by small but regular funds for land nationalisation. John Major had ensured that this was the case in the early 1990s, but Blair adamantly refused any assurance of increase or even continuation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca47a23d9ff1610beab33df54bae210918aefb04\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca47a23d9ff1610beab33df54bae210918aefb04/0_143_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair and Robert Mugabe in 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair and Robert Mugabe in 1997.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This was a lack of historical comprehension on Blair\u2019s part. Although Mugabe\u2019s latter-day views of historical need highlighted the land question, the struggle for independence was as much about racism, equality and freedom. Carrington thought he could sideline land while delivering an acceptable breakthrough on the other goals of the struggle. The British government argued that it could not afford large-scale compensation at that point, and Carrington had been given a hard time by the white delegation at the 1979 negotiations. But the land issue could not be kept off the agenda for ever. Two-thirds of the arable land of Zimbabwe was in white ownership, acquired by seizure and legislation in which black voices played no part. The argument of the white farmers would have rested on what they had done to make the land commercially productive \u2013 so the debate, had Britain been wise, should have been over compensation, but not over historical rights. However, it was the rights issue that, after 1997, Mugabe wheeled out with great literal force.</p> \n<p>Mugabe had always been committed intellectually to a vision of black culture having its historical moment. The achievement of the black personality in terms of both its heritage and its place in the modern world was of extreme importance to him. However, given a choice between the fulfilment of that heritage \u2013 and to Mugabe that increasingly came to mean ownership of the land \u2013 and place within modernity, then he was prepared to choose heritage.</p> \n<p>In many ways 1997 was the year that marked the beginning of the downturn of Zimbabwe. Although Mugabe had won the 1995 elections easily, the advent of the war veterans as a pressure group made itself felt soon afterwards. The economy was slowly but markedly deteriorating. Civil society began to campaign with increasing effect for a new constitution, and Mugabe began to express his immense distaste for the British legacy in Zimbabwe, based on both the land issue and what rapidly became a visceral animosity towards Blair.</p> \n<p>Had Mugabe retired in 1995, he would have been hailed internationally as a great leader. The slaughters in the Matabelelands would have been considered an unfortunate aberration. Now, as the century turned, Mugabe was well into his 70s. He finally seized the land, but bankrupted the country he had fought so hard to win, divided his own citizens, oppressed those who refused to support him, and created in the midst of a new national poverty a class of oligarchs who stole money from his \u201chistorical moment\u201d and supported him as much for their own gain as their deep belief in him and his vision. Land was gained, but equality and freedom lost.</p> \n<p>If the decline of Zimbabwe began in 1997, recovery with good management was still possible. Mugabe, however, was sucked into the war then raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This caused great expense, but it also helped him to consolidate the support of his generals as they were given free rein to plunder the mineral resources of the DRC. However, the public expense and other economic issues, coupled with Mugabe\u2019s increasingly authoritarian demeanour, prompted the creation of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), led by Tsvangirai, in 1999. It became immediately apparent that the new opposition party had a national following.</p> \n<p>Against all Mugabe\u2019s expectations, it defeated him in a referendum in early 2000 which he had called over constitutional issues, including an amendment to give the presidency even more power. It was his first defeat, and although it had not been at an election, Mugabe came to recognise the opposition\u2019s strength and was determined that, in elections to come, he would triumph over Tsvangirai and the MDC.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the referendum, the pro-Mugabe war veterans were unleashed to begin the seizure of white-owned farms, and administrative and financial chaos descended. For what Mugabe never factored in to his pastoral vision of African heritage was that the agricultural economy of his country was based, not on a romanticised sense of peasant ownership and what it could produce, but on an aggressive and highly modern agriculture industry that sold food and tobacco on the international markets.</p> \n<p>Mugabe and Zanu-PF won the 2000 parliamentary elections, then the 2002 presidential ones. He followed this with victory at the 2005 parliamentary polls. But he resorted increasingly to violence and vote-rigging. The violence could be naked, but the rigging was of a highly sophisticated nature and no one has yet uncovered all the details of how it was done. Away from polls, everything the MDC could throw at Mugabe \u2013 strikes and protests \u2013 was met by repression, heavy-handed police action and violence from hired thugs and paramilitaries. Tsvangirai was charged with treason and, though acquitted, a campaign of psychological harassment was unleashed on him. He began to make mistakes and the MDC split.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93f5aa047a2936603cda055fee171d7b077f6a6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f5aa047a2936603cda055fee171d7b077f6a6d/10_0_3480_2089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Mugabe as president and Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister after signing Zimbabwe\u2019s new constitution into law in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Mugabe as president and Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister after signing Zimbabwe\u2019s new constitution into law in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A dispirited Tsvangirai then faced the combined presidential and parliamentary elections of 2008 with a split among MDC supporters. All popular wisdom and political punditry suggested that he would be crushed. Mugabe was supremely confident. But the ruination of the country had been such that the electorate insisted on change. By some estimates, Tsvangirai and the MDC won 56% of the vote. But when the pattern of results became apparent, Mugabe and his party panicked. Counting promptly stopped.</p> \n<p>There followed many weeks of painstaking recounts of the opposition\u2019s vote until it fell below 50%. A runoff was then declared for the presidency which prompted Mugabe to resort to further violence and intimidation. Tsvangirai withdrew in protest and Mugabe was declared the victor.</p> \n<p>He had stolen it, but the nature of the theft was such that, at last, other African countries would not stomach a pretence of such magnitude. South Africa\u2019s Mbeki intensified his mediation efforts to bring Mugabe and Tsvangirai together. It was a protracted twisting of arms that eventually led to a fractious power-sharing coalition. Mugabe remained president, his generals and hard men remained powerful and rich, while Tsvangirai was made prime minister and given the task of lifting Zimbabwe out of the economic mire that Mugabe had caused. Mugabe\u2019s party made life difficult for Tsvangirai at every step.</p> \n<p>Even so, Tsvangirai\u2019s efforts at government, including the appointment of Tendai Biti as finance minister, and Biti\u2019s wise ministrations of the economy, did bring stability to Zimbabwean financial transactions. And they allowed the consolidation of a Zimbabwean middle class that had been threatened by rampant hyper-inflation. But, despite a huge raft of appeals to surrounding presidents, Tsvangirai could not demilitarise Mugabe\u2019s hold on the election machinery, and the shadow of military power on society as a whole. The electorate, anxious to hold on to its new financial stability, were drawn once again to Mugabe\u2019s party in the 2013 elections, fearing chaos and military struggle if it was defeated.</p> \n<p>Tsvangirai, although impressive as an opposition leader, never really inspired as a prime minister. Although the 2013 elections were rigged to an extent, it was also clear that large numbers voted for Mugabe willingly, and that Tsvangirai had not done enough to break his iron grip on the institutions of Zimbabwe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/14/morgan-tsvangirai-obituary\" title=\"\">He died in 2018</a>.</p> \n<p>The presidency from 2013 onwards became an economic disaster. Mugabe began to concentrate increasingly on party matters, rather than national government. Obsessed with the possibility of plots against him, he purged the party of even his most prized lieutenants. Joice Mujuru, his vice-president, a war heroine and the widow of Solomon Mujuru \u2013 who died in mysterious circumstances in 2011 \u2013 was purged in December 2014.</p> \n<p>The economy began to plummet as Mugabe\u2019s plans to extend nationalisation from land to industry abruptly halted foreign direct investment of any sizeable nature. The stabilisation of the economy during the coalition years under Tsvangirai and Biti had depended on the substitution of the Zimbabwean currency by US dollars. Now, without investment, and increasingly without productivity \u2013 aided and abetted by an increase in corruption by Mugabe\u2019s militarised oligarchy \u2013 the dollars dried up. The country went through increasing periods when there were simply no physical dollars in everyday circulation.</p> \n<p>In the midst of this meltdown, citizen protest began to increase. Demands for salaries to be paid on time began to be transformed into a critique of corruption and, increasingly, of an old man in his 90s with no new ideas and a constant need for medical rejuvenation in a variety of foreign clinics. In the face of widening unrest and the loss of support from his war-veteran allies, Mugabe vowed to stay in power, insisting he would stand again for the presidency in 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41bf7346eb149201afad218581e8ce6d1358426c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41bf7346eb149201afad218581e8ce6d1358426c/0_118_2190_1313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert and Grace Mugabe at a youth rally in Marondera, Zimbabwe, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert and Grace Mugabe at a youth rally in Marondera, Zimbabwe, 2017.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was not to be. Preoccupied with holding party factions in check both for the sake of a balance of power within Zanu-PF, and then increasingly to position <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/grace-mugabe\" title=\"\">his wife, Grace</a>, for the succession, Mugabe failed to give attention to the economy and indeed began sabotaging his finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, by reinstating public servants whom Chinamasa had wanted to dismiss as part of a programme to curtail public expenditure. There were no plans to increase productivity or search for new markets. A bottle of cooking oil became cheaper to import from South Africa than its Zimbabwean production cost. The shortage of US dollars, introduced in 2009, meant the printing of bond notes that heralded the beginnings of new hyperinflation. When the generals moved against Mugabe, it was a move against mismanagement, the prospect of more of the same from his wife, and Mugabe\u2019s willingness to sacrifice a noted war veteran, Mnangagwa, to placate Grace and smooth the path for her ambitions. It was an ignominious downfall for someone who had risen so high from nothing.</p> \n<p>Born and raised at Kutama Mission, in Zvimba district, west of Harare (then Salisbury), Mugabe was a bookish child. His father, Gabriel, deserted the family when Robert was 10, leaving his mother, Bona, to bring up the boy and his five siblings. He was educated by Jesuits, who imbued in him a deep faith, before in 1949 he won a scholarship to Fort Hare University in Eastern Cape, South Africa \u2013 a private institution that accepted black students \u2013 following closely behind Nelson Mandela. An entire generation of future African leaders passed through its doors and emerged with a taste for learning and for resistance.</p> \n<p>It was not until the 1970s and his time in Mozambique that Mugabe became a crypto-Marxist. His belief was anchored in a stages-of-history view of the world, with black liberation constituting a critical stage. It was a cultural and, to an extent, racist view of history \u2013 the latter perhaps inevitable as a reaction to the climate of minority white-ruled Rhodesia. Many shared this view and a good number of Zimbabwean intellectuals stood by him for years. His death is unlikely to diminish the sense of enigma that surrounded him, with passionate mourning expected in many parts of Africa and a sense of good riddance among many in the west.</p> \n<p>Mugabe\u2019s domestic life was marked by tragedy and controversy. He met Sally Hayfron while teaching in Ghana and they married in 1961. Their only son, Michael Nhamodzenyika (\u201csuffering country\u201d in Shona), died aged three while Mugabe was in jail. He was denied compassionate release for the funeral and it is said this embittered his view of the white population. Sally died in 1992. He then married his secretary Grace Marufu, who had borne him two children, Bona and Robert Jr, while he was still married to Sally. A third child, Chatunga, came once they were wedded. Grace was an extravagant figure, nicknamed both \u201cDis Grace\u201d and \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d \u2013 almost the perfect symbol of the oligarchic class around Mugabe \u2013 but she was loyal to her husband.</p> \n<p>However, when it became clear that Tsvangirai had won in 2008, but before the decision to rig the result was taken, she pleaded with Mugabe to stand down for the sake of their children, who were being taunted at school because their father \u201chad ruined the country\u201d.</p> \n<p>After the 2013 elections her demeanour became more and more preoccupied with maintaining her husband in power before she became involved in the struggle for the succession of an increasingly frail old man \u2013 seeking that succession for herself.</p> \n<p>With the death of Mugabe, questions of his enigma remain. He was, however, a nationalist leader with moments of greatness. He had a far more intellectual sense of African destiny than his critics would acknowledge. He would, in some ways, have made a better professor than a president but, as a president, he clung to power far too long. He achieved liberation and created a tragedy.</p> \n<p>He is survived by Grace, and their children, Bona, Robert and Chatunga.</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Robert Gabriel Mugabe, politician, born 21 February 1924; died 6 September 2019</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2019 because an earlier version referred to Matabeleland as being in eastern Zimbabwe.

      "bodyText": "As the armoured vehicles rolled in to Harare in November 2017, after weeks of political fencing and brinksmanship, Robert Mugabe could not believe he had lost. The senior military leadership who placed the Zimbabwean president under house arrest made it clear they were conducting the politest of coups, while stressing to the outside world that it was not a coup at all. It was merely a corrective action and, indeed, at its end, with Mugabe\u2019s resignation, it was still his party, Zanu-PF, in power. Mugabe, who has died aged 95, came to power as a result of the gun \u2013 wielded by others, as he himself never fought in the field \u2013 and fell by those who wielded the gun. And, as he fell, the true depths of the economic mire into which he had plunged Zimbabwe \u2013 spending so much time on party and succession battles, and seemingly none on issues of deep impoverishment and national non-productivity \u2013 became apparent. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the new president, in stressing an economic emphasis and outreach to the world, seemed to admit that the country was bankrupt and that Mugabe had made it so. Mugabe\u2019s fall from power lifted the political paralysis that had gripped Zimbabwe, which he led as prime minister from 1980, and president from 1987. His authoritarian nature, his ruthless manoeuvres, his stature as the leader of liberation and his scathing disdain of rivals could be a dead hand on friend and foe alike. However, Mugabe was a highly complex man. He saw himself as last in a line of African liberators and was determined to carry that legacy with him till his death, but he remained an enigma to the non-African world. Even in the 1980s, when he was the darling of the west, diplomats in Harare would characterise him as secluded, deeply private, and monastic in his self-discipline. Though he was also often elegant and eloquent, these characteristics did not disguise his capacity for ruthlessness. Nor did his immense self-regard as an intellectual. The collector of several master\u2019s degrees, he looked down on his principal democratic challenger, the less well educated Morgan Tsvangirai, and on all those not schooled in the texts of pan-Africanism and African liberation. His problematic affinity with the South African president Thabo Mbeki after the 2008 elections stemmed from Mbeki\u2019s own liberation credentials, but also from Mbeki\u2019s essays on the black struggle as defining both a new Africa and a postcolonial era. Those essays, however, and the Pan-Africanism they espoused, were centred on a doctrine of inclusivity. As a result, Mbeki discouraged Mugabe\u2019s efforts to marginalise completely an opposition leader who had demonstrated significant popular support. For all his stature and his hugely controversial legacy, Mugabe\u2019s start in nationalist politics was courageous and principled, but not auspicious. He was never a fighter, carrying a rifle in the campaigns against white rule. And nor, despite his commitment to nationalisation of the land, was he ever a peasant, a farmer, or someone who had gripped a hoe until calluses formed. It was in prison that he began his rise in the nationalist ranks. His militant opposition to white minority rule in what was then Rhodesia led to a 10-year jail term in 1964, after the banning of the newly formed Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu). Mugabe refused to break under pressure \u2013 whereas the Zanu founder and leader, Ndabaningi Sithole, did, renouncing subversion and terrorism after he was sentenced in 1969 for incitement. By 1974 Mugabe had taken over as leader of the imprisoned movement, but this did not mean he was recognised as a leader outside. Much of his time in prison was spent reading for external degrees from universities in London and South Africa. He was helped by academics at the London School of Economics and the School of Oriental and African Studies. As with the African National Congress (ANC) detainees on Robben Island, a university of the cells was established by the detainees and Mugabe, who had been a teacher in Ghana in the early 1960s, was one of the lecturers. By the time of his release, he had well-developed views and was vehemently opposed to any accommodation or compromise agreement between the frontline states of southern Africa \u2013 committed to ending apartheid and white minority rule \u2013 and Rhodesia. Zambia\u2019s president, Kenneth Kaunda, considered Mugabe such a risk to his ambitions for a peaceful region that he had him arrested in 1974. The man who had tasted white imprisonment now found himself detained by a black president. It is perhaps no coincidence then that after Zimbabwe\u2019s independence was achieved and the presidents of the frontline states were honoured with Harare streets named after them, Kaunda\u2019s street was a polluted road beside the railway station. Kaunda had considered Mugabe an unreasonable and disruptive force and was glad to be rid of him. Arresting him had been an embarrassment, and his \u201cescape\u201d was probably engineered by the Zambians themselves. Mugabe resumed his nationalist activities in Mozambique. Once across the border, Mugabe found that his prison credentials were not enough to persuade the Zimbabwean nationalist forces \u2013 who had massed in Mozambique and had begun a military onslaught against Rhodesia \u2013 to accept him as leader. In Mozambique, President Samora Machel arrested him, ostensibly for Mugabe\u2019s own safety in the face of antipathy from the guerrilla leaders already there, but Machel also shared Kaunda\u2019s suspicion of Mugabe. However, by a series of adroit manoeuvres which established his early reputation for ruthlessness, Mugabe sidelined the rebels\u2019 military command with the support of one key commander, Solomon Mujuru (at the time known by his nom de guerre, Rex Nhongo), and in 1977 he was elected president of Zanu. Mugabe politicised Zanu to an unprecedented degree. He subordinated the military leaders to party rule and infused the sense of nationalist struggle with his pan-Africanist ideals. The combination of the gun and Mugabe\u2019s political ascent sparked the imagination of young people in Rhodesia, and they flocked to fight under his banner. Trained with Chinese assistance in Mozambique and Tanzania, they were sent back to fight the white regime. It is part of the mythology created by Mugabe that his guerrillas won independence and majority rule for Zimbabwe, forcing the white Rhodesian forces to capitulate. There is little doubt that his forces inflicted much more damage on the white establishment and infrastructure than the rival forces of Joshua Nkomo\u2019s Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union, operating from Zambian bases. The two rival armies were made up of differing ethnicities from opposite ends of the country. Though never on friendly terms, the two men had entered a negotiating alliance to secure independence. Mugabe\u2019s fighters had forced a bloody stalemate on the battlefield, one that \u2013 just by pure paring down of numbers \u2013 the minority white population could not have sustained for ever. But the white army was not defeated. It took the advent of Margaret Thatcher as British prime minister in 1979, her foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, and the diplomacy of Kaunda and the Commonwealth secretary general, Shridath Ramphal \u2013 not to mention the co-operation of apartheid South Africa \u2013 to force negotiations at the end of 1979 that led to the transformation of Rhodesia into Zimbabwe. The white minority Rhodesian government, alarmed by the attrition of the war, contrived a coalition with moderate black nationalists. Thatcher, anxious to be rid of a diplomatic burden, was prepared to recognise the coalition, but despatched Carrington on a last effort to find a compromise to accommodate all parties. Kaunda and Ramphal persuaded Mugabe and Nkomo to come to the negotiating table, and South Africa, anxious not to have a militant black government on its borders \u2013 one which had taken the country by force \u2013 persuaded the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, to attend. The truce that resulted was followed by elections at the end of February 1980. Mugabe won a landslide victory. The newly enfranchised black majority recognised those who had fought for them. It was not the result Thatcher and Carrington had anticipated, but Mugabe\u2019s national address of reconciliation between black and white mollified almost everyone. Mugabe began his rule in Zimbabwe as an internationally acclaimed freedom fighter and apostle of reconciliation. Almost overnight, he became the new beacon of Africa. He remained in power for 37 years, fighting and winning every election during this time. His concern for electoral validation, even as he entered his last authoritarian phase, was in some senses the mark of a man who, despite all his intellect and ruthlessness, never quite got over the bodies sacrificed during his ascent. Those bodies accumulated as he held power. The west seemed unaware of the slaughters he instigated in Nkomo\u2019s powerbase, the two Matabeleland provinces of western Zimbabwe, from 1982 to 1987. On the suspicion that a rebellion was forming among disaffected former members of Nkomo\u2019s guerrilla army, Mugabe sent in North Korean-trained units to crush them. Exact figures are difficult to ascertain, but some tens of thousands of civilians were killed in a \u201cpolice action\u201d that turned into a bloody and gratuitous pogrom. Away from the Matabelelands, Mugabe\u2019s first years in power were regarded internationally as peaceful and democratic. He easily won the 1985 elections but in 1990 faced opposition from his former liberation colleague Edgar Tekere. Mugabe engaged in a series of intimidatory tactics that flawed an election that he would have won anyway. It set a tone of \u201cdemocracy if there is no serious opposition\u201d. There seemed no irony when, in 1991, the Commonwealth released the Harare Declaration on Human Rights (covering all member states), nor in 1992, when Mugabe lectured the Chinese on the desirability and harmlessness of opposition parties. But it was also in 1992 that the land question returned to haunt Mugabe. Carrington had pointedly refused to have land ownership included in the negotiations that led to independence in 1980, despite Mugabe\u2019s insistence that most of the landowning settlers were historically of British origin. Also, early efforts at negotiation in the mid-70s had included compensation for land nationalisation, paid from western sources. However, 1992 saw drought sweep Zimbabwe and questions of productivity of the land were swiftly caught up in those to do with ownership of it. Although the Land Acquisition Act of that year was never enforced, it should have been a warning sign to all, including the international community, that a gradual, phased and compensated programme of land nationalisation should be placed on the agenda before it was forced on to it. Instead, when Mugabe approached the newly elected Tony Blair about the issue in 1997, he received such a curt dismissal that an antipathy towards Blair became a burning element of Mugabe\u2019s feelings towards Britain. Some, like the Commonwealth secretary general of that period, Emeka Anyaoku, maintain that the land issue had been postponed in 1992 so as not to alarm white negotiators in South Africa, as that country made its final steps towards majority rule. After Carrington, the British had hoped to nudge the question of land ownership off the main agenda by small but regular funds for land nationalisation. John Major had ensured that this was the case in the early 1990s, but Blair adamantly refused any assurance of increase or even continuation. This was a lack of historical comprehension on Blair\u2019s part. Although Mugabe\u2019s latter-day views of historical need highlighted the land question, the struggle for independence was as much about racism, equality and freedom. Carrington thought he could sideline land while delivering an acceptable breakthrough on the other goals of the struggle. The British government argued that it could not afford large-scale compensation at that point, and Carrington had been given a hard time by the white delegation at the 1979 negotiations. But the land issue could not be kept off the agenda for ever. Two-thirds of the arable land of Zimbabwe was in white ownership, acquired by seizure and legislation in which black voices played no part. The argument of the white farmers would have rested on what they had done to make the land commercially productive \u2013 so the debate, had Britain been wise, should have been over compensation, but not over historical rights. However, it was the rights issue that, after 1997, Mugabe wheeled out with great literal force. Mugabe had always been committed intellectually to a vision of black culture having its historical moment. The achievement of the black personality in terms of both its heritage and its place in the modern world was of extreme importance to him. However, given a choice between the fulfilment of that heritage \u2013 and to Mugabe that increasingly came to mean ownership of the land \u2013 and place within modernity, then he was prepared to choose heritage. In many ways 1997 was the year that marked the beginning of the downturn of Zimbabwe. Although Mugabe had won the 1995 elections easily, the advent of the war veterans as a pressure group made itself felt soon afterwards. The economy was slowly but markedly deteriorating. Civil society began to campaign with increasing effect for a new constitution, and Mugabe began to express his immense distaste for the British legacy in Zimbabwe, based on both the land issue and what rapidly became a visceral animosity towards Blair. Had Mugabe retired in 1995, he would have been hailed internationally as a great leader. The slaughters in the Matabelelands would have been considered an unfortunate aberration. Now, as the century turned, Mugabe was well into his 70s. He finally seized the land, but bankrupted the country he had fought so hard to win, divided his own citizens, oppressed those who refused to support him, and created in the midst of a new national poverty a class of oligarchs who stole money from his \u201chistorical moment\u201d and supported him as much for their own gain as their deep belief in him and his vision. Land was gained, but equality and freedom lost. If the decline of Zimbabwe began in 1997, recovery with good management was still possible. Mugabe, however, was sucked into the war then raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This caused great expense, but it also helped him to consolidate the support of his generals as they were given free rein to plunder the mineral resources of the DRC. However, the public expense and other economic issues, coupled with Mugabe\u2019s increasingly authoritarian demeanour, prompted the creation of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), led by Tsvangirai, in 1999. It became immediately apparent that the new opposition party had a national following. Against all Mugabe\u2019s expectations, it defeated him in a referendum in early 2000 which he had called over constitutional issues, including an amendment to give the presidency even more power. It was his first defeat, and although it had not been at an election, Mugabe came to recognise the opposition\u2019s strength and was determined that, in elections to come, he would triumph over Tsvangirai and the MDC. Shortly after the referendum, the pro-Mugabe war veterans were unleashed to begin the seizure of white-owned farms, and administrative and financial chaos descended. For what Mugabe never factored in to his pastoral vision of African heritage was that the agricultural economy of his country was based, not on a romanticised sense of peasant ownership and what it could produce, but on an aggressive and highly modern agriculture industry that sold food and tobacco on the international markets. Mugabe and Zanu-PF won the 2000 parliamentary elections, then the 2002 presidential ones. He followed this with victory at the 2005 parliamentary polls. But he resorted increasingly to violence and vote-rigging. The violence could be naked, but the rigging was of a highly sophisticated nature and no one has yet uncovered all the details of how it was done. Away from polls, everything the MDC could throw at Mugabe \u2013 strikes and protests \u2013 was met by repression, heavy-handed police action and violence from hired thugs and paramilitaries. Tsvangirai was charged with treason and, though acquitted, a campaign of psychological harassment was unleashed on him. He began to make mistakes and the MDC split. A dispirited Tsvangirai then faced the combined presidential and parliamentary elections of 2008 with a split among MDC supporters. All popular wisdom and political punditry suggested that he would be crushed. Mugabe was supremely confident. But the ruination of the country had been such that the electorate insisted on change. By some estimates, Tsvangirai and the MDC won 56% of the vote. But when the pattern of results became apparent, Mugabe and his party panicked. Counting promptly stopped. There followed many weeks of painstaking recounts of the opposition\u2019s vote until it fell below 50%. A runoff was then declared for the presidency which prompted Mugabe to resort to further violence and intimidation. Tsvangirai withdrew in protest and Mugabe was declared the victor. He had stolen it, but the nature of the theft was such that, at last, other African countries would not stomach a pretence of such magnitude. South Africa\u2019s Mbeki intensified his mediation efforts to bring Mugabe and Tsvangirai together. It was a protracted twisting of arms that eventually led to a fractious power-sharing coalition. Mugabe remained president, his generals and hard men remained powerful and rich, while Tsvangirai was made prime minister and given the task of lifting Zimbabwe out of the economic mire that Mugabe had caused. Mugabe\u2019s party made life difficult for Tsvangirai at every step. Even so, Tsvangirai\u2019s efforts at government, including the appointment of Tendai Biti as finance minister, and Biti\u2019s wise ministrations of the economy, did bring stability to Zimbabwean financial transactions. And they allowed the consolidation of a Zimbabwean middle class that had been threatened by rampant hyper-inflation. But, despite a huge raft of appeals to surrounding presidents, Tsvangirai could not demilitarise Mugabe\u2019s hold on the election machinery, and the shadow of military power on society as a whole. The electorate, anxious to hold on to its new financial stability, were drawn once again to Mugabe\u2019s party in the 2013 elections, fearing chaos and military struggle if it was defeated. Tsvangirai, although impressive as an opposition leader, never really inspired as a prime minister. Although the 2013 elections were rigged to an extent, it was also clear that large numbers voted for Mugabe willingly, and that Tsvangirai had not done enough to break his iron grip on the institutions of Zimbabwe. He died in 2018. The presidency from 2013 onwards became an economic disaster. Mugabe began to concentrate increasingly on party matters, rather than national government. Obsessed with the possibility of plots against him, he purged the party of even his most prized lieutenants. Joice Mujuru, his vice-president, a war heroine and the widow of Solomon Mujuru \u2013 who died in mysterious circumstances in 2011 \u2013 was purged in December 2014. The economy began to plummet as Mugabe\u2019s plans to extend nationalisation from land to industry abruptly halted foreign direct investment of any sizeable nature. The stabilisation of the economy during the coalition years under Tsvangirai and Biti had depended on the substitution of the Zimbabwean currency by US dollars. Now, without investment, and increasingly without productivity \u2013 aided and abetted by an increase in corruption by Mugabe\u2019s militarised oligarchy \u2013 the dollars dried up. The country went through increasing periods when there were simply no physical dollars in everyday circulation. In the midst of this meltdown, citizen protest began to increase. Demands for salaries to be paid on time began to be transformed into a critique of corruption and, increasingly, of an old man in his 90s with no new ideas and a constant need for medical rejuvenation in a variety of foreign clinics. In the face of widening unrest and the loss of support from his war-veteran allies, Mugabe vowed to stay in power, insisting he would stand again for the presidency in 2018. It was not to be. Preoccupied with holding party factions in check both for the sake of a balance of power within Zanu-PF, and then increasingly to position his wife, Grace, for the succession, Mugabe failed to give attention to the economy and indeed began sabotaging his finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, by reinstating public servants whom Chinamasa had wanted to dismiss as part of a programme to curtail public expenditure. There were no plans to increase productivity or search for new markets. A bottle of cooking oil became cheaper to import from South Africa than its Zimbabwean production cost. The shortage of US dollars, introduced in 2009, meant the printing of bond notes that heralded the beginnings of new hyperinflation. When the generals moved against Mugabe, it was a move against mismanagement, the prospect of more of the same from his wife, and Mugabe\u2019s willingness to sacrifice a noted war veteran, Mnangagwa, to placate Grace and smooth the path for her ambitions. It was an ignominious downfall for someone who had risen so high from nothing. Born and raised at Kutama Mission, in Zvimba district, west of Harare (then Salisbury), Mugabe was a bookish child. His father, Gabriel, deserted the family when Robert was 10, leaving his mother, Bona, to bring up the boy and his five siblings. He was educated by Jesuits, who imbued in him a deep faith, before in 1949 he won a scholarship to Fort Hare University in Eastern Cape, South Africa \u2013 a private institution that accepted black students \u2013 following closely behind Nelson Mandela. An entire generation of future African leaders passed through its doors and emerged with a taste for learning and for resistance. It was not until the 1970s and his time in Mozambique that Mugabe became a crypto-Marxist. His belief was anchored in a stages-of-history view of the world, with black liberation constituting a critical stage. It was a cultural and, to an extent, racist view of history \u2013 the latter perhaps inevitable as a reaction to the climate of minority white-ruled Rhodesia. Many shared this view and a good number of Zimbabwean intellectuals stood by him for years. His death is unlikely to diminish the sense of enigma that surrounded him, with passionate mourning expected in many parts of Africa and a sense of good riddance among many in the west. Mugabe\u2019s domestic life was marked by tragedy and controversy. He met Sally Hayfron while teaching in Ghana and they married in 1961. Their only son, Michael Nhamodzenyika (\u201csuffering country\u201d in Shona), died aged three while Mugabe was in jail. He was denied compassionate release for the funeral and it is said this embittered his view of the white population. Sally died in 1992. He then married his secretary Grace Marufu, who had borne him two children, Bona and Robert Jr, while he was still married to Sally. A third child, Chatunga, came once they were wedded. Grace was an extravagant figure, nicknamed both \u201cDis Grace\u201d and \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d \u2013 almost the perfect symbol of the oligarchic class around Mugabe \u2013 but she was loyal to her husband. However, when it became clear that Tsvangirai had won in 2008, but before the decision to rig the result was taken, she pleaded with Mugabe to stand down for the sake of their children, who were being taunted at school because their father \u201chad ruined the country\u201d. After the 2013 elections her demeanour became more and more preoccupied with maintaining her husband in power before she became involved in the struggle for the succession of an increasingly frail old man \u2013 seeking that succession for herself. With the death of Mugabe, questions of his enigma remain. He was, however, a nationalist leader with moments of greatness. He had a far more intellectual sense of African destiny than his critics would acknowledge. He would, in some ways, have made a better professor than a president but, as a president, he clung to power far too long. He achieved liberation and created a tragedy. He is survived by Grace, and their children, Bona, Robert and Chatunga. \u2022 Robert Gabriel Mugabe, politician, born 21 February 1924; died 6 September 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2019 because an earlier version referred to Matabeleland as being in eastern Zimbabwe. This has been corrected to say western Zimbabwe.",

Juventus could fill the gap in their forward line with Leverkusen\u2019s Kai Havertz, although they face a battle with Liverpool for the German up-and-comer. Juve are also in the market for a new goalkeeper, with David de Gea very much fitting the bill. Manchester United are eyeing up Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Jan Oblak to replace him. United must also convince Paul Pogba to sign a new contract, and tie up a move for PSG\u2019s Thomas Meunier. Don\u2019t expect him to arrive in January, though \u2013 the full-back doesn\u2019t fancy a winter move: \u201cI have the impression when transfers are done in January that they are not thought out, but rather a question of necessity.\u201d Shh, Thomas! You\u2019ll give the game away! Another player that Spurs failed to land this summer was Bruno Fernandes \u2013 with Sporting\u2019s president claiming that unrealistic add-ons scuppered a deal. According to Frederico Varandas, Spurs\u2019 offer was \u201c\u20ac45 million, plus \u20ac20m in bonuses for winning the Premier League and Champions League. Those are difficult objectives.\u201d Ouch. Said objectives might look slightly more realistic if Spurs can convince Christian Eriksen to sign that new contract, with Atl\u00e9tico and United hoping he doesn\u2019t. Contract negotiations ahoy across North London, too, with Arsenal trying to tie down genuinely likeable strike duo Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. The Frenchman is reportedly attracting interest from Barcelona, who could team the striker up with compatriot Antoine Griezmann, now Luis Su\u00e1rez is getting on a bit. Staying with Bar\u00e7a, some shock news \u2013 Lionel Messi has the run of the place. Reports have emerged that his Barcelona contract contains an opt-out, applicable at the end of every season \u2013 not that he\u2019s planning on using it. Crikey, we\u2019re almost out of time and haven\u2019t even mentioned Real Madrid. Gah, too late. Gareth Bale is back in Zizou\u2019s good books and is expected to play a big part this season \u2013 before Real go all out for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 next summer. It\u2019s tough being an elite footballer these days \u2013 just ask Philippe Coutinho, who was reportedly offered to Manchester City on loan after Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s injury. Pep said thanks, but no thanks. Elsewhere, Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen is attracting interest from Newcastle, Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s Dani Olmo is unhappy he wasn\u2019t being allowed to join Wolves in the summer, and Fulham \u2013 who may have a bit of a problem \u2013 have signed a player three days after the window closed. Chelsea defender Michael Hector will train with the Championship club this autumn, before signing officially in January.",

The title\u2019s taken from his recent autobiography, Let Love Have the Last Word, with both focusing on forgiveness in trying times. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.thinkcommon.com/\">O2 Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, W12, Tuesday 10; O2 Ritz Manchester, Thursday 12 September</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Kit Downes Quartet</h2> <p>Snape Maltings\u2019 adventurous Festival of New spans experimental artists from Dutch improvisers Tin Men and the Telephone to hip-hop poets and multimedia artists.

In the Name of the Earth is certainly a major piece, involving 600 singers from eight London choirs stationed around the auditorium, as they intone a litany of natural wonders: the names of rivers, lakes, mountains and deserts. It\u2019s an immersive experience and, in its final moments, the audience are invited to join in singing the work\u2019s main theme. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2019/prom-66-in-the-name-of-the-earth/\">Royal Albert Hall, SW7 Sunday 8 September</a></em></p> <h2>Lammermuir festival</h2> <p>As ever, this year\u2019s programme at the Lammermuir festival, the 10th, is dominated by chamber music, with the period-instrument Quatuor Mosa\u00efques giving three recitals and the Dunedin Consort giving four. But there are also Schubert\u2019s three song cycles from baritone Roderick Williams, the three last Beethoven piano sonatas from Steven Osborne, a double bill of Mascagni and Wolf-Ferrari from Scottish Opera and the premiere of Prometheus Symphony by Stuart MacRae in a concert by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.lammermuirfestival.co.uk/\">Various venues, Lothian, Friday 13 to 22 September</a></em></p> <h2>Britten Gala</h2> <p>Song cycles by Britten open the Wigmore\u2019s new season. The first concert includes four, all with James Baillieu as the pianist joined by a different soloist. Soprano Louise Alder sings On This Island, mezzo Christine Rice A Charm of Lullabies, while tenor Allan Clayton has the Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo and baritone James Newby the Sonnets and Proverbs of William Blake. <br><em><a href=\"https://bachtrack.com/concert-listing/wigmore-hall/britten-gala/13-september-2019/19-30\">Wigmore Hall, W1, Friday 13 September</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a065ff30eb0ebcb18e0aa038e067005e1607a12c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a065ff30eb0ebcb18e0aa038e067005e1607a12c/0_78_3619_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mona Hatoum\u2019s Quarters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mona Hatoum\u2019s Quarters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist and MdbK Leipzig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>William Blake</h2> <p>To call this great poet and artist a visionary is probably tautological because he invented the modern idea of art as inner vision. That has made him not only a giant of the Romantic age but an influence on every creator who has ever reverenced a tiger or taken a drug, as this show of more than 300 works aims to demonstrate. Break on through to the other side \u2026 <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/william-blake-artist\">Tate Britain, SW1 Wednesday 11 September to 2 February</a></em></p> <h2>Mona Hatoum</h2> <p>William Blake used print-making and prophecy to fight the power; Hatoum uses everything from steel to human hair to suggest the tensions of today\u2019s world. Globes are a recurring image in this show, covered with iron filings or bombsite rubble to express the trauma of the 21st century. A vision of violence and ruin. <br><em><a href=\"https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/mona_hatoum_bermondsey_2019\">White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, Thursday 12 September to 3 November</a></em></p> <h2>Peter Doig</h2> <p>In his 60th year, you could say Doig is entering his mature phase: an era of poised, contemporary mastery. His dreamlike, imaginary Caribbean scenes mix photographically accurate details of places and people with stellar colours Blake might have loved. Deep greens and blues and painful yellows create a poetic landscape of seaside pleasure and pain. Doig is sailing his canoe into ever more mysterious waters. <br><em><a href=\"http://michaelwerner.com/exhibition/5790/information\">Michael Werner Gallery, W1, to 16 November</a></em></p> <h2>A Rothschild Treasury</h2> <p>This is a cabinet of curiosities, a gathering of strange and wondrous items collected by the Rothschild family since the 19th century. In Queen Victoria\u2019s anniversary year, it reveals her friendship with this dynasty through a seal and bracelet given by her to Alice Charlotte von Rothschild. Other treasures range from a Roman cameo portrait to a nautilus goblet that belonged to gothic novelist William Beckford. <br><em><a href=\"https://waddesdon.org.uk/whats-on/a-rothschild-treasury/\">Waddesdon Manor, Aylesbury, Sat to 27 October</a></em></p> <h2>Dora Maurer</h2> <p>The abstract paintings of this Hungarian conceptualist are free and joyous in a way that resembles Bridget Riley or Ellsworth Kelly. This show coincides with a retrospective at Tate Modern but I am glad to see more of these big, bold assaults on space. Maurer sends colours hurtling out of any conceivable frame to smear themselves across walls and around corners. Uplifting. <br><em><a href=\"https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/dora_maurer_bermondsey_2019\">White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, Thursday 12 September to 3 November</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83956631805247a155aa049892d13a8c6e0a1a78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83956631805247a155aa049892d13a8c6e0a1a78/50_36_1436_861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Man in the White Suit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Man in the White Suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theatre Royal Bath</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Big: The Musical</h2> <p>Big (\u2019scuse the pun) cheesy musicals are hugely tempting at the moment: we need a little escapism from our theatre. This week\u2019s light-hearted offering is a West End premiere adapting the classic 80s Tom Hanks film about a 12-year-old boy who becomes trapped in an adult\u2019s body. Jay McGuiness stars alongside Matthew Kelly, Wendi Peters and Kimberley Walsh. <br><em><a href=\"http://dominion.theatre-tickets.com/big-the-musical\">Dominion Theatre, W1</a><strong><a href=\"http://dominion.theatre-tickets.com/big-the-musical\"> </a></strong><a href=\"http://dominion.theatre-tickets.com/big-the-musical\">to 7 November</a></em></p> <h2>Faith, Hope and Charity</h2> <p>Alexander Zeldin makes his very own particular brand of theatre, focusing on those living on the peripheries of our communities and based on real-life research. Faith, Hope and Charity is set in a rundown community hall and, if it\u2019s anything like Beyond Caring and Love, it will be difficult, powerful theatre. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/faith-hope-and-charity\">National Theatre: Dorfman, SE1, Monday 9 September to 12 October</a></em></p> <h2>HighTide festival</h2> <p>Some of the very best plays from the Edinburgh fringe are coming to the HighTide new writing festival. A bunch of critically lauded shows will feature, including Queer House with Mika Johnson\u2019s Pink Lemonade, Margaret Perry\u2019s Collapsible and Charlotte Josephine\u2019s Pops. There is also the premiere of Sophie Ellerby\u2019s LIT (pictured), about a teenage girl looking for love in all the wrong places. It is a product of HighTide\u2019s First Commissions programme and is directed by Stef O\u2019Driscoll. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.hightide.org.uk/\">Various venues, Aldeburgh, Tuesday 10 to 15 September</a></em></p> <h2>A Doll\u2019s House</h2> <p>Another Doll\u2019s House, another intriguing twist on Ibsen\u2019s classic play about a woman struggling to break free of her domestic trappings. In Tanika Gupta\u2019s new version, Nora becomes Niru (played by Anjana Vasan), a young Bengali woman married to an English colonial bureaucrat. The show marks Rachel O\u2019Riordan\u2019s directorial debut as artistic director of the Lyric. <br><em><a href=\"https://lyric.co.uk/shows/a-dolls-house/\">Lyric Hammersmith, W6, to 5 October</a></em></p> <h2>The Man in the White Suit</h2> <p>The Ealing comedy film has been adapted by Sean Foley, who also directs. Stephen Mangan plays Sidney Stratton, a man whose life spirals out of control after he invents a fabric that never gets dirty, with Kara Tointon as his faithful sidekick. If it sounds silly that\u2019s because it really, really is. This is the second collaboration between Mangan and Foley, following a cracking version of Jeeves and Wooster. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/the-man-in-the-white-suit/\">Theatre Royal Bath, to 21;</a> <a href=\"http://wyndhams.theatre-tickets.com/the-man-in-the-white-suit\">Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, WC2, 25 September to 11 January</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f25db4d478f732f84a8760042a0e355b8400dede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f25db4d478f732f84a8760042a0e355b8400dede/0_191_4912_4253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Astana Ballet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"866\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Astana Ballet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tea\u010b Damsa: Swan Lake/Loch na hEala</h2> <p>A stunning work from Michael Keegan-Dolan that touches on a seemingly impossible combination of themes \u2013 mythology, depression, urban regeneration, the Celtic Tiger, the crimes of the Catholic church, Nordic folk music and Marius Petipa\u2019s ballet Swan Lake \u2013 and turns them into an excoriating yet uplifting piece of dance-theatre. <br><em><a href=\"http://teacdamsa.com/touring/\">Cork Opera House, Tuesday 10 to Thursday 12 September</a></em></p> <h2>Astana Ballet</h2> <p>Kazakhstan\u2019s leading ballet company, no less, makes its UK debut.

XOYO, EC2, Friday 13 September Common Rapper, actor, philanthropist, writer, activist and Microsoft TV advert mainstay Lonnie Lynn, AKA Common, returns to music with this brief UK jaunt in support of his 12th album, Let Love. The title\u2019s taken from his recent autobiography, Let Love Have the Last Word, with both focusing on forgiveness in trying times. O2 Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, W12, Tuesday 10; O2 Ritz Manchester, Thursday 12 September MC Kit Downes Quartet Snape Maltings\u2019 adventurous Festival of New spans experimental artists from Dutch improvisers Tin Men and the Telephone to hip-hop poets and multimedia artists. There\u2019s also ingeniously imaginative pianist Kit Downes, here adding to a growing collage of live material for an upcoming ECM album with saxophonist Tom Challenger, cellist Lucy Railton and drummer Seb Rochford. Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Saturday 7 September JF Three of the best ... classical concerts In the Name of the Earth No contemporary composer has made environmental issues more central to his music than John Luther Adams, and a Proms season with the environment as one of its themes was bound to programme one of his major works. In the Name of the Earth is certainly a major piece, involving 600 singers from eight London choirs stationed around the auditorium, as they intone a litany of natural wonders: the names of rivers, lakes, mountains and deserts. It\u2019s an immersive experience and, in its final moments, the audience are invited to join in singing the work\u2019s main theme. Royal Albert Hall, SW7 Sunday 8 September Lammermuir festival As ever, this year\u2019s programme at the Lammermuir festival, the 10th, is dominated by chamber music, with the period-instrument Quatuor Mosa\u00efques giving three recitals and the Dunedin Consort giving four. But there are also Schubert\u2019s three song cycles from baritone Roderick Williams, the three last Beethoven piano sonatas from Steven Osborne, a double bill of Mascagni and Wolf-Ferrari from Scottish Opera and the premiere of Prometheus Symphony by Stuart MacRae in a concert by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Various venues, Lothian, Friday 13 to 22 September Britten Gala Song cycles by Britten open the Wigmore\u2019s new season. The first concert includes four, all with James Baillieu as the pianist joined by a different soloist. Soprano Louise Alder sings On This Island, mezzo Christine Rice A Charm of Lullabies, while tenor Allan Clayton has the Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo and baritone James Newby the Sonnets and Proverbs of William Blake. Wigmore Hall, W1, Friday 13 September AC Five of the best ... exhibitions William Blake To call this great poet and artist a visionary is probably tautological because he invented the modern idea of art as inner vision. That has made him not only a giant of the Romantic age but an influence on every creator who has ever reverenced a tiger or taken a drug, as this show of more than 300 works aims to demonstrate. Break on through to the other side \u2026 Tate Britain, SW1 Wednesday 11 September to 2 February Mona Hatoum William Blake used print-making and prophecy to fight the power; Hatoum uses everything from steel to human hair to suggest the tensions of today\u2019s world. Globes are a recurring image in this show, covered with iron filings or bombsite rubble to express the trauma of the 21st century. A vision of violence and ruin. White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, Thursday 12 September to 3 November Peter Doig In his 60th year, you could say Doig is entering his mature phase: an era of poised, contemporary mastery. His dreamlike, imaginary Caribbean scenes mix photographically accurate details of places and people with stellar colours Blake might have loved. Deep greens and blues and painful yellows create a poetic landscape of seaside pleasure and pain. Doig is sailing his canoe into ever more mysterious waters. Michael Werner Gallery, W1, to 16 November A Rothschild Treasury This is a cabinet of curiosities, a gathering of strange and wondrous items collected by the Rothschild family since the 19th century. In Queen Victoria\u2019s anniversary year, it reveals her friendship with this dynasty through a seal and bracelet given by her to Alice Charlotte von Rothschild. Other treasures range from a Roman cameo portrait to a nautilus goblet that belonged to gothic novelist William Beckford. Waddesdon Manor, Aylesbury, Sat to 27 October Dora Maurer The abstract paintings of this Hungarian conceptualist are free and joyous in a way that resembles Bridget Riley or Ellsworth Kelly. This show coincides with a retrospective at Tate Modern but I am glad to see more of these big, bold assaults on space. Maurer sends colours hurtling out of any conceivable frame to smear themselves across walls and around corners. Uplifting. White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, Thursday 12 September to 3 November JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Big: The Musical Big (\u2019scuse the pun) cheesy musicals are hugely tempting at the moment: we need a little escapism from our theatre. This week\u2019s light-hearted offering is a West End premiere adapting the classic 80s Tom Hanks film about a 12-year-old boy who becomes trapped in an adult\u2019s body. Jay McGuiness stars alongside Matthew Kelly, Wendi Peters and Kimberley Walsh. Dominion Theatre, W1 to 7 November Faith, Hope and Charity Alexander Zeldin makes his very own particular brand of theatre, focusing on those living on the peripheries of our communities and based on real-life research. Faith, Hope and Charity is set in a rundown community hall and, if it\u2019s anything like Beyond Caring and Love, it will be difficult, powerful theatre. National Theatre: Dorfman, SE1, Monday 9 September to 12 October HighTide festival Some of the very best plays from the Edinburgh fringe are coming to the HighTide new writing festival. A bunch of critically lauded shows will feature, including Queer House with Mika Johnson\u2019s Pink Lemonade, Margaret Perry\u2019s Collapsible and Charlotte Josephine\u2019s Pops. There is also the premiere of Sophie Ellerby\u2019s LIT (pictured), about a teenage girl looking for love in all the wrong places. It is a product of HighTide\u2019s First Commissions programme and is directed by Stef O\u2019Driscoll. Various venues, Aldeburgh, Tuesday 10 to 15 September A Doll\u2019s House Another Doll\u2019s House, another intriguing twist on Ibsen\u2019s classic play about a woman struggling to break free of her domestic trappings. In Tanika Gupta\u2019s new version, Nora becomes Niru (played by Anjana Vasan), a young Bengali woman married to an English colonial bureaucrat. The show marks Rachel O\u2019Riordan\u2019s directorial debut as artistic director of the Lyric. Lyric Hammersmith, W6, to 5 October The Man in the White Suit The Ealing comedy film has been adapted by Sean Foley, who also directs. Stephen Mangan plays Sidney Stratton, a man whose life spirals out of control after he invents a fabric that never gets dirty, with Kara Tointon as his faithful sidekick. If it sounds silly that\u2019s because it really, really is. This is the second collaboration between Mangan and Foley, following a cracking version of Jeeves and Wooster. Theatre Royal Bath, to 21; Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, WC2, 25 September to 11 January MG Three of the best ... dance shows Tea\u010b Damsa: Swan Lake/Loch na hEala A stunning work from Michael Keegan-Dolan that touches on a seemingly impossible combination of themes \u2013 mythology, depression, urban regeneration, the Celtic Tiger, the crimes of the Catholic church, Nordic folk music and Marius Petipa\u2019s ballet Swan Lake \u2013 and turns them into an excoriating yet uplifting piece of dance-theatre. Cork Opera House, Tuesday 10 to Thursday 12 September Astana Ballet Kazakhstan\u2019s leading ballet company, no less, makes its UK debut. Formed in 2012, the company performs an eclectic programme of contemporary and neo-classical ballets and folk dance, including a piece inspired by \u00c9dith Piaf and one based on Oscar Wilde\u2019s Salome. Royal Opera House: Linbury Theatre, WC2, Thursday 12 to 14 September Stuart Waters: RockBottom A former dancer with Protein and Motionhouse, Stuart Waters\u2019s choreographic debut is a painfully raw autobiographical solo about mental health and the dangers of chemsex. In an intimate, no-holds-barred piece of dance-theatre, he explores addiction and recovery.

The panel of three judges upheld on Thursday a previous decision by a lower court in British Columbia, clearing the way for the teen to continue his hormone treatment. The case centres on a 14-year-old from Vancouver, who started publicly identifying as a male at 11. After a suicide attempt and meetings with medical professionals, the teen requested hormone therapy to transition from female to male, but his father took legal action to stop the process. \u201cI will be stranded between looking and sounding feminine and looking and sounding masculine. I would feel like a freak,\u201d the teenager wrote in an affidavit which was read out in court on Tuesday. The bitter fight over hormone treatment for a child has also became a debate over parental rights, freedom of expression and informed consent. Underscoring the broader implications of the court\u2019s decision, six groups \u2013 including LGBTQ advocacy organizations and conservative free speech activists \u2013 have been granted the right to provide submissions on behalf of the litigants. Eighteen lawyers have taken part in the three-day hearing, including those representing public health officials, the local school board, as well as the teenager, his mother and his father. A publication ban prevents the identification of any family members or experts testifying. In February a lower court ruled that the Infants Act, which gives wide latitude to a minor\u2019s ability to consent to medical procedures, permits the teen to receive hormone therapy at a Vancouver hospital. The boy, who has the support of his mother, began taking hormones in March and now feels \u201camazing\u201d as a result of the treatment, his lawyers told the British Columbia court of appeals, the province\u2019s highest court. In addition to an improved self-image, he no longer has suicidal thoughts, they said. But his father is determined to block the continuation of the hormone treatment, arguing that the lower court rushed prematurely to judgment.

The child\u2019s name and birth certificate have been changed to reflect the fact he identifies as male. The father is also barred from speaking to media about the case due to a separate court ruling. The father and his legal team have cast the case in terms of personal liberties, arguing in court filings that the court\u2019s order that he use his child\u2019s chosen identity amounts to \u201ctotalitarian interference\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a case about freedom of speech and the freedom to parent,\u201d Carey Linde, the father\u2019s lawyer, told the Guardian.

      "body": "<p>It was Caverns of Khafka for me. Discovered one rainy afternoon in a Debenhams bargain bin, this weird Commodore 64 dungeon exploration game totally freaked me out with its funeral dirge soundtrack and horrific screeching bats. When I tried to tell my friends about it, they looked confused and concerned \u2013 no one else had ever heard of it. I started to think I was the only person in the world who had explored this disorientating adventure \u2013 it took on a sinister air.</p> <p>In the pre-internet era of gaming, it was common to stumble upon these hidden oddities. The industry was more disorganised with smaller publishers distributing games that were often programmed by eccentric loners, and there was only a handful of specialist magazines to call them out. Games were snuck onto the shelves of newsagents and video rental shops, or into car boot sales and computer fairs, and you often had no idea what they were until you bought them and loaded them up. And by then it was far too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69fc59eef4b36af46386af683ac2f63f5bb456a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69fc59eef4b36af46386af683ac2f63f5bb456a1/87_21_1118_671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caverns of Khafka... not as terrifying as I remember\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caverns of Khafka... not as terrifying as I remember</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Commodore 64</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve only met a few people who played the 1983 BBC Micro game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny%27s_Garden\">Granny\u2019s Garden</a>, but none of them can forget it. It was billed as an educational puzzle adventure, but every time you messed up, a hideous blocky image of a witch appeared on screen like some sort of demonic Ceefax page, accompanied by the message \u201cHa ha! Now I\u2019ve got you!\u201d Young victims of this terrifying game usually suffered alone because no one else in their school could afford a BBC Micro.</p> <p>When I asked on Twitter if anyone else could remember being psychologically scarred by some awful obscure game that no one else had ever seen, I was inundated with responses. The author Julie Mayhew recalled the creepy prison game Stir Crazy, in which you played an incarcerated skinhead peeling potatoes to unsettlingly jaunty music. Game designer Alex Darby dredged up the memory of uncanny Commodore 64 adventure Avalon, and its sequel Dragontorc. \u201cThey scared the crap out of me, to the extent I had to stop playing them,\u201d he admits. Another game designer, Rhodri Broadbent, introduced us to the BBC Micro game Boffin, in which players were terrorised by a giant spider, which stood stock-still until the player strayed too close. \u201cThe scariest stage of any video game I\u2019ve played,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd the sound...

Then there was the ZX Spectrum game Streaker, which featured a mugging victim running around an alien city, naked, looking for his clothes. \u201cA mechanic who worked at my dad\u2019s garage gave it to me on a blank white cassette tape,\u201d Twitter user @maxscottslade told me, further adding to the seedy vibe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d401c493fb72068d300e1c5ce847f1efa4c6487c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d401c493fb72068d300e1c5ce847f1efa4c6487c/0_4_320_192/320.jpg\" alt=\"Weird Dreams\" width=\"320\" height=\"192\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weird Dreams... starts with your near-death and just gets weirder</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rainbird</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These experiences weren\u2019t restricted to the 8-bit era.

      "bodyText": "It was Caverns of Khafka for me. Discovered one rainy afternoon in a Debenhams bargain bin, this weird Commodore 64 dungeon exploration game totally freaked me out with its funeral dirge soundtrack and horrific screeching bats. When I tried to tell my friends about it, they looked confused and concerned \u2013 no one else had ever heard of it. I started to think I was the only person in the world who had explored this disorientating adventure \u2013 it took on a sinister air. In the pre-internet era of gaming, it was common to stumble upon these hidden oddities. The industry was more disorganised with smaller publishers distributing games that were often programmed by eccentric loners, and there was only a handful of specialist magazines to call them out. Games were snuck onto the shelves of newsagents and video rental shops, or into car boot sales and computer fairs, and you often had no idea what they were until you bought them and loaded them up. And by then it was far too late. I\u2019ve only met a few people who played the 1983 BBC Micro game Granny\u2019s Garden, but none of them can forget it. It was billed as an educational puzzle adventure, but every time you messed up, a hideous blocky image of a witch appeared on screen like some sort of demonic Ceefax page, accompanied by the message \u201cHa ha! Now I\u2019ve got you!\u201d Young victims of this terrifying game usually suffered alone because no one else in their school could afford a BBC Micro. When I asked on Twitter if anyone else could remember being psychologically scarred by some awful obscure game that no one else had ever seen, I was inundated with responses. The author Julie Mayhew recalled the creepy prison game Stir Crazy, in which you played an incarcerated skinhead peeling potatoes to unsettlingly jaunty music. Game designer Alex Darby dredged up the memory of uncanny Commodore 64 adventure Avalon, and its sequel Dragontorc. \u201cThey scared the crap out of me, to the extent I had to stop playing them,\u201d he admits. Another game designer, Rhodri Broadbent, introduced us to the BBC Micro game Boffin, in which players were terrorised by a giant spider, which stood stock-still until the player strayed too close. \u201cThe scariest stage of any video game I\u2019ve played,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd the sound... THE SOUND when it starts to move.\u201d Other examples of cursed games from the 1980s include Mad Nurse, where you had to look after some babies in a hospital, but if you left them alone too long they\u2019d stick their fingers in plug sockets and get electrocuted. Then there was the ZX Spectrum game Streaker, which featured a mugging victim running around an alien city, naked, looking for his clothes. \u201cA mechanic who worked at my dad\u2019s garage gave it to me on a blank white cassette tape,\u201d Twitter user @maxscottslade told me, further adding to the seedy vibe. These experiences weren\u2019t restricted to the 8-bit era. Twitter user @odeanna recalled an Atari ST game she found on a magazine demo disc: \u201cIt was some kind of flying game. I\u2019d played it loads of times and then one time I lost all control and the plane landed itself. A tiny pixelated man climbed out and had a wee. Never quite got over that.\u201d The Amiga game Weird Dreams was a literal nightmare simulator in which the player was trapped in the unconscious mind of a dying patient. \u201cThat was a trip for my nine-year-old brain,\u201d says Xbox social marketing manager, Graeme Boyd. The original PlayStation was inundated with weird, traumatising games because the console was so successful, game development was still relatively inexpensive and European publishers were enthusiastically importing Japanese titles by the skip-load, with questionable quality control. There was the deeply unsettling gothic adventure Koudelka, a nightmarish tale of priests and psychics, set in\u2026 Aberystwyth. Journalist and author Simon Parkin also recalls The Book of Watermarks, an eerie Shakespeare-inspired adventure made all the more horrifying by the fact that its soundtrack was inspired by Enya. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone else who played it, but it stayed with me for years,\u201d he says, before quickly adding, \u201cIt definitely existed,\u201d as though attempting to convince himself rather than me. The FMV-led horror game Dark Tales: From the Lost Soul was so terrifying and so obscure, it has almost taken on the feel of the videotape in the Ring movies. Indeed, there are some games that have become legendary for their unsettling effects, even though they may never have existed at all. A trippy and disorientating 1981 arcade title, Polybius, was rumoured to be a psychological experiment run by the US government and has since been dismissed by many as an urban legend.

His novel <em>Lie With Me</em> (<em>Arr\u00eate avec tes mensonges</em> in French, which is more like \u201cstop your lying\u201d), is a bestseller in France, and a film is already in the making; now it\u2019s been translated into very readable English by the actor and writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/07/molly-ringwald-revisiting-the-breakfast-club-was-troubling\" title=\"\">Molly Ringwald</a>.</p> <p>Besson has sometimes drawn on the lives of real individuals \u2013 Arthur Rimbaud, Marcel Proust, James Dean \u2013 for his novels, and he\u2019s apparently made this one out of his own adolescent love story. <em>Lie With Me </em>is set in the same small town in south-western France where he grew up, and is dedicated to a Thomas Andrieu who died in 2016, just as the character Thomas Andrieu does in the novel. The narrator is Philippe Besson, a successful writer living in Paris, remembering his adolescence.

Philippe\u2019s father is the headmaster of a primary school; Thomas\u2019s has a small dairy farm and sells the produce of his vineyard to local cognac distilleries, while his mother comes from a family of Spanish migrant labourers.

He assumes that Thomas is straight, and oblivious to him \u2013 that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know me at all\u201d. Philippe is clear already that he\u2019s gay, and although he doesn\u2019t mind being different (\u201cI wouldn\u2019t follow packs.

One amazing day in the playground, however, it turns out that Thomas has noticed Philippe after all, and has been cherishing a secret passion for him, precisely because he\u2019s different. \u201cBecause you are not like all the others, because I don\u2019t see anyone but you and you don\u2019t even realise it \u2026 Because you will leave and we will stay.\u201d There follow sexual encounters in the secret places Thomas knows: the locker room at the basketball court, a shed next to the football field, eventually in Philippe\u2019s teenage bedroom. The sex is raw and transforming, but they don\u2019t talk much \u2013 in public Thomas won\u2019t admit to knowing Philippe.

      "bodyText": "An Australian 60 Minutes promo for a story about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has prompted an outcry, with celebrities in the UK and the US slamming the program for using racist British commentator Katie Hopkins to attack the young royal. Hopkins, who can\u2019t get a job in Britain now, once compared African migrants crossing the Mediterranean to \u201ccockroaches\u201d and called for gunboats to stop migrants reaching their destination. TV presenter Jameela Jamil, actress Mia Farrow and journalist Reham Khan joined 9,000 others who replied to the tweet about the promo this week. Hopkins, who has aligned herself with the far-right media since losing her column in the Daily Mail, calls Meghan \u201ca no-one\u201d who \u201cwears bad clothes\u201d and does nothing but \u201cglow\u201d. Other interviewees say the duchess is manipulative, a fiend, a monster and a hypocrite. \u201cFrom adored to insufferable in less than a year,\u201d 60 Minutes says. \u201cWhat went wrong for Meghan, and how it affects hubby Harry.\u201d What went wrong for Nine\u2019s flagship 60 Minutes and its highest-paid journalist, Karl Stefanovic, may be a better question. Once a renowned current affairs program, this may be remembered as the moment Sunday 60 Minutes jumped the shark. And Stefanovic, the former Today host who has sold himself as a serious journalist and interviewer, is not going to rebuild his career on this sordid tale. Former Oz writer gets new gig There\u2019s been a happy ending for Rick Morton, the Australian\u2019s social affairs writer who resigned after dropping a bucket on the Rupert Murdoch organ at a university forum for journalism students. Morton has been signed by the Saturday Paper as its senior reporter and will start his new role on Monday, editor Maddison Connaughton told The Weekly Beast. The author of the acclaimed memoir One Hundred Years of Dirt was chatting to students at the University of Technology, Sydney, when he revealed some of the secrets of working at the Australian, such as knowing where the \u201ceditorial line is at the paper\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not always a Murdoch line; it\u2019s just that Murdoch hires editors who are very much like him.\u201d Not long after dropping that truth bomb, Morton was out the door. He has already made a splash at the Saturday Paper with a story \u201cMurdoch media fuels far-right recruitment\u201d, which was roundly attacked by the News Corp army last month, including columnist Nick Cater, who called it a \u201cvile anti-Murdoch hate speech dog whistle\u201d. ABC on a Pacific dive When the photojournalist Ben Bohane won the $10,000 Sean Dorney grant for Pacific journalism this year, he criticised the under-reporting of the Pacific by the Australian media. \u201cHonestly, our news editors are failing the Australian people by not prioritising more reporting from the Pacific,\u201d Bohane said. The grant is named after the legendary Sean Dorney who covered Papua New Guinea and the region, primarily for the ABC, between 1975 and 2014. The ABC has an Asia-Pacific newsroom in Melbourne, which produces stories on the region and files for the radio program Pacific Beat; the broadcaster also has a correspondent in PNG, Natalie Whiting. But the ABC is about to downgrade its expertise in Pacific journalism by putting four of the journalists from the Asia-Pacific newsroom into a notorious \u201cshark pool\u201d \u2013 a process of assessing their skills and performance against one another that has been widely condemned by staff and unions. Only two will emerge \u2013 the other two will be made redundant.

Nine\u2019s dinner heartburn It took almost two days and a near revolt by print journalists for the chief executive of Nine Entertainment, Hugh Marks, to admit it was a mistake to host the $10,000-a-head Liberal party fundraiser. Even then, Marks did not come out and make the statement himself, leaving it to the group executive editor, James Chessell, to tell staff the event was \u201cregrettable\u201d because many staff felt it could \u201ctemporarily tarnish our reputation for independence\u201d.

In fact, the charter was adopted by the Age in March 1988 and the board of John Fairfax in May 1988, but was not adopted by the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sun Herald and the Australian Financial Review until February 1991.

And that on top of \u201c<a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2019/09/05/josh-frydenberg-blames-rba-recession/\">miserable</a>\u201d productivity growth and rising unemployment, the culmination of the ongoing policy disaster in the Murray-Darling is that crops are failing and farmers are warning <a href=\"https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-05/farmers-shoppers-warned-of-impact-of-murray-darling-basin-dry/11477182?pfmredir=sm\">the price of our food will go up</a>.</p> <p>Of course the government have dug out the props and costumes to stage a culture war. One wonders if the unemployed were picked as villains because the Sri Lankan family from Biloela reminded everyone too much of their favourite neighbours for a \u201cbe scared of refugees\u201d theme to work. Not to mention there\u2019s no dramatic irony quite as powerful as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/having-a-constant-pool-of-unemployed-workers-is-deliberate-policy\">punishing your victims for the proof</a> they provide of your cruelty. </p> <p>But what is surprising \u2013 for some \u2013 is the Liberals choosing to revive this particular ghastly play. It was the Abbott iteration of this same government that mooted drug tests for welfare recipients in 2014. Condemned by medical experts, addiction specialists and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/05/does-the-coalition-understand-its-own-policies-evidence-says-no\">evidence of the policy\u2019s disastrous failure</a> in both Florida and New Zealand, Australians were treated to the sight of Kevin Andrews being informed that Abbott had dropped the policy during the very ABC live interview into which he\u2019d been sent to defend it.</p> <p>My message to those shocked by the event is that they really should know by now that this is a government that never met a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jul/31/the-angus-taylor-grassland-affair-so-whats-the-story-video-explainer\">mistake they couldn\u2019t make twice</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/04/cannabis-prohibition-doesnt-work-anywhere-its-new-zealands-turn-to-legalise-it\">Cannabis prohibition doesn't work anywhere. It's New Zealand's turn to legalise it | Helen Clark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This being said, I\u2019ll admit that Morrison\u2019s pursuit of drug-testing surprised me. Not because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a calcified, uncaring relic who mouths crudely cribbed biblical conservatism in lieu of both policy depth and a human conscience, delivering a prime ministerial performance that to date amounts to little more than impersonating John Howard at an interminable political improv night \u2013 because I do, he is, he does and it probably always will. It\u2019s that \u2013 as the New Zealand experiment revealed \u2013 for the statistically very small number of welfare recipients who do use drugs, smoking cannabis is fiscally responsible fun ... and I thought he\u2019d admire its Protestant thrift.</p> <p>Consistency of virtue, of course, is not a defining characteristic of Morrison, who prays to baby Jesus in a manger as he personally dispatches helpless kids to Christmas Island, just as it isn\u2019t of the \u201cfree speech\u201d crowd around him who painted Israel Folau as a martyr while they remain silent on the union delegate ratted out then fired for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/05/oil-refinery-worker-fired-over-downfall-parody-video-loses-unfair-dismissal-claim\">sharing a Downfall meme</a> in a group chat.</p> <p>It\u2019s those people who will spruik this stupid policy without imagining, for even one second, what life is like on $489.70 a fortnight (or around $35 per day), who are the danger here.

      "bodyText": "The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison is, at the very least, a man one could never accuse of a fresh idea. This week, he\u2019s wandered out to the ol\u2019 conservative graveyard with his policy shovel again, trying to resurrect the somewhat wormy corpse of a plan to drug test welfare recipients. No one should be surprised that the Liberals are desperate for a bit of Grand Guignol theatrics to distract the masses. After scraping back into government on the insistent myth of their superior economic management, the Liberals share in our national misfortune of being forced to live with its results. It was this week we learned that six years of the Liberals have just delivered Australia its worst financial year since the recession of 1990-91. And that on top of \u201cmiserable\u201d productivity growth and rising unemployment, the culmination of the ongoing policy disaster in the Murray-Darling is that crops are failing and farmers are warning the price of our food will go up. Of course the government have dug out the props and costumes to stage a culture war. One wonders if the unemployed were picked as villains because the Sri Lankan family from Biloela reminded everyone too much of their favourite neighbours for a \u201cbe scared of refugees\u201d theme to work. Not to mention there\u2019s no dramatic irony quite as powerful as punishing your victims for the proof they provide of your cruelty. But what is surprising \u2013 for some \u2013 is the Liberals choosing to revive this particular ghastly play. It was the Abbott iteration of this same government that mooted drug tests for welfare recipients in 2014. Condemned by medical experts, addiction specialists and the evidence of the policy\u2019s disastrous failure in both Florida and New Zealand, Australians were treated to the sight of Kevin Andrews being informed that Abbott had dropped the policy during the very ABC live interview into which he\u2019d been sent to defend it. My message to those shocked by the event is that they really should know by now that this is a government that never met a mistake they couldn\u2019t make twice. This being said, I\u2019ll admit that Morrison\u2019s pursuit of drug-testing surprised me. Not because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a calcified, uncaring relic who mouths crudely cribbed biblical conservatism in lieu of both policy depth and a human conscience, delivering a prime ministerial performance that to date amounts to little more than impersonating John Howard at an interminable political improv night \u2013 because I do, he is, he does and it probably always will. It\u2019s that \u2013 as the New Zealand experiment revealed \u2013 for the statistically very small number of welfare recipients who do use drugs, smoking cannabis is fiscally responsible fun ... and I thought he\u2019d admire its Protestant thrift. Consistency of virtue, of course, is not a defining characteristic of Morrison, who prays to baby Jesus in a manger as he personally dispatches helpless kids to Christmas Island, just as it isn\u2019t of the \u201cfree speech\u201d crowd around him who painted Israel Folau as a martyr while they remain silent on the union delegate ratted out then fired for sharing a Downfall meme in a group chat. It\u2019s those people who will spruik this stupid policy without imagining, for even one second, what life is like on $489.70 a fortnight (or around $35 per day), who are the danger here. Leaving aside that Morrison and his comrades get more than twice as much a day just as a meal allowance when they visit Canberra, the precise distance of certain Liberal party cheerleaders from the lived economy of Australians on welfare can be measured in the insistence of the \u201cnew\u201d bill\u2019s advocates that cocaine be added to the testing remit. Politely, I suggest that anyone who believes one can sustain a coke habit in Australia on an income of less than $300 a week is so far removed from a knowledge of how maths works that they should never be let near a costings paper again. Either that, or they\u2019re subject to a wilful optimism so powerful it could only be chemical. Perhaps when one is broke on Newstart, failing to get a job and trapped in one\u2019s home on an income that doesn\u2019t afford luxuries as indulgently costly as going to a movie, dinner with friends or drinks, bargain pleasures \u2013 like small amounts of a drug that\u2019s relatively cheap to buy, easy to grow and lasts for a few hours \u2013 might just be a cost-effective alternative entertainment.

Otherwise, participating in this nonsense is sound and fury on a stage, a convenient prop to a government that doesn\u2019t want anyone to follow the plot too closely. \u2022 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist",

He rose with quiet determination and ruthlessness.</p> \n<p>Raised a Catholic and educated at missionary schools, he moved to Fort Hare University in South Africa for the first of his seven degrees and became a teacher in Ghana.</p> \n<p>When he returned to the then Rhodesia in 1960, his political activism earned him a 10-year prison term for \u201csubversive speech\u201d, after which he fled to neighbouring Mozambique to lead the guerrilla forces of the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu) \u2013 which had split from Joshua Nkomo\u2019s Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (Zapu) \u2013 in a protracted war against Ian Smith\u2019s government that left 27,000 dead.</p> \n<p>The 1979 Lancaster House agreement in London brought independence to Zimbabwe and Mugabe returned home a hero.</p> \n<p>He announced a policy of reconciliation and invited whites to help rebuild the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf yesterday I fought you as an enemy, today you have become a friend,\u201d he told them. \u201cIf yesterday you hated me, today you cannot avoid the love that binds me to you.\u201d</p> \n<p>He initially ran a coalition government with Nkomo, his fellow freedom fighter, but the pair fell out.</p> \n<p>Then came the biggest counter-argument to the notion that Mugabe was a good man slowly corrupted by power: <em>Gukurahundi</em>, or \u201cthe rain that washes away the chaff before the spring rains\u201d.</p> \n<p>As early as 1982 his North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade crushed an armed rebellion by fighters loyal to Nkomo in the province of Matabeleland. His rival\u2019s party, Zapu, was ethnically largely Ndebele, while Zanu was predominantly Shona. This divide underlay the vicious ethnic cleansing that ensued in the mid-80s, when at least 20,000 people died in Matabeleland, a series of massacres classified as genocide by the US-based Genocide Watch.</p> \n<p>Few in the west noticed, or wanted to.

Trade unions and political activists began organising what would become the first viable political threat to Mugabe, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). But it was partly bankrolled by white farmers, which allowed Mugabe to whip up militancy against it.</p> \n<p>In 2000 Mugabe began a land reform programme, billed as an attempt to correct the unresolved colonialist legacy by giving white-owned farms to landless black people. Many saw it as a crude attempt to sideline the MDC, which commanded wide support among farm workers.</p> \n<p>White farmers were forcibly evicted by self-styled war veterans, many too young ever to have fought in the liberation war, and their properties handed to Zanu-PF cronies or black Zimbabweans who lacked the skills and capital to farm.</p> \n<p>The ensuing chaos undermined the economy, which shrank to half the size it had been in 1980. The one-time \u201cbreadbasket of Africa\u201d became dependent on foreign aid to feed its masses. Hyperinflation turned the national currency into a standing joke \u2013 a hamburger cost 15m Zimbabwe dollars \u2013 and it had to be abolished as the US dollar became the de facto currency.</p> \n<p>Schools and hospitals fell apart, once-eradicated diseases returned and life expectancy crashed from 61 to 45. Millions of people moved to neighbouring South Africa and other countries, a monumental flight of intellectual capital.</p> \n<p>The political environment also became hostile, with activists and journalists persecuted, jailed or murdered. The MDC claims that 253 people died in political violence in the 2008 election. The party\u2019s leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, widely seen as the vote\u2019s real winner, was forced to join Mugabe in an uneasy power-sharing agreement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96dc64f26367d6202a80b5e7101df5d0a3b04fd7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96dc64f26367d6202a80b5e7101df5d0a3b04fd7/0_34_1703_1023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, and president, Robert Mugabe, at a rally to mark Zimbabwe\u2019s 31st anniversary of independence in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, and president, Robert Mugabe, at a rally to mark Zimbabwe\u2019s 31st anniversary of independence in 2011.

Then he became reactionary. He reacted to the people\u2019s will by enforcing his will on the people. That was around the late 90s.\u201d</p> \n<p>Quite when, and why, Mugabe \u201cmoved from a hero to a villain\u201d will be debated for many years to come. Denis Norman, a white farmer who became his agriculture minister from 1980 to 1985, said: \u201cHe was such a complex character who was very difficult to fully understand and analyse. He was a very intelligent man who ruthlessly pursued his goals and ambitions, which during his rise to power must have injured many who were also competing for top positions.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have always maintained that his driving force was the desire to control and remain in power, and once achieved to remain in that position. I am well aware of the allegations of corruption that have surrounded him, but without any evidence as opposed to rumours, I don\u2019t believe that the creation of wealth was ever his motive; the same cannot be said for many of those who surround him.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe softer side of his nature was rarely if ever seen, but it certainly used to exist, along with a warm sense of humour, but I believe he guarded both very carefully in case they are interpreted as a sign of weakness.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d80a6e04-b34b-4a91-a01f-0a0d74a1edcd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tDGZV8WAnCo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Norman added: \u201cI don\u2019t think history will judge him favourably.

      "bodyText": "Three great questions dominated the 37-year rule of Robert Gabriel Mugabe, who has died aged 95. One is the mystery of how a giant of Africa\u2019s liberation movement, an intellectual who preached racial reconciliation long before Nelson Mandela emerged from prison, could turn into a caricature of despotism. Another is what kind of future he would bequeath Zimbabwe, a beautiful yet benighted country that he ruled for almost all of the nearly four decades that have passed since it won independence from the British. The third was the nature of his passing: would he die or be deposed? We got the answer to the last one in November 2017, when Mugabe was ousted in a military coup in everything but name then ruthlessly sacked by his own party. Reluctantly, bewildered and shaken, the ailing president stood down. His last weeks in power had been dominated by a power struggle between his wife, Grace, and the former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe\u2019s 1970s liberation wars who had always been viewed as a likely successor. The news of Mugabe\u2019s departure was greeted with rejoicing across the nation. For the other two questions there are clues, but no easy answers, to the making of this dictator. He was abandoned by his father as a boy; he suffered the deaths of a three-year-old son and a compassionate wife; then there was his warped fascination with Britain. Mugabe was awarded an honorary knighthood by the Queen then stripped of the honour, an insult he never forgave. The former colonial power shaped his dress code, manners and vision to the end. \u201cCricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe,\u201d he once said. \u201cI want ours to be a nation of gentlemen.\u201d Zimbabwe is a nation whose gentleness and articulacy seem at odds with the catalogue of torture and thuggery; a fertile land with the best climate in the world brought to the edge of ruin. Mugabe created Zanu-PF, the ruling party, in his own image, and sought to do the same with Zimbabwe. He rose with quiet determination and ruthlessness. Raised a Catholic and educated at missionary schools, he moved to Fort Hare University in South Africa for the first of his seven degrees and became a teacher in Ghana. When he returned to the then Rhodesia in 1960, his political activism earned him a 10-year prison term for \u201csubversive speech\u201d, after which he fled to neighbouring Mozambique to lead the guerrilla forces of the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu) \u2013 which had split from Joshua Nkomo\u2019s Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (Zapu) \u2013 in a protracted war against Ian Smith\u2019s government that left 27,000 dead. The 1979 Lancaster House agreement in London brought independence to Zimbabwe and Mugabe returned home a hero. He announced a policy of reconciliation and invited whites to help rebuild the country. \u201cIf yesterday I fought you as an enemy, today you have become a friend,\u201d he told them. \u201cIf yesterday you hated me, today you cannot avoid the love that binds me to you.\u201d He initially ran a coalition government with Nkomo, his fellow freedom fighter, but the pair fell out. Then came the biggest counter-argument to the notion that Mugabe was a good man slowly corrupted by power: Gukurahundi, or \u201cthe rain that washes away the chaff before the spring rains\u201d. As early as 1982 his North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade crushed an armed rebellion by fighters loyal to Nkomo in the province of Matabeleland. His rival\u2019s party, Zapu, was ethnically largely Ndebele, while Zanu was predominantly Shona. This divide underlay the vicious ethnic cleansing that ensued in the mid-80s, when at least 20,000 people died in Matabeleland, a series of massacres classified as genocide by the US-based Genocide Watch. Few in the west noticed, or wanted to. They preferred to see an economy that was growing as agriculture boomed and Mugabe built clinics and schools, turning Zimbabwe into one of the healthiest, best-educated and most hopeful countries in Africa. The optimism began to sour in 1997, when Mugabe gave in to pressure from war veterans waging violent protests for pensions. Trade unions and political activists began organising what would become the first viable political threat to Mugabe, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). But it was partly bankrolled by white farmers, which allowed Mugabe to whip up militancy against it. In 2000 Mugabe began a land reform programme, billed as an attempt to correct the unresolved colonialist legacy by giving white-owned farms to landless black people. Many saw it as a crude attempt to sideline the MDC, which commanded wide support among farm workers. White farmers were forcibly evicted by self-styled war veterans, many too young ever to have fought in the liberation war, and their properties handed to Zanu-PF cronies or black Zimbabweans who lacked the skills and capital to farm. The ensuing chaos undermined the economy, which shrank to half the size it had been in 1980. The one-time \u201cbreadbasket of Africa\u201d became dependent on foreign aid to feed its masses. Hyperinflation turned the national currency into a standing joke \u2013 a hamburger cost 15m Zimbabwe dollars \u2013 and it had to be abolished as the US dollar became the de facto currency. Schools and hospitals fell apart, once-eradicated diseases returned and life expectancy crashed from 61 to 45. Millions of people moved to neighbouring South Africa and other countries, a monumental flight of intellectual capital. The political environment also became hostile, with activists and journalists persecuted, jailed or murdered. The MDC claims that 253 people died in political violence in the 2008 election. The party\u2019s leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, widely seen as the vote\u2019s real winner, was forced to join Mugabe in an uneasy power-sharing agreement. \u201cHe started very well but ended up disgraced because he eroded his own legacy by collapsing a once-vibrant economy, by violence, by appearing to tendencies of dictatorship and one-man rule,\u201d Tsvangirai told the Guardian in a 2011 interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what his record will reveal.\u201d Mugabe could not bear to relinquish power even when the democratic current turned against him two decades ago, he added. \u201cI think the turning point of Mugabe was when he lost the support of the people, when it dawned on him the people no longer supported him. Then he became reactionary. He reacted to the people\u2019s will by enforcing his will on the people. That was around the late 90s.\u201d Quite when, and why, Mugabe \u201cmoved from a hero to a villain\u201d will be debated for many years to come. Denis Norman, a white farmer who became his agriculture minister from 1980 to 1985, said: \u201cHe was such a complex character who was very difficult to fully understand and analyse. He was a very intelligent man who ruthlessly pursued his goals and ambitions, which during his rise to power must have injured many who were also competing for top positions. \u201cI have always maintained that his driving force was the desire to control and remain in power, and once achieved to remain in that position. I am well aware of the allegations of corruption that have surrounded him, but without any evidence as opposed to rumours, I don\u2019t believe that the creation of wealth was ever his motive; the same cannot be said for many of those who surround him. \u201cThe softer side of his nature was rarely if ever seen, but it certainly used to exist, along with a warm sense of humour, but I believe he guarded both very carefully in case they are interpreted as a sign of weakness.\u201d Norman added: \u201cI don\u2019t think history will judge him favourably. He will be remembered for all the events that have taken place during his latter period in power: the land invasions, the rigged elections, the beatings in the townships and the ineptitude of the courts.\u201d Another insight is offered by Simba Makoni, who toured Europe with Mugabe in the late 1970s and served in his government. \u201cI know of two Mugabes: the early Mugabe and the later Mugabe. \u201cThe first Mugabe of the liberation struggle and the first 10, 15 years of independence isn\u2019t the Mugabe we have today. I didn\u2019t know him to be cruel, I didn\u2019t know him to be uncaring in the time that I worked closely with him in the early years.\u201d He said the status Mugabe \u201cdeserves of a national hero on the basis of his role in the liberation of the country\u201d was \u201ctotally wiped out\u201d by his conduct after. Makoni, a former finance minister, identifies three factors which led to the change in the leader\u2019s character: the accord with Nkomo that in effect destroyed any meaningful opposition \u2013 \u201cit removed the only alternative to Mugabe so he had no reason to look over his shoulder\u201d; his switch from prime minister to president in 1987; and the death of his Ghanaian-born first wife Sally in 1992. All of these happened after the Gukurahundi massacres. Makoni conceded: \u201cI accept yes, you won\u2019t find a rational explanation why a caring, compassionate leader would allow 20,000-30,000 of his citizens to be annihilated under the auspices of Gukurahundi. That notwithstanding, I would say the greater part of Mugabe would come through as a caring, compassionate, committed leader who wanted the best for his people \u2013 with the deviation or the aberration of Gukurahundi.\u201d Many of those who knew him describe an inner conflict between Mugabe the African nationalist and Mugabe the child of British colonialism. Heidi Holland, who interviewed him for her book Dinner with Mugabe, described him as having tears in his eyes when discussing the royal family. Tendai Biti, another former finance minister, called him \u201ca British gentleman in a proper Victorian sense\u201d. Makoni, who quit Zanu-PF to lead his own party, Mavambo Kusile Dawn, after a failed attempt to defeat Mugabe, said: \u201cI would say Britain is a passion, not an obsession. He loves the place and its character, its mannerisms. \u201cI remember once his crew did the longest single flight because Mugabe left New York to go to Wellington in New Zealand and he came via London.

My sense is all the anger about the illegal sanctions and all that \u2026 the fact that he hasn\u2019t been able to go to London, I think it irked him a lot.\u201d There is one man who will forever cast a shadow across Mugabe. Nelson Mandela\u2019s life and career paralleled Mugabe\u2019s in many ways until the South African president relinquished power after one five-year term. Mandela is revered as the greatest statesman Africa has produced; Mugabe, who clung on to power beyond his time, is seen as its fallen angel. Allister Sparks, the late South African journalist, recalled a conversation with Mandela: \u201cWe got to talking about Mugabe, whom he really profoundly disliked, and I think it was reciprocated.

English will also release footage only after people who are in it have been cross-examined. Day\u2019s family said: \u201cThis CCTV footage shows the last few hours that our mum was conscious. It shows her being denied her basic humanity and dignity. \u201cImagine having to watch your mum die in this way, with nobody held responsible. We want the world to see this footage because it is what our mum would have wanted. \u201cWhen you watch this harrowing footage, know that it is of a strong, proud and loving Yorta Yorta mother, grandmother, aunty and activist.\u201d The inquest continues.",

It is a documentary study of the French portrait photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/jul/02/brigitte-lacombes-photography-celebrity\" title=\"\">Brigitte Lacombe</a>, commissioned as part of Miu Miu\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.miumiu.com/en/women_tales/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Tales</a> series. Ramsay\u2019s approach is typically curious and mercurial, crossing the line in both directions as the film shows her shooting Lacombe while Lacombe shoots her. Both women normally hate having their picture taken. Both have always loved making images of others.</p> <p>\u201cI asked her how many pictures she takes a day and she wouldn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Ramsay says. \u201cIt was so many that it was like she was embarrassed. It\u2019s like an addiction for her and I\u2019m a bit like that too. I get really into things, totally obsessed. They thought I was deaf when I was a kid because I was always totally off in my own little world.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, she adds, she has known Lacombe for years. They first met in 2011, when Ramsay was in Cannes with her elegant adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/we-need-to-talk-about-kevin-review\" title=\"\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a>. They were hanging out together in Poland when Ramsay received word that Joaquin Phoenix had signed on to take the lead role of wonky, dangerous Joe in 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/26/you-were-never-really-here-review-joaquin-phoenix-lynne-ramsay-cannes-2017\" title=\"\">You Were Never Really Here</a>, which meant that the project was finally up and running. I tell her that Phoenix\u2019s latest turn in Joker seems to carry trace elements of his collaboration with Ramsay and she nods and smiles to humour me. \u201cJoe\u2019s scarier,\u201d she says finally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"93613ff49c1d06fe0290f85d95a294e45252a805\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93613ff49c1d06fe0290f85d95a294e45252a805/1235_408_3128_3128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joaquin Phoenix in Ramsay\u2019s 2017 film You Were Never Really Here\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joaquin Phoenix in Ramsay\u2019s 2017 film You Were Never Really Here.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StudioCanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Ramsay got the call to make the Lacombe documentary she was holed up in Costa Rica. She was hard at work on a script, starved of human company. \u201cWriting\u2019s so hard,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone once said that it\u2019s basically like vomiting and then bending down to pick out the good bits. And I always want to keep my hand in shooting stuff. Being on set, shooting a film \u2013 that\u2019s the part of the process I love the most.\u201d</p> <p>Which begs the obvious question: why isn\u2019t she doing more of it? Ramsay has made four features in two decades, each in their way a masterpiece. But right before meeting her, I run into Steven Soderbergh. And over that same period he has cranked out 23.</p> <p>\u201cWhy am I not making more?\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s all a money thing. Getting finance together can take a while. Getting everything right can take a lot of time.\u201d She grins. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m not a brilliant multitasker.\u201d</p> <p>For years she nursed a desire to make a big metaphysical science-fiction movie, with a plot freely adapted from Moby-Dick. This strikes me as the perfect text for a director whose career has been a saga of prolonged deep dives and sudden, splashy reappearances. She still thinks she would like to do it, but probably not for the foreseeable future. She has yet to catch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/29/ad-astra-review-brad-pitt-reaches-the-stars-in-superb-space-opera-with-serious-daddy-issues\" title=\"\">Ad Astra</a>, James Gray\u2019s acclaimed space saga, starring Brad Pitt as an astronaut on an obsessive search for his father. But she suspects that it might have slightly stolen her thunder.</p> <p>\u201cEvery director has a labour-of-love project,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like Stanley Kubrick always wanting to do Napoleon. So maybe I\u2019ll make it when I\u2019m 80 or something. But Ad Astra does feel a wee bit close to home. So yeah, James Gray probably got there first.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e12b6a60c3975fb90baa3453cc27225c53d5dd74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e12b6a60c3975fb90baa3453cc27225c53d5dd74/0_70_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kathleen McDermott and Samantha Morton in 2002\u2019s Morvern Callar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kathleen McDermott and Samantha Morton in 2002\u2019s Morvern Callar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naturally, there are other factors at play here as well. Ramsay was scarred by her fractious experience during the US production of Jane Got a Gun, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/25/jane-got-a-gun-lynne-ramsay\" title=\"\">eventually jumping ship</a> at the 11th hour in early 2013. Her marriage broke down; she went to live in Greece for four years. And she gave birth to a daughter, who is now about to start school. \u201cThat was probably the main thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to spend some time with my daughter.\u201d</p> <p>But she is aware that life is short; she says she probably needs to get cracking. Over in Costa Rica, she had been working on an original idea. The script is now done; the financial situation looks hopeful. \u201cSo I hope to get up and running with another feature next year,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe even sooner. Because I would like to make more, I really would. And I\u2019ve actually got four or five ideas on the go, enough projects to last me the next 10 years.\u201d Her eyes have taken on a faraway cast. She says: \u201cMaybe this is going to be the most prolific time of my life.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW2yPrKFw1E\" title=\"\">Brigitte</a> is available online now</em></p>",

She was hard at work on a script, starved of human company. \u201cWriting\u2019s so hard,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone once said that it\u2019s basically like vomiting and then bending down to pick out the good bits. And I always want to keep my hand in shooting stuff. Being on set, shooting a film \u2013 that\u2019s the part of the process I love the most.\u201d Which begs the obvious question: why isn\u2019t she doing more of it? Ramsay has made four features in two decades, each in their way a masterpiece. But right before meeting her, I run into Steven Soderbergh. And over that same period he has cranked out 23. \u201cWhy am I not making more?\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s all a money thing. Getting finance together can take a while. Getting everything right can take a lot of time.\u201d She grins. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m not a brilliant multitasker.\u201d For years she nursed a desire to make a big metaphysical science-fiction movie, with a plot freely adapted from Moby-Dick. This strikes me as the perfect text for a director whose career has been a saga of prolonged deep dives and sudden, splashy reappearances. She still thinks she would like to do it, but probably not for the foreseeable future. She has yet to catch Ad Astra, James Gray\u2019s acclaimed space saga, starring Brad Pitt as an astronaut on an obsessive search for his father. But she suspects that it might have slightly stolen her thunder. \u201cEvery director has a labour-of-love project,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like Stanley Kubrick always wanting to do Napoleon. So maybe I\u2019ll make it when I\u2019m 80 or something. But Ad Astra does feel a wee bit close to home. So yeah, James Gray probably got there first.\u201d Naturally, there are other factors at play here as well. Ramsay was scarred by her fractious experience during the US production of Jane Got a Gun, eventually jumping ship at the 11th hour in early 2013. Her marriage broke down; she went to live in Greece for four years. And she gave birth to a daughter, who is now about to start school. \u201cThat was probably the main thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to spend some time with my daughter.\u201d But she is aware that life is short; she says she probably needs to get cracking. Over in Costa Rica, she had been working on an original idea. The script is now done; the financial situation looks hopeful. \u201cSo I hope to get up and running with another feature next year,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe even sooner. Because I would like to make more, I really would. And I\u2019ve actually got four or five ideas on the go, enough projects to last me the next 10 years.\u201d Her eyes have taken on a faraway cast. She says: \u201cMaybe this is going to be the most prolific time of my life.\u201d \u2022 Brigitte is available online now",

These are familiar habits to a lot of people, including people who think of themselves as good and socially conscientious, people who read the New York Times, or vote Democratic, or have a stack of New Yorkers in their living rooms. As they partake in the backlash, deriding women who come forward for doing so, doubting that these women were really unwilling, and heaping sympathy upon men who have been accused, they will think that they are being just, being nuanced, being sensitive of the vagaries and doubts that emerge when trying to do what\u2019s right \u2013 even as they give all the benefits of all their doubts to men, and not to women.</p> <p>This emerging backlash will present a challenge to the feminist movement that has emerged in the #MeToo era, but it is not a new challenge, or a surprising one: anti-feminist reaction follows every feminist movement with the certainty and regularity of the tides. \u201cThe anti-feminist backlash has been set off not by women\u2019s achievement of full equality but by the increased possibility that they might win it,\u201d Faludi said. \u201cIt is a pre-emptive strike that stops women long before they reach the finish line.\u201d But the #MeToo movement has radicalized a generation of women, making them keenly aware that they do not have to silently suffer from sexual violence, or meekly accept the indignities of sexual harassment.

      "bodyText": "The climate change sceptic scientist Peter Ridd has been awarded $1.2m in compensation after winning an unfair dismissal case against his former employer, James Cook University. In April federal circuit court judge Salvatore Vasta found the actions of the university, including Ridd\u2019s repeated censure and ultimate dismissal, were unlawful. Vasta handed down a penalty on Friday and ordered the university to pay Ridd more than $1.2m for lost income, lost future income and pecuniary penalties. Guardian Australia understands the university intends to appeal the judgment. It has three weeks to lodge any appeal. The case has been repeatedly framed in media reports as one about academic freedom, or about the validity of the minority and controversial views held by Ridd about climate change and the health of the Great Barrier Reef. Vasta made clear in his judgment in April those matters were not on trial. \u201cSome have thought that this trial was about freedom of speech and intellectual freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cMedia reports have considered that this trial was about silencing persons with controversial or unpopular views. \u201cRather, this trial was purely and simply about the proper construction of a clause in an enterprise agreement.\u201d Vasta\u2019s ruling on Friday determined the extent of the economic loss suffered by Ridd as a result of his censure and dismissal. The scientist, who has endeared himself to some in the Queensland agricultural sector for arguing against the consensus view that farm pollution is damaging the reef, argued in court that academic institutions would not hire him. During the hearing, it was put to Ridd that he had received widespread promotion as a result of the case, and that this had in effect helped to maintain his reputation. \u201cNo, quite the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of the companies that want to hire scientists, all the fame and being on the Australian [newspaper] or on the IPA doesn\u2019t help one iota. I think it\u2019s bad. I mean, maybe that will produce a different career outcome but in terms of these sort of things most big institutions don\u2019t want a bar of somebody who has been through my sort of controversy.\u201d Vasta agreed that Ridd was \u201cdamaged goods\u201d and had poisoned the well for Ridd\u2019s future employment prospects. \u201cThe fact that JCU has not removed either of their press statements (despite my judgment) is almost tantamount to an attempt to ensure that Professor Ridd does not obtain employment in this field,\u201d he said. Despite the judge\u2019s earlier comments that it was not, Ridd said in a statement that the case \u201cwas always about academic freedom\u201d. \u201cIf JCU appeals it casts doubt that academic freedom is part of their DNA as they often insist,\u201d Ridd said. \u201cAn appeal will continue the huge and pointless legal costs.\u201d Ridd has recently held a series of lectures in regional Queensland, promoted by cane growers\u2019 groups and the climate-sceptic Australian Environment Foundation.",

      "bodyText": "Barcelona has begun installing its first shipping container homes just a stone\u2019s throw from La Rambla, the famous thoroughfare in the city centre, in a bid to provide emergency housing for people who have been evicted or otherwise driven out of the neighbourhood by gentrification. Work commenced last week on the 12 small apartments, which are being installed on Carrer Nou de Sant Francesc, a narrow street in the densely populated Ciutat Vella (\u201cold city\u201d) district. The container scheme, which has raised eyebrows in a city known for its elegant urban landscape, was initially rejected by the council for fear tenants would feel stigmatised. With over 1,000 people on the emergency housing list, however, it was soon revived. The organisation behind the project is Aprop \u2013 an acronym meaning \u201clocal provisional housing\u201d that also means \u201cclose by\u201d in Catalan \u2013 which is working in conjunction with three architectural practices. David Ju\u00e1rez, an architect at Straddle3, one of the practices involved, says people have an image of a \u201cnaff\u201d project but that there is nothing shabby about the one- and two-bedroom flats being constructed. They will be built to the same standards as conventional housing, with good thermal and sound insulation and under-floor heating, he says, and when the work is complete they will not even be recognisable as containers. \u201cThese container homes are built to a higher standard than much of what is on the rental market in Barcelona,\u201d says the housing activist Jaime Palomera, spokesman for the city\u2019s Tenants\u2019 Union. \u201cThis idea that the poor are being forced to live in sardine tins is nonsense.\u201d But concerns have been raised about this type of housing. \u201cThe biggest problem with containers is insulation, both thermal and noise,\u201d says Co Govers of the Zest Architecture practice in Barcelona, which specialises in low-energy construction. \u201cThat was the big issue when they built student residences in the Netherlands with containers, that they were cold and noisy.

Ju\u00e1rez says Aprop\u2019s prime motivation is to resist the tide of gentrification that is driving all but the most well-to-do out of the city centre as speculation and tourist apartments force up rents and house prices. \u201cNearly all social housing is built on the outskirts and not in the city centre,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is because most of the work on public housing is done by a few big construction companies and they are only interested in big projects. \u201cWe can produce housing in much smaller empty spaces that exist all over the city.

In May, Gallup <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/257639/four-americans-embrace-form-socialism.aspx\">found</a> that 43% thought some form of socialism would be good for the country, putting socialism at a statistical tie with Trump, who\u2019s approval ratings were 42%. The term was particularly popular among the non-white and the young. A Harris <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/398580-poll-majority-of-americans-say-the-would-not-vote-for-a\">poll</a> released a couple of weeks earlier found that only 24% said they would vote for a socialist.

A Harris poll from March<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-poll-young-americans-embracing-socialism-b051907a-87a8-4f61-9e6e-0db75f7edc4a.html\">suggests</a> half of those under the age of 40 would \u201cprefer to live in a socialist country\u201d.

Her father <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/us/politics/11wife.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=983A43FEB4D42406936061119EBE71BC&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL\">Dick Mell</a>, the father-in-law of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/dec/07/rod-blagojevich-illinois-corrupt\">former</a> Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich (currently in jail for corruption and extortion), had held the seat since 1975. When Dick retired in 2013, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel appointed his daughter as his successor. She <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2019/4/29/18620033/mell-family-dynasty-ends-after-44-years-deb-mell-concedes-to-socialist\">lost </a>the seat to a socialist candidate, Rosana Rodriguez-Sanchez. <a href=\"https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/04/02/andre-vasquez-is-the-projected-winner-in-the-runoff-for-40th-ward-alderman/\">Another</a> socialist,<strong> </strong>Andre Vasquez, beat Patrick O\u2019Connor, who <a href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/April-2019/Whos-Glad-That-Race-in-the-40th-Ward-Is-Over-Patrick-OConnor-Andre-Vasquez/\">has been</a> on the city council for 36 years and was part of the overwhelmingly white council group that fought hard to block the agenda of the Chicago\u2019s first African American mayor, Harold Washington. All three of the aldermen who preceded Jeanette Taylor, also backed by the Democratic Socialists of America, <a href=\"https://www.illinoispolicy.org/another-chicago-alderman-pleads-guilty-to-corruption-charges/\">were indicted</a> for fraud.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Americans are more likely to associate socialism with 'equality' than 'government ownership or control', as they did in the 40s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is potentially, in these local spaces that the shift to the left and the shift to the grassroots might meet. At the first ward meeting for Rodriguez-Sanchez, more than 60 people crowded into a small room, where their new representative said a few words before encouraging people to approach her or her staff with issues they would like raised. Rodriguez-Sanchez beat Deborah Mell by just 13 votes. Every last piece of organisation helped.</p> <p>The Democratic Socialists played a role, explains local activist<strong> </strong>Sandy Gutstein, but so did lots of groups, including immigrants\u2019 rights organizations and anti-racist campaigners. \u201cA lot of people were coming into the office who have not been involved in politics before,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people were attracted to the campaign because of that.\u201d</p> <p>Across town, that same night, Jeanette Taylor had to choose a ward superintendent, a paid position to monitor whether local people are getting the services to which they are entitled. Usually they are appointed. Taylor held an election. \u201cI let the community decide,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that\u2019s going to get built in this community, it will be up for the community to decide whether it gets built or not. Three people applied. We heard a presentation from all three folks. They were asked to leave. We had some discussion and then they voted.\u201d</p> <p>According to Gallup, Americans are more likely to associate socialism with \u201cequality\u201d than \u201cgovernment ownership or control\u201d, as they did in the 40s. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about class antagonism,\u201d explains Jesse Sharkey, <a href=\"https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/November-2014/How-Jesse-Sharkey-Became-the-New-Head-of-the-CTU/\">the leader</a> of the Chicago Teachers\u2019 Union. \u201cIt\u2019s about humane capitalism \u2013 having social control over the harshest features of capitalism like healthcare and pensions.\u201d</p> <p>The point is it\u2019s a question that is now regularly put in polls and a label that is <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/07/socialism-progressives-liberalism\">popularly claimed</a>. It remains problematic for many.</p> <p>But it\u2019s no longer like saying cocksucker.</p> <p>Carlos Ramirez-Rosa <a href=\"https://people.chicagoreader.com/who/carlos-ramirez-rosa/profile/\">has been</a> an alderman in Chicago since 2015. When he ran four years ago he \u201cflirted with the idea of running as an open democratic socialist\u201d but decided against it. \u201cThere were a number of people in the community who wanted to see me run but said \u2018Carlos, don\u2019t run with this group of socialists\u2019. Because you\u2019re going to go out there and wave this red flag and these folks who are pushing you to do that are going to stay on the sidelines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29c721bd1704984dcbf3be889b4662ad1221a1a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29c721bd1704984dcbf3be889b4662ad1221a1a1/0_48_5125_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Bernie Sanders supporter attends a rally in Philadelphia in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Bernie Sanders supporter attends a rally in Philadelphia in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Reuter/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ramirez-Rosa credits the shift to Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist candidate who mounted a surprisingly effective challenge against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and is running again. \u201cSeeing him so openly talking about being a democratic socialist.

Flitting between Yiddish and English Kahn draws on pre-second world war leftwing Jewish traditions, adapting songs written by socialist Bundist leaders of yore.</p> <p>The event, organised by Chicago <a href=\"https://www.chicagoyivo.org/\">Yivo</a>, which aims to promote the cultural history of Jewish life in eastern Europe, Germany and Russia in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative to a Zionist identity,\u201d says Karen Underhill who organized the event. \u201cIt\u2019s not a total rejection of it but it tries to move beyond the two pillars of Jewish identity \u2013 Zionism and the Holocaust \u2013 by embracing left Jewish culture pre-world war two.\u201d</p> <p>Shtumer Alef, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMD4uvkN9TtWNNrFdrCyT4w\">yiddish punk </a>support band for Kahn, warmed the crowd up by getting them to sing along in Yiddish to: \u201cRemember to always punch Nazis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrump has politicised everything,\u201d says Lorrie, who sings in the band, as she pops out for a cigarette. \u201cPeople talk about politics all the time.

At the first ward meeting for Rodriguez-Sanchez, more than 60 people crowded into a small room, where their new representative said a few words before encouraging people to approach her or her staff with issues they would like raised. Rodriguez-Sanchez beat Deborah Mell by just 13 votes. Every last piece of organisation helped. The Democratic Socialists played a role, explains local activist Sandy Gutstein, but so did lots of groups, including immigrants\u2019 rights organizations and anti-racist campaigners. \u201cA lot of people were coming into the office who have not been involved in politics before,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people were attracted to the campaign because of that.\u201d Across town, that same night, Jeanette Taylor had to choose a ward superintendent, a paid position to monitor whether local people are getting the services to which they are entitled. Usually they are appointed. Taylor held an election. \u201cI let the community decide,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that\u2019s going to get built in this community, it will be up for the community to decide whether it gets built or not. Three people applied. We heard a presentation from all three folks. They were asked to leave. We had some discussion and then they voted.\u201d According to Gallup, Americans are more likely to associate socialism with \u201cequality\u201d than \u201cgovernment ownership or control\u201d, as they did in the 40s. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about class antagonism,\u201d explains Jesse Sharkey, the leader of the Chicago Teachers\u2019 Union. \u201cIt\u2019s about humane capitalism \u2013 having social control over the harshest features of capitalism like healthcare and pensions.\u201d The point is it\u2019s a question that is now regularly put in polls and a label that is popularly claimed. It remains problematic for many. But it\u2019s no longer like saying cocksucker. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa has been an alderman in Chicago since 2015. When he ran four years ago he \u201cflirted with the idea of running as an open democratic socialist\u201d but decided against it. \u201cThere were a number of people in the community who wanted to see me run but said \u2018Carlos, don\u2019t run with this group of socialists\u2019. Because you\u2019re going to go out there and wave this red flag and these folks who are pushing you to do that are going to stay on the sidelines.\u201d Ramirez-Rosa credits the shift to Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist candidate who mounted a surprisingly effective challenge against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and is running again. \u201cSeeing him so openly talking about being a democratic socialist. Not running away from the label; leaning in to it.\u201d Earlier this year he ran as a democratic socialist and won again. \u201cHaving been involved in the work I\u2019m not surprised at all that we have six socialists on city council. But when I take a step back and put myself in the place I was in 2015 I think, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s tremendous.\u2019\u201d Rick Perlstein, a Chicago-based author who has chronicled the rise of the American right since the civil rights era, believes some of socialism\u2019s appeal comes from Republicans using it as an epithet against Barack Obama in the midst of an economic crisis. \u201cI think a lot of people felt, well if that\u2019s what socialism is then how bad can it be?\u201d I met Perlstein at a packed Martyrs\u2019 nightclub in Chicago where the young dance while older folk clap and stomp as Daniel Kahn and the Painted Bird sing about gentrification, toxic masculinity and economic inequality. Flitting between Yiddish and English Kahn draws on pre-second world war leftwing Jewish traditions, adapting songs written by socialist Bundist leaders of yore. The event, organised by Chicago Yivo, which aims to promote the cultural history of Jewish life in eastern Europe, Germany and Russia in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative to a Zionist identity,\u201d says Karen Underhill who organized the event. \u201cIt\u2019s not a total rejection of it but it tries to move beyond the two pillars of Jewish identity \u2013 Zionism and the Holocaust \u2013 by embracing left Jewish culture pre-world war two.\u201d Shtumer Alef, the yiddish punk support band for Kahn, warmed the crowd up by getting them to sing along in Yiddish to: \u201cRemember to always punch Nazis.\u201d \u201cTrump has politicised everything,\u201d says Lorrie, who sings in the band, as she pops out for a cigarette. \u201cPeople talk about politics all the time. But the Democratic establishment keeps failing upwards. That\u2019s why they are so scared of someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . She\u2019s a powerful symbol of a different way of doing things.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2019 because an earlier version misnamed Karen Underhill as Kate Underhill. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>The Gears of War series has made me laugh many times over the years, but Gears 5 may be the first time it\u2019s done so on purpose. Developed by Microsoft subsidiary the Coalition, the latest sequel surrounds the familiar cover-shooting mechanics with upgrade systems, side-missions and even large open spaces to explore. But perhaps Gears 5\u2019s most significant addition is a sense of levity.</p> <p>Far from the grey, hyper-serious tone of the original trilogy, Gears 5 brings us a wide-ranging adventure that is often as gaudy as it is gory. The campaign\u2019s introductory chapter sees players exploring an abandoned missile silo hidden on a tropical island, a location choice that seems more befitting of Uncharted than Gears. The script, meanwhile, is laced with daft one-liners and pithy retorts, embracing the series\u2019 inherent absurdities rather than bulldozing through them.</p> <p>From the off, Gears 5 clearly wants players to have fun. The story centres around Kait, promoted from sidekick in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/06/gears-of-war-4-review-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-a-fading-series\">Gears 4</a> to the series\u2019 first female protagonist (Marcus Fenix assumes a supporting role for the second game in a row). After the Locust were resurrected in the previous title, Kait has begun seeing strange visions of the swarm, triggering a personal quest that sees Gears depart from many of its long-established conventions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b11393172de3e6294c9d264dffa3a42da1c9e8c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b11393172de3e6294c9d264dffa3a42da1c9e8c3/44_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Departs from convention \u2026 Gears 5.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Departs from convention \u2026 Gears 5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a first act that reintroduces the basics, Gears 5 suddenly ditches its typically linear levels, offering several vast environments for the player to explore. The first of these is a stunning arctic landscape where the ice crackles beneath Kait\u2019s feet and a towering supercell peppers the ground with razor-sharp hail. You traverse this glittering expanse using a sailing skiff, gliding nimbly across the ice and snow as you search for landmarks to investigate.</p> <p>Structurally, Gears 5 bears similarities to <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/metro-exodus-review/\">Metro Exodus</a>, using its open-ended maps to enhance the sense of adventure rather than offering true freedom. Each map has only a handful of side-activities, all of which revolve around combat.

      "bodyText": "The Gears of War series has made me laugh many times over the years, but Gears 5 may be the first time it\u2019s done so on purpose. Developed by Microsoft subsidiary the Coalition, the latest sequel surrounds the familiar cover-shooting mechanics with upgrade systems, side-missions and even large open spaces to explore. But perhaps Gears 5\u2019s most significant addition is a sense of levity. Far from the grey, hyper-serious tone of the original trilogy, Gears 5 brings us a wide-ranging adventure that is often as gaudy as it is gory. The campaign\u2019s introductory chapter sees players exploring an abandoned missile silo hidden on a tropical island, a location choice that seems more befitting of Uncharted than Gears. The script, meanwhile, is laced with daft one-liners and pithy retorts, embracing the series\u2019 inherent absurdities rather than bulldozing through them. From the off, Gears 5 clearly wants players to have fun. The story centres around Kait, promoted from sidekick in Gears 4 to the series\u2019 first female protagonist (Marcus Fenix assumes a supporting role for the second game in a row). After the Locust were resurrected in the previous title, Kait has begun seeing strange visions of the swarm, triggering a personal quest that sees Gears depart from many of its long-established conventions. After a first act that reintroduces the basics, Gears 5 suddenly ditches its typically linear levels, offering several vast environments for the player to explore. The first of these is a stunning arctic landscape where the ice crackles beneath Kait\u2019s feet and a towering supercell peppers the ground with razor-sharp hail. You traverse this glittering expanse using a sailing skiff, gliding nimbly across the ice and snow as you search for landmarks to investigate. Structurally, Gears 5 bears similarities to Metro Exodus, using its open-ended maps to enhance the sense of adventure rather than offering true freedom. Each map has only a handful of side-activities, all of which revolve around combat. Yet whether you\u2019re plundering an abandoned mine or helping a group of desert nomads get their water pumps running, scouring the fringes of Gears 5 is rarely less than entertaining. It helps that the combat still, quite literally, rips. Six games down the line, introducing a Locust to your chainsaw bayonet is yet to get old, and the game\u2019s familiar cover and sprint mechanics retain their satisfying sense of weight. Fans of the series will be pleased to hear there are more ways to make things bleed than ever, including a version of the iconic Lancer rifle that fires cluster-grenades, and the ludicrously powerful Breaker Mace, which lets Kait punt Locust halfway across the map like fleshy golf-balls. More importantly, Gears 5 also expands your tactical options, via an upgrade system that relates to your drone companion, Jack. Over the course of the game, you can equip Jack with a team-wide cloaking device that lets you sneak up on Locust for a silent kill, as well as an ability that lets him turn a Locust to your side. Initially these powers seem superfluous, but as the campaign\u2019s challenge begins to bite, deploying them wisely can make the difference between victory and defeat. The tactical side of Gears 5 is even more significant in cooperative mode. Up to three players can partake in a campaign, one of whom assumes the role of Jack. Jack uses his cloaking device instead of cover for protection, floating around unseen above the battlefield until he becomes involved in the action, either deploying his abilities or zapping enemies with an electrical charge.

      "bodyText": "Hours after Texas suffered its latest mass shooting, when a gunman drove through Odessa on Saturday shooting randomly from an assault-style rifle and killing seven people, the state\u2019s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, declared that he\u2019d had enough. \u201cI have been to too many of these events as governor,\u201d he said. \u201cI am tired of the dying in Texas. Too many Texans have lost their lives. The status quo in Texas is unacceptable and action is needed.\u201d His sense of urgency was all too understandable. Texas has been the scene of four of the 10 most deadly mass shootings in modern US history, including the Walmart massacre in El Paso last month in which a white supremacist murdered 22 people. Abbott\u2019s call to action was surprising given the unique position he holds within the US gun debate. Under his leadership, Texas Republicans have forged a template for the rightwing response to mass shootings that has been emulated across the country and found a willing accomplice in Donald Trump on the national stage. That template was fully on display on Sunday, the day after the Odessa shooting. As he was proclaiming that he\u2019d had enough, nine new laws were coming into force \u2013 all of them signed by Abbott, all of them loosening gun controls. The new laws allow more armed marshals to patrol Texas schools. They permit citizens without a license to carry handguns in the middle of disaster zones, and they give the green light to licensed weapons being stored inside cars in school parking lots. Another new rule clears the way for licensed handguns to be carried inside churches and other places of worship. The law comes into effect almost two years after the massacre at Sutherland Springs where 27 worshippers were gunned down as they prayed inside their Baptist church. Abbott\u2019s template for dealing with mass shootings hails directly from the National Rifle Association (NRA), the pro-gun lobby that wields outsized influence over Republican politicians by funding their campaigns and grading their performances (the NRA gives Abbott an A+). One of the NRA\u2019s key slogans is: \u201cThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d Where action is to be taken, it is focused entirely on intercepting and punishing shooters. Since the Odessa rampage Abbott has proposed fast-tracking executions of mass shooters. On Thursday he introduced eight executive orders designed to improve detection of suspicious activity by potential attackers. In all these moves, however, one thing has been conspicuously lacking \u2013 any attempt to tackle the root of the problem: easy access to powerful weapons that can kill large numbers within seconds. Critics of this approach argue that the idea that the answer to gun violence is to encourage more guns is perverse and a threat to public safety. \u201cUntil we see our leadership stand up to the NRA and implement basic solutions, we are going to have additional loss of life,\u201d said Victoria Neave, a Democrat who represents Dallas in the Texas house (she gets a D grade from the NRA).

The second season features <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HNya8Il2L8\">an Irish priest</a> (Andrew Scott) whose vow of celibacy is temporarily compromised by Fleabag. He, in turn, punctures Fleabag\u2019s cynical shell.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/nov/03/grantchesters-holy-sleuths-are-brimming-with-bromance-and-charm\">Grantchester</a>, the mystery series about the crime-solving, jazz-listening Anglican vicar <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/love-dilemma-for-vicar-sidney-chambers-as-grantchester-returns-35645997.html\">Sidney Chambers</a> (James Norton). Chambers rides a bicycle around the bucolic postwar English countryside, getting mixed up in intrigue while battling his own demons, including combat PTSD. Since Chambers isn\u2019t sworn to celibacy, he also gets into various romantic entanglements. In the most recent season, Chambers is replaced by a new vicar \u2013 Will Davenport (Tom Brittney). Davenport is also devastatingly handsome, though he rides a motorbike, not a bicycle, and listens to rock instead of jazz.</p> <p>Derry Girls, Netflix\u2019s quirky sitcom about a group of Catholic schoolgirls (and one schoolboy) in 1990s Northern Ireland, also has a hot priest \u2013 the hip young Father Peter, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_7PoX11FEc\">strides in</a> accompanied by Snap!\u2019s Do You See the Light.

(The network\u2019s Spanish-language comedy, Los Espookys, has a subplot in the first episode involving an older priest resentful of a handsome, glossy-lipped, younger priest.)</p> <p>As for movies, there are <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/hot-fictional-priests/?slide=6442633#6442633\">almost too many</a> hot priest-related ones to count, but the most recent that springs to mind is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCF5Y8dQpR4\">First Reformed</a>, Paul Schrader\u2019s 2017 drama featuring Ethan Hawke as a conflicted Calvinist clergyman.</p> <p>On a recent Sunday, I decided to undertake some field research at an Episcopal church. There were three clergy \u2013 a woman and two men \u2013 and during the eucharist I seized the opportunity to get a closer look. Red wine trickled down my chin.</p> <p>The priest who administered my communion was fairly good-looking. But was he a hot priest? I wondered, tripping as I entered my pew. And how do you define \u201chot\u201d? The scale itself is subjective, is it not?

      "bodyText": "\u201cAre we living in the cultural moment of the \u2018hot priest\u2019?\u201d my editor asked. I wanted an assignment, and for my sins she gave me one. \u201cThere\u2019s the one on Fleabag,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the \u2018hot priest summer\u2019 guy on TikTok. Find one more and it makes a trend.\u201d I must have looked dubious. \u201cSix hundred to 800 words,\u201d she said. \u201cFast.\u201d But when I thought about it, I began to notice hot priests everywhere. Certainly Fleabag, the cult television series created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, has done its part for hot priests. The second season features an Irish priest (Andrew Scott) whose vow of celibacy is temporarily compromised by Fleabag. He, in turn, punctures Fleabag\u2019s cynical shell. Then there\u2019s Grantchester, the mystery series about the crime-solving, jazz-listening Anglican vicar Sidney Chambers (James Norton). Chambers rides a bicycle around the bucolic postwar English countryside, getting mixed up in intrigue while battling his own demons, including combat PTSD. Since Chambers isn\u2019t sworn to celibacy, he also gets into various romantic entanglements. In the most recent season, Chambers is replaced by a new vicar \u2013 Will Davenport (Tom Brittney). Davenport is also devastatingly handsome, though he rides a motorbike, not a bicycle, and listens to rock instead of jazz. Derry Girls, Netflix\u2019s quirky sitcom about a group of Catholic schoolgirls (and one schoolboy) in 1990s Northern Ireland, also has a hot priest \u2013 the hip young Father Peter, who strides in accompanied by Snap!\u2019s Do You See the Light. (Sister Michael, the scene-stealing school principal, is less impressed. \u201cFor feck\u2019s sake,\u201d she mutters during one of his platitudes.) And yes, one more series: HBO has The Young Pope (Jude Law), returning soon in the sequel series, The New Pope. (The network\u2019s Spanish-language comedy, Los Espookys, has a subplot in the first episode involving an older priest resentful of a handsome, glossy-lipped, younger priest.) As for movies, there are almost too many hot priest-related ones to count, but the most recent that springs to mind is First Reformed, Paul Schrader\u2019s 2017 drama featuring Ethan Hawke as a conflicted Calvinist clergyman. On a recent Sunday, I decided to undertake some field research at an Episcopal church. There were three clergy \u2013 a woman and two men \u2013 and during the eucharist I seized the opportunity to get a closer look. Red wine trickled down my chin. The priest who administered my communion was fairly good-looking. But was he a hot priest? I wondered, tripping as I entered my pew. And how do you define \u201chot\u201d? The scale itself is subjective, is it not? Does a man (or woman) of the cloth need some other, more je ne sais quoi quality in order to qualify? Is it more about charisma? I tried to puzzle through the phenomenon of the hot priest. Clearly there was something deeper, and more Freudian, at work \u2013 something about the priest as ultimate unattainable love interest. Is it because we like to think we\u2019re so special someone might break their vows just to be with us? Is it about the sexual taboo of coveting a man of God? Or is it something more complicated, and maybe even benevolent \u2013 a sign that millennials aren\u2019t as resigned to godless materialism as commonly thought? David Peters, an Episcopal priest and former military chaplain who has written for the Guardian, thinks it is probably a mixture of all of the above. A self-described \u201cliturgical influencer\u201d and \u201cVsco girl for Jesus\u201d, Peters has achieved modest viral fame on the streaming app TikTok for his #hotpriestsummer videos. Peters is trying to \u201cchurchplant\u201d a new congregation in the Austin suburbs and seized on TikTok as an unorthodox way of spreading the Good News. In his videos he lip-syncs to pop songs while showing off his most outrageous ecclesiastical garb and swinging incense. \u201cI think religious people, especially religious leaders, are not known for their joy,\u201d Peters told Vice. \u201cBut we believe that someone died and rose from the dead \u2013 that should make us really happy.\u201d As for this sudden cultural infatuation with priests, he has a theory: \u201cIn any kind of romantic writing you\u2019ve got to create a situation where it\u2019s not easy for the couple to get together,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs our society becomes more progressive there are less and less of those barriers.

Two years later Chinese companies ramped up their investment in US manufacturing and reopened the shuttered factories. This politically intelligent documentary \u2013 the first distributed by the Obamas\u2019 film company \u2013 presents an unusual global twist in the story of post-industrial decline, and resists the simplistic positive narratives of many social-impact documentaries that have debuted at the Sundance film festival.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/25/netflix-killer-why-disney-plus-signals-the-start-of-australian-streamings-hunger-games\">Netflix killer? Why Disney Plus signals the start of Australian streaming's Hunger Games</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The Core</strong></h2> <p><strong>By </strong><strong>Jon Amiel (US, 2003) \u2013 out now</strong></p> <p>A glimpse into a culture of big, dumb, popular cinema that\u2019s entirely different from today\u2019s. The post-cold war period gave way to a raft of disaster blockbusters in which America\u2019s enemy wasn\u2019t geopolitical but of the Earth and the cosmos. Here a group of scientists (Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci) fight a geological Armageddon, journeying to the centre of the planet to jumpstart its molten core with a massive detonation device. Quasi science fiction at its satisfyingly silliest.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> The Edge of Democracy, Elena, Olmo and the Seagull, World War Z, Revolutionary Road (films, out now), War of the Worlds (film, 15 September), Between Two Ferns: The Movie (20 September), The Good Place (season 4, 27 September), Ingrid Goes West (film, 28 September).</p> <h2><em><strong>Stan</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Killing Eve</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Phoebe Waller-Bridge (UK, 2018) \u2013 5 September</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBjBavIC9U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-MBjBavIC9U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of the finest shows of last year, Killing Eve\u2019s first season inverted so many exhausted cliches of the crime genre: the cat-and-mouse chase, the obsessive relationship between cops and crims, the male-dominated intelligence agencies, the ice-cold sociopath. Two women \u2013 Eve (Sandra Oh), a bumbling yet intuitive MI5 agent, and Villanelle (Jodie Comer), a flamboyant and individualistic assassin \u2013 fall in love across chasms of law and logic. Seductive, stressful, surprising until the very last scene.</p> <h2><strong>Creed II</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Steven Caplan Jr (US, 2018) \u2013 6 September</strong></p> <p>Michael B Jordan returns as Adonis Creed, whose new boxing adversary, the steroidal Viktor Drago, is the son of the man who killed his father. Adonis\u2019s quest to obliterate Drago alienates both his trainer Rocky Balboa (creakily charismatic Sylvester Stallone, also on board as screenwriter) and his partner Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Though it doesn\u2019t scale the heights of the first Creed film, this sequel deftly touches on enough conventions of glorious sports-drama-epics \u2013 a once poverty-stricken star with a chip on his shoulder, a date with destiny that becomes obsessive, a tragic family backstory, the clash of two patrilineal sporting dynasties, a great training montage \u2013 to make a new outing in the Rocky franchise worthwhile.</p> <h2><strong>Che: Part One and Che: Part Two</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Steven Soderbergh (US, 2008) \u2013 26 September</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvpHlsXszdY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OvpHlsXszdY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Writer-director Steven Soderbergh brings his most gritty, inscrutable sensibility to the story of the Argentinian Marxist revolutionary, guerrilla leader and intellectual, Che Guevara. Rolling from 1955 into the early days of the Cuban revolution, Soderbergh has no interest in the usual dichotomised vision of Guevara as either a hero or a tyrant. Benicio Del Toro\u2019s Che is a doomed, dogged, complicated man, and the film \u2013 almost entirely in Spanish \u2013 sheds the populist restrictions of a conventional biopic for something more sprawling, difficult and interesting.</p> <h2><strong>Mean Girls</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Mark Waters (US, 2004) \u2013 18 September</strong></p> <p>New girl Cady (Lindsay Lohan) engages in a misplaced campaign to ascend her new school\u2019s hierarchy of cliques, betraying her friends (Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese) to unseat the meanest, coolest girl in school, Regina George (Rachel McAdams). Writer Tina Fey is the true auteurist voice of this classic teen film, which cleverly lances all the genre\u2019s touchstone themes: female competition, an impossible desire for popularity, the glorification of social outcasts, and revenge quests by said outcasts. Still fetch.</p> <h2><strong>Synecdoche, New York</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Charlie Kaufman (US, 2008) \u2013 29 September</strong></p> <p>Sony Pictures asked filmmaker Charlie Kaufman to conceptualise a horror film and he came up with the most existential idea possible. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Caden, a disillusioned hypochondriac playwright who abandons the stage to create a lifelong, unscripted work of theatre in a New York warehouse that plays out in real time. Kaufman\u2019s profoundly melancholic film surrenders realism to realise Caden\u2019s dream \u2013 to relinquish the pretence of staged writing and bridge the gap between art and life \u2013 which is as ambitious and beautiful as it is impossible. In Kaufman\u2019s vision, realised with a heartbreaking performance by Hoffman, is that the things that really scare us \u2013 the inevitability of illness, disappointment, mortality and loneliness \u2013 aren\u2019t otherworldly. They\u2019re real.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> The Immigrant (film, 14 September), True Grit (film, 17 September), Meet the Parents (film, 27 September), Forrest Gump (film, 29 September), Fatal Attraction (film, 30 September), Broad City (season 5, 30 September).</p> <h2><em><strong>Foxtel Now</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Succession (season two)</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Jesse Armstrong and Adam </strong><strong>McKay (US, 2019) \u2013 Mondays</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l9TKHvvaMfE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The meanest show on TV, Succession brings the US\u2019s problems \u2013 inequality, wealth obsession, dynastic war and patriarchal obsolescence \u2013 into singular focus through an uber-rich business family. Season one ended with Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) abdicating his ambitions to usurp his father Logan (a dead-eyed Brian Cox), an avatar for Rupert Murdoch who also began his media empire decades before digitisation. Season two sees Shiv (Australian Sarah Snook blooming in droll, non-homicidal sociopath mode) begin the ascendancy to take her father\u2019s place as chief executive and position the family at the top of the media game again. A dark, bleakly funny view of the transactional nature of family for the super-rich, written by Jesse Armstrong (Peep Show, The Thick of It).</p> <h2><strong>Bridge of Spies</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Steven Spielberg (US, 2015) \u2013 17 September</strong></p> <p>Steven Spielberg\u2019s late era sees him working far outside the blockbuster cycle of his early days \u2013 the pure genre works of Indiana Jones, Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which were all stories of childhood heroes, boyhood dreams and family cohesion. Spielberg now mythologises whistleblowers, journalists and maverick spies. After the dialogue-driven Lincoln, Bridge of Spies<em> </em>masks another excursion into US political history. In this action-inflected tale in the dead of the cold war, Tom Hanks plays an idealistic lawyer working to save his country \u2013 and a KGB agent (Mark Rylance) \u2013 from menace of the Soviets. Taut, thrilling, morally alert, and fascinating in how patriotic American liberals narrativise world history.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Catch Me If You Can (film, out now), Veronica Guerin (film, 8 September), Collateral (film, 30 September).</p> <h2><em><strong>SBS On Demand</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Easy Rider</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Dennis Hopper (US, 1969) \u2013 out now</strong></p> <p>One of the first films about the counterculture by those living within the counterculture that truly ruptured the Hollywood status quo and achieved massive commercial success. Dennis Hopper\u2019s Easy Rider speeds and careers across the US as its two biker protagonists (Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda) ride the deserts and plains from California to New Orleans, fuelled by the proceeds of a cocaine deal and a lot of marijuana. The plot \u2013 getting rich from a drug deal, walking away from society \u2013 carries within it the seed of the counterculture\u2019s implosion, as does the film\u2019s explosion into periodic, nonchalant violence. This version, as part of a 1969 anthology by SBS On Demand, includes a rambling, informative introduction and intermission by Quentin Tarantino.</p> <h2><strong>Neruda</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Pablo Larrain (Chile/Argentina/Spain/France/US, 2016) \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5es09qC0zpQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5es09qC0zpQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In the creeping conservatism of late 1940s Chile, a determined yet delusional police officer (Gael Garcia Bernal) hunts for the leftist poet and politician Pablo Neruda, who has gone underground fearing for his safety. And yet, thankfully, this is no straight Neruda biopic. Toggling between noir mystery, realism and surrealist stylisation, the film rests on the dramatic irony that a more sinister repressive force \u2013 the full-blown dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet \u2013 haunts the story\u2019s future. Like Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larrain\u2019s previous drama, Jackie, Neruda renovates the biopic genre, filtering politics and history through myth and paranoia.</p> <h2><strong>War Games</strong></h2> <p><strong>By John Badham (US, 1983) \u2013 until 10 September</strong></p> <p>A cold war-era sci-fi in which a cool brainiac teenager David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) risks nuclear war by hacking a military computer. Popular American cinema is full of spaces \u2013 lockers, high school corridors, change rooms, malls \u2013 where teens have their own freedom and social lives beyond the oversight of teachers and parents. The genius of War Games is to create that space in the realm of video games, while the era\u2019s greater, realer, geopolitical monsters \u2013 militaristic adults with their dirty hands on the nuclear buttons \u2013 float nefariously in the background.</p> <h2><strong>Backtrack Boys</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Catherine Scott (Australia, 2018) \u2013 15 September</strong></p> <p>A luminous observational documentary charting a group of at-risk boys\u2019 rocky \u2013 and maybe impossible \u2013 path to redemption in country New South Wales. Jackaroo Bernie Shakeshaft gives forgotten kids a second chance, entrusting them with responsibility as he trains them in dog-jumping. For kids like Zac and Rusty (who has a legendary command of cuss words), BackTrack Youth Works is their last chance at evading detention. Yet the director, Catherine Scott, doesn\u2019t take the easy route of a tale of optimism against hardship. She also shows the very real and long-term effects of trauma and poverty on young people. A brilliant local documentary.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>The Straight Story, Liberal Arts, Youth (films, out now), Gourmet Farmer (Thursdays from 19 September), The X Files (7.30pm weeknights on Viceland), If You Are the One (Saturdays).</p> <h2><em><strong>ABC iView</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Content</strong></h2> <p><strong>By </strong><strong>Daley Pearson, Walter Woodman and Anna Barnes (Australia, 2019) \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGRWvivMjHM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MGRWvivMjHM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Following Sally Potter\u2019s mobile-phone art-film Rage (2009), an innovation in format \u2013 a portrait-formatted series, shot and designed to be viewed upright on a smartphone \u2013 proves to be more than a gimmick. A funny, candid performance by Charlotte Nicdao brings both empathy and satire to the pink-haired figure of Lucy, a millennial influencer hungry for fame and acceptance, and willing to shoot any tragedy that befalls her (a bad hair day, a car crash) for clicks. Content digs into the banality of 21st century online life.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Mad As Hell (Wednesdays), Rewind: 40 Years of My Brilliant Career (out now), The Mix (Saturdays).</p> <h2><em><strong>Mubi</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski retrospective</strong></h2> <p><strong>Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski (Poland, France) \u2013 through September</strong></p> <p>In the works of Polish master Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, Mubi \u2013 a streaming service that curates and screens hard-to-find art cinema every day for a month \u2013 has found an eerie historical pre-memory for the political cinema and disasters of today. This retrospective takes us from Kie\u015blowski\u2019s bleakest work \u2013 No End (1985), which moves between domestic tragedy, ghostly encounters and political-legal drama under Polish martial law \u2013 to the devastating Three Colours trilogy of the 1990s. Authoritarian, cold war-era Poland provides the backdrop to many of the films with the terrors of the day manifesting in strange, sad ways for each of his protagonists.</p>",

Two years later Chinese companies ramped up their investment in US manufacturing and reopened the shuttered factories. This politically intelligent documentary \u2013 the first distributed by the Obamas\u2019 film company \u2013 presents an unusual global twist in the story of post-industrial decline, and resists the simplistic positive narratives of many social-impact documentaries that have debuted at the Sundance film festival. The Core By Jon Amiel (US, 2003) \u2013 out now A glimpse into a culture of big, dumb, popular cinema that\u2019s entirely different from today\u2019s. The post-cold war period gave way to a raft of disaster blockbusters in which America\u2019s enemy wasn\u2019t geopolitical but of the Earth and the cosmos. Here a group of scientists (Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci) fight a geological Armageddon, journeying to the centre of the planet to jumpstart its molten core with a massive detonation device. Quasi science fiction at its satisfyingly silliest. Honourable mentions: The Edge of Democracy, Elena, Olmo and the Seagull, World War Z, Revolutionary Road (films, out now), War of the Worlds (film, 15 September), Between Two Ferns: The Movie (20 September), The Good Place (season 4, 27 September), Ingrid Goes West (film, 28 September). Stan Killing Eve By Phoebe Waller-Bridge (UK, 2018) \u2013 5 September One of the finest shows of last year, Killing Eve\u2019s first season inverted so many exhausted cliches of the crime genre: the cat-and-mouse chase, the obsessive relationship between cops and crims, the male-dominated intelligence agencies, the ice-cold sociopath. Two women \u2013 Eve (Sandra Oh), a bumbling yet intuitive MI5 agent, and Villanelle (Jodie Comer), a flamboyant and individualistic assassin \u2013 fall in love across chasms of law and logic. Seductive, stressful, surprising until the very last scene. Creed II By Steven Caplan Jr (US, 2018) \u2013 6 September Michael B Jordan returns as Adonis Creed, whose new boxing adversary, the steroidal Viktor Drago, is the son of the man who killed his father. Adonis\u2019s quest to obliterate Drago alienates both his trainer Rocky Balboa (creakily charismatic Sylvester Stallone, also on board as screenwriter) and his partner Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Though it doesn\u2019t scale the heights of the first Creed film, this sequel deftly touches on enough conventions of glorious sports-drama-epics \u2013 a once poverty-stricken star with a chip on his shoulder, a date with destiny that becomes obsessive, a tragic family backstory, the clash of two patrilineal sporting dynasties, a great training montage \u2013 to make a new outing in the Rocky franchise worthwhile. Che: Part One and Che: Part Two By Steven Soderbergh (US, 2008) \u2013 26 September Writer-director Steven Soderbergh brings his most gritty, inscrutable sensibility to the story of the Argentinian Marxist revolutionary, guerrilla leader and intellectual, Che Guevara. Rolling from 1955 into the early days of the Cuban revolution, Soderbergh has no interest in the usual dichotomised vision of Guevara as either a hero or a tyrant. Benicio Del Toro\u2019s Che is a doomed, dogged, complicated man, and the film \u2013 almost entirely in Spanish \u2013 sheds the populist restrictions of a conventional biopic for something more sprawling, difficult and interesting. Mean Girls By Mark Waters (US, 2004) \u2013 18 September New girl Cady (Lindsay Lohan) engages in a misplaced campaign to ascend her new school\u2019s hierarchy of cliques, betraying her friends (Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese) to unseat the meanest, coolest girl in school, Regina George (Rachel McAdams). Writer Tina Fey is the true auteurist voice of this classic teen film, which cleverly lances all the genre\u2019s touchstone themes: female competition, an impossible desire for popularity, the glorification of social outcasts, and revenge quests by said outcasts. Still fetch. Synecdoche, New York By Charlie Kaufman (US, 2008) \u2013 29 September Sony Pictures asked filmmaker Charlie Kaufman to conceptualise a horror film and he came up with the most existential idea possible. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Caden, a disillusioned hypochondriac playwright who abandons the stage to create a lifelong, unscripted work of theatre in a New York warehouse that plays out in real time. Kaufman\u2019s profoundly melancholic film surrenders realism to realise Caden\u2019s dream \u2013 to relinquish the pretence of staged writing and bridge the gap between art and life \u2013 which is as ambitious and beautiful as it is impossible. In Kaufman\u2019s vision, realised with a heartbreaking performance by Hoffman, is that the things that really scare us \u2013 the inevitability of illness, disappointment, mortality and loneliness \u2013 aren\u2019t otherworldly. They\u2019re real. Honourable mentions: The Immigrant (film, 14 September), True Grit (film, 17 September), Meet the Parents (film, 27 September), Forrest Gump (film, 29 September), Fatal Attraction (film, 30 September), Broad City (season 5, 30 September). Foxtel Now Succession (season two) By Jesse Armstrong and Adam McKay (US, 2019) \u2013 Mondays The meanest show on TV, Succession brings the US\u2019s problems \u2013 inequality, wealth obsession, dynastic war and patriarchal obsolescence \u2013 into singular focus through an uber-rich business family. Season one ended with Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) abdicating his ambitions to usurp his father Logan (a dead-eyed Brian Cox), an avatar for Rupert Murdoch who also began his media empire decades before digitisation. Season two sees Shiv (Australian Sarah Snook blooming in droll, non-homicidal sociopath mode) begin the ascendancy to take her father\u2019s place as chief executive and position the family at the top of the media game again. A dark, bleakly funny view of the transactional nature of family for the super-rich, written by Jesse Armstrong (Peep Show, The Thick of It). Bridge of Spies By Steven Spielberg (US, 2015) \u2013 17 September Steven Spielberg\u2019s late era sees him working far outside the blockbuster cycle of his early days \u2013 the pure genre works of Indiana Jones, Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which were all stories of childhood heroes, boyhood dreams and family cohesion. Spielberg now mythologises whistleblowers, journalists and maverick spies. After the dialogue-driven Lincoln, Bridge of Spies masks another excursion into US political history. In this action-inflected tale in the dead of the cold war, Tom Hanks plays an idealistic lawyer working to save his country \u2013 and a KGB agent (Mark Rylance) \u2013 from menace of the Soviets. Taut, thrilling, morally alert, and fascinating in how patriotic American liberals narrativise world history. Honourable mentions: Catch Me If You Can (film, out now), Veronica Guerin (film, 8 September), Collateral (film, 30 September). SBS On Demand Easy Rider By Dennis Hopper (US, 1969) \u2013 out now One of the first films about the counterculture by those living within the counterculture that truly ruptured the Hollywood status quo and achieved massive commercial success. Dennis Hopper\u2019s Easy Rider speeds and careers across the US as its two biker protagonists (Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda) ride the deserts and plains from California to New Orleans, fuelled by the proceeds of a cocaine deal and a lot of marijuana. The plot \u2013 getting rich from a drug deal, walking away from society \u2013 carries within it the seed of the counterculture\u2019s implosion, as does the film\u2019s explosion into periodic, nonchalant violence. This version, as part of a 1969 anthology by SBS On Demand, includes a rambling, informative introduction and intermission by Quentin Tarantino. Neruda By Pablo Larrain (Chile/Argentina/Spain/France/US, 2016) \u2013 out now In the creeping conservatism of late 1940s Chile, a determined yet delusional police officer (Gael Garcia Bernal) hunts for the leftist poet and politician Pablo Neruda, who has gone underground fearing for his safety. And yet, thankfully, this is no straight Neruda biopic. Toggling between noir mystery, realism and surrealist stylisation, the film rests on the dramatic irony that a more sinister repressive force \u2013 the full-blown dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet \u2013 haunts the story\u2019s future. Like Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larrain\u2019s previous drama, Jackie, Neruda renovates the biopic genre, filtering politics and history through myth and paranoia. War Games By John Badham (US, 1983) \u2013 until 10 September A cold war-era sci-fi in which a cool brainiac teenager David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) risks nuclear war by hacking a military computer. Popular American cinema is full of spaces \u2013 lockers, high school corridors, change rooms, malls \u2013 where teens have their own freedom and social lives beyond the oversight of teachers and parents. The genius of War Games is to create that space in the realm of video games, while the era\u2019s greater, realer, geopolitical monsters \u2013 militaristic adults with their dirty hands on the nuclear buttons \u2013 float nefariously in the background. Backtrack Boys By Catherine Scott (Australia, 2018) \u2013 15 September A luminous observational documentary charting a group of at-risk boys\u2019 rocky \u2013 and maybe impossible \u2013 path to redemption in country New South Wales. Jackaroo Bernie Shakeshaft gives forgotten kids a second chance, entrusting them with responsibility as he trains them in dog-jumping. For kids like Zac and Rusty (who has a legendary command of cuss words), BackTrack Youth Works is their last chance at evading detention. Yet the director, Catherine Scott, doesn\u2019t take the easy route of a tale of optimism against hardship. She also shows the very real and long-term effects of trauma and poverty on young people. A brilliant local documentary. Honourable mentions: The Straight Story, Liberal Arts, Youth (films, out now), Gourmet Farmer (Thursdays from 19 September), The X Files (7.30pm weeknights on Viceland), If You Are the One (Saturdays). ABC iView Content By Daley Pearson, Walter Woodman and Anna Barnes (Australia, 2019) \u2013 out now Following Sally Potter\u2019s mobile-phone art-film Rage (2009), an innovation in format \u2013 a portrait-formatted series, shot and designed to be viewed upright on a smartphone \u2013 proves to be more than a gimmick. A funny, candid performance by Charlotte Nicdao brings both empathy and satire to the pink-haired figure of Lucy, a millennial influencer hungry for fame and acceptance, and willing to shoot any tragedy that befalls her (a bad hair day, a car crash) for clicks. Content digs into the banality of 21st century online life. Honourable mentions: Mad As Hell (Wednesdays), Rewind: 40 Years of My Brilliant Career (out now), The Mix (Saturdays). Mubi Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski retrospective Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski (Poland, France) \u2013 through September In the works of Polish master Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, Mubi \u2013 a streaming service that curates and screens hard-to-find art cinema every day for a month \u2013 has found an eerie historical pre-memory for the political cinema and disasters of today. This retrospective takes us from Kie\u015blowski\u2019s bleakest work \u2013 No End (1985), which moves between domestic tragedy, ghostly encounters and political-legal drama under Polish martial law \u2013 to the devastating Three Colours trilogy of the 1990s. Authoritarian, cold war-era Poland provides the backdrop to many of the films with the terrors of the day manifesting in strange, sad ways for each of his protagonists.",

      "bodyText": "Suspended Labor boss Kaila Murnain has agreed she compromised Labor and cast an \u201cunfair shadow\u201d over the entire party by keeping quiet about the acceptance of unlawful donations from Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo. Murnain cried as she was cross-examined on Friday by lawyers representing the Labor party, a party she said was \u201cliterally the only thing that mattered to me except for my family\u201d. Evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption shows Murnain failed to say anything about allegedly unlawful donations from Huang for more than three years, despite an electoral commission investigation and repeated media scandals involving Labor\u2019s links to the Chinese property developer. Labor\u2019s barrister, Arthur Moses, SC, apologised to Murnain before asking her whether her actions had compromised the party. Moses suggested Murnain\u2019s choices left the party oblivious to the controversy and unable to identify attempts by those trying to exert influence on Labor. \u201cDo you accept though that by not disclosing this information to the party officers and the administrative committee, that you in fact compromised the party?\u201d Moses said. Murnain responded: \u201cIn hindsight, I wish I would have made very different decisions.\u201d She later agreed when Moses suggested her actions had \u201ccast an unfair shadow over the entire party and its members, who are honest and decent Australians\u201d. Murnain told Icac she first learned of the Huang donation on 16 September 2016, during an evening meeting out the back of state parliament with former MP Ernest Wong. Murnain has claimed she then sought an urgent meeting with the party\u2019s lawyer Ian Robertson. She said she was advised to tell no one about the revelations, and has used the advice to explain her inaction. Earlier on Friday, Murnain was accused of being caught out by a key detail in her account of the Robertson meeting. Her evidence was that Robertson said he would not bill her for the advice about the Huang matter. But an invoice produced to Icac on Friday shows Labor was billed for a meeting and phone calls between Murnain and Robertson on 16 September 2016 to discuss \u201cpolitical donation issues\u201d. Robertson\u2019s barrister, Tony McInerney, says the meeting was likely to have been about a concurrent yet separate donations matter involving Labor state MP Nick Lalich. Other documents show Murnain, then Labor leader Luke Foley, and Labor\u2019s lawyers were talking about the Lalich matter on the same day. McInerney accused Murnain of a \u201ccomplete fabrication\u201d. \u201cYou came unstuck, didn\u2019t you, with your version of events once you added in that Mr Robertson said he would not be billing you for the meeting, correct?\u201d he said. Murnain responded: \u201cI did not.\u201d McInerney said: \u201cYour evidence that he wouldn\u2019t be billing you for the meeting is a complete fabrication, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Murnain rejected the allegation. McInerney has sought to cast doubt on the plausibility that Robertson would advise Labor to \u201ceffectively cover up\u201d the unlawful donations. At the time, at least five people knew of irregularities with the donations, journalists were investigating Huang\u2019s links to the Labor party, and the electoral commission was investigating, the inquiry has heard. McInerney on Friday accused Murnain of telling a \u201cpack of lies\u201d. \u201cMs Murnain, your evidence to this commission has been a pack of lies hasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. Murnain responded: \u201cNo.\u201d The inquiry heard Murnain had repeatedly failed to say anything of several key meetings \u2013 including the Robertson meeting \u2013 when Labor was approached by the electoral commission or, later, Icac. \u201cHindsight is a wonderful thing and obviously I would do things differently if I could got back to that time,\u201d Murnain said. She said nothing of several key meetings \u2013 including the Robertson meeting \u2013 when she first gave evidence in private to Icac. She subsequently volunteered to come back for a second private examination, after refreshing her memory and deciding it was \u201cthe right thing\u201d to do. The commission is investigating whether Huang gave $100,000 in an Aldi bag to then Labor general secretary, Jamie Clements. Huang is barred from donating in NSW because of his property development links. It is alleged a series of straw donors and falsified records were used to mask Huang\u2019s contribution. Huang issued a statement overnight denying any involvement in the donation. He has refused offers to give evidence under oath. The inquiry continues before chief commissioner Peter Hall.",

      "bodyText": "The Solomon Islands intends to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and align itself with Beijing, the leader of a high-level government team representing the South Pacific archipelago has said. The switch, which still needs to be formalised, would be a prize for China in its bid to peel away allies from what it considers a wayward province with no right to state-to-state ties. Only 17 countries now recognise Taiwan. The Solomons\u2019 foreign relations committee began hearings into the issue this week, looking into the question of whether to sever existing ties with Taiwan. The committee will present their report to parliament for deliberation. Solomons lawmaker Peter Shanel Agovaka told a parliamentary committee that after four decades of independence and a long-term alliance with Taiwan, it was time to make a change. \u201cWe cannot sit for the next 40 years with our friends Taiwan. It is time that we make new friends - it\u2019s time that we should move on with our life,\u201d Agovaka said on Wednesday, according to a recording of the meeting in the capital Honiara. \u201cOur new relationship will deal with a One China policy; a One China policy that recognises only Beijing as the official government administration,\u201d he said in the recording, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. The meeting was open to the public, but the recording has not been broadcast. Agovaka is a senior minister and leader of a government team convened recently to speak directly with Beijing. However, on Friday Taiwan warned the Solomon Islands that relationships with China has left some Pacific nations in a \u201cdebt trap\u201d. \u201cChina\u2019s expansion in the Pacific has made many countries to fall into the trap of debt,\u201d Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry, told Reuters. \u201cThe flashy infrastructure that China promised has caused serious damage to the local ecosystem and infringed their sovereignty,\u201d she said. China and Taiwan have fought a tug-of-war for diplomatic recognition in the South Pacific for decades, with some island nations switching allegiances for financial gain. The South Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six of the 16 island nations make up more than a third of its total alliances. In June, the Guardian learned that the Solomon Islands planned to make a decision about whether to transfer its allegiance to China within 100 days \u2013 bringing it to mid-September. The timeframe for the decision was set out by the Solomon Islands\u2019 foreign minister Jeremiah Manele during a bilateral meeting with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison on Monday, but the sensitive discussion was not meant to be made public. Solomon Islands has been assessing its Taiwan alliance since new prime minister Manasseh Sogavare took control after a general election in April and started looking for ways to improve the country\u2019s economic prospects. The former British protectorate, an archipelago of just over 600,000 people, relies on timber exports to generate income. The Solomons have recognised Taiwan since 1983. It is the largest of the Taiwan-aligned Pacific countries, with access to the airfields and deepwater ports dating back to World War Two. But, a diplomatic shift threatens to divide the island nation, with 16 MPs citing potential \u201ccompromised freedoms\u201d as a reason against the switch in an open letter last month, while the country\u2019s university student population is largely backing Taiwan. Anti-graft agency Transparency Solomon Islands has urged caution in changing ties over concerns that the Solomons will not be able to hold firm against Beijing\u2019s interests. China is offering to bankroll a development fund for the Solomons to help with a transition away from Taiwan, which currently provides an annual $8.5 million contribution to the island nation. The Lowy Institute said in a report last month that Canberra and Washington are concerned about the Solomons switching recognition to Beijing. \u201cA switch by any one (of the states that recognise Taiwan) may stimulate others\u201d to abandon Taipei, the Australia-based think-tank said. The number of nations recognising Taiwan has been dwindling, with El Salvador in Central America, Burkina Faso in West Africa and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, all switching to China last year.",

      "body": "<p> </p> \n<h2>Top story: Mugabe, from hero to tyrant</h2> \n<p>Good morning and welcome to this Friday briefing with Alison Rourke on what has been an extraordinary week in politics by any measure.</p> \n<p>Robert Mugabe, the former president of Zimbabwe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/robert-mugabe-former-zimbabwean-president-dies-aged-95\">has died aged 95</a>. The news was announced by the country\u2019s current president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, this morning. It is believed Mugabe died in Singapore, where he had been a frequent visitor to receive medical care in recent months as his health has deteriorated. As far back as November 2018, Mnangagwa, who took over from him as president, told members of the ruling Zanu-PF party that Mugabe could no longer walk.</p> \n<p>Mugabe was a hero of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence struggle and became the country\u2019s leader in 1978 before his decades-long rule descended into tyranny, corruption and incompetence. Though once widely celebrated for his role in fighting the white supremacist regime in his homeland, known as Rhodesia under colonial rule, Mugabe had long become a deeply divisive figure in his own country and across the continent. His final years in power were characterised by financial collapse, surges of violent intimidation and a power struggle pitting his wife Grace, 41 years younger, against Mnangagwa, his former righthand man.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Johnson goes north \u2013</strong> Boris Johnson heads to Aberdeenshire today to meet farmers with a promise of \u00a3200m in extra funding for the industry \u2013 and to shore up his Brexit stance. He will be hoping for a warmer welcome north of the border than during a walkabout in Yorkshire yesterday. One resident in the Leeds suburb of Morley harangued him for not being in Brussels while another shook his hand, and then<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/walkabout-goes-awry-for-johnson-in-straight-talking-yorkshire\"> politely asked him to leave</a>, spawning a the hashtag #PleaseLeaveMyTown. Coupled with his brother Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation, it was a grim day for the PM. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/jo-johnson-quits-as-mp-and-minister-citing-national-interest\">dramatic move by the younger Johnson</a>, who had only recently returned to government, sent shockwaves through the Conservative party and appeared to rattle his brother. The prime minister visited a police training academy where he said he would rather \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than bow to the demands of the no-deal bill and request at Brexit extension. He also acknowledged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/a-family-divided-how-brexit-fractured-the-johnsons\">\u201cBrexit divides families\u201d</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3206211c-043a-4476-8eec-ab375df05624\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hOhsx8-AocQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So what happens next? Jeremy Corbyn is poised to reject <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-likely-to-seek-election-for-second-time-next-week\">the PM\u2019s demand for a 15 October election for a second time on Monday</a>, with Labour fearing it would play into Johnson\u2019s hands. The Guardian understands no final decision has been made about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/corbyn-poised-to-reject-demand-for-15-october-election\"> Labour\u2019s tactics next week</a>, but one option is a vote of no confidence. If the government lost, it would be followed by a 14-day period during which MPs could seek to put together an alternative majority.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, the Brexit chaos is providing plenty of material for columnists. Simon Jenkins writes that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/06/prime-minister-war-rhetoric-trade-negotiations\">PM revels in bellicose, war-like rhetoric</a>, but it could see him hoisted on his own petard. \u201cHe and his allies have turned a technical debate about trade policy into a Battle of Britain,\u201d he writes . \u201cThey suggest ludicrously that the national economy faces an existential threat from Europe.\u201d Lynsey Hanley writes that Johnson wrongly thinks a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/06/working-class-voters-culture-war-quality-of-life\"> \u201cculture war\u201d will win crucial working-class votes</a>.

The storm is now skirting the coast of North Carolina as it heads north-east. But in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bahamas\">Bahamas</a> it has left such terrible devastation that authorities are still struggling to get aid to stricken areas and the death toll is expected to rise, perhaps steeply. According to local media the government has taken delivery of at least 200 body bags. Lu\u00edz David Rodriguez, the programme manager for Direct Relief, an NGO, said the island\u2019s main health clinic, near Marsh Harbour, was being overwhelmed with hundreds of people waiting to be treated. \u201cLots of people are just laying around,\u201d he said, \u201cwaiting to get off the island. People are getting a little desperate.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69ed2c97-b737-4bdf-a3ac-802c1937a8e6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wuAwuVbprNA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Take back Isis fighters </strong>\u2013 The US defence secretary says the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/britain-must-repatriate-isis-fighters-warns-us-defence-secretary\">must take back</a> the estimated 250-300 foreign fighters who are still in Syria. \u201cOur view has been they should repatriated and dealt with appropriately \u2026 otherwise that\u2019s a risk to the region,\u201d Mark Esper said at the start of his London visit. Esper estimated there are around 2,000 foreign fighters many from Europe, being held in north-east Syria, but Britain is increasingly unwilling to allow any to return and stand trial. It will make for an interesting conversation between Esper and the defence secretary Ben Wallace today.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Turn the lights out\u2019 </strong>\u2013 Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has told an international summit on demography that it was was conceivable that his country, with a fast-shrinking population of just under 10 million, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/viktor-orban-trumpets-far-right-procreation-anti-immigration-policy\">could simply disappear.</a> \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine that there would be one single last man who has to turn the lights out,\u201d he said. Orb\u00e1n, who has based his political campaigns in recent years on anti-refugee and anti-migration sentiment, said other European politicians saw immigration as the solution, but he firmly rejected this, tapping into the far-right \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory. \u201cThere are political forces in Europe who want a replacement of population for ideological or other reasons,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Nazi grandpa\u2019 </strong>\u2013 A German man is being sued by the owners of a four-star hotel in the Austria Alps after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/german-tourist-sued-complaints-hotel-nazi-portraits-austria\">posting online reviews in which he criticised them </a>for decorating their lobby with a portrait of a \u201cNazi grandpa\u201d in a uniform adorned with a swastika. \u201cThis incident speaks volumes about the current state of affairs in this region of Austria,\u201d the review of the guesthouse said. A lawyer acting for the owner said the portraits had been hung in the lobby in remembrance of late relatives. In July a court took the unusual step of granting a preliminary injunction against the reviewer, arguing that his posts had implied that the hotel owner shared or sympathised with Nazi ideas. The trial is expected to continue until later in the year, but the hotel owners\u2019 lawyer said the family had since removed the portraits.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Neighbours spin off</strong> \u2013 The Australian TV soap Neighbours, a staple on British screens for 33 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/06/neighbours-goes-back-to-school-in-spin-off-miniseries-erinsborough-high\">has spawned a spin-off miniseries </a>set in the local high school in the sunny fictional suburb of Erinsborough.

The family of the dead man, Frank Olson, was shocked that he might have taken his own life. The funeral was held with a closed casket. Olson\u2019s death was a near-disaster for the CIA. It came close to threatening the very existence of MK-Ultra, the top-secret programme of experiments in mind control that used, as its basic formula, doses of LSD given to \u201cexpendables\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Mugabe, from hero to tyrant Good morning and welcome to this Friday briefing with Alison Rourke on what has been an extraordinary week in politics by any measure. Robert Mugabe, the former president of Zimbabwe, has died aged 95. The news was announced by the country\u2019s current president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, this morning. It is believed Mugabe died in Singapore, where he had been a frequent visitor to receive medical care in recent months as his health has deteriorated. As far back as November 2018, Mnangagwa, who took over from him as president, told members of the ruling Zanu-PF party that Mugabe could no longer walk. Mugabe was a hero of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence struggle and became the country\u2019s leader in 1978 before his decades-long rule descended into tyranny, corruption and incompetence. Though once widely celebrated for his role in fighting the white supremacist regime in his homeland, known as Rhodesia under colonial rule, Mugabe had long become a deeply divisive figure in his own country and across the continent. His final years in power were characterised by financial collapse, surges of violent intimidation and a power struggle pitting his wife Grace, 41 years younger, against Mnangagwa, his former righthand man. * * * Johnson goes north \u2013 Boris Johnson heads to Aberdeenshire today to meet farmers with a promise of \u00a3200m in extra funding for the industry \u2013 and to shore up his Brexit stance. He will be hoping for a warmer welcome north of the border than during a walkabout in Yorkshire yesterday. One resident in the Leeds suburb of Morley harangued him for not being in Brussels while another shook his hand, and then politely asked him to leave, spawning a the hashtag #PleaseLeaveMyTown. Coupled with his brother Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation, it was a grim day for the PM. The dramatic move by the younger Johnson, who had only recently returned to government, sent shockwaves through the Conservative party and appeared to rattle his brother. The prime minister visited a police training academy where he said he would rather \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than bow to the demands of the no-deal bill and request at Brexit extension. He also acknowledged that \u201cBrexit divides families\u201d. So what happens next? Jeremy Corbyn is poised to reject the PM\u2019s demand for a 15 October election for a second time on Monday, with Labour fearing it would play into Johnson\u2019s hands. The Guardian understands no final decision has been made about Labour\u2019s tactics next week, but one option is a vote of no confidence. If the government lost, it would be followed by a 14-day period during which MPs could seek to put together an alternative majority. If nothing else, the Brexit chaos is providing plenty of material for columnists. Simon Jenkins writes that the PM revels in bellicose, war-like rhetoric, but it could see him hoisted on his own petard. \u201cHe and his allies have turned a technical debate about trade policy into a Battle of Britain,\u201d he writes . \u201cThey suggest ludicrously that the national economy faces an existential threat from Europe.\u201d Lynsey Hanley writes that Johnson wrongly thinks a \u201cculture war\u201d will win crucial working-class votes. And John Crace calls it as he sees it: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s speech at a police academy in Wakefield was the shitshow to end all shitshows.\u201d * * * Dorian death toll rises \u2013 Thirty people are believed to have died in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian wreaked havoc across the archipelago. The storm is now skirting the coast of North Carolina as it heads north-east. But in the Bahamas it has left such terrible devastation that authorities are still struggling to get aid to stricken areas and the death toll is expected to rise, perhaps steeply. According to local media the government has taken delivery of at least 200 body bags. Lu\u00edz David Rodriguez, the programme manager for Direct Relief, an NGO, said the island\u2019s main health clinic, near Marsh Harbour, was being overwhelmed with hundreds of people waiting to be treated. \u201cLots of people are just laying around,\u201d he said, \u201cwaiting to get off the island. People are getting a little desperate.\u201d * * * Take back Isis fighters \u2013 The US defence secretary says the UK must take back the estimated 250-300 foreign fighters who are still in Syria. \u201cOur view has been they should repatriated and dealt with appropriately \u2026 otherwise that\u2019s a risk to the region,\u201d Mark Esper said at the start of his London visit. Esper estimated there are around 2,000 foreign fighters many from Europe, being held in north-east Syria, but Britain is increasingly unwilling to allow any to return and stand trial. It will make for an interesting conversation between Esper and the defence secretary Ben Wallace today. * * * \u2018Turn the lights out\u2019 \u2013 Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has told an international summit on demography that it was was conceivable that his country, with a fast-shrinking population of just under 10 million, could simply disappear. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine that there would be one single last man who has to turn the lights out,\u201d he said. Orb\u00e1n, who has based his political campaigns in recent years on anti-refugee and anti-migration sentiment, said other European politicians saw immigration as the solution, but he firmly rejected this, tapping into the far-right \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory. \u201cThere are political forces in Europe who want a replacement of population for ideological or other reasons,\u201d he said. * * * \u2018Nazi grandpa\u2019 \u2013 A German man is being sued by the owners of a four-star hotel in the Austria Alps after posting online reviews in which he criticised them for decorating their lobby with a portrait of a \u201cNazi grandpa\u201d in a uniform adorned with a swastika. \u201cThis incident speaks volumes about the current state of affairs in this region of Austria,\u201d the review of the guesthouse said. A lawyer acting for the owner said the portraits had been hung in the lobby in remembrance of late relatives. In July a court took the unusual step of granting a preliminary injunction against the reviewer, arguing that his posts had implied that the hotel owner shared or sympathised with Nazi ideas. The trial is expected to continue until later in the year, but the hotel owners\u2019 lawyer said the family had since removed the portraits. * * * Neighbours spin off \u2013 The Australian TV soap Neighbours, a staple on British screens for 33 years, has spawned a spin-off miniseries set in the local high school in the sunny fictional suburb of Erinsborough. Erinsborough High is a five-episode series focusing on the teenage cast during their final exams \u2013 more than three decades after Charlene (Kylie Minogue) and Scott (Jason Donovan) graduated from the same school. The 22-minute episodes will be streamed on Channel 5\u2019s VOD platform My5n from 11 November. Today in Focus podcast: Malcolm Gladwell on the consequences of misreading a stranger Writer Malcolm Gladwell examines our interactions with strangers, and what can happen when they go wrong. Plus: Daniel Boffey on the view from Brussels after a chaotic week in British politics. Lunchtime read: The CIA\u2019s darkest secrets A death at a Manhattan hotel in 1953 seemed like a regular incident to police on the scene: a distressed man had taken his own life. They could not have known that the dead man was a scientist who had worked on the US government\u2019s most highly classified intelligence programmes. The family of the dead man, Frank Olson, was shocked that he might have taken his own life. The funeral was held with a closed casket. Olson\u2019s death was a near-disaster for the CIA. It came close to threatening the very existence of MK-Ultra, the top-secret programme of experiments in mind control that used, as its basic formula, doses of LSD given to \u201cexpendables\u201d. The truth would only emerge decades later. Sport England face an uphill battle to keep their Ashes hopes alive after a scolding from Joe Root was followed by the agony of watching Steve Smith pile on a masterful double-century in Manchester, where two and a half hours of spills, thrills and bellyaches put Australia almost out of sight in the fourth Test. Serena Williams is back in the US Open final after a one-sided win over Elina Svitolina. The title-decider is tomorrow against Canada\u2019s Bianca Andreescu, who saw off Belinda Bencic in the other semi-final. In the men\u2019s draw at Flushing Meadows, Grigor Dimitrov\u2019s return to form has been dramatic but his semi-final opponent Daniil Medvedev has emerged from the NextGen pack as the best player outside the big three. Anthony Joshua, touching down briefly in New York, desperately wanted to return to the scene of the crime to reclaim his world heavyweight titles but he has settled instead for meeting his conqueror in Saudi Arabia. England\u2019s visit to Newcastle for their last World Cup warm-up, against Italy on Friday, suits Mark Wilson, the former Falcon flanker, as well as northern rugby fans. And Lando Norris has admitted that the death of Anthoine Hubert last week had an impact that still affects the McLaren driver and his family. Business The pound has slipped back a little in early overnight trading after hitting a five-week high of $1.2353 amid the ebb and flow of events at Westminster. It is buying $1.2322 at the moment and it is worth \u20ac1.1166 in the single currency. The change in valuation of American office rental upstart WeWork has cast light on the febrile state of stock markets. We Co, WeWork\u2019s parent company, had been expected to list on the stock market valued at $47bn.

      "body": "<h2>Visit Aoishima shrine</h2> <p>The subtropical island of Aoshima, about 10 miles south of the city, is connected to a golden beach by a bridge straddling the ocean. The tiny island is surrounded by long furrows of black basalt \u2013 a geological phenomenon known locally as the \u201cdevil\u2019s washboard\u201d, created over millions of years of pounding waves. At the centre of the island is Aoshima shrine, a red Shinto shrine tucked into thick jungle and first established in 1501. It\u2019s dedicated to the god of matrimony, making it popular with couples \u2013 a reputation that solidified during Miyazaki\u2019s heyday in the 1970s, when about 35% of Japan\u2019s newlyweds would honeymoon here for the sun, sea and sand. Sunset is the best time to visit \u2013 sit by the shore on the north side of the island and watch the sun sink into the mountains on the mainland.<br>\u2022<em> Admission free, shrine open daily 5.30am-6.30pm, though outside these hours access to the island is still possible</em></p> <h2>Go surfing</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c42945f5dddd5869f3ad864e1d53ae3d125ecb22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c42945f5dddd5869f3ad864e1d53ae3d125ecb22/0_135_4264_2558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surfer Surfing On Sea Waves Against Clear Sky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Miyazaki has some of the best surf in Japan. The waves are long, even \u2013 and make you feel more talented than perhaps you are. The main action happens at sandy Kisakihama beach, a big, open break about eight miles south of the city centre, which will host surfing qualifiers for next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics from this weekend. Locals are always on the waves here, from sunrise to the last glimpse of light, but especially before 8am and after 6pm. In the evenings, a lot of surfers head to <a href=\"http://www.aoshimabeachpark.com/\" title=\"\">Aoshima Beach Park</a> (dishes from \u00a5500, around \u00a34), a 10-minute drive away, where a collection of beach shacks serve burgers, beer and \u201cnatural wine\u201d tapped straight from the barrel.<br></p> <h2>Eat Miyazaki chicken</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45122abfd6b556289af5f208a62e2b3506578b50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45122abfd6b556289af5f208a62e2b3506578b50/66_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Nanban at Ogura Honten, Miyazaki, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicken Nanban at Ogura Honten</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ogura Honten Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many Japanese towns and cities claim a regional dish or speciality as their own: in Kyoto it\u2019s tofu, Kobe takes beef and Miyazaki claims chicken. The prefecture\u2019s free-range <em>jitokko</em> breed is popular nationwide, with many claiming it to be the tastiest chicken in the world. Try the chicken <em>nanban</em>: succulent deep-fried pieces coated in a kind of creamy tartare sauce. Tourists often visit Ogura Honten (3 Chome-4-24 Tachibanadorihigashi) to try it (the dish was said to have originated here in the 1960s), though I prefer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/momotetsuen/?igshid=ftgyovzkj2o1&amp;fbclid=IwAR3Y_IKGwiyACHzAGu1QyBn9VhynCGqS436oLX--yn0ppCELRx_lTzoyRD4\" title=\"\">Momotetsuen</a>, an intimate restaurant-bar. Dishes here start from around \u00a33 and there is an eight-dish menu from \u00a327. I also recommend trying a dish called <em>jidori no sumibiyaki</em> (chicken grilled over charcoal, usually served with <em>yuzu kosho</em>, a spicy citrus seasoning). Many restaurants in Miyazaki serve chicken sashimi-style: raw. Maybe try it before you judge \u2013 it\u2019s really good.<br></p> <h2>Drink sh\u014dch\u016b</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d4be7228f5a314fc304b9dd57dce9fc5ccf70c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d4be7228f5a314fc304b9dd57dce9fc5ccf70c0/0_389_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glass of Shochu on a bar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pretty much every bar in Miyazaki serves <em>sh\u014dch\u016b</em>, a liquor made from rice, sweet potato or barley. While the west normally equates sake with Japan, on the south-western island of Kyushu (where Miyazaki is) sh\u014dch\u016b is king. It differs from sake in strength \u2013 usually 25%-30% compared with sake\u2019s 15%-18% \u2013 and it is distilled not fermented, giving it a stronger flavour and smell. Drink it with ice, though locals often mix it with a little cold water in summer and hot water in winter. In Miyazaki prefecture, as well as in neighbouring Kagoshima prefecture, <em>imoj\u014dch\u016b</em> (sh\u014dch\u016b made from sweet potato) is popular, having originated in this region. A great place to try it is Bar Rai on the corner of the Wakaksa-dori, one of the city\u2019s main bar areas. If straight sh\u014dch\u016b isn\u2019t your thing, the mixologists there will whisk up a <em>chuhai</em>, mixing sh\u014dch\u016b with juice or flavoured soda. <br>\u2022<em> </em><em>880-0805 Miyazaki, Tachibanadorihigashi, 3 Chome-2-12 2F, on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BAR-Rai-391214797608329/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a>; open daily from 6pm; </em><em>drinks </em><em>\u00a35.40</em></p> <h2>Stroll around Heiwadai Park</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dfdaa6512361bf4fcc248dfd9e94a7016a434d44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfdaa6512361bf4fcc248dfd9e94a7016a434d44/0_195_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tower of Peace at Heiwadai Park in Miyazaki, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heiwadai Park and peace tower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panithi Utamachant/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also known as Peace Park, Heiwadai lies on a hill above the city and is dominated by a \u201cpeace tower\u201d built in 1940 to celebrate the 2,600th anniversary of the ascension of Japan\u2019s first emperor. The tower was the starting point in the torch relay for Japan\u2019s 1964 Olympics. However, it has long caused contention among locals: it was rededicated in 1965 as a symbol of peace, having previously sought to honour Japan\u2019s imperialist legacy and ambition.

One of my favourite bathing spots is at Aoshima Cinq Male \u2013 a J-shaped hotel that juts out into the water. The online pictures don\u2019t show it but there\u2019s a small outdoor bath overlooking the ocean, tucked away on the side that visitors shouldn\u2019t overlook (be warned: you do have to enter it naked).

First-time visitors will probably find themselves around Ichibangai, lured by the neon lights, but drinking on your own here can be hard: many bars are several storeys up, so it\u2019s not possible to see what they look like (or if they\u2019re busy) before committing. So I\u2019d suggest drinking around Wakakusa. At first glance, this area looks more intimidating, with dimly-lit alleys that splinter off in different directions, but you only have to walk for a few minutes before you spot where the action is happening. Different places are busy on different nights, so follow your nose and ears to find the busy bars and good-smelling food. I often end up in Pollo, a bar that serves ice-cold sh\u014dch\u016b alongside deep-fried sticks of <em>kushiyaki</em> (vegetables, cheese, meat or fish that are coated in breadcrumbs and dipped in a sticky sauce).<br>\u2022<em> Pollo is on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/otona.no.kakurega.pollo/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a>, food from around \u00a34</em></p> <h2>Try zousui in the early hours</h2> <p>In most of Japan, the late-night equivalent of the kebab is ramen.

      "bodyText": "Visit Aoishima shrine The subtropical island of Aoshima, about 10 miles south of the city, is connected to a golden beach by a bridge straddling the ocean. The tiny island is surrounded by long furrows of black basalt \u2013 a geological phenomenon known locally as the \u201cdevil\u2019s washboard\u201d, created over millions of years of pounding waves. At the centre of the island is Aoshima shrine, a red Shinto shrine tucked into thick jungle and first established in 1501. It\u2019s dedicated to the god of matrimony, making it popular with couples \u2013 a reputation that solidified during Miyazaki\u2019s heyday in the 1970s, when about 35% of Japan\u2019s newlyweds would honeymoon here for the sun, sea and sand. Sunset is the best time to visit \u2013 sit by the shore on the north side of the island and watch the sun sink into the mountains on the mainland. \u2022 Admission free, shrine open daily 5.30am-6.30pm, though outside these hours access to the island is still possible Go surfing Miyazaki has some of the best surf in Japan. The waves are long, even \u2013 and make you feel more talented than perhaps you are. The main action happens at sandy Kisakihama beach, a big, open break about eight miles south of the city centre, which will host surfing qualifiers for next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics from this weekend. Locals are always on the waves here, from sunrise to the last glimpse of light, but especially before 8am and after 6pm. In the evenings, a lot of surfers head to Aoshima Beach Park (dishes from \u00a5500, around \u00a34), a 10-minute drive away, where a collection of beach shacks serve burgers, beer and \u201cnatural wine\u201d tapped straight from the barrel. Eat Miyazaki chicken Many Japanese towns and cities claim a regional dish or speciality as their own: in Kyoto it\u2019s tofu, Kobe takes beef and Miyazaki claims chicken. The prefecture\u2019s free-range jitokko breed is popular nationwide, with many claiming it to be the tastiest chicken in the world. Try the chicken nanban: succulent deep-fried pieces coated in a kind of creamy tartare sauce. Tourists often visit Ogura Honten (3 Chome-4-24 Tachibanadorihigashi) to try it (the dish was said to have originated here in the 1960s), though I prefer Momotetsuen, an intimate restaurant-bar. Dishes here start from around \u00a33 and there is an eight-dish menu from \u00a327. I also recommend trying a dish called jidori no sumibiyaki (chicken grilled over charcoal, usually served with yuzu kosho, a spicy citrus seasoning). Many restaurants in Miyazaki serve chicken sashimi-style: raw. Maybe try it before you judge \u2013 it\u2019s really good. Drink sh\u014dch\u016b Pretty much every bar in Miyazaki serves sh\u014dch\u016b, a liquor made from rice, sweet potato or barley. While the west normally equates sake with Japan, on the south-western island of Kyushu (where Miyazaki is) sh\u014dch\u016b is king. It differs from sake in strength \u2013 usually 25%-30% compared with sake\u2019s 15%-18% \u2013 and it is distilled not fermented, giving it a stronger flavour and smell. Drink it with ice, though locals often mix it with a little cold water in summer and hot water in winter. In Miyazaki prefecture, as well as in neighbouring Kagoshima prefecture, imoj\u014dch\u016b (sh\u014dch\u016b made from sweet potato) is popular, having originated in this region. A great place to try it is Bar Rai on the corner of the Wakaksa-dori, one of the city\u2019s main bar areas. If straight sh\u014dch\u016b isn\u2019t your thing, the mixologists there will whisk up a chuhai, mixing sh\u014dch\u016b with juice or flavoured soda. \u2022 880-0805 Miyazaki, Tachibanadorihigashi, 3 Chome-2-12 2F, on Facebook; open daily from 6pm; drinks \u00a35.40 Stroll around Heiwadai Park Also known as Peace Park, Heiwadai lies on a hill above the city and is dominated by a \u201cpeace tower\u201d built in 1940 to celebrate the 2,600th anniversary of the ascension of Japan\u2019s first emperor. The tower was the starting point in the torch relay for Japan\u2019s 1964 Olympics.

      "bodyText": "A HBO true-crime drama portraying the revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager following the murder of three Jewish youths has awakened traumatic memories five years later and sparked a backlash in Israel. Our Boys, a 10-part series that launched last month in Israel and the US, dramatises the summer of 2014, when Mohamed Abu Khdeir, a 16-year-old from East Jerusalem, was abducted, bludgeoned and burned to death. In both Hebrew and Arabic, the series tackles sensitive themes of racism, hatred, religious ideology and vengeance. Mixing real-life documentary footage and news reports into episodes, it creates an eerie familiarity of a time still raw in the memories of Israelis and Palestinians. The creators say the story is one of pain turning into revenge. Yet it is the focus on the investigation into Abu Khdeir\u2019s disappearance and murder \u2013 rather than that of the three Israeli victims \u2013 that has drawn angry criticism in Israel from the highest levels of government. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last week that the series \u201csoils Israel\u2019s reputation\u201d and called for a boycott of the Israeli TV company Keshet Studios, which co-created the show. Its directors, two Jewish Israelis and a Palestinian citizen of Israel, have received bitter threats online. On public review sites such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, Our Boys ratings have plummeted in what appears to be a coordinated effort to tarnish much of the positive acclaim it has already received. Episode one is filled with archival video of the mothers of the three Israelis \u2013 Eyal Yifrach, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Frankel, 16 \u2013 pleading for their release and praying for their survival during a two-and-a-half week hunt to find them alive. Their deaths at the hands of militants from the Islamist group Hamas stirred up rage. After their bodies were found, Abu Khdeir was snatched by Israelis outside his home and his death ignited some of the worst riots in Jerusalem for years. The killings of the four boys contributed to a steep spiral that ended with a 50-day war in the summer of 2014 between Israel and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip. \u201cWe live in an extremely nuanced world where wars erupt because of tiny things,\u201d Joseph Cedar, an Israeli co-director, said in an interview with Reuters. \u201cWe tried to peel back the layers of this hate crime.\u201d Knowing they were working on such an emotionally and politically charged subject, its creators attempted to hide the fact they were making Our Boys during production. One actor, who played a rabbi, left after he realised what it was about. Tawfik Abu Wael, the Palestinian co-director, has said he was pressured to withdraw his involvement after news of the series leaked early on, angering Palestinian activists who call for a boycott of Israel. \u201cI suddenly started to get calls from a lot of people I don\u2019t know telling me not to do it,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I had the power to stand in front of this pressure.\u201d Hagai Levi, an Israeli co-director who previously worked on Showtime\u2019s The Affair, has said the show\u2019s message is about the power of incitement. \u201cYou have leaders who are doing this. You only need one person to think: \u2018If people say: \u201cDeath to Arabs!\u201d we have to kill Arabs.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson wants war. He knows Britons love war, especially with Europe. He and his allies have turned a technical debate about trade policy into a Battle of Britain. They suggest ludicrously that the national economy faces an existential threat from Europe. They forget that in times of war countries seek to cohere, not descend into partisan strife. A single-issue general election, as Johnson now wants, would be irresponsible. His job as prime minister should be to get a deal on Brexit and not stall one, as he is blatantly doing. The most eerie Commons performance this week was by the minister for no deal, Michael Gove. He was like an air raid warden from Dad\u2019s Army. He had plans for supplies of medicines and food. Trucks were assigned to country lanes. Guards were reinforcing Dover. Two billion pounds will pour into farms, fisheries, manufacturing and hospitals. No expense will be spared, no cost too great, to keep the dastardly foreigner from our shores. MPs purred. They loved it. Last weekend was the 80th anniversary of the start of the second world war, and I counted 20 programmes about Nazis on British television. Johnson, in contrast, comes across as a mad general. In the Commons he was shrieking abuse at Jeremy Corbyn and accusing him of \u201cdefeat \u2026 shameful surrender \u2026 white flag \u2026 chlorinated chicken \u2026 shit or bust\u201d, and something rude about a girl\u2019s blouse.

The Search for Community in Postwar England. In it, Lawrence rescues dozens of voices from dusty transcripts buried in university libraries to build a picture of how British people have felt about their lives and the places they live in over many decades.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When government fails and basic needs go unmet, people turn in on themselves and try to look after their own as best they can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These are not vox pops. In successive studies people were interviewed at length, over many months, at work and at home, and encouraged to put across their side of the extraordinarily complex story of postwar society. What they reveal, unsurprisingly, is that people hate being told what to do: whether by family members, neighbours, bosses, colleagues or politicians.</p> <p>But at the same time they do want to feel supported. When government fails and basic needs go unmet, people turn in on themselves and try to look after their own as best they can. The idea that community is bolstered by character-building hardship is a myth. An unemployed Sheppey couple interviewed by the sociologist Ray Pahl in 1982 told him that when it was a struggle to maintain family life, it made you \u201csort of more narrow\u201d. In Lawrence\u2019s words, \u201cthe outside world ceased to matter when they were struggling to survive\u201d.</p> <p>Lawrence reminds us of what we should never forget: that to experience class at the \u201cwrong\u201d end of the scale \u2013 the economically difficult, culturally denigrated, politically marginalised end \u2013 is a constant struggle against visible and invisible forces. People\u2019s ambitions for themselves, their families and their neighbourhoods are vulnerable to attack from a combination of wilful inaction and deliberate destructiveness from government.</p> <p>It was undoubtedly resentment at such malign neglect over past decades that drove much of the Brexit vote in 2016, among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/26/uk-brexit-voters-mansfield-bristol-torbay-leeds-post-referendum\" title=\"\">traditionally Labour working-class communities</a> in the north of England and the Midlands.</p> <p>But the result has been a series of tired popular narratives about the role of place in forming our identity, the most common being the idea that certain places have been \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/17/britains-insecure-towns-left-behind\" title=\"\">left behind</a>\u201d \u2013 a term that conjures up a vision of areas filled with people who are bewildered and marooned in a changing world. Those places haven\u2019t been left behind, but deliberately held back. The people in them are desperate to vote for a party that is fundamentally optimistic about our ability to cope with change and knows what it has to do to make it possible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-labours-manifesto-a-bold-step\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s 2017 election manifesto</a> did this. It boosted the turnout and won the party over 40% of the vote. That will not stop the Conservatives attempting to mount a land-grab of supposedly \u201cleft-behind\u201d Brexit voters. (It was no accident that Boris Johnson chose Wakefield as the backdrop for his rambling speech yesterday.)</p> <p>A recent report by the right-leaning thinktank Onward entreated Tories to place more emphasis on \u201cthe politics of belonging\u201d, suggesting that \u201cvoters do not want more autonomy, choice and mobility. They want a government that \u2026 protects them, their families and British businesses from the modern world.\u201d</p> <p>Do they mean the same modern world in which the British use smartphones, social media and cashless payments more than anyone else? The problem is not modernity, or nostalgia for an idealised close-knit \u201ccommunity\u201d. People desperately want the feeling of autonomy, but are intelligent enough to recognise that autonomy isn\u2019t possible without an underpinning of material security. And they are not going to get that under the Tories, whatever guise the party takes under the shape-shifting Johnson, and whatever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/sajid-javid-promises-decade-renewal-sets-out-post-brexit-spending\" title=\"\">pre-election bungs</a> are cynically tossed their way by Sajid Javid.</p> <p>The Labour party too \u2013 and for a longer period of time \u2013 has been misreading the politics of community. When Ed Miliband was leader at the start of this decade he convened a lot of workshops and roundtables with advisers and MPs, asking: \u201cWhat should Labour conserve?\u201d In 2011 was invited to one of them, and I once got into a barney with two MPs who insisted that Miliband\u2019s emphasis on universal benefits would lose Labour \u201cthe white working class\u201d for ever if they felt that migrants and recent arrivals in communities were given equal treatment to longstanding residents. \u201cIt\u2019s about community, and social cohesion, and values,\u201d they blustered. What right had I to challenge the idea that the white working class \u2013 as they chose to define it \u2013 were right about all things at all times?</p> <p>Their approach was to paint Labour\u2019s problem as cultural \u2013 an inability to understand \u201chow the working class thinks\u201d \u2013 rather than one of policy. Labour spent decades accepting the policies that left deindustrialised England battered, bruised and angry. In the 1990s and 2000s it believed that if it spent enough money on welfare and education it would cover the cracks. When the cracks widened and working-class voters began to desert the party, they went for the \u201cculture\u201d explanation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/how-the-left-lost-the-fight-for-englishness\">How the left lost the fight for Englishness | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Successful community life is not about who chats to whom on the doorstep or about mystical working-class values.

In it, Lawrence rescues dozens of voices from dusty transcripts buried in university libraries to build a picture of how British people have felt about their lives and the places they live in over many decades. These are not vox pops. In successive studies people were interviewed at length, over many months, at work and at home, and encouraged to put across their side of the extraordinarily complex story of postwar society. What they reveal, unsurprisingly, is that people hate being told what to do: whether by family members, neighbours, bosses, colleagues or politicians. But at the same time they do want to feel supported. When government fails and basic needs go unmet, people turn in on themselves and try to look after their own as best they can. The idea that community is bolstered by character-building hardship is a myth. An unemployed Sheppey couple interviewed by the sociologist Ray Pahl in 1982 told him that when it was a struggle to maintain family life, it made you \u201csort of more narrow\u201d. In Lawrence\u2019s words, \u201cthe outside world ceased to matter when they were struggling to survive\u201d. Lawrence reminds us of what we should never forget: that to experience class at the \u201cwrong\u201d end of the scale \u2013 the economically difficult, culturally denigrated, politically marginalised end \u2013 is a constant struggle against visible and invisible forces. People\u2019s ambitions for themselves, their families and their neighbourhoods are vulnerable to attack from a combination of wilful inaction and deliberate destructiveness from government. It was undoubtedly resentment at such malign neglect over past decades that drove much of the Brexit vote in 2016, among traditionally Labour working-class communities in the north of England and the Midlands. But the result has been a series of tired popular narratives about the role of place in forming our identity, the most common being the idea that certain places have been \u201cleft behind\u201d \u2013 a term that conjures up a vision of areas filled with people who are bewildered and marooned in a changing world. Those places haven\u2019t been left behind, but deliberately held back. The people in them are desperate to vote for a party that is fundamentally optimistic about our ability to cope with change and knows what it has to do to make it possible. Labour\u2019s 2017 election manifesto did this. It boosted the turnout and won the party over 40% of the vote. That will not stop the Conservatives attempting to mount a land-grab of supposedly \u201cleft-behind\u201d Brexit voters. (It was no accident that Boris Johnson chose Wakefield as the backdrop for his rambling speech yesterday.) A recent report by the right-leaning thinktank Onward entreated Tories to place more emphasis on \u201cthe politics of belonging\u201d, suggesting that \u201cvoters do not want more autonomy, choice and mobility. They want a government that \u2026 protects them, their families and British businesses from the modern world.\u201d Do they mean the same modern world in which the British use smartphones, social media and cashless payments more than anyone else? The problem is not modernity, or nostalgia for an idealised close-knit \u201ccommunity\u201d. People desperately want the feeling of autonomy, but are intelligent enough to recognise that autonomy isn\u2019t possible without an underpinning of material security. And they are not going to get that under the Tories, whatever guise the party takes under the shape-shifting Johnson, and whatever pre-election bungs are cynically tossed their way by Sajid Javid. The Labour party too \u2013 and for a longer period of time \u2013 has been misreading the politics of community. When Ed Miliband was leader at the start of this decade he convened a lot of workshops and roundtables with advisers and MPs, asking: \u201cWhat should Labour conserve?\u201d In 2011 was invited to one of them, and I once got into a barney with two MPs who insisted that Miliband\u2019s emphasis on universal benefits would lose Labour \u201cthe white working class\u201d for ever if they felt that migrants and recent arrivals in communities were given equal treatment to longstanding residents. \u201cIt\u2019s about community, and social cohesion, and values,\u201d they blustered. What right had I to challenge the idea that the white working class \u2013 as they chose to define it \u2013 were right about all things at all times? Their approach was to paint Labour\u2019s problem as cultural \u2013 an inability to understand \u201chow the working class thinks\u201d \u2013 rather than one of policy. Labour spent decades accepting the policies that left deindustrialised England battered, bruised and angry. In the 1990s and 2000s it believed that if it spent enough money on welfare and education it would cover the cracks. When the cracks widened and working-class voters began to desert the party, they went for the \u201cculture\u201d explanation. Successful community life is not about who chats to whom on the doorstep or about mystical working-class values. It is about whether the essential needs of everyone in that community are met to the extent that they can look beyond that day\u2019s survival and outwards towards others. In Lawrence\u2019s wise words, \u201cthe task for politicians is to imagine the conditions which will enable people most fully to reconcile self and society in their daily lives\u201d. So when the Conservative party sends their representatives to court the working-class vote, they should be asked a few questions. Have they ever tried to apply for benefits to which they are entitled, or sought help from Citizens Advice? Have their local branch library and children\u2019s centre been closed? Have they ever tried to get a bus on a Sunday, or after 8pm, outside London? Have they noticed that children no longer play out on the street? Have they ever peeled \u201cFree Tommy Robinson\u201d stickers off the bus shelter and the playground gates? What did they feel on visiting any city centre and seeing the lines of destitute people trying to keep their tents pegged to the pavement and their sleeping bags clean? The very idea of a culture war, invoking supposed working-class values, is empty. What we are really talking about is quality of life. The problem of our times and our communities is that a full, rich life, free of avoidable stresses, in which the right to stay and the right to move are equally taken for granted, now feels so hard to achieve for so many people. \u2022 Lynsey Hanley is a writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide",

He sits beside me on a black metal railing as buses trundle by. \u201cAfter 35 years of darkness, there can be light,\u201d he says, referring to the 1985 riot that put the north London estate\u2019s name on the national media map. Few stories since, particularly after Duggan\u2019s death, have managed to redirect the violent narrative of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-broadwater-farm\" title=\"\">Broadwater Farm</a> in the public imagination. Yet Densu, 33, believes things can change.</p> <p>He speaks passionately of \u201ca unity among us. We\u2019re known as one of the most notorious estates in the UK. We want to change that. Through music, using the technology available to us, we\u2019re coming together to run a business.\u201d</p> <p>Arriving with Bandokay is Double Lz: the pair are members of OFB, AKA Original Farm Boys, one of the most talked-about drill acts, thanks to their unapologetically raw and dramatic collective style. Bandokay raps in quick, aggressive barks; Double Lz\u2019s voice is deep and pained. (The third member of the band, SJ, who shot to popularity with fans for his solo anthem Youngest in Charge is not around today.) \u201cEvery day it gets more crazy,\u201d Densu says, chuckling and shaking his head. He is talking about the messages he receives from artists wanting to collaborate and record label powerplayers keen to invest in OFB\u2019s ascent.</p> <p>Business is booming, then, but against the odds. \u201cI could give youngers jobs helping to run the camera team, social media, marketing. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re lacking in resources.\u201d Densu points across the road at hollowed-out shopfronts. \u201cThey were designed to house youth enterprises, but nothing round here has much value.\u201d He says a youth centre \u201cwould have been helpful as a place to organise and train young people who have nothing else to do here\u201d. A community centre was instead sold off to a private company and <a href=\"https://www.fusion-lifestyle.com/centres/broadwater-farm-community-centre/\" title=\"\">rebranded as a gym</a>, \u201cand the council aren\u2019t going to help us\u201d.</p> <p>UK drill music is characterised by a thumping, swinging bassline that sounds like the engine of a doubledecker bus; it is stitched together by tinny, marching-band snare drums and haunting piano or synth melodies. Since it took off in London, it has veered towards the fast-paced energy of grime, its wise old musical uncle, and away from its roots in Chicago drill and US trap. Unforgiving lyricism about the extremes of disfranchised, hypermasculine adolescent life \u2013 nihilistic references to knife violence (often in the form of provocation and bleak, detailed descriptions of drug dealing) \u2013 fills nearly every song.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSHRzhgDLRY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rSHRzhgDLRY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>OFB\u2019s Yoo.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Many people are concerned about the music\u2019s supposed capacity to entrench real-life violence.

His case raises questions about the ethics of violent music and the characters who make drill, and its ability to influence young minds.</p> <p>But amid a moral panic in the media, valid criticism has collapsed into censorship. In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/06/dont-censor-drill-music-listen-skengdo-am\" title=\"\">Skengdo and AM</a> were given suspended jail sentences for performing one of their songs; an unprecedented moment in British legal history. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/vb9b5d/digga-d-double-tap-diaries-interview-2019\" title=\"\">Digga D</a> has to submit lyrics to the police before releasing them. All three artists, as well as others, including another OFB affiliate RV and members of Brixton group 410, are forbidden from entering or even rapping about particular London postcodes. They have had their freedom squeezed by overwhelmed law enforcers eager to be seen to be doing something about violence among young people.</p> <p>Drill has received broadly negative attention since it was belatedly discovered by the mass media in 2018 \u2013 but it is also seeing increasing commercial success: artists such as DigDat, Russ and Digga D have reached the UK Top 20, and London-style drill instrumentals and vocal intonations are being employed by artists in Dublin, New York and Sydney. UK drill is part of a power shift in urban culture over the past decade, forged not by big record labels or radio stations but democratised technology and grassroots scenes.</p> <p>\u201cPeople know where I\u2019m coming from, and that what I\u2019m saying in my music is a reality for me,\u201d says Bandokay, who has his father\u2019s first name tattooed along the side of his left hand. Days before we meet, Bandokay and Double Lz, 18 and 17 respectively, returned from Ibiza, where they performed alongside their fellow Broadwater Farm native and drill breakout star Headie One, who Bandokay names as his most significant musical influence alongside the Brixton group 67 (\u201csix-seven\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cIt feels good, still,\u201d Double Lz says of their ascent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b565418e2ad1b0b3d027d35b66251cbf026961da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b565418e2ad1b0b3d027d35b66251cbf026961da/861_0_1660_996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A shot from the video Reality.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shot from the video Reality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get out the hood, and the easiest way of doing that is making music,\u201d says Bandokay. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of escaping gang life and achieving a better life. I wanna move my mum into a house. Music puts legal money into my account. No one helps us round here. So music is the only way.\u201d</p> <p>Bandokay says it was a \u201cfun, nice experience\u201d growing up on Broadwater Farm. Why does he want to escape, then? \u201cI wanna stop being harassed by police. Ever since they killed my dad, they have been on to me.\u201d In June, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7120365/DJ-Tim-Westwood-accused-glorifying-murder-appears-drill-rap-music-video.html\" title=\"\">the Daily Mail reported</a> that the DJ Tim Westwood \u2013 whom the publication has often used as a whipping boy for his influential role in the London music scene \u2013 was accused of glorifying murder by hosting a \u201cstreet gang\u201d on his YouTube freestyle platform. The piece mentioned Bandokay alongside his father\u2019s name in the headline. \u201cThey spoke about it like I\u2019m glamorising murders.\u201d</p> <p>Since late 2018 and the release of<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaoe0jvoTak\" title=\"\"> Bad B on the Nizz</a>, when they covered their faces in their videos like <a href=\"https://theface.com/music/bally-on-me-why-uk-rappers-cover-their-faces\" title=\"\">many young drill artists do to avoid being recognised by members of their communities and families, to thwart surveillance from police teams and stop prosecutors using videos as evidence in court</a>, OFB have soared to hood stardom. Like all drill collectives starting out, they garnered most of their popularity via crisply filmed music videos on YouTube, including<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOSzdrYGEE\" title=\"\"> Purge</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sguSSVDC11w\" title=\"\"> Reality</a>. Their first mixtape, Front Street, is out at Halloween. The group\u2019s steep upward trajectory shows how drill has become a source of empowerment and income for poor, black British teenage boys facing a vacuum of prospective career opportunities, unaddressed trauma from impoverished home lives and combat on the roads, and the daily ritual of disproportionate police attention.</p> <p>OFB\u2019s most acclaimed anthem is called<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QezMBY0Ndk\" title=\"\"> Ambush</a>, in which the three members go back-to-back in shortened bursts of bars, as if fighting for space over a pirate radio set. It has enabled them to stand out from the fiercely competitive, citywide ecosystem of drillers. \u201cNow, after that song, I\u2019m seeing everyone else come on that back-to-back ting,\u201d Bandokay says. \u201cBut it\u2019s calm because I understand that\u2019s the game \u2013 everyone learns off each other.\u201d</p> <p>In May, the song\u2019s video, filmed among the warren of walkways and car parks of Broadwater Farm, was removed from YouTube. It had been watched more than 2m times. This sort of obstacle became commonplace for drill artists, as the Metropolitan police pursued a vague crackdown on videos they deem to be inciting violence (this summer, YouTube announced it would no longer be deleting drill videos, but would continue to work with police to \u201ctake action when needed\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2acbce941e7e1150c01a05985b7e6dbfc500813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2acbce941e7e1150c01a05985b7e6dbfc500813/27_0_1802_1081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the video of Purge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the video of Purge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response, under Densu\u2019s guidance, OFB edited out any potentially provocative references to specific places, individuals and events before re-uploading the video. In July, with no warning or explanation, the group\u2019s own YouTube channel \u2013 a core infrastructural tool for any drill outfit trying to succeed in the industry \u2013 was deleted for a day before being reinstated.</p> <p>I ask the pair what they feel about drill\u2019s censorship. \u201cI do get where they\u2019re coming from, so man just has to lower it down, so everyone can vibe to it and there aren\u2019t any complaints,\u201d Bandokay replies. \u201cObviously, some things are going to provoke people. But it just depends on how people take it. Some people hear their name being called out, and they don\u2019t care. Some people may take it to the bottom of their heart.\u201d One of the main drivers of drill artists\u2019 popularity is their willingness to call out \u201copps\u201d, or rivals, entertaining fans tracing the music\u2019s social drama \u2013 and, to its critics, prompting potentially violent disputes. But like other experimenters making reformed iterations of the genre \u2013 dance-themed such as Russ\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nCoGjORGvg\" title=\"\">Gun Lean</a>, polished and playful such as Digga D\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEc2ZWIJKxc\" title=\"\">No Diet</a> or positive/spiritual, such as the church-cum-rap group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8age--6tJA\" title=\"\">Hope Dealers</a> (a drill collective who rap about being Christians) \u2013 OFB are keen to move away from that norm. \u201cWe\u2019re switching it up, doing clean music and trying to get to the better side of everything.\u201d</p> <p>This need to get to the \u201cbetter side\u201d is crucial. Some drill artists have been suspected and convicted of violent crimes. But it should not be assumed that the music is dangerous in and of itself; nor is its existence surprising as an undeniable expression of the truths of the artists\u2019 lives, if we acknowledge the dark conditions from which it stems.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon after I lost my dad, I started secondary school, but I got kicked out three months after because I couldn\u2019t control my behaviour</p> <footer> <cite>Bandokay</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The stories told in drill lyrics are often horrific: returning home filthy after spending a week dealing drugs in a faraway coastal town; cleaning your enemy\u2019s blood from your mum\u2019s kitchen knife with hot water and bleach; feeling scared and clumsy the first time you fire a gun; suspecting that the hard pillow of a prison cell bunk bed is giving you acne.

      "bodyText": "At the nucleus of the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London, is a road that local young people call Front Street. Words on a red love heart stuck inside one shop window read: \u201cJustice for Mark Duggan\u201d, referring to the 29-year-old who was shot dead by police in August 2011, prompting protests and then riots across English cities. Eight years on, Duggan\u2019s 18-year-old son, Kemani \u2013 trying to make it as a drill rapper under the moniker Bandokay \u2013 believes he is still dealing with the fallout. \u201cWhenever [the police] see me, they stop me,\u201d he says. \u201cI get what they\u2019re trying to do \u2013 they\u2019re trying to take weapons. But I know they purposely stop me more than anyone else. They know who I am. They know who my dad is. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to go through music and do something positive, so they don\u2019t have nothing to say about me.\u201d I wait to meet Duggan with his manager, Isaac Densu, who also grew up round here. He sits beside me on a black metal railing as buses trundle by. \u201cAfter 35 years of darkness, there can be light,\u201d he says, referring to the 1985 riot that put the north London estate\u2019s name on the national media map. Few stories since, particularly after Duggan\u2019s death, have managed to redirect the violent narrative of Broadwater Farm in the public imagination. Yet Densu, 33, believes things can change. He speaks passionately of \u201ca unity among us. We\u2019re known as one of the most notorious estates in the UK. We want to change that. Through music, using the technology available to us, we\u2019re coming together to run a business.\u201d Arriving with Bandokay is Double Lz: the pair are members of OFB, AKA Original Farm Boys, one of the most talked-about drill acts, thanks to their unapologetically raw and dramatic collective style. Bandokay raps in quick, aggressive barks; Double Lz\u2019s voice is deep and pained. (The third member of the band, SJ, who shot to popularity with fans for his solo anthem Youngest in Charge is not around today.) \u201cEvery day it gets more crazy,\u201d Densu says, chuckling and shaking his head. He is talking about the messages he receives from artists wanting to collaborate and record label powerplayers keen to invest in OFB\u2019s ascent. Business is booming, then, but against the odds. \u201cI could give youngers jobs helping to run the camera team, social media, marketing. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re lacking in resources.\u201d Densu points across the road at hollowed-out shopfronts. \u201cThey were designed to house youth enterprises, but nothing round here has much value.\u201d He says a youth centre \u201cwould have been helpful as a place to organise and train young people who have nothing else to do here\u201d. A community centre was instead sold off to a private company and rebranded as a gym, \u201cand the council aren\u2019t going to help us\u201d. UK drill music is characterised by a thumping, swinging bassline that sounds like the engine of a doubledecker bus; it is stitched together by tinny, marching-band snare drums and haunting piano or synth melodies. Since it took off in London, it has veered towards the fast-paced energy of grime, its wise old musical uncle, and away from its roots in Chicago drill and US trap. Unforgiving lyricism about the extremes of disfranchised, hypermasculine adolescent life \u2013 nihilistic references to knife violence (often in the form of provocation and bleak, detailed descriptions of drug dealing) \u2013 fills nearly every song. Many people are concerned about the music\u2019s supposed capacity to entrench real-life violence. UK drill\u2019s 19-year-old former poster boy Unknown T \u2013 real name Daniel Lena \u2013 has been charged with the murder of 20-year-old Steven Narvaez-Jara. His case raises questions about the ethics of violent music and the characters who make drill, and its ability to influence young minds. But amid a moral panic in the media, valid criticism has collapsed into censorship. In February, Skengdo and AM were given suspended jail sentences for performing one of their songs; an unprecedented moment in British legal history. Digga D has to submit lyrics to the police before releasing them. All three artists, as well as others, including another OFB affiliate RV and members of Brixton group 410, are forbidden from entering or even rapping about particular London postcodes. They have had their freedom squeezed by overwhelmed law enforcers eager to be seen to be doing something about violence among young people. Drill has received broadly negative attention since it was belatedly discovered by the mass media in 2018 \u2013 but it is also seeing increasing commercial success: artists such as DigDat, Russ and Digga D have reached the UK Top 20, and London-style drill instrumentals and vocal intonations are being employed by artists in Dublin, New York and Sydney. UK drill is part of a power shift in urban culture over the past decade, forged not by big record labels or radio stations but democratised technology and grassroots scenes. \u201cPeople know where I\u2019m coming from, and that what I\u2019m saying in my music is a reality for me,\u201d says Bandokay, who has his father\u2019s first name tattooed along the side of his left hand. Days before we meet, Bandokay and Double Lz, 18 and 17 respectively, returned from Ibiza, where they performed alongside their fellow Broadwater Farm native and drill breakout star Headie One, who Bandokay names as his most significant musical influence alongside the Brixton group 67 (\u201csix-seven\u201d). \u201cIt feels good, still,\u201d Double Lz says of their ascent. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get out the hood, and the easiest way of doing that is making music,\u201d says Bandokay. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of escaping gang life and achieving a better life. I wanna move my mum into a house. Music puts legal money into my account. No one helps us round here. So music is the only way.\u201d Bandokay says it was a \u201cfun, nice experience\u201d growing up on Broadwater Farm. Why does he want to escape, then? \u201cI wanna stop being harassed by police. Ever since they killed my dad, they have been on to me.\u201d In June, the Daily Mail reported that the DJ Tim Westwood \u2013 whom the publication has often used as a whipping boy for his influential role in the London music scene \u2013 was accused of glorifying murder by hosting a \u201cstreet gang\u201d on his YouTube freestyle platform. The piece mentioned Bandokay alongside his father\u2019s name in the headline. \u201cThey spoke about it like I\u2019m glamorising murders.\u201d Since late 2018 and the release of Bad B on the Nizz, when they covered their faces in their videos like many young drill artists do to avoid being recognised by members of their communities and families, to thwart surveillance from police teams and stop prosecutors using videos as evidence in court, OFB have soared to hood stardom. Like all drill collectives starting out, they garnered most of their popularity via crisply filmed music videos on YouTube, including Purge and Reality. Their first mixtape, Front Street, is out at Halloween. The group\u2019s steep upward trajectory shows how drill has become a source of empowerment and income for poor, black British teenage boys facing a vacuum of prospective career opportunities, unaddressed trauma from impoverished home lives and combat on the roads, and the daily ritual of disproportionate police attention. OFB\u2019s most acclaimed anthem is called Ambush, in which the three members go back-to-back in shortened bursts of bars, as if fighting for space over a pirate radio set. It has enabled them to stand out from the fiercely competitive, citywide ecosystem of drillers. \u201cNow, after that song, I\u2019m seeing everyone else come on that back-to-back ting,\u201d Bandokay says. \u201cBut it\u2019s calm because I understand that\u2019s the game \u2013 everyone learns off each other.\u201d In May, the song\u2019s video, filmed among the warren of walkways and car parks of Broadwater Farm, was removed from YouTube. It had been watched more than 2m times. This sort of obstacle became commonplace for drill artists, as the Metropolitan police pursued a vague crackdown on videos they deem to be inciting violence (this summer, YouTube announced it would no longer be deleting drill videos, but would continue to work with police to \u201ctake action when needed\u201d). In response, under Densu\u2019s guidance, OFB edited out any potentially provocative references to specific places, individuals and events before re-uploading the video. In July, with no warning or explanation, the group\u2019s own YouTube channel \u2013 a core infrastructural tool for any drill outfit trying to succeed in the industry \u2013 was deleted for a day before being reinstated. I ask the pair what they feel about drill\u2019s censorship. \u201cI do get where they\u2019re coming from, so man just has to lower it down, so everyone can vibe to it and there aren\u2019t any complaints,\u201d Bandokay replies. \u201cObviously, some things are going to provoke people. But it just depends on how people take it. Some people hear their name being called out, and they don\u2019t care. Some people may take it to the bottom of their heart.\u201d One of the main drivers of drill artists\u2019 popularity is their willingness to call out \u201copps\u201d, or rivals, entertaining fans tracing the music\u2019s social drama \u2013 and, to its critics, prompting potentially violent disputes. But like other experimenters making reformed iterations of the genre \u2013 dance-themed such as Russ\u2019s Gun Lean, polished and playful such as Digga D\u2019s No Diet or positive/spiritual, such as the church-cum-rap group Hope Dealers (a drill collective who rap about being Christians) \u2013 OFB are keen to move away from that norm. \u201cWe\u2019re switching it up, doing clean music and trying to get to the better side of everything.\u201d This need to get to the \u201cbetter side\u201d is crucial. Some drill artists have been suspected and convicted of violent crimes. But it should not be assumed that the music is dangerous in and of itself; nor is its existence surprising as an undeniable expression of the truths of the artists\u2019 lives, if we acknowledge the dark conditions from which it stems. The stories told in drill lyrics are often horrific: returning home filthy after spending a week dealing drugs in a faraway coastal town; cleaning your enemy\u2019s blood from your mum\u2019s kitchen knife with hot water and bleach; feeling scared and clumsy the first time you fire a gun; suspecting that the hard pillow of a prison cell bunk bed is giving you acne. But they are also exactly what makes the music so rich as a cultural resource that ought to be mined, not shunned or demonised by educators and policymakers. Drill is a uniquely clear window through which to see where cities and youth culture are heading in austerity Britain, where council and state school budgets, police forces, and youth services have been slashed. When more than 4.5 million children live in poverty, the temptation for teenagers of getting quick money in the illicit drug economy is stronger than ever, and exploitative \u201ccounty lines\u201d networks are leaving vulnerable young people and their families devastated. School exclusions have risen, leading to the oversubscription of pupil referral units (PRUs) and other alternative provisions, which already struggle to intercept the conveyor belt to prison. These forces are churning out disengaged young people \u2013 disproportionately boys of colour \u2013 who have little hope for a bright future, despite living in the fifth largest economy in the world. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to experience school like normal people,\u201d Bandokay says. \u201cSoon after I lost my dad, I started secondary school, but I got kicked out three months after because I couldn\u2019t control my behaviour.\u201d He subsequently attended several PRUs and spent little time in a consistent educational setting. I ask if he ever felt properly supported by any services throughout this period, and he shakes his head. As a youth worker, I have met countless boys who have experienced similar patterns of derailment from a young age and who therefore struggle to meet the pressurising demands of their pastorally underresourced, exams-focused academy schools. \u201cI\u2019m still smart, though \u2026 don\u2019t get it twisted!\u201d Bandokay adds with a smirk. Does the pair understand why people show concern about drill lyrics? \u201cPeople who are not used to listening to this type of music think we are talking mad,\u201d Bandokay says. \u201cBut if you actually know me, and know what I\u2019ve been through, then you know where I\u2019m coming from, and you\u2019ll be proud of me.\u201d He looks up over my shoulder to acknowledge the arrival of his uncle, Marlon Duggan \u2013 Mark\u2019s younger brother \u2013 who takes a seat on the wall next to me. \u201cPeople who understand this music, like my uncle, are proud of me. If it wasn\u2019t for music, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d be doing. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d be earning my money. It\u2019s keeping me out of jail. I thank God things are changing, you feel me?\u201d I say my goodbyes and stand up to leave, passing a group of men flicking pound coins on to the ground, trying to land them close to a brick wall. Densu leads me out. \u201cA positive story can come out of this,\u201d he says, picking up his phone \u2013 probably someone making an inquiry about OFB.",

      "bodyText": "Refugees who were previously detained on Manus or Nauru but are now in Australia can apply for US resettlement. The \u201csignificant\u201d shift, which was revealed in an immigration document, suggests the US could eventually reach its 1,250 cap on cases. It comes as Papua New Guinea authorities move all but 15 refugees from Manus Island to the capital, Port Moresby. In an information notice from the US refugee admissions program (USRAP), the US government has said it plans to finish all initial interviews with refugees on Nauru and Manus Island by 20 December. \u201cIf you are currently residing in Nauru, Papua New Guinea or Australia and believe you are eligible for the USRAP, but have not engaged in the process, you must confirm your intention to initiate an application by September 20, 2019 by notifying your designated Status Resolution Officer,\u201d it said. Anyone who has has placed their application on hold also has until 20 September to notify the USRAP. The apparent softening of the rules appears to present US resettlement as an option for the first time to the estimated 1,000 people currently in Australia from Manus or Nauru for medical treatment or accompanying a family member getting medical treatment. Amnesty International Australia\u2019s Graham Thom described the shift presented by the USRAP document as a significant \u201cgame changer\u201d. \u201cFrom Amnesty International\u2019s perspective, these people are Australia\u2019s responsibility and they should be allowed to stay here, but the reality is the 1,000 or so here are in limbo,\u201d said Thom. \u201cThis gives them an opportunity for permanent protection \u2026 For them it\u2019s a very real chance at a new future.\u201d Previously USRAP applicants had to follow strict requirements, including flying from Manus Island to Port Moresby for interviews and back again, even if they wanted to stay in Port Moresby. Families on Nauru also reported that they were not able to apply collectively unless they were all in attendance, even if some were in Australia for medical care. In 2016, the Australian government struck a deal with the Obama administration for the US to resettle up to 1250 refugees who were sent to Manus Island and Nauru by Australia under its offshore processing regime. One of the deal\u2019s architects, former assistant secretary of state Anne Richard, last year told Guardian Australia it was offered in the hope Australia would \u201cdo more\u201d to help refugees generally, and because of US concerns about the conditions in the detention centres. The process has been slow, causing concern among refugees, and prompting speculation from the Australian government that the US was unlikely to reach its offered cap of 1,250. However Thom said the document suggested they might still be aiming to get there. \u201cIt\u2019s very responsible from the US and showing a lot of good faith, at a time when they are drastically cutting back their resettlement program.\u201d As of 22 August, just 619 refugees had been resettled in the US, including 330 from Nauru and 279 from Papua New Guinea. Another 10 people have been moved to the US from Australia, but they are understood to have gone through the assessment process while in offshore settings, before coming to Australia for medical care. Guardian Australia understands there are fewer than 10 men in PNG who are going through the assessment process for US resettlement, and about 90 who have been approved but are still waiting in Port Moresby to leave. The PNG government has moved nearly all the remaining asylum seekers and refugees from Manus Island to Port Moresby. About 15 remained on the island on Friday, after three transfers \u2013 of 35, 42, and 12 people in the past two weeks. The transfers were announced by the PNG government as a voluntary option, but at least some of the group were relocated without consultation. Once in Port Moresby, they have been told they\u2019ll be given accommodation, a weekly allowance, and access to healthcare and assistance in finding work.\u2019 \u201cRelocation to Port Moresby is not permanent settlement in PNG,\u201d PNG\u2019s Immigration and Citizenship Authority said. \u201cThe ICA continues to encourage refugees to consider settling in PNG.\u201d Refugees in Port Moresby are spread across a number of hotels. Those receiving medical care are at the Granville, under guard but with some freedom of movement. Another group is at the Citi Boutique but has been subject to restrictions including being allowed out for just two hours every second day. Those at the Lodge 10 hotel have mostly been accepted for US resettlement and are going through final medical checks and waiting for departure arrangements. Another 53 men are believed to still be in the immigration detention centre annexed to the Bomana Prison, detained as unlawful non-citizens. They have been determined not to be refugees, but about half were never assessed, having refused to take part in the process several years ago. The Australian and US governments have been contacted for comment.",

Abbott said dying populations, not climate change, were the biggest threat to western civilisation, and lashed out at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for recent remarks that they would not have more than two children due to the effects on the environment. \u201cHaving fewer children in western countries will hardly make the climate better when so many children are being born elsewhere,\u201d said Abbott. A fear of rising populations in other parts of the world was the dominant theme during the opening morning of the Budapest summit, despite the presence of delegations from many developing countries. The tone was set by an artistic performance that opened the forum, portraying hordes of people from the south and east advancing on Europe. \u201cEurope has become the continent of the empty crib whereas in Asia and Africa they face demographic challenges of the opposite type,\u201d said Katalin Nov\u00e1k, Hungary\u2019s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs. The two-day summit was also attended by Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, and Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, who both said boosting birthrates was a priority for the long-term development of their countries. Vu\u010di\u0107 said his country was losing the equivalent of the population of a medium-sized town each year. \u201cSerbian people have one expression for negative population growth: the white plague,\u201d he said. Nov\u00e1k, in previous written responses to questions from the Guardian, said the Hungarian government doubled family spending between 2010 and 2019, with the goal of achieving \u201ca lasting turn in demographic processes by 2030\u201d. Fertility rates have gone up from 1.2 to 1.5 children per woman, according to government figures. This is still far from the 2.1 figure the UN says is the number required for a sustainable population. Governments across central Europe have introduced financial incentives for having children, with Poland introducing the 500+ scheme, which pays parents 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a3103) a month per child from the second child onwards. The Polish scheme was extended in July this year to cover every child, including the first one, without any income threshold. Babi\u0161 said the Czech Republic also wanted to encourage big families. \u201cIt is the third child which is of key importance \u2026 We do not wish to bribe anyone to have a third child, but we must provide support primarily to families who voluntarily undertake the third child,\u201d he said. This year the Hungarian government introduced a 10m forint (\u00a327,000) interest-free loan for families, which does not have to be paid back if the couple has three children. Nov\u00e1k denied that this could put pressure on women to have children: \u201cContrary to the unjustified and politically motivated accusations, we do not want to force anyone to have children \u2026 It\u2019s shocking that we are constantly attacked for trying to support families by all means available.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2019 to add that the Polish 500+ scheme was extended in July this year to cover every child, including the first one and to correct a reference in a quote from Serbia\u2019s president Vu\u010di\u0107 which we misrendered as \u201cwhite flag\u201d when \u201cwhite plague\u201d was meant.",

But the highest ranked teenager on the tour found a vein of form as her opponent came apart, keeping Bencic off rhythm with a clever mix of angles, slices, high balls and drop shots and breaking three times as many return games to close the show. \u201cIt was just here and there, some stupid mistakes from my side, good shots from her side, some lines, some net cords,\u201d said Bencic, who will return to the top 10 in next week\u2019s rankings after a 43-month absence. \u201cTennis is very fast. Things turn around very fast. Unfortunately for me today was the other way.\u201d After she pounded a crisp return into the corner on match point that Bencic could scarcely get a racquet on, Andreescu stood on the baseline with an expression of disbelief. \u201cA lot of emotions are running through my body right now,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully I can just keep the momentum going for the finals. Hopefully I can play a little bit better than I did today.\u201d",

The creatures are thought to be from Indonesia, which would mean navigating the busy Malacca Strait, a 550-mile-long (900km) stretch of water between Malaysia and Indonesia that is only a few kilometres wide at its narrowest point. Fishermen working in the strait have reported seeing \u201csnouts in the dark\u201d in coastal waters each night, though the animals may also have been stowaways on shipping. The wild boar are using island of Besar as a landing point before crossing into the Malaysian mainland and other coastal areas. \u201cThe mystical island of Pulau Besar here has witnessed widespread damage from the \u2018migration\u2019 of dozens of these wild boars, including piglets,\u201d said Baktee. Pulau Besar, which according to its namesake means \u201cbig island\u201d, is a sleepy tropical island located about nine miles off the Malaysian coast, across from the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Given the recent influx of wild boar the agriculture committee said it was concerned the migrant pigs might soon outnumber the island\u2019s small human population. The department of wildlife, known as Perhilitan, in the Malaysian state of Malacca, has reportedly agreed to deploy staff to shoot the animals, said Baktee. \u201cPerhilitan is bringing in three sharpshooters on a mission to save Pulau Besar from the wild boar invasion,\u201d he said. Pulau Besar has long held a place in the imagination of mystics, spiritualists and pilgrims. It is said to be home to the graves of several people who first brought Islam to the Malay archipelago in the 14th century. Other tourist draws include a mystical cave where warriors were said to once practise traditional martial arts, a mythical well and a large boulder believed to grant wishes. Last year the state government pledged to rebrand the island as a tourist resort and free trade zone in an effort to eliminate \u201csuperstitious and sacred activities\u201d and promote local products, such as cocoa.",

      "bodyText": "The Department of Human Services has for the second time wiped the debt at the centre of a legal challenge to the controversial robodebt scheme, the federal court has heard. But the challenge will go to trial in December after lawyers for the commonwealth told the court they were happy for the case to go ahead. Brought by Victoria Legal Aid on behalf of Deanna Amato, 33, the case is an attempt to test the legality of the robodebt scheme, which has faced sustained criticism and is the subject of two Senate inquiries. Amato had her $1,700 tax return garnisheed over the alleged $2,754 robodebt, but the court heard on Friday that the Department of Human Services had recalculated the debt to an \u201camount below two dollars\u201d. The commonwealth subsequently repaid the money to Amato but is refusing to pay interest. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I don\u2019t have a big debt looming over me anymore but, on the other hand, I\u2019m stunned that it was recalculated so easily after I took legal action,\u201d Amato said after Friday\u2019s hearing. \u201cCentrelink will make you jump through hoops to prove your innocence, but it turns out they were capable of finding out if my reporting was correct and that I didn\u2019t owe them anything like what the robodebt claimed I owed. \u201cIt makes me question the system even more.\u201d Legal Aid brought the case on behalf of Amato after the department wiped the $4,000 debt owed by a Melbourne nurse, Madeleine Masterton, before arguing the case should no longer proceed. The non-existence of a debt allows the department to argue there is no \u201cutility\u201d in the case, as it did in the Masterton challenge. But the commonwealth said it would not pursue this argument for a second time. The commonwealth\u2019s lawyer, Nicholas Owens SC, told the court on Friday that the commonwealth supported the case going ahead. He said there was an existing dispute about Amato\u2019s demand that the commonwealth pay her interest on the money it had returned to her, which it was opposed to. Amato\u2019s lawyer, Peter Hanks QC, said it would have been \u201cunfair to allow the commonwealth to \u2026 pick off the Amato proceeding on the same grounds\u201d as the Masterton case. He also refused to withdraw an allegation that the commonwealth had acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d by wiping Masterton\u2019s debt in the first case. The case will go to trial in early December before Justice Jennifer Davies. A leaked draft cabinet submission prepared by the Department of Human Services for the government services minister, Stuart Robert, revealed last month that the department was recalculating the debt in Amato. \u201cThe debt in Amato is under further review and may also be recalculated,\u201d said the documents leaked to Guardian Australia. After the first debt was waived, Hanks, who also acted for Masterton, said the department had a \u201cforensic advantage\u201d because it could wipe the debt and then say it had no case to answer. The department said it had recalculated the debt after receiving new information from Masterton in the process of preparing for the case. Legal Aid says the case hinges on the legality of the process itself, not the merits of the debt calculation.",

      "bodyText": "In 2013 the American trans journalist Daniel Mallory Ortberg co-founded the feminist website The Toast. Today he writes Slate\u2019s Dear Prudence advice column, hosts the Dear Prudence podcast, and is the author of the New York Times bestselling book Texts from Jane Eyre: and Other Conversations with Your Favourite Literary Characters (2014). Guardian Australia spoke to him as he touched down in Australia for the Melbourne Writers Festival. You are appearing in a panel on teenage heartthrobs. Tell us more! You can absolutely expect long discourse conversations about how it was impossible to tell the difference about a guy who had floppy hair and your soulmate in the 90s. That might be the bulk of the conversation. The Melbourne Writers Festival is also hosting a live Dear Prudence session ... It will be my first international show, my first time tackling Australian problems. It\u2019s a lot like the podcast. There tends to be a little more vamping; there tends to be a little bit more me telling everybody how to live their lives. Then there are questions from the audience. There have been nights where it has been fun and a little boisterous; then there have been nights where we have gone very deep into intergenerational trauma. Have your live shows ever got out of control? The last time I did a Dear Prudence live show it got very intense \u2013 I think I needed a week to just go home and sleep and recover. We actually ended up stopping the recording. It was the sort of thing where people were talking about ongoing issues with family members, people who had committed abuse to them in the past. It\u2019s the conversation you do not necessarily want to have on record on a podcast. What is the Dear Prudence problem that has most stayed with you? A couple of years ago I heard from a woman who said: \u201cI recently bought my boyfriend a bidet and he stopped buying toilet paper.\u201d In your book published last year, The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror, you rewrite classic fairytales, including switching around gender roles. There is both a lot of gender in that book and in some ways very little gender. It wasn\u2019t so much I wanted to say I could create this space where gender doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 it is just unfamiliar configurations. I wanted to write about the experience of being prodded or feeling that you\u2019re disappointed or being pushed into something, a lot of things that both trans and non-trans people can experience. It just felt like gender from different directions, not more or less than we have now. Just before releasing The Merry Spinster, you came out as trans. Did writing the book help? I know now that writing fiction is not a good alternative to dealing with your own feelings about your gender! It just ended up becoming two very different prospects. But I got to feel imaginative in ways that feel exciting. I got to come up with a lot of really exciting painful ideas. Both your parents are Christian ministers. What is your relationship to religion? Ongoing and complicated I guess are some of the best ways to start describing it. I\u2019ve had a lot of different relationships with religion over the course of my life: you name it, I\u2019ve had it. I now feel it\u2019s pretty much just a part of me, just a part of who I am, a part of how I think about the world, how I grew up, how I relate to things like community or desire or change. How did coming out as trans affect your parents? Lots of it was surprising in the sense I had gone into it with the expectation that I might lose my family. They wanted to know me; they wanted to be there for me. And I think oftentimes with trans people, when we come out as trans it\u2019s not our first coming out \u2013 we\u2019ve done one or two trial runs before.

Jurors were \u201chopelessly deadlocked\u201d in the case against Derick Almena, 49, who illegally rented out the space and developed it as an artists\u2019 commune, said the superior court judge Trina Thompson on Thursday. \u201cI must declare a mistrial.\u201d Almena had faced up to 39 years in prison over the 2 December 2016 fire. Max Harris, 29, Almena\u2019s purported right-hand man, was found not guilty on all charges. Authorities said that Almena ignored fire codes and warnings that the space was hazardous when he illegally converted it to living quarters. He filled the building with Balinese statues, antiques, discarded material and wooden pallets, racking up a history of violations and complaints. Prosecutors alleged the two men knowingly packed dozens of people into \u201ca fire trap\u201d the night of the blaze. That night, the warehouse was the location of an electronic music party that Harris had helped to plan. Almena often hosted for-profit concerts at the commune, even though it was not licensed for entertainment. Almena \u2013 who lived in the warehouse with his family \u2013 became the object of ire in the wake of the fire after after he posted on Facebook, just hours after the flames broke out: \u201cEverything I worked so hard for is gone.

Almena and Harris had both pleaded no contest to the charges as part of a plea deal, but a judge rejected the deal after he ruled that Almena had not shown sufficient remorse during the sentencing hearing. The Ghost Ship disaster was one of the deadliest structure fires in US history and dealt a devastating blow to the Bay Area\u2019s underground arts and music scene. Many of the those who died that night came from within the community, including musicians, artists, students, creatives, teachers and photographers. The tragedy brought into focus the harsh reality of the housing crisis, and the hazardous conditions it was forcing local artists to accept in order to continue living and working in the Bay Area. Following the fire, some were evicted from similar spaces. Attorneys for Harris and Almena attempted to turn the blame on the city of Oakland, arguing that officials responding to complaints could better spot potential fire hazards than a warehouse of artists. Thursday\u2019s announcement followed months of court proceedings, which were prolonged when the judge replaced three of the jurors with alternates and ordered deliberations begin anew. Victims and family members crowded into a hot hallway inside an Oakland courthouse, where they waited to enter the courtroom where the verdict would be read. The courtroom filled quickly and dozens of onlookers were turned away. After nearly an hour, Curtis Briggs, an attorney representing Harris, emerged from the courtroom and sighed as he hugged another member of the legal team. In a statement to the press after the verdict had been announced, Briggs and other lawyers for the defendants criticized city officials for failing to tackle the lack of affordable housing. Oakland needed to use this opportunity to \u201cclean house\u201d, said Briggs, who added that no officials took responsibility for the lack of oversight when it came to building inspections and violations. \u201cNone of this ever would have happened in the first place if the income inequality \u2026 and the housing crisis weren\u2019t as bad and wasn\u2019t permitted to get as bad in the Bay Area and in Oakland,\u201d said Taylor Smith, another attorney for Harris. \u201cThese artists were living in this warehouse because they didn\u2019t have too many other options.

Even by Johnson\u2019s standards, it was rambling and shambolic. The only rational explanation I can think for what happened is that it is all part of some ultra-cunning plan to convince Jeremy Corbyn that he can vote for an election because Johnson will be such a hopeless campaigner, but life normally doesn\u2019t work like that. If it looks like a cock-up, it probably is a cock-up.</p> \n  <p>First, the backdrop was pure Donald Trump. Although ostensibly an event to promote the government\u2019s police recruitment plans, this was obviously a party political event - No 10 described it this morning as day one of the election campaign - and so there was something clearly improper about getting the police to act as extras on set. And if you do want to present yourself as a politician committed to supporting the police, it is best not to force them to stand in the sun for so long (Johnson started about an hour late) that they start dropping like flies. </p> \n  <p>If you do invite people to listen to a speech and then force them to wait, you should at least prepare something of merit to say. But Johnson wasn\u2019t speaking from a script, and he appeared to have given very little thought to what he wanted to say about policing (beyond a threadbare argument about policing being at the heart of a successful economy). At one point he launched into a very bizarre routine about the police caution; quite what that was all about remains a mystery. Of course, sounding improvised is part of the Johnson schtick - in his Churchill biography he quotes approvingly the FE Smith line that Churchill \u201cspent the best years of his life preparing his impromptu remarks\u201d; Johnson has mastered the same trick himself - but today this did not sound like artful spontaneity. To be honest, it sounded like he had had a glass too many at lunchtime.</p> \n  <p>On Monday Johnson stood outside Number 10 and said he did not want an election. Today\u2019s message was all about taunting/shaming Corbyn into agreeing one. Even someone as practiced at inconsistency as Johnson would find this hard to pull off, and in the office where I was watching his insincerity seemed obvious - although perhaps outside the \u201cbubble\u201d people may be willing to credit his claim that he doesn\u2019t really want an election at all.</p> \n  <p>To his credit, Johnson did take a large number of questions. His most interesting line was his assertion that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than request an article 50 extension in October, as he might be obliged to by a bill becoming law on Monday. That did not sound literally true either, but at least that was a hyperbole untruth, not a statement of bad faith. Perhaps leave voters, and the wider group of voters who just want the Brexit crisis saga to end, will cheer this message. But whether that compensates for the overall impression of omnishambles is another matter.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7139ea8f082514879ee994\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T16:41:21.411Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Corbyn says he cannot trust you to have an election before the EU summit in October?</em></p> \n  <p>Johnson claims this is a new charge.</p> \n  <p>He says he wants an election on 15 October. \u201cEarlier if he wants ... let\u2019s crack on with it.\u201d He says he does not see how the UK\u2019s negotiating position can be torpedoed.</p> \n  <p>One of the police officers standing behind Johnson has just stood down.

What we\u2019re not prepared to do is sign up to a general election until we are as certain as we possibly can be that this prime minister would not subvert any agreement and still try to find a way to take the UK out of the EU without a deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed the idea that during the next general election Welsh Labour should forge pacts with other parties to counter a possible Tory/Brexit Party alliance. </strong>He said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m instinctively not attracted to them [pacts]. I think it is better than the democratic choices lie in the hands of the voters rather than in deals between parties.

But he said the position was \u201cinherently volatile\u201d. He said the \u201csmallest changes\u201d could lead to traffic jams stretching off the island on to the north Wales mainland.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He stressed that Welsh Labour was a party of remain, even though Wales overall voted leave.</strong> He said: <br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will will continue to argue that Wales\u2019 best interests are best protected by continued membership of the EU.

All three were circulated inside Number 10, including to Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, and Ed Lister, his chief of staff, but no cabinet minister other than Johnson.</p> \n  <p>The first on 15 August from Da Costa setting out their prorogation strategy was ticked by Johnson, with his scribbled note \u201cyes\u201d. He replied the next day with a handwritten note which said: \u201cwhole September session [at Westminster] is a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs are earning their crust. I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this prorogation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The UK government said they were blacked out because the censored parts were not relevant or protected by \u201clegal professional privilege\u201d. Andrew Webster QC, for the UK government, told the court it was essential to keep them confidential to preserve cabinet confidentiality.</p> \n  <p>In what O\u2019Neill described as a snub to the Scottish courts, they were not given to the court of session as primary pieces of evidence backed up as affidavits, but were released only because they were being submitted as evidence to the parallel Gina Miller case in London, which started today.</p> \n  <p>Kenny McBrearty QC, appearing for the BBC and News UK, said it was in the public interest and in the interests of open justice for those memos to be published in full. If Number 10 had decided it was appropriate it was to give them to the court, where they were read out in part by O\u2019Neill on Tuesday, then clearly they were not totally confidential. </p> \n  <p>O\u2019Neill has made a separate submission to the three judges, arguing the documents could only be redacted by the court. Downing Street could not unilaterally decide which sections to release, without proper scrutiny. Downing Street had also chosen not to apply for a public interest immunity (PII) certificate \u2013 an orthodox route to keep key documents secret.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T12:19:25.433Z\">at 1.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70f9ca8f0891025b4485bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T12:06:42.909Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Asked about Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation at business questions, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said MPs were used to the idea that people within families might disagree on policy.

I respect their position. But I know from meetings I have had with local members that many are as dismayed as me by the course of negotiations and about the actual choice now on offer. Two-and-a-half years on, the practical Brexit options are now clear and the public should be asked to choose between the different paths facing our country: we will all have different positions on that choice, but I think many in my local party, in the Orpington constituency and around the country would welcome having the last word on the government\u2019s Brexit proposals.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T11:03:49.288Z\">at 12.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70e84e8f08b2e15bc1ab9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T10:50:44.826Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from <strong>Robin Niblett</strong>, director of the Chatham House thinktank</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinNiblett/status/1169561719255031811\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Having heard Jo Johnson speak eloquently and passionately in the recent past about the need for the UK to have a close and effective long-term relationship with the EU, this seems like a logical decision.

The easiest way for the PM to hold an early election would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for one (the threshold set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act), but this would require opposition support. An alternative approach would be to legislate to amend the FTPA, but even though this would require just a simple majority, Boris Johnson does not have one at the moment, meaning this route would also require opposition cooperation.</p> \n  <p>At the start of this week Labour faced at least four possible options.</p> \n  <p>1) Agree an election immediately.</p> \n  <p>2) Agree an election once the Benn bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October becomes law, which is now due to happen next Monday.</p> \n  <p>3) Agree an election once the Benn bill has become law, and Johnson has provided some cast-iron assurance as to when the date will be.</p> \n  <p>4) Agree an election only after the EU has agreed to extend article 50 beyond the end of October. Assuming the PM did not agree a Brexit deal beforehand (which currently seems unlikely), this means that Labour would not vote for an early election until after 19 October, the deadline in the Benn bill for an article 50 request. The election would then take place in November at the earliest.</p> \n  <p>Labour ruled out 1). But, in the debate last night, <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> implied that 2) was his position. He told Johnson: \u201cLet [the Benn bill] pass and gain royal assent, and then we will back an election.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But many in the Labour party want the party to wait much longer. And in his interview McDonnell confirmed that the party was considering a delay. He said the party was worried about Johnson trying to change the date.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The problem that we had is that we couldn\u2019t determine the date of the election. Of course, Boris Johnson might come along say\u201d \u2018I promise you it will be such and such a date.\u2019 But he\u2019s not renowned ... for delivering on what he says ... We can\u2019t trust him. It\u2019s not just me; it\u2019s his own side.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McDonnell said Labour was consulting on how a bill to amend the FTPA could be used to fix the date of a general election. A bill could set 15 October as the date for the election. But McDonnell also said there was a case for holding it later, after the EU summit in October. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The problem that we\u2019ve got is that we cannot at the moment have any confidence in Boris Johnson abiding by any commitment or deal that we could construct. That\u2019s the truth of it. So we\u2019re now consulting about whether it\u2019s better to go long, therefore, rather than to go short. And that decision will be taken.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although McDonnell did not acknowledge it, another advantage for Labour in delaying the election until November is that, if Brexit had to be delayed, the Conservatives would get hammered by the Brexit party.</p> \n  <p>Despite what Corbyn said in the debate last night, the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong> says Corbyn is saying in private that he is going to wait.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1169365639103991809\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A senior Labour MP has just said Jeremy Corbyn told him tonight he would NOT allow Boris Johnson to have an election before 31st October</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1169365639103991809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 4, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01731fc0c07614db38a94a97ca419db47ae9f835\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01731fc0c07614db38a94a97ca419db47ae9f835/0_107_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T09:22:57.479Z\">at 10.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70c5378f08b2e15bc1aa05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T08:21:16.884Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d69135022fba1c7153be81cacb7374b2385b85\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d69135022fba1c7153be81cacb7374b2385b85/0_64_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shami Chakrabarti (centre), the shadow attorney general, arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice this morning for the high court legal challenge to the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shami Chakrabarti (centre), the shadow attorney general, arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice this morning for the high court legal challenge to the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70c0928f081f0141f4e077\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T08:14:16.917Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 sets outs Boris Johnson's election message to voters</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>General elections are all about choices and what Boris Johnson has been been doing this week has been trying to frame the forthcoming election as a choice between someone who will deliver Brexit by 31 October and someone who won\u2019t.

Here is another extract from the statement Number 10 released to journalists this morning.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Since becoming prime minister, Boris has promised more investment for our NHS, more police on our streets to tackle violent crime and more funding for our schools to ensure every child has an excellent education, regardless of where they live. He has already delivered on his promises to level up the country and he wants to continue this agenda.</p> \n   <p>But to do this we must deliver Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is an irony in this. As one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign, you would have thought that Johnson might be proud of Brexit. But now it is as if he is very keen to change the subject.</p> \n  <p>The argument is also flawed, in at least two respects. First, the government does not need to leave the EU to spend more money on public services etc. In fact, all mainstream economic analysis says Brexit will leave less money for these services. And second, even after the UK has left the EU, the argument about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU will continue for years. Brexit is not going to vanish as a story anytime soon.</p> \n  <p>So why is No 10 pushing this argument? Because voters like to hear it, according to Politico\u2019s <strong>Jack Blanchard.</strong> Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/politico-london-playbook-presented-by-exxonmobil-the-mayhem-continues-blue-murder-watch-like-a-pro-part-ii/\">his London Playbook briefing yesterday.</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[A senior government minister] also predicted the opposition parties are playing straight into [Dominic] Cummings\u2019 hands \u2014 and that the Tories are now on course to win a snap election. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the numbers from CCHQ, it really is black and white,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople want it done.

Or they can choose Boris Johnson, who will not only deliver on that central promise to leave the EU, but also on the people\u2019s priorities.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T07:37:00.577Z\">at 8.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70af1a8f08b2e15bc1a996\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T06:48:43.395Z\">7.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 accuses Corbyn of 'cowardly insult to democracy' for not backing early election</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>appears to be preparing for another lectern moment.</p> \n  <p>A Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister would today \u201cspeak directly to the public, setting out the vital choice that faces our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The spokesman added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He will argue that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u2018surrender bill\u2019 will force the prime minister to go to Brussels and surrender to any demands they make.

It is clear the only action is to go back to the people and give them the opportunity to decide what they want: Boris to go to Brussels and get a deal, or leave without one on 31 October or Jeremy Corbyn arriving in Brussels with his surrender bill begging for more delay, more dither and accepting whatever terms Brussels imposes over our nation.</p> \n   <p>For Jeremy Corbyn to continue to avoid an election would be a cowardly insult to democracy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T07:42:37.202Z\">at 8.42am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70aeb58f08b2e15bc1a995\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T06:45:19.190Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/269157?fbclid=IwAR2EgtT0oDQhT_7ZF62i9d9_M8wEhrRKcikDGXjZMgYOQSVLVwm2uOF2Sds\">petition against proroguing parliament</a>, which was signed by more than 1.7m people, will be debated on Monday.</p> \n  <p>It only needed 100,000 signatures to secure a debate.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d70ac058f0891025b4482f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/matthewweaver\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T06:40:11.779Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The shadow chancellor, <strong>John McDonnell,</strong> has played down Keir Starmer\u2019s suggestion that Labour would only back an early election after the bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit has been implemented.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to Sky News, McDonnell said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Keir said that is one of the options, that\u2019s why we are consulting.

<p>Welcome especially to any members of the House of Lords who might happen to follow this live blog and who had a late night on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>Our honourable friends in the upper house were up debating the Benn bill until the wee hours when the deadlock finally broke and Lords voted in favour of getting the bill, which rules out a no-deal Brexit and was passed by the House of Commons earlier this week, through all stages of parliament by Friday afternoon, before parliament is suspended by Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords-agree-to-push-through-bill-preventing-no-deal-by-end-of-friday\">That agreement was reached around 1:30am</a> on Thursday when peers passed a business motion that means the Benn bill will be returned to the lower house by 5pm on Friday, ruling out the prospect of attempts at a filibuster.</p> \n  <p>From there, the bill can be voted on again by MPs on Monday and presented for royal assent. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support calls for a snap general election if the Benn bill preventing a no-deal Brexit received royal assent, so this is a significant step.</p> \n  <p>Peers are set to debate the Benn bill itself and amendments today. We\u2019ll be bringing you news of that debate, and everything else that is going on, as it happens. As I have been throughout the week, I\u2019ll be kicking things off before handing over to my colleagues.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up the blog for now. Our main story is here. Thanks for reading. Boris Johnson was dealt a huge blow after his brother Jo Johnson announced he was quitting the cabinet, citing an \u201cunresolvable tension\u201d between his family loyalty and the national interest. The announcement seemed to rattle the Boris Johnson seriously as he gave a speech at a police training academy in West Yorkshire. His answer to questions on his brother\u2019s resignation were meandering and after thanking his sibling for his work as the universities minister and calling him a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d, he admitted Brexit \u201cdivides families\u201d. Johnson pledged he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than bow to the demands of the no-deal bill passed by the House of Commons and request a Brexit extension. MPs will be asked on Monday to vote for early election said Jacob Rees-Mogg. However, Jeremy Corbyn looks poised to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s demand for a 15 October election for a second time on Monday. Despite being taunted by Johnson as a \u201cchlorinated chicken\u201d who is afraid of facing the public, Corbyn is holding out for an election on Labour\u2019s own terms \u2013 most likely at a later date. Jacob Rees-Mogg has apologised after comparing a consultant who helped draw up no-deal medical plans to the disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield. Rees-Mogg had told MPs that, in warning about the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on medical supplies, Nicholl was being as irresponsible as Wakefield, who was struck off the medical register in 2010 after suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Rees-Mogg apologised after intense pressure from the medical profession, as well as Westminster colleagues. Michael Gove is to meet Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, at the weekend for talks on Brexit as tensions mount over Brexit and the Irish border. The meeting, in Cambridge, will take place just before Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin on Monday when he will meet the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for the first time since becoming prime minister. The pound has slipped back a little in early overnight trading. It is buying $1.2322 at the moment after hitting a five-week high of $1.2353 after the chances of a no-deal Brexit receded slightly this week. Against the euro it is \u20ac1.1166. But Neil Wilson, chief analyst at Markets.com in London, cautioned that the Brexit \u201cpantomime\u201d still had some way to run. \u201cThe political situation remains very fluid and uncertain, making this trade very hard to call,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only certainty is that the pound is exposed to a significant amount of headline risk and volatility as markets react to the news flow. That said, the trend right now is positive.\u201d Then of course there was the Evening Standard, which underwent some revisions between editions. Good evening, this is Kate Lyons taking the blog back from Kevin Rawlinson. I will bring you any late-night developments before we shut the blog down for the day. And let\u2019s kick things off with a selection of some of the papers. Shortly after Rees-Mogg apologised, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, intervened to \u201cstick up for doctors\u201d: A little background on this issue: Rees-Mogg clashed with Nicholl over no-deal Brexit contingency plans the latter helped to draw up. The consultant neurologist spoke out as a whistleblower over the government\u2019s apparent inability to stockpile certain drugs. His comments on a radio phone-in prompted criticism from the ardent Brexiter. Later \u2013 and while sheltered by Parliamentary privilege \u2013 Rees-Mogg told MPs that Nicholl\u2019s actions rendered him as irresponsible as Wakefield, who was struck off the medical register in 2010 after suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. During a Commons business statement, Rees-Mogg said: Preparations are in place and they are being done with remarkable efficiency. But yes, a lot of Remainers wish to make our skins crawl. What he had to say, I will repeat it, is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield in threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union. What level of irresponsibility was that? And I\u2019m afraid it seems to me that Dr David Nicholl is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has apologised to Dr David Nicholl for comparing him to Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced anti-vaxxer who was widely blamed for the MMR jab scare. According to the Press Association, Rees-Mogg has said: I apologise to Dr Nicholl for the comparison with Dr Wakefield. I have the utmost respect for all of the country\u2019s hardworking medical professionals and the work they do in caring for the people of this country. The government is working closely with the NHS, industry and distributors to help ensure the supply of medicine and medical products remains uninterrupted once we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances. Rees-Mogg had earlier come in for serious criticism from high profile sources, including the chief medical officer for England and the British Medical Association. (See: 7.15pm and 4.35pm) The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has warned that there is \u201cno such thing as a clean break\u201d \u2013 Brexit deal or no Brexit deal \u2013 with difficult and complex negotiations on the future relationship with the EU whatever the outcome of talks. In a speech in Dublin to the British and Irish Chambers of Commerce, he has said: If there is no deal \u2013 and I believe we may have to live with no deal for a period \u2013 then, at a certain point, we will have to begin negotiations again. The first and only items on the agenda ... will be citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement with the EU and a solution to the Irish border. Varadkar acknowledged for the first time that some checks on goods and live animals entering the Republic or Ireland would take place \u201cnear the border\u201d. And he stressed that the Irish government was \u201copen to alternatives\u201d to the backstop \u2013 but that they had to be realistic and legally binding. \u201cWe have received no such proposals to date,\u201d he said. In what appeared to be a pre-emptive strike against expected proposals from Boris Johnson that Ireland align itself to the UK to avoid disruption, he said: Whatever happens, Ireland will not be dragged out of the single European market. And Varadkar added and update on discussions with the UK prime minister: Recently, Prime Minister Johnson and I spoke by phone. We spoke of our shared desire to see the Northern Ireland political institutions reinstated. We shared our perspectives on the withdrawal agreement and agreed that our teams would establish one-to-one contact. We will meet again in Dublin on Monday. Unfortunately, given political developments in the UK, there is a significant and growing risk of no-deal. We don\u2019t wish to see a no-deal Brexit and we will continue our efforts to avoid one, but not at any cost. Unlike some, I see no upsides to no-deal. I do fear it. But I am prepared for it. Here\u2019s some more detail on the criticism of Johnson from the West Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, Labour\u2019s Mark Burns-Williamson: To use police officers as the backdrop to what became a political speech was inappropriate and they shouldn\u2019t have been put in that position. It clearly turned into a rant about Brexit, the opposition and a potential general election. There\u2019s no way that police officers should\u2019ve formed the backdrop to a speech of that nature. Asked if Johnson should apologise, he said: Yes, because he\u2019s used the pretence of an announcement around police recruitment for mainly a political speech. Burns-Williamson said he had expressed his concerns to the chief constable of West Yorkshire police and asked for an explanation around what happened. Among the stranger moments of Johnson\u2019s speech this afternoon was a halting attempt to recite the police caution: For the record, it\u2019s: You do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Plaid Cymru will not back the prime minister\u2019s motion for an early election when the question is asked again on Monday, the party\u2019s Westminster Leader Liz Saville Roberts has confirmed. We face one of the weakest governments in history. Without a majority and hamstrung by a mess of their own making. Boris Johnson is on the ropes and we must not give him the reprieve of a general election on his terms. Voting for the government motion will undermine the progress we have made blocking a no-deal Brexit. If other opposition parties\u2019 priority is stopping this Brexit mess, now is a better time than any to take control and deliver a fresh referendum. We won\u2019t dance to his tune. In this Parliament we can beat both Boris and Brexit. More from Sir John Major, who has urged Boris Johnson to ditch his \u201covermighty advisers\u201d before politics is poisoned; thought to be a reference to Dominic Cummings. Calling for the 21 rebel Tory MPs who voted against the government on Tuesday night to be reinstated, Major told an audience at the CBI annual dinner: The government must change its tone. Ministers routinely insult half the electorate as \u201cRemoaners\u201d. The surgeon who drew up the Yellowhammer risk register of epilepsy and neurology drugs is told he is a \u201cfear-mongering Remainer\u201d. Businessmen are warned that a negative attitude on Brexit will lead to their companies being frozen out of any future government consultation. This is behaviour I never thought to see from any British government, and it must stop. The abuse comes from Cabinet ministers; and the threats from No 10 special advisers. I repeat: it must stop. Ahead lie many challenges. If we are to meet them we need government of the highest quality, not government by bluster and threat in a climate of aggressive bullying. While the former Tory leader made no explicit reference to Cummings, he said politicians had \u201cseen overmighty advisers before\u201d. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly. I offer the Prime Minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly. And, referring to Brexit generally, he added: Anti-Europeans may cheer, but a weaker Europe leaves the UK more at the mercy of decisions taken by a \u2013 I hope temporarily \u2013 dysfunctional United States, and a long-term autocratic China. It also leaves the UK more vulnerable to Putin\u2019s aggressive and assertive Russia. None of that will be welcome, but it is the inevitable legacy of Brexit. Our new UK government knows this to be true. Yet they ignore it \u2013 and pursue our exit from Europe on an artificial date, without a deal. Some do so for ideological reasons. Others for political and personal advantage. Neither the ideologue nor the self-interested Brexiteer appears to put our national wellbeing first. Our new Cabinet has no majority and no mandate ... It is not a Cabinet of all available talents. It is a faction of a faction, with no counter-balance of opinion to hold it back. Upon Brexit, the Cabinet non\u2013believers are mere window dressing. They will not be listened to, and will always be out-voted. Earlier, we reported that Jacob Rees-Mogg had been heavily criticised for using parliamentary privilege to attack the reputation of a doctor who has warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit (see: 4.35pm). Now, No 10 are distancing themselves from his comments: And the chief medical officer for England, Prof Sally Davies, has written to Rees-Mogg, calling his actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d: Judges are expected to announce their decision on Friday on the latest legal challenge to Boris Johnson over his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and two other judges at the high court in London have been urged to find that Johnson\u2019s 28 August advice to the Queen to prorogue Parliament for an \u201cexceptional\u201d length of time was an \u201cunlawful abuse of power\u201d. After hearing submissions on Thursday on an urgent judicial review application brought by Gina Miller, Lord Burnett announced that the hearing would be adjourned until 10am on Friday. In a witness statement released after the hearing, Sir John Major said it was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d for the government to \u201cseek to bypass\u201d Parliament because it does not agree with the proposed course of action on a certain policy. The former prime minister, who joined the Conservative party on his 16th birthday, said: I served in Parliament for over 20 years both as a backbench MP and as a government minister at cabinet and more junior levels. I was, of course, prime minister for nearly seven years and am very proud to have been in the Commons and a minister. I have huge admiration for our Parliament and am a keen supporter of its rights and duties. I cannot stand idly by and watch them set aside in this fashion. I appreciate that this is not the government\u2019s stated intention for proroguing Parliament, but for the reasons set out in this statement, the inescapable inference to be drawn is that the prorogation is to prevent Parliament from exercising its right to disagree with the government and to legislate as it sees fit. He said the government had not adequately explained why it needed to suspend Parliament for as long as five weeks. Essentially, the protection of individual rights afforded by Parliament is being compromised. In order to allegedly protect the democratic outcome of the referendum, the government believes it is justified in suspending the UK\u2019s democratic processes to achieve its desired ends. This is unacceptable and is the reason I was determined to assist in these proceedings. Here\u2019s more from Yvette Cooper, who has said she will be taking the matter further: For Boris Johnson to make so many police stop their training and work to be part of his political stunt is an abuse of power. Police officers and trainees are overstretched and need to be able to get on with their job, not have to waste time listening to Boris Johnson\u2019s political press conference. For Boris Johnson to draw so many of them into a long, election-driven event like this is completely inappropriate and it is unfair on the people of West Yorkshire who are entitled to expect that their police are allowed to get on with the job of working and training to keep them safe. I am writing to the Cabinet Secretary as well as the West Yorkshire Chief Constable, John Robins, to ask how this has happened and what guidelines were followed. Johnson\u2019s use of police officers as a backdrop to his speech has been criticised by opponents, including the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott: Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons Home Affairs committee, has said: And then there\u2019s this from the Labour MP, David Lammy: And the BBC\u2019s Danny Shaw reports that the local police and crime commissioner, Labour\u2019s Mark Burns-Williamson, is less than happy: The Northern Ireland minister, Nick Hurd, has become the latest Tory MP to announce he will not stand at the next general election as he cited the \u201congoing division\u201d over Brexit. The Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner MP said: Fourteen years ago, my intention was to serve in Parliament for as long as my constituents continued to elect me. However, much has changed since then. Politics is now dominated by the ongoing division over Brexit. More happily, my private life has been changed profoundly by the birth of my two youngest children. I now feel that it is time for me to make a change and embrace a new challenge. After a very great deal of thought, I have decided not to stand again as a candidate at the next general election. And this is what some other journalists and commentators are saying about the Johnson speech. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From my colleague Patrick Wintour From Politico Europe\u2019s Jack Blanchard From the Daily Mail\u2019s Peter Oborne That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. That was the most extraordinary prime ministerial press conference we\u2019ve seen for years - perhaps not quite as dramatic as Theresa May\u2019s \u201cnothing has changed\u201d meltdown, but certainly more peculiar. Even by Johnson\u2019s standards, it was rambling and shambolic. The only rational explanation I can think for what happened is that it is all part of some ultra-cunning plan to convince Jeremy Corbyn that he can vote for an election because Johnson will be such a hopeless campaigner, but life normally doesn\u2019t work like that. If it looks like a cock-up, it probably is a cock-up. First, the backdrop was pure Donald Trump. Although ostensibly an event to promote the government\u2019s police recruitment plans, this was obviously a party political event - No 10 described it this morning as day one of the election campaign - and so there was something clearly improper about getting the police to act as extras on set. And if you do want to present yourself as a politician committed to supporting the police, it is best not to force them to stand in the sun for so long (Johnson started about an hour late) that they start dropping like flies. If you do invite people to listen to a speech and then force them to wait, you should at least prepare something of merit to say. But Johnson wasn\u2019t speaking from a script, and he appeared to have given very little thought to what he wanted to say about policing (beyond a threadbare argument about policing being at the heart of a successful economy). At one point he launched into a very bizarre routine about the police caution; quite what that was all about remains a mystery. Of course, sounding improvised is part of the Johnson schtick - in his Churchill biography he quotes approvingly the FE Smith line that Churchill \u201cspent the best years of his life preparing his impromptu remarks\u201d; Johnson has mastered the same trick himself - but today this did not sound like artful spontaneity. To be honest, it sounded like he had had a glass too many at lunchtime. On Monday Johnson stood outside Number 10 and said he did not want an election. Today\u2019s message was all about taunting/shaming Corbyn into agreeing one. Even someone as practiced at inconsistency as Johnson would find this hard to pull off, and in the office where I was watching his insincerity seemed obvious - although perhaps outside the \u201cbubble\u201d people may be willing to credit his claim that he doesn\u2019t really want an election at all. To his credit, Johnson did take a large number of questions. His most interesting line was his assertion that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than request an article 50 extension in October, as he might be obliged to by a bill becoming law on Monday. That did not sound literally true either, but at least that was a hyperbole untruth, not a statement of bad faith. Perhaps leave voters, and the wider group of voters who just want the Brexit crisis saga to end, will cheer this message. But whether that compensates for the overall impression of omnishambles is another matter. Q: Corbyn says he cannot trust you to have an election before the EU summit in October? Johnson claims this is a new charge. He says he wants an election on 15 October. \u201cEarlier if he wants ... let\u2019s crack on with it.\u201d He says he does not see how the UK\u2019s negotiating position can be torpedoed. One of the police officers standing behind Johnson has just stood down. She seems to be feeling faint or ill. Johnson expresses some concern, and then winds up his remarks. As Johnson is winding up, the officer stands up again. And that\u2019s it. I will post a verdict and summary shortly. Q: Are you planning an all-Ireland regime for agri-foods? Johnson says there is the germ of a solution to the backstop problem in the late Ian Paisley comment about the Northern Irish being British, but their cattle being Irish. But he says what is crucial is the idea of democratic control by the people of the UK. Q: When are you going to have an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party, as you promised in the BBC TV debate? Johnson says he will have an inquiry into all kinds of racism in the party. He does not say when it will start. Q: Do you regret the purge of MPs? Johnson says the bill passed yesterday will make it harder for him to get a Brexit deal. Under this plan, Brussels would decide how long the UK stayed in the EU. He says he cannot see how that is democratic. (Actually, the bill does not say that. The UK would get the final say. More details here.) Discipline is sometimes tough, he says. Q: Can you promise not to go back to Brussels and ask for an extension? Yes, says Johnson. I would rather be dead in a ditch. He says an extension would cost \u00a31bn a month and be \u201ctotally pointless\u201d. Q: You said you would unite the country when you became leader. But you are now splitting your own party, and your own brother won\u2019t even support you. Johnson says people disagree about Brexit. But the way to unite this country is to get this done, he says. Q: Shouldn\u2019t you be next to resign? Johnson says MPs said they would respect the referendum. He says there is a stark contrast between his approach and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. He says they are making it impossible for the country to leave the EU, and for the country to have an election. He says Corbyn must be the first opposition lead to oppose an election. That goes against his job description, he says. Q: Aren\u2019t people entitled to ask, if your own brother can\u2019t back you, why should anyone else? Johnson says his brother Jo is fantastic guy and was a fantastic minister for science. (His most recent job was universitiies minister.) He says Jo wants the government to sort Brexit out. And he says Jo has said this afternoon that he supports his domestic policies. (See 3.10pm.) Johnson is now talking about Brexit. He says he will take the UK out by 31 October. Or someone else would have to take over. But that is not the best course, he says. He says an election should decide. He says he \u201chates banging on about Brexit\u201d. I don\u2019t want an election at all ... But frankly I don\u2019t see any other way. He says people must choose between sending him or Jeremy Corbyn to the Brussels summit in October. He apologises for bringing \u201cthis painful subject\u201d up. People do not want to see politicians going on about Brexit, he says. He says they want to see politicians focusing on people\u2019s concerns, like policing. But we must, must, must settle this EU debate. Policing is \u201cthe top priority of this government\u201d, he says. My colleague Jessica Elgot is not impressed. Johnson asks police what the police caution is. None of them read it out to him, so he tries to recite it himself. You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be taken down as evidence and used in evidence against you. (Except Johnson does not say it coherently. He stumbles, and gives up half way through. Is he expecting someone to help him out? It is not clear, but it looks as though he has given no thought at all to what he wants to say.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says today is the launch of his programme to recruit a large number of extra police officers. He wants to deliver on the priorities of the British people. He says he hopes people saw the spending announcement yesterday. In his view, policing is the bedrock of society. It is what gives people the confidence to grow the economy. He says he used to be mayor of London, crime commissioner for London. The most important thing politicians can do is back the police. It is up to politicians to provide \u201ctop cover\u201d for the police, he says. More from my colleague Kate Proctor at the Boris Johnson speech And this is from the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire. At the Daily Telegraph Johnson was notorious for always filing his column very, very, very late. NHS trusts in Kent have block-booked hotel rooms for staff who may not be able to get into work because the country\u2019s roads are gridlocked if there is a no-deal Brexit. Health service bosses have also discussed with the police using them to get patients through unusually heavy traffic to hospitals in Ashford and Canterbury, which are near the ports of Dover and Folkestone, the Health Service Journal reports today. East Kent University Hospitals NHS trust, which runs the two hospitals, confirmed to HSJ that it has \u201cbooked a small number of hotel rooms close to our emergency hospitals as a precautionary measure, for an initial two-week period [after 31 October]\u201d. The William Harvey hospital near Ashford, which is the area\u2019s main trauma centre - where the most seriously injured patients are treated - \u201cis particularly vulnerable because it is located just off the M20, which is already facing significant delays and disruption due to long-term upgrade work\u201d, HSJ adds. And here is a clip from Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, speaking in the Welsh assembly debate. From the Welsh assembly\u2019s twitter feed From my colleague Kate Proctor, who is in Yorkshire for the Boris Johnson speech Peers have been debating the Benn bill this afternoon, the one intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The bill is expected to clear the Lords by 5pm tomorrow, but Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, used his speech to attack it strongly. He said: This bill represents an attempt by the legislature to assume the mantle of government. That is why it is wrong. That is why it is illegitimate ... It gets us nowhere. We\u2019ve had one extension. It\u2019s given six months of extra time which resulted in no conclusion. It\u2019s bad enough that parliament thinks it knows better than the British people on this issue. It\u2019s even worse that parliament, as things stand at the moment, is denying the British people a general election, in which they would have the right to decide ... This bill is one of the final acts of a House of Commons which has proved itself manifestly incapable of meeting the challenges in front of it. Boris Johnson\u2019s speech is about to start. He is speaking at a police training centre in Yorkshire. There is a live feed at the top of this page. And here are images of the key documents. Confidential No 10 documents about the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament have now been published, as my colleague Severin Carrell anticipated earlier. (See 1.11pm.) The lawyer Jolyon Maugham has tweeted the links. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has been strongly criticised for using parliamentary privilege to attack the reputation of a doctor who has warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. On Monday Rees-Mogg was involved in a row on his LBC phone-in with David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist drew up a risk register of epilepsy and neurology drugs for the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer plans for no deal. Rees-Mogg said he did not accept Nicholl\u2019s claim that people could die because of drug shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Nicholl subsequently described the MP as an ignorant \u201cmuppet\u201d. Today Rees-Mogg resumed the dispute at business questions, comparing Nicholl to Andrew Wakefield, the doctor whose discredited research linking autism to the MMR vaccine has been blamed for vaccination levels falling, putting lives at risk. Rees-Mogg told MPs: Preparations are in place and they are being done with remarkable efficiency. But yes, a lot of remainers wish to make our skins crawl. What [Nicholl] had to say, I will repeat it, is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield in threatening that people will die because we leave the European Union. What level of irresponsibility was that? And I\u2019m afraid it seems to me that Dr David Nicholl is as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield. In response, the SNP MP Carol Monaghan said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment suggested the government wanted to cause \u201creputational damage to experts such as Dr David Nicholl who dare to challenge the government or indeed raise legitimate concerns about the impact of no-deal?\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments were \u201coffensive, irresponsible [and] shameful\u201d. Alistair Burt, a former health minister who had the Tory whip withdrawn on Tuesday after he voted against the government, described Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment as \u201csheer irrationality\u201d. The BMA said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. In a tweet Nicholl himself said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comment was defamatory. Here is the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast. Heather Stewart is joined by Theresa May\u2019s former press secretary Paul Harrison, the psephologist John Curtice and Guardian journalists Jonathan Freedland, Zoe Williams and Larry Elliott to discuss Boris Johnson\u2019s triple Commons defeat, Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review and the likelihood of a snap general election. These are from the BBC\u2019s Damian Grammaticas. @ph_lamberts is Philippe Lamberts, co-president of the Greens/European Free Alliance group in the European parliament and a member of the parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Speaking to Boris Johnson earlier, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, claimed that a US-UK trade deal could potentially quadruple the volume of trade between the two countries. Pence said: I spoke to President Trump this morning, your friend, and he sent his very best greetings and to assure you that the United States supports the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. But he also wanted me to convey that the United States is ready, willing and able to immediately negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK. The president often says the US has the biggest economy in the world and we truly believe that a free trade agreement between the United States and the UK could increase trade between our country by three or four times. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, has strongly condemned the government\u2019s decision to described the Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d. His tweet references a comment from Sajid Javid, the chancellor, but it is Boris Johnson who is using the phrase most enthusiastically. The Welsh assembly is has been holding a debate on the Brexit crisis this afternoon. Earlier the first minister Mark Drakeford spoke in Cardiff about his government and Labour\u2019s approach to the crisis. Here are his main points: Drakeford said no-deal Brexit would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the economy and rural life in Wales. Asked what citizens would notice in the first week after a no-deal exit, he said travel to Europe would be more difficult, access to some medicines less secure and claimed shoppers would notice goods missing from supermarket shelves. \u201cPeople will rapidly see impacts.\u201d He said Labour wanted a general election. He said: Of course we want a general election. What we\u2019re not prepared to do is sign up to a general election until we are as certain as we possibly can be that this prime minister would not subvert any agreement and still try to find a way to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. He dismissed the idea that during the next general election Welsh Labour should forge pacts with other parties to counter a possible Tory/Brexit Party alliance. He said: I\u2019m instinctively not attracted to them [pacts]. I think it is better than the democratic choices lie in the hands of the voters rather than in deals between parties. I think we have to trust the citizens of Wales to make their decision. He said he would not be releasing the details of Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 the civil contingency planning \u2013 that it is privy to. He said the Yellowhammer papers have been shared with the Welsh government on a confidential basis. On possible problems at Holyhead port on Anglesey \u2013 which links mainland Britain to the Republic of Ireland \u2013 if there is a no deal Brexit, Drakeford said the government\u2019s intelligence suggested that there would be delays of hours rather than days. But he said the position was \u201cinherently volatile\u201d. He said the \u201csmallest changes\u201d could lead to traffic jams stretching off the island on to the north Wales mainland. He stressed that Welsh Labour was a party of remain, even though Wales overall voted leave. He said: We will will continue to argue that Wales\u2019 best interests are best protected by continued membership of the EU. Leaving the EU without a deal will be felt in the lives of every single family and every single community in Wales. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has put a message on Twitter saying it \u201chas\u201d been a pleasure to work with Jo Johnson, the outgoing universities minister. Johnson has now been removed from the official list of ministers on the government\u2019s website. But the business department is still unable to confirm that his ministerial resignation will take effect from today. Asked about this, it is just referring reporters to Leadsom\u2019s tweet. Johnson\u2019s own tweet about the timing of his departure was ambiguous. (See 11.26am.) Perhaps Boris Johnson hopes his brother will stay on for a bit? According to the Sun, he begged Jo last night not to quit. The Sun also quotes Jo Johnson saying that, apart from on Brexit, his brother\u2019s policies are excellent. He told the paper: What is so clearly in the national interest is everything the government is doing in its strong, one nation domestic policy agenda: more police on the streets, more doctors and nurses in our hospitals, a welcoming face to scientists and international students. That\u2019s exactly what a Conservative prime minister should be doing and what Boris does so well. Michael Gove is to meet Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, at the weekend for talks on Brexit as tensions mount over Brexit and the Irish border. The meeting, in Cambridge, will take place just before Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin on Monday when he will meet the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for the first time since becoming prime minister. From my colleague Jessica Elgot More Labour MPs have been using Twitter to say that the party should not vote for an early election until after an article 50 extension has been agreed. Here are the latest tweets I\u2019ve seen, echoing views from other Labour MPs covered earlier. (See 11.03am and 11.07am.) From Anna McMorrin From Paul Williams From Paul Sweeney From Gareth Thomas From David Lammy From Owen Smith From Ben Bradshaw But Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, has released a video this afternoon saying that the party would be prepared to vote for a general election after the Benn bill has got royal consent. That is what Corbyn told the Commons last night. (See 10.05am.) Here is Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, on Jo Johnson\u2019s decision to stand down. Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative former environment secretary, has said she is standing down at the next election. Along with Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey (they are both West Midlands MPs with many constituents working in the car industry), she tabled amendments earlier this year that led to the Commons voting against a no-deal Brexit. (The votes were not binding.) She also rebelled yesterday to back the Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has rejected the claim attributed to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, that talks with the UK are in \u201ca state of paralysis\u201d. (See 10.33am.) The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: I haven\u2019t seen anything from Michel Barnier on the record but in any event I would completely reject that assessment. Both sides agree to continue talks tomorrow after constructive discussions yesterday and we have seen from EU leaders that there is a willingness to find and agree solutions to the problems we have with the old deal. Boris Johnson has told the US vice-president, Mike Pence, that the NHS would not be for sale in any post-Brexit trade deal and that Britain is \u201cnot keen on that chlorinated chicken\u201d. At a meeting in Downing Street, Johnson said: The National Health Service is not on the table as far as our negotiations go. We are not keen on that chlorinated chicken. More on Jo Johnson. This is from Robert Hutton\u2019s report for Bloomberg. When [Jo Johnson\u2019s] older brother ran for the leadership in the summer, he joined the campaign, apparently having accepted that Britain had to leave the European Union. He took the view that own electoral district of Orpington, on the edge of southeast London, would be likely to fall to the Brexit party unless Britain left, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Privately, he also took the view that Boris Johnson had no interest in a no-deal Brexit, and would seek a deal with the EU and then force hard-line Brexiteers in the party to vote for it. His resignation suggests that view has changed. Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, has said confidential Downing Street memos showing Boris Johnson agreed to prorogue parliament 12 days before he asked the Queen might be published. The BBC and News UK, the publisher of the Times and Sun, applied to the court of session on Thursday morning to release three papers written by Nikki da Costa and the prime minister where they secretly agreed the prorogation strategy on 15 August. Three Scottish judges \u2013 Lord Carloway, the lord president, and Lord Drummond-Young and Lord Brodie \u2013 are hearing an appeal by lawyers for 75 MPs and peers against a decision by Lord Doherty yesterday to reject their claims Johnson has illegally prorogued parliament. Carloway said on Thursday morning the court could both order them to be published and released in unredacted form, at the end of the hearing, if he felt they were central to the appeal and it was also in the public interest to do so. The MPs\u2019 lawyer, Aidan O\u2019Neill, revealed earlier this week he had been given three heavily-redacted memos marked \u201cOfficial sensitive Number 10 only\u201d hours before their court hearing on Tuesday, in breach of a court deadline. All three were circulated inside Number 10, including to Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, and Ed Lister, his chief of staff, but no cabinet minister other than Johnson. The first on 15 August from Da Costa setting out their prorogation strategy was ticked by Johnson, with his scribbled note \u201cyes\u201d. He replied the next day with a handwritten note which said: \u201cwhole September session [at Westminster] is a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs are earning their crust. I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this prorogation.\u201d The UK government said they were blacked out because the censored parts were not relevant or protected by \u201clegal professional privilege\u201d. Andrew Webster QC, for the UK government, told the court it was essential to keep them confidential to preserve cabinet confidentiality. In what O\u2019Neill described as a snub to the Scottish courts, they were not given to the court of session as primary pieces of evidence backed up as affidavits, but were released only because they were being submitted as evidence to the parallel Gina Miller case in London, which started today. Kenny McBrearty QC, appearing for the BBC and News UK, said it was in the public interest and in the interests of open justice for those memos to be published in full. If Number 10 had decided it was appropriate it was to give them to the court, where they were read out in part by O\u2019Neill on Tuesday, then clearly they were not totally confidential. O\u2019Neill has made a separate submission to the three judges, arguing the documents could only be redacted by the court. Downing Street could not unilaterally decide which sections to release, without proper scrutiny. Downing Street had also chosen not to apply for a public interest immunity (PII) certificate \u2013 an orthodox route to keep key documents secret. Asked about Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation at business questions, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said MPs were used to the idea that people within families might disagree on policy. He pointed out that his own sister, Annunziata, had jointed the Brexit party and got elected as an MEP. In the Commons the Tory MP Sir David Amess has just asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, if he agrees that the party conferences could be shortened, to allow the Commons to sit for longer in the autumn. Rees-Mogg did not agree, but John Bercow, the Speaker, enthusiastically backed the idea, saying that it was \u201cbizarre\u201d that so much time was set aside for the meeting of private organisations. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has just told MPs that on Monday the government will hold a second vote on having an early general election. There was a vote last night that was passed, but without the two-thirds majority needed for the vote to lead to an early general election (two thirds of all MPs would have to vote for one, not just two thirds of MPs participating in the division). Under Commons rules the government is not meant to put motions to a vote if they have already been defeated. But government sources say that this would not apply next week because Labour abstained last night on the grounds that the Benn bill, designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, was not yet law. But by Monday next week that bill should be law, so the circumstances will have changed, justifying a second vote. Before MPs debate an early election on Monday, Rees-Mogg said they would also consider the remaining stages of the Benn bill, following its return from the Lords, as well as hold a debate required under the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, issued this statement welcoming Luciana Berger to her party. (See 11.14am.) Swinson said: Luciana is a passionate advocate for women\u2019s and LGBT+ rights, and she\u2019s at the forefront of efforts to counter antisemitism and prevent discrimination. I\u2019m delighted to welcome her to the Liberal Democrats, where we can work together to stop Brexit and build a fairer, more equal society for all. Luciana becomes the fourth MP in three months to cross the floor and join the Liberal Democrats. We\u2019re thrilled to add her perspective, expertise and skills to our ever-growing parliamentary team. The Liberal Democrats are growing in strength as we lead the fight to stop Brexit altogether. We are fully behind a people\u2019s vote, and we are the rallying point for remainers and the liberal centre ground. The other MPs who have joined the Lib Dems recently are Chuka Umunna, Sarah Wollaston and Phillip Lee. And this is what Berger said in a statement about her move. This is a moment of national crisis. The Liberal Democrats are unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit and are committed to securing Britain\u2019s future as a tolerant, open and inclusive society. I am joining Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats today, in the national interest, to offer a vital, positive alternative to Johnson and Corbyn and help build a future that our country deserves. Rachel Johnson, sister of Boris and Jo, claims the family avoids discussing Brexit, especially over meals. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, also raised Jo Johnson at first minister\u2019s questions, the Sun\u2019s Chris Musson reports. Here is Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, on Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation. Boris Johnson poses such a threat that even his own brother doesn\u2019t trust him. We have now had four higher education ministers in two years - just the latest sign of the chaos that the Tories have caused to education and the threat that a disastrous no-deal Brexit poses to our colleges and universities. We need a general election as soon as no-deal is off the table, so that a Labour government can transform our education system and society so they work for the many, not just a privileged few. In the Brexit committee Michael Gove has just finished answering a series of questions about how Dover would cope with lorry arrivals in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, did not sound hugely reassured, and he concluded by asking Gove to admit that no one actually knows what will happen in the event of no deal. Gove did not contest this, but replied: The future is known only to the Almighty. Benn said unfortunately the Almighty would not be appearing as a witness. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has declined to give assurances to Labour that the government is not \u201crowing back\u201d on commitments on Ireland enshrined in the joint report signed by the EU and the UK in December 2017 that bookmarked the end of the first phase of Brexit talks. He was challenged by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, during Brexit questions in the Commons this morning to deny reports that it was \u201crowing back\u201d on the commitments. Barclay replied: There is no rowing back from the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. That\u2019s an area of common accord between us. Starmer reminded him he was asking him about the 2017 joint report, not the peace deal. \u201cI asked a careful question and I got a careful answer and it [the answer] wasn\u2019t to confirm full commitment,\u201d said Starmer. According to reports by RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly, officials in the EU were told that London was trying to reduce its commitments made in the report, which nearly torpedoed talks after the DUP objected to guarantees on north-south trade on the island of Ireland. RTE said officials were told that Boris Johnson was moving from its commitment to \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d to \u201cas frictionless as possible\u201d on the island of Ireland and resisting the agreed ambition for a \u201clegally operable\u201d solution for the island of Ireland and replacing it with \u201caspirational measures\u201d. From Sky\u2019s Adam Parsons This is from the Press Association. A Number 10 spokesman said Jo Johnson had been \u201ca brilliant, talented minister and a fantastic MP\u201d, and the prime minister \u201cas both a politician and brother understands this will not have been an easy matter for Jo\u201d. But No 10 still has not yet clarified whether Jo Johnson is leaving the government today, or at the election. Here is a live feed of Michael Gove giving evidence to the Brexit committee. Gove says the Operation Yellowhammer document, about the government\u2019s assumption for a no-deal Brexit, was presented to a cabinet committee in the first week of August, and discussed on 2 August. But he says that it was produced over a series of months. Q: Why did you describe it as old? Gove says many of the assumptions in the report were old. They had to be tested. Q: You described it as absolutely the worst case scenario. Was that correct? Gove says it was a reasonable worst case scenario. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. There is a live feed here. Hilary Benn, the chair, is asking the questions. Q: On The Andrew Marr Show you could not say you would comply with the bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit because you had not seen it. Now you have seen it, will you comply with it? Yes, says Gove. Gove says government will comply with the Benn bill if it becomes law. Jo Johnson has achieved a unique distinction; he is the only minister to have resigned twice over Brexit. In November last year he resigned as a transport minister in Theresa May\u2019s government because he could not support the withdrawal agreement. Other ministers who resigned at the time, like Dominic Raab, did so because they thought the agreement did not amount to a pure enough form of Brexit. Johnson agreed with them that it was an unsatisfactory compromise, but in a long statement explaining his resignation he said there should be a second referendum. He said: Given that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised, the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say. This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union. To those who say that is an affront to democracy given the 2016 result, I ask this. Is it more democratic to rely on a three-year-old vote based on what an idealised Brexit might offer, or to have a vote based on what we know it does actually entail? A majority of Orpington voters chose to leave the EU in 2016 and many of the close friends I have there, among them hard-working local Conservative party members, are passionately pro-Brexit. I respect their position. But I know from meetings I have had with local members that many are as dismayed as me by the course of negotiations and about the actual choice now on offer. Two-and-a-half years on, the practical Brexit options are now clear and the public should be asked to choose between the different paths facing our country: we will all have different positions on that choice, but I think many in my local party, in the Orpington constituency and around the country would welcome having the last word on the government\u2019s Brexit proposals. This is from Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank More on Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation. (Or pending resignation - we\u2019re still not clear when he is actually clearing his ministerial desk.) From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuennsberg From the Labour MEP Theresa Griffin Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation comes as the pound hits a five-week high, on hopes that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Sterling has rallied to $1.2345 this morning, its highest level since late July. It has now gained almost four cents since Tuesday, it\u2019s best two-day run in 10 months, as investors welcome efforts to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Our Business Live blog has more details. From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes Jo Johnson, like his brother Boris, was a journalist before he became MP. Journalists are supposed to express ideas clearly. But his tweet today is loaded with ambiguity. It is not just that it is unclear from what he is saying whether he is resigning as a minister today, or whether he is just saying he will no longer serve in government because within the next few weeks he will no longer by an MP. But he also says he has been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d. MPs often decide to leave politics so that can spend more time with their children. Johnson and his wife have two. But in this sentence \u201cfamily loyalty\u201d seems to be a reference to his brother instead. And \u201cnational interest\u201d seems to be an admission that he can no longer support the government\u2019s policies (although, if Johnson were going to take a stand against his brother\u2019s strategy, the obvious time to do it would have been on Tuesday or Wednesday, when MPs were voting on no deal). And No 10 can\u2019t clarify yet whether or not Jo Johnson is leaving the government today, or at the election. The business department won\u2019t say if Jo Johnson is still a minister in their department or not. Johnson is standing down at the next election. But not Boris. It\u2019s Jo, his brother. He has just tweeted this. Johnson has been MP for Orpington since 2010. He also attends cabinet as universities minister. He got promoted even though he voted remain in 2010 and he is much more pro-European than his brother. It is hard to believe that he is comfortable about the idea of a no-deal Brexit, although he has not questioned his brother\u2019s strategy in public. This tweet implies that he is standing down as an MP at the forthcoming election, and leaving the government then, rather than that he is resigning as a minister today, but it is not entirely clear. I will clarify that as soon as I can. Luciana Berger, the former Labour MP who left to join what became Change UK, has joined the Liberal Democrats. She is the second MP to join the Lib Dems this week. On Tuesday the Conservative former minister Phillip Lee crossed the floor to join Jo Swinson\u2019s party. And here is another Labour MP, Ian Murray, saying the party should \u201cgo long\u201d in relation to an early general election (as John McDonnell put it - see 10.05am). Here are three Labour MP saying this morning that the party should not vote for an early general election to take place unless it is taking place after 31 October. From Tonia Antoniazzi From Anna Turley From Catherine McKinnell The Conservative MP Simon Hoare has suggested there was something Stalinist about the purge of 21 Tories who had the whip removed on Tuesday for voting against the government in favour of the move to allow MPs to debate the Benn bill. If you are interested in minute by minute coverage of the high court legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks, here are some journalists providing good Twitter updates. Joshua Rozenberg Dominic Casciani Matthew Holehouse Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has told EU diplomats that the Brexit talks are stuck in \u201cparalysis\u201d, the Financial Times is reporting (paywall). It says: The EU\u2019s chief negotiator told envoys from member states that Britain was determined to diverge from EU standards as part of a future trade deal, adding further tension between Mr Johnson\u2019s government and the bloc. According to a leaked diplomatic note seen by the Financial Times, Mr Barnier said: \u201cwe are currently in a state of paralysis\u201d. The warning came on the same day that David Frost, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, met for more than six hours with his EU counterpart. EU officials said Mr Frost provided no suggestions for how the UK could replace the Irish backstop from the Brexit divorce deal while maintaining an open border in Ireland ... Along with demands on the backstop, Mr Frost has also called for a trade agreement that would allow the UK to break free of EU regulations in areas such as social and environmental standards. The demand reneges on promises made by Theresa May\u2019s government and has emerged as another stumbling bloc in the talks over the past week. Mr Barnier warned EU envoys that any free-trade deal where Britain could undercut Brussels standards would face ratification problems in EU capitals. Some, such as Paris and The Hague, are determined not to allow Britain gain a competitive edge over the EU by undermining the single market after Brexit. One of the UK\u2019s most experienced senior judges, Lord Hope, has predicted that Scottish appeal judges will uphold a ruling that Boris Johnson is legally able to prorogue parliament. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for 75 MPs and peers and the anti-Brexit Good Law Project, appears before three appeal judges in Edinburgh this morning to urge them to overturn a ruling yesterday by Lord Doherty that Johnson was able under the constitution to suspend parliament. In London lawyers for Gina Miller, the legal campaigner, are appearing at the high court this morning and are also arguing the prime minister acted illegally in a parallel case under English law. Hope, previously a UK supreme court judge and head of the Scottish judiciary, told BBC Radio Scotland he believed both those cases and a similar action in Belfast really belonged at the supreme court. The supreme court is due to hear all three cases on 17 September \u2013 after Johnson is expected to suspend parliament. Hope said the court \u201chad to recover their people, many of whom are abroad, but they will be there in mid-September and the intention is to hear all three jurisdictions together. And I think the judges below [sitting in Edinburgh, London and Belfast] will be quite cautious and I suspect that the decision in Scotland won\u2019t be changed by the [appeal court]. But everything is open in the supreme court, which is where it really belongs. Lord Falconer, the former Labour cabinet minister and lord chancellor, agreed with Hope but said the senior judges hearing today\u2019s case in London may feel bold enough to strike prorogation down. On the Today programme this morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, confirmed that Labour has still not settled on when it wants an early election to happen. The easiest way for the PM to hold an early election would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for one (the threshold set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act), but this would require opposition support. An alternative approach would be to legislate to amend the FTPA, but even though this would require just a simple majority, Boris Johnson does not have one at the moment, meaning this route would also require opposition cooperation. At the start of this week Labour faced at least four possible options. 1) Agree an election immediately. 2) Agree an election once the Benn bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October becomes law, which is now due to happen next Monday. 3) Agree an election once the Benn bill has become law, and Johnson has provided some cast-iron assurance as to when the date will be. 4) Agree an election only after the EU has agreed to extend article 50 beyond the end of October. Assuming the PM did not agree a Brexit deal beforehand (which currently seems unlikely), this means that Labour would not vote for an early election until after 19 October, the deadline in the Benn bill for an article 50 request. The election would then take place in November at the earliest. Labour ruled out 1). But, in the debate last night, Jeremy Corbyn implied that 2) was his position. He told Johnson: \u201cLet [the Benn bill] pass and gain royal assent, and then we will back an election.\u201d But many in the Labour party want the party to wait much longer. And in his interview McDonnell confirmed that the party was considering a delay. He said the party was worried about Johnson trying to change the date. The problem that we had is that we couldn\u2019t determine the date of the election. Of course, Boris Johnson might come along say\u201d \u2018I promise you it will be such and such a date.\u2019 But he\u2019s not renowned ... for delivering on what he says ... We can\u2019t trust him. It\u2019s not just me; it\u2019s his own side. McDonnell said Labour was consulting on how a bill to amend the FTPA could be used to fix the date of a general election. A bill could set 15 October as the date for the election. But McDonnell also said there was a case for holding it later, after the EU summit in October. He said: The problem that we\u2019ve got is that we cannot at the moment have any confidence in Boris Johnson abiding by any commitment or deal that we could construct. That\u2019s the truth of it. So we\u2019re now consulting about whether it\u2019s better to go long, therefore, rather than to go short. And that decision will be taken. Although McDonnell did not acknowledge it, another advantage for Labour in delaying the election until November is that, if Brexit had to be delayed, the Conservatives would get hammered by the Brexit party. Despite what Corbyn said in the debate last night, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says Corbyn is saying in private that he is going to wait. General elections are all about choices and what Boris Johnson has been been doing this week has been trying to frame the forthcoming election as a choice between someone who will deliver Brexit by 31 October and someone who won\u2019t. CCHQ could not be clearer about this. This message is also set out in the statement issued by Number 10 this morning. (See 7.48am.) But Johnson is also saying that he wants to get Brexit over so that he can go on to focus on issues like health and education. Here is another extract from the statement Number 10 released to journalists this morning. Since becoming prime minister, Boris has promised more investment for our NHS, more police on our streets to tackle violent crime and more funding for our schools to ensure every child has an excellent education, regardless of where they live. He has already delivered on his promises to level up the country and he wants to continue this agenda. But to do this we must deliver Brexit. There is an irony in this. As one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign, you would have thought that Johnson might be proud of Brexit. But now it is as if he is very keen to change the subject. The argument is also flawed, in at least two respects. First, the government does not need to leave the EU to spend more money on public services etc. In fact, all mainstream economic analysis says Brexit will leave less money for these services. And second, even after the UK has left the EU, the argument about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU will continue for years. Brexit is not going to vanish as a story anytime soon. So why is No 10 pushing this argument? Because voters like to hear it, according to Politico\u2019s Jack Blanchard. Here is an extract from his London Playbook briefing yesterday. [A senior government minister] also predicted the opposition parties are playing straight into [Dominic] Cummings\u2019 hands \u2014 and that the Tories are now on course to win a snap election. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the numbers from CCHQ, it really is black and white,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople want it done. They love it when we talk about schools, hospitals and police; they love it when we talk about broadband; they hate it when we talk about Brexit \u2014 and these people have just voted to talk more about Brexit. Nobody wants to spend three, six months rowing about Brexit.\u201d To repeat, this may well prove to be the case. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Last night Boris Johnson lost the vote on calling an early election. Rather, he won the vote \u2013 MPs voted in favour by 298 to 56 \u2013 but effectively he lost, because under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he needed a two-thirds majority, not a simple one. Nothing is straightforward any more. Nevertheless Downing Street is briefing this morning that it considers today to be the first day of the general election campaign. Boris Johnson is making a regional visit, and this afternoon he will be making a speech, and taking questions from journalists. There is plenty more on the agenda. Here is the diary for the day. 9.30am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: The high court hears the legal challenge brought by Gina Miller and others against Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a Commons statement on next week\u2019s Commons business. 11am: Johnson holds talks with the Israeli PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Downing Street. After 11am: Peers will debate a new business motion, designed to ensure that the Benn bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October passes all its Lords stages by 5pm tomorrow. 12pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. 12.15pm: Johnson holds talks with the US vice-president, Mike Pence, in Downing Street. Afternoon: Johnson gives a speech outside London. Damian Green, the former cabinet minister and leader of the One Nation group of Conservatives, has called for the reinstatement of the 21 rebels kicked out of the party. Speaking to the BBC he said: I\u2019m afraid it does look as though somebody has decided that the moderate, progressive wing of the Conservative party is not wanted on voyage. That\u2019s wrong in principle because there are many Conservative traditions, but it is terrible practical politics to narrow your appeal just before a general election. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has refused to deny that he objected to the expulsion of the 21 Tory MPs who voted against the government on bill to block a no deal. Asked on BBC Breakfast about reports of a row in cabinet over the issue, Javid said: I\u2019m not going to get into discussions I\u2019ve had with the prime minister, but I am sad to see 21 colleagues no longer carrying the conservative whip. These are my friends. These are good people. But they also knew that that when the prime minister of the day says a vote is a matter of confidence, what would be the consequences of opposing that. This is not something I wanted to see. But we do need to step back and think about how do we deliver on the central mission to leave the EU by October 31 and continue to govern this country in a way that the people are feeling that their priorities are being met. Javid, who spoke out against proroguing parliament to force through Brexit during the Tory leadership debate, offered muted backing for the move. He said during the leadership debate he was objecting to suspending parliament \u201cfor months\u201d. He added: Proroguing parliament for a Queen\u2019s speech is perfectly correct, especially when there\u2019s plenty of time to debate things as we\u2019ve seen this week. Javid also backed Johnson\u2019s call for an early election: Since the 2017 election, we\u2019ve had a parliament that keeps saying what it doesn\u2019t want when it comes to Brexit, but it is not deciding on what it wants. We\u2019ve just got to the point now that we need to let the people decide who should govern this country. And the choice is going to be clear: they can choose Jeremy Corbyn, and all his dithering and his desire to ignore the will of the people and stay in the EU. Or they can choose Boris Johnson, who will not only deliver on that central promise to leave the EU, but also on the people\u2019s priorities. Boris Johnson appears to be preparing for another lectern moment. A Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister would today \u201cspeak directly to the public, setting out the vital choice that faces our country\u201d. The spokesman added: He will argue that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u2018surrender bill\u2019 will force the prime minister to go to Brussels and surrender to any demands they make. This would in essence overturn the biggest democratic vote in our history - the 2016 referendum. The PM will not do this. It is clear the only action is to go back to the people and give them the opportunity to decide what they want: Boris to go to Brussels and get a deal, or leave without one on 31 October or Jeremy Corbyn arriving in Brussels with his surrender bill begging for more delay, more dither and accepting whatever terms Brussels imposes over our nation. For Jeremy Corbyn to continue to avoid an election would be a cowardly insult to democracy. The petition against proroguing parliament, which was signed by more than 1.7m people, will be debated on Monday. It only needed 100,000 signatures to secure a debate. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has played down Keir Starmer\u2019s suggestion that Labour would only back an early election after the bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit has been implemented. Speaking to Sky News, McDonnell said: Keir said that is one of the options, that\u2019s why we are consulting. There\u2019s a range of views in the parliamentary Labour party. But if we are going to have control of the date we\u2019ve got to bring the other opposition parties with us. I think we\u2019ll reach a consensus. But we\u2019ve got to block a no deal. McDonnell said Labour wanted to back an election once the Benn bill seeking an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline, had passed into law. He said: Jeremy has said once the legislation is through we want a general election ourselves. We are consulting now, so it is all about timing. There\u2019s no tug of war within the Labour party. We are consulting now the other opposition parties. He also accused Boris Johnson of behaving like a toddler in demanding an election now. He said: If you\u2019ve been a parent, this is like dealing with two- or three-year-old having a tantrum ... So you let them have their tantrum and you you have to be the grown-up in the room. And the grown-up in the room is saying: \u2018Fine, have your tantrum, but we are not going to allow you take this country out on a no-deal Brexit, because you will undermine our economy.\u2019 George Monbiot has pointed out the different ways yesterday\u2019s events were covered in the Sun in England and Scotland. Among the more baffling things that happened last night was that Jacob Rees-Mogg posted this video, spoofing him lounging in parliament, onto his official Instagram account. \u2018You great big girl\u2019s blouse\u2019 \u2013 Johnson accused of sexism for remark in debate You may have missed this moment in parliament yesterday with everything that was going on, but at one point during Boris Johnson\u2019s first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions he appeared to call out to Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cCall an election, you great big girl\u2019s blouse.\u201d As my colleague Martin Belam writes, the comment was immediately seized upon on social media, with users suggesting the comment was sexist and not a fitting for the prime minister to say in parliament. Johnson has form for previously using the phrase. In June 2017 he called Labour\u2019s election campaign chief a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d. And in 2007, when Gordon Brown was tipped to be on the verge of calling a general election in an era before the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, he reportedly told a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool that if Brown didn\u2019t act: \u201cWe will say he\u2019s wimped out, we will say he\u2019s a big girl\u2019s blouse.\u201d Johnson also raised eyebrows by swearing during the course of one of his answers in PMQs, quoting shadow education secretary Angela Rayner\u2019s description of Labour\u2019s economic policy as \u201cshit or bust\u201d. Rayner described Johnson\u2019s performance as dreadful. How the papers covered it Boris Johnson\u2019s failed bid to trigger a general election next month dominates coverage today, with papers either focusing on the humiliation of his defeat, many of which say the prime minister is a \u201ccornered\u201d man, or on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s refusal to back Johnson\u2019s calls for a vote. Lords agree to push through bill preventing no deal by end of Friday \u2013 video Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of whatever political shenanigans today is going to throw at us. Welcome especially to any members of the House of Lords who might happen to follow this live blog and who had a late night on Wednesday. Our honourable friends in the upper house were up debating the Benn bill until the wee hours when the deadlock finally broke and Lords voted in favour of getting the bill, which rules out a no-deal Brexit and was passed by the House of Commons earlier this week, through all stages of parliament by Friday afternoon, before parliament is suspended by Boris Johnson. That agreement was reached around 1:30am on Thursday when peers passed a business motion that means the Benn bill will be returned to the lower house by 5pm on Friday, ruling out the prospect of attempts at a filibuster. From there, the bill can be voted on again by MPs on Monday and presented for royal assent. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support calls for a snap general election if the Benn bill preventing a no-deal Brexit received royal assent, so this is a significant step. Peers are set to debate the Benn bill itself and amendments today. We\u2019ll be bringing you news of that debate, and everything else that is going on, as it happens. As I have been throughout the week, I\u2019ll be kicking things off before handing over to my colleagues. Please get in touch via the comments, on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). Let\u2019s get cracking.",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s your match report: Remember when Williams was a teen phenom? No? Here\u2019s a stat to remind you: And indeed she does. That\u2019s all for tonight. See you for the final, 4 p.m. ET Saturday. That\u2019s Williams\u2019 101st win at the U.S. Open. She can tie Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24 Grand Slam titles if she wins the final. She keeps breaking ESPN commentator Chris Evert\u2019s Open records and would do so again with a win Saturday that would give her seven championships here, one ahead of Evert. Technically, she has a losing record against her possible final opponent, Canadian teen Bianca Andreescu. They\u2019ve only played once, when Williams had to retire from their matchup in the Rogers Cup last month. Williams certainly seems to be feeling better. As George Hurley said by email, \u201cJust too too much power.\u201d And she\u2019s covering the court well, as Svitolina found to her chagrin with a couple of drop shots that didn\u2019t flummox Williams in the least. If you come at the queen, you\u2019d best not miss, and Elina Svitolina missed a lot tonight. So many early chances in the first few games went begging, and you simply cannot let such opportunities slip when Serena Williams is being Serena Williams. Svitolina recovered pretty well and played evenly through the last few games of the first set. She started well in the second set but then simply withered in the face of Williams\u2019 onslaught. And Svitolina was surely the top opponent left for Williams -- not just the highest remaining seed but someone very much in form. Williams picks apart Svitolina on the first point and has her on the ropes on the second, but Svitolina comes back with a couple of terrific shots -- one in the corner, one drop shot and then a simple putaway. Then an ace to make it 30-15. Then yet another missed opportunity. Svitolina has Williams in trouble on the baseline, and she rushes the net. But she loses her footing and sends a weak shot across to Williams, who makes no mistake. 30-30. Svitolina into the net, and it\u2019s break and match point. Fault. Second serve barely in. But Williams offers up a lifeline with an unforced and simply unnecessary error. Deuce. Then another, and it\u2019s advantage Svitolina. How many game points has Svitolina lost now? This one is a long rally that ends on another pinpoint Williams shot on the baseline. Deuce. Then another good rally, but Williams just keeps hitting harder and harder and finally forces the error. Second match point. Another decent rally, but Williams rips a backhand for her 34rd winner and the match. Second set: *Williams 6-3 5-1 Svitolina (denotes server) Point for Williams. Point for Williams on another wild mishit from Svitolina. Then 40-0 as a return goes way long. Finally, Svitolina breaks a streak of 13 straight lost points with a solid return that Williams puts into the net. Another solid rally follows, but Williams puts a forehand winner on the line. Svitolina is just serving for a respectable score now. Second set: Williams 6-3 4-1 Svitolina* (denotes server) The first point is a fun one, as the players trade drop shots and both end up at the net as if they\u2019re playing doubles. Williams wins the next point more conventionally, then wins another net point by covering a lot of ground to send Svitolina\u2019s drop shot across the court for a winner. The rattled Svitolina then sends a shot wide, and Williams breaks at love. Second set: *Williams 6-3 3-1 Svitolina (denotes server) Williams holds at love, finishing it off with an ace. Not too long ago, Svitolina was pretty close in the \u201ctotal points won\u201d stat, but it\u2019s all going Serena\u2019s way now. Can\u2019t pick many better sights than this ... You could argue that a legend should have better seats, but maybe those are better seats. Second set: Williams 6-3 2-1 Svitolina* (denotes server) One of the sloppier games of the match, and it couldn\u2019t be worse for Svitolina, who can\u2019t take advantage of Williams\u2019 sudden string of unforced errors. A fantastic rally in which Svitolina approached the net and had to move back ends with a Svitolina moon shot that gives Williams break point. But Williams hits wide. Svitolina surrenders the advantage, then hits long to give Williams a break. It\u2019s a long way back now. Second set: *Williams 6-3 1-1 Svitolina (denotes server) This is peak Serena. She\u2019ll make a mistake, such as a double fault that takes it to 30-30, and then she simply storms back with an emphatic winner at the net before closing out the game. Second set: Williams 6-3 0-1 Svitolina* (denotes server) Well, that\u2019s better for Svitolina. An ace closes it out as she holds at love. Abhijato Sensarma asks: \u201cDoes it look like Williams has shrugged off her recently-acquired nerves when it comes to the final stages of a Slam? Or might it still relapse even at the moment everything seems to be going in her favour?\u201d She certainly doesn\u2019t seem nervous here. Svitolina has created her own opportunities here, but she has flinched, and Williams has not. Beautiful winner for Svitolina as Williams approaches the net, but she struggles with Williams\u2019 second serve on the next point. 15-15. Williams makes no mistake at the net, taking it to 30-15. More power, and it\u2019s double set point. She only needs one, hitting a serve that Svitolina can only return to the net. Svitolina will have to shake off all her missed opportunities to get back into this. First set: Williams 5-3 Svitolina* (denotes server) Svitolina hits long on the first point. Williams does the same on the next point, then mishits a return to give Svitolina a 30-15 lead. Svitolina double-faults and again swats the ball away in frustration. But Svitolina\u2019s next serve is a good one, and Williams can\u2019t get it back over the net. Game point. Can Svitolina finally hit a winner to close out a game? Not on this one -- she hits far wide. Deuce. Williams gives up another game point with an errant shot. Then another, and Svitolina stays in the set. First set: *Williams 5-2 Svitolina (* denotes server) No break points this time. Williams wins four quick points, barely giving Svitolina a chance to return anything. First set: Williams 4-2 Svitolina* (* denotes server) To twist the soccer cliche, a 40-0 lead is the most dangerous lead in tennis. At least, that\u2019s been the case for Svitolina tonight. She earns the lead with an ace, upheld after checking the replay. Svitolina has a textbook unforced error on the next point. But she comes back with a solid rally, moving Williams around a bit. Williams hits a tough shot into the net, and Svitolina takes another game. First set: *Williams 4-1 Svitolina (* denotes server) And now Williams looks rattled. A simple shot at the net goes into the net. A backhand goes wide. Fault. Second serve is returned, and Williams immediately hits back into the net. Again, three chances to win the game for Svitolina. This time, all on Williams\u2019 serve. She can bring the set back on serve. Williams unleashes the power. Two solid points and then a dominant point, with a serve that Svitolina barely returns and a follow-up shot that no one could return. Deuce. Three more chances gone for Svitolina. A medium-length rally ends with Svitolina hitting just long. Williams closes out with her usual power. Svitolina is 0-for-6 on break points, and she had plenty of chances to win the game in which she was broken herself. First set: Williams 3-1 Svitolina* (* denotes server) Svitolina gets triple game point this time, hitting composed shots and outlasting Williams on a long second point. An ace takes it to 40-0. Williams offers up a tantalizing drop shot that doesn\u2019t drop enough. Svitolina has the court at her mercy as she runs to the net. She hits wide. 40-15. The next serve goes into the net. But Williams takes the pressure off with her own unforced error, blasting a backhand long. Finally. First set: *Williams 3-0 Svitolina (* denotes server) Serena holds at love, and Svitolina wasn\u2019t in a single point. Those missed chances are surely haunting her. First set: Williams 2-0 Svitolina* (* denotes server) Shakespeare has written plays shorter than this description of an epic second game. Svitolina races through the first three points. Williams wins the next, and Svitolina double-faults to make it 40-30. A strong Williams return brings it to deuce, then another strong return leaves Svitolina staring as the ball whips past her for a Williams break point. Back to deuce. Svitolina misses her first serve and angrily swats the ball into the net. Williams wins the long rally off the second serve with an impossible angle. Another break point. But Williams\u2019 next return finds the net. Svitolina comes within an inch of an ace on the next serve, barely copes with Williams\u2019 next return, chases all over the court as Williams comes to the net, then whacks the ball off Williams\u2019 racket and out. If she meant to do that, that was awesome. Advantage Svitolina. The Ukrainian just can\u2019t close out a game. Her first serve goes miles wide. Williams blasts the second one for a winner. Deuce. Serve, return, winner for Svitolina, and again she has game point. And this time she double-faults. Williams returns long. Advantage Svitolina. Williams rips one deep into the corner. Deuce. Finally, Williams hits a fierce backhand winner, then another. Break. Svitolina had three chances to win the first game and four chances to win this one. She\u2019s down 0-2. From the inbox, a while ago, Elisabeth Stewart takes issue with the pre-match comments: \u201cWow. Your little Serena-bashing silliness is kinda uncalled for. But oooo, the blonde Svitolina-- nothing but drooling!\u201d Just checked back and didn\u2019t notice any saliva, but thanks for the concern. First set: *Williams 1-0 Svitolina (* denotes server) First serve good, second serve not so good. Williams hits long a couple of times to give Svitolina an early edge. After interrupting that run, Williams has to stretch to reach a well-placed return, and Svitolina easily slams it past her to go up 15-40 and take two break points. Williams holds both of those and then another, then runs Svitolina around the court to take the advantage. Another good serve sets up Williams to hold serve, but she dumps a shot into the net. Deuce again. Finally, Williams powers her way through two points, the latter with an opportunistic race to the net that prompts Svitolina to hit wide. That took 12 points. This match will likely be longer than Williams\u2019 quarterfinal. And now ESPN\u2019s Pam Shriver is chatting with the coach whose signals started the Williams v umpire showdown, Patrick Mouratoglou. He keeps chatting while Williams misses her first serve and then hits long in a brief rally. In case you forgot, last year\u2019s U.S. Open final was a nightmare for Williams, who got in a battle of escalating hostilities with the chair umpire in the final before losing to Naomi Osaka. Possibly a bit of a chip on her shoulder this time around. Svitolina is currently ranked 909th in doubles. Please start this match at some point. Serena refers to the Open as her \u201chometown Grand Slam,\u201d though it\u2019s pretty far from California (where she grew up) and Florida (where she lives now). Her voice sounds a little scratchy. She\u2019s wearing warmup gear that looks a bit like a wetsuit. A surprising number of empty seats around the lower level. Meanwhile, Azarenka and Barty have closed out the women\u2019s doubles semifinal 6-0, 6-1. Somehow, that took nearly an hour. Fun fact from ESPN: Svitolina would be the ninth player to beat both Williams sisters in the same tournament. Yes, it\u2019s 7 p.m. Eastern time. But we have to get through ads, pre-match festivities, another 45 minutes on an NFL player who isn\u2019t playing, etc. Meanwhile, in women\u2019s doubles, Victoria Azarenka and Ashleigh Barty lead Viktoria Kuzmova and Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-0, 3-1. Azarenka and Sasnovich are both from Belarus. The winners of the women\u2019s doubles draw take home $740,000. Serena\u2019s late-round Grand Slam career is old enough to vote in the United States: Svitolina retweeted this tweet, so she must enjoy her public meditation: Who is Elina Svitolina? A few basic facts: She\u2019s ranked fifth in the world This is her second straight Slam semi-final after her breakthrough at Wimbledon this summer, where she lost to Simona Halep, who went on to win the final against ... Serena Williams. She\u2019ll be 25 years old next week. She\u2019s dating Gael Monfils, a perennial crowd favorite who reached the quarterfinals in the men\u2019s draw here at the U.S. Open this year. She lost her first four matches against Serena but won their most recent meeting at the 2016 Olympics. Good evening all. Will we see another Serena Williams rout? Another Serena Williams meltdown? On the other side of the court, for all the talk of the bracket clearing out for Serena, Elina Svitolina is as formidable an opponent as you could find in women\u2019s tennis. So the chances of a memorable match here are quite high. Join us to talk about it. Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Tumaini Carayol on tonight\u2019s match up: By the end of Serena Williams\u2019 44-minute 6-1, 6-0 obliteration of China\u2019s Wang Qiang on Tuesday night she seemed unplayable.

      "bodyText": "The Carolinas are already seeing the effects of Hurricane Dorian, with hundreds of thousands losing power as the storm\u2019s rain and wind intensified. A Texas man was the first charged for violating the new bump stock ban. Meanwhile, Trump continued to repeat his false claim that the storm was projected to hit Alabama when he tweeted about the alleged threat to the state on Sunday. He even got an advisor to release a statement backing him up. The Trump administration released a plan to privatize Fannie and Freddie. The administration also continued in its rollback of environmental laws. After reversing energy-saving lightbulb rules, Trump is planning to make it harder for states to set extra stringent automobile gas mileage standards. The Government Accountability Office said Trump\u2019s interior department violated the law in keeping national parks open during the government shutdown. Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, Jason Greenblatt, is resigning even though the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he has been working on with Jared Kushner remains unreleased. A Mother Jones investigation revealed that a mysterious $50m debt held by Trump may signal tax fraud. Joe Biden is continuing with a fundraiser co-hosted by the co-founder of a natural gas company, despite activists\u2019 complaints that the event violates the spirit of \u201cNo Fossil Fuel Money Pledge,\u201d which Biden has signed. The administration is also planning a proposal to revoke part of California\u2019s authority to set its own gas mileage standards, the AP reports: The Environmental Protection Agency was preparing paperwork for the White House for the move, meant to help the administration set a single, less rigorous mileage standard enforceable nationwide, according to the official, who is familiar with the regulatory process and spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan has not been made public. President Donald Trump has pushed for months to weaken Obama-era mileage standards nationwide and has targeted California\u2019s decades-old power to set its own mileage standards as part of that effort. The Trump administration\u2019s broad housing reforms include a plan to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2014 the two companies behind about half of the country\u2019s mortgages The proposal released today includes plans to shrink Fannie and Freddie\u2019s dominant market shares and create new competitors to the companies. More from Reuters: The Treasury\u2019s plan, released in a 53-page report, marks the first major effort to jump-start housing finance reform in Washington after a failed 2012 attempt by the Obama administration. The report calls for recuperating Fannie and Freddie and removing them from their government lifeline, but it strikes a cautious tone by failing to commit to concrete timelines or a specific recapitalization plan. It commits to preserving the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, a cornerstone of the U.S. mortgage market, and leans heavily on Congress to implement several critical measures, including the creation of an explicit guarantee for Fannie and Freddie\u2019s mortgage-backed securities. The Trump administration illegally diverted national park fees to keep the parks open through the government shutdown, the Government Accountability Office said. Entrance fees paid by visitors are meant to be used for their maintenance and enhancement, rather than daily operations. But during the month-long shutdown, the Interior Department redirected the money to keep the parks open with minimal staff. As a result, trashcans overflowed and vandals chopped down trees and littered pristine landscapes. The superintendent of Joshua Tree National Park said it could take hundreds of years for the park to recover from damage caused by the longest shutdown in US history. The GAO said the Interior Department moved money between accounts violated federal law in reallocating funds without congressional approval. \u201cThe administration played a shell game with national park money in order to keep parks open,\u201d the CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association said in a statement. A federal grand jury has indicted a 43-year-old Houston man for possession of a bump stock. Ajay Dhingra, 43, drew attention from law enforcement after he called the George Bush Foundation and left a concerning message. When authorities looked into the case, they discovered that \u201cDhingra had previously been committed to a mental institution, according to the allegations. As such, he is prohibited by federal law of possessing a firearm or ammunition,\u201d according to a statement from the Southern District of Texas. Bump stocks are attachments that essentially allow shooters to continuously fire with one pull of the trigger. The gunman responsible for the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting that killed 58 people used a bump stock. The Trump administration\u2019s ban went into effect in March. Donald Trump just won\u2019t drop the whole Alabama thing... The White House released a new statement from Trump\u2019s homeland security and counterterrorism advisor, who says he briefed the president on Hurricane Dorian and maps that \u201cshowed the possibility of storm force winds hitting parts of Alabama\u201d. Drugstores CVS and Walgreens, as well as grocery chain Wegmans are the latest retailers asking customers to refrain from openly carrying guns while shopping. Walmart \u2014 the largest US retailer \u2014 and the grocery chain Kroger made similar announcements this week. None of the companies are banning open carrying outright, because they don\u2019t want to \u201cput employees into confrontational situations\u201d the AP reports. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Carolinas are already seeing the effects of Hurricane Dorian, with hundreds of thousands losing power as the storm\u2019s rain and wind intensify. Follow our live coverage of the hurricane for the latest updates. Meanwhile, Trump continues to repeat his false claim that the storm was projected to hit Alabama when he tweeted about the alleged threat to the state on Sunday. Just in case you\u2019ve missed the 1,000 or so fact-checks: that is not true. Boris Johnson remains adamant that he will not request a Brexit extension, despite the British prime minister\u2019s multiple political defeats in recent days. (And yes, the Guardian has a live blog for the latest on that, too.) Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, Jason Greenblatt, is resigning even though the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he has been working on with Jared Kushner remains unreleased. A Mother Jones investigation revealed that a mysterious $50m debt held by Trump may signal tax fraud. Joe Biden is continuing with a fundraiser co-hosted by the co-founder of a natural gas company, despite activists\u2019 complaints that the event violates the spirit of \u201cNo Fossil Fuel Money Pledge,\u201d which Biden has signed. Maanvi will have more updates on the news of the day, so stay tuned. A CNN analyst neatly summarized Joe Biden\u2019s continued dominance in the polls despite a series of embarrassing gaffes that many commentators predicted would affect his front-runner status. Meanwhile, Trump is still refusing to acknowledge that he was wrong when he tweeted Sunday about the threat Hurricane Dorian posed to Alabama. But as this blog and many, many others have reported, Dorian\u2019s projected path did not include Alabama by the time that Trump sent a tweet suggesting so on Sunday. It\u2019s baffling why the president would want to keep returning to a false claim that has been relentlessly fact-checked even as the effects of Dorian continue to be felt by states other than Alabama. The president\u2019s refusal to acknowledge this fact falls in line with his general reluctance to ever admit fault, but much like his former press secretary\u2019s claims about his inauguration crowd size, this appears to be a fight between Trump and reality itself. Our colleague Oliver Laughland is in Nassau as Bahamians grapple with the devastation Hurricane Dorian has brought to the country. Laughland reports: I\u2019m at the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Nassau where a delegation of Caribbean leaders just departed for a fly over trip to see the destruction on Abaco Islands. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados is part of the delegation and took a minute to talk to the Guardian about her thoughts on hurricane Dorian\u2019s links to the climate crisis. She did not pull her punches. \u2018We are on the front line of the consequences of climate change but we don\u2019t cause it,\u2019 she said. \u2018And the vulnerability that attaches therefore to us is a matter we\u2019re trying to get the international community to deal with consistently.\u2019 Follow the Guardian\u2019s Hurricane Dorian live blog for more updates from Laughland in Nassau. Joe Biden is resisting calls to cancel a fundraiser co-hosted by Andrew Goldman, who co-founded a natural gas company. Activists are complaining that the event would violate the \u201cNo Fossil Fuel Money Pledge,\u201d which Biden has signed. During last night\u2019s climate town hall, Biden appeared open to canceling the event, but it now appears he\u2019s moving forward with it. One of Biden\u2019s advisers defended the move by pointing out that Goldman is not involved in the day-to-day operation of Western LNG. But that explanation is not cutting it for climate activists, who have complained that the fundraiser violates the spirit of the pledge. It also gives more ammunition to some of Biden\u2019s opponents, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have criticized the former vice president\u2019s reliance on high-dollar fundraisers. More bad news for Pence: Nancy Pelosi has issued a statement arguing that the vice president\u2019s stay at Trump\u2019s Ireland golf club violated the Constitution. \u201cVice President Pence promised that their Administration would defend the Constitution and stand by a \u2018strict constructionist\u2019 interpretation of the Constitution. Instead the Trump-Pence Administration is ignoring the text itself and selling out the Constitution to line Trump\u2019s pockets,\u201d the Democratic House speaker said. \u201cTrump properties are a cesspool of corruption, a black hole for taxpayers\u2019 money, an exploiter of immigrant labor and a national security threat with a suspected foreign spy walking the halls. ... The American people deserve a government that serves their interests, not one that\u2019s being exploited to line the President\u2019s pockets.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help matters that Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, told reporters Trump had made a \u201csuggestion\u201d that the vice president stay at his property. Short later walked that back, claiming it was a result of misreporting. Again: the reporting was based on his own comments. Mike Pence is in London, where he met with Boris Johnson earlier today. The vice president has echoed Trump\u2019s support of the British prime minister and his Brexit timeline, but he dodged questions about Johnson\u2019s political fortunes. Pence\u2019s Europe trip on the whole has been rocky at best. He has raised ethical questions for staying at Trump\u2019s Ireland golf club, offended Irish officials by promoting Brexit during his visit and faced scorn in Iceland over his record on LGBT rights. He\u2019ll likely be happy to return to the United States, where a new book is being published later this month on the vice president\u2019s rise to power and relationship with Trump. The book\u2019s release could spell trouble for Pence, given how little this president enjoys sharing the spotlight. Trump\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, rejected any suggestion that the departure of Jason Greenblatt signaled trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he was working on. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, has been crafting the peace plan with Greenblatt for months, but it remains unreleased. The administration has said it will release the plan after the Israeli elections on Sept. 17, but no specific date has been offered. Trump herself is currently on a five-day tour of South America to promote female entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, across the pond, Boris Johnson has remained adamant that he will not delay Brexit, despite multiple political defeats that have left the British prime minister somewhat hamstrung. During a rambling and odd press conference today, Johnson said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than request a Brexit extension. The Guardian\u2019s UK politics live blogger, Andrew Sparrow, called it \u201cthe most extraordinary prime ministerial press conference we\u2019ve seen for years.\u201d Follow the blog for more updates on the latest from London. A mysterious $50 million debt that Trump owes to a business called Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC, which the president fully owns, may be a sign of tax fraud, experts say. Mother Jones reports in a newly published investigation: Donald Trump\u2019s massive debts\u2014he owes hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014are the subject of continuous congressional and journalistic scrutiny. But for years, one Trump loan has been particularly mystifying: a debt of more than $50 million that Trump claims he owes to one of his own companies. According to tax and financial experts, the loan, which Trump has never fully explained, might be part of a controversial tax avoidance scheme known as debt parking. Yet a Mother Jones investigation has uncovered information that raises questions about the very existence of this loan, presenting the possibility that this debt was concocted as a ploy to evade income taxes\u2014a move that could constitute tax fraud. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke is providing Twitter updates on his trip from New York to Boston via bus. A spokesperson for O\u2019Rourke, who was in New York to participate in CNN\u2019s climate-focused town hall yesterday, said the bus option cuts down on how much his travel contributes to pollution. Representative Doug Collins, the top-ranking Republican on the House judiciary committee who has frequently defended Trump against calls for his impeachment, is pushing to be named the next senator of Georgia. The New York Times reports: Mr. Collins is moving swiftly. Just a week after Senator Johnny Isakson, a fellow Republican, unexpectedly announced that he would retire at year\u2019s end, Mr. Collins has emerged as one of the most serious contenders among a dozen or so Republicans thought to be interested in the position. Under Georgia rules, Governor Brian Kemp can appoint a temporary replacement for Mr. Isakson this year and call for a special election in November 2020 to complete the final two years of Mr. Isakson\u2019s term. Mr. Collins\u2019s allies in Washington and Georgia are privately making the case that, as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, he has the national profile and fund-raising prowess to hold the seat against what is expected to be energized and well-funded Democratic challenges in 2020 and again in 2022. And Mr. Collins himself has placed calls stating his interest in the seat to Mr. Kemp and to Mr. Trump, a potentially powerful ally who could sway the governor\u2019s thinking, according to people familiar with the calls. It looks like Pete Buttigieg will soon be on Snapchat. The Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s campaign teased his new profile on Twitter. Buttigieg will join fellow 2020 contenders Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the platform, but some have mocked the candidates\u2019 Snapchats as a desperate attempt to pander to the youth vote. Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has joined the board of Priorities USA, the party\u2019s largest super PAC. \u201cStacey Abrams is an inspiring leader and a champion for voting rights in Georgia and around the nation,\u201d said Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil. \u201cWe are incredibly lucky to add her insight and critical experience to our organization\u2019s board and to get to fight along side her for the rights of all Americans, especially those whose voices are being silenced. We look forward to working together so that every American has a fair chance to participate in the democratic process.\u201d Abrams had been discussed as a possible Senate candidate in Georgia or even a potential presidential candidate, but she announced last month she would not enter the 2020 field and instead focus on her voting rights initiative. However, she has left the door open to becoming the running mate of the eventual Democratic nominee. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, took time out of her day to attack CNN for briefly showing a map that incorrectly labeled Alabama as Mississippi. The criticism seems, to this blog, pretty rich given that the president has apparently had some trouble reading maps this week and is notoriously reluctant to admit when he has made an error. Apparently, CNN\u2019s communications team had a similar response to Grisham\u2019s tweet. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Hurricane Dorian is making its way toward North Carolina amid warnings of flash flooding and a potentially life-threatening storm surge. Follow our live coverage to get the latest updates. Jason Greenblatt, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, is resigning as the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he has been working on with Jared Kushner remains unreleased. US-Chinese trade talks are set to resume next month, but Trump has shown no signs of backing down on his tariffs. Schools and daycares for military families are among the projects that will lose funding to pay for Trump\u2019s border wall. The blog is still keeping an eye on the storm and the turnover at the Trump White House, so stay tuned. Meanwhile, the White House has confirmed that Trump was referring to the private-sector ADP report when he tweeted about the job numbers. Some had raised concerns that Trump was referring to the official Bureau of Labor Statistics report, which will not be publicly released until tomorrow, and a 1985 policy directive prohibits the president from releasing the jobs numbers early. Palestine remains pessimistic about the peace plan that was being crafted by Greenblatt and Jared Kushner, as a senior Palestinian official wished the unreleased proposal \u201cgood riddance.\u201d Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement thanking Greenblatt for helping to craft an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Of course, the peace plan has not yet been released, partly due to the political instability in Israel as Netanyahu has struggled to craft a governing coalition. Elections will be held there on Sept. 17. Trump has confirmed over his favorite form of social media that his special envoy for the Middle East is leaving the administration. Greenblatt\u2019s responsibilities on the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan will be taken over by Avi Berkowitz, a close aide to Jared Kushner. Officials said Greenblatt, a former Trump Organization lawyer, was departing to spend more time with family, noting that he stayed in the administration longer than he originally intended. But a White House reporter for McClatchy said his exit underscored how much the peace plan has changed from how it was originally envisioned. The proposed peace plan from Greenblatt and Kushner has long been delayed and is now expected to be released after the Israeli elections on Sept. 17. But the plan is likely to face steep opposition from Palestinian officials, who have criticized Greenblatt and Kushner\u2019s process as unfairly deferential to Israel. Trump\u2019s envoy for the Middle East, Jason Greenblatt, plans to resign once the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he has been working on with Jared Kushner is released, officials said. Reuters reports: Greenblatt, who had intended to stay only two years when he began working at the White House in early 2017, is eager to return to his wife and six children who stayed behind at their home in New Jersey, the officials said. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said it was a \u201chumiliating\u201d moment when Trump presented a map of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s trajectory that had been altered with a Sharpie. \u201cI feel sorry for the President, and that is not the way we should feel about the most powerful figure in this country, somebody on whose wisdom and judgment our lives literally depend,\u201d the Indiana mayor told CNN. He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he felt it necessary to pull out a sharpie and change the map, I don\u2019t know if it was one of his aides believed they had to do that in order to protect his ego. No matter how you cut it, this is an unbelievably sad state of affairs for our country.\u201d The map had seemingly been altered to appear as though the hurricane might strike Alabama, even though meteorologists have said for days that the state is not in danger. Trump was called out for falsely claiming otherwise on Twitter over the weekend. US and Chinese negotiators have agreed to meet next month to restart trade talk, but there\u2019s little sign Trump will relent on his tariffs. Jasper Jolly reports: Senior negotiators will meet in early October, after a call on Wednesday night between the Chinese vice-premier, Liu He, and the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Officials from the two countries will hold discussions from mid-September to prepare the way for the talks. Traders welcomed the news, pushing Germany\u2019s trade-sensitive Dax index up 0.8% by midday BST. Shanghai\u2019s CSI 300 index closed more than 1% higher. Investors remain cautious, however, with little sign that Donald Trump has any appetite to back down despite the negative effects on the US economy ahead of the 2020 presidential election campaign. The president recently hailed his \u2018very successful trade battle\u2019 with China, and said he did not want the US to be \u2018servants to the Chinese\u2019. Trump is also tweeting about the jobs numbers, even though the White House won\u2019t get the official August report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics until later today. An economic reporter for the New York Times said the president was likely referring to a private-sector report. Hurricane Dorian is expected to move past South Carolina later today, and it will travel toward North Carolina tomorrow. As it does, there is a high risk of flash flooding in the Carolinas, and the storm\u2019s intense wind and rain has already caused power outages for thousands. Follow our live coverage of the hurricane to get the latest updates. Anyway, back to much more important matters. The death toll in the Bahamas from Hurricane Dorian has hit 20 and is expected to rise. Our colleague Oliver Laughland reports from Nassau: Aerial video of the Abaco Islands \u2013 a northern band of islands hardest hit by Dorian \u2013 showed widespread devastation, with the harbour, shops, workplaces, a hospital, and airport landing strips damaged or blown to pieces, all of which was frustrating rescue efforts. Dorian pummelled the area as a slow moving category 5 hurricane over the weekend. \u2018So many families have been deeply impacted\u2019 by Dorian, which \u2018has left generational devastation across Abaco and Grand Bahama\u2019, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a press conference late on Wednesday. \u2018We ask you to pray for the families and loved ones of the deceased,\u2019 added the PM, who had just returned from a flyover of the Abacos. Debra Messing, the actor sparking Trump\u2019s Twitter ire, tweeted this over the weekend in reaction to news of the president\u2019s Beverly Hills fundraiser. Some commentators, including Whoopi Goldberg on The View, compared Messing\u2019s request to Joseph McCarthy\u2019s list of alleged communist sympathizers in Hollywood during the 1950s. But Messing said she does not support blacklists, arguing that her interest in Trump\u2019s supporters is a first amendment issue. Messing also came under fire for liking a church sign in Alabama that read \u201ca black vote for Trump is mental illness\u201d. But the actor apologized for that matter. Even though Hurricane Dorian has strengthened back into a category 3 storm and could unleash life-threatening storm surge on the east coast, Trump is focusing on what really matters. Namely, he is calling out a sitcom star for her request that the names of those attending a Trump fundraiser in Beverly Hills be released. Good morning, live blog readers! Well, the list of military construction projects that will be affected by the diversion of funds for Donald Trump\u2019s border wall is out, and service members\u2019 families are among those affected. Schools and daycare centers for military families are just some of the 127 defense department projects that will lose their fundings to cover the cost of the wall that the president insisted Mexico would pay for. Trump has reportedly insisted that he cannot win re-election if he does not get the wall built, even as he continues to falsely claim the wall is already under construction. But will he really score political points by taking badly needed funding from military families? The calculus seems off, not to mention harmful. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will meet today with the CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra, and award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former NBA player Jerry West. Mike Pence is in the United Kingdom, where he will be speaking at the City London Corporation International Trade Dinner. Bernie Sanders will appear on Seth Meyers\u2019 late-night show. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Two Tamil asylum seekers and their Australian-born daughters will remain on Christmas Island for at least 12 days after a federal court hearing to determine whether they would be deported to Sri Lanka was delayed until 18 September. Priya, Nadesalingam and their two Australian-born children Kopika, four, and Tharunicaa, two, were sent to Christmas Island almost a week ago after the court granted an injunction preventing the government deporting Tharunicaa until the court application had been heard. The case centred around the fact that until this week the government had not considered whether Tharunicaa was owed protection under Australia\u2019s international obligations. Under the Migration Act, people who arrive to Australia by boat cannot apply for a visa while in Australia. Even though Tharunicaa was born in Australia, she is given the same visa status as her parents. But the immigration minister has the power to \u201clift the bar\u201d to allow her to apply for a visa. That injunction was extended until 4pm on Friday after the government revealed just before Wednesday\u2019s hearing that the Department of Home Affairs had referred the case to the immigration minister, David Coleman, on Tuesday, but he had decided not to lift the bar. The barrister for the government, Stephen Lloyd, argued on Wednesday the decision made the arguments to consider her case \u201cmoot\u201d. But Justice Mordecai Bromberg said, given the information had been provided at the last minute, he would extend the injunction for two days \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d. In the federal court on Friday, the case was delayed another week and a half to allow evidence to be filed in the court. Bromberg said that given the level of public interest in the case, it was important to state the interim orders keeping the family in Australia were just that, and it would be a while before any final orders to keep the family here would be considered. Outside the court, the family\u2019s lawyer, Carina Ford, said if the matter went on to a full hearing it could be months before a final decision were made. Until then, the family would remain in detention on Christmas Island, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not satisfactory that they remain in detention, I think everyone agrees with that, but that is not subject of this proceeding.\u201d The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has argued that the family could return to Sri Lanka and then reapply for a visa \u201cthe right way\u201d. But under the current system, the family would face a 12-month exclusion period preventing them reapplying. They would also be forced to pay back the cost for deportation to the government. A crowdfunding page set up this week has raised nearly $70,000 to help the family. Seven News reported on Thursday that the family could be fast-tracked to Australia if Nades applied for a work visa as an employee of Teys Australia\u2019s Biloela meatworks. For that to happen, the government would need to waive the waiting period. Ford said she had not been approached by the government on any deal. \u201cWe remain open to discussing alternative plans [but] we have not received anything from the department or the minister\u2019s office as to that option,\u201d she said. \u201cOur position is that we would not support them being returned to Sri Lanka to apply but we are open to discussing other options.\u201d Ford said the option was still there for Coleman to lift the bar to allow for an application for a visa while in Australia.",
